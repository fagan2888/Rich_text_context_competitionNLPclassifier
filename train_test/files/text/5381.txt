The domestic violence (DV) reforms of the 1980s and 1990s
were intended to compel police response to DV incidents
and the arrest of suspects. And, in fact, those reforms were
widely adopted in the United States and other countries with
Western style systems of justice. What has remained elu-
sive, to this point, are sufficient rates of case filing and crim-
inal conviction.
Most Police Investigations, Including
Into DV, Fail to Generate Criminal
Cases
Generally speaking, most police investigations do not result
in a prosecutorial decision to file criminal charges.As Stanko
(1981) reports " . . . many arrests which are made during
routine police work are treated . . . as garbage cases," adding
"For the [prosecutor] . . . arrest represents the raw data from
which to select felony cases" (p. 402, 404). More recently,
Stanko followed 677 cases submitted for prosecution; of
those, less than 25% resulted in the filing of criminal charges.
Of those, the conviction rate was 31%. Assessing the cause
of such a dismal rate of prosecution, Stanko (2007) con-
cluded that lack of investigative thoroughness had a "mas-
sive impact on attrition" (Slide 17).1
A study of 17,534 arrests for different types of felony
crimes in Washington, D.C., in 1974 showed that more than
half of all of the cases were rejected outright by prosecutors,
and 15% more were dropped after the case was filed. Only
8.4% of the investigations resulted in a plea of guilt (Forst,
Lucianovic, & Cox, 1977).2 In 1982, the National Institute of
Justice (NIJ/Forst, Leahy, Shirhall, Tyson, & Bartolomeo,
1982) examined the data from eight prosecutorial authori-
ties,3 finding an average, unweighted initial rejection rate of
29%, with another 14%4 later dismissed by the prosecutor.
Things have not changed much since then. Using meta-
analytical data specific to DV crime, Garner and Maxwell
determined the baseline, non-arrest rate of prosecution for
DV cases in the United States after 1995 to be 30% (2009,
Table 5). In other words, on average, slightly more than two
thirds of all baseline, non-arrest DV investigations are
rejected by prosecutors. Overall, these data suggest that
police officers in the United States are not doing a very good
job persuading prosecutors to file DV criminal charges, a
criticism long levied by advocates (e.g., Avakame & Fyfe,
2001; Bailey, 2010; Berk & Loseke, 1980; Buzawa &
Buzawa, 2003; Dobash & Dobash, 1979; Hoctor, 1997;
Stalans & Finn, 2000).

The Relationship Between Individual
Police Officer Work Habits and the
Stated Reasons Prosecutors Reject Their
Domestic Violence Investigations
Eric L. Nelson1
Abstract
In the United States, 70% of all non-arrest domestic violence (DV) police investigations are rejected by prosecutors. Using
DV investigation data, the routine work habits of two groups of police officers were compared across six measures. Cases
submitted by routinely lower effort (RLE) officers are rejected 270% more often, sustaining an average of 4.00 criticisms each,
compared to 2.21 for routinely greater effort (RGE) officers. RLE officers submit ambiguous investigations (58% v. 0%), and
cases with insufficient evidence (74% vs. 36%). The Proficiency Score (P Score) quantitative monitoring method is presented
and validated. This method identifies RLE officers, and also specific areas of deficient individual investigative practice in need
of improvement. With improvement, rates of prosecution and conviction for DV crime should increase substantially.

The academy has failed to comprehensively investigate
the how and why of case rejection. As shall be seen, only a
small amount of attention has been paid to a few reasons for
rejection of cases across a range of aggregated crimes; but, to
date, no study has examined the range of reasons that DV
cases are rejected by prosecutors, upon their presentation by
police. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to collect and
analyze these data, focused particularly on a search for clues
into the origins of "garbage DV cases."
First though, in order to gain a better understanding of why
prosecutors reject most DV cases, we must examine the infor-
mation source upon which prosecutors mostly rely when
deciding whether to file a DV criminal case, which being the
written report of the first responding police officer (FRPO).
The Police Report
It is important to understand the heavy dependence of
reviewing prosecutors upon the FRPO's written report. It is
true, prosecutors may interview the victim, or some of the
witnesses, or perhaps have an investigator do more research;
but, these subsequent actions follow onto the evidence an
officer memorializes in her/his written report. If the FRPO
did not interview a neighbor looking through a window, if an
officer did not ask about broken table leg, and so forth--then
the reviewing prosecutor may not gain actionable knowledge
that can be relied upon for decision making or acted upon for
further investigation. The prosecutor responds to the evi-
dence (s)he is made aware of by the FRPO's report.
It should not be assumed that reviewing prosecutors re-
investigate crimes, because generally they do not. When
prosecutors decide whether to file criminal charges, their pri-
mary source of information is the report written by the police
officer who investigated the crime (Hinds, 1993, p. 87; Levie
& Ballard, 1978, p. 13; Miller, 1993, pp. 1-2). This is verified
by Stanko (1981) who, as noted, witnessed hundreds of
prosecutorial reviews of presented police cases: Reports
were read, sometimes officers were interviewed, and then the
reviewing prosecutor filed or rejected a case. Since police
reports are generally not admissible into evidence due to
their hearsay nature (Fox, 2009; Giannelli, 2012; Grimm,
Deise, & Grimm, 2010), it may be their greatest contribution
to the prosecution of DV criminals is to persuade prosecutors
to file charges, and to memorialize evidence that prosecutors
can utilize during criminal proceedings.
Police Reports as Persuasive Argument
A police officer, in situ, gets a first and perhaps best look at
the evidence, and (s)he also gets the first opportunity to ques-
tion witnesses. If the officer concludes that a crime was com-
mitted, (s)he composes a written report in which (s)he strings
together a set of facts, telling a story of what (s)he believes
happened. It is not unreasonable, it is believed, to view the
police officer's report as a particular type of letter, written to
whomever the reviewing deputy prosecutor might be,
attempting to convince her/him that crime was committed,
and that charges should be filed. Due to the general inadmis-
sibility of police reports into courtroom evidence, it might be
more accurate to reconceptualize police reports as a persua-
sive argument made by the FRPO to the reviewing prosecu-
tor, outlining the merits of a criminal case.
Police Reports as a Data Warehouse
If a criminal complaint is filed, then the police report serves
as a data warehouse for prosecutors as they organize and
conduct a criminal case against the defendant(s). The report
lists contact information for witnesses, and it summarizes the
testimony they are likely to provide in the court. The former
fact helps prosecutors locate witnesses so they can be served
with subpoenas to testify, and the latter fact helps prosecutors
evaluate their potential usefulness to the prosecutorial effort.
The report describes evidence that was booked for safekeep-
ing, as well as evidence which may have been left behind
after being photographed.5 Descriptions of evidence helps
prosecutors evaluate its persuasive value, and also when and
how to use it. The police report can include spontaneous
statements such as "That'll teach him to keep his damn
mouth shut" or "Next time I'll kill the bitch." Spontaneous
statements can be strategically employed by prosecutors to
challenge the accuracy and truthfulness of testimony by the
individual who said them, if their courtroom testimony is
contradictory.6 Reports have other benefits as well.
Relying upon the content of the police report, and some-
times other factors, the reviewing prosecutor considers the
strength of the evidence, the general deterrence value a pros-
ecution would hold, and the government's enforcement pri-
orities (Weaver, Abramson, Burkoff, & Hancock, 2008).
Then, (s)he makes a decision about what to do.
Four Prosecutorial Options
The reviewing prosecutor selects one of four options. (S)he
can file charges and proceed with a criminal case, or perhaps
ask for additional investigation.7 The prosecutor may also
elect to place a first time offender in a program where, if (s)
he complete a series of requirements and also remains vio-
lence free for a year, charges will not be filed and thus a
criminal record will not be incurred (Garner & Maxwell,
2009; Visher, Harrell, Newmark, & Yahner, 2008; Weaver
et al., 2008). The final alternative is to reject the case alto-
gether, this being the fate of most baseline DV investigations
(Garner & Maxwell, 2009, Table 5).
If low rates of DV prosecution are unacceptable, and if
one wishes to investigate how rates of prosecution might be
raised such that more batterers are held accountable to crimi-
nal law for their actions, a good place to begin such an
inquiry would seem to be an examination of the stated rea-
sons for case rejection, as listed by reviewing prosecutors.

Reasons for Case Rejection
From a sparse literature, we learn that prosecutors reject
investigations for multiple specific reasons. Table 1 presents
seven of them, documented by the NIJ/Forst et al. study,
along with their frequencies of use (1982).
Though it might be reasonable to attribute some amount
of blame to police for evidence problems, witness problems,
and violations of due process, an unknown portion of blame
is undoubtedly due to factors beyond their control. Delving
into the genesis of case rejection, which is what the present
study does, can be tricky. One way to try to measure the
amount of prosecutorial potential under police control may
be to compare officers whose investigations are routinely
prosecuted with those who are routinely rejected. It is possi-
ble that these groups may differ on investigative methodol-
ogy, and perhaps, these differences may account for variance
in rates of prosecution. Only two studies have examined this
possibility.
Routine Investigative Insufficiency
A year-long study of N = 4,500 police officers at a large
municipal police agency, by the National Institute of Law
Enforcement and Criminal Justice (NILECJ; Forst et al.,
1977), showed that more than half of the criminal convictions
resulted from the work of just 8% of the officers, and that
more than half of all felony convictions were the work of
5.5% of the officers. Even more surprisingly, 46% of the offi-
cers did not make a single arrest over the course of the entire
year. Since about two thirds of the police officers at any
county or city police agency are assigned to patrol duties, the
remaining assignments--some of which may have lower
potential for making arrests--cannot explain these findings.8
The NILECJ findings were replicated by Forst et al.
(1982), who went further by distinguishing between two
groups of police officers. Ineffective officers stood around at
crime scenes "preserving the scene" and concluding "noth-
ing could be done"; whereas, high conviction rate officers
searched for evidence and witnesses. They were also
observed to more effectively interrogate suspects and adhere
to legalities of the investigative process, were more business-
like in their procedures, were more persistent, and were bet-
ter at establishing rapport with and trust of witnesses. Ewing
has described officers of this type as "super cops" (Forst
et al., 1977, pp. i-ii).
Purpose of the Study
Because the literature is silent on reasons why prosecutors
reject DV cases, the primary purpose of this work is to fill
that void. The second purpose is to assess the use of proba-
bility scores (P Scores) to quantitatively sort individual
police officers according to their routine use, or non-use, of
non-mandatory investigative techniques, drawing upon data
collected from each DV crime report they write. It is believed
that by separating officers according to their routine DV
investigative habits, we can begin to investigate the origins
of case rejection. Accordingly then, the third purpose is to
compare routinely lower effort (RLE) officers, as measured
by their lower use of the optional investigative techniques
(OITs; these are explained further in the "selection of vari-
ables" section), and routinely greater effort (RGE) officers,
who make greater use of the OITs, on rates of case rejection.
Doing this comparison may illuminate a relationship between
work habits and prosecution rates.
Criminology of the Study
The style and purpose of this study are intended to also serve
as an appeal to criminologists to re-think the current direc-
tion and practices of the discipline, and to serve as an exam-
ple of a problem-solving criminology (PSC) that responds to
deficiencies in the criminal justice system. Criminologists
themselves have identified two problems of great signifi-
cance with regard to the current practice of criminology:
Lack of impact upon public policy and lack of reach outside
of the discipline. As Currie (2007) describes,
Despite its accumulated theoretical and empirical heft, the
discipline of criminology has distressingly little impact on the
course of public policy toward crime and criminal justice . . .
significant changes (are needed) in the inner culture of the
discipline. (pp. 175, 176)
This lack of practical helpfulness might have its origins,
at least partially, in what seems to be an excessive and pre-
dominant focus upon theoretical explanations, and a search
for meaning regarding crime, the transmission and acquisi-
tion of criminal practice, differences in crime and victimiza-
tion rates between different groups, and so on. Though
meaning is illuminating, and the ability to predict

successfully is respectable, neither type of explanation
directly contributes useful methods for fixing current prob-
lems in the criminal justice system or society. Thus, PSC
incorporates, fundamentally in its conception and design, the
goal of using empirical methods to solve practical problems
and to impact public policy. However, even if problems are
solved, a second obstacle still exists, such that validated
solutions may remain hidden from the public and from crimi-
nal justice practitioners.
Chancer and McLaughlin (2007) describe the second
problem as follows:
Criminologists have had to confront the embarrassing fact that
in a society saturated with "crime talk," they have (the) utmost
difficulty in communicating with politicians, policy makers,
professionals and the public. (p. 157)
One reason may be that traditional criminology journals
tend to exist behind pay-walls, making them mostly inacces-
sible to criminal justice professionals. With download fees
from about US$25 to US$40,9 it is easy to see why chiefs of
police, police academy trainers, sergeants and lieutenants
and other police supervisors, prosecutors, judges, and so on
might not be able to access, and thus put to use findings from
the criminological study. However, there is a potential solu-
tion to this problem as well. In the last decade, a new type of
journal has been gaining steady traction among academics,
such that even major publishing houses are now offering
them: the peer-reviewed, open-access journal. In addition to
placing scholarly work in the hands of the public, for free, a
number of studies have shown that publishing in journals of
this type leads to greater citation of one's work (Antelman,
2004; Gargouri et al., 2010; Xia & Myers, 2011). However,
citation counts are of less importance to PSC, because they
are a measure of the use of one's material by fellow scholars.
PSC is primarily concerned about its availability to non-aca-
demic practitioners. Thus, a measure of greater importance
would be rates of download.As noted by Davis (2011), open-
access articles are downloaded significantly more often,
reaching a broader audience.
PSC, as it is proposed herein, responds to identified crimi-
nal justice shortcomings by employing the methods of crimi-
nology to seek empirically validated answers, and by making
those findings available to criminal justice practitioners by
presenting them in open-access journals. Undoubtedly, these
solutions will ruffle the feathers of a few traditionalists.
Doing so is not the intention of this work. It is hoped that
criminologists will maintain an open mind, and consider the
evidence and arguments in support of PSC. Just as the field
of physics contains theoretical and applied scholarship, so
also it is hoped and believed that the practice of criminology
is large enough to welcome another form of practice into this
important work. Like physics, where theoretical and applied
forms can both gain useful material from the work of the
other, so also it is believed that the phenomenological
descriptions, as well as the quantitative empirical work of
PSC, can provide much rich material for theoretical consid-
erations and proposition of meaning by others. And, con-
versely, prior traditional work is an excellent source to
consult when searching for prescient problems in the crimi-
nal justice system. It is believed that traditional criminolo-
gists should welcome the practice of PSC.
Changes in the manner of journal article production
are inevitable, when a substantially different paradigm
guides empirical work. That is true for PSC. Changes in
the presentation style will be most evident in the tail ends
of a scholarly paper. A review of the empirical and theo-
retical literature is replaced with an overview of the crim-
inal justice problem, and a survey of prior work that
frames it. The focus of the discussion section is re-pur-
posed into a forum where potential methods for criminal
justice practitioners to operationalize validated findings
are presented. What remains the same are the middle
parts: the empirical collection of quantitative data, and its
statistical analysis and presentation in tables and figures.
The present work is intended as an example of how PSC
can be put into practice.
Hypothesis
The null hypothesis of this study is that there are no differ-
ences between RLE and RGE officers on any of the prosecu-
torial outcomes. Two alternative hypotheses are considered.
The first is that rates of DV case rejection, by prosecutors,
will be significantly greater for RLE officers when compared
to their RGE counterparts. The second is that the rejected
investigations of RLE officers will sustain significantly more
criticism from reviewing prosecutors who reject their inves-
tigations, when compared to RGE officers.
Methodology
With permission, the author collected 16 types of data from
N = 1,810 DV investigations, those representing the total
number of DV crime allegations made by police, in the form
of a written report, for the entire year of 2007. An additional
242 types of data were collected on each of n = 366 randomly
selected investigations.10 The police agency where the study
was conducted employs several hundred officers and it
serves a mid-sized city in California. Access to archival data
was granted by the chief of police and also the District
Attorney. All cases were matched at the prosecutor's office
by using police case numbers. Because both offices use elec-
tronic records keeping, the problem of searching for paper
files was not encountered. Each investigation/case was
reviewed in detail, several times, over the course of 2.5 years,
and all data were coded by the author. Only the FRPO's writ-
ten report was used. The reason is because the interest of this
article is to assess the relationship between the work of
FRPO's and the outcome of criminal case filing. It is possible
Nelson 5
that other factors also have a bearing upon the decision to
prosecute, those being left to others to investigate.
Selection of Variables
Some components of a police report, when alleging a DV
crime, are mandatory and thus will show no variance.11 In
order to measure performance differences between officers,
one must therefore compare them on variables which are
optional, because those types of variables are under an indi-
vidual police officer's control, at least to the extent that a
given circumstance will permit their use. In addition, it
would seem important to select variables that are relevant to
the criminal justice process and specifically to DV crime. Six
explanatory variables fitting these requirements were
selected for the study. Each has been shown to significantly
increase the odds of prosecution for DV crime. They are as
follows: obtain an emergency protective order (EPO) 87%,
obtain photographs 60%, locate additional witnesses 68%,
find and arrest the suspect 94%, and list more than one crimi-
nal charge 284%. Survival analysis demonstrates that the
slope for a sixth action, completing the written report the
same day, is almost vertical at the onset, and it rapidly
decreases after just a few days following the investigation,
meaning if charges are to be filed the police officers report
must reach the prosecutor's office without delay (Nelson,
2013). In addition, 13 dichotomous outcomes were mea-
sured. The first is whether or not the prosecutor filed crimi-
nal charges, for a given investigation. The remainder are the
12 standardized reasons that prosecutors select to character-
ize a rejected investigation, and whether they were used.12
Calculation of Proficiency Scores
Proficiency scores (P Scores)13 were calculated for each
police report in the random sample by assigning a whole
number value of one (1) to each positive occurrence of an
OIT, with one exception. A value of one (1) was added for
each crime code listed in the police report. Doing so gives
that variable additional weight, which seems reasonable in
light of the fact that, as noted, the number of charges has
significantly more influence upon the odds of prosecution.
Because at least one crime is always listed in a police report,
the range of P Scores is 1. Table 2 lists an example of how
P Scores are calculated using raw data from two police offi-
cers, each of whom had n = 4 investigations.
Segregation of Cases
Officers with 3 investigations within the random sample
were segregated for a further study (n = 49). Under ideal cir-
cumstances, the selection threshold would be higher than
three cases; however, the diminished group size which natu-
rally attends random selection limits access to larger amounts
of any individual's work. P Scores were determined for each
investigation, and from those, average P Score and standard
deviation (sd) values were calculated for each officer.
If one assumes that average sd is, per officer, a direct mea-
sure of habit, with small sd indicating closely followed rou-
tines, then one can use an officer's average sd as a sorting
criteria. Among the segregated officers, average sd ranged
from 0.52 to 3.61 (mean = 1.57, sd = .68), and P Scores
ranged from 2.67 to 5.29 (mean = 4.09, sd = 1.57). Among
those, n = 37 officers had an average sd <2.00 (mean
sd = 1.35). Those officer were partitioned according to indi-
vidual average P Scores, with n = 9 landing in the high
P Score range, those officers demonstrating routine greater
effort; n = 19 in the middle; and n = 10 in the low P Score
range, those officers demonstrating routine lower effort. The
mean sd of the excluded group is 2.38.
Comparison of Measures
Comparison of means and ratios was conducted using one-
tail z tests. The z test is the appropriate choice because only
two means or two ratios are compared at a time, and because

Limitations
This is a study of one police agency and one prosecutor's
office in California. It is likely that there are procedural dif-
ferences in other locations; thus, generalizability may be
diminished to an unknown extent. However, fundamental
techniques for investigating, documenting, and proving DV
crime in the United States are contained within bounds estab-
lished by Constitutional law and also U.S. Supreme Court
decisions; and so, it is felt that regional differences will not
be large.Also, officers in the present study were not tested on
their knowledge of law and procedure, and more specifically
attitudes, motivations, and narratives regarding why RLE
officers choose to investigate DV crime less thoroughly, and
why RGE officers choose to routinely operationalize the
OITs with significantly greater frequency.
Results
Of the 366 investigations submitted to the prosecutor, 48%
were rejected (n = 178). Written reasons for case rejection
were provided 93% of the time (165/178), with prosecutors
choosing one or more reasons from the standardized list con-
taining 12 categories. An average of 3.01 reasons were listed
per rejected investigation (sd = 1.84). Table 3 identifies the
reasons along with their frequency of use.
As seen, two thirds of the investigations are labeled "no
case"--which is, essentially, the twin to Stanko's "garbage
case." In the prosecutor's office under study, the "no case"
designation is the "kiss of death," meaning, the police depart-
ment should not re-investigate and re-submit the case. It has
been permanently rejected.14 The frequency of "no case"
rejections illuminates why police officers should be investi-
gatively thorough the first time--odds are, there will not be
a second chance to get it right.
Slightly more than 50% of the investigations were
described as having insufficient evidence. This designation
does not mean that a crime did not occur, it just means that
there was not enough evidence to prove it happened in a
criminal trial.15 These findings indicate that prosecutors want
more evidence, more independent witnesses, and more thor-
ough investigations than they are routinely getting from the
police. Table 4 compares RLE and RGE officers on rates of
case rejection.
As the data in Table 4 demonstrate, the rate of case rejec-
tion for RLE officers is about three magnitudes greater com-
pared to their RGE counterparts16; therefore, the first
hypothesis is accepted. In addition, as seen, RLE officers
sustain significantly more criticism from reviewing prosecu-
tors compared to RGE officers; therefore, the second hypoth-
esis is accepted as well. In light of the vast difference between
RLE and RGE officers on rates of case rejection, the results
displayed in Table 5 are not surprising. They are ranked
according to the frequency as it applies to RLE officers.
As the data demonstrate, there are significant differences
in 7 of the 10 case rejection reasons actually used by prose-
cutors. The rejected investigations of RLE officers are seen
as having a low likelihood of conviction, insufficient or
ambiguous evidence, no witnesses, and possibly represent-
ing acts of self-defense. In two categories, RLE and RGE
officer scores are the same, those being further investigation
needed, and deminimus conduct.17 Only one case rejection
reason was directed toward RGE officer investigations more
often, which being dismissed without a reason being given.
Sometimes that is done to join the charge to another case,
and sometimes it is done because a first time offender agrees
to a diversion program. There can be other reasons as well.
Discussion
As the results demonstrate, prosecutors want understandable
reports with sufficient evidence, witnesses, and charges.
When they do not get what they need, which is what happens
with most reports written by RLE officers, DV investigations
Nelson 7
are rejected. This is not a new finding. The NILECJ in 1974,
Elizabeth Stanko in 1981, and the NIJ/Forst et al. study in
1982 all described the devastating effect of low effort offi-
cers upon the likelihood of prosecution; yet, almost four
decades later little has changed, at least in regard to rates of
DV crime prosecution. Perhaps this is because, until now,
there has not existed a means by which each DV investiga-
tion and each police officer could be quantitatively scored
and subjected to trend analysis. This article aims to correct
that deficiency by equipping police supervisors, and others
professionals, with the means to do so.
One might suspect that additional training of police is
called for; however, there are at least four reasons that sug-
gest that police officers, at least in California and probably
elsewhere in the Western world, are already sufficiently
trained and experienced in the operationalization of each of
the six OITs. First, police officers are trained in the specifics
of DV investigation, while they are in the police academy. In
California, police recruits are trained on 21 topics related to
DV crime investigation, those being explained in a 151-page
training manual (California Commission on Police Officer
Standards & Training [POST], 2006).18 The training manual
is supplemented by a 29-page field investigation guide that
officers can consult when organizing a DV investigation
(POST, 2004).
Second, rookie police officers cannot matriculate out of
field training, until they have repeatedly and sufficiently
demonstrated their ability to operationalize hundreds of
police skills, including the six OITs. 19Requirements such as
these are seen in other states as well (Haarr, 2005; Sun,
2003a, 2003b). Third, in California and many places, police
officers must undergo regularly scheduled refresher training
on DV investigation techniques. In California it is every 2
years, with 17 mandated teaching points being required by
law (California Penal Code §13519).20
Finally, RLE and RGE officers do not operate in differ-
ent spheres; probability theory insures that their work over-
laps regularly. In the case of DV crime, it can be inferred
that RLE officers are regularly exposed to the more thor-
ough investigative methods of RGE officers. We know this
to be likely for at least two reasons. Because of the risk of
injury when responding to DV crime, it is routine police
practice to have two or more officers approach the scene
together (Hirschel, Dean, & Lumb, 1994; Meyer & Carroll,
2011; POST, 2001). Thus, RLE officers will sometimes
provide protection for RGE officers assigned to investigate
a particular DV crime, and vice versa. Doing so places RLE
officers in a position to observe the investigative method of
RGE officers. Also, the amount of exposure would be even
greater when RLE and RGE officers are paired up as a
patrol team, circumstances where each type of officer
would have ample opportunity to observe the work habits
of the other.
The assertion of global investigative competency chal-
lenges the position that additional training may be needed,
instead suggesting what is actually needed is a means by
which RLE officers--who know how to investigate DV
crime thoroughly--can be compelled to do so. The global
argument contends: Every police officer knows how to
search for, locate, and interview witnesses. Finding wit-
nesses is something police officers do across a wide variety
of crimes, on a daily basis. So also, every police officer
knows how to obtain photographs; make a detailed search for
evidence; call a judge to seek an EPO; and search for and
find a suspect for the purposes of obtaining a statement, serv-
ing an EPO, or to make an arrest. Every police officer knows
how to ask detailed questions if they want to, of the type
which will elicit important details not only about the present
crime(s) but also those in the recent past that are still
chargeable.
If the assertion of global investigative competency is
correct, and at least in California the level of initial, field,
and follow-up training suggests the supposition may be
true, then so long as one assumes random distribution of
investigative potential--that is, RLE officers are con-
fronted with an equal amount of potential to operationalize
the OITs as are RGE officers--then there seems to be no
other testable explanation for why RLE officers operation-
alize the OITs significantly less often, other than by indi-
vidual choice.
There is some evidence in the literature as to the origins
of low effort policing. The problem can be seen as not only
endemic to a subset of police officers but also to entire
police agencies. A 2005 report by the California State
Attorney General's office describes how some police orga-
nizations are known, with regard to DV, to produce "inade-
quate investigations."

8 SAGE Open
More than half of the District Attorney's Offices . . . and two
City Attorney's Offices explained that there was great variation
in the quality of [domestic violence] reports submitted--from
inadequate to excellent--depending on which law enforcement
agency did the investigation. [Some] of these District Attorney's
Offices stated that they will reject a case, rather than request
further investigation, if the initial report is inadequate and comes
fromanagencygenerallythoughttodoinadequateinvestigations.
(California State Attorney General, 2005, p. 54)
If the findings of Stanko, the NILECJ, and the NIJ/Forst
et al. are to be believed, minimal effort officers may consti-
tute a substantial portion of the total number of police per-
sonnel, and if the California State Attorney General is to be
believed, the problem is not only individual but also sys-
temic. Thus, resistance to change--that being a mandate to
always investigate every DV crime thoroughly--may exist
at both the individual and organizational levels. Psychologists
have amply documented at the individual level, and sociolo-
gists, economists, political scientists, and anthropologists
have documented at the group level how challenging it is to
effect permanent change of behavior. Thus, to solve the
problem of low effort policing of DV crime, much difficult
work may lay ahead.
Early criticism of this article suggested that it may not be
appropriate to engage in a corrective discussion of this type:
One that recommends specific changes to the methodology
of individual police officers and also entire police organiza-
tions. The stated reason was because such a call for change
broadens the discussion beyond the scope of the empirical
findings presented in this article. In a traditional journal form
that would probably be appropriate advice. However, as
noted in the "Criminology of the Study" section (above), the
present work is organized on the practice of a problem-solv-
ing criminology. The key nature of problem solving is to try
to identify the genesis of a targeted problem, in this case the
relationship between low effort policing and low rates of
prosecution of DV crime, and then to propose solutions to
the problem. Thus, it is essential to present potential solu-
tions in this portion of the article.
One solution to the problem of low effort policing will
undoubtedly be the creation of feedback systems which
inform street-level police officers about the mistakes and
insufficiencies of their work, as seen by reviewing prosecu-
tors. In the city of the present study, no such system existed
at the time of data collection. The same is true in many other
locales (Forst et al., 1982, p. 34), though some jurisdictions
have established prosecutor to police officer feedback sys-
tems (Smith, Davis, Nickles, & Davies, 2001).
The National District Attorneys Association is aware of
the problem of low feedback. Highlighting the importance of
prosecutorial input to police officers, the organization has
stated "The prosecutor has a large stake in the training and
professionalization of local law enforcement. Its handling of
a case is often crucial to the prosecutor's success" (National
District Attorneys Association [NDAA], 2009, p. 23). To
help remedy the problem, the NDAA recommends the fol-
lowing actions for prosecutors (2009, p. 22):
1. Seek to actively improve communication between
prosecutors and law enforcement.
2. Implement a communication system which keeps
police officers informed about cases they
investigated.
3. Assist in the training of police officers.
4. Periodically provide briefings for police officers on
recent court decisions, legislation, and changes in the
rules of criminal procedure.
5. Request that each law enforcement agency establish
a liaison with their office.
6. Advise police agencies on investigative policies
which will withstand later judicial inquiry.
Ease of Implementation
To summarize, there are three potential solutions that may
help to significantly and substantially increase rates of DV
prosecution, actionable items that can be operationalized
without delay--it should not be difficult to implement any of
them. The first is to compel FRPOs to fully operationalize
the best practices method for the investigation of DV crime,
because doing so has been shown to substantially and signifi-
cantly raise those rates (Nelson, 2013). Second, police agen-
cies should use the P Score method to monitor the routine
work habits of their police officers, with regard to DV crime
investigation. Finally, the NDAA's system of prosecutorial
feedback--which is, in essence, a system of teaching--can
help officers advance their investigative skills by telling
them, in writing, what they are doing right, what they are
doing wrong, and what is missing altogether. Taken together,
it is believed and predicted that implementation of these
three systems should substantially and permanently increase
rates of DV prosecution and conviction, in jurisdictions
where they are imposed.
At the officer level, the only equipment that is required to
thoroughly investigate DV crime is a pencil and notebook,
some paper bags in which to collect evidence and a camera.
At the supervisorial level, the only equipment that is needed
to track P Scores is a notebook or a spreadsheet, and possibly
a calculator. At the prosecutorial level, all that is required for
feedback is the means to write a message to an officer, such
as by email. These are not burdensome methods to imple-
ment; so, arguments of expense and training are seen as
unpersuasive. Religion, culture, political power, and indi-
vidual habit are more likely to be the actual obstacles that
could prevent full adoption of this program.
The use of P Scores is not limited to police supervisors.
Victims and advocates may find the method to be useful
when evaluating the content of a given police report for
Nelson 9
sufficiency. Police oversight bodies, including Attorney's
general and state departments of justice, can use aggregated
P Scores to evaluate the response to DV by agencies they
monitor. Government or private sources of grants can use
P Scores as a means to assess change in the way a police
agency responds to DV crime. Researchers can use the
method for both within and between assessments of police
agencies. Police academy instructors can use the method
when grading cadets as they engage DV training scenarios,
or when they participate in written examinations. Also, the
P Score method is not limited to American style policing, or
just to DV crime. Once the validity of additional explanatory
measures is established, the method could be adjusted to fit
other types of crimes and other types of legal systems as
well.
Recommendations
Police agencies and political leaders are encouraged to con-
sider mandating the use of the best practices model for DV
investigation. It is possible that individual officers may not
realize how significantly the OITs impact prosecution rates;
and so, they should be informed about how important usage
of those investigative techniques is to a case. Thereafter, offi-
cers should be required to document, each time they investi-
gate DV crime, how they attempted to operationalize each of
the six OITs. Police agencies should be encouraged to adopt
P Score monitoring of officers. Minimalist officers identified
by low aggregated P Scores should be counseled to increase
their use of the OITs, and then monitored for compliance. It
is felt that those who are unwilling or unable to do so should
be, after sufficient warning, discharged from police service
as unfit.
There is a historical reason to believe that implementation
of these recommendations may produce a substantial and
lasting increase in the rates of DV prosecution. When DV
arrest was mandated by some states, and strongly encour-
aged by others, what followed was a permanent increase in
the rates of DV prosecution for those cases that included an
arrest (Garner & Maxwell, 2009, Table 5).

Notes
1. Stanko's earlier work was in Massachusetts, and her later
observations were in London.
2. Thirty-five percent of the arrests were prosecuted. Of those,
24% ended with a guilty plea. (.35)(.24)(100) = 8.4%. Note
that the authors did not report the final figure in their article;
however, it is calculated using their data.
 3. Data from two different years, 1974 and 1977, were used from
a single location--Washington, D.C. The other locations were
Cobb Co., Georgia, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Manhattan,
New Orleans, and Salt Lake City.
4. These results were calculated using the data reported in the
National Institute of Justice/Forst et al. study.
 5. Some evidence is difficult to collect, for example, a message
scrawled upon a wall. In order to collect that evidence, one
would be required to cut out that section of the wall, pack-
age it, and then book it into the agency's evidence room. That
is a burdensome and destructive proposition. Or, suppose the
evidence are bruise marks, one cannot preserve an arm just for
its evidentiary value. Thus, for some types of evidence, police
officers can only photograph it, but cannot collect it.
 6. Unlike ordinary statements, in the United States spontaneous
statements are generally admissible in the court, and they can
be damning to a defendant or to the witness who said them
(United States Supreme Court, Michigan v. Bryant, 2011).
7. Perhaps, the prosecutor might have noticed something in a
photograph and wants it looked into, or maybe (s)he wants
children interviewed, and so on.
 8. This can be confirmed by reviewing organizational charts of
municipal and county police agencies.
9. On February 28, 2013, using Google Scholar to search on
"domestic violence (DV)" "police" "investigation" for the
period 2005-2013 returned 27,800 hits. The first three non-
book links were opened. A 2005 article by Felson and Pare in
Journal of Marriage and Family [67(3):597-610] was unavail-
able and offered no means for purchase unless one registers
with Wiley online, and also purchases a day use pass. The
price of the article could not be determined without register-
ing, which was not done. A 2006 article by Dunford, Huizinga,
and Elliot in Criminology [28(2):183-206] met with the same
result; that journal also being owned by Wiley. The third, a
2005 article by Fugate, Landis, Riordan, Naureckas, and Engel
in Violence Against Women [11(3):29-310] was also unavail-
able; however, a cost of $25 was indicated on the re-directed
page, along with a link to make the purchase. To get a sense of
the range of fees, a number of additional journal articles were
checked, across four major journal publishing houses. A fee of
$25 was seen consistently; however, one SpringerLink article
was $40 (Seelau and Seelau, 2005, Journal of Family Violence
[2005, 20(6):363-371]). Some articles that were identified by
Google Scholar had broken links; thus, it was not possible to
go to the purchase page even with repeated effort.
10. These data are constituents of a comprehensive study across
many aspects of the criminal justice response to DV crime.
They are being reported across a series of papers, each devoted
to a different aspect of the criminal justice response. The best
practices method for the investigation of DV is detailed in
(Nelson, 2013). Other forthcoming papers in this series address
10 SAGE Open
over- and under-reporting of DV crime by first responding
police officers (FRPOs); means by which individual officers,
and also police agencies as a whole subvert prosecution of DV
crime; a detailed examination of post-conviction DV sentenc-
ing; and a model for quantitative monitoring of FRPOs for DV
investigative sufficiency.
11. Always, at a minimum, an officer must identify a victim, iden-
tify a suspect, establish that they have a qualifying "domestic"
relationship, and (s)he must describe how all of the elements
of at least one DV crime were fulfilled by the actions of the
suspect. If any of these components are missing, the crime
report is incomplete, and therefore a criminal case cannot be
prosecuted.
12. An assumption of a causal relationship between FRPO inves-
tigative actions and later prosecutorial outcomes is made.
Parsimonious logic, it is believed, favors this assumption.
The actions of police always precede the actions of prosecu-
tors; whereas the opposite is never true. Prosecutors do not
come to the scene of a DV crime and advise police officers
how to perform their job. Police and prosecutors are separated
by time, location, agency, and the organizational structure
of two bureaucracies. Thus, the assumption of causal influ-
ence of police-associated explanatory variables, such as the
six optional investigative techniques, seems to be adequately
justified by the unidirectional and relatively isolated nature
of the relationship between police and prosecutor during the
period when the FRPO is on the scene, investigating a DV
crime.

14. The reason "Rejected, do not resubmit" seems to be reserved
for use when a previously rejected police investigation is re-
worked and re-submitted, and for a second time it is rejected
by prosecutors.
15. Recognizing that police can face lawsuit for making up facts
and falsely accusing people of crime, and they may also
face criminal prosecution for doing so, the assumption that
most rejected investigations represent bone fide DV crime is
believed to be reasonable. In support, we see that the Type I
error rate for felony convictions in the United States is quite
low, ranging from 0.5% to 3% (Zalman, 2011; Zalman, Smith,
& Kiger, 2008).
16. ((18/37) / (7/39)) × 102 = 271%
17. Deminimus conduct means the facts as described do not suf-
ficiently meet the definition of a crime. For example, throwing
a wadded up piece of paper at one's romantic or sexual partner,
even though it may strike his/her, and even though it may have
been done in anger, probably does not constitute battery.
18. These topics include defining domestic violence, willful inflic-
tion of corporal injury, criminal threats, stalking, malicious
destruction of telephone or electrical lines, battery, spousal
rape, batterer and victim characteristics, response procedures,
arrest, identifying evidence, victim protection, types of court
orders, victim services, and so forth (California Commission
on Police Officer Standards & Training [POST], 2006).
19. In California, the Commission on Police Officer Standards and
Training establishes and regulates all police training require-
ments. The following link goes to the webpage that contains
the details regarding the field training of rookie police officers:
http://www.post.ca.gov/field-training-program-guide.aspx.
20. These include the duty to respond in a timely manner, the
circumstances under which to make an arrest, the nature and
extent of DV, signs of DV, rights of the victim, investigation
and documentation, evidence collection, report writing, the
impact on children, and so forth.
