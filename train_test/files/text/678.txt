UNIVERSAL COVERAGE:
BUILDING ON
MEDICARE AND
EMPLOYER FINANCING
by Karen Davis and Cathy Schoen
Prologue: Ever since World War II the United States has re-
lied on an employer-based system of health insurance coverage.
Although a majority of workers still rely on employer-based in-
surance, a structural shift away from large-employer, capital-
intensive industries to labor-intensive, smaller employers that
provide a service is eroding this coverage. In this paper two
economists--Karen Davis, executive vice-president of The
Commonwealth Fund, and Cathy Schoen, an associate profes-
sor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst--discuss ac-
tual legislative proposals that policymakers have introduced to
achieve broader insurance coverage. As they point out, there
are a limited number of ways to finance universal coverage:
employer premiums, individual premiums, tax mandates, or
some combination of the three. To make coverage universal,
they urge consideration of an expansion of Medicare, whatever
the mix offinancing. This approach is consistent with that being
pursued by Rep. Pete Stark (D-CA), chairman of the House
Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. Unlike many pol-
icy analysts, Davis and Schoen do not subscribe to the view that
a government mandate requiring employers to provide insur-
ance to their workers would necessarily lead to a dollar-for-
dollar reduction in wages of uninsured workers. Some of the
costs may be covered by an increase in prices to all consumers.
Davis, who holds a doctorate in economics from Rice Univer-
sity, was a key figure in the development of the Carter admini-
stration's national health insurance plan. Later she became
chair of the Department of Health Policy and Management at
The Johns Hopkins University. Schoen directs the Common-
wealth Health Care Reform Program, which is based at the
University of Massachusetts. Previously, she headed the Re-
search and Policy Department at the Service Employees Inter-
national Union.

Abstract: Universal coverage requires a strategy to sever the link between insurance coverage and
employment in order to build a more stable insurance base. Universality also will require subsidies to
make coverage affordable. Given these realities, the authors evaluate different financing proposals--
employer and individual premium mandates and taxes--in terms of equity, affordability, and admin-
istrative and political criteria. An expansion of Medicare offers an insurance alternative that takes
advantage of existing administrative structures of national scope.
The debate on how to finance universal coverage depends critically
on acknowledging that universality requires mandated financing. If
one accepts universal coverage, the issue is not mandates but how to
share the financing burden between employers and individuals and whether
premiums (flat contributions) or taxes (income-related contributions)
should be the primary financing mechanism. Criteria for evaluating alterna-
tive schemes are essential to weigh the relative merits of different financing
mixes and the transition issues that would result. Whatever the theoretical
merits of different approaches in a historical vacuum, we must move from
our current complex mix of tax, individual, and employer financing to a new
mix that covers everyone.
Any thoughtful analysis of today's U.S. industry and job structure must
conclude that we are in the midst of a steady erosion of voluntary employer-
based health insurance coverage, the foundation for insuring Americans
under age sixty-five.1 To reverse this erosion, mandates are needed to
ensure universal coverage. At the same time, mandates must include subsi-
dies to make insurance affordable and must address a changing employment
structure that makes employment a less and less viable foundation for
providing insurance, whatever the mix of financing.
Affordability. In 1992, 38.5 million people--one in seven--had no
health insurance at any point in time, two million more than in 1991.2 A
survey by The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and The Commonwealth
Fund in August 1993 found that only 7 percent of the uninsured are
uninsured by choice. The main reason is that uninsured people either
cannot afford coverage or have an employer that does not pay for coverage.3
The income distribution of the uninsured underscores the need for
subsidies or income-related financing to achieve universality. Nearly two-
thirds of the uninsured live at or near poverty.4 With incomes of $24,000 or
less, these are families who simply cannot afford family premiums, which
today average more than $5,000 a year. We must either require employers
to bear a portion of this cost, provide tax-financed subsidies, or use tax-like
contributions linked to ability to pay to make coverage affordable.
The attraction of extending employment-based financing grows out of
the fact that most of the twenty-three million low-income uninsured per-
sons work. Altogether, 84 percent of the uninsured live in families headed
by either full- or part-time workers.5

ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL COVERAGE 9
Changing structure of work. Although employment remains the pillar
on which health insurance coverage in the United States is based, struc-
tural changes undermine the viability of employment as a foundation for
the future, whatever the decisions on financing. Three structural changes
are particularly relevant: the shift in the employment base away from
large-employer, capital-intensive industries toward small-employer, labor-
intensive industries; the rapid increase in the proportion of "contingent
jobs" that are part time, temporary, and contracted rather than full time,
year-round for a single employer; and high rates of turnover in the job
market as people change jobs more rapidly than in the past.
The shift to labor-intensive, small-employer service industries erodes
voluntarily provided, employment-based health insurance.6 It is not surpris-
ing that about 30 percent of the uninsured work for firms with fewer than
ten employees, and 31 percent work for firms with ten to ninety-nine
employees.7 For small employers, health benefit costs tend to be high
relative to labor and overall costs, and the task of administering a health
benefit program is cumbersome at best.
For the 30 percent of all working Americans that make up the contin-
gent work force of part-time, temporary, and independent contractor work-
ers, no natural, stable employment group exists for insurance purposes.8
Rapid technological change has added to job instability for the full-time
work force as well. One in ten Americans reportedly are now switching jobs
or are without a job for at least some period of each year. People increas-
ingly move in and out of temporary jobs.
The willingness of employers with more stable, full-time work forces to
provide and pay for family coverage has partially offset and hidden the
impact of these structural changes. People in jobs that do not offer health
insurance often can enroll as dependents in their spouse's employer plan.
This voluntary social commitment by larger employers to pool costs of
family coverage is already eroding. Given these structural changes, financ-
ing strategies must consider how to sever the link between employment
status and insurance coverage while mandating universality.
Financing Criteria: Evaluating The Alternatives
To evaluate the choices for mandating and financing universal coverage,
we must identify values or criteria with which to judge their relative merits.
At least six economic criteria and two political concerns apply: ( 1 ) Equity:
Families with similar incomes should pay similar costs, and all firms in the
same financial condition should make the same contribution (horizontal
equity). (2) Financial burden: The full cost of health care premiums is now
beyond the means of many families. Payments should be related to ability to

pay (vertical equity). (3) Fiscal soundness: Premiums or tax rates should be
sufficient to cover the cost of coverage. (4) Efficiency and employment:
Financing should minimize employment impacts of higher labor costs and
high marginal tax rates. (5) Continuity and stability of health insurance:
Financing policies should assure continuous, stable coverage as people age
or change various aspects of their family and work lives. (6) Administrative
simplicity, efficiency, and enforceability: Administrative expenses should
be minimized, and mechanisms should be adequate for collecting the nec-
essary funds. (7) Political support of the insured: The design and explana-
tion of the policies should garner support from both the insured and the
uninsured. (8) Federal budget costs and taxes: If taxes are to be a source of
financing, alone or combined with mandatory premiums, we must address
the misperception that they will necessarily increase payments by families.
Mandates: Evaluating Basic Choices
Mandates to require and pay for universal coverage can be achieved in
three ways: employer premiums and individual premiums (fixed contribu-
tions per person or family) and tax mandates (income-related contribu-
tions).9 The U.S. health system now relies on a mix of all three, plus direct
patient payments to finance care. The question is how to use mandates to
shift and augment this mix to build a base for stable, universal coverage.
Any choice has advantages and disadvantages that become more or less
important depending on the overall approach to reform and on which
values are dominant. The policy challenge is to choose the mix that best
meets basic social criteria while addressing transitional concerns, including
perceptions about who is now paying the costs of care.
In evaluating strategies, we also must examine specific proposals rather
than more abstract constructs. While in theory the same distributional
outcome might be achieved by varying mixes of mandates and subsidies,
proposals before Congress differ widely in distributional outcomes as well as
in mandate strategies.
On close inspection, those national proposals that require mandates are
generally mixed financing approaches, whatever the labels. For example,
President Bill Clinton's Health Security Act would mandate employer
payments of up to 80 percent of premiums for full-time workers and partial
premium contributions for part-time workers. By capping employer premi-
ums as a percentage of payroll ranging from 3.5 percent to 7.9 percent for
firms with fewer than 5,000 employees, the proposal effectively converts
the flat mandatory per person premium into a payroll-related "tax" up to an
earnings threshold. Moreover, the Clinton plan would require families to
pay a share of the premium directly, with subsidies related to income to ease

ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL COVERAGE 11
the financial burden. Under the Clinton proposal, income-related caps
effectively convert the individual premium mandate to an income-related
"tax" up to the income threshold for subsidies, after which mandates revert
to a flat premium or head tax.10
Similarly, proposals with individual premium mandates depend on a
mixed approach. For example, Sen. John Chafee's (R-RI) Health Equity
and Access Reform Today proposal would mandate individual purchase of
health insurance, with sliding-scale subsidies up to 240 percent of the
federal poverty level.11 A family of three earning $28,500 (240 percent of
poverty) would pay 13.3 percent of income for the premium. The plan also
implicitly relies on employers to maintain existing levels of premium fi-
nancing. It would finance subsidies from cuts in Medicare and Medicaid,
effectively using federal and state general tax revenues to cover the unin-
sured. To be fiscally sound, the plan might require new general tax revenues
to achieve guaranteed coverage at proposed subsidy levels.12
Employer-Mandated Premiums
While an employer-mandated premium could be designed in many ways,
the following discussion assumes that employers would be required to pay
80 percent of premiums for full-time workers and a partial contribution for
part-time workers, and that subsidies would be available to employers to
offset a portion of health benefit costs that exceed a given percentage of
payroll. It is important to distinguish employer-financed health insurance
from employer-provided health insurance. In the Clinton plan, for exam-
ple, employers with fewer than 5,000 employees would contribute to cover-
age for workers, but coverage would be provided through health alliances.
A worker's coverage, therefore, would not necessarily change when he or
she changed jobs; only the source of financing for that coverage would
change. Plans that mandate both employer premiums and employer provi-
sion of coverage would inevitably entail considerable instability and turn-
over of coverage--as workers change jobs, become unemployed, or shift
from full-time work to the contingent labor force.
New federal budget costs minimized. Perhaps the single greatest ad-
vantage of employer premium mandates is that they minimize the extent to
which new federal budget costs and explicit taxes are necessary to achieve
universality. By retaining and building on the $200 billion already spent by
employers to pay health care premiums for employees and retirees, man-
dated employer premium contributions reduce the level of direct public
subsidies required for low-income uninsured families. Government subsi-
dies to individuals could be largely targeted to low-income nonworking
families. Subsidies to employers to offset a portion of their costs would, of

12 HEALTH AFFAIRS | Spring (II) 1994
course, increase total governmental costs. However, it is likely to cost the
government less to subsidize nonworking low-income families and target
partial employer/employee subsidies to working low-income families than
to subsidize premiums directly for all low- and middle-income families.
Other distributional impacts moderated. By building on the current
employer-paid financing base, employer premium mandates moderate
swings in the distribution of financing when compared with mandates
financed entirely by payroll, income, or other taxes. The major changes are
for firms that do not now provide health benefits. According to estimates
from Lewin-VHI, 21 percent of firms that now provide some insurance for
their workers would see their costs go up more than $1,000 per worker.13
Costs would go down in firms that now cover workers and their working
spouses, as spouses would obtain coverage from their own employers.
Improved horizontal equity. An employer premium mandate improves
horizontal equity by requiring all firms in a similar situation to pay similar
costs. Complex cross-subsidies across employers now encourage firms to
seek a competitive advantage by shifting the costs of health benefits onto
other employers without a compensating increase in wages or other bene-
fits. A firm that provides health benefits often finds itself competing with a
firm that does not. While economic theory may argue that noninsuring
firms would have to provide compensatory higher wages to attract and
retain workers, labor markets rarely work so perfectly in practice.
If combined with community rating, employer premium mandates would
ensure that firms in the same industry or area would play on a more level
field. Variations in the age and health status of covered workers and
dependents can result in different costs of fringe benefits for firms in the
same industry that do not reflect productivity differences. For example, a
new Japanese auto plant in the United States may have more single,
younger, healthier workers than does an existing U.S. plant and thus may
face lower labor costs although paying the same wages. Employer mandates
(especially when combined with community rating and pooling across a
large population base) redistribute costs and, in effect, establish a new
minimum labor cost for jobs throughout the economy based on the mini-
mum wages plus health premiums per hour worked.
Lighter fiscal burden on working families. Employer premium man-
dates can increase the affordability of health insurance for low-income
workers and their families while reducing the need for additional govern-
mental subsidies. Simply put, requiring a currently uninsured family (with
children) earning $20,000 to pay 20 percent of a $5,000 premium, or
$1,000 (5 percent of income), imposes a lighter financial burden than
requiring the same family to pay the full $5,000 premium (25 percent of
income).

ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL COVERAGE 13
Again, true believers in perfect labor markets may argue that the em-
ployer will pay the worker $4,000 less under the employer mandate so that
the cost to the worker is $5,000 in either case. However, employers may
choose simply to pass the cost on to consumers in the form of higher prices
(especially if all firms in the industry are under the same requirement).
While economists note that in that case workers as a whole still would pay
through lower real wages, it makes a great deal of difference whether all
consumers bear part of the cost or whether costs are borne solely by workers
of uninsured firms. Empirical evidence on whether health costs are shifted
forward to consumers or backward to workers is largely inconclusive.
Even if employers trade off wages and health benefits, the costs may be
spread across their work force. For example, if two workers are doing the
same job, would the employer pay the worker who has a family health
insurance policy less than the worker with an individual policy, or more to
the younger worker than to the older one to compensate for the difference
in their premium costs? Even if employers shift health benefit costs back to
workers, those costs may be pooled and distributed across the entire work
force, including shifting more of the costs to higher-wage workers.
The struggle by workers to keep employer-paid health coverage is driven
in part by the fact that health benefits are one of the few fringe benefits
provided equally, regardless of income. Unlike pensions or life insurance,
the value of health benefits does not rise with wages. Thus, the $20,000-a-
year line worker typically receives the same health benefits as the $100,000-
a-year vice-president. Middle- and low-income employees do not believe
that employers would voluntarily give workers at all wage levels a uniform
raise of, say, $4,000 a year if they no longer had to provide health benefits.
Similarly, employers' opposition to required employer premium pay-
ments reflects an employer/employee consensus that the financial burden
differs when employers rather than employees are required to pay premi-
ums. Although over the long term employer-paid premium costs may re-
duce total wage income in the economy through the impact of higher prices
or reduced wage increases overall, this impact is unlikely to be distributed
dollar for dollar per employee based on that employee's health cost. For
workers at or near the minimum wage, in particular, employers are unable
to reduce wages if health costs increase. Thus, employer premium mandates
are likely to lower the financial burden for low-income-worker families
without an offsetting equal reduction in their earnings.
Administrative enforceability and efficiency. Employer premium
mandates could rely on the same enforcement mechanisms as Social Secu-
rity payroll taxes do now. Compared with individual premium mandate
approaches that would require large payments from low- and middle-in-
come families, such mechanisms are likely to be relatively easy to enforce

and to produce more reliable and stable sources of financing.
Adverse employment effects. The principal disadvantage of employer
premium mandates is the possible adverse impact on low-wage workers and
small businesses. These premiums hit low-wage, small businesses the hard-
est and give all employers an incentive to substitute capital for labor. The
net impact on employment from the redistribution of health benefit costs is
difficult to assess. The Lewin-VHI analysis has estimated that as costs are
shared more equally across employers, the mandates would change costs by
$500 or more for three out of four employers that now provide some health
insurance: Costs would increase for 34 percent and decrease for 44 percent.
Studies of minimum wage increases find negligible overall employment
effects. For example, no detectable change in employment accompanied
the last such increase--from $3.55 to $4.25 an hour. This is equivalent to
an annual increase of $1,400 a year for a full-time worker--more than most
firms would experience under an employer premium mandate. Under the
Clinton plan, employer contributions for firms with 5,000 or fewer workers
would be capped at 3.5 to 7.9 percent of payroll, mitigating any adverse
employment effect. This is at most thirty-four cents an hour for a minimum-
wage worker, or barely half the last increase in the minimum wage.
Administrative complexity. Employer-paid premium mandates must
establish complex rules for the range of diverse work relationships. In
addition, employer premiums may vary for workers with single or family
coverage, or according to whether employees have a working spouse. If
employer contributions are tied to specific workers, a complex tracking
system must be established to assure that combined employer/employee/
government contributions cover the premium costs for each family. Ad-
ministrative mechanisms for determining and enforcing accurate subsidy
payments to firms and to low-income families also must be developed,
including adjustments for changes in family income, family composition,
and employment arrangements.
Regressivity and inequities. Employer and employee premium man-
dates maintain the current regressive insurance financing base. Even in
light of income-related premium caps for firms and individuals, the portion
of income the premium consumes declines as income rises. Premium man-
dates also mean that families with dependents will pay more of their income
for coverage than will single-person households with the same income.
Individual Premium Mandates
Existing congressional proposals that would mandate individual purchase
of health insurance do so through premium mandates. Individual premium
mandates, such as those proposed by Senator Chafee, would require all legal

ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL COVERAGE 15
residents to purchase health insurance either directly or by participating in
group plans provided by employers. The Chafee proposal would provide full
public premium subsidies for the poor and partial premium subsidies for
families with incomes up to 240 percent of poverty.
Avoidance of new burdens on business. The primary advantage of
individual mandates is avoidance of new burdens on business or adverse
employment effects. For business, the cost of labor remains unchanged if
families are required to purchase coverage directly.
Severed link between insurance coverage and employment status.
To achieve universal coverage, individual premium mandates must also
establish insurance administrative structures independent of employment
status. The Chafee plan would keep coverage employment-based by requir-
ing employers to offer, but not pay for, coverage. However, individual
mandates could be designed to provide a more secure insurance base for
coverage. The wide variety of coverage options includes buying the unin-
sured into Medicare or Medicaid or new private insurance purchasing pools.
Substantial federal subsidies to make insurance affordable. If cover-
age is to be universal, individual premium mandates must include substan-
tial federal subsidies. Even if subsidies could be restricted to those now
lacking insurance, full or partial subsidies to low- and middle-income fami-
lies would be needed to make premiums affordable.
Analysis of the Chafee proposal illustrates the problem. At present,
twenty-three million poor or near-poor persons are uninsured, and six
million purchase at least some insurance themselves. Assuming that all
would become eligible for public subsidies, an individual mandate would
add twenty-nine million people to the twenty-one million already receiving
public subsidies, according to our estimates.
Full vouchers for the working poor, however, would encourage employers
now paying for a share of premiums to drop coverage. Even if employers
were required to cover all employees equally, employers could provide
incentives for workers to turn down employer-paid coverage in favor of
public subsidies. For sliding-scale as well as full-subsidy families, employers
would have an incentive to lower employer-paid contribution rates and
shift costs to public programs. If employers reduced premium contributions
for all currently insured low-income workers, an additional twenty-two
million persons would be eligible for public subsidies, for a total of seventy-
two million. New incentives to drop coverage are likely to accelerate the
ongoing erosion in voluntary employer-financed coverage.
Regressivity and high marginal tax rates. Individual premium man-
dates are highly regressive. For example, a sliding-scale subsidy to 240
percent of poverty for family coverage would mean that a family of three
earning $28,500 would pay 13 percent of its income for health insurance,

16 HEALTH AFFAIRS | Spring (II) 1994
while families earning $95,000 or more would pay less than 5 percent
(assuming a benefit package similar to that in the Clinton plan).
If premium subsidies are phased out over a fairly narrow income range
(up to 240 percent of poverty under the Chafee plan), sliding scales impose
high marginal tax rates as incomes increase. For example, under the Chafee
proposal, as low-income families worked their way out of poverty, they
would pay nearly one out of every four dollars in wage increases for health
premiums. On top of the existing federal income and payroll taxes, man-
dates would mean a cumulative marginal tax rate of more than 50 percent
for low-income families, not counting the loss of benefits such as food
stamps or earned income credits, or increases in state or local taxes. Such
policies work against current federal and state efforts to remove disincen-
tives to work and to relieve tax burdens on those who can barely buy
necessities without welfare.
Inequality. Individual premium mandates also would treat households
with the same income differently depending on family status. At current
premium rates, an individual would pay a maximum of about $2,000, while
a family of three would pay nearly $4,000. Premiums also would differ
depending on whether persons lived in a high- or low-cost medical care
market. Most important, an individual mandate that assumes employers
that now insure would continue to do so leaves major inequities among
firms in the same industry or in the same area. Firms that voluntarily
provide coverage are at a disadvantage relative to those that do not.
Difficulty of enforcement. Policies that require the uninsured to buy
insurance are likely to be difficult to enforce. Mandates would require low-
and middle-income families to pay regular premiums amounting to a sub-
stantial share of family income. Mandates would apply to the homeless and
others with unstable work and family situations. Delinquency and failure to
pay are likely to be regular problems. Unless insurance coverage were
continuous regardless of whether families met premium obligations, en-
forcement difficulties could undermine the goal of universal coverage.
Tax Financing Options
The policy decision to make universal coverage mandatory is at its core a
decision to share the costs of health care across society. Like universal
public education, universal health care coverage sets a moral standard and
a community commitment to provide access to a basic necessity in a
modern economy.
Alternatives to employer or individual premium mandates lie in a variety
of tax financing options. Alone or in combination with some form of
premium mandate, they could minimize or eliminate some of the disadvan-

ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL COVERAGE 17
tages of "head tax" premium mandates while building on current financing
mixes. For example, converting flat premium contributions into a "payroll
premium" tax, with an 80 percent employer and 20 percent employee share,
could continue employment-based financing. Private business expenditures
for group health insurance premiums now amount to roughly 7-8 percent of
total private wages and salaries. Employee contributions to private insur-
ance amount to an additional 2 percent (counting purchases of individual
policies by the self-employed).14 A conversion to a 9 or 10 percent payroll
premium tax shared by employers and workers on an eighty-twenty basis
would retain current levels of employment-based spending in the aggregate,
although redistribution among firms would occur. Income-related premium
taxes could be used to finance coverage for nonworking individuals and
families. General tax revenues or a portion of the payroll premium tax and
income-related premium taxes could subsidize coverage for the poor. Alter-
natively, there could be a mix of a premium mandate for full-time employ-
ees of large firms and payroll premium taxes for all part-time, temporary,
and contractual workers.
Income-related contributions collected from employers and families
could be deposited in private purchasing pools similar to those proposed by
the Clinton plan or could pay to extend Medicare-like coverage to all. An
intermediate option would cover everyone under a Medicare-type plan
financed by payroll taxes for workers and income taxes on nonworkers;
employers could opt out of their payroll tax obligation by purchasing
comparable coverage privately.15
Insurance stability and security. Income-related contributions or tax
mandates require insurance coverage strategies that break the link between
employer financing and administration of insurance. While such severance
is possible with employer premium mandates, financing based on wage and
other income rather than employment status drives structural decisions
toward administrative mechanisms that pool purchase of coverage in a way
that does not change when people change work or family status.
Regressivity and equity. Tax mandates offer a less regressive route
toward universality than does premium financing. By moving away from a
flat premium per person, or head tax, and instead relating contributions
directly to ability to pay, a tax option could distribute costs more equitably
across income classes and low- and higher-wage firms than either employer
or individual premium mandates could. At the same time, by relating
contributions to income at the outset and thus directly addressing ability to
pay, tax mandates avoid the need for complex subsidy arrangements.
Single-person and family households with the same income would pay
similar amounts. Health costs for dependents would be shared through a
common pool of funds to cover services. Employers and families would not

be penalized for being in high-cost health care areas.
Labor-market efficiency. Premium financing, whether mandatory or
voluntary, gives employers an incentive to discriminate among employees
by personal characteristics likely to be related to higher health costs.
Employers can reduce fringe benefit costs by hiring and retaining single,
younger employees and by avoiding workers with families, single-parent
families, older workers, women of child-bearing age, pregnant women, and
workers with other characteristics likely to require health care. Premium
financing based on employment also gives employers an incentive to use
temporary, seasonal, or part-time workers or independent contractors. Em-
ployers thus can shift health insurance obligations off corporate budgets
and onto family budgets or other employers.
Tax mandates based on payroll, income, or other broad-based taxes
would minimize these incentives. In particular, payroll-related contribu-
tions should make employers less sensitive to whether workers work part or
full time or on a temporary or permanent basis. A payroll-based mandate
should eliminate concerns about the personal health characteristics of
employees that are not related to productivity.
Horizontal equity. Tax-based strategies also spread health costs more
equally across firms, thereby removing competitive advantages based on
location or employee characteristics. In addition, they can narrow differen-
tials that develop because older, stable companies tend to have more
retirees relative to current employees than do start-up firms or firms that
have recently relocated.
Administrative enforceability. Tax mandates rely on existing tax col-
lection procedures to enforce financing obligations. Thus, employer with-
holdings from wage and salary payrolls would provide an enforceable base
with which to finance health insurance. For low-income families and
transient workers, collection mechanisms are likely to be less complex than
those associated with premium mandate strategies.
Distributional changes. Distributional swings from current financing
are the primary disadvantage for tax financing. The percentage of payroll
that business contributes for health insurance now varies widely across
industries and across firms within an industry. Workers similarly find that
widely disparate shares of their total compensation go to health fringe
benefits and that compensation rates vary by hour and by employment
arrangements within the same company. Thus, even if tax mandates were
set near the current averages, new premiums related to wage and salary
bases would produce transitional swings in the distribution of labor costs.

ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL COVERAGE 19
tion that conversion of existing premium payments to more tax-like,
income-related contributions would be an increase in taxes even if total
expenditures remained the same. These perceptions add to the appeal of
premium mandates or individual mandates. In addition, even if collections
were paid out to state regional funds or quasi-private purchasing alliances or
trust funds, conversion of financing to a mix including tax-like mandates
might be counted as new on-budget federal costs.
Reaching Consensus
As this discussion of the advantages and disadvantages illustrates, financ-
ing universal coverage is likely to require a mixed approach that weighs
social, economic, and political concerns. The goal must be to determine a
mix that is equitable, has a minimal burden on the economy, is easy to
administer, and assures stable coverage. Phasing can ease transitional issues
such as redistribution of costs among employers and families.
One attractive alternative is to build on the current mix of employer
coverage and Medicare. The uninsured could automatically be covered by
Medicare, if they were not otherwise covered. Employers that do not
finance coverage for workers could be required to contribute either a flat
premium per worker or a payroll tax to Medicare. Uninsured families also
could be assessed an income-related contribution for Medicare coverage
administered through the personal income tax. This would achieve univer-
sal coverage, assure an equitable basis of financing, be relatively easy to
administer since it builds on the current Medicare program and tax collec-
tion system, and provide minimum disruption to current private insurance
coverage. In the short term, Medicare would be open only to the uninsured
but eventually could provide an option for coverage for all, including
current Medicaid beneficiaries and workers now covered through their
employer.
Regardless of the mix of financing chosen, achieving universal coverage
quickly is an important policy priority. Each year the voluntary employ-
ment foundation of our current insurance system deteriorates further, and
efforts to cope create an ever more complex mix of hidden taxes and cross-
subsidies. We now have an opportunity to move to a new, more secure
health system and to correct health financing policies that are more an
accident of history than the result of explicit policies.

20 HEALTH AFFAIRS | Spring (II) 1994
NOTES
1. Employer-based health insurance today covers just over half of the U.S. population (55
percent). Another 8 percent purchase health insurance individually. About one in five
Americans are covered by public programs--Medicare and Medicaid.
2. Unless otherwise noted, all statistics on the uninsured are from U.S. Bureau of the
Census, Current Population Survey, March 1993, as reported by the Employee Benefit
Research Institute, Sources of Health Insurance and Characteristics of the Uninsured,
Analysis of the March 1993 Current Population Survey, Issue Brief 145 (Washington:
EBRI, January 1994).
3. The Commonwealth Fund and The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, press release,
11 November 1993. See also D. Rowland et al., "A Profile of the Uninsured in
America," Health Affairs (Spring II 1994): 283-237. Census surveys find similar
statistics for those uninsured over a period of time. See K. Swartz, "Dynamics of People
without Health Insurance, Don't Let the Numbers Fool You," Journal of the American
Medical Association (5 January 1994): 64-66.
4. While Medicaid is an important source of health insurance coverage for low-income
Americans, it has significant gaps. Thirty-four states have eligibility levels that are less
than half the federal poverty level. Because of categorical restrictions, 46 percent of the
poor and only 10 percent of the near-poor (with incomes between the poverty level
and twice the poverty level) have Medicaid coverage. House Energy and Commerce
Subcommittee on Health and Environment, Medicaid Source Book: Background Data
and Analysis (Washington: U.S. Government Printing Office, January 1993).
5. Of the poor, more than half are in families in which someone works at least part time
or part of the year. Of the near-poor, five out of six are in such families.

1992-2005," Monthiy Lobar Review (November 1993): 3-86.
7. EBRI, Sources of Health Insurance and Characteristics of the Uninsured.
8. Authors' calculation based on 1993 employment data in "Current Labor Statistics,"
Monthly Labor Review (November 1993): Tables 5,12, 106, and 110. Contingent jobs
included part time, temporary agency, household, self-employed, and unpaid employees
as a proportion of total employment in September 1993.
9. Any legal requirement that residents and businesses participate and pay for a service is
to some extent a "tax." This paper refers to required flat payments per person or family
or head taxes as premiums and wage- or income-related contributions as taxes.
10. Subsidies would apply to working families with incomes up to 150 percent of poverty
and to nonworking families with incomes up to 250 percent of poverty. The income-
related cap under the Clinton proposal is 3.9 percent for income under $40,000.
11. For a comparative description of the Chafee, Clinton, and other reform proposals, see
J. Darnell and P. Long, Summary ofMajor Health Care Reform Legislation (Washington:
Kaiser Commission on the Future of Medicaid, December 1993).
12. There is a serious question whether sufficient savings could be found in Medicare and
Medicaid to finance coverage for both working and nonworking low-income individu-
als and families eligible for subsidies.
