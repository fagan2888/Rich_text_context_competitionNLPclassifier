Background: Large numbers of convicted drunk driv-
ers are entering alcohol treatment programs, yet little in-
formation is available about their need for psychiatric treat-
ment. This study of convicted drunk drivers estimates
lifetime and 12-month prevalence of DSM-III-R psychiat-
ric disorders (alcohol and drug abuse and dependence, ma-
jor depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, generalized
anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anti-
social personality disorder) and compares rates with es-
timates from a US population-based survey.
Methods: Six hundred twelve women and 493 men, aged
23 to 54 years, convicted of driving while impaired, who
had been referred to a screening program in Bernalillo
County, New Mexico, were located and interviewed us-
ing the Diagnostic Interview Schedule between January 25,
1994, and June 30, 1997. Psychiatric diagnoses were com-
pared with findings from the National Comorbidity Sur-
vey for the western region of the United States, con-
ductedbetweenSeptember14,1990,andFebruary6,1992.
Results: Eighty-five percent of female and 91% of
male offenders reported a lifetime alcohol-use disor-
der, compared with 22% and 44%, respectively, in the
National Comorbidity Survey sample. Thirty-two per-
cent of female and 38% of male offenders had a drug-
use disorder, compared with 16% and 21%, respec-
tively, in the National Comorbidity Survey sample.
For offenders with alcohol-use disorders, 50% of
women and 33% of men had at least 1 additional psy-
chiatric disorder other than drug abuse or depen-
dence, mainly posttraumatic stress disorder or major
depression.
Conclusion: Drunk-driving offenders need assess-
ment and treatment services not only for alcohol prob-
lems but also for drug use and the other psychiatric
disorders that commonly accompany alcohol-related
problems.

BETWEEN1995and1998,more
than 1.4 million Americans
were arrested annually for
driving while impaired
(DWI).1 Offenders are
entering alcohol treatment programs in
record numbers,2 and, for many, the
DWI conviction presents an opportu-
nity for early intervention.2 But DWI
treatment programs have shown disap-
pointing results, with neither recidivism
nor alcohol-related crashes substantially
reduced.3-5
Severalfactorscontributetothesefind-
ings. Typically, offenders are coerced into
treatment programs and may not be moti-
vated to change their drinking habits. The
programs offered often are abstinence-
oriented, an end point many offenders be-
lieve is inappropriate.5 Also, offenders are
likely to have emotional and psychiatric
problems in addition to alcohol-related
problems, making treatment more chal-
lenging.6,7 Finally,"treatments"forDWIof-
fenders often include short-term pro-
grams5 that focus primarily on educating
offenders about the effects of alcohol or
about drunk-driving laws.8
Treatment programs should be tai-
lored to clients' specific offense histories,
the severity of their drinking problems, and
their other psychiatric problems.8,9 But
little systematic research has examined the
level of severity of drinking problems or
other psychiatric problems among ar-
rested or convicted DWI offenders,2,10-12
and often conclusions rely on self-
reported information from coerced sub-
jects.11,13,14 These studies also suffer from
methodological problems, inconsisten-
cies in defining alcohol problem sta-
tus,2,11 and use of samples with more se-
vere alcohol-related problems than are
found in the overall population of con-
victed offenders.7,11

In a review of 22 studies on drinking-driving of-
fenders and alcoholism, the percentage of offenders con-
sidered to be "alcoholic" ranged from 4% to 87%.11 This
wide range in the estimated prevalence of alcohol prob-
lems among DWI offenders creates uncertainty about how
to deal effectively with these populations.11 The Insti-
tute of Medicine2 draws the rather unhelpful conclu-
sion from the literature that convicted drunk-driving of-
fenders referred to treatment have higher rates of alcohol-
use disorders than are found in the general population
and lower rates than clinical populations.
Less is known about the prevalence of this popula-
tion's drug-use or non­substance-abuse psychiatric dis-
orders. Researchers have examined the bodily fluids of
crash-involved drivers, finding high rates of drug preva-
lence in addition to alcohol (10%-22%).15 This says little
about offenders' drug-use disorders. Studies suggest that
drunk-driving offenders have high rates of antisocial be-
havior14,16-18 and high levels of depression19-21 and that re-
peat offenders are particularly likely to exhibit antiso-
cial tendencies and other psychopathologic conditions.21-23
However, this literature provides an inadequate psychi-
atric profile of the DWI-offender population.
This study, by systematically collecting diagnostic
data, strives to determine (1) the prevalence of DWI of-
fenders' alcohol use and comorbid psychiatric disorders
and (2) how much this differs from that of the general
community. We argue that primary care and mental health
care professionals need to understand DWI offenders' al-
cohol use, drug use, and other non­substance-abuse psy-
chiatric disorders. Only then can more appropriate and
effective treatment interventions be designed.
RESULTS
PREVALENCE OF LIFETIME AND 12-MONTH
PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IN THE DWI SAMPLE
Eighty-five percent of women and 91% of men reported
lifetime alcohol-use disorders (abuse or dependence)
(P.01) (Table 2). More than 30% of women and 35%
of men had a 12-month diagnosis of alcohol dependence.
About one third of offenders met criteria for lifetime drug-
use disorders (abuse or dependence) (Table 2), most hav-
ing drug dependence. Ten percent of women and 12% of
men reported a 12-month drug dependence disorder. The
percentage of interviewees reporting neither alcohol nor
drug diagnoses was 13% for women and 8% for men.
Lifetime major depressive disorder was found in 28%
of women and 13% of men. Major depressive disorder
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
SUBJECTS
The sample was drawn from a database of convicted DWI
offenders referred to and screened by the Lovelace Com-
prehensive Screening Program (LCSP).24 This program con-
tracted with the Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court, Al-
buquerque, NM, to provide screening services to convicted
first offenders. Although the LCSP was a first-offender pro-
gram, about 20% of referrals were repeat offenders at the
time of their referral.25
Details about the LCSP have been published.24 Previ-
ous studies in this population found characteristics similar
to those of DWI-offender populations described elsewhere
in the United States with respect to age, sex, and marital sta-
tus,24-26 but this population has higher proportions of His-
panics and American Indians than those in other geographi-
calareas(seeVingilis,11 Perrineetal,13 andMoskowitzetal27).
The mean blood alcohol concentration at arrest for offend-
ers in the LCSP is 0.16 g/dL, which is in the middle range of
mean blood alcohol concentrations for drunk drivers ar-
rested elsewhere in the United States.28
The sample for the present study included 1208 con-
secutive women referrals from April 4, 1989, through March
31, 1992, and 1407 men drawn from all men referred for
screening during the study. Subjects were selected weekly,
corresponding to the 5-year anniversary of their LCSP refer-
ral.Menwerefrequencymatchedtowomenbydateofscreen-
ing referral and ethnicity and were oversampled, as a previ-
ous survey conducted in a New Mexico community revealed
higher refusal rates among men (39%) than women (21%).29
Information about nonlocated subjects was sent to the
National Death Index to match against death certificates
filed in all states (excluding New York, NY), identifying 18
women and 38 men as deceased. Of the remaining 2559
subjects, 2062 (81%) were located (1005 women and 1057
men) and 1396 were interviewed. Most (85%) resided in
New Mexico; the remainder lived in 37 other states. Two
women and 5 men were excluded because of incomplete
information. Analyses to determine differences between in-
terviewed and noninterviewed subjects showed that, after
controlling for demographic factors, the interviewed and
noninterviewed subjects had similar blood alcohol con-
centrations at arrest and similar diagnoses of alcohol abuse
and dependence at screening.30
Also eliminated were 127 women and 107 men who
were not either white or Hispanic and 19 women and 31
men older than 54 years. These limitations were imposed
to enable comparisons with the national sample. This yielded
a final DWI sample of 612 women and 493 men. Sex com-
parisons revealed that they were similar with respect to age,
ethnic distribution, and educational level, but differed with
respect to marital status, income, and number of prior DWIs
(Table 1).
Complete methods for locating and interviewing sub-
jects are published.30 The primary data source for locating
clients was LCSP record data; other databases also were used.
Acomprehensivelocationprotocolwasusedbybilingual(En-
glish and Spanish) staff, including a letter sequence, tele-
phone calls, and home visits. (Subjects were mailed a series
of letters at 2-week intervals. A letter sequence included 5
identical letters explaining the study and asking the client
to participate, and 1 "pleading letter" emphasizing the im-
portance of the study.) About 32% were telephone inter-
views, conducted with out-of-state subjects and those un-
willing or unable to be interviewed in person. In-person
interviews were conducted at our office, at a neutral loca-
tion, or in the subjects' own home. Once located, willing par-
ticipants provided written informed consent and were given
a monetary incentive to complete the interview. The proto-
col was approved by an institutional review board.

was experienced by 17% of women and 7% of men in the
12 months before the interview. A higher proportion of
women than men experienced lifetime and 12-month dys-
thymic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and PTSD.
A higher proportion of men than women met criteria for
antisocial personality disorder.
COMPARISONS WITH THE NCS SAMPLE
The prevalence of lifetime alcohol abuse and depen-
dence, and drug dependence for both sexes was much
higher in the DWI than in the matched NCS sample (Table
2). For example, at 61% for women and 70% for men,
the rates of lifetime alcohol dependence among DWI of-
fenders were more than twice those of the respective NCS
samples. Reported 12-month symptoms of alcohol and
other drug dependence diagnoses in the DWI popula-
tion also exceeded those in the NCS population.
Among offenders with alcohol abuse or dependence,
similarproportionsofwomenintheDWIandNCSsamples
(about half) reported at least 1 additional psychiatric dis-
order (Table 3). The 3 most common additional disor-
dersweredrugdependence,majordepressivedisorder,and
PTSD. Compared with the NCS sample, a lower percent-
age of men (DWI sample, 33%; NCS sample, 42%) had at
least 1 additional psychiatric disorder, the most common
being drug dependence, major depressive disorder, anti-
social personality disorder, and PTSD.
COMMENT
Common sense and previous research have already in-
formed researchers that the DWI-offender population has
high rates of alcohol­use disorders. What is significant
about this report's findings is how high these rates are,
especially when compared with those of the general com-
munity sample. In addition to the high rates, most indi-
viduals involved with alcohol or other drugs in the DWI
sample met criteria for lifetime dependence, whereas in
the general population sample there was a higher pro-
portion with abuse (without dependence). These data
suggest that as a group the population of DWI offenders
is closer to a clinical than a nonclinical population.
Furthermore, 12-month diagnoses indicate a high de-
gree of symptoms in the ensuing years following the
DWI referral, which underscores the need for effective
therapies in this population.
Some studies suggest that the proportion of alco-
holics in DWI-offender populations is lower than that
reported in the present study. Fine and colleagues44
Rates of substance abuse and other psychiatric disor-
ders in the general adult population from the National Co-
morbidity Survey (NCS)31 were compared with those of DWI
offenders. The NCS is based on a stratified, multistage area
probability sample of noninstitutionalized civilians aged 15
to 54 years living in the 48 contiguous states and includes
more than 8000 respondents. The survey was conducted
between September 14, 1990, and February 6, 1992. Only
subjects who lived in the western region of the United States
(Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Ari-
zona, Utah, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, California,
Alaska, or Hawaii) were included for comparison with the
DWI sample. The NCS assessed DSM-III-R32 criteria using
the Composite International Diagnostic Interview,33 which
is derived from, and a refinement of, the Diagnostic Inter-
view Schedule (DIS).31
DIAGNOSIS
Interviewers were trained by one of us (E.S.) and met weekly
to monitor consistency and discuss coding issues. Inter-
views, conducted from January 25, 1994, to June 30, 1997,
included demographic information and a computerized ver-
sion of the DIS.34,35 The DIS, structured and designed for
use by lay interviewers, has good to acceptable levels of va-
lidity and reliability with general population samples.36-41
The interviewers read the DIS questions to subjects and en-
tered their responses into the computer. The DIS deter-
mines symptoms of disease, diagnoses, and age when the
subject met criteria for the diagnosis corresponding to the
DSM-III-R.35 Disorders assessed for the present study in-
clude rates of lifetime and 12-month alcohol and drug abuse
and dependence, major depressive disorder, dysthymic dis-
order, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress dis-
order (PTSD), and antisocial personality disorder. Life-
time prevalence is the percentage of persons who met
diagnostic criteria for a disorder at any time in their lives
and 12-month prevalence is the percentage of subjects who
experienced the disorder within the 12 months before the
follow-up interview.
COMPARISON SAMPLE
National Comorbidity Survey data were obtained from the
public-use data file, downloaded from the Internet site main-
tained by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and
Social Research. Neither the NCS data nor the DWI data in-
cludedinformationthatwouldallowidentificationoftheHis-
panic subgroup (eg, Mexican American, Cuban American,
or Puerto Rican). However, most Hispanic populations in
the western United States are Mexican American.42
DATA ANALYSES
Comparisons between the 2 samples were made by weight-
ing the NCS sample to match the DWI-offender sample by
age (23-29, 30-34, 35-44, or 45-54 years), ethnicity, and
educational level (0-11, 12, or 13 years). All compari-
sons between the 2 samples were made separately for men
and women. For the NCS sample, all observations in a spe-
cific age, ethnic group, or educational level stratum were
assigned a weight, computed as the ratio of the proportion
of DWI offenders to the proportion of NCS respondents
in that stratum. Weights for all observations in the DWI-
offender sample were set to 1.0. All proportions, SEs, and
tests of significance were computed using the SUDAAN pro-
cedure CROSSTAB.43 The sampling design was specified
as stratified sampling with replacement. Taylor series lin-
earization was selected as the method for variance estima-
tion. Tests for statistically significant differences between
the 2 samples were made using a 2 test statistic analo-
gous to the Pearson 2.43

classify 50% of first-DWI offenders as beginning prob-
lem drinkers, with only 8% evaluated as having serious
alcohol-related problems. Stewart et al45 studied more than
5000 first-DWI offenders, finding that 92% had low scores
on the Alcohol Dependence Scale.46 However, no diag-
nostic interviews were conducted in this population.
Conversely, several studies find rates approaching
those in the present study. A longitudinal study17 of a com-
munity sample of young men reports that among those
later convicted of drunk driving, about half were alco-
hol dependent at follow-up. Clinical evaluations of con-
secutive first offenders in a Massachusetts court found
that 82% were alcoholics or problem drinkers.47 Small48
suggests that 50% of all first-time, 70% of second-time,
and 100% of third-time DWI offenders are alcoholics. Re-
sults of these studies support our suggestion that any his-
tory of conviction for drunk driving should alert the ex-
amining physician to evaluate the patient for alcohol abuse
and dependence.
Only 2 previously published studies have used struc-
tured diagnostic interviews to determine diagnoses of al-
cohol abuse or dependence in DWI-offender popula-
tions. The first was conducted among 617 New York
offenders (men, 85%; white, 86%; repeat offenders, 56%)
referred for alcohol evaluation.49 The authors' findings
were similar to ours with respect to the proportion of
women with alcohol dependence (61%) but higher for
men (82%). Another New York study,50 conducted among
184 convicted DWI-offender volunteers, found alcohol
dependence in 66% of first and 87% of repeat offenders.
This is the first study to evaluate rates of drug abuse
and dependence in a DWI-offender sample. Findings dem-
onstrate a high degree of involvement with drugs other
than alcohol. Drug abuse or dependence was reported
by an estimated 32% of women and 38% of men. These
rates greatly exceed those in the general community
sample. Findings are consistent with research showing
that a high percentage of crash drivers15 and drivers sus-
pected of impaired driving51,52 have used other drugs in
addition to alcohol. It also is consistent with investiga-
tions done in community and clinical samples of per-
sons with alcohol-use disorders, finding high rates of drug
problems.53 These data suggest that all persons with
drunk-driving offenses should also undergo evaluation
for drug-use disorders.
Study limitations include the low participation rates
and the procedures used to assign diagnoses. Low par-
ticipation rates are addressed in another report,30 which
showed that alcohol diagnosis and blood alcohol con-
centration at arrest of subjects interviewed were similar

to those of subjects not interviewed, suggesting that bias
was not a factor with respect to alcohol diagnoses. Pos-
sible biases with respect to other psychiatric disorders,
however, were not evaluated.
Comparison between the DWI and NCS surveys in-
dicates that although both used the same diagnostic cri-
teria (DSM-III-R), the interviews were not identical, with
the NCS interview perhaps yielding higher prevalence es-
timates than the DIS.31 Also, the DWI and NCS surveys
were administered by lay interviewers. Neither inter-
view yields results as accurate as those of clinicians skilled
in assigning diagnoses.31 The study limitations would be
expected to lead to conservative prevalence estimates for
most diagnoses in the DWI sample.
New Mexico is notorious for its high alcohol-
related traffic fatality rates,54 which may suggest that these
offenders may have higher rates of psychiatric problems
than offenders from other states. This concern is miti-
gated by the similarities of our sample to other DWI-
offender populations and by our sample's nonclinical na-
ture. If anything, these factors would lead to projected
underestimates of the true rate of alcohol diagnoses, com-
pared with national rates.
This study is also unique in its inclusion of a large
sample of female offenders. Because women constitute
a small proportion (13%-18%) of all DWI arrests nation-
ally, only a few studies55-58 have focused on female of-
fenders. We found that rates of alcohol-use disorders are
higher for male than female offenders. This is inconsis-
tent with findings of a 1970s study59 suggesting that
women arrested for DWI may have higher levels of sub-
stance-use disorders compared with male offenders. But
recent studies23,60,61 report lower or similar sex-specific
rates of alcohol dependence among female offenders. In
the present study, there were no sex differences among
subjects in drug abuse or dependence.
Our findings also agree with study results from a non-
clinical sample of DWI offenders that found women who
are alcohol dependent report higher levels of depres-
sion symptoms than men who are alcohol dependent.23
Other sex differences in the offender population are con-
sistent with characteristics of the general population.62
However, our findings that female offenders are more
likely than male offenders to have affective disorders and
PTSD, but not antisocial personality disorder, do not sup-
port the conclusion of Argeriou and Paulino59 that fe-
male DWI offenders may have higher levels of "social
pathologic conditions" than men. Our data suggest that
female DWI offenders diverge more from the general
population of women with respect to overall psychiatric
morbidity than male offenders diverge from the general
male population.
Considering the high rate of alcohol and other drug
dependence diagnoses in the DWI-offender population,
a high level of comorbidity is expected, because indi-
viduals with alcohol-use disorders, in clinical and com-
munity samples, often have additional comorbid disor-
ders.63 A study50 conducted among DWI offenders using
the SCL-90-R64 self-report inventory for psychopatho-
logic conditions found that the prevalence of psychiat-
ric symptoms was strongly related to whether the indi-
vidual had a DSM-III-R diagnosis of alcohol dependence.
Comparison of overall rates of these disorders in the sub-
set of DWI offenders with alcohol-use disorders in a com-
parable NCS sample reveals high rates of other co-
occurring disorders in both samples.
Studies5,9,21 have pointed to the heterogeneity of
DWI-offender populations and the need for typologies
to better match offenders with treatments geared to
their specific needs. Our study suggests that, while
there is a great deal of heterogeneity with respect to
psychiatric comorbidity, only a small percentage (men,
9%; women, 15%) did not meet lifetime criteria for
alcohol-use disorders, far exceeding the rates in the
general population. Our findings also indicate that
treatment providers for DWI populations should be
prepared to evaluate for and address psychiatric prob-
lems commonly co-occurring in populations with
alcohol-use disorders. This is especially important
because studies of comorbid psychiatric disorders
among persons with alcoholism find that the severity of
psychiatric symptoms is often predictive of poor treat-
ment outcome for those who are substance abusers.65,66
Furthermore, more intense interventions at an early
stage may reduce recidivism and crash rates.3 Early
detection is particularly important for women, who are
more likely to experience psychiatric comorbidity and
less likely to seek early help for drinking problems.67
