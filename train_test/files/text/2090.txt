THERE is an evolving literature about the impact of
physiologic processes, and biomarkers of these pro-
cesses, on function and mortality in aging populations. Pre-
viously, increased inflammation and coagulation have been
related to functional decline and earlier mortality indepen-
dent of associations with demographics and specific dis-
eases (1­10). Because endothelial dysfunction has been
linked to a number of diseases associated with aging, type 2
diabetes (11), sleep apnea (12), ischemic stroke (13),
Alzheimer's and vascular dementia (14), metastatic malig-
nancies (15), and severe hip and knee osteoarthritis (16), we
sought to determine if a marker of endothelial dysfunction,
as indicated in this case by vascular cell adhesion molecule
(VCAM), might impact functional decline and mortality
independent of inflammation and coagulation.
VCAM is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on
the surface of activated endothelial cells and vascular
smooth muscle cells (17). VCAM recruits leukocytes to
areas of inflammation by promoting adhesion of circulating
inflammatory cells to endothelium (reviewed in 18). Ex-
pression of VCAM is typically promoted by inflammatory
molecules, including tumor-necrosis factor alpha and inter-
leukin-1 beta (reviewed in 17,18). When endothelial cells
are activated by inflammatory cytokines, soluble VCAM
(s-VCAM) is generated via proteolytic cleavage at or near
the site where the protein inserts into the endothelial cell
membrane (17,19). The proportion of the membrane-bound
form released as s-VCAM from activated cells is estimated
to be as much as 20% of total cellular VCAM (19). s-
VCAM can induce T-cell chemotaxis, contributing to sy-

Background. We wished to determine if a marker of endothelial dysfunction/activation soluble vascular cell
adhesion molecule (s-VCAM)--was related to functional status and mortality in community-dwelling older adults
independent of the known effects of markers of inflammation and coagulation.
Methods. Data came from the third and fourth in-person waves of the Duke Established Populations for Epidemio-
logic Studies of the Elderly. Participants (aged  71 years) had participated in a blood draw (N = 1,551) from which
concentrations of s-VCAM, interleukin-6, and d-dimer were determined. Information was gathered in-person on
demographics, health behaviors, chronic health conditions, and functional status (Katz, Rosow­Breslau, Nagi). Death
was determined through the National Death Index. Multivariable regression analysis was used to examine the adjusted
association of s-VCAM with functional status; Cox proportional hazards models ascertained hazard of mortality.
Results. Controlled analyses indicated that cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally (4 years later), greater s-VCAM
concentrations were associated with poorer function as measured by the Katz and Rosow­Breslau scales (p < .05 for
both), independent of interleukin-6 and d-dimer. In controlled analyses, s-VCAM (p = .002), d-dimer (p = .008), and
interleukin-6 (p = .01) were independently related to 4-year mortality; 1 SD increase in log concentration conferred 1.2-,
1.1-, and 1.2-fold increases in mortality, respectively. The greatest hazard of mortality was observed within the first year
after measurement. s-VCAM concentrations were not predictive of 15-year mortality.
Conclusions. Independent of inflammation and coagulation markers, endothelial dysfunction serves as a marker of,
and potentially contributes causally to, poor function and death in community-dwelling older adults.

novial inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (20) and
recruit eosinophils to lungs in animal models of asthma
(21). Given these pathologic roles of s-VCAM and the as-
sociation of elevated s-VCAM with abundant endothelial
activation, detection of elevated concentrations of s-VCAM
is commonly equated with endothelial dysfunction (17,18).
Our group has previously demonstrated relations for both
inflammation, as indicated by interleukin-6 (IL-6), and
coagulation, as indicated by d-dimer, with functional decline
and mortality (3,4,9,22). Given these relations, we wished
to determine the associations of s-VCAM with function and
mortality, independent of the impacts of IL-6 and d-dimer.
We hypothesized that concentrations of s-VCAM, a marker
of endothelial dysfunction and activation, would be related
to functional status and mortality independent of disease
state, demographics, and markers of inflammation and
coagulation in a sample of community-dwelling older adults.
Methods
Participant Population
The National Institute on Aging­funded Duke Estab-
lished Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly
has been described previously (3,23).
Measures
Demographic information (self-reported age, sex, race,
and education) was collected at enrollment (1986). At the
third in-person interview (1992­1993), the baseline for the
current study, height and weight were measured, and body
mass index (kg/m2) was calculated. Other information
gathered at the same time included the following.
Blood collection subsample.--Blood was collected in
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid­containing tubes, centri-
fuged, and plasma was stored at -70°C in 0.5-mL aliquots.
As previously reported, 67% (1,727) of those interviewed
had a successful blood sample obtained (3). Of the 1,727,
s-VCAM could be measured for 1,551. This sample of
1,551 constitutes the analysis sample for the present study.
Functional status.--Assessments of functional status
included Katz (24), Rosow­Breslau (25), and Nagi (26)
scales. Katz reports on five activities of daily living: bath-
ing, dressing, transferring from bed to chair, toileting, and
eating. The abbreviated Rosow­Breslau assesses partici-
pants' abilities to do heavy house work, walk up a flight of
stairs, and walk a half mile. The Nagi scale assesses fine and
gross motor activity, including abilities to extend the arms
above the shoulders, manipulate small objects, stoop or
kneel, carry a 10-pound item, and push a large object. Items
were scored dichotomously, with higher scores indicating
poorer function. Function was reassessed during an in-person
interview 4 years later (1996­1997).
Cognitive status and depression.--Cognitive status was
assessed in terms of errors on the Short Portable Mental
Status Questionnaire (27). Depression was assessed with a
modified version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies--
Depression scale (28), in which the original 4-point scale
for each item was dichotomized (condition present versus
absent). A score of 9 on this abbreviated measure has been
found to be equivalent to a score of 16 on the original (29).
Higher scores indicated more cognitive impairment or
depression.
Self-rated health.--Self-rated health was assessed with
the question "Overall, how would you rate your health."
Four responses were possible: "excellent," "good," "fair,"
and "poor."
Chronic conditions.--The presence of five chronic
medical problems (cancer, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, and
hypertension) was assessed with the question "Did a doctor
ever tell you that you had . . ."
Sleep.--Sleep problems were assessed by asking partici-
pants how often they had difficulty falling asleep. Three
responses were possible: "rarely or never," "sometimes,"
and "most of the time or always."
Smoking and alcohol.--Smoking status was determined
by asking whether the participant currently smoked ciga-
rettes. Alcohol use was assessed with a question on whether
individuals consumed two or more drinks of beer, wine, or
liquor each week.
Biomarker Analyses
Concentrations of IL-6, d-dimer, and s-VCAM were
measured by enzyme-linked immunoassays (Quantikine,
R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; Dimertest Tripwell EIA
kit, American Diagnostical, Greenwich, CT; and R&D Sys-
tems, Minneapolis, MN, respectively). Analyses of IL-6 and
d-dimer concentrations and characteristics were reported
previously (3,4), whereas subsequent analyses of s-VCAM
were possible for 1,551 individuals with sufficient plasma
remaining after the initial biomarker analyses were com-
pleted (30). Computed from raw s-VCAM data, the intraas-
say coefficient of variation, calculated as the mean
coefficient of variation for 57 samples run in duplicate, was
3.91%. The interassay coefficient of variations for low,
medium, and high concentrations were 7.8%, 3.1%, and
0.14%, respectively; these were determined from the low,
medium, and high concentration standards across 20 plates.
Mortality Assessments
Mortality was assessed via a combination of family state-
ments and National Death Index searches (31).
S-VCAM, FUNCTION, AND MORTALITY 1371
Statistical Analyses
Handling missing data.--When data were missing, we
imputed the mode for categorical variables, the median for
ordinal variables, and the mean for continuous variables.
The maximum number of missing values for a single variable
was 52 for baseline function assessed with the Nagi scale.
Analysis.--Biomarker variables (s-VCAM, IL-6, and
d-dimer) were log-transformed to approximate a normal
distribution prior to modeling. Standardized z scores ([raw
data ­ population mean]/standard deviation) were created
for log-transformed biomarker concentrations to allow
comparison among the three biomarker parameter esti-
mates. The impact on physical function outcomes (Katz,
Rosow­Breslau, and Nagi scores) was assessed with Pearson
correlations and, to account for covariates as described
subsequently, with general linear modeling by ordinary
least squares (regression) procedures. Cox-proportional
hazards modeling was used for determining predictors of
4- (1996) and 15-year (2008) mortality. As a final test of the
assumptions of this model, both the proportionality and the
linearity assumptions were tested for the variables of inter-
est. Analyses were controlled for age, sex, race, education,
body mass index, cognitive status, depression, self-rated
health, cancer, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, hypertension,
sleeping difficulties, smoking, and alcohol use. To evaluate
for potential s-VCAM by demographic or health factor in-
teractions and to control for type I error, chunks of interac-
tions were tested using multivariable tests including VCAM
by x, where x was the vector of all covariates entered into
the model for each outcome. If the overall test was positive,
then, each two-way interaction was tested individually (32).
Results
Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal (4-Year) Association
of Biomarkers With Functional Status
Table 1 shows characteristics of the 1,551 participants for
whom s-VCAM data were available. Cross-sectionally,
greater s-VCAM concentrations (log s-VCAM) were related
to poorer function regardless of measure (Table 2: rKatz = .14,
p < .0001; rRosow­Breslau = .17, p < .0001; rNagi = .13, p <
.0001). After controlling for previously identified demo-
graphic and health predictors of current function (age, sex,
race, education, body mass index, cognitive status, depres-
sion, self-rated health, cancer, heart attack, stroke, diabetes,
hypertension, sleeping difficulties, smoking, and alcohol
use), greater s-VCAM concentrations (log s-VCAM) were
independently related to poorer function as measured by the
Katz (p = .003) and Rosow­Breslau (p = .0003) scales, but
not the Nagi (p = .07). Further, when controlling for IL-6
and d-dimer, s-VCAM remained an independent predictor
of cross-sectional function as measured by the Katz and
Rosow­Breslau scales (p < .02 for both; Table 2). Although
s-VCAM was significantly correlated with IL-6 (r = .13,
p < .0001) and d-dimer (r = .12, p < .0001), these were not
levels that generally raise concerns about collinearity-
induced problems with model estimation. For Nagi- and
Rosow-Breslau­assessed function, there were no signifi-
cant s-VCAM interactions for the individual demographic
(age, race, and gender) or health factors; for Katz-assessed
function, the only significant s-VCAM interaction was for
cognitive status (b [SE] = 0.046 [0.17], p = .006).
Longitudinally, in controlled analyses with or without
d-dimer and IL-6, s-VCAM was not related to functional
status 4 years later, as assessed by Katz, Rosow­Breslau,
or Nagi scales (p > .05 for all). However, 4 years after the
current study baseline assessment, 338 (22%) of 1,551 par-
ticipants were deceased, implying a potential survivor bias
confounding the relation of s-VCAM with function.
Association of Biomarkers With 4- and 15-Year Mortality
In fully controlled analyses, s-VCAM was independently
related to 4-year mortality; this relationship was indepen-
dent of previously identified demographic and health pre-
dictors of mortality, including d-dimer and IL-6 (p < .05;

Figure 1; Table 3). Specifically, with the controlled vari-
ables held constant, over the 4-year period, the relative risk
of death was 20% greater for those with a 1 SD increase in
log s-VCAM concentration (Figure 1; Table 3). For 4-year
mortality, there were no significant s-VCAM interactions
for demographic or health factors.
The Cox proportional hazards assume proportionality,
that is, for the events being modeled, the hazards ratio is
constant over time (33). Here, the test of proportionality
was rejected (p = .007). Relative to the hazard for the
median s-VCAM concentration, the hazard for greater
s-VCAM concentrations was larger during Year 1 than in
any subsequent year after measurement (Figure 2). At base-
line, participants differing by a 1 SD increase in the log of
s-VCAM concentration had 2.75 times the mortality risk.
This decreased to 1.7 times at 3 months, 1.5 times at
6 months, and to 1.25 times at 1 year (Figure 2). After
4 years, there was no increased risk of mortality with asso-
ciated with greater s-VCAM concentrations (Figure 2).
When 15-year mortality for those alive at 4 years was
assessed, and with previously identified demographic and
health predictors of mortality controlled, concentrations
of s-VCAM, IL-6, and d-dimer were not related to mortality
(p > .05 for all; Table 3).
Discussion
Here, function, as measured with the Katz and Rosow­
Breslau measures, was related to s-VCAM independent of
the relations for d-dimer and IL-6. Also, as previously dem-
onstrated, d-dimer and IL-6 concentrations were related to
function, independent of one another (9). Most remarkably,
in a sample of community-dwelling adults 71 years of age
and older, s-VCAM, d-dimer, and IL-6 concentrations were
independently related to mortality within 4 years, even after
functional status and demographic and health status predic-
tors of mortality had been taken into account.
Previous work has implicated s-VCAM as a marker of
endothelial dysfunction associated with reduced survival.
s-VCAM concentrations have been associated with disease-
associated mortality in metastatic gastric cancer (15) and
sickle-cell disease (18) as well as cardiovascular mortality
in coronary artery disease (34) and type 2 diabetes (35).
Although markers of inflammation and coagulation have
been associated previously with declining function and
mortality (3­10,22), to our knowledge, this is the first inves-
tigation linking s-VCAM concentrations to all-cause mor-
tality in a general (not disease-specific) older population
while controlling for the presence of multiple comorbidities
that might account for such an association.
Endothelial dysfunction and decreases in endothelium-
dependent dilation have been associated with aging, in the
absence of overt disease (36,37). Mechanisms have been
attributed to decreases in nitric oxide availability, endothelial
nitric oxide synthase expression, and tetrahydrobiopterin

mediated vascoconstriction, and inflammation (36,37).
Thus, in our cohort of 71+ year olds, elevated s-VCAM
concentrations, independent of disease and inflammation,
might have contributed to decreased function and earlier
mortality by reflecting subclinical vascular dysfunction.
Future investigations are necessary to confirm this hy-
pothesis, as well as to test the effects of attempts to im-
prove endothelial function (exercise, growth hormone, diet,

caloric restriction, etc. [reviewed in 36,37]) on physical
function and mortality.
Although s-VCAM concentrations were predictive of
4-year mortality, this effect was due largely to association of
s-VCAM concentrations with mortality observed during the
first year. This observation highlights several noteworthy
conclusions related to mortality predictions. First, it is
important to verify the assumption of proportionality to
ensure that predictive capability of a marker at a later time
is not due to effects of the marker at initial or early times.
Second, the change in the hazards over time suggests that
either s-VCAM concentrations change dynamically or the
relation between s-VCAM concentrations and mortality is
mutable. The concentrations of IL-6 and d-dimer are stable
within an individual over at least 36 days (38), but these
concentrations, as well as those of s-VCAM, would be
expected to change with the changing health status of an
individual and therefore predict more proximal events.
Third, it is important, but unknown whether additional pre-
dictive capability might be derived from serial longitudinal
measurements of s-VCAM, d-dimer, or IL-6 over time.
Limitations
Because the participants are a subsample of individuals
who survived 6 years after initial enrollment and who had
blood collected, there is a question whether they are repre-
sentatives of the population of community-dwelling adults
71 years and older. As previously reported, those without a
blood draw were typically older and sicker suggesting a
possible ceiling effect on the generalizability of the findings
(4). Also, whereas the long-term follow-up is a strength of

the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of
the Elderly cohort, the lack of shorter follow-up intervals
for a more granular assessment of the temporal course of
function and the relatively small number of deaths within
the first year make it difficult to determine with precision
the time-dependent effect of s-VCAM concentrations on
function and mortality. Further, causal inferences regarding
the impact of greater s-VCAM concentrations on function
and mortality should be interpreted with caution. However,
the consistency of these findings with prior findings of
greater concentrations of s-VCAM in disease populations
(11­16,39,40) supports the face validity of our findings.
Further, the strength of the associations between s-VCAM,
function, and mortality, despite adjustment for multiple
potential confounders, supports our hypothesis that endo-
thelial dysfunction is related to functional decline and
contributes to death in older community-dwelling adults.
Nonetheless, additional investigations designed to prospec-
tively follow s-VCAM concentrations, function, and mor-
tality with greater granularity over time are necessary to
refine an understanding of the time interval over which
s-VCAM can provide informative predictions of mortality
and to determine if s-VCAM is causally related to (a bio-
marker) or merely a risk indicator of declining function and
mortality.
In summary, in this cohort of community-dwelling older
adults, greater blood concentrations of s-VCAM were re-
lated to poorer function and to short-term (1 year) mortality
independent of comorbidities, inflammation, and coagulation
markers. These findings imply that endothelial dysfunction
is potentially a causal contributor to functional decline and
death in elders.
