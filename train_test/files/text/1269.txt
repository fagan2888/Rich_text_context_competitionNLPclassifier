Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, Ethnicity,
and Blood Pressure in the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
Robert Scragg, MaryFran Sowers, and Colin Bell
Background: Populations with low vitamin D status,
such as blacks living in the US or UK, have increased
blood pressure (BP) compared with whites. We analyzed
the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
(25OHD) and BP to determine whether low 25OHD ex-
plains any of the increased BP in blacks.
Methods: The Third US National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III) is a cross-sectional
survey representative of the US civilian population during
1988 to 1994. Analyses were restricted to 12,644 people
aged 20 years with measurements of BP and 25OHD,
after excluding those on hypertensive medication.
Results: Adjusted mean serum 25OHD was lowest in
non-Hispanic blacks (49 nmol/L), intermediate in Mexican
Americans (68 nmol/L), and highest in non-Hispanic
whites (79 nmol/L). When participants were divided into
25OHD quintiles, mean (standard error) systolic BP was
3.0 (0.7) mm Hg lower (P  .0004) and diastolic BP was
1.6 (0.6) mm Hg lower (P  .011) for participants in the
highest quintile (25OHD 85.7 nmol/L) compared with
the lowest (25OHD 40.4 nmol/L), adjusting for age, sex,
ethnicity, and physical activity. Further adjustment for
body mass index (BMI) weakened the inverse association
between 25OHD and BP, which remained significant for
systolic BP (P  .05). The inverse association between
25OHD and systolic BP was stronger in participants aged
50 years than younger (P  .021). Ethnic differences in
25OHD explained about half of the increased hypertension
prevalence in non-Hispanic blacks compared with whites.
Conclusions: Vitamin D status, which is amenable to
intervention by safely increasing sun exposure or vitamin
D supplementation, was associated inversely with BP in a
large sample representative of the US population. Am J

Alterations in calcium metabolism are known to
influence blood pressure (BP) regulation.1,2 Cal-
ciotropic hormones, including vitamin D, may
have a role in this regulation.3,4 A receptor to 1,25-dihy-
droxyvitamin D has been described in smooth muscle
tissue, supporting a potential role for vitamin D in the
regulation of smooth muscle contraction, and therefore
BP.5 A positive association between serum 25-hydroxyvi-
tamin D (25OHD), which is increased in vitamin D defi-
ciency, and BP has been reported in a US study.6
Ultraviolet B radiation, the main source of vitamin D,
has been shown to lower BP in Poles7 and in Germans
with mild untreated hypertension,8 although serum levels
of sun-induced 25-hydroxyvitamin D3
were similar in
newly detected hypertensive cases compared with matched
controls in New Zealand.9
The possibility that vitamin D status is inversely related
to BP may explain some of the well-known regional and
ethnic variations in hypertension.10,11 Blood pressure is
higher in American and British blacks compared with
whites.12,13 These ethnic differences in BP are consistent
with low levels of vitamin D in blacks,14 because of
decreased skin synthesis secondary to increased skin pig-
mentation,15 compared with whites.
The recent National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) measured serum vitamin D status
and BP in a sample representative of the US population. A
previous short report, limited to fasting participants attend-
ing the morning examination of NHANES III (n  8421),
failed to detect a significant association between serum
25OHD and adjusted odds ratios of hypertension, analyzed
as one component of the metabolic syndrome.16 It is also

unclear from this report whether participants with treated
hypertension were excluded from statistical analyses. The
current article analyzes a larger sample of NHANES III
participants (both fasting and nonfasting) to increase sta-
tistical power, after excluding those on treatment for hy-
pertension to avoid possible bias from treatment effects.
The specific aims are to examine: (1) whether vitamin D is
inversely related to both systolic and diastolic BP; and, if
so, (2) whether ethnic differences in vitamin D status
explain any ethnic difference in BP.
Methods
The NHANES III is a cross-sectional survey representa-
tive of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population
carried out during 1988 to 1994 by the National Center for
Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. A stratified, multistage sampling design was
used to recruit participants from household clusters, with
oversampling of non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Amer-
icans. After an initial interview at home, participants vis-
ited mobile centers, where they had an extensive physical
examination. Full details of all survey methods, including
sampling, interview, examination, laboratory measure-
ment of blood samples, ethical approval, and informed
consent, have been published.17
Study Population
A total of 23,258 adults, aged 20 years, were invited to
take part in the survey. Of these 18,825 were interviewed
at home, 16,573 of whom attended mobile examination
centers. In the home interview, information was collected
on a wide range of variables including: age, sex, ethnicity
(self-assigned as either non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Mexican American, other), past history of ever
being told by a physician or other health professional of
having hypertension, and the number of times a range of
common physical activities was undertaken in leisure time
during the previous month.17 Metabolic equivalents
(MET) were assigned for each physical activity, and par-
ticipants aged 60 years were classified as doing moder-
ate or vigorous activities if the MET for any activity was
3.0 or 6.0, respectively, whereas those aged 20 to 59
years were similarly classified if the MET for any activity
was 3.5 or 7.0, respectively.18
At the mobile examination centers, participants were
dressed in underpants, disposable light clothing, and slip-
pers while being weighed on electronic scales in kilo-
grams, to two decimal places. Height was measured with
a fixed stadiometer to the nearest millimeter.17 Body mass
index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms di-
vided by the square of height in meters. The date of the
examination, by calendar month, was used to account for
seasonal variation in sun exposure.
Blood pressure was measured at the mobile examina-
tion centers by physicians with mercury sphygmomanom-
eters using a standard protocol.17 Up to three measurements
were collected from each participant while in the sitting
position, and if more than two measurements were col-
lected, the last two were averaged. Systolic BP was de-
fined as the point at which the first Korotkoff sound was
heard; the diastolic BP was the level of mercury 2 mm
below where the last sound was heard. Hypertension was
defined as systolic 140 mm Hg or diastolic 90 mm Hg.12
Pulse pressure was calculated as the difference between
systolic and diastolic pressures.19
Blood samples collected during the examination were
centrifuged, aliquoted, and frozen to 70°C on site, and
shipped on dry ice to central laboratories where they were
stored at 70°C until analysis.17 Serum 25OHD was
measured by a radioimmunoassay kit after extraction with
acetonitrile (DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN) by the National
Center for Environmental Health, CDC, Atlanta, GA. Se-
rum 25OHD concentrations ranged from 8.7 to 243.6
nmol/L after excluding one person with a 25OHD value of
400.1 nmol/L.
Data in this report are restricted to non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, and Mexican-American adults 20
years who attended the mobile examination centers (n 
12,644), after excluding those who were on current treat-
ment for hypertension (n  2649), had no serum 25OHD
measurement (n  664), had no BP measurement (n 
28), had no BMI measurement (n  25), or were of
"other" nationalities (n  563).
Statistical analyses were carried out with SUDAAN
(version 9.0.0; Research Triangle Park, NC), using the
sampling weights for the mobile examination centers to
adjust for oversampling of non-Hispanic blacks and Mex-
ican Americans, and to correct standard errors for any
design effect arising from clustered sampling. PROC
REGRESS was used to calculate adjusted means and
regression coefficients, whereas PROC CROSSTAB was
used to calculate adjusted relative risks.
Results
Adjusted mean serum 25OHD concentrations varied be-
tween categories of demographic and lifestyle variables
(Table 1). Vitamin D was higher in men than in women
and declined with increasing age. With regard to ethnicity,
vitamin D was lowest in non-Hispanic blacks, intermedi-
ate in Mexican Americans, and highest in non-Hispanic
whites. Mean level of 25OHD decreased with increasing
BMI quintile. Vitamin D concentrations were lowest in
participants who did no leisure-time physical activity dur-
ing the previous month, compared with those who were
physically active, and increased in a stepwise fashion with
increasing frequency of activity. The expected seasonal
variation in 25OHD was also present, with levels being
lowest in January to April and highest in July to October,
after adjusting for covariates. Mean serum 25OHD was
similar for participants who had ever been told by a
physician they had hypertension, but were not on current
antihypertensive medication, and those who had never

VITAMIN D, ETHNICITY, AND BLOOD PRESSURE
been told they have hypertension, indicating that this vari-
able was not related to vitamin D status. Hence, it was not
adjusted for in further analyses.
Mean BP varied inversely with vitamin D status, with
systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure each being signifi-
cantly (P  .05) lower in the highest quintile of serum
25OHD (85.7 nmol/L) compared with the lowest quin-
tile (40.4 nmol/L) after adjusting for age, sex, ethnic-
ity, and leisure-time physical activity (Table 2).
However, further adjustment for BMI attenuated BP dif-
ferences; therefore, only systolic BP and pulse pressure
varied significantly (P  .05) between vitamin D quintiles
(Table 2). In contrast, adding serum calcium to the model
had little effect on the BP differences between vitamin D
quintiles, indicating that the inverse association between
serum 25OHD and BP is independent of serum calcium.
Mean serum 25OHD levels did not vary (P  .09) be-
tween hypertensive cases (72.9 nmol/L) and controls (75.6
nmol/L), adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity, indicating
that cases and controls had overlapping 25OHD distribu-
tions.
Possible effect modification of the relationship between
BP and serum 25OHD was examined with multiple re-
gression analyses using BP as a continuous variable. In-
verse associations between BP and 25OHD existed in
all ethnic groups. Coefficients (SE) from regressing BP
(mm Hg) as the dependent variable against serum 25OHD
(nmol/L), adjusting for age, sex, and leisure-time physical
activity were: for systolic BP, 0.022 (P  .0017) in
non-Hispanic whites, 0.024 (P  .09) in non-Hispanic
blacks, and 0.031 (P  .0024) in Mexican Americans;
and for diastolic BP, 0.015 (P  .0060) in non-Hispanic
whites, 0.018 (P  .09) in non-Hispanic blacks, and
0.030 (P  .0004) in Mexican Americans.
However, the association between BP and serum
25OHD varied with age after adjusting for sex, ethnicity,
and leisure-time physical activity (Table 3). Regression
models were run with serum 25OHD and a product term of
25OHD times a dummy variable for age (50 years  1,
50 years  0). In these models, serum 25OHD was
inversely associated with both systolic and diastolic BP
but not with pulse pressure (P  .56). In addition, there
were significant (P  .05) negative age interactions for
systolic BP and pulse pressure, indicating that these two
measures of BP decreased more with increasing 25OHD in
people 50 years of age compared with younger partici-
pants. Calculations based on these coefficients indicate
that increasing serum 25OHD from 20 to 100 nmol/L

predicts, in people aged 50 and 50 years, respectively,
a decrease of 1.8 mm Hg and 4.6 mm Hg in systolic BP,
a decrease of 2.1 mm Hg and 0.8 mm Hg in diastolic BP,
and an increase of 0.3 mm Hg and a decrease of 3.8 mm
Hg in pulse pressure.
Ethnic-specific mean BPs are shown in Table 4. Within
each gender, non-Hispanic blacks had higher age-adjusted
systolic and diastolic BPs than Mexican Americans and
non-Hispanic whites, whereas Mexican Americans had
BPs similar to non-Hispanic whites, except for a higher
systolic BP in women. Mean pulse pressure was also
higher in non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans
compared with non-Hispanic whites.
The contribution of ethnic differences in vitamin D
status to the ethnic variations in systolic BP is shown in
Figs. 1 and 2. The mean difference in systolic BP was 3.5
mm Hg among non-Hispanic blacks and 1.4 mm Hg
among Mexican Americans compared with non-Hispanic
whites, after adjusting for age and sex. When quintile of
vitamin D or BMI was added to the model, the mean
difference in systolic BP among non-Hispanic blacks de-
creased more for 25OHD (to 2.1 mm Hg) than for BMI (to
2.7 mm Hg), indicating that ethnic variations in vitamin D
explained more of the increased systolic BP in non-His-
panic blacks (about one-third) than ethnic differences in
BMI, which explained about one-fifth. When both vitamin
D and BMI were adjusted for, the mean difference (1.9
mm Hg) was similar to adjusting for vitamin D alone,
indicating that their effects were not additive. The same
pattern was seen for diastolic BP and pulse pressure (data
not shown). In contrast, the addition of vitamin D and BMI
to the model had similar effects on the difference in BP
between Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites,
and their effects were additive, as there was only a very

VITAMIN D, ETHNICITY, AND BLOOD PRESSURE
small mean ethnic difference (0.1 mm Hg) after adjusting
for both variables (Fig. 1).
When the relative risk of hypertension compared with
non-Hispanic whites was calculated, for non-Hispanic
blacks it decreased from 1.93 (95% CI 1.55, 2.41), adjust-
ing for age and sex, to 1.40 (95% CI 1.04, 1.89), adjusting
also for vitamin D, and 1.66 (95% CI 1.34, 2.07), adjusting
also for BMI. For Mexican Americans relative to non-
Hispanic whites, the relative risk of hypertension de-
creased from 1.11 (95% CI 0.84, 1.46), adjusting for age
and sex, to 0.98 (95% CI 0.72, 1.33), adjusting for vitamin
D, and 0.97 (95% CI 0.73, 1.15), adjusting for BMI. This
indicates that ethnic differences in vitamin D explain about
half of the increased prevalence of hypertension in non-
Hispanic blacks compared with non-Hispanic whites.
Discussion
These results from a nationally representative US sample
show that systolic BP and pulse pressure are inversely
associated with serum 25OHD. Although the differences
we observed in BP between vitamin D quintiles are small,
the random measurement error arising from measuring BP
at a single interview, and from a single measurement of
vitamin D status using a blood sample collected at the
same interview, is likely to have resulted in attenuation of
the observed association between these two variables.20

Moreover, the vitamin D­related BP differences reported
in this article have public health significance, as a 2 to 3
mm Hg decrease in systolic BP would produce an approx-
imate 10% to 15% decline in cardiovascular mortality.20
The inverse association between serum 25OHD and
systolic BP has clinical significance, because the latter
variable is a better predictor of coronary heart disease risk
than diastolic BP, particularly in older people.21 The in-
verse association between serum 25OHD and pulse pres-
sure suggests that vitamin D may lower systolic BP by
increasing arterial compliance.19 This may occur through
serum 25OHD­dependent autocrine production of 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D in vascular smooth muscle cells,
which inhibits smooth muscle cell growth,22 or through
the influence of parathyroid hormone (which is increased by
vitamin D deficiency),11 or by direct suppression of the
renin-angiotensin system.3,23
The interpretation of the significance of our 25OHD
findings depends on whether it is appropriate to include
BMI as a confounder, or whether the latter is an interme-
diary in the causal pathway linking vitamin D and BP and
therefore should not be adjusted when evaluating the full
effect of vitamin D. The reduced serum 25OHD level for
participants in the high BMI quintiles (Table 1) is proba-
bly due to sequestering of vitamin D within the increased
fat mass of obese people.24 However, there is also evi-
dence that low vitamin D status, by causing parathyroid
hormone (PTH) excess and calcium influx into adipocytes,
may promote weight gain.25
In addition to the possibility of random measurement
error weakening the observed inverse association between
serum 25OHD and BP, other limitations of this study
include its cross-sectional design, which cannot separate
cause and effect, and the possibility of other lifestyle
variables (in addition to physical activity and obesity)
associated with vitamin D status, confounding the associ-
ation between vitamin D and BP.
Although our findings are consistent with previous
studies of ultraviolet B radiation and BP,7,8 they contrast
with some previous observational studies of dietary vita-
min D, which provides only part of the supply to humans.
The oral vitamin D studies have shown inconsistent re-
sults, with an inverse association being observed between
systolic BP and oral intake of vitamin D in Iowa womens26
but not in a recent analysis of three US cohorts.27 Supple-
mentation with a vitamin D analog (-calcidol) has been
shown to lower BP in patients with impaired glucose
tolerance in Sweden,28 but supplementation with vitamin
D3
did not lower BP in elderly men and women in
England.29 The likely explanation for the failure of the
latter study to lower BP may be insufficient change of
vitamin D in the treated group. For example, the English
study only increased 25OHD levels by 52% from 34 to 52
nmol/L.29 In contrast, 25OHD levels more than doubled
from 25.7 to 64.8 nmol/L among the treated group in a
German study, which observed a significant reduction in
both systolic BP and pulse rate.30
Age- and gender-adjusted mean BPs were higher in
non-Hispanic blacks than in Mexican Americans and non-
Hispanic whites, consistent with results from the first
phase (1988 to 1991) of NHANES III.13 The finding that
ethnic differences in vitamin D status explained about half
of the increased prevalence of hypertension in non-His-
panic blacks, compared with non-Hispanic whites, sup-
ports the previous suggestion that low vitamin D levels in
non-Hispanic blacks may be a factor in their increased
hypertension prevalence.10,11 Ethnic differences in BMI
also made a small contribution to the increased risk of
hypertension in both non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican
Americans compared with non-Hispanic whites. Other
lifestyle factors not analyzed in this article, such as low
intake of potassium and high intake of sodium, may
contribute to the increased BP levels in non-Hispanic
blacks,31 whereas the contribution of genetic factors to
ethnic differences is probably modest compared with the
role of lifestyle.32
In summary, we have found increased systolic BP in
people with low serum 25OHD levels in a representative
US sample. This finding may have public health signifi-
cance, as vitamin D levels can easily, and cheaply, be
increased by a modest increase in sun exposure or vitamin
D supplementation. However, first it needs to be con-
firmed by large, well-designed intervention studies.
