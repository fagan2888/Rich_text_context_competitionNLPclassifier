The state of the American public high school in urban com-
munities is a matter of great concern for parents, students,
educators, and policy makers. Urban high schools are
plagued by high drop-out rates, increased violence, low
achievement levels, low levels of student engagement, and
inequitable standards (Cotton, 1996; Fine, 1991; Fowler,
1995; Howley, 1994; White, 1982). As a result, increasing
numbers of large public urban districts are seeking more effi-
cient alternatives to the traditional comprehensive high
school.
In response to this problem, high schools across the coun-
try are focusing on reorganizing into smaller learning com-
munities. Research conducted over the past 20 years supports
that small schools are better for students academically, and
they are safer too (Supovitz & Christman, 2003). This "small
is better" reform movement has concluded that smaller high
schools have better attendance and performance on reading
and writing assessments, and higher graduation and college-
going rates, despite serving a more educationally disadvan-
taged population of students (Bryk, Easton, Gladden,
Kochanek, & Luppescu, 1999; Howley, 2002; Lee & Smith,
1994; Lee, Smith, & Croniger, 1995; Mitchell, 2000).
The Small Schools Movement
The small schools movement is described by Meier (2002),
founder of one of the first and most successful small schools
in Harlem, as a cultural rather than an institutional change.
The small schools movement is about relationships and cre-
ating a culture in which students, teachers, families, and
community members are known to each other (Klonsky,
2000). Ayers (2000) wrote,
The large, factory model school has its own kind of culture. It is
a default culture. It exists because nothing else has consciously
been put in its place. This culture parodies what is most absurd,
most unjust, and most cruel about society at large. (p. 99)
While the majority of school improvement strategies
today focus on increased performance and standardization,
small school restructuring efforts attempt to redefine school-
ing as a relational enterprise focusing on the unique needs of
individuals and communities.
Small School Research
Small school research began with several large-scale quanti-
tative studies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These studies

Small School Reform: The Challenges
Faced by One Urban High School
Carroll E. Bronson1
Abstract
This qualitative ethnographic case study explored the evolution of a public urban high school in its 3rd year of small school
reform. The study focused on how the high school proceeded from its initial concept, moving to a small school program,
and emerging as a new small high school. Data collection included interviews, observations, and document review to develop
a case study of one small high school sharing a multiplex building. The first key finding, "Too Many Pieces, Not Enough
Glue," revealed that the school had too many new programs starting at once and they lacked a clear understanding of
their concept and vision for their new small school, training on the Montessori philosophies, teaching and learning in small
schools, and how to operate within a teacher-cooperative model. The second key finding, "A Continuous Struggle," revealed
that the shared building space presented problems for teachers and students. District policies remain unchanged, resulting
in staff and students resorting to activist approaches to get things done. These findings offer small school reform leaders
suggestions for developing and sustaining a small school culture and cohesion despite the pressures to revert back to top-
down, comprehensive high school norms.

confirmed educators' assumptions that small schools make
educational achievements possible; students stay in school,
know their teachers better, and are achieving academic-
ally (Fowler, 1995; Howley, 1994; Visher, Emanuel, &
Teitelbaum, 1999). According to the research, small schools
generally enroll no more than 400 students (Bearman &
Ahmed, 2012; Cotton, 1996; Dentith, Bronson, Beachum, &
Schneider, 2007; Fine, 2005; Meier, 2005; Wasley & Lear,
2001) and counteract the problems faced in larger schools,
such as overburdened teachers who struggle to keep up or
inadequate supports for students who need extracurricular
help (Cotton, 1996; Heard, 2002; Howley, Strange, & Bickel,
2000). Smaller environments promote meaningful relation-
ships between staff and students, which is thought to lead to
more success for students in academics and personal
endeavors.
Cotton (1996) reviewed more than 103 documents that
identified a relationship between school size and some other
aspect of schooling. According to her results, students in
small high schools score higher on tests, pass more courses,
and go on to college more frequently than those in larger
ones. Moreover, Cotton suggests that these results appear to
be greater for low-income students and students of color:
Poor students and those of racial and ethnic minorities are more
adversely affected academically, attitudinally, and behaviorally,
by attending large schools than are other students. Unfortunately,
poor and minority students continue to be concentrated in large
schools. (p. 11)
The research on small schools has recently shifted from
demonstrating the benefits of small school size to looking for
best practices within restructured or newly formed small
schools. The literature has begun to inform educational
reformers the ways in which they can take advantage of the
smallness of their own schools. Copeland and Boatright's
(2004) research suggests that small schools offer the oppor-
tunity for leadership practices to emerge that strengthen
interpersonal relationships between adults and students, and
build professional communities that are focused on the
improvement of teaching and learning for everyone. Reports
from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation examine issues
of initiating and maintaining successful small school reform,
and ways to identify barriers to sustaining thriving small
schools (Hendrie, 2004). One of the key barriers mentioned
is finding enough principals and teachers who truly under-
stand the complex features of successful small schools:
"Many small schools are struggling to put into place strong
curricula and instructional practices, in part because their
detracted classrooms include students of widely varying skill
levels" (p. 30). The article also discusses the difficulty in
renovating large buildings at a "time of overcrowding and
tight budgets" which "pose other serious roadblocks" (p. 30).
Darling-Hammond (1997) commented, "There's a big debate
in the reform community on whether it's even worth the
effort to try to convert large high schools as they are, or
whether only useful strategy is to go to new, small, com-
pletely autonomous schools" (p. 31). Currently, there is little
research available that supports either approach as better
than the other.
The positive effects of small schools are attributed to the
fact that small schools foster school communities that focus
on teaching and learning (Ancess, 1997, 2003; Cotton, 1996).
Although individual factors related to school effectiveness
have been explored, little is known about the evolution of
small schools--how organizational and leadership change is
experienced in the newly configured small high schools.
Insights into a relatively new phenomenon of such complex-
ity can best be acquired through in-depth investigation of a
particular site through an analysis of these relationships as
part of a sustained inquiry.
This study attempted to contribute to the knowledge base
by exploring and analyzing the evolution of an urban small
high school in its 3rd year of reform in a large multiplex.
This ethnographic case study reports on issues of organiza-
tional change through focused attention on the altered roles
of the teachers and administrators, as well as their relation-
ships with each other and with the central administration
office. Moreover, this study describes the complexity of
shared spaces within a multiplex structure and discusses the
repercussions this arrangement has on its students and school
leaders within this large midwestern school district.
Theoretical Framework
Restructuring a large high school into a smaller learning
community is a challenging process. Schools undergo this
transformation because their current structure is failing.
However, creating successful small high schools needs more
than just small numbers of students (Cotton, 1996; Howley
et al., 2000; Wallach, 2010). Personal relationships, unique
curriculums, and alternate assessments are a few of the com-
ponents that are needed as well (Ancess, 2003; Cotton, 1996;
Heard, 2002; Klonsky, 2000; Oxley, 1994; Ravitz, 2010;
Wasley et al., 2000). Although these components are more
easily achieved in smaller schools, they are not an automatic
result of a smaller school and must be worked for instead.
Fine's (2005) research suggests that dividing large schools
into smaller units is a step in the right direction, but simply
dividing or "fracturing" current structures would not ensure
success. Newly created small high schools must be supported
by districts, states, and local communities or they will have
trouble surviving (Cotton, 1996; Howley, 2002). The small
schools movement was meant to reclaim the public sphere
and reinvigorate public education with a commitment that
would inspire, spread to, and support other schools (Darling-
Hammond, 1997; Fine, 2005). Keeping the intention of the
small schools movement clear is vital to its success.
Bronson 3
Based on the Bank Street research project in Chicago,
Fine (2005) contended that small schools were established to
provide students:
Access, participation and democracy: Educators craft
elaborate plans for curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment to
nurture the minds and souls of youth. They build democratic
participation into the fabric of schools and communities.
Commitments to equity: While small schools vary in theme,
origin, and structure, at their best they are designed to encourage
sustained, critical inquiry among heterogeneous groups of youth
who are being educated toward college.
Sophisticated systems of assessment that support better
teaching and learning: The small schools movement has
historically resisted high-stakes tests and externally generated
assessments as fundamentally anti-intellectual.
Schools for social justice and social responsibility: Defining
schools as public institutions with deep social responsibilities
for intellectual, economic, and civic well-being, many in the
small schools movement originally conceived the schools as a
movement for educational justice. (pp. 12-14)
These ideas emphasize the original intent of small schools
and these findings foreshadow the focus of this research
project, providing the conceptual orientation of the proposed
study. These concepts have provided a framing lens through
which to better understand the phenomena of small school
reform. The following section describes the methods and
data collection for the study.
Methods and Data Collection
This yearlong ethnographic case study conducted in 2009
marked an attempt to explore how one urban high school, a
new small high school housed in a multiplex, evolved from a
concept, to a program, and finally to a new small high school.
This case study design used qualitative strategies of data col-
lection. Field data were collected through school site obser-
vations, document analysis, and 25 individual interviews.
The researcher observed general leadership meetings with all
staff members, department team meetings with teachers,
administrator meetings with parents on discipline issues, and
general staff development sessions. The researcher inter-
viewed administrators and teachers, as well as observing stu-
dents, classrooms, hallways, principal or other school
leader's offices, the cafeteria, and other events.
Data were managed and organized through the use of
NVivo, a qualitative research software program. NVivo sup-
ports the ways in which researchers work with their data. The
computer's capacity for recording, sorting, matching, and
linking can be directed by the researchers to assist in answer-
ing their research questions from the data, without losing
access to the source data, or the original context of the data.
The researchers produced node reports and conducted rela-
tional mapping through intersection and union of identified
nodes relative to the research questions.
Data Analysis
The analysis followed generally accepted forms of qualita-
tive inquiry and relied on the research questions to guide the
data collection, analysis, and reporting of the ethnographic
case study findings. Data analysis was an ongoing, continu-
ous process in this qualitative study. According to Merriam
(2009), "Making sense out of the data involves consolidat-
ing, reducing, and interpreting what people have said and
what the researcher has seen and read--it is the process of
making meaning" (pp. 175-176). The data analysis process
began simultaneously with data collection. The researcher
reflected on observations, analytic memos, field notes, and
interview data independently. Patterns were identified and
initial codes were determined after multiply readings. By
examining the complexity of these different categories, the
researcher began to see an emerging picture of how an urban
high school experienced its evolution. More specifically,
several internal and external factors emerged that affected
the school's development.
This study addressed two overarching questions:
1. In what ways have the original ideas behind this new
small high school in an urban setting evolved and
taken shape from its initial concept, to a program, to
a new small high school?
2. In what ways, if any, have the internal (leadership,
building space, curriculum, and school identity) or
external factors (funding, local or state support, and
parent support) of this school affected its evolution?
The following section provides the context for the research
study.
Context of the Study
The United States has been entrenched in cycles of school
reform for more than 100 years. In Grassmore1 the most
recent wave of large-scale high school reform, called
Weston's2 High School Redesign Initiative, was imple-
mented in the fall of 2003, with a grant from the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation in the amount of US$17,250,000.
The grant outlined a 5-year plan to redesign Weston's large
comprehensive public high schools by developing small
autonomous high schools throughout the city, with the goal
of helping students graduate from high school prepared for
college and the workforce, and ready to be productive and
contributing members of society.
Weston's High School Redesign Initiative suggested that
new small high schools should be in their own building or
share space in a multiplex (an old large high school housing
4 SAGE Open
three or more separate schools). New small high schools
should be autonomous with a specific mission and specific
objectives for success. The goal in Weston was to have
schools throughout the area offer parents and students choice
in approaches to curriculum, teaching methodology, and
classroom structures. In addition, there would be schools that
keep at-risk students from disengaging from the learning
process by offering counseling, personal attention, and sup-
port in addition to an innovative curriculum.
Federal accountability standards driven by the No Child
Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) demand that systematic
change occur in secondary education around the country.
Weston's comprehensive high schools have been identified
as schools in need of improvement and are therefore subject
to rigorous federal sanctions that could lead to school recon-
stitution. Due to the grim statistics facing them, leaders
throughout Weston have mobilized efforts to address the
challenges of NCLB and the need to improve high school
attendance, performance, and graduation rates by imple-
menting a small high school design. It is estimated that
15,000 students were affected by this comprehensive reform
effort between the years 2003 and 2008. Within the Weston
Public School (WPS) system, 7,000 students were served in
multiplex facilities located in reconfigured large WPS high
schools and 6,000 students in 30 or more newly created small
schools. According to a report issued by the National
Assessment of Education Progress, a testing program of the
federal government often called The Nations' Report Card,
Weston had the most dramatic negative results regarding the
achievement gap figures (Borsuk, 2008). These figures sug-
gested that other larger issues than education are affecting
the lives of African Americans in Weston. The report sug-
gested that rising poverty, loss of blue-collar jobs, high rates
of single-parent households, increased numbers of teen
births, and severe crime are a few issues affecting African
American students and the Weston community at large.
Undeniably, action needed to be taken given the state sta-
tistics on school performance in Grassmore. On average,
43.1% of students graduate from an urban high school in
Grassmore compared with the U.S. national average of 70%
(Toppo, 2006). The statistics in Weston, the city in which this
study is focused, are even more staggering as there is a large
disparity between the inner-city schools and their surround-
ing suburbs. In Weston, 82.5% of students graduate from
suburban schools while only 54.5% graduate from urban
schools (Thomas, 2008). The 28% disparity in Weston is the
10th-largest among cities in the United States.
WPS District
At the time of the study in 2009, WPS District was the
largest school district in its midwestern state and is the
27th largest school district in the country. It served more
than 100,000 students in more than 200 schools around the
city. In 2006, 75% of the WPS students received free or
reduced lunch, the measure used to indicate student pov-
erty, which has grown from 69% a decade ago (Borsuk,
2007). The number of students with disabilities has
increased as well from 14.6% in 2002 to 16.6% in 2006
(Borsuk, 2007).
In WPS, 90% of high school­age students attend 15 large
comprehensive high schools with an average enrollment of
more than 1,300 students. Student proficiency and gradua-
tion rates in these schools are extremely low. One of every
four WPS high school students fails to pass enough courses
and earn enough credits to move to the next grade level the
following year. One of every three freshmen fails to advance
to sophomore status the next year. The average high school
student attendance rate is only 80% (Borsuk, 2007). Student
mobility rates are also high with nearly one of every three
high school students changing schools every year. On aver-
age, students who dropped out of WPS have attended four
high schools before leaving the system. Over the past several
years, the average grade point average (GPA) for high school
students was 1.8 (D+) and one third of the students failed all
of their courses. The 2004-2005 district graduation rates
were 65%, and the suspension rate for high school students
was 41% (Borsuk, 2007). The small school strategy is clearly
an important one in Weston; currently, 18% of the high
school graduates come from small high schools, even though
these schools enroll only 10% of the WPS high school stu-
dent population and represent 4% of the WPS high school
budget.
In 2003-2004, the Weston Superintendent received
approximately 75 new proposals for 30 new schools set to
open in the fall of 2006. The goal was to plan and create
more than 30 new small schools for approximately 3,000
WPS students by converting at least 7 large schools into mul-
tiplexes serving 7,000 students and new small schools (400
students or less) serving 6,000 students. The school focused
on for this study, Summit High School, is one of the new
small schools mentioned above, and it opened in August
2006, joining three other new small high schools in a multi-
plex building.
Findings
The research project on small high school reform has pro-
duced several distinct findings that are organized here under
two broader dilemmas of practice in contemporary urban
schooling:
1. Key finding--Too many pieces, not enough glue:
Summit High School did not have a successful evolu-
tion from vision to reality. Its founders had too many
new initiatives starting at once. They lacked a clear
understanding of the concept and vision for their new
small school. Staff lacked training on the curriculum
philosophies, teaching and learning in small schools,
and operating within a teacher-cooperative model.
Bronson 5
2. Key Finding--A continuous struggle: Internal and
external factors hindered the development of Summit
High School. The shared building space presented
many problems for the teachers and students at
Summit High School. District policies remain
unchanged, resulting in staff and students resorting to
activist approaches to get things done for their school.
In the sections that follow, the findings are discussed with
an attention to this backdrop and the articulated dilemmas
present in an urban high school setting.
Key Finding: Too Many Pieces, Not Enough Glue
School Concept.The practice of a shared concept involves
developing "pictures of the future" that foster genuine com-
mitment and enrollment rather than compliance (Senge,
2006, p. 9). According to Senge (2006), dictating a vision
will never work, rather people will excel and learn when they
want to. The original founders of Summit High School,3
Cathy, Dave, and Barb, had good intentions when they began
planning their new small school. Their vision and mission
statement was clearly defined on paper, but they had trouble
figuring out how to make it a reality within the school
building.
When Summit High School first opened in 2005, the staff
was faced with multiple challenges and spent many hours
just trying to get things done. None of the teachers had been
principals, received any formal leadership training, or had
the equivalent administrative licenses. Understanding how to
enroll students, deal with district policies, and handle bud-
gets was all new to this staff. Quite frankly, the staff, a group
of teachers who cared about their school and were trying to
make it work, was overworked and overwhelmed.
Summit High School's initial small school proposal
described the advantages of combining two unique curricu-
lumphilosophies,MontessoriandInternationalBaccalaureate
(IB), stating that the rigor of the IB program coupled with
Montessori's concept of creating a lifelong love of learning
was a unique mix that would enhance academic achieve-
ment, increase family involvement, and develop character
(school document, January 2, 2003). Montessori is a unique
curriculum with specific features that teachers need to be
sufficiently trained so that they can incorporate these princi-
ples into their own teaching and learning practices. Even
though Summit provided a few initial professional develop-
ment sessions centered on Montessori philosophies, these
few hours of seminar sessions were not enough to assist
teachers in incorporating these philosophies into their
curriculum.
Moreover, the lack of clarity around the school concept
was evident during the planning stages of Summit High
School, and even through the early years of the school's exis-
tence. This contributed to the school remaining stagnant.
Many staff did not know if they would be required to go to
Montessori training over the summer, which would be a
6-week commitment out-of-state. Barb knew how difficult it
would be to recruit teachers, and then tell them that they had
to attend out-of-state training, so she continued to tell new
hires that the training was "optional." Many teachers who
did not want to continue in the Montessori philosophy or
attend the training left the school, which resulted in high
turnover the first few years.
In 2006, Summit High School made another important
decision and applied for and received Charter status with
WPS District. This decision was made to "trade a higher
level of accountability for a higher level of autonomy"
(school document, January 5, 2007). The staff believed that
changing the school's status would benefit them in several
ways, including more local control over finances, flexibility
in scheduling and school calendar, assessment practices that
match the school's vision and mission, and the opportunity to
supplement nutritional services with locally grown healthy
food.
Another reason that Summit High School decided to
apply for Charter status was their leadership model. From the
beginning, Summit High School operated as a teacher-
cooperative model and teachers collectively shared in the
decision-making process. However, as a non-Charter school,
they were required to maintain a 5% principal appointment,
and this appointment carried more weight in terms of deci-
sion making than the school's founders originally realized.
Essentially, the 5% principal had the authority to overrule or
change any decision made by the group. Even though this
never did happen, this change would protect the work they
had started, and Charter status would allow the group to
function as a recognized, structured teacher-cooperative
model.
Montessori Knowledge and Training. Small schools originated
as creative places where teachers have a clear idea of the
professional culture they want to nurture. "Relevant curricu-
lums and assessments should ideally grow out of that culture,
and teachers should have the flexibility to develop unique
curriculums, methodologies, and assessments appropriate to
their students" (Cook & Tashlik, 2005, p. 15). The objective
is to develop curriculum that challenges and promotes criti-
cal inquiry in a student body. The lack of teachers trained in
Montessori principles was a major issue that Summit needed
to overcome. At the time of the study, only 3 staff members
(Cathy, Dave, and Barb) were trained in Montessori princi-
ples and had certification. That left 12 teachers without suf-
ficient tools to implement the Montessori philosophy into
their daily curriculum.
The Montessori training program required a large finan-
cial commitment from the school and a large time commit-
ment from the teachers. The closest training site was located
in Ohio and required attendees to stay for a period of 6
weeks. Dave explains why teachers were not sent their 1st
year of employment:
6 SAGE Open
What we learned is that it is best to bring teachers on, have them
teach with us for a year, kind of get their feet wet and you know
kind of absorb the lesson and the integrated teaching style. Then
after their first year, go to the 6-week adolescent training. Going
in cold without really knowing what's going on is difficult and
plus for our school, it's a $6,000 investment. (D. Segal, personal
communication, April 6, 2009)
Summit High School, in some respects, took a big risk
hiring candidates without discussing the training commit-
ment in advance. Staff members who are not trained in a par-
ticular curriculum focus will not be able to incorporate the
method effectively into their own teaching and learning ped-
agogy. Interestingly, all seven of the recently hired staff
members are single, and new to the teaching profession.
The Leadership Model. One of the main objectives of small
school reform is to allow smaller schools the ability to create
leadership models in which leadership is distributed across
the staff, instead of being centered on one person. Summit
High School struggled with its leadership model, and how
that leadership model fit in with the rest of the multiplex.
None of the staff was a trained administrator, so running and
leading a school was a new experience. Not only were staff
members trying to figure out how to run and manage their
own school but they also needed to operate within the build-
ing council, which was a group of principals representing the
other small schools, housed in the Summit multiplex.
Building Council.The building council meetings were estab-
lished as a method of joint decision making for the entire
multiplex. The goal was for leadership to be shared among
many participants, but the reality was that the decisions were
made by only a few leaders. The building council reverted to
a hierarchical pattern of leadership, similar to that of schools
operating with a principal. This pattern prevented some
teachers, especially from Summit, from participating more in
building-wide programs and events.
This lack of communication between the building leaders
resulted in whole building programs usually falling through.
Collaborating on programs within the multiplex would have
helped create more unity between the small schools. If the
schools felt more connected and more like a community,
rivalries between the school programs and the students of
different schools might have decreased. Summit High School
teachers were trying to negotiate within this new arena with-
out proper training from the district, or help from the more
seasoned leaders from the other schools. Summit High
School staff members were left on their own to figure out
even basic tasks, such as getting duplicate keys made for a
classroom or hiring a DJ for a school dance.
Throughout the study, the building council continued to
be dysfunctional. The other building council leaders were
principals and operated in a different leadership model, and
when present at the meetings they had the ability to make
decisions on the spot if needed. Summit staff members, how-
ever, always needed to go back to the rest of the staff before
making any decisions. One explanation for the impasse of
the building council group is that the different leadership
models did not work within the time constraints necessary
for building decisions. Another explanation is that the other
building leaders were assigned into their leadership roles as
principals in the multiplex, therefore not choosing to be a
leader of a small school.
Teacher-Cooperative Model.The teacher-cooperative model
gives teachers a systematic way to bypass the traditional
chain of command, which relies on a principal, and act as a
collaborative body of classroom-level reformers, making
daily decisions in ways that will benefit their students (Wil-
liams, 2007). This type of leadership model provides more
autonomy in decision making but does require staff members
to take on more tasks. Dave explains,
Our leadership model has been very confusing over the last 3
years. We started out as a lead-teacher model and no one really
knew a lot about what that was at that time. And then we became
more of a teacher cooperative where we tried to solve everything
through consensus and long discussions. (D. Segal, personal
communication, April 6, 2009)
At Summit High School, teachers faced a heavy workload
that included, among other things, long, arduous meetings.
Many were not willing to put the extra time in to get every-
thing done, for example, arranging parent informational
meetings, or afterschool clubs and activities. As a result,
many teachers left during the 1st and 2nd year.
For a teacher collaborative model to be successful, all
teachers need to embrace the ways in which decisions are
reached by consensus. The reality of teachers practicing
leadership is far from simplistic.
Knowledge of Small Schools.According to Meier (2005),
teachers must believe in and be involved in their small
schools for those schools to be successful. Teachers in small
schools need to rethink how schooling is done; understand-
ing what small schools are about is the first step. Summit
teachers were unprepared. Emily, a new English teacher
explains,
I think small schools struggle, because they are dealing with the
population that comes out of factory sort of education style and
all of a sudden they have to learn and it is the students who are
also going into shock. (E. Jones, personal communication, April
7, 2009)
It is difficult to provide engaging teaching and learning in
an environment that is unfamiliar. This was true for the
majority of the staff at Summit High School.
The research revealed that staff members knew little
about teaching and learning in small schools, most of them
Bronson 7
referred to the basic features of small schools, most notably
school size. Nilga, a math and science teacher, commented,
"Small school is an alternate school that has 100 students per
grade level, or it has a limited enrollment" (N. Nganle, per-
sonal communication, March 20, 2009), or "small schools
should have small classroom sizes" (T. Johnson, personal
communication, April 7, 2009).
It appeared that on some level, Summit High School was
not really functioning as a small school, which resulted in
the staff not understanding how they were a small school
other than referring to size or knowing students' names.
The literature suggests that to truly embrace small school
reform, teachers need to be educated and understand the
nuances of teaching and learning within a small school to
take advantage of all the things small schools can offer staff
and students.
Key Finding: A Continuous Struggle
Shared Space.Small schools are often required to share
space with other schools. This is primarily the case because
school districts need to utilize the buildings that they already
own and operate, and most of these are old large comprehen-
sive school buildings. Unfortunately, districts often do not
spend the money to renovate these spaces to accommodate
the new small school configurations, and this was the case in
WPS.
The staff and the students at Summit High School did not
embrace the shared space or multiplex configuration. Summit
High School's school calendar is slightly different than the
other three schools; they start 3 weeks earlier in the fall and
end 3 weeks earlier in the spring compared with the other
three schools in the multiplex. When Summit High School
first opened in 2005, they had the school to themselves for
the first 3 weeks. Dave reflects on what that experience was
like:
Thinking back to our first 3 heavenly weeks when it was just us
and our kids, I mean of course there were problems and there
was profanity and all the things that bug you but once the other
schools moved in, everything was just . . . [it] went to hell.
Everything got twice as hard in a week. (D. Segal, personal
communication, April 6, 2009)
Summit High School was located in the basement near the
cafeteria and the gymnasium. Being near the common spaces
was a problem as the students from the other schools con-
stantly interrupted Summit's school day, either by kicking on
doors, running through the hallways, or starting fights.
Eventually, all common doors in Summit High School
became locked doors, including the teacher work rooms,
classrooms, the library, and bathrooms.
Throughout the study, the tensions and problems associ-
ated with the shared space continued to deteriorate. In
response to the tensions, Summit concentrated on character
education and appropriate behavior. Ruth comments that the
other schools "have too much power over our education
here, because I feel like they are either interrupting our edu-
cation or they have kids running down our hallways" (R.
Menner, personal communication, March 26, 2009). This
situation caused Summit students to shift their identities to fit
in with the students from the other small schools in the mul-
tiplex. Summit students acted one way in the classroom and
once they were in the hallways, they switched into a different
role that was more accepted among the population of stu-
dents; they did not want to be seen by their peers as different.
It became a chameleon effect. The poor behaviors became
the status quo and continued to be perpetuated. This became
the accepted school culture.
District Policies. The small school reform movement has been
about creating an environment where students can flourish
personally and academically. Small schools are not little rep-
licas of large schools. Successful small schools are about cre-
ating change in curriculum, school culture, teacher's work,
and student assessment (Raywid & Schmerler, 2003). For
these changes to occur, the policy environments supporting
small schools need to change as well.
Summit High School had difficulty working with WPS.
Their processes appeared to be outdated and remained
unchanged even though the school structure had changed.
On one hand, WPS claimed to support the small school ini-
tiative, but on the other hand, expected Summit to operate
like a large school with the same reporting structures. These
reporting practices have not been altered to recognize the
newly changed school programs. There is a sense of "same-
ness" that continues to prevail; WPS operates as though
schools, large and small, are the same and should be treated
the same (D. Segal, personal communication, April 6, 2009).
This was extremely frustrating to the teacher leaders at
Summit.
There were other countless examples of WPS using out-
dated practices included in the field notes throughout the
study. For example, district principal meetings were held
during the school day. Teacher-led administrators were not
able to attend because they were teaching in the classroom
during the meeting time. Furthermore, requiring high enroll-
ment numbers from new small schools was not realistic in
such a short period of time. At times, the situations seemed
so simple to handle and yet the processes to which the teach-
ers were asked to adhere seemed obsolete and excessively
time-consuming. As Summit High School attempted to
develop systems that worked for their school, they were met
with resistance from the district. Tensions emerged between
which policies the district was willing to change and which
policies it was not. One major problem Summit was dealing
with was sharing teachers within the multiplex. WPS District
put a rule in place that schools cannot share teachers if the
schools are operating under different calendars. Even though
Summit is housed with three other schools, because of this
8 SAGE Open
rule it would not be able to share any teachers with the other
schools because those schools have a different school calen-
dar. The schools in Grassmore that share a similar calendar to
Summit are located miles away and are large comprehensive
schools that would not need to share teachers to save money.
One benefit of small schools sharing space is that they have
the opportunity to offer extra programs, including after-
school activities or clubs, and the cost is shared by all of the
schools. However, this new payroll rule would make that
impossible for Summit High School. At a time when budgets
are extremely tight, this adds another burden for the teachers
to take on more responsibility within their own schools.
These and other requirements added unnecessary layers to
a system that should be more supportive in helping small
schools in the first few years of existence. The issues with
WPS hampered teachers of Summit's abilities to act autono-
mously and make decisions that were right for their school,
their staff, and their specific circumstances. The district
reverting to a "sameness" mentality resulted in Summit
remaining stagnant in many areas, and being forced to
develop an activist approach to simply get things done.
Activist Approach.Small schools are about creating schools
that fulfill the promise of what education can be, and sustain-
ing a democratic environment in which families can choose
the right school for their children. To continue to envision,
fight for, and sustain these schools and environments, teach-
ers and leaders in small schools have an ongoing battle. Sim-
ple survival is a constant preoccupation for many small
schools, and even well-established small schools are notori-
ous for the breathtaking demands placed on those that work
within them (Mohr, 2000). Leaders find themselves spending
long hours crafting plans to counteract the ongoing resis-
tance from district policies that just do not make sense.
Dave took on an activist role to fight for the programs and
concessions that he felt were necessary for Summit to be suc-
cessful. The Innovative Schools Calendar was an example.
The Innovative Schools Calendar was a collaborative effort
that used a shared calendar and resources to provide more
student contact time, shorter vacation time, more time
for professional development, and collaboratively operated
project-based enrichment and credit recovery intersessions
(school document, March 17, 2009). Dave's proposal
requested US$1,714,000 in funding for the 2-year program.
Dave suggested that the government "stimulus funding pro-
vides us with the opportunity to do something bold" (school
document, March 17, 2009) and this program will garner the
results that the district would want, namely, increased aca-
demic achievement, as well as increased teacher retention
rates, increased graduation rates, and decreased suspensions
and disciplinary actions. The innovative school calendar was
eventually approved but not without a fight.
Analysis of Findings. Restructuring a large high school into a
smaller learning community is a challenging process. The
literature does not offer much about this process in terms of
the political struggles that occur within the school building
and between the schools and the district offices, nor does the
literature talk about the culture clashes that exist in and com-
plicate the physical spaces shared by new small schools. The
personal sacrifices that small schools demand from their cre-
ators are tremendous. Few realize this until they are already
knee-deep in the reform effort:
There are some pitfalls that await unsuspecting small school
designers. A small school is not merely a change of scale; it is a
change of intensity and it requires a whole new set of responses.
If that is not realized by everyone embarking on the journey,
there will be a terrible lot of energy expended with little gain.
(Mohr, 2000, p. 141)
A significant factor in creating small learning communi-
ties is strong, caring leadership that keeps everyone focused
throughout the change process. There must be someone in
charge, someone who can anticipate the dangers, read the
terrain, collect the wisdom, and inspire confidence, espe-
cially when not feeling very confident (Mohr, 2000).
This research study explored the ways in which one new
small high school, born out of a sweeping initiative to down-
size existing schools in a midwestern state, has experienced
this reform movement.
Theoretical Framework Discussion.Fine's (2005) research on
small school reform provided a framework to compare the
evolution of Summit Montessori High School with the pro-
cesses of other small schools that have proven successful
based on her research. Fine stated that new small high schools
need to focus on several elements, including access, partici-
pation and democracy, commitments to equity, sophisticated
systems of assessment that support better teaching and learn-
ing, and social justice and social responsibility. By focusing
on these elements, institutions are organizing themselves as
schools that are designed to make a difference in the lives of
their students, rather than just calling themselves "small
schools" while engaging in practices that do not support the
true intention of the reform movement.
Fine (2005) referred to "access, participation, and democ-
racy," as the process of providing education to the students
who need it most, for example, those from poor urban cities
enrolled in schools with the least amount of resources.
According to Fine, small schools were designed to counter-
act this trend, primarily in urban centers, by developing
schools where students felt like they belonged while also
being challenged academically. Wealthier communities pro-
vide their students an educational environment in which stu-
dents typically flourish, move onto college, and become
contributing members of society. The statistics presented on
Weston School District suggest that students in Weston are
suffering from the same disparity in education between
wealthier and poorer communities. The number of students
Bronson 9
who graduate from suburban schools in Weston is 82.5%,
while only 54.5% graduate from urban schools (Thomas,
2008). Affluent families can make a choice between public
school with advanced college-preparatory tracks or small
private schools, some with a traditional orientation, some
organized around a theme such as technology, and some with
a particular educational approach (Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, 2003). All students should have the same oppor-
tunity, regardless of color or socioeconomic background, to
pursue a rigorous education and attend college. These are the
beliefs that began the original grassroots efforts around cre-
ating smaller schools for students in urban cities. Small
school reform efforts, therefore, should not be driven by pri-
vate funding in an attempt to transform schools into entities
that do not equally offer education to all types of students, or
work any differently than large comprehensive schools.
Fine's (2005) concept of small school reform is truly
focused on students' needs and democracy. Fine's research
suggests that small schools must move cautiously and ensure
that the schools are defined with a clear concept that focuses
on students' needs. Students and their parents should have a
choice between many high school programs that offer unique
curriculum ideas when it comes time to choose a high school.
Students, along with their parents, can decide which high
school's program matches their own career aspirations.
Small schools that focus on the talents of the individual stu-
dent, assess the student with creative alternate methods, and
resist using the typical "high-stakes" testing promote better
teaching and learning for their students (Fine, 2005). Districts
randomly assigning students to schools that they do not want
to attend defeats the purpose of what small schools are trying
to accomplish. Students who are forced to attend one school
rather than another will not work because they do not con-
nect with the school's concept and vision.
This research study suggests that Summit High School
did not achieve many of the small school elements that have
defined Fine's (2005) work. For example, student access to
Summit is still being manipulated by the district office. The
district office continues to assign students to Summit High
School that does not have a Montessori background or an
interest in a Montessori or an IB curriculum focus. This pol-
icy undermines the ability of families to make the choice to
participate in a particular school's program. In addition, it is
difficult for staff members to work with students and families
that do not want to be part of the school community. Weston's
district office also has strict enrollment requirements that
negatively affected Summit High School. These polices
mandate that schools within the district must have a specific
number of students enrolled by a specific date in the fall of
each academic year or sanctions will follow. Sanctions have
included loss of teaching staff and loss of financial resources
and programming. This policy forces teachers, leaders, or
principals to fill open seats with any student willing to attend
regardless of his or her curriculum focus or previous educa-
tional background. These practices have affected the ability
of Summit's leaders to fill their school with students inter-
ested in teaching and learning within a Montessori/IB focus.
Authentic assessment, another positive element of small
schools, is missing at Summit High School. Summit's staff
members have not created authentic assessments that reflect
their unique curriculum, because the majority of them are not
trained in the Montessori philosophy. Alternate forms of
assessment ensure that student's progress is being monitored
in multiple ways instead of relying on high-stakes testing.
Research suggests that student work that involves an active
mode of acquiring knowledge is linked to heightened student
achievement (Newman, Marks, & Gamoran, 1995). Teachers
who seek alternate ways to assess student's understanding of
the curriculum are better equipped to alter the curriculum, if
needed, to ensure that critical learning is occurring.
Furthermore, the district office in Weston needed to rede-
sign its current policies to reflect the unique needs of new
small schools as they shape and implement their new pro-
grams. If these practices are not altered or changed by the
district office, Summit High School will continue to flounder
as it has for the past 3 years. If Weston is going to allow the
High School Redesign Initiative to occur, then they need to
be flexible in changing their accountability structures to
reflect the new school environments. Until Summit can
address these issues with student access, curriculum, enroll-
ment, and alternate forms of assessment, it will continue to
struggle in its evolution as a new small high school.
Discussion
The research at Summit High School revealed that there
were multiple pieces that were not held together. Ultimately,
this lack of cohesion hindered Summit High School's evolu-
tion from its initial concept, to a program, and finally to a
new small school. More specifically, a lack of knowledge on
the part of the teachers and school leaders on the school's
concept and vision, curriculum focus, and leadership models
often conflicted with the staff's ability to negotiate with
other building and district personnel, and with themselves
and their own community, which resulted in a fragmented
learning environment. In addition, operating within a multi-
plex complicated the ability of Summit High School's staff
to create a school culture that reflected their vision of what
the school should be. Although Summit struggled for auton-
omy from the other schools within their multiplex and from
the district, it floundered and was prone to many pressures to
conform and operate like a traditional comprehensive high
school. Moreover, teaching and learning did not evolve
because of school leaders' lack of knowledge of small
schools and limited information on Montessori curriculum
practices. All of these challenges hindered the ability of
Summit's staff to define their school's vision and identity
and ultimately to move the school forward. The findings
challenge some current assumptions about small school
reform and offer school leaders, teachers, and policy makers'
10 SAGE Open
suggestions for making small school reform more successful.
The research findings have identified that the ways in which
small schools handle their implementation processes, pro-
gram planning, and district policy requirements as key com-
ponents to future reform success.
Implementation Processes
To implement a new program, such as small school reform,
time and planning are important. Weston, like many other
urban cities across the United States, has felt the pressure to
make changes in its failing high schools; as a result, there has
been a tendency to rush the pace and push reform to multiple
locations at once. The Weston High School Initiative called
for more than 30 schools to be restructured over a 5-year
period. Starting small school reform in just a few schools,
concentrating on the internal infrastructure first, is a more
organized approach as compared with overhauling multiple
locations simultaneously.
The notion of starting small in a few locations first is sup-
ported and documented in the literature. Bryk, Easton,
Kerbow, Rollow, and Sebring (1993) conducted a study in
Chicago that made an overarching suggestion that urban
schools and urban districts try to implement too many pro-
grams too soon, and that schools initiate programs on the
basis of what is needed rather than on the basis of what they
are capable of handling. The study referred to this scenario as
the "Christmas tree" effect, that is, the schools adorned
themselves with program after program without carefully
planning and making sure that the programs were up and
running before moving on. Bryk et al. (1993) found that ele-
mentary school principals implementing reform acted with a
more entrepreneurial attitude, which led them to introduce
programs into the school at a pace that made no sense for
their level of organizational development. Schools with no
track record of successful implementation, the authors sug-
gest, should not be attempting to implement three or four
new programs simultaneously. This study involved a teacher-
led group at the high school level attempting multiple imple-
mentations at once, 16 years after this research was done,
and the results were very similar Trying to fix many things at
once did not work in 1993 and still does not work today.
After so many years, why haven't school districts learned
from their mistakes? Why do reform efforts continue to be
implemented in this manner over and over again? One expla-
nation that this research study revealed is the notion of fair-
ness. Most districts attempt to operate under a policy of
fairness between schools and this was evident in the Weston
School District. Dave commented how difficult it was to get
approval for new initiatives for Summit unless the initiatives
were universal to most of the schools in the district. His
attempts to implement an innovative school calendar at
Summit High School provide a perfect example. When Dave
initially submitted the proposal for Summit's new school cal-
endar, it was rejected. The district did not want one high
school following a different academic calendar than the rest
of the district. The fairness policy is in place to allow equal
opportunities for all schools; if one school applies for fund-
ing for a new program or initiative, then all schools should
have the same opportunity. The problem is that all schools
are not operating under the same organizational structures.
Small schools require different support mechanisms than
large comprehensive schools or even private schools. For
example, small schools might need to share resources or
afterschool activities, as well as sharing teaching staff, or in
some cases, need leeway with enrollment numbers. However,
the fairness attitude pressures districts to begin programs or
initiatives on a much larger scale then they are able to sup-
port. Allowing multiple locations to begin new programs or
initiatives simultaneously without being able to support them
sufficiently has the potential to cause these initiatives to fail.
The findings from this research project support this claim.
The superintendent in Weston felt pressured to "fix" the fail-
ing high schools and began a large-scale initiative of trans-
forming large comprehensive high schools into smaller
learning communities without first figuring out how to sup-
port the reform initiative features, or to ensure that its teach-
ers, students, and communities would be successful
throughout the process. Weston began its initiatives without
knowing what to expect.
Based on the research findings, schools should pilot a
reform in one or two schools for a 3-year period before
allowing a large-scale reform movement to occur throughout
the entire school district. School districts would then better
understand the pitfalls, problems, and nuances of the reform
before taking it to multiple locations. Moreover, the school
districts would have more time to develop the necessary sup-
port functions before schools begin the reform process,
which would be extremely helpful to everyone involved in
the reform effort.
Program Planning
Small schools are small learning communities, first and fore-
most. The benefits of teaching and learning in small schools
have been discussed and established in the literature. The
research base supports the transformation of large compre-
hensive schools to smaller learning communities that focus
on specific unique curriculums. A challenge facing the small
schools movement as it becomes more popular is keeping
restructuring efforts true to the philosophy of small schools
(Hendrie, 2004). To be successful, small schools need to take
advantage of the benefits that this environment offers.
Program planning is intertwined in all facets of small schools,
including school organization, curriculum, and instruction.
All of these components are mutually supportive practices,
dependent on one another to realize their desired effect on
student learning (Cuban, 1998; Eisner, 1997). In this study,
staff members of Summit High School were not able to
effectively plan their teaching and learning practices or
Bronson 11
develop the school's vision during the first 3 years. In fact,
planning was lacking in many areas, including curriculum,
student assessments, school concept, professional develop-
ment, and school and student identities.
The concept of a small school and its curriculum is often
intertwined. For Summit, a big part of the school concept
was centered on the unique Montessori curriculum. However,
only three teachers at Summit were certified in the full scope
of the curriculum program that defined their school. This
lack of training and knowledge made it impossible for them
to develop relevant instruction or make any decisions about
changing their own method of teaching. Professional devel-
opment opportunities for these teachers were limited because
of a lack of funds and district travel policies. The opportunity
to create personalized learning for students is one of the ben-
efits of smaller learning communities; unfortunately, the
staff at Summit was not able to capitalize on this benefit.
Another important element in program planning for small
learning communities is developing a clear vision of the
school. As administrators and teachers rush to restructure
schools, they may only take the time to understand reform
superficially; defining what the school is early on is vital to
its staying true to reform philosophies. Mohr (2000) sug-
gested that everything in a small school has an amplified
impact: "Large schools are ocean liners on a steadier
course--for better or worse, they keep on going. Small
schools are little sailboats, maneuverable but easily tipped"
(p. 144). This was certainly the case at Summit High School;
they were barely able to stay afloat.
Developing a statement that defines the vision of the
school is of critical importance as the small school is being
formed. The vision is a critical step because it provides focus
and stability for a new small school, and keeps the small
school on course. According to Feldman, Lopez, and Simon
(2006), most small school conversion efforts get bogged
down in the daily decisions that staff members face when
time and resources are truly limited. They explain,
When a group of people are attuned to their collective vision,
they are more likely to stay connected to the students' needs and
their long-range conversion goals. They are less likely to be
derailed by the day-to-day challenges conversion presents along
the way. Vision gives those involved a sense of purpose,
identifies compelling reasons, defines understandable goals for
each action. (Feldman et al., 2006, p. 18)
Summit High School floundered for many years because
the school leaders and teachers lacked a clear vision of the
school. A school's vision defines its unique design, including
its structure, culture, and instructional approach. "A solid
pedagogical foundation and vision for the school makes
design more effective" (Feldman et al., 2006, p. 84). The
staff of Summit struggled in creating a vision.
Fundamentally, program planning in small schools must
focus on developing a strong school identity that is rooted in
innovative curriculum and program offerings. This research
study indicated that from the beginning the schools sharing
space in the Summit multiplex were competing against each
other for their school identities and overall school domi-
nance. This competition moved from battling to enroll stu-
dents to meet district enrollment numbers to outright rivalries
and fights between the students. This situation escalated
partly due to the breakdown of the building council as well as
the other school leaders not fully buying into the small school
reform idea. Other school leaders were not as invested in
their own schools changing into a new small structure, as not
all of the leaders supported small school reform. In the early
days, there was a lot of antismall school chatter among some
leaders in Old Summit. According to one assistant principal,
small schools do nothing more than "transition kids in and
out" (L. Blake, personal communication, January 16, 2009),
or simply shuffle people around. "Small schools are hard to
fund and hard to run properly; there is not enough selection
of interested students or good teachers" (L. Blake, personal
communication, January 16, 2009). Lucinda, who clearly
does not support small schools stated, "Education is not a
priority for this group [urban high school students], and the
statistics show that small school reform efforts usually don't
last more than 2 years" (L. Blake, personal communication,
January 16, 2009).
This type of viewpoint does not lend itself to cooperation
between the schools. It was clear that two competing forces
were at play almost constantly. On one hand, there seemed to
be a need to retain the positive image of Old Summit, the
former large comprehensive school, and on the other hand,
the need to establish separate school identities. The actual
processes by which small schools are created are important
to the success of each individual school program and can
affect the relationships between the small programs, particu-
larly if they share larger multiplex spaces (Mohr, 2000). The
schools sharing the space of Old Summit never developed a
sense of a shared community, and deeper relationships
between all of the multiplex leaders and entire student body
at Old Summit never evolved. This clearly affected the stu-
dents at Summit High School. Summit's students did not
connect with students from other schools in the building and
often felt the need to shift their identities to fit in.
For Summit High School, the shared space became a
complicated space for the students to maneuver on a daily
basis, and as a result, suspension rates soared. In 2008, there
were 242 students enrolled in Summit High School, and 90
students were suspended for a total of 249 times (school doc-
ument, December 15, 2008). It appears that the shared space
configuration had a detrimental effect on the students. Mohr
(2000) suggested that small schools view behavior issues
more broadly in an attempt to change the behavior:
Small schools that are not prepared to see student conflicts
or acting-out behavior as a signal for a community-wide
response will suffer far greater consequences and can find
12 SAGE Open
themselves with ever-increasing disruptions. The typical
course corrections--increased attempts to control and be
controlled--will result in an escalation of tension and anger.
Small schools must use the community as a vehicle for
dealing with issues and not revert to familiar and inappropriate
consequences, such as automatic suspension. (pp. 144-145)
Conflict resolution is not just about stopping fights but
connecting the negative behavior more broadly to the cur-
riculum and the lives of the students. "When effectively
woven throughout the culture of the school, the resulting cur-
riculum will include and be about everything going on in
both the school and the world" (Mohr, 2000, p. 152).
Summit's leaders were not able to foster a sense of commu-
nity with the other schools, and as Mohr (2000) stated, "A
true community values each of its members and makes them
feel valuable" (p. 153). Students need to be supported and
valued within their schools and teachers need to help create
environments where conflict resolution is a primary compo-
nent in building "productive and high-functioning learning
environments" (Mohr, 2000, p. 153). In the end, the Summit
teachers became somewhat complacent to this growing prob-
lem. They accepted this type of behavior as a large part of
their daily activities.
Leadership Model
The research revealed that the leadership model at Summit
was not developed in a way that allowed the school to func-
tion properly, either as a separate entity or as a part of the
multiplex. Teachers share leadership tasks in small schools
that are spread across the entire school rather than being cen-
trally located with one person. Teachers must take on more
responsibility, but often have less training and guidance on
how to be successful, within this new leadership model. The
teachers at Summit were clearly not prepared for or sup-
ported in their new capacity as school leaders.
The distributive leadership model might be a better option
for new small schools and would benefit from garnering the
talents of their individual teachers by distributing the leader-
ship based on skills rather than on convenience. Spillane's
(2006) research on distributive leadership demonstrates that
this method would work well with Summit's leadership
model because it is also rooted in collaboration, and relies on
mutual trust, support, and inquiry from its members.
Evidence suggests that it is difficult for teachers to create and
sustain the conditions for improved pupil learning if those
conditions do not exist for their own learning (Silns &
Mulford, 2002). When teachers share good practice and learn
together, they increase the possibility of securing better qual-
ity teaching overall. The collaboration and collegiality fos-
tered through distributed leadership has been shown to lead
to an enhanced capacity for change and improvement at the
school and classroom levels. Research also shows that teach-
ers who work together in a meaningful and purposeful way
are more likely to remain in the profession because they feel
valued and supported in their work (Barth et al., 1999).
Distributed leadership, therefore, would provide the glue for
Summit in accomplishing more common tasks or goals, and
aid in creating a culture of expectations supported by indi-
vidual skills and abilities.
Small schools need to capitalize on the specific talents
and expertise of their teachers and other staff members.
Blending the distributive leadership methods with Summit's
teacher-cooperative model would create a stronger founda-
tion of leadership for the staff operating within a small school
as well as provide a direction for mutual collaboration.
District Policies
In addition to the organizational elements of small schools,
district policies need to change to support new smaller learn-
ing communities. Curricular and instructional reorganization
cannot be fully achieved unless the larger system of which it
is a part also changes to accommodate the new practices
(Cuban, 1998; Elmore, 2000). The organizational structures
of small schools are completely different than those of large
comprehensive schools, and yet this research concluded that
Summit was still expected to operate within old policies that
did not support its new structure. In fact, this research uncov-
ered that Summit had additional layers of accountability to
WPS regarding its Charter status. Small learning communi-
ties need the autonomy necessary to act in ways that support
their vision and their goals, and imposing old policies on new
small schools is inevitably going to undermine the success of
new small schools.
Staff members of new small schools often lack the knowl-
edge teachers at larger schools glean from years of working
in a larger system (Dentith et al., 2007). This lack of knowl-
edge can negatively affect newly formed programs. Policy
makers need to embrace bottom-up reform methods, which
allow teachers the necessary room to create and maintain
successful small schools (Darling-Hammond, 1997; Meier,
2000). Without drastic, systemic change in the larger system,
small schools will fail, and the innovation and creativity
sparked by them will be lost.
Final Thoughts
Small schools have come a long way over the past decade,
but the risks of these schools failing or reverting back to
comprehensive school practices are very real. Small schools
need to provide opportunities that are different than the larger
comprehensive schools they are replacing. Fine's (2005)
quote suggests that small schools must operate as small
schools, being mindful of the best practices identified for
those environments to flourish: "At times, I have lauded
these schools as `sites of possibility,' criticized some as
`large schools in drag'and others for `confusing hugs for cal-
culus'" (Fine, 2005, p. 11). New schools have so many chal-
lenges to meet: developing leadership models, negotiating

shared space, gaining access to resources, recruiting commit-
ted teachers, training staff, dealing with district paperwork
and outdated policies, performing state-mandated testing,
and meeting countless other challenges. Most, if not all, of
these issues were faced by the creators of Summit High
School.
This research provides a glimpse into how small high
school reform is being carried out in a large, public urban
school district, and these findings add to the growing body of
literature surrounding this fast-moving reform movement.
This research study shines light on the complexity and mess-
iness of small high schools sharing space and the repercus-
sions this arrangement has on its students and school leaders.
It also reveals the power struggles that school leaders face in
an attempt to build a community of learners. Change is dif-
ficult and not always embraced.
At their core, small schools can provide equitable educa-
tion to students seeking to learn in an environment that pro-
motes democracy, if small schools are supported in the ways
that allow them to flourish. District, state, and federal poli-
cies need to support small schools, allowing them the neces-
sary breathing room to get their programs up and running.
