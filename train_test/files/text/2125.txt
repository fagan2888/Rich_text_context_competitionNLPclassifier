ABSTRACT
Purpose. Large population studies carried out in the United States, while addressing refractive error prevalence, have
published little addressing the modes of refractive correction. As such, there are little data in the biomedical literature
concerning the characteristics of the contact lens wearing population in the United States. The purpose of this project was
to develop estimates of the demographic characteristics of a cross section of contact lens wearers in the United States
based on those who wore contact lenses on the day of their National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
examination.
Methods. The NHANES is a nationally representative sample of the U.S. population. As part of NHANES, the type of
refractive correction used is collected during a mobile medical clinic examination along with demographic variables.
Data files from the 2005­2006 and 2007­2008 NHANES were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics.
Demographic characteristics of the U.S. population using contacts during the medical clinic examination were derived.
Associations between demographic variables and contact lens use were explored in age-stratified univariate and
multivariate analyses taking into account the complex sampling frame.
Results. In univariate analysis, age (p  0.001) and the availability of health insurance (p  0.007) have negative
associations with contact lens use, while female gender (p  0.001), higher socioeconomic status (p  0.001), and higher
educational attainment (p  0.001) are associated with increased contact lens use. In multivariate analysis, age (p 
0.001), socioeconomic status (p  0.001), the interaction of age with gender (p  0.001), and the interaction of
socioeconomic status with education (p  0.002) are associated with contact lens use.
Conclusions. Four demographic variables, age, socioeconomic status, age-gender interaction, and socioeconomic
status-education interaction, defined those likely to be using contact lens on any given day in the United States. Together,
these four variables identify almost 9 of 10 contact lens users.

Estimates of the size of the contact lens population in both the
United States and worldwide vary substantially with world-
wide estimates ranging from 125 million in 2004 to 100
million in 2009 to 140 million in 2010.1­3 Sources largely from
industry placed the size of the U.S. contact lens population in 2004
at between 28 to 39 million persons, with estimates in 2009 of 38
to 39 million.1,2 Large population studies carried out in the United
States while addressing refractive error prevalence have published
little addressing the modes of refractive correction. As such, there
are little data in the biomedical literature concerning the charac-
teristics of the contact lens wearing population in the United
States. Most data on contact lens demographics are supplied by the
contact lens industry with little information on how the data were
collected or supplying precision of the estimates.
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) is one of the major data collection instruments used in
the United States to track health trends for children and adults.
The NHANES has been administered since the 1960s by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) under the direction of
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The NHANES is
a nationally representative sample of the U.S. population and each
year enrolls about 5000 people. There are two main components of
the NHANES: an interview and a medical examination. The in-
terviews are conducted by trained health care interviewers in par-
ticipant's homes and includes socioeconomic, demographic, and
health risk factor information. The medical examination is con-
ducted in mobile clinics by physicians and other trained health

nation component consists of medical, dental, and physiological mea-
surements as well as laboratory tests.4 NHANES data have been used
previously to estimate the prevalence of refractive error and undercor-
rection of refractive error in the United States.4­6 The purpose of this
project was to develop estimates on the demographic characteristics of
contact lens users based on NHANES data.
METHODS
NHANES Methods
In each NHANES cycle, a subsample of participants aged 12
years and older is selected for examination within the mobile med-
ical clinics. As part of the mobile clinic examination, distance visual
acuity (Snellen) is measured for all participants while near acuity is
measured only for participants older than 50 years. Before any
visual acuity testing, participants are asked whether they use glasses
or contacts for distance vision activities such as watching television
(Fig. 1). If the subject answers yes to using glasses or contacts for
distance tasks, a composite response of using corrective lenses is
noted. Participants are then asked whether the corrective lenses
were available at the clinic visit. If yes, it is noted whether the
correction is contacts, glasses, or whether both together are used for
acuity testing. For all participants having spectacles with them, the
spectacles are measured by automated lensometry. Similar meth-
ods are applied for near acuity. Each participant regardless of
whether corrective lenses are reportedly used has distance refractive
correction estimated by autorefraction.
Statistical Methods and Variable Definitions
The NHANES is a probability sample intended to be represen-
tative of the U.S. population with a complex sampling scheme
using stratification, clustering, and oversampling of some demo-
graphic groups. Data from the 2005­2006 and 2007­2008
NHANES were obtained from the National Center for Health
Statistics. These 2-year cycles are the most current publicly avail-
able NHANES data and were merged into a single file. Merging
cycles allows a larger absolute sample size and tighter confidence
interval (CI) calculations of the weighted sample. After merging,
4-year sample weights were then generated for the entire data set
using the method suggested by NCHS.6 This produced an actual
sample size of 13,074 with a 4-year weighted U.S. population aged
12 years and older of 232,830,156. Interview and medical exami-
nation data have different sample weights and in keeping with the
methods suggested by NCHS medical examination sample weights

were used for all calculations. An age-stratified cross-sectional
study was carried out. All statistical analyses were carried out on the
appropriate 4-year weighted sample accounting for the complex
design (SAS survey) using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC). Chi-squared and logistic regression methods were used to
evaluate associations between the demographic and measured vari-
ables. Variance estimations and 95% CI were calculated using the
Taylor linearization method. Rao-Scott 2 values are given where
reported. In multivariate association analyses, each individual de-
mographic variable and age interaction terms were entered into
regression equations. Due to the well-known associations of eth-
nicity with income and education with income, both were added as
potential interaction terms. Stepwise reductions of variables not
approaching statistical significance (p  0.1) were done until the
most parsimonious model with highest concordance was achieved.
Subjects were considered to be contact lens wearers if they used
contact lenses for the entering distance visual acuity task. This
included individuals who used a combination of spectacles and
contacts for acuity testing. A convenient categorical variable for age
was created with four levels: 12 to 18 years, 18 to 40 years,
40 to 50 years, and 50 years and older. The age categories
represent a combination of common clinical divisions and col-
lected data categories. Although the NHANES sample is extremely
large, contact lens wear becomes infrequent in older adults neces-
sitating categorical grouping, further NHANES truncates age at 85
and true linear analysis is not possible. The developed age categories
were used in univariate and multivariate analyses except as noted for
descriptive statistics. NHANES classifies race into five categories:
Mexican, other Hispanic, white, African-American, and other race
including those of mixed race. White race and other race were used as
the reference categories for comparative analyses unless otherwise
noted. The variable poverty to income ratio (PIR) was used as the
measureofsocioeconomicstatus.PIRisacontinuousmeasureusedby
the U.S. government to assess poverty status and takes into account
income, expenses, and family size. Those with PIR 1.0 have income
below the federal poverty level for families, while those with PIR 4
areconsideredhighincome.Afive-levelcategoricalvariableofPIRwas
created based on criteria used in reporting data from the Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey.8 High income was used as the reference for
analyses except as noted. Educational attainment was categorized into
five categories 9th grade, 9th to 11th grade, high school graduate or
General Educational Development equivalent, some college or asso-
ciatedegree,andcollegegraduateorabove.NHANEScollectsdataon
whether each subject is covered by health insurance as a dichotomous
response. This dichotomous response to having insurance was used in
univariate and multivariate tests. For those having health insurance,
subjects are asked a series of questions to determine whether they are
covered by Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, or military- and
state-sponsored plans. The type of insurance was only evaluated in
univariate analysis with contact lens wear for general demographic
information. An age-limited analysis of those younger than 65 years
was carried out to evaluate the impact of Medicare.
Use of contact lenses during the near acuity task was considered
separately to develop estimates of type and use of presbyopic con-
tacts in the United States. Near-contact use was divided into three
broad categories: those who used a combination of glasses and
contacts, those who used only contacts (presumed multifocals),
and those who used contacts that were likely prescribed as mono-
vision. Estimates of presumed multifocal contact lens wear were
derived by calculating those who used only contact lenses for the
distance and near acuity testing and did not use glasses with the
contacts for either task or have monovision correction coded. A
specific coding comment is found in NHANES data denoting
whether subjects were wearing monovision in either spectacles or
contact lenses. As a part of NHANES protocol, this comment
should be queried for each subject. The coding of both the distance
and near acuity included an option for subjects using both glasses
and contacts together during testing. If the subject used glasses
with contacts for either task, they were classified as using both.
RESULTS
For the U.S. population older than 12 years in the aggregate
years 2005­2008, an estimated 47.6% (95% CI 45.8­49.4) of the
population reported using either glasses or contact lenses for dis-
tance vision. Of those reported using distance vision correction, a
population estimate of 89.8% had verifiable corrective lenses with
them at the time of the NHANES mobile health clinic examina-
tion. Characteristics of those with corrective lenses are found in
Table 1. Those who did not have corrective lenses with them were
more likely to be younger, be of non-white race, have lower edu-
cational attainment, and have lower socioeconomic status.
The current data provide a cross-sectional assessment of lens
wear in the United States. Based on estimates from those having a
verifiable lens correction, at least 8.4% (95% CI 7.4­9.4) of the
total U.S. population older than 12 years used contact lenses on
any given day during the years 2005­2008 (Table 2). Within the
U.S. population using corrective lenses, 18.7% (95% CI 16.5­
19.3) used contacts lenses for distance vision. There were at least
18.6 million contact lenses wearers (95% CI 17.4­20.8) on an
average day during this period (Table 2).
Age
Corrective lens use for distance vision in the U.S. population
differs by a number of demographic factors but varies most dra-
matically with age increasing from approximately one-third among
those aged 12 to 18 years (33.9%, 95% CI 31.4­36.5) to almost
two-thirds for those aged 50 years and older (63.6%, 95% CI
61.4­65.8). As the percentage of the U.S. population using dis-
tance corrective lenses increased, contact lens use decreased. Con-
tact lens wear peaked in the U.S. population in the age group 18
to 40 years at 12.6% (95% CI 10.9­14.0) and prevalence de-
creased to 4% of the U.S. population (3.6%, 95% CI 2.6­4.6)
for those aged 50 years and older. Of those using corrective lenses,
the age groups 12 to 18 years and 18 to 40 years had similar
rates of contact lens usage at 39.0% (95% CI 31.9­46.0) and
37.1% (95% CI 33.3­41.0), respectively. The highest use of con-
tact lenses was found in the 10-year period between ages 15 to 25
years with almost half of refractive correction in the group aged 15
to 20 years by contacts (46.3%, 95% CI 39.3­53.3). Decline in the
use of contact lenses began in the late twenties with the median age
of contact lens wearers in the United States being 31.4 years (95%
CI 29.7­33.1). There were no NHANES participants older than
80 years using contact lenses. Univariately, increasing age is in-
versely associated with contact lens wear. Each five-year increase in

age over age 20 years resulted in a 30% [odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95%
CI 0.67­0.73] reduced odds of using contact lenses.
More than 86% of the U.S. population older than 50 years
reported using corrective lenses for near vision (86.5%, 95% CI
85.2­87.8). Based on data obtained at both the distance and near
testing, slightly 3 million people older than 50 years in the
United States used contact lenses daily in this period. The break-
down of lens wear at near was 31.8% spectacles and contact lens
combination (95% CI 21.2­42.4), 17.3% monovision (95% CI
9.0­25.5), and 51% (95% CI 44.1­57.7) multifocal lenses.
Gender
Gender was associated with contact wear with women 40%
more likely to use contacts than men (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.18­
1.66). Women made up about two-thirds of all contact lens
wearers during the 2005­2008 time period (64.7%, 95% CI
61.4­68.0) (Table 3). On closer examination however, gender
differences in contact lens use are age-dependent. The median age
of women contact lens wearers was about 3 years older than men at
32.7 years (29.7­35.7 years) and 29.6 years (26.4­32.9 years). For
both the age groups 12 to 18 years (2  1.14, p  0.28) and 18
to 40 years (2  0.02, p  0.87), gender differences were not
statistically significant in age-stratified univariate analysis. Over
the age of 40 years, gender differences in contact lens use became
marked. The gender ratio of women to men contact lens wearers
increased from 1.5:1 in the age group 18 years to 3:1 for those 50
years and older. Women comprised 68.3% (95% CI 58.8­
77.9) of all contact users aged 40 to 50 years and 74.3%
(95% CI 63.9­84.6) in those aged 50 years and older. In each
of the older age cohorts, gender differences in contact lens use
were statistically significant (2  6.71, p  0.01, and 2 
9.03, p  0.005, respectively).
Ethnicity
Whites are the largest ethnic demographic group in the United
States and comprised 70.1% (95% CI 65.5­74.6) of the U.S.
population aged 12 years and older during 2005­2008. Whites
made up a slightly larger percentage of all contact lens wearers
(77.5%, 95% CI 71.9­83.2) compared with their population
prevalence (Table 3). Non-whites, however, made up almost one-
third of contact lens users (29.4%, 95% CI 21.9­36.6) in the
demographic 18 to 40 age group. As a group (OR 1.04, 95%
CI 0.81­1.35), non-whites were not less likely to use contact lenses
than whites. While whites make up the bulk of total contact lens
users, they did not have the highest prevalence of contact lens use
by ethnicity. The NHANES ethnic group "other" had the highest
usage of contact lenses (23.7%, 95% CI 16.1­31.1) with Mexican
Americans having the second highest prevalence. The ethnic group
"other" is a heterogeneous group, but it presumably has a large
constituency of those with Asian descent. African-Americans and

U.S. Contact Lens User Demographics--Swanson 843
Optometry and Vision Science, Vol. 89, No. 6, June 2012
non-Mexican Hispanics had the lowest use of contact lenses
among the NHANES ethnic groups but were no less likely to use
contact lenses than whites. African-Americans (OR 0.62, 95% CI
0.39­0.96) and non-Mexican Hispanics (OR 0.62, 95% CI
0.38­0.99) did have reduced odds of using contact lenses when
the reference group is "other race." Contact lens use among ethnic
minorities decreased relative to population in the age group 40 to
50 years, and this trend continued with age so much so that
contact lenses users aged 50 years and older were almost exclusively
white (92.3%, 95% CI 87.4­96.9). This is partially accounted for
by population demographics. Whites are proportionally a larger
percentage of the U.S. population older than 50 years (78.5%,
95% CI 73.9­83.1) and represent an even higher percentage of
the U.S. population using corrective lenses for distance (82.5%,
95% CI 77.8­87.2) in this age group.
Socioeconomic Status
Socioeconomic status was associated with contact lens use (2 
60.4, p  0.001). More than 60% of the U.S. population was found
in the middle and high income PIR groups (Table 4). Among those
reported using corrective lenses for distance, 72% had middle or high
income with 80% of all contact lens users in these two socioeco-
nomic groups. All socioeconomic groups had reduced odds of using
contact lenses compared with those with high income. The trend was
however not strictly linear. A small increase in the prevalence of con-
tact lens use was found among those whose socioeconomic status is at
the poverty level. In fact, compared with those in the middle income
demographic, those meeting the poverty definition were no less likely
to use contact lenses (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54­1.11). Older contact
lensusershadhighersocioeconomicstatusthanyoungerusers.Inboth
the age groups, 40 to 50 years (92.8%, 95% CI 86.5­99.2) and
50 years and older (93.6%, 95% CI 88.7­98.5), 90% of contact
lens users were in the middle or high socioeconomic groups. In both
these age groups, almost two-thirds of contact lens users were in the
high-income demographic.
Education
In the U.S. population during the study period, about 55%
(55.4%, 95% CI 52.3­58.5) of adults older than 18 years had
some college or were college graduates and beyond (Table 5). As
education level increased, so did the percentage of the population
who used refractive correction. Among the population older than
18 years, those with at least some college education accounted for
60% of all refractive correction users (61.2%, 95% CI 57.9­
64.6) and almost 80% of contact lens users (78.6%, 95% CI 73.2­
84.0). Higher educational attainment was associated with contact
lens use (2  73.1, p  0.001). Contact lens use among those
using refractive correction increased from 2.5% (95% CI 0.0­5.6)
among those with less than a 9th grade education to 20% among
those with college degrees (23.4%, 95% CI 19.5­27.2). Com-
pared with those with college degrees, persons with all other levels
of educational attainment had lower odds of contact lens use. The

844 U.S. Contact Lens User Demographics--Swanson
Optometry and Vision Science, Vol. 89, No. 6, June 2012
differences in the prevalence of contact lens use among those with
some college and college degrees approached statistical significance
(OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66­1.02), while those with all lower levels of
educational attainment had a statistically significant 60 to 90%
reduced odds of contact lens use. Similar to other demographic
characteristics, changes in contact use and educational attainment
were seen with aging. Approximately 80% of all contact lens users
in the age groups 18 to 40 years (79.3%, 95% CI 73.2­85.5)
and 40 to 50 years (85.3%, 95% CI 76.4­94.1) had at least
some college. The percentage of persons aged 50 years and older
with some college education decreased (69.2%, 95% CI 55.7­
82.8) with a larger share of contact lens wearers among those with
high school and 9th to 11th grade education.
Health Insurance
Approximately 17% of the U.S. population did not have health
insurance during the years 2005­2008. Health insurance coverage
during this period followed a U-shaped distribution decreasing
from 87% among adolescents aged 12 to 18 years to 70% among
those 18 to 40 years before increasing to near-universal cover-
age for seniors 65 years and older (98.4%, 95% CI 98.0­98.8).
Those with health insurance had higher overall use of refractive
error correction (51% vs. 39%) but lower use of contact lenses
among those using refractive correction than Americans without
health insurance (18% vs. 24%, 2  8.3, p  0.007). While
this was true, overall, about 85% of contact lenses wearers did
have some form of health insurance (84.9%, 95% CI 81.9­
87.8). The difference in contact lens use among those with and
without health insurance was largely accounted for by the near-
universal coverage of seniors who were also much less likely to
use contact lenses. For the population younger than 65 years,
contact lens use is nearly equivalent (p  0.68) between those
with (24.6%, 95% CI 19.8­29.4) and without health insurance
(23.6%, 95% CI 20.9­26.4). As might be expected, those with
private insurance had a higher rate of contact lens use than did
those with the major federal low-income health insurance plan
Medicaid (Table 6).
Multivariate Associations
After model reduction, four demographic variables, two main
effects, age and PIR, and two interactions terms, age by gender and
educational attainment by PIR, show association with contact lens
use (Table 7). These association models hold true for the popula-
tion aged 18 years and older and for those aged 31 years and older
in whom contact lens use begins to decline in the U.S. population.
As in univariate models, increasing age was independently and
inversely associated with contact lens use. As would be predicted
from age-stratified univariate analysis, gender only becomes im-
portant in association with contact lens use with aging as older
women are far more likely to use contacts than older men. While
higher socioeconomic status is globally associated with contact
lens use, particularly interesting is the interaction between ed-
ucation and socioeconomic status. Among adults with income
at the poverty level, as education level increased contact lens use
concomitantly increased (Table 8). In contrast to adults with
high income, contact lens use increased with lower levels of
educational attainment.

U.S. Contact Lens User Demographics--Swanson 845
Optometry and Vision Science, Vol. 89, No. 6, June 2012
DISCUSSION
Data from the NHANES provides a cross-sectional view of the
U.S. contact lens population. The estimated size of the U.S. pop-
ulation using contact lenses from the NHANES data is far smaller
than that reported from other sources.1­3 These smaller estimates
are likely related to a number of design and implementation factors
in both the NHANES and industry data. Most data from the
contact lens industry appear to be from practitioner surveys, ran-
dom telephone surveys, and sales data extrapolated to the U.S.
population. Practitioner surveys and sales data are inherently bi-
ased. In recent years, the validity of the traditional random digit
dialed telephone survey has been questioned as more Americans
screen calls with caller identification and the transition away from
landline to cell phone-only households.9
NHANES has a complex sampling frame explicitly intended to
be representative of the U.S. population; however, as with any
administrative data set, there are limitations and advantages. The
NHANES data used represents an amalgamation of the U.S. pop-
ulation from 2005 to 2008 and as such is based on a smaller overall
size U.S. population than comparable 2008 estimates from indus-
try sources. Mobile medical clinic participation, where contact lens
data is generated, was limited to those aged 12 years and older as
part of the NHANES design. While the population younger than
12 years using contacts is likely relatively small, it will lead to some
underestimation error. The NHANES question sequence does not
ask each interviewee or medical clinic participant directly whether
they wear contacts lenses. The lead question to participants (Fig. 1)
only records whether refractive correction is used and not the spe-
cific type. Correction type is recorded only if participants have
their corrective lenses at the time of the medical evaluation. Due to
this question sequence, about 10% of the weighted U.S. popula-
tion who reported using refractive correction was not classified as
to the type of correction. It would be anticipated that at least some
of this segment of the population would be contact lens users.
Those who did not have correction with them were younger, more
likely an ethnic minority than white, and had lower education level
and lower socioeconomic status. Younger Americans are more
likely to use contacts which would contribute to a larger total
contact lens wearing population, but this is balanced by the lower
prevalence of use among those with lower socioeconomic status
and lower education levels.
The total contact lens wearing population in the United States
comprised those who wear lens every day and those who wear
lenses on a less than a daily basis. On any given day, a part-time
wearer may choose to use spectacles or no correction at all rather
than contacts. Less than every day wear is common and known to
vary with lens type.10 The NHANES medical examination itself is
relatively innocuous and subjects are not dilated. As such, partici-
pants would not necessarily be biased against contact lens wear
anticipating dilating drops. Given the question sequence,
NHANES likely captures all every day wearers and a random prob-
ability sample of those part-time wearers likely to use contact lenses
on any single given day. This would lead to some degree of under-
estimation of the number of part-time wearers.
Using the NHANES data does have merits. Both the actual and
weighted sample sizes are extremely large eliminating many poten-
tial sources of selection bias. With the highly defined sampling
frame, CIs can be calculated around the estimates, something that
is not reported in data from industry sources. The NHANES relies
on actual lens wear rather than self-report and as such is not subject
to reporting bias. Self-report data that does not specify time peri-
ods (e.g., "have you worn contacts in the last week, six months,
etc.") could be subject to significant individual variation in those
identifying themselves as a contact lens user given the high rate of
contact lens discontinuation. The NHANES is now administered
on continuous 2-year cycles opening the possibility of long-term
monitoring. Overall, it is likely that while the NHANES data
underestimates the size of the U.S. contact lens population, it likely
does give an accurate picture of its composition.
As expected, age had an inverse association with contact lens use.
The pattern of age-related decline in contact lens use does follow
that seen from other data sources,1­3 with the decline in contact
lens use appearing well before presbyopia. Estimates from
NHANES for both the percentage of the U.S. population using
refractive correction and those using contact lenses were smaller
across each age demographic group than is generally reported from
industry data. One of the additional limitations of NHANES is the
lack of data on near vision correction use in the early presbyopic
age group 40 to 50 years. This appears to be a period when the
prevalence of contact use declines significantly at least for distance
vision wear. Unfortunately, how this relates to near vision cannot
be evaluated due to the lack of near acuity testing for this group. It
is unfortunate that these data are unavailable as it would allow not
only calculation of contact lens use but also exploration of factors
related to the onset of presbyopia. Among those aged 50 years and
older, the breakdown of the use of spectacle and contacts combi-
nation, multifocal and monovision lens appears to generally follow
the pattern reported by Morgan et al.11 from a recent international
prescribing survey. Some caution should be used with interpreta-
tion of the modality of contact use at near. The data are highly
dependent on the accurate coding of the number of monovision
users at the time of the NHANES examination. Also, CIs around
the modality type are large. Aside from the direct association with
contact lens use, the impact of age was seen across all the other
demographic variables.
Most reports indicate that women are far more likely to use
contacts than men.1,2 Although this is true, it gives an incomplete
picture as gender differences in contact lens use are largely depen-
dent on age. Assuming that most contact lens users began lens wear
in adolescence and early adulthood, NHANES data suggest that
men leave contact lens wear much younger and at a faster rate than
do women. Dropout among contact lens users is an important
issue for practitioners. Most studies of lens dropouts have concen-
trated on lens-patient interaction factors such as dryness and com-
fort. While these factors are undoubtedly important, demographic
data suggest that gender-specific differences leading to lens discon-
tinuance may exist. Further research is needed to clarify what these
differences may be.
Although almost all adults older than 50 years who use contact
lenses are white, after accounting for other factors ethnicity appears
to play little role in contact lens use. Non-whites appear at least as
likely as whites to use contact lenses. This bodes well for the future
given the changing demographics of the U.S. population. Some
caution should be exercised in interpreting the ethnicity data. De-
spite the large sample size and oversampling of some ethnic groups,
846 U.S. Contact Lens User Demographics--Swanson
Optometry and Vision Science, Vol. 89, No. 6, June 2012
precision of the estimates in some subgroups (age by ethnicity,
"other") is poor. The U.S. population is more diverse than the five
NHANES ethnic groups. Most data presented on ethnicity related
to contact lens wear list the Hispanic population as a single group.
Based on the current data, Mexican Americans were more likely to
use contacts than non-Mexican Hispanics. While these differences
appear to be related to factors beyond ethnicity, it suggests that the
Hispanic population is not homogenous related to refractive cor-
rection use. The Hispanic population in the United States is in fact
composed of 28 subgroups for census purposes based on the coun-
try of origin.12 Given the rapid growth of this population, future
studies may need to be planned to account for differences within
those of Hispanic ethnicity. Obviously, it would be incorrect to
assume the group "other ethnicity" represents a single entity. The
NHANES coding guide describes the "other race" category to
include Asians, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, and those who
have multiracial heritage. Based on census data, Asian Americans
would be the largest constituent of this group. The high use of
contact lenses in this group is likely driven by the high prevalence
of myopia in those of Asian descent.13 It should also be considered
that almost 15% of all marriages in the United States are currently
between persons of different ethnicity, and the multiethnic popu-
lation is growing rapidly.14 Little is known about refractive error in
those of multiethnic descent.
Having health insurance has been associated with higher rates of
use of eye examination and better vision outcomes.15 Knowing
this, the inverse association of contact use and health insurance
might seem puzzling. The association of health insurance and con-
tact lens wear is distorted in the U.S. population by the near-
universal coverage of older adults by Medicare. After taking into
account the large impact of Medicare, by evaluating adults younger
than 65 years, no association with having health insurance and
contact lens use was found. The absence of an association is likely
due to the relatively high percentage of younger adults in the age
group 18 to 40 years who do not have health insurance com-
pared with teens and older adults. Also, vision insurance or vision
discount plans likely have a more direct association with contact
lens wear. Census data estimate that about 21% of working age
adults have vision insurance.16 Data on ancillary insurance such as
dental and vision are not collected as part of NHANES.
Perhaps the most interesting associations with contact lens use
in the U.S. population were those with socioeconomic status and
the interaction of education and socioeconomic status. Higher
socioeconomic status being associated with contact lens use makes
intuitive sense given that a large percentage of contact lens-related
expenses are out of pocket. While education level was associated
with contact lens use in univariate analysis, it is not surprising it
was not significant in multivariate analyses. Socioeconomic status
and education level are known to co-vary with each other.17 Par-
ticularly curious is the increase in contact lens use by those whose
income is at the poverty level. A number of possible explanations
might account for why those in poverty have increased contact lens
use including higher use of medically necessary contacts, coverage
of contact lenses by state or federal indigent insurance plans, or a
higher cost-benefit valuation in this group for contact lenses. Ed-
ucation level clearly plays a role in contact lens use among this
group. Low-income persons with higher education might logically
represent college students or young professionals beginning ca-
reers; however, the mean age of this group is well past the typical
college years. Equally curious is the increased use of contacts seen
among those with high socioeconomic status but low educational
attainment compared with those in the same socioeconomic class
but with higher education level. Older contact lens users do gen-
erally show higher income with lower education level which could
explain this relationship. However, when age is looked at across the
spectrum of education level among those with high socioeconomic
status, no dramatic age affects are seen. The reasons why those with
high PIR and low lower education have higher contact lens use are
unclear.
Within the limitations of the data, the NHANES provides an
unbiased source of demographic information on cross-sectional
contact lens use within the United States. From the data, a number
of broad conclusions can be drawn. Contact lens use in the United
States is associated with four demographic variables: age, socioeco-
nomic status, age-gender interaction, and socioeconomic status-
education interaction. Together these four variables identify
almost 9 of 10 contact lens users. The U.S. population shows no
ethnic bias in contact lens use. Socioeconomic status and educa-
tional level should be looked at in conjunction with each other
relative to contact lens use. Gender differences in contact lens use
may be due to differential dropout of lens wear by men.
