Serum folate and chronic disease risk:
findings from a cohort of United States adults
Earl S Ford,a Tim E Byersb and Wayne H Gilesc
Background
Methods
Previous studies have suggested that folate may provide protection against vari-
ous chronic conditions.
We examined the effect of serum folate concentration on mortality and chronic
disease incidence in a nationally representative sample of 3059 adults of the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up
Study who were first examined from 1971 through 1975 and who were followed
for about 19 years through 1992. Proportional hazards regression was used to
estimate hazard ratios for the lowest quintile of serum folate compared with the
highest quintile for selected causes of death and disease incidence.
Results The hazards ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.18 (95% CI : 0.91-1.52); for
mortality for diseases of the circulatory system, 1.31 (95% CI : 0.82-2.12); and
for cancer mortality, 0.99 (95% CI : 0.46-2.11). The hazard ratio for incidence of
diseases of the circulatory system was 1.04 (95% CI : 0.86-1.26); and for cancer
incidence, 1.00 (95% CI : 0.61-1.66). The hazards ratio for all-cause mortality
was 1.26 (95% CI : 1.01-1.57) for participants with a serum folate of <9.3
nmol/1 compared with other participants.
Conclusions Low levels of serum folate may be associated with mortality from all-causes and
cardiovascular disease. However, the study lacked power to adequately examine
the association between folate and disease-specific endpoints. Additional studies,
using serum and other measures of folate nutritional status, are needed to
examine the relationship between folate nutrition and other more specifically
defined health outcomes.

Various studies, mostly of case-control design, have suggested
that a higher intake of folate is associated with a reduced risk
of all-cause mortality,1 cervical dysplasia and cancer,2"4 breast
cancer,5 stomach cancer.6-7 colon and rectum cancer,8"11
colorectal adenoma12"14 and hyperplastic colon polyps,15 and
myocardial infarction.16 Furthermore, studies of folate supple-
mentation have shown improvements in the cytological appear-
ance of cervical dysplasia,17 bronchial squamous metaplasia in
smokers, and reduced colon adenoma recurrence.19 Some
studies with suggestive but statistically insignificant results also
support a beneficial role for folate on adenocarcinoma of the
oesophagus,20 colon cancer,21"23 and colorectal adenomas.24

A better understanding of folate's role in humans has
provided hypotheses about how folate could play a role in the
prevention of some chronic diseases. Folate plays an important
role in the transfer of methyl and formyl groups to organic com-
pounds. Observations have suggested that deficient methylation
592
FOLATE AND CHRONIC DISEASE 593
of DNA may play a role in carcinogenesis. It is speculated that
folate's importance in the transfer of methyl groups may
account for its purported beneficial effects against cancer.13
Folate's potential role in preventing coronary heart disease is
largely indirect by helping to determine homocysteine concentra-
tions. After adjustment for plasma homocysteine concentrations,
the magnitude of the measures of association in two of these
studies was greatly reduced.46'
To examine whether serum folate concentrations affects
future occurrences of mortality and chronic disease incidence,
we analysed data from a nationally representative cohort of US
adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey I (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Follow-up Study. Spe-
cifically, we examined whether serum folate concentrations
were predictive of all-cause mortality, major circulatory disease
mortality or incidence, and cancer mortality or incidence.
Methods
Between 1971 and 1975, 18 836 people aged 12-74 participated
in NHANES I. Of these participants, the 14 407 who were 3=25
years at the baseline examination were subsequently followed
up. The methods of the original NHANES I survey and the
NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study have been presented
in detail elsewhere.58"62 Cohort members were followed
through 1992. Serum folate determinations were limited to the
3059 participants in one of the nationally representative sub-
samples of NHANES I. Serum folate was measured with a micro-
biological method with a coefficient of variation of 10-20%.63
Four waves of follow-up data collection were undertaken in
1982-1984, 1986, 1987, and 1992. The vital status of study
participants was determined during each of these periods. Death
certificates were obtained for deceased participants. Deaths
were classified as being due to diseases of the circulatory system
if the underlying code listed one of the International Classi-
fication of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-
9-CM), rubrics 390-^158 and from cancer if the underlying code
listed one of the ICD-9-CM, rubrics 140-208 except 173 (other
malignant neoplasm of skin). During the follow-up interviews,
study participants or proxies for diseased participants or those
incapable of participating in the interview were asked about
hospitalizations. Subsequently, hospitals were contacted and
hospital discharge sheets were abstracted.
Incidence of diseases of the circulatory system was defined as
either a death based on the underlying code or a hospitalization
with the ICD-9-CM codes of 390-458 listed among any of the
10 possible diagnoses. Incidence of cancer was defined as either
a death based on the underlying code or a hospitalization with
the ICD-9-CM codes of 140-208 but not 173 listed among any
of the 10 possible diagnoses. We excluded from the analyses for
diseases of the circulatory system participants who reported at
baseline that they had had a previous heart attack or stroke. We
excluded from the analyses for cancer participants who reported
at baseline that they had had cancer.
For all-cause mortality and for circulatory disease, the poten-
tial confounders we included in the analysis were age, sex, race,
education, cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure, use of
anti-hypertensive medication, serum cholesterol, body mass
index, recreational and non-recreational physical activity, self-
reported diabetes, and alcohol consumption. For cancer, the
potential confounders we included in the analysis were age,
sex, race, education, cigarette smoking, physical activity and
alcohol consumption. For cigarette smoking, we used a variable
that was constructed in part from responses obtained during the
baseline interview and in part from the first follow-up interview
from 1982 through 1984. The validity of this approach has been
demonstrated.64-65 Using the two questions 'Have you smoked
at least 100 cigarettes during your entire life?' and 'Do you smoke
cigarettes now?', three categories of smoking were constructed:
current smokers, former smokers, and never having smoked.
Because no dietary data were collected for our analytic sample,
we were unable to adjust for potential dietary confounders.
We adjusted mortality rates (all-cause and cause-specific) for
age and sex by the direct method to the 1980 US residential
population using three age groups. We performed proportional
hazards regression analyses with the software SUDAAN which
accounts for the complex sampling design of the study.66 Pro-
portionality assumptions were checked with the SAS procedure
Proc PHREG by creating time-dependent covariates for the inde-
pendent variables. We also conducted lagged analyses whereby
we excluded individuals who died within periods of up to
5 years from entry into the study.
Results
The number of participants available for each analysis and the
number of health events are shown in Table 1. Mean serum
folate concentrations for variables included in this analysis are
shown in Table 2. Women had higher folate concentrations
than men, current smokers had lower folate concentrations
than former or never smokers, participants with a cholesterol
concentration <200 mg/dl had lower folate concentrations than

overweight participants had lower folate concentrations than
participants with normal body mass index, and people taking
vitamin supplements had higher folate concentrations than
those who did not. Because the associations between serum
folate concentrations and disease endpoints were similar for
men and women, we present only data for the combined group
of study participants. We examined crude and age-adjusted
correlation coefficients between serum folate and continuous
variables. The largest correlation (r = 0.15) was found between
age and serum folate.
Age- and sex-adjusted mean folate concentrations for those
who subsequently were diagnosed with or died from various
causes and those who did not are shown in Table 3. No sig-
nificant mortality differences were observed. Participants who
later experienced incident circulatory disease had lower mean
concentrations of serum folate than did those who remained
free of circulatory disease. Age- and sex-adjusted mean serum
folate concentrations were 8.3 nmol/1 for 21 participants who
died of gastrointestinal cancer (ICD-9-CM 150-154), 9.2 nmol/1
for 13 participants who died of colon cancer (ICD-9-CM 153),
and 9.5 nmol/1 for 43 patients with a respiratory cancer (ICD-9-
CM 162). Age-adjusted means of serum folate concentrations
were 7.9 nmol/1 for 11 women who died of breast cancer (ICD-
9-CM 174) compared with 8.5 nmol/1 for women who did not
die of cancer and 9.5 nmol/1 for 15 men who died of prostate
cancer (ICD-9-CM 199) compared with 8.5 nmol/1 for men who
did not die of cancer. None of the differences were statistically
significant (P > 0.10). For participants who either died of or
were hospitalized for a cancer, the age- and sex-adjusted mean
serum folate concentrations were 7.3 nmol/1 for 48 participants
who had gastrointestinal cancer, 7.5 nmol/1 for 36 participants
who had colon cancer, and 6.7 nmol/1 for 43 patients with a
respiratory cancer. Age-adjusted means of serum folate con-
centrations were 7.3 nmol/1 for 47 women with breast cancer
compared with 8.5 nmol/1 for women who did not have cancer
and 7.7 nmol/1 for 42 men who died of prostate cancer (ICD-9-
CM 199) compared with 7.3 nmol/1 for men who did have
cancer. None of the differences were statistically significant
(P>0.10).
Mortality and incidence rates are presented in Table 4. The
proportional hazards analyses which included only participants
with complete data failed to support any significant relationship
between serum folate concentrations and any of the endpoints
(Table 4). We also repeated the cancer mortality analyses by ex-
cluding malignant neoplasms of lymphatic and haematopoietic
tissue (ICD-9-CM 200-208) and found results similar to those
for all cancers.
Although we failed to find a significant relationship between
serum folate and all-cause mortality and circulatory disease,
plots of the log relative hazard and serum folate concentration
suggested a J-shaped relationship between the risk of disease
and serum folate concentration with the lowest risk occurring
around serum folate concentrations of 18-23 nmol/1. In a post
hoc analysis, the hazard ratios were 1.26 (95% CI : 1.01-1.57)
for deaths from any cause and 1.41 (95% CI : 0.97-2.06) for
deaths from circulatory disease for participants in the lowest
quintile of serum folate concentration compared with those
in other four quintiles. Eliminating deaths occurring within
periods ranging from 1 to 5 years after entry into the study

did not change the magnitude of the hazard ratios appredably.
In no instance did we observe a graded dose-response relation-
ship. We found no interaction between age, sex, race, education,
or smoking status and serum folate concentration for mortality
from and incidence of the various health events. However, the
interaction term between serum folate, modelled as a continu-
ous variable, and diabetes status was a significant predictor of
all-cause and circulatory disease mortality. For people without
diabetes, the hazard ratios were 1.00 (95% CI : 1.00-1.01)
and 1.00 (95% CI : 0.99-1.01) for all-cause and circulatory
disease mortality, respectively, and for those with diabetes, they
were 1.01 (95% CI : 1.00-1.03) and 1.04 (95% CI : 1.01-1.07),
respectively.
Discussion
In this nationally representative sample that was followed for
about 14 years, low serum folate (<9.3 nmol/1) was associated
with small increases in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular
disease mortality but not cancer mortality. However, the size of
the hazard ratios was small and only for the post-hoc analysis for
all-cause mortality did the 95% CI exclude unity. Because
the sample size for site-specific cancers was small, we were un-
able to examine whether serum folate may have had a pro-
tective effect on the incidence of those cancers for which
previous research supports a possible relationship.
Several limitations may affect the findings of our study. It is
possible that our findings may be due to some other unmeas-
ured confounding factor among those with low serum folate
concentrations. In addition, folate may be protective for par-
ticular conditions that form only a small part of total mortality
or the broad groupings of disease we used in this analysis. Thus
the effect of folate may have been diluted by broad disease
groupings. Measuring serum folate concentrations may not be
the best indicator of folate status in individuals. Body stores of
folate can be measured in several ways: serum or plasma folate
concentrations represent shorter term, whereas red blood cell
folate represents intermediate stores. Liver biopsies are perhaps
the best measurement of body stores of folate. Potischman
concluded that the concentration of red blood cell folate was a
better predictor of cervical dysplasia than were either serum
folate concentration or dietary intake.67
We estimate that we had power of ^80% to detect hazard
ratios on the order of 1.7 comparing the lowest with the highest
quintile of serum folate for all-cause mortality, coronary
heart disease mortality and incidence, and all cancer incidence.
However, it was impossible for us to conduct analyses with suf-
ficient power for particular categories of cancer. Because some
misclassiDcation of exposure is likely, due both to true within
person variability and to laboratory assessment variability,
actual power may have been lower. Given our findings, we also
performed post hoc confidence limit analyses that showed like-
lihood estimates of less than 5% for finding true hazard ratios
of 3=2.0.
Recently, a study of elderly Italians suggested that dietary in-
take of folate determined from a 24-hour recall was an inde-
pendent predictor of mortality over a 6-year period.1 Several
studies have suggested that plasma folate concentrations are
associated with coronary artery disease and carotid artery
stenosis after adjustment for traditional risk factors. 16'46~48
However, additional adjustment for homocysteine concentra-
tions usually results in substantial attenuation of these associ-
ations. These observations are perhaps not surprising, since
folate determines homocysteine concentrations in part. In our
study, we noted a non-significant 41% increase in mortality
from circulatory diseases for participants in the lowest quintile
of serum folate concentration.
In conclusion, we found low serum folate to be weakly
associated with an increased risk for mortality from all causes
and diseases of the circulatory system but not cancer. Additional
research to better define the specificity of the protective health
effect of folate is dearly needed. Nevertheless, foods rich in
folate such as dark green vegetables, orange juice, and whole
grains, have been found to be assodated with reduced risk of
cancer and coronary heart disease and should, therefore, be part
of everyone's diet.
