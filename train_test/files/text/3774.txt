Over the past several years, the viability of single-item ques-
tionnaires as an alternative to multiple-item questionnaires
has become more apparent through the successful measure-
ment of such constructs as job satisfaction (Nagy, 2002),
attitudes toward advertisements (Bergkvist & Rossiter, 2007),
the Big Five personality traits (Woods & Hampson, 2005),
and the self-assessment of pain, fatigue, distress, and anorexia
(Butt et al., 2008). These studies, among others (e.g., Barrett &
Paltiel, 1996), have shown that single-item measures are an
effective alternative to traditional multiple-item measures
that also carry with them the benefits of ease and brevity of
administration.
Grice, Mignogna, and Badzinsky (2011) recently intro-
duced the Dynamic Analog Scale (DAS) as a flexible and
generic technique that is computer administered and can be
used to measure individual differences on psychological
constructs with a single item. Initial results have shown that
the DAS is capable of yielding data with psychometric prop-
erties similar to those of multiple-item questionnaires. Figure
1 shows a screenshot of an example DAS for the bipolar con-
struct "agreeable vs. disagreeable" generated by the Idiogrid
computer program (Grice, 2002). Instructions on how to rate
the individuals are included on the top left of the screen.
Participants simply click the names/labels of the individuals
to be rated and drag and drop them anywhere along the verti-
cal continuous rating scale. Once a name has been placed on
the scale, it can be moved around, placed at the same point on
the scale as another individual (e.g., see "Adam" and "Ben"
in Figure 1), or removed from the scale if the participant is
unsure of where to rate a particular individual (e.g., see
"Sara" in Figure 1). This particular scale is anchored by the
terms "The Most Extreme A-1 Person Imaginable" to "The
Most Extreme 1-A Person Imaginable," which have been
created and defined by the researcher.
The definitions for the anchors of the DAS, located on the
left side of the screen (below the instructions), are written by
the researcher based on theory. In this example, the anchors
for the Big Five traits are generic labels (e.g., A-1 vs. 1-A for
agreeable vs. disagreeable), intended to reduce the likelihood
of respondents relying on their own idiosyncratic definitions
of the trait terms. The individuals to be rated are either elic-
ited from the participant to fit a particular role description or
included in the list by the researcher. These can include any-
one of interest, such as individuals from the respondent's life
(e.g., friend, significant other, relatives), various selves (e.g.,
actual self, ideal self), reference individuals (e.g., the typical
college student), or other figures (e.g., public figures, fic-
tional characters).
Beyond traditional analog or multipoint scales, the DAS
contains several characteristics that serve as extensions of
recent research on single-item measures. First, using the
DAS, respondents rate multiple people simultaneously and

One is Enough: Single-Item Measurement
via the Dynamic Analog Scale
Erika A. Brown1 and James W. Grice1
Abstract
The Dynamic Analog Scale (DAS)--a generic and flexible technique for creating single-item measures of psychological
constructs--comprises detailed definitions and a continuous analog scale on which self and others are rated simultaneously.
Using five experimental conditions, the authors investigated the psychometric properties of the DAS as well as the
impact of different social contexts and modified Big Five trait definitions on participant ratings and their relationships to
measures of volunteerism, religiosity, affect, and alcohol consumption. Results revealed few differences across conditions, and
reliability coefficients and predictive validity estimates were similar to those typically obtained using standard, multiple-item
questionnaires.The DAS is therefore supported as a consistent and efficacious method for measuring personality traits with
single items.

can move people around during the rating process, creating a
"social network" for the respondent to rate himself or herself
within (Denissen, Geenen, Selfhout, & Van Aken, 2008). In
addition, the researcher clearly defines each pole of the con-
struct and provides these definitions to the respondent as the
basis for which the bipolar construct should be understood
(Woods & Hampson, 2005). Moreover, each pole of the con-
struct is anchored by extreme terms, so as to reduce the like-
lihood of individual differences in how the scale endpoints
are interpreted (Bartoshuk et al., 2002).
In an initial study of the validity of the DAS, Grice et al.
(2011) found that the DAS was just as efficacious as a stan-
dard multiple-item questionnaire measuring the same person-
ality traits in predicting behavioral acts, self-esteem, general
affect, and religiosity. Moreover, they reported favorable
immediate and approximate 2-week test­retest reliability coef-
ficients for the DAS.
In the current study, we more thoroughly evaluated the
properties of the DAS as a single-item technique for measur-
ing individual differences using the Big Five personality traits.
In addition to examining the immediate test­retest reliability
of the DAS, we also examined its predictive validity regard-
ing a number of well-known consequential outcomes related
to human personality. The particular criteria (volunteerism,
religiosity, affect, and drinking behaviors) were chosen from
a recent review article (see Ozer & Benet-Martínez, 2006) that
showed how well the Big Five personality traits predicted a
variety of consequential outcomes. Moreover, using a com-
plex study design, we examined the potential influence of (a)
modifying the social context component in the rating process
and (b) modifying the descriptive trait definitions used by
Grice et al. (2011) to reduce the social desirability of the trait
poles.
Method
Participants
A total of 250 undergraduate students volunteered to par-
ticipate in exchange for course credit. Complete data
were obtained for 238 participants,1 among whom 149
were female (62.6%) and 89 were male (37.4%). Of this
group, 201 reported their ethnicity as White (84.5%), 11
were Native American (4.6%), 8 were African American
(3.4%), 6 were Asian (2.5%), 2 were Hispanic (0.8%), and 10
indicated "other" (4.2%). Ages ranged from 18 to 36 (M =
19.34, SD = 2.09).
Materials
Big Five bipolar trait descriptions. Determined by the group
to which participants were assigned, they received one of two
versions of the Big Five bipolar trait descriptions (the OCEAN
or the ABCDE) when completing the DAS.
Figure 1. Example Dynamic Analog Scale for the agreeable versus disagreeable trait
Brown and Grice 3
The OCEAN is the set of original descriptions used by
Grice et al. (2011) to define each pole of the Big Five
traits (i.e., Open-Minded/Close-Minded, Conscientious/
Unconscientious, Extraverted/Introverted, Agreeable/
Disagreeable, and Emotionally Stable/Emotionally Unstable).
These descriptions were slightly modified in this study,
however, by concealing the trait names using a generic label
consisting of a capital letter either preceded or followed by
the number "1." This change was made to reduce the desir-
ability of either pole as a result of individuals' prior knowl-
edge of the Big Five trait names. The descriptions were also
modified to be more gender neutral to reduce the influence of
genderstereotyping.Withthesechangesinmind,Extraversion
(E-1),forexample,wasdescribedindistinctiontoIntroversion
(1-E) as,
An E-1 person is someone who tends to direct his or
her energy toward the external world rather than to the
inner world of ideas. Consequently, when presented
with a new situation or unfamiliar activity, E-1s tend
to jump right in without much hesitation. For instance,
an E-1 attending a Yoga class for the first time with a
friend would not hesitate to join in the exercises, or an
E-1 visiting a sports bar for the first time would not feel
uncomfortable in such a novel setting. E-1s, thus, tend
to be seen as energetic and tend to seek out activities
that involve other people. They also tend to be talkative,
even in large groups of people, and they can sometimes
appear to be aggressive when interacting with other
people, even strangers.
The ABCDE is similar to the OCEAN, except that the
generic labels were made more ambiguous to reduce the
likelihood that the traits could be guessed from the familiar
OCEAN acronym. Instead, the letters A, B, C, D, and E
replaced O, C, E, A, and N, respectively (i.e., A instead of O,
B instead of C, C instead of E, etc.). Moreover, the descrip-
tions were modified to further neutralize the traits by explic-
itly adding strengths and weaknesses to each pole. For
example, the Extraversion description was modified to read
as follows:
A C-1 person is someone who tends to direct his or her
energy toward the external world rather than to the
inner world of ideas. Consequently, when presented
with a new situation or unfamiliar activity, C-1s tend
to jump right in without much hesitation. For instance,
a C-1 attending a Yoga class for the first time with a
friend would not hesitate to join in the exercises, or a
C-1 visiting a sports bar for the first time would not
feel uncomfortable in such a novel setting. C-1s, thus,
tend to be seen as energetic and tend to seek out
activities that involve other people. C-1s' strengths are
that they tend to be relaxed in novel situations and
they can have large social networks. With regard to
weaknesses, C-1s may be too greatly influenced by
their surroundings, and they tend to develop fewer
truly intimate relationships.
Similarly,theIntroversiondescription(1-C)includedstrengths
and weaknesses.
DAS. The DAS was administered using Idiogrid Version
2.4 (Grice, 2002). To complete the DAS, participants simul-
taneously rated individuals on a scale ranging from -200 to
+200 (see Figure 1). The scale, consisting of 401 pixels of
resolution, thus represented a quasi-continuous scale. Par-
ticipants completed five scales anchored by the Big Five trait
poles. For example, one scale asked the participant to simul-
taneously rate individuals on a continuous scale ranging
from 1-C (Introversion) to C-1 (Extraversion). All partici-
pants (simultaneously) rated their actual self, and, depending
on the experimental group to which they were assigned, may
have rated their ideal self and 10 other individuals whom they
named (see below). The descriptions they were provided
on the Big Five bipolar trait descriptions (i.e., OCEAN or
ABCDE) were typed next to the respective scale to serve as a
reminder of what the generic labels stood for. Ratings were
stored in a two-dimensional matrix for analysis.
Volunteerism Questionnaire (VQ). The VQ consists of three
yes-or-no items that ask participants if they have ever volun-
teered in the past, if they are currently volunteering, and if
they plan to volunteer in the future. For each question that is
answered with a "yes," participants are asked to list each
volunteering activity, approximate dates, and how they got
involved. This questionnaire was adapted from Carlo, Okun,
Knight, and de Guzman (2005). For the current study, only the
quantity of volunteer activities per question was analyzed.
Religious Orientation Scale (ROS). The ROS (Allport & Ross,
1967) consists of 21 items regarding religious beliefs and
practices. Participants indicate the degree to which they agree
with each item using a 5-point Likert-type scale (ranging from
"strongly disagree" to "strongly agree"). Internal Religiosity
and External Religiosity scores are computed, ranging from
9 to 45 and 12 to 60, respectively, both of which have been
reported to have adequate psychometric properties for research
(Hill & Hood, 1999). For the current study, average scores
were computed for each of the subscales as a means of deal-
ing with missing data (<1% missing). In addition, one item
was dropped from the analyses due to a typographical error
that rendered the item ambiguous.
Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). On the
PANAS, participants use a 5-point Likert-type scale (ranging
from "very slightly or not at all" to "extremely") to indicate
how they feel day to day (e.g., "distressed," "excited," "enthu-
siastic,""irritable").Positiveand NegativeAffect scores are com-
puted, ranging from 10 to 50. The PANAS has been reported
to yield highly reliable and highly valid data (Watson, Clark, &
Tellegen, 1988). For the current study, average scores were
computed for each of the subscales as a means of dealing
with missing data (<1% missing).
4 SAGE Open
Daily Drinking Questionnaire (DDQ). The DDQ (Dimeff,
Baer, Kivlahan & Marlatt, 1999) asks participants to self-
report the number of alcoholic drinks they consume and the
number of hours within which the drinks are consumed each
day during a typical week. Participants also self-report on
their age, gender, weight, height, type of housing, fraternity/
sorority involvement, employment, and university enrollment.
The DDQ was adapted from the Drinking Practices Question-
naire (Cahalan, Cisin, & Crossley, 1969), with which it cor-
relates moderately.
Drinking Frequency-Quantity Questionnaire (DFQQ).TheDFQQ
(Dimeff et al., 1999) is a three-item, multiple-choice question-
naire that asks about drinking behaviors during a typical
month. For example, ranging from 1 = no drinks to 11 = 19 or
more, participants are asked to report the most alcohol con-
sumed on one occasion over the past month and how many
drinks they typically consume on the weekend. Ranging from
1 = I do not drink to 6 = once a day or more, participants are
asked to report how often they drank during the previous
month.
Procedure
Participants were randomly assigned to one of five groups:
OCEAN-10 (19 males, 24 females), Ideal OCEAN-10 (17
males, 33 females), Ideal ABCDE-10 (17 males, 30 females),
Ideal ABCDE (17 males, 33 females), or ABCDE (19 males,
29 females). Table 1 summarizes the groups. All participants
rated their actual selves using their respective set of Big Five
trait definitions (i.e., the OCEAN or the ABCDE). Participants
in the Ideal OCEAN-10 and OCEAN-10 groups both received
the OCEAN Big Five trait definitions, whereas those in the
Ideal ABCDE-10, Ideal ABCDE, and ABCDE groups received
the ABCDE trait definitions. With regard to the other rated
targets, participants in the Ideal OCEAN-10, Ideal ABCDE-
10, and Ideal ABCDE groups rated their ideal selves, and
participants in the Ideal OCEAN-10, OCEAN-10, and Ideal
ABCDE-10 groups named 10 additional people to be rated.
For those groups who were asked to rate 10 additional peo-
ple (see Table 1), participants were asked to write the first name
or role title (e.g., "mom" or "coach") of one individual whom
they know personally who fits the description of each pole of
the trait definitions (i.e., 10 total).Also, they were asked to write
a brief description as to why the elicited individual fits that par-
ticular description (e.g., "He can't stand being alone" or "She
loves being the center of attention" for an extraverted person).
Each of the elicited individuals served as a "marker person" (see
Grice, Jackson, & McDaniel, 2006) for each pole of the Big
Five traits and also provided researchers the opportunity to
ensure the participants truly understood the descriptions.
Participants worked in small groups of up to four indi-
viduals at computer stations separated by divider panels.
Participantsreceivedindividualinstructionsfromthe researcher,
could work at their own pace, and were blind to the other
conditions. On arrival, all participants filled out basic demo-
graphic information and were then given the Big Five bipo-
lar trait descriptions for their respective group (i.e., Ideal
OCEAN-10 and OCEAN-10 participants were given the
OCEAN; Ideal ABCDE-10, Ideal ABCDE, and ABCDE par-
ticipants were given the ABCDE). Participants were given as
much time as they needed to thoroughly read through each
description. During this time, participants in those groups
asked to rate 10 additional people elicited the names of these
"marker people" for each trait pole. Next, participants
watched a short video demonstrating how to rate individuals
using the DAS. After completing the DAS, participants filled
out the remaining inventories (including the VQ, ROS,
PANAS, DDQ, and the DFQQ). Finally, participants com-
pleted the DAS a second time, rating the same individuals on
the same five constructs as they had previously.
Results
Consistency of the DAS
The participants' self-ratings were consistent across the two
administrations of the DAS, with all Pearson product­
moment correlation coefficients greater than .70 (Median =
.83). Table 2 summarizes the correlation coefficients for
each of the five groups (Ideal OCEAN-10, OCEAN-10, etc.).
Overall consistency of each participant's responses between
the first and second administrations of the DAS could also
be computed using Slater's General Degree of Correlation2
(see Grice, 2002) because each participant rated the same
individuals on the same constructs for both grids in all but the
ABCDE group. The obtained correlation for each participant
typically ranges in value from 0 to 1 (although in rare cases
the observed value can fall outside of this range), with
higher values indicating higher levels of overall consistency
between the two grids. Median correlations for each group

indicated high levels of overall consistency in participants'
ratings. Specifically, a median correlation of .87 was found
for individuals in the Ideal OCEAN-10 group (minimum =
0.26, maximum = 0.95, M = 0.82, SD = 0.12); .87 for the
OCEAN-10 group (minimum = -0.06, maximum = 0.97, M
= 0.79, SD = 0.22); .81 for the Ideal ABCDE-10 group
(minimum = 0.06, maximum = 0.94, M = 0.76, SD = 0.18);
and .80 for the Ideal ABCDE group (minimum = 0.15, maxi-
mum = 1.00, M = 0.76, SD = 0.24).3 Given the high degree
of consistency between the two administrations of the DAS
(between the self-ratings in particular as well as the grids
overall) and the similar direction and magnitude of results
obtained from using either set of ratings, only the ratings
from the first DAS administration will be reported in the
subsequent analyses.
Comparisons Between Groups
The current study sought to investigate whether modifying
(a) the trait definitions used in the DAS and (b) the number
of people simultaneously rated by the participants would
influence the ratings of their actual self in any way. The mean
actual self ratings from each of the five conditions were com-
pared using one-way ANOVAs on each of the Big Five per-
sonality traits. The results indicated that, across the five
conditions, the participants' self-ratings did not differ signifi-
cantly from one another on any of the Big Five traits (all Fs
< 2.39, ps > .05, 2 < .04), other than neuroticism, F(4233) =
4.12, p = .003, 2 = .07. Table 3 reports descriptive statistics
for the actual self ratings for each trait by group. For neu-
roticism (bolded in Table 3), results from Tukey's HSD post
hoc analysis revealed that those individuals who read the
modified trait definitions (including strengths and weak-
nesses) and who also rated their ideal self and 10 other indi-
viduals (i.e., those individuals in the Ideal ABCDE-10
condition) rated their actual self as more emotionally unsta-
ble than those individuals who read the original trait defini-
tions (i.e., conditions Ideal OCEAN-10 and OCEAN-10).4
Regression Analyses
Multiple regression analyses were conducted to test the
unique predictive capacity of the Big Five traits using the
external criteria (volunteerism, religiosity, affect, and drinking
behaviors) as the dependant variables.5 Because a major aim
of the current research was to investigate any differences that
may arise as a result of the five groups, each of the models
was evaluated for each group separately. To determine
whether significant differences existed between the groups,
the obtained Multiple R values were subjected to Fisher's
well-known formula for comparing two independent correla-
tions.6 Beyond merely noting the statistical significance of
these comparisons, what is truly of interest here is the magni-
tude discrepancies of each pair of R2 values. Each group's
Multiple R2 values and  weights (for each of the Big Five
traits) are reported in Table 4 for each of the models. Each
model was evaluated for violations of statistical assumptions,
and examination of the residuals revealed no anomalies.
Past volunteerism was significantly predicted (R2 =
.236, p = .032) by extraversion ( = .407, p = .005) in the
Ideal OCEAN-10 group. However, although the model
was only significant for the Ideal OCEAN-10 group (all
other R2s < .188, p > .05), there were no significant differ-
ences between the Multiple R values for any of the five
groups (all zs < 1.14). In predicting current volunteerism,
the multiple regression model was not significant for any
of the five groups (R2s < .127, p > .05), and there were no
differences between the Multiple R values for any of the
five groups (all zs < 1.11). Similarly, planned future vol-
unteerism was not predicted significantly in any of the
groups (R2s < .203, p > .05), and there were no differ-
ences in the Multiple R values between any of the groups
(all zs < 1.37).
The model for internal religiosity was not significant for
any of the five groups (R2s < .211, p > .05), and there were
no differences in the Multiple R values (all zs < 0.73). Results
for external religiosity were significant for the ABCDE group
(R2 = .275, p = .016), with conscientiousness being the only
significant predictor ( = .380, p = .007). Again, there were
no group differences in the Multiple R values (all zs < 1.53).
With regard to the two affectivity scales, positive affect
was significantly predicted (R2 = .240, p = .035) by conscien-
tiousness ( = .325, p = .021) and neuroticism ( = -.339, p =
.018) in the ABCDE group. Positive affect was also signifi-
cantly predicted (R2 = .377, p = .003) by conscientiousness
( = .406, p = .004) and extraversion ( = .348, p = .016) in the
OCEAN-10 group. Moreover, a significantly greater amount
of variance was accounted for in the OCEAN-10 (R2 = .377,

p = .633), z = 2.04, p = .04 (all other zs < 1.85). Negative
affect was significantly predicted (R2 = .349, p = .006) by
agreeableness ( = -.379, p = .008) and neuroticism ( =
.418, p = .004) in the OCEAN-10 group; yet, there were no
significant differences in the Multiple R values for the five
groups (all zs < 1.35).
The estimated number of drinks consumed in a typical
week was not significantly predicted for any of the five
groups (R2s < .140, ps > .05). The model for the estimated
number of drinks consumed on the typical weekend was also
not significantly predicted for any of the five groups (R2s <
.203, ps > .05). Likewise, the model for the highest number
of drinks consumed in the past month was not significant for
any of the five groups (R2s < .193, ps > .05). Moreover, the
analyses for the three drinking behavior­dependent variables
yielded Multiple R values that were not significantly differ-
ent between any of the five groups (all zs < 1.38).
The pattern of predictive values across groups was exam-
ined by comparing each group's R2 values for each of the
10 external criteria to the 10 R2 values in each other group
(e.g., the R2 values for Ideal OCEAN-10 were compared with
the R2 values for OCEAN-10) using the Gower similarity
coefficient (Barrett, 2010b)--a coefficient that indicates the
magnitude of similarity between pairs of observations. From
the Gower coefficient matrix in Table 5, it can be seen that the
five conditions yielded highly similar R2 values, with a mean
similarity of 92% between the pairs of observations (SD =
0.01, Median = .92, minimum = 0.90, maximum = 0.94).
Furthermore, bootstrapping (Barrett, 2010a), generating
10,000 Gower coefficients, revealed that obtaining a Gower
coefficient equal to or greater than the lowest observed Gower
coefficient (.90) was highly unlikely to occur by chance alone
(p < .001).
Discussion
The results from this study support the use of the DAS as a
means for measuring individual differences in personality
traits with a single item. Participants were highly consistent
between the first and second administrations of the DAS in
terms of their actual self ratings and their grids overall.
Moreover, participants who were asked to rate 10 additional
individuals consistently rated these "marker people" (see
Grice et al., 2006) on the appropriate trait pole for which
they were elicited (95.78% of the time for Ideal OCEAN-
10, 94.35% for OCEAN-10, and 93.81% for Ideal ABCDE-
10). Furthermore, the standard deviations were large enough
to show that participants were using the full length of the
scale range, showing some variability in their ratings
between themselves as well as the other individuals that
were rated. All this suggests that the participants understood

the procedures and were able to complete them appropri-
ately, with ease and in a timely manner.
Furthermore, a primary aim of the current study was to
address (a) the impact of rating only oneself versus oneself
along with other individuals (by varying the social network of
the five groups) and (b) the issue of social desirability that is
often present in rating oneself on the Big Five traits, a notion
that is supported by Bäckström's (2007) recent higher-
order factor analysis of the Big Five factors. The modified
definitions were designed to include strengths and weaknesses
(i.e., adaptive and maladaptive qualities) of both poles of each
trait, so as to neutralize them to a degree and reduce the social
desirability in rating oneself on one pole over the other.
Statistical analyses revealed that, across the five condi-
tions, the mean rating of participants' actual selves were not
significantly different from one another for any of the Big
Five traits, except for neuroticism. For neuroticism, those
participants in the Ideal ABCDE-10 group tended to rate
themselves as significantly more emotionally unstable than
those individuals in the Ideal OCEAN-10 and the OCEAN-10
groups, but not significantly different from the Ideal ABCDE
and ABCDE groups. Interestingly, all three conditions with the
modified trait definitions had a positive mean neuroticism
score, whereas the two conditions with the original trait defini-
tions had mean neuroticism scores in the opposite direction
(i.e., negative). This unusual finding was replicated in another
sample of individuals using the modified trait definitions.
These findings suggest that, at least for neuroticism, adding
strengths and weaknesses to each pole (i.e., emotional sta-
bility and emotional instability) may have had the desired
effect of reducing the social desirability of rating oneself as
emotionally stable. Of less importance was the social context
within which participants rated themselves. In other words,
the finding appears to be linked more so to the trait definitions
they were given, rather than to whether they were asked to rate
their ideal self or other individuals in addition to their actual
self. One avenue for future research would be to investigate
this finding further with neuroticism as well as the other traits
to potentially reduce the influence of social desirability of a
particular pole on participants' responses.
As evaluating the predictive validity of single-item mea-
sures is an essential step in assessing their efficacy (Burisch,
1997), multiple regression analyses were conducted for each
group. Although the regression models were arguably under-
powered and most were nonsignificant, the primary interest
in these analyses was not the statistical significance of the
models. Rather, the discrepancies of the R2 values between
the five groups were the primary concern here. With one
exception, there were no differences between the five groups
in how well the outcomes (volunteerism, religiosity, affect,

and drinking behavior) were predicted; and the Gower coef-
ficients indicated that the R2 values were highly consistent
across the five groups. These results suggest that, on the
whole, modifying the trait definitions by adding strengths and
weaknesses and modifying the social network within which
participants rated their actual selves did not significantly
affect how the consequential outcomes were predicted.
Furthermore, the DAS yielded results comparable with
those typically obtained by studies that use more traditional
multiple-item measures of the Big Five (such as the BFQ and
NEO) in predicting such consequential outcomes as past vol-
unteerism, external religiosity, and positive and negative
affect (see Ozer & Benet-Martínez, 2006). For example, in
their meta-analysis examining personality as a correlate of
subjective well-being, DeNeve and Cooper (1998) found
that negative affect correlates .05 with openness to experi-
ence, -.10 with conscientiousness, -.07 with extraversion,
-.13 with agreeableness, and .23 with neuroticism. Results
from the DAS, across the five groups, similarly showed that
negative affect correlates -.01 with openness to experience,
-.10 with conscientiousness, -.14 with extraversion, -.13
with agreeableness, and .28 with neuroticism. The magnitudes
of the effect sizes were thus entirely consistent with those
obtained in other studies using common multiple-item mea-
sures (see also Carlo et al., 2005; Grice et al., 2011), and the
results consequently indicate that the DAS is just as effective
as more traditional techniques in predicting consequential
outcomes. The results also serve as a reminder, however, that
trait psychologists often deal in small effect sizes when dis-
cussing predictive validity.
Despite that neither technique--the DAS nor multiple-
item questionnaires--appears to be superior to the other,
there are some aspects of the DAS that distinguish it from
the more conventional methods. The DAS is a simple rat-
ing technique that is completed in a timely manner, and it
affords the researcher more control over the rating process
through a variety of channels. First, rather than relying on
the assumption that all participants will understand an item in
the intended manner, the researcher is capable of clearly defin-
ing the subtleties of a particular construct to better ensure that
the construct is understood in its intended manner. Second, the
researcher is able to manipulate labels for the pole anchors.
For example, recent research has used such anchors as "exces-
sively extraverted" and "excessively conscientious" to inves-
tigate personality disorders as extreme manifestations of
dimensional personality traits (Mullins-Sweatt, Jamerson,
Samuel, Olson, & Widiger, 2006). Third, the researcher is
capable of creating the participants' reference group during
the rating process by deciding the number of additional peo-
ple to be rated and who these individuals will be. This also
provides intriguing data (other than only the actual self) that
could be analyzed without participants being asked to com-
plete the same measure separately for each target individual.
Last, participants reported enjoying the interactive nature of
the DAS and the ability to rate multiple people simultane-
ously. This is an important consideration, particularly when
participants are asked to complete multiple questionnaires
or the same questionnaire multiple times for different people
(e.g., actual self and ideal self).
In sum, the DAS has been evaluated as a single-item tech-
nique for measuring the Big Five personality traits in this study
as well as the two studies reported in Grice et al. (2011). The
overarching conclusion to be drawn from these investigations
is that multiple items may not be necessary when measuring
human personality traits--they can be measured just as well
with only one item, and the DAS is a feasible approach for
doing so. Using a single item, the DAS yields reliability and
validity coefficients equal to those obtained using multiple
items. Coupled with the benefits of only using one item (e.g.,
more control over defining the item, brevity and simplicity
of the task), it stands to reason that single-item measurement is
at least as valuable as multiple-item measurement. Given the
amount of success that other researchers (e.g., Barrett & Paltiel,
1996; Bergkvist & Rossiter, 2007; Butt et al., 2008; Nagy, 2002)
have had in measuring other constructs with a single item, it
should come as no surprise that personality traits can also be mea-
sured using one item just as effectively as using multiple items.

3. To investigate the potential influence of individuals with low
levels of consistency (<.30), analyses were conducted with and
without these individuals. There were 13 participants whose
10 SAGE Open
consistency values (Slater's General Degree of Correlation or
Pearson's product­moment correlation coefficient) were low;
one from Ideal OCEAN-10, three from OCEAN-10, two from
Ideal ABCDE-10, four from Ideal ABCDE, and three from
ABCDE. Because there were very few differences in the two
sets of results, these individuals were retained in the subse-
quent analyses.
4. In response to this unusual finding, a replication study of 44
individuals randomly assigned to the Ideal ABCDE-10, the Ideal
ABCDE, or the ABCDE condition was conducted. Mean neu-
roticism scores (with SDs in parentheses) for each of the respec-
tive conditions were 10.73 (119.13), 23.93 (104.58), and 50.93
(127.08), mimicking the direction with a somewhat stronger
magnitude of the effect using the modified trait definitions.
5. Bivariate correlations between participants'DAS ratings on the
Big Five traits and the external criteria (from the Volunteerism
Questionnaire, Religious Orientation Scale, Positive Affect
Negative Affect Schedule, Daily Drinking Questionnaire, and
Drinking Frequency-Quantity Questionnaire) are available on
request from the first author.
6. Recall that Multiple R is a standard product­moment correlation
between participants' observed (Y) and predicted () scores on
the criterion.
