Introduction
In recent years, an important area of filial contention had
appeared as a result of Chinese women marrying later in life
following their rising educational levels and professional sta-
tuses. While some argued that later marriages reflected mod-
ern career women's more "individualized" attitudes (Beck &
Beck-Gernsheim, 2002; Giddens, 1992), others found that
this was caused by men's discrimination against high-achiev-
ing women who deviated from traditional domestic roles,
thus rendering them "leftover" in the marriage market To,
2013, 2015). Regardless of the cause of Chinese women's
later marriages, it would lead to the same consequence--the
chagrin and opposition of Chinese parents ( To, 2013, 2015;
Zhang & Sun, 2014). Given that marriage was a collective
affair that came with the obligation of furthering one's fam-
ily lineage according to the Confucian tradition, parents still
expected their children to marry and to choose a high-status
marriage partner who could benefit the whole family and its
future generations. While there had been many studies on the
"filial strategies" performed by Chinese adult children in
more traditional areas of filial contention such as elderly care
(Lan, 2002) and mother- and daughter-in-law relations (Shih
& Pyke, 2010), there had been none that explored the "mari-
tal filial strategies" of unmarried Chinese women.
According to Anthony Giddens (1991, 1992), individuals
who made more reflexive choices independent of external
obligations would be able to enjoy more personal satisfac-
tion compared with those whose choices were made to sat-
isfy others. This theory of "individualization" incited much
controversy among "cultural pessimists" in the West
(Bauman, 2003) and the East (Yan, 2003) who were con-
cerned that traditional values like social cohesion and filial
piety would be lost. However, large-scale empirical studies
by Whyte (2004) and Hu and Scott (2014) revealed that the

"My Mother Wants Me to Jiaru-haomen
(Marry Into a Rich and Powerful Family)!":
Exploring the Pathways to "Altruistic
Individualism" in Chinese Professional
Women's Filial Strategies of Marital
Choice
Sandy To1
Abstract
In an era of individualization, Chinese individuals often have to face the challenge of balancing their personal choices with
their filial obligations. While a host of "filial strategies" are well-documented in traditional areas of filial contention such as
elderly care and relating with in-laws, there are none in the area of sheng nü or "leftover women's" marital choices. This
study sets out to explore the "marital filial strategies" of unmarried Chinese professional women who face filial contentions
in their "marriage timing" and "partner choice." It was found that the combination of the filial strategies of "deferring" to
parents' matchmaking demands, followed by "negotiation" of one's partner choice, led to the ideal condition of "altruistic
individualism" that "combined personal freedom with engagement with others." On a wider level, sheng nü's filial strategies
of marital choice could serve as an exemplar for all modern Chinese individuals who strove to conduct congenial filial
relationships without compromising their own ideals.

younger generation of Chinese individuals actually exempli-
fied equally strong, if not even stronger, proclivities toward
filial piety than older generations. Moreover, Hu and Scott
further showed how Chinese women who enjoyed enhanced
educational and career opportunities were only "selectively
detraditionalized" from their "patrilineal beliefs" but not
from "filial piety" (p. 21). This concurred with To's (- 2013,
2015) previous research that showed how sheng nü were
unrelenting in their struggle against patriarchal constraints
imposed by their male partners and suitors but were guilt rid-
den and agonized over how their relationship choices affected
their parents.
It is important to point out that having the noble intention
to observe filial piety did not necessarily mean that one's
choices concurred with one's parents'. This could be due to
intergenerational differences in values. The struggle and
adjustment that were associated with asserting one's own
individual choices and fulfilling one's parents'demands con-
stituted the core of all "filial strategies." For instance, indi-
viduals who had conflicting work-lifestyle habits and
schedules with their parents' were found to hire domestic
helpers from their parents' hometowns who spoke the same
language to take care of them, which would bring about a
higher degree of compatibility (Lan, 2002). Or daughters-in-
law who experienced conflicts with their mothers-in-law
would perform various filial strategies to alleviate their con-
flicts, such as acting more docile in front of their mothers-in-
law or asking their husbands to play the mediating role (Shih
& Pyke, 2010).
Suffice it to say that the main objective of all filial strate-
gies was to find the most satisfactory balance between assert-
ing one's own choices and fulfilling filial obligations. Ulrich
Beck and Elisabeth Beck-Gernsheim (2002) proposed the
concept of "altruistic individualism" that was about
"combin(ing) personal freedom with engagement with oth-
ers" (p. 162). The aim of this article would be to explore the
pathways or "marital filial strategies" performed by sheng nü
that could lead to this ideal balance and theoretical condition.
By providing an exploratory theoretical account of filial
strategies, this study would go beyond a mere descriptive
account of filial strategies that was found in previous qualita-
tive studies (Lan, 2002; Shih & Pyke, 2010). This article will
begin with a brief history of individualization in the context
of contemporary China, followed by a discussion of the theo-
retical framework, methodology, and empirical outcomes.
Intergenerational Relations in China:
From Familism to Individualism
Pre-modern imperial China had been governed by the
Confucian philosophical thought for over a thousand years.
Under Confucian doctrine, human relations were under-
pinned by a distinct hierarchy, and there were five basic
types of relations known as the "five cardinal relations" that
included "those between father and son, ruler and subject,
husband and wife, older and younger brother, and between
friends" (Stockman, 2000, p. 71). Conforming to the appro-
priate behaviors, attitudes, and decorum that were associated
with one's position in the social hierarchy was essential for
maintaining the whole country's order (Whyte, 2004). The
pecking order of social relations was "generation, age, and
sex" (Baker, 1979) that meant that men and the elderly had
the most power, and women and children were in positions
of subordination. One of the core values in the Confucian
doctrine was hence "filial piety," meaning "children's uncon-
ditional obedience and respect for their parents" (Yan, 2003,
p. 172). Besides providing physical care and financial sup-
port to their parents in their old age, individuals were also
expected to obey their parents in all aspects of their personal
lives, such as in their education, career, and marital choices
(Stockman, 2000). Because parents gave children the "gift of
life" (Yan, 2003, p. 88), which was the biggest gift one could
ever receive in one's lifetime, children were expected to
spend their entire lives repaying their parents through mate-
rial and non-material means, and failure to do so would ren-
der one "unfilial" or "immoral."
However, in the late imperial era, educated scholars and
urbanites became concerned that Confucian familistic values
had an insular effect and were a hindrance to China's mod-
ernization on the worldwide economic and political scale,
and they initiated the May Fourth Movement to fight for
their own rights to make free choices in marriage, education,
and career (Stockman, 2000). This revolution was unstruc-
tured and participated in by an intellectual few, but later on in
the Maoist socialist era of 1949, there was the New Marriage
Law of 1950 that officially abolished arranged marriages and
granted all individuals the right to choose their own marriage
partners. The state also allocated jobs and accommodation to
individuals in various urban work units known as danwei,
and this had greatly diminished their reliance on their parents
for economic support. The result was that youths were
encouraged to live on their own and to make their own per-
sonal lifestyle decisions independently from their parents at
a much earlier stage in life.
These acts of individualization that were set in motion in
the Maoist era continued to exert their influences in the
post-Mao reform era, as individuals were still legally free
to choose their own marriage partners. Owing to the relax-
ation of migration laws since 1981, it became the common
practice for many youths to leave their homes and families
in the countryside to pursue their education and careers in
the cities (Yan, 2009). Moreover, China's transition to a
capitalist market economy led to the termination of "pater-
nalistic" socialist welfare benefits, and this, according to
Yunxiang Yan (2010), further propelled individuals to
develop their own self-actualizing tendencies for personal
survival and sustenance, albeit this being a more involun-
tary kind of individualization compared with the "first
stage" of individualization from parental rule that occurred
in the Maoist era.
To 3
The Challenge of Pursuing Individual
Choice and Fulfilling Parental Demands
Despite past efforts of the Maoist regime to enhance indi-
viduals'autonomy, and the capitalist economy's push toward
more individualized practices, Chinese individuals contin-
ued to observe the traditional virtue of filial piety (Hu &
Scott, 2014; Whyte, 2004). Nevertheless, there were still
bound to be some individual cases of "unfilial" behavior
exemplified by those who chose to pursue their own personal
goals at the expense of their parents'feelings and well-being.
One such example was where individuals who migrated from
the villages to the cities to pursue better educational and
work opportunities rarely went back to visit their parents
(Yan, 2003). In Yan's (2003) study on the Xiajia village in
Northern China, he found a number of elderly villagers who
were abandoned by their children who left the village and
never returned. There were also those whose children did
return, but it was for the utilitarian purpose of asking them
for financial support. In the most extreme cases, elderly par-
ents who did not have the means to support their adult chil-
dren were even physically and emotionally abused (Yan,
2003, 2009).
Another controversial aspect of individualization had to
do with the One Child Policy in 1979 and how it produced
generations of "spoilt" only children. It was believed that
parents' excessive doting and concentration of material
resources on their only children had led them to become self-
centered and "unfilial" (Fong, 2004). One extreme example
found in Fong's (2004) study on only children who came of
age in the 1990s was when one boy in secondary school
threatened to abuse and abandon his mother in the future
when she demanded that he study for his university entrance
exams, as he was aware that he was his mother's "only child"
and "only hope." However, it was important to note that
Fong's study was conducted on only children who were in
secondary school at the time, and it was difficult to tell
whether they would grow up to become filial or not based on
interviews with them in their childhood. It may well be that
their "spoilt" or "unfilial" behavior was only a vent for their
exam frustration and did not reflect their actual behavior
toward their parents in their adulthood.
On the other side of the coin, there were parents who
intervened too much in their children's lifestyle choices,
thus depriving them of any autonomy in their own personal
lives. One example was when parents sought to control
their daughters' marital choices, which often led to devas-
tating results (May, 2010). In Shannon May's (2010) study
on a poor Northeastern Chinese village, she found that it
was a common practice for parents to arrange for their
daughters to go work in a more prosperous city with the
objective of finding a man to marry there and consequently
improving their whole family's livelihood. Most of these
attempts were unsuccessful given how low the probability
rate of "chancing on" eligible men was, and thus these
daughters returned to their villages with tainted reputations
(May, 2010). The most unfortunate ones were those who
found a village man to marry, but then found themselves
unsuited to the rustic lifestyle after their stint in the city,
and they would end up abandoning their husband and chil-
dren for city life (May, 2010).
As illustrated in the above cases, neither the extremes of
being "too self-centered" and "unfilial" nor being "too
acquiescent" and "unreflexive" would lead to desirable out-
comes. This showed how finding the right balance between
observing filial obligations and asserting one's own choices
was crucial and necessary in modern intergenerational
relationships.
Altruistic Individualism
In response to the moral dilemmas induced by individualiza-
tion, Ulrich Beck and Elisabeth Beck-Gernsheim (2002) pro-
posed the theory of "altruistic individualism" that was about
"combin(ing) personal freedom with engagement with oth-
ers" (p. 162). "Individualization" was deemed as a kind of
"institutionalized individualism" by Beck and Beck-
Gernsheim, as they believed that it was an inevitable and
inexorable process that was generated by the wider institu-
tional changes in highly developed societies under global
capitalism. Due to the overdevelopment of late modern soci-
eties, a profusion of unintended consequences had emerged
that rendered many previous institutions such as welfare sys-
tems, educational and occupational systems, and family sys-
tems dysfunctional. Having lost their previous bearings,
individuals were forced to rely on their own "reflexivity" and
self-actualizing spirit to resolve their own practical and exis-
tential dilemmas. This individualizing process was consid-
ered to be a positive one by Beck and Beck-Gernsheim
(2002) as they believed that heightened human reflexivity
could have the potential to rectify existing socioeconomic
and ecological problems and improve the overall human
condition:
The decline of values which cultural pessimists are so fond of
decrying is in fact opening up the possibility of escaping from
the creed of "bigger, better, more" in a period that is living
beyond its means ecologically and economically. It is particularly
the apostles of the status quo who grumble that individualization
means egocentrism . . . While in the old values systems the ego
always had to be subordinated to patterns of the collective (also
always designed by individuals), these new orientations towards
the "we" create something like a cooperative or altruistic
individualism. Thinking of oneself and living for others at the
same time, once considered a contradiction in terms, is revealed
as an internal, substantive connection. Living alone means
living socially. (p. 162)
Beck and Beck-Gernsheim (2002) also equated individu-
alization with "detraditionalization," implying that departure
from obsolete moral reference points was not negative as the
4 SAGE Open
"cultural pessimists" augured, as new values and reference
points were now needed to contend with new and ever-pres-
ent dilemmas. They believed that "reflexivity" could be
unleashed when individuals were "detraditionalized" from
their outmoded ways, and it was a crucial component that
was needed to create new modes of living and thinking. In
other words, "reflexive individualization" was beneficial to
individuals on a personal level, as it could lead to heightened
self-awareness and the resolution of personal and social
dilemmas. Under the new ethics of "altruistic individual-
ism," both the "self" and "others" would ultimately benefit,
and cooperation between the two was the way toward sur-
vival in the late modern era (Beck & Beck-Gernsheim,
2002).
A Continuum of Individualization
Carol Smart and Beccy Shipman (2004) conducted a study
on second-generation Indian, Pakistani, and Irish youths in
Britain to gauge the extent to which they adhered to tradi-
tional values while growing up in a Western society. Their
area of inquiry was "marriage partner choice" given the
prominence of marriage in South Asian and Irish cultures
that were more family oriented. They found that these youths
enacted a range of different filial strategies that could be cat-
egorized into three different types on a "continuum of
individualization."
On one end of the "individualization continuum" were the
youths who performed the strategy of "compliance" by hav-
ing their marriage partners arranged by their parents. When
asked about his reason for entering into an arranged mar-
riage, one Pakistani youth responded in a "matter of fact"
way (Smart & Shipman, 2004, p. 9), implying that he never
thought of what type of wife he wanted to have. It happened
that he glimpsed his wife in a family wedding video and mar-
ried her out of convenience ("I didn't mind actually 'cos I
actually saw her in my cousin's wedding film so when I was
asked I said yes I would marry that girl"; Smart & Shipman,
2004, p. 8). Smart and Shipman (2004) considered those who
chose arranged marriages to be the "least individualized," as
arranged marriages were "a long way away from the basic
tenets of the individualization thesis where it (was) held that
people (sought) marriage partners who fulfil(ed) a psycho-
logical and emotional need or gap in the psyche of the single
person" (p. 9).
On the other end of the individualization continuum were
the youths who performed the strategy of "negotiation" when
their partner choices conflicted with their parents' expecta-
tions. An Indian youth wanted to marry an Indian girl who
was from a different religion, but he knew his parents would
disapprove. He hence negotiated his future childrearing
plans with his parents, which was to pass on his religion to
his children to prevent it from being lost. In this way, he
hoped that he could preserve his relations with his parents
and his choice of partner.
Another case of negotiation was a Pakistani girl who
decided that she was not interested in any of the men her
parents introduced to her within her extended family, so she
negotiated with them by citing examples of her cousins who
were in love marriages with partners found on their own. By
negotiating her choice to have a love marriage with her par-
ents, she hoped to "sustain good relations" with them "while
embracing some degree of cultural shift" (Smart & Shipman,
2004, p. 13). These youths who negotiated their differences
with their parents were seen as the "most individualized," as
they had chosen partners who could fulfill their own "psy-
chological and emotional needs" instead of the needs of their
parents.
In the middle of the individualization continuum were
those youths whose choices "agreed" with their parents' by
coincidence. For instance, there was an Irish girl who chose
a husband on her own who was also Irish and Catholic, and
he happened to fit with her parents' traditional expectations.
These individuals were described as "mildly individualized"
in that they demonstrated reflexivity in their partner choices,
yet they did not have to face the challenge of defending their
choices to their parents.
The Study: Method and Data
The 14 informants of this study were derived from a wider
study of 50 never-married Chinese professional women
interviewed in Shanghai from December 2008 to January
2011. Highly educated unmarried women who were over the
age of 27 were branded as sheng nü or "leftover women" in
China (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of
China, 2007), and their marital prospects were highly scruti-
nized and speculated. The objective of the wider study was to
investigate the marriage views and partner choices of 50
unmarried professional women using a grounded theory and
symbolic interactionist approach ( To, 2013; Corbin &
Strauss, 2008; Strauss & Corbin, 1990, 1994). The interac-
tions between the women and their male partners are dis-
cussed in another article ( To, 2013). This article will discuss
the interactions between the women and their parents.
The 14 informants in this article were aged 27 to 31 and
they were from Shanghai, Hong Kong, Nanjing, Harbin,
Jiangsu, and Henan. They were all managers and profession-
als working in Shanghai in the fields of law, finance, adver-
tising, information technology, media, retail, and
manufacturing. Six of them had master's degrees and three
of them were educated in overseas institutions in the United
Kingdom and Australia. These women who had high educa-
tional qualifications and professional statuses were represen-
tative of the new group of upper middle-class elites who
successfully capitalized on the new opportunities of post-
reform China (Hanser, 2002) and could afford to make indi-
vidualized lifestyle choices (Giddens, 1991, 1992).
The informants were gathered by snowballing from my
own personal contacts in Shanghai, and then subsequently
To 5
from several professional networking bodies such as the
Shanghai Oxford and Cambridge Society (SOCS; previously
"CamOx"), the Overseas Chinese Network (OCN), which was
a professional networking group for expatriate professionals
of ethnic Chinese descent, and a private finance professionals'
networking group. The women were interviewed in their
offices, homes, coffee shops, and restaurants, and their inter-
views lasted on average 50 min. All of the interviews were
recorded after gaining permission from the informants, and
they were transcribed verbatim by me. The informants were
told that they would be given pseudonyms to protect their con-
fidentiality, and that the names of their companies and other
identifying information would not be disclosed.
The interview schedule was semi-structured, and new
questions were added onto it at each new stage according to
the evolving theoretical needs of the study (Charmaz, 2006).
Sampling and coding were conducted at four different stages
in the wider study, and the first three pertained specifically to
gauging the filial dynamics between the women and their
parents. The first and last stages were aimed at gauging the
gender dynamics between the women and their male part-
ners, and are described in detail in another article ( To, 2013).
In the pilot stage of sampling, a set of guiding questions
were devised to preliminarily gauge the women's marriage
views, to "determine the dimensions and boundaries . . . of
the project" (Morse, 2007, p. 235).1 This sample consisted of
20 tertiary-educated women and men who were married,
unmarried, divorced, and separated, and in the age range of
27 to 59. On coding and analysis of their interviews using
ATLAS.ti (used in all four stages), I narrowed down the sam-
ple to include only never-married women who were in the
age range of 28 to 33 because these informants had the most
interesting and relevant courtship experiences. I eliminated
the men from the sample because their views did not contrib-
ute much to the understanding of women's views toward
marriage, and I narrowed down the age range because the
disparities in marriage views had been too great between dif-
ferent cohorts, and exploring cohort differences was not my
objective. Eventually 9 of these 20 informants were retained
in the final sample.
The codes that emerged from the analysis of the first set
of interviews were found to contain many instances of par-
ents'demands and expectations when it came to the women's
marital choices. As a result, new filially related questions
were added onto the interview schedule in the second inter-
viewing stage:
1. Did their parents want them to get married?
2. Did their parents ever introduce any partners to them?
What criteria did these men possess?
3. Did they ever have any conflicts with their parents
regarding their partner choices?
In view of these filially related questions, new informants
who encountered parental interventions in the areas of
"marriage timing" and "partner choice" were purposefully
sourced in the manner of "purposeful sampling" (Morse,
2007). This second sample consisted of 16 informants, and
all of them were retained in the final sample.
Deriving the Filial Strategies From the Codes
Eventually, the filial codes that emerged from the first two
stages of coding were developed into more analytical "con-
ceptual categories" with the technique of "constant compari-
son" that entailed comparing the codes and the data against
each other, the data against data, and codes against codes
(Corbin & Strauss, 2008; Strauss & Corbin, 1990, 1994).
The main filial conceptual categories were "parental influ-
ences on women's marriage timing" and "parents' emphasis
on the economic status of women's partners."2 To fill in the
dimensions and properties of these two filial conceptual cat-
egories, "theoretical sampling" was performed in the third
stage to "seek participants who have had particular responses
to experiences, or in whom particular concepts appear(ed)
significant" (Morse, 2007, p. 240). In the third sampling
stage, 17 informants who had the more specific experience
of "matchmaking" in which parents introduced partners to
them of similar family and economic background were inter-
viewed, and all of them were retained in the final sample.
The fourth and final stage of theoretical sampling was
conducted to fill in the properties and dimensions of the gen-
der conceptual categories,3 and women who were at the top
of their professions were sourced, as they were postulated to
have the most difficulties in bridging their economic gaps
with their male suitors and partners. Eight women were
interviewed in this final stage, and a total of 50 informants
were gathered in all four stages.
Finally, all of the filial conceptual categories and remain-
ing filial concepts were integrated into the conditional/con-
sequential matrix (Corbin & Strauss, 2008; Strauss & Corbin,
1994) that elucidated their relationships and associations.
The two main filial conceptual categories of "parental influ-
ences on women's marriage timing" and "parents' emphasis
on the economic status of women's partners" were the "filial
constraints" against which the women made their marital
choices. In response, the women enacted various "filial strat-
egies" that could be broadly categorized into "deference,"
"negotiation," and "coincidence." For instance, when in the
face of the filial constraint of one's parents disagreeing with
one's choice of partner who had lower economic status, some
women would heed their parents'demands and break up with
their partner ("deference"), some would break up with their
partner because they shared the same views as their parents
("coincidence"), or some would try to persuade their parents
to accept their partner ("negotiation").
Adopting Smart and Shipman's (2004) "continuum of
individualization," the filial strategy of "deference" would
be found at the "least individualized" end; "coincidence"
would be found in the middle, representing "neutrality"; and
6 SAGE Open
"negotiation" would be found at the "most individualized"
end (see Figure 1).
Given how this study's aim was to illustrate the process of
finding a balance between asserting one's individual choices
and fulfilling parental demands, or achieving "altruistic indi-
vidualism," only those informants (14) who experienced
some form of filial contention in their marital choices in the
areas of "marriage timing" and/or "partner choice" would be
included, and their filial strategies of "deference" and/or
"negotiation" (not "coincidence") would be discussed below.
Findings
"I Went Matchmaking for My Parents' Sake!"--
"Deference" as a Filial Strategy
Actually I didn't really intend to find someone in the first place,
but my parents wanted me to get married very early. When I
didn't have a boyfriend, my mom would keep saying to me,
"You're getting older and it'll be very difficult to find someone!"
And that if I don't get married, I'll be very lonely for the rest of
my life. So she hoped that I could find someone very early on. I
went matchmaking for my parents' sake, so that they won't
worry. I personally think that I'm happy being by myself. I have
a lot of friends and activities. I'm living a happy life. (Have you
explained to your mom that you're happy being alone?) It won't
work, she won't understand . . . We're from different generations
so it's difficult to make her understand. (Vera, 30, technology
analyst)
Vera, a 30-year-old technology analyst in a multinational
beverage company, was found to have had the same "mar-
riage conversation" with her parents as many of the unmar-
ried women. It could be seen how marriage was still
considered to be a significant rite of passage that most
Chinese adult children were expected to follow in the eyes of
their parents. Women were especially expected to marry, as
they traditionally belonged in the domestic sphere and were
regarded as dependents of men. Hence, Vera's parents who
were more traditional would expect her to follow the tradi-
tional path, and their biggest fear would be that she did not
marry and had no one to take care of her in the future.
Vera, who also planned to marry eventually, did not plan
to do so that soon. But knowing how her parents felt worried
about her future, she was willing to "defer" to their expecta-
tions to expedite her marriage timing. Vera's parents also
worried that the longer she waited, the more difficult it would
be for her to find a man. Seeing how Vera was already 30
years old and without any marriage prospects, her parents
arranged for her to go to more than 10 matchmaking ses-
sions. As it was, Vera did not manage to find a partner at
matchmaking, and she ended up finding someone on her own
on a matchmaking website. This greatly satisfied her parents,
as they were relieved that their daughter's marital future
would soon be secured.
Giselle, a Hong Konger based in Shanghai for the past 5
years running her family's retail business, had not been in a
serious relationship since she moved there. Although she
eventually wanted to get married and have a family, she felt
that it was not the right time given how she had just achieved
some success in her career. It had taken her a long time to
learn the ropes of her family business since she moved to
Shanghai, and now was finally the time she could savor the
fruits of her hard work and bask in the self-sufficiency that
came with it. But apparently, her father had a different opin-
ion, as he thought that a woman's career was nowhere near
the importance of her marriage. He felt tremendously guilty
for having "jeopardized" his daughter's marriage chances by
asking her to devote herself to developing his business.
Giselle took it as a sign that he wanted her to shift her priori-
ties, and she "deferred" to his wishes:
My dad usually doesn't talk about these things, but last year he
told me that he thinks he spoiled my chances by sending me to
work in Shanghai. I said no, because I like working here. I
wasted a bit of time at the beginning but I was very satisfied
when I saw the results. I've changed a lot. I know what I want
more and I won't wait for other people to give me happiness.
I'm happy that I can do my own thing. That brings me happiness
too. But after my dad talked to me about it--with tears in his
eyes--I started to seriously think about my love life, if I should
really start dating more. I mentioned this to friends and they
started to introduce guys to me. I started to date a lot more.
(Giselle, 29, general manager of her family business)
As her father did not have any eligible partners to intro-
duce to her, Giselle turned to her friends for introductions.
She hoped that she could soon find a suitable partner to expe-
dite her marriage plans and assuage her father's guilt.
Winnie, a 28-year-old assistant brand manager at a global
consumer products company, was strongly averse to the
pragmatic nature of matchmaking, as it reminded her of

"buying pork at the butcher's" where all candidates' external
criteria were "put on the table first" before they even met.
Nevertheless, Winnie still went matchmaking several times
at the demand of her mother:
My mom asked her friend to introduce some guys to me. I think
there's a very big difference between matchmaking and dating
someone you met on your own . . . In matchmaking you get to
know someone's criteria first. I've been to matchmaking three to
four times. Men look at women's appearance first, to see if
they're pretty or not. For the women, they don't even have to ask
about the economic background of the men, as the introducer
would automatically tell them that this guy is very accomplished,
he's from what university, what education level, and if he has a
house or a car. In matchmaking, you put all of each other's
criteria on the table. And if they fit your requirement, then you
go on to see if your personalities are compatible and if you can
develop feelings for each other. I think it's too practical that way.
(Winnie, 28, assistant brand manager)
Even though Winnie was against the pragmatic nature of
matchmaking, and would rather find a partner on her own,
she still "deferred" to her mother's demand and went "three
to four times." However, Winnie's matchmaking episode did
not end here, as it would be revealed later on that she adopted
a different filial strategy when facing her mother's formida-
ble partner choice criteria.
The same could not be said for Nancy, a 28-year-old IT
consultant, as she "deferred" to her parents' choice of man
whom she did not find so agreeable:
They're really satisfied with him but I don't think we are the
same type of person. (Why?) Mainly because of work nature. He
works in a local company. His way of thinking and the situations
he has to handle are completely different. At my age I can't
spare a lot of time and energy to try to understand what he's
thinking about. I just think that he's very different from me in
the way he thinks and does things. (Do you see each other all the
time?) Not a lot. We talk a bit every day and see each other once
a week. (Only once a week?) Yes, because I think we both have
the same mentality; that we're not that compatible, but because
our parents introduced . . .. (Nancy, 28, IT consultant)
Nancy confessed that she and her boyfriend both felt that
they were not that suitable for each other, and that they were
only together because their parents were good friends. It was
obvious that Nancy would not choose someone like him if
they had met under normal circumstances:
My parents know his parents. They used to be my father's old
schoolmates, and he knows that they are very good, kind people.
They think that if I marry into their family I will have very kind
and honest mother and father-in-laws. Their way of thinking is
very simple. (Nancy, 28, IT consultant)
Nancy believed that obeying her parents in every aspect
of her personal life was the best form of repayment for their
painstaking upbringing. This was seen as a "purest" form of
filial piety where one considered it to be their lifelong objec-
tive to repay their parents for their "gift of life" (cf. Yan,
2003, p. 88). For the sake of her parents, Nancy was willing
to sublimate her individual desires, but having made such
compromises for the collective good, she could not help but
feel ambivalent about her future marital happiness:
I can give myself time but my parents would be under a lot of
pressure. (So you will put their wishes first?) Yes, because my
parents sacrificed a lot for me and my sister. They've given us all
the money they have. I don't need to find someone who's
extremely compatible with me, or someone who's exactly like
myself. I don't think that's necessary. I think that what my parents
say usually make a lot of sense. (Do you think you'll be happier
married than you are now?) I don't know, it's very hard to say. It
may be better or it may be worse. I can't just run in one direction.
I have to learn how to be a good partner, a good mother, and I
have to learn how to be accountable to my parents and society. I
have to consider these things. (Nancy, 28, IT consultant)
"Luckily My Family Wasn't Very Hard-Headed
and I've Always Been Allowed to Express My
Views"--"Negotiation" as a Filial Strategy
Yes, my mother does want me to jiaru-haomen (marry into a
rich and powerful family). Those families would usually want to
manage their daughters-in-law's life paths. They would tell them
what to do, like where to go study and where to go to work. I
can't accept that. (Ingrid, 28, accountant)
Ingrid, a 28-year-old accountant with a law master's
degree, had a mother who had incredibly high expectations
for her partner's economic criteria. Ingrid would rather find
someone who was from a more similar family and economic
background, as she thought that they could find more affinity
with each other in terms of lifestyle and values, but her
mother believed that hypergamy, or marrying up, could bet-
ter secure her daughter's future livelihood.
Ingrid's mother would hence "sift through the candidates
first" to pick out only those who fulfilled the "most basic"
criteria of "having a house and a car." Ingrid was against the
pragmatic nature of matchmaking, but she still went to sat-
isfy her mother. Eventually, she did manage to meet a candi-
date whom she liked, but her mother was still not satisfied,
and asked her to go meet even more well-off men:
My father is pleased because his daughter found someone she
likes. But my mother still thinks that I can find someone better.
She wants me to observe a bit longer and get to know him more.
Actually when we first met, my mother was still introducing
men with better criteria to me. There was one who liked me but
I didn't like him, so I told my mother that I like the other one
more. But that guy was very accomplished. He had a house, a
car, and was a senior manager in a big company. (Ingrid, 28,
accountant)
8 SAGE Open
Even though Ingrid eventually "negotiated" with her
mother to retain her original partner choice, she still went to
meet the other well-off candidates on her mother's demand.
She could not help stressing the impressive economic criteria
of one of the other candidates, not because she admired him,
but because she knew that choosing him would please her
mother more. Nevertheless, after much struggle between
retaining her own personal choice and satisfying her mother,
Ingrid decided that fulfilling her mother's "most basic" part-
ner choice criteria of "having a house and a car" (which her
boyfriend had because he was "sifted through" by her mother)
was already good enough in terms of showing her filiality.
In the last section, Winnie was found to "defer" to her
mother's demand for her to go matchmaking, even when it
was against her own preference. However, when it came
down to her actual partner choice, she refused to "defer" to
her mother's choice of a nouveau riche candidate:
I met this guy who was very accomplished. He had his own
business in Shanghai and had three to four houses, all luxury
apartments. He had many expensive cars . . . I went out with him
for a few times; three times in total, and then I said I can't do it
anymore. (You had nothing to say?) Having nothing to say was
one thing . . . the feeling I got from him was that he thought that
a girl like me with rather good criteria would be looking for a
rich man to marry, that I was after his money. He kept bragging
about how rich he was in front of me. He would tell me what
brands of clothes he bought; that it cost several tens of thousands
(of yuan), and that he was the VIP of this brand, and he gave
them several hundreds of thousands (of yuan) in business. I
wasn't very happy with all of that. He was quite inconsiderate.
He would ask me to go buy something with him. (Is it for you?)
No, not for me, but for himself. He'd take me to a brand name
store to go shopping for himself, like LV (Louis Vuitton) or
Bally. Even if he did buy things for me, I wouldn't dare accept
as my mom would scold me. I'm not that greedy. Whenever
we'd go into a shop, those salespeople would give us weird
looks, like we're from different worlds. He'd act like a big boss,
telling people to get this and that for him . . . He took off his
shoes. After that I really thought I couldn't do this anymore. He
acted like he owned the shop. There were some chairs in the
shop, and mannequins were sitting on it, with scarves and other
accessories. He'd sit on top of them. There were sofas in the
shop as well, he should've sat on those. It was so embarrassing.
The salespeople would stare at us. I'd ask him to sit on the sofa,
but he wouldn't listen to me. I really hated that. After that I told
my mom that I couldn't see him again. She said forget it, as it
was all too scary. (Winnie, 28, assistant brand manager)
Eventually, Winnie decided that she could no longer toler-
ate the vulgar and inconsiderate actions of her nouveau riche
suitor, and she "negotiated" with her mother to terminate her
courtship. She realized that her mother cared more about her
feelings than her being with someone who was extremely
wealthy, and that her mother would never force her to go
along with something she felt so uncomfortable with, if only
she had told her earlier. However, the fact that it had taken as
much as three whole dates for Winnie to decide to terminate
her courtship with the insufferable man showed how she
really took her mother's wishes into account. In the end, after
heartfelt communication, both Winnie and her mother came
to the conclusion that someone like that would not be a good
choice for Winnie, no matter how superior his economic cri-
teria were.
There were cases where women who met partners on their
own did not satisfy their parents' partner choice criteria. One
such case was Bernice, a 28-year-old telecommunications
manager who met her boyfriend at work. Unlike those who
met their partners at matchmaking, it was more difficult to
guarantee that partners met on one's own would fulfill the
specific criteria that parents looked for. Bernice's boyfriend
was an accomplished software engineer, but her parents were
looking for someone who was from a more prominent family
background, given how prestigious theirs was. The lacking
of this criterion in Bernice's boyfriend caused many conflicts
between her and her parents over the years:
B: At first they didn't quite accept my boyfriend, so when
they heard we broke up, they were so happy and imme-
diately introduced other guys to me. But afterwards
they gave up because they knew we always got back
together.
S: They didn't like your boyfriend before?
B: Yes, for a lot of reasons. They think he's a bit effemi-
nate; also because our two families aren't very men-
dang-hudui (of similar backgrounds).
S: Yours is better?
B: Yes, they want me to find someone who's from a simi-
lar or better background.
S: But he's capable himself, no?
B: Yes, but my family looks at family background more. I
don't know if it's like this in other places, but over
here, marriage is an affair between two families. Even
if they think this person is good, they want to know
more about his family, where they're from and what
his parents do.
S: What do his parents do?
B: His parents run a store.
S: What do your parents do?
B: My grandfather is deceased, but if he were here, we'd
be a typical "government-business" combination. My
grandfather was a government official and my grand-
mother does business. We're still running the business
now. (Bernice, 28, telecommunications manager)
Over the years, Bernice's parents had introduced many
other candidates from more prominent family backgrounds
to her, even during the course of her relationship with her
boyfriend. However reluctant she was, Bernice still agreed to
meet these other men, which was a sign of "giving face"' to
her parents and taking their wishes into account. But eventu-
ally, she mustered up the confidence to "negotiate" with her
To 9
parents about their different values and to make them under-
stand why she chose her boyfriend:
I don't care that much about where they're from or what their
family background is. I just look at that person himself, whether
I like him or not. I never ask about what their family does or if
they're rich or not. My ex-boyfriend was even worse off than
this one! (Bernice, 28, telecommunications manager)
Bernice's "negotiation" strategy paid off, and she was
finally able to persuade her parents to stop introducing other
men to her. Admittedly, Bernice had to have had consider-
ably reasonable and open-minded parents who were willing
to negotiate with her in the first place. If her parents ada-
mantly insisted that she find a man from a more prominent
family background, she would have had a much more diffi-
cult time struggling to assert her own personal choice and
fulfilling her filial obligations. Perhaps it could be surmised
that her parents' living far away in Jiangsu made them more
tolerant and understanding of her situation, as they did not
have a chance to see her and her boyfriend that often. As it
was, their distance could be said to have played a large part
in alleviating their filial conflict:
Actually I was the one who insisted in the first place. My family
was quite against it, they wanted to break us up. I was very
persistent about it. Luckily my family wasn't very hard-headed
and I've always been allowed to express my views.Anyway, I'm
in Shanghai and they don't come to Shanghai that often.
(Bernice, 28, telecommunications manager)
Discussion and Conclusion
The two main areas of filial contention faced by 14 sheng
nü were "marriage timing" and "partner choice." It was
found that their parents generally wanted them to marry
earlier and to find a husband with high economic status, but
this may not cohere with their own life plans or partner
choice criteria. To resolve their filial contentions, the
women performed the "marital filial strategies" of "defer-
ence" and/or "negotiation."
It was interesting to note that filial contentions in "mar-
riage timing" and "partner choice" elicited different filial
strategies. Most women who chose to "defer" to their parents'
matchmaking demands (to marry earlier or to find a high(er)
status partner) would "negotiate" their actual partner choices
in the end. For instance, Winnie who thought that the idea of
matchmaking was too pragmatic (like "buying pork from the
butcher's") still went to satisfy her mother, but she refused to
yield to her mother's choice of a nouveau riche candidate,
and negotiated with her mother to terminate her courtship.
Similarly, Bernice and Ingrid also went matchmaking at their
parents'/mother's demand, but ended up negotiating with
them to retain their choices of less prominent or well-off men
than their parents/mother hoped for. These instances of
"deferring" first and then going on to "negotiate" suggested
how filial obligations were observed to a certain extent to
which the women felt were reasonable and acceptable, but
they would not go as far as to compromise their own inner-
most needs and wants. This satisfactory balance that was
found between filial obligations and personal choices exem-
plified the ideal condition of "altruistic individualism" that
entailed "combin(ing) personal freedom with engagement
with others" (Beck & Beck-Gernsheim, 2002, p. 162). By
showing a high degree of individual reflexivity regarding
their own partner choices, these women would be on the
"most individualized" end of the "integrated continuum of
individualization" (see Figure 2).
In contrast, if "deferring" and then "negotiating" demon-
strated the merits of achieving "altruistic individualism,"
those who performed the filial strategy of "deference" in
both "marriage timing" and "partner choice" would be seen
as lacking reflexivity, and as Giddens (1991, 1992) sug-
gested, they would not be postulated to achieve much indi-
vidual satisfaction from choices that were made to satisfy
others instead of themselves.
Nancy was an example of one who "deferred" to her par-
ents' partner choice even when she knew he was "not her
type." If given the choice, she would have chosen someone
who was more compatible with her in terms of personality
and work interests. However, she chose to fulfill her parents'
expectations instead of her own as a form of repayment for
their lifelong upbringing. Repaying parents for their "gift of
life" was deemed as a "purest" and most traditional form of
filial piety (Yan, 2003, p. 88). Nancy's abidance by this vir-
tue was indeed invaluable and commendable, especially
being someone from the "individualized" modern genera-
tion. However, on the downside, she had effectively let her
"obligations to defer to parental wishes trump (her) own per-
sonal desires and preferences" (Whyte, 2004, p. 120). By
deferring completely to her parents' partner choice, she

would be on the "least individualized" end of the "integrated
continuum of individualization" (see Figure 2).As Smart and
Shipman (2004) maintained that arranged marriages were "a
long way away from the basic tenets of the individualization
thesis where it (was) held that people (sought) marriage part-
ners who fulfil(ed) a psychological and emotional need or
gap in the psyche of the single person" (p. 9), it was under-
standable that Nancy would have serious doubts about her
future marital happiness. ("I don't know, it's very hard to say.
It may be better or it may be worse.")
There were those who performed the filial strategy of
"deference" (only), but did not exactly belong in the category
of "least individualized." Those were Vera and Giselle who
"deferred" to their parents'/father's wishes to expedite their
marriage timing even when they felt unready to do so at their
own pace. Vera went matchmaking for over 10 times on her
parents' demand, and eventually found a partner on a match-
making website on her own. This satisfied her parents all the
same, as they appreciated the idea of her getting married over
any specific partner choice criteria. Giselle's father did not
have anyone to introduce to her, so she turned to her friends
for help. So far, it was not known whether Giselle would suc-
ceed in finding a partner through her friends' introductions.
Because Giselle had not reached the stage where she had
a partner for her parents to evaluate, she did not need to
"negotiate" or "defer" in terms of "partner choice," and
would therefore be deemed as "mildly un-individualized"
based on her strategy of "deference" in "marriage timing"
(see Figure 2). However, if she did find a partner in the
future, there would be possibilities of gravitating toward the
"most individualized" end if her parents disagreed with her
partner choice and she chose to "negotiate" with them, or
toward the "least individualized" end if she chose to "defer"
to her parents' partner choice and compromise her own.
Thus, it could be seen how for some women who were in the
beginning stage of their marital trajectory (at "marriage tim-
ing"), their individualizing tendencies would be open to
much variation. In other words, "mildly un-individualized"
would not necessarily be their final destination. But for those
like Vera who did reach the latter stage of her marital trajec-
tory wherein she found a partner on a matchmaking website
who satisfied her parents, "mildly un-individualized" would
in fact be her final destination, as she did not face filial con-
tention in the area of "partner choice" and hence did not have
the option to further "defer" or "negotiate."
It was interesting to note that not one of these women
above "negotiated" in the first stage of "marriage timing,"
which could well suggest that all of them eventually wanted
to get married, despite feeling "not quite ready" or being
against the pragmatic nature of matchmaking. Hence, it did
not take much swaying by parents for one to decide to expe-
dite one's marriage timing, and "deferring" would not be
seen as conflicting too much with one's long-term marital
goals. However, when it came down to actual "partner
choice," only the staunchest observers of filiality would
"defer" to parental expectations and sacrifice their own need
for "emotional and psychological" fulfillment (Smart &
Shipman, 2004, p. 9).
In the past, there had been many studies that investigated
the filial strategies of modern Chinese individuals in the
areas of caring for elderly parents (Lan, 2002) or relating
with in-laws (Shih & Pyke, 2010), but there had been none
that investigated the filial strategies of unmarried Chinese
professional women known as sheng nü or "leftover women"
who faced filial contentions in their marital choices. This
study has provided both an empirical and theoretical account
of the "marital filial strategies" performed by sheng nü and
their pathways to achieving "altruistic individualism," that
is, finding the most satisfactory balance between their own
individual choices and fulfilling filial obligations. On a wider
level, their experiences could serve as an exemplar for all
modern Chinese individuals who strove to conduct congenial
filial relationships without compromising their own ideals.
Notes
1. These questions were generated from a review of the literature
on the impact of women's economic status on their marriage
chances, in line with the wider study's objective of explor-
ing single professional women's marriage views and partner
choice. These guiding questions were as follows: (a) Did the
women want to get married in the first place? (b) If yes, then
what obstacles did they face? (c) What types of partners were
they looking for?
2. Other lesser filial conceptual categories were "parents against
Western partner," "parents against partner being too old," and
"parents against partner being divorced/having children from
previous marriage." In comparison, the categories related to
"partner's economic status," and the women's own "marriage
timing" far outweighed the others and were thus chosen for
analysis.
3. The gender conceptual categories were "men's discrimination
against accomplished women" and "men's control over wom-
en's work-lifestyle choices" ( To, 2013, p. 9).
