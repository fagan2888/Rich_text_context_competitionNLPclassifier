Cross-Sectional Associations of Asthma, Hay Fever, and Other Allergies with
Major Depression and Low-Back Pain among Adults Aged 20-39 Years in the
United States
Eric L. Hurwitz and Hal Morgenstern
Although low-back pain and depression are common comorbidities, the mechanisms responsible for their
association remain unclear. The effects of proinflammatory cytokines on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis lead to the hypothesis that allergic reactions, as markers for inflammation-associated activation of
the HPA axis, result in aberrant responses to subsequent stressors. Data from 6,836 US adults 20-39 years old
from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) were used. Subjects responded
to questions regarding low-back pain in the past 12 months and history of asthma, hay fever, and other allergies.
The history and onset of major depression were obtained from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Logistic
regression modeling was used to estimate the associations between allergies and depression and low-back
pain. Subjects with a history of any allergy were more likely to report low-back pain (odds ratio = 1.51; 95%
confidence interval: 1.16, 1.96), to be diagnosed with major depression (odds ratio = 1.58; 95% confidence
interval: 1.13, 2.21), and much more likely to have both major depression and low-back pain (odds ratio = 3.03;
95% confidence interval: 1.32, 6.92). Hypersensitivity reactions may prime the HPA axis to respond aberrantly
to stressors, resulting in physical and behavioral consequences. Am J Epidemiol 1999; 150:1107-16.

Although low-back pain and depression are two of
the most common and costly conditions among
patients seeking medical care (1, 2), their etiologies
and relation to each other are poorly understood.
Many investigators have found cross-sectional and
longitudinal associations between low-back pain and
depression in clinic-based (3-7), occupational
(8-10), and population-based (11-16) studies.
However, the biologic and psychosocial mechanisms
responsible for the apparent link remain unclear
(17).
There is recent evidence that interleukin-ip (IL-IP)
may be involved in the neurochemical link between
depression and pain. IL-lp is the principal component
in the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis during immune responses and inflamma-
tory reactions (18). IL-ip induces the hypothalamus to
release corticotropin-releasing hormone, which causes
the direct release of pituitary adrenocorticotropin hor-

mone. Mechanical or psychologic stress also causes
the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone and
sensitizes the pituitary gland to release adrenocorti-
cotropin hormone in response to IL-lp, which may
result in an exaggerated glucocorticoid response (19).
Hypercortisolemia may be an important factor con-
tributing to the onset or maintenance of depression
(20). Hypersecretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone
has been shown to cause long-term physiologic and
behavioral changes, including aberrant responses to
acute stimuli (21), changes in brain IL-ip expression,
and excessive IL-ip production from macrophages
(22). IL-lp stimulates the production and release of
substance P in sympathetic neurons (23) and has been
shown to be correlated with fear reactions (24) and
depression (25).
Depression and pain may be independent effects of
abnormal responses to mechanical or psychologic
stress resulting from alterations in the HPA axis caused
by early exposure to IL-ip. IL-ip exposure early in
life has been shown to have long-lasting effects on the
HPA axis of mice (26), and the HPA axes of rats
exposed to IL-lp as adults show hyperactive responses
to subsequent IL-lp exposure (27). Since allergy suf-
ferers secrete proinflammatory cytokines, including
IL-ip, in much greater quantities than do nonsufferers
(28), we propose that allergic reactions, as markers for
1107
1108 Hurwitz and Morgenstern
inflammation-associated activation of the HPA axis,
induce changes in the HPA axis resulting in hyper-
active responses to subsequent mechanical or psycho-
social stressors. We hypothesize that major depression
and low-back pain are two outcomes affected by the
abnormal responses to these stressors.
The objective of this study is to estimate the associ-
ations between allergic conditions, including asthma,
hay fever, and allergic reactions, and recent major
depression and low-back pain in a representative sam-
ple of adults 20-39 years old in the United States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data source and subject selection
We used data from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES m), which
was conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics from 1988 to 1994 (29, 30). NHANES m is
based on a complex sample design with oversampling
of certain groups (31). Sample weights are used to
adjust for differential selection probabilities, noncoverage,
and nonresponse so the weighted sample is designed to
represent the civilian noninstitutionalized population
of the United States (31). Of the 39,695 persons
selected, 33,994 were interviewed (86 percent) and
30,818 agreed to be examined (78 percent of all per-
sons selected) (31).
This analysis uses data from the 6,836 adults 20-39
years old who were interviewed and eligible for the
examination component of NHANES HI. The history
and current status of asthma and hay fever were
assessed by asking each subject, "Has a doctor ever
told you that you had asthma?" and "Has a doctor
ever told you that you had hay fever?" Subjects
responding affirmatively to either of these questions
were then asked, "Do you still have asthma (or hay
fever)?" and "How old were you when you were first
told you had asthma (or hay fever)?" Four additional
questions addressed histories of allergic reactions. AH
subjects were asked, "Within an hour after receiving
allergy shots or allergy tests, have you ever had a
severe reaction, such as itching all over, trouble
breathing, flushing, hives, or swelling of the face or
hands or feet?" and "Have you ever given up or had
to avoid a pet because of allergies?" Respondents
from Phase 1 (1988-1991) were asked, "Have you
ever had a severe reaction, such as itching all over,
trouble breathing, flushing, hives, or swelling of the
face or hands or feet within an hour after being stung
by an insect?" Respondents from Phase 2
(1991-1994) were asked a similar question regarding
severe allergic reactions occurring within an hour
after eating something.
Outcome variables
A lifetime history of major depression and a history
of depression in the past 12 months were obtained
from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule, which was
administered to subjects 15-39 years old (32). Of
those 20-39 years old, 272 subjects (3.4 percent) failed
to complete the depression-related sections of the
Diagnostic Interview Schedule. The diagnosis of
major depression was based on criteria A and B of the
definition of a major depressive episode from the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (33). Criterion A is "dysphoric mood or loss
of interest or pleasure in all or almost all usual activi-
ties and pastimes"; criterion B calls for the presence of
at least four of the following eight symptoms during a
depressive episode: 1) appetite or weight change; 2)
insomnia or hypersomnia; 3) loss of energy, fatigue; 4)
agitation or retardation; 5) loss of interest in sex; 6)
feeling worthless or guilty; 7) trouble thinking, con-
centrating; and 8) thoughts of death or suicide.
Depressive subjects were asked the age at which then-
first and last major depressive episodes occurred.
Respondents 20 years old or older were asked to
respond to questions regarding back pain. They were
asked if they ever had pain in their back on most days
for at least 1 month, have they had this pain within the
past 12 months, and in what part of the back the pain
is usually located. (Respondents were asked to locate
the area of pain on a diagram of the back.)
Respondents reporting pain in the low back within the
past 12 months were classified as having low-back
pain. Of the 20- to 39-year-old respondents, 22 (0.3
percent) did not answer these questions.
Statistical methods
Weighted binary logistic regression modeling was
used to estimate the associations between each type of
allergy and allergic reaction and recent major depres-
sion and low-back pain (in separate models). Weighted
polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate
associations between allergies and the combination of
major depression and low-back pain. Subjects were
categorized into four outcome groups: neither major
depression nor low-back pain (treated as the "reference
group"), major depression alone, low-back pain alone,
and both major depression and low-back pain. The
final weights, which were scaled down so that the sum
of the weights was equal to the unweighted sample
size (n = 6,836), were used for all analyses. Since
NHANES El uses a complex sample design involving
both clustering and stratification, estimated crude odds
ratios, odds ratios adjusted for the effects of con-
founders, and 95 percent confidence intervals were

obtained using SUDAAN software, which has the
capability of estimating complex sample variances
(34). SAS software was used for preliminary statistical
analysis (35).
Logistic models with the allergy-related variable as
the only predictor were fit to estimate crude associa-
tions between allergies and depression and low-back
pain. Two additional models were chosen to obtain
associations between each type of allergy and each
outcome controlling for potential confounders. Model
1 includes the allergy-related variable plus age, sex,
and race. Model 2 includes the allergy-related variable
plus age, sex, race, education, marital status, and
employment status.
RESULTS
Characteristics of subjects
The study population comprises 6,836 respondents
aged 20-39 years. Table 1 shows the number and
weighted percentage of the respondents by selected
variables. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule was
completed by 6,574 subjects, and 6,814 responded to
the back pain questions in the adult interview. Lifetime
major depression was diagnosed in 526 subjects; 366
subjects had a major depressive episode within the 12
months preceding the examination. Low-back pain in
the past 12 months was reported by 949 respondents.
Among the respondents who were interviewed and
examined, 284 had major depression without low-back
pain, 845 had low-back pain and no diagnosis of major
depression, and 81 had both major depression and
low-back pain during the preceding 12 months (table
2). The odds of having low-back pain were 65 percent
greater for subjects with major depression in the past
12 months than for subjects with no major depressive
episodes (odds ratio = 1.65; 95 percent confidence
interval: 1.06,2.56).
Lifetime histories of asthma and hay fever were
reported by 436 and 599 respondents, respectively.
Severe reactions from insect stings and food were
reported by 284 and 263 respondents, respectively. Of
the 3,587 respondents who received allergy shots or
tests in their lifetimes, 127 reported having severe
reactions. A total of 302 respondents reported having
to avoid pets because of allergic reactions. A history
of any allergy was reported by 1,455 respondents
(table 2).
Table 3 shows the number and weighted percentage
of respondents by type of allergy and low-back pain
and major depression status. Respondents with a his-
tory of any allergy were more likely to report low-back
pain in the previous 12 months than were respondents
without an allergy history (19.6 percent vs. 13.7 per-
cent). Respondents with an allergy history were also
more likely to be diagnosed with major depression in
the past 12 months than were those without an allergy
history (8.1 percent vs. 5.0 percent). Among the 73
subjects with histories of asthma or hay fever and
major depression in the past 12 months, 57 (78.1 per-
cent) had allergic symptoms prior to their first lifetime
major depressive episode (allergic symptoms preceded
or were simultaneous with the most recent depressive
episode in 100 percent of these subjects).
Associations between allergic conditions and
low-back pain and major depression
Table 4 shows the estimated crude and adjusted
associations between each allergic disease or reaction
and self-reported low-back pain in the past 12 months.
The associations adjusted for age, sex, and race
(model 1) and the associations adjusted for age, sex,
race, education, marital status, and employment status
(model 2) were not appreciably different from each
other or different from the crude associations. The
associations were also similar when major depression
was added to the model (data not shown). The odds of
having low-back pain were about 50 percent higher
among respondents with a history of allergies than
among those without an allergy history (table 4). The
estimated associations between any lifetime asthma or
hay fever history and low-back pain were not appre-
ciably different from the associations between current
and past histories of asthma and hay fever (vs. no his-
tories) and low-back pain (data not shown).
Table 5 shows the estimated crude and adjusted asso-
ciations between each allergic disease or reaction and
major depression in the past 12 months. The associations
between allergies and major depression were slightly
attenuated when adjusted for age, sex, and race (model
1) and somewhat amplified when adjusted for age, sex,
race, education, marital status, and employment status
(model 2). The associations were essentially unchanged
when low-back pain was added to the model (data not
shown). Respondents with a history of any allergy or
allergic reaction had a 58-87 percent greater odds of
having major depression in the past 12 months than did
respondents wim no history of allergies (table 5). The
estimated associations between any lifetime asthma or
hay fever history and major depression were not appre-
ciably different from the associations between current
and past histories of asthma and hay fever (vs. no
histories) and major depression (data not shown).
Tables 6 and 7 show the estimated crude and
adjusted associations, respectively, between each aller-
gic disease and the combination of major depression
and low-back pain in the past 12 months. The esti-
mated crude associations were not appreciably differ-

ent from the associations adjusted for age, sex, and
race (model 1), which show that respondents with a
history of any allergy or allergic reaction had a 43 per-
cent greater odds of having low-back pain alone, 39
percent greater odds of having major depression alone,
and 203 percent greater odds of having both low-back
pain and major depression (vs. no low-back pain and
no depression) than did respondents without an allergy
history. The estimated associations adjusted for age,
sex, race, education, marital status, and employment
status (model 2) were stronger, with the association
between having a severe reaction from an allergy shot
or test and the combination of both low-back pain and
major depression within the past 12 months being par-
ticularly strong (odds ratio = 8.69; 95 percent confi-

States. The current study, to our knowledge, is the first
to report such findings. The consistency of the associ-
ations across both long-term allergic conditions and
short-term allergic reactions, as well as the finding of
associations for currently asymptomatic asthmatics
and hay fever sufferers, suggests that factors related to
the hypersensitivity reactions themselves, rather than
the clinical allergic conditions, are responsible for the
pain or depression. Although we found moderate asso-
ciations between allergies and depression and low-back
pain and stronger associations between allergies and
both depression and low-back pain, consistent with a
common underlying mechanism, the NHANES III
data do not allow for the identification of the specific
biochemical and behavioral pathways Unking hyper-
sensitivity reactions with pain and depression.
The likely mechanism involves one or more prod-
ucts associated with the inflammatory response and
their actions, either directly or indirectly through other
mediators, on the central nervous system. The differ-
ence in reported pain and depression between allergy
sufferers and nonsufferers may be due, at least in part,

its concomitant effects. Alternatively, allergic reactions
may be markers for prenatal or early childhood stress-
induced IL-ip secretion and consequent HPA-axis
dysregulation (26). Schmidt et al. hypothesize that
"inflammation-associated acute activation of the HPA
axis may induce delayed and long-lasting changes in
the HPA axis that serve to remodel the immune
responses to later challenges" (27, p. 7424).
IL-lp and other cytokines contribute in inducing the
hypothalamus to secrete corticotropin-releasing hor-
mone. In addition to causing the release of adrenocor-
ticotropin hormone and (3-endorphin from the pituitary
gland, corticotropin-releasing hormone also activates
the locus ceruleus-norepinephrine system, which leads
to catecholamine secretion and further activation of the
hypothalamus to release corticotropin-releasing hormone.
Aberrant elevation of HPA-axis responsiveness and
altered serotonin responses during acute stress have
been shown to follow corticotropin-releasing hormone
hypersecretion (21). Increases in corticotropin-releasing
hormone have been associated with behavioral adapta-
tions, including depression, which may then continue to
activate the hypothalamus and consequent corti-
cotropin-releasing hormone release (36). The natural
histories of low-back pain and major depression may be
explained, at least in part, by alterations in HPA-axis
function through the action of cytokines and/or other
immune factors. Variation in HPA-axis responsiveness
could be a factor in the development of chronic pain
and major depressive episodes, and temporal alter-

ations in HPA-axis function could help to explain the
recurrent nature of these conditions.
Although the importance of psychologic variables in
back and other musculoskeletal pain outcomes has
been demonstrated in many longitudinal studies (4-16,
37-40), depression or psychologic distress has been
found to precede pain in some studies (8, 14, 16, 41),
and pain has been shown to predict depression in other
analyses (7, 11, 14), our findings suggest that pain and
depression are two effects resulting from alterations in
the same underlying biologic mechanism, rather than
comorbidities with dependence only through their
effects on each other. This interpretation is supported
by recent findings of strong cross-sectional and
prospective associations between allergic disorders
and depression and physical illness (42).
Limitations of our study include the cross-sectional
design, reliance on self-reports for allergy and
low-back-pain data, no information regarding the
clinical nature and severity of the low-back pain, no
validation of Diagnostic Interview Schedule-based
major depression, and temporal ambiguity between
allergic reactions and the onset of depression and
low-back pain. Subjects with depression or low-back
pain may have inaccurately recalled having asthma or
hay fever, or they may have exaggerated the severity
of allergic reactions compared with those without
low-back pain or depression, resulting in possible
bias due to differential misclassification. These
respondents may have also been more likely to have
sought care for prior allergies and, thus, more likely
to have been diagnosed with asthma or hay fever.
Although the potential for bias in this study cannot be
ruled out, the consistency of the associations for
many types of allergies and allergic reactions, the
observation of associations for both current and past
asthma and hay fever sufferers, and the finding that
asthma and hay fever preceded the first lifetime
major depressive episode in almost 80 percent of sub-
jects afflicted with allergies and recent depression
provide some assurance that misclassification and
other biases are probably not responsible for the
observed associations. However, lack of data on specific
immune and neuroendocrine factors, lack of testing
for HPA-axis function, and lack of information on
mechanical and psychosocial stressors that may be
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 150, No. 10, 1999
Allergies, Depression, and Low-Back Pain 1115
associated with low-back pain and depression onset
preclude the identification of the specific mechanisms
responsible for the observed associations.
Two of the most common conditions among patients
in primary care, low-back pain and depression, may be
caused, in part, by the delayed effects of cytokines
released during allergic or other inflammatory reactions.
This mechanism may be responsible for the relatively
poor outcomes associated with most therapies for
chronic low-back pain. If the findings from this study
are replicated and the effects of IL-ip on the HPA axis
are confirmed in other studies, investigators must
determine if the HPA-axis responses can be attenuated
through behavioral, drug, or other interventions. The
effects of coping strategies and other psychosocial pre-
dictors on pain chronicity, recurrence, and depression,
and their relationship to IL-ip and other biochemical
factors, should be addressed in large, long-term
prospective population-based studies.
