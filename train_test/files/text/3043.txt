Tract Infections, and Bronchitis

Context.--The spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is associated with antibiotic
use. Children receive a significant proportion of the antibiotics prescribed each year
and represent an important target group for efforts aimed at reducing unnecessary
antibiotic use.
Objective.--To evaluate antibiotic-prescribing practices for children younger
than 18 years who had received a diagnosis of cold, upper respiratory tract infec-
tion (URI), or bronchitis in the United States.
Design.--Representative national survey of practicing physicians participating
in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey conducted in 1992 with a response
rate of 73%.
Setting.--Office-based physician practices.
Participants.--Physicians completing patient record forms for patients younger
than 18 years.
Main Outcome Measures.--Principal diagnoses and antibiotic prescriptions.
Results.--A total of 531 pediatric office visits were recorded that included a
principal diagnosis of cold, URI, or bronchitis. Antibiotics were prescribed to 44%
of patients with common colds, 46% with URIs, and 75% with bronchitis. Extrapo-
lating to the United States, 6.5 million prescriptions (12% of all prescriptions for
children) were written for children diagnosed as having a URI or nasopharyngitis
(common cold), and 4.7 million (9% of all prescriptions for children) were written for
children diagnosed as having bronchitis. After controlling for confounding factors,
antibiotics were prescribed more often for children aged 5 to 11 years than for
younger children (odds ratio [OR], 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-3.33)
and rates were lower for pediatricians than for nonpediatricians (OR, 0.57; 95% CI,
0.35-0.92). Children aged 0 to 4 years received 53% of all antibiotic prescriptions,
and otitis media was the most frequent diagnosis for which antibiotics were
prescribed (30% of all prescriptions).
Conclusions.--Antibiotic prescribing for children diagnosed as having colds,
URIs, and bronchitis, conditions that typically do not benefit from antibiotics, rep-
resents a substantial proportion of total antibiotic prescriptions to children in the
United States each year.

INCREASING rates of antibiotic resis-
tance in community pathogens have fo-
cused the attention of researchers and
clinicians on this public health problem.1
Priorto1980,morethan99%ofallStrep-
tococcus pneumoniae cases were sus-
ceptible to penicillin. In the past decade,
however, up to 40% of clinical isolates
have demonstrated intermediate- and
high-level resistance to penicillins and
cephalosporins in children.2-6
Pediatric populations are important
targets for efforts aimed at reducing un-
necessary antibiotic use. Environments
unique to children, such as day care and
school, enhance the transmission and
spreadofdrug-resistantSpneumoniae.2,3
The frequency and duration of prior anti-
biotic exposure are strongly associated
with the spread of drug-resistant S pneu-
moniae,andchildrenreceiveasignificant
proportion of the total antibiotics pre-
scribed each year.4-7
For editorial comment see p 881.
Reducingunnecessaryantibioticusein
children requires identification of condi-
tions for which antibiotics are overpre-
scribed. McCaig and Hughes7 reported
that upper respiratory tract infections
(URIs)andbronchitisrankedsecondand
thirdamongconditionsassociatedwithan-
tibiotic prescriptions by US ambulatory
physiciansin1992.Furthercharacteriza-
tion of this antibiotic-prescribing prac-
ticeinpediatricpopulationsisneeded.The
goalsofthisstudyweretoidentifythecon-
ditions for which clinicians prescribe an-
tibiotics most frequently in children and
to characterize the antibiotic-prescrib-
ing practices for conditions that do not
typically benefit from antibiotics (colds,
URIs, and bronchitis).8-10
Methods
The National Ambulatory Medical
CareSurvey(NAMCS),conductedannu-
ally by the National Center for Health
Statistics, provides national estimates of
reasonspeopleseekmedicalattentionand
the diagnoses and prescriptions they re-
ceive from a representative sample of US
ambulatorycarephysicians.11 Ananalysis
of antibiotic prescribing for adults has
been previously reported by our group.12
For the current study, we evaluated
antibiotic prescriptions from the 1992
survey for patients younger than 18
years with the principal diagnoses of
acutenasopharyngitis(commoncold,In-
ternational Classification of Diseases,

Results
Theleadingambulatorycarediagnoses
accounting for antibiotic prescriptions in
children younger than 18 years are pre-
sented in Table 1. Otitis media was the
leading condition, accounting for 30% of
the total antibiotic prescriptions to chil-
dren in ambulatory practice in 1992. Di-
agnoses of URI (including the common
cold), pharyngitis, and bronchitis ac-
counted for 12%, 10%, and 9% of total
antibiotic prescriptions, respectively.
Antibiotics were prescribed in 44% of
cases diagnosed as the common cold, 46%
ofURIs,72%ofacutebronchitis,and76%
of bronchitis, not otherwise specified (to-
tal for bronchitis overall, 75%). Antibiotic
prescription rates were significantly
lowerforURIsthanforbronchitis(2 test,
P.001) (Figure).
Antibiotic prescription rates for colds,
URIs, and bronchitis, as a group, were
stratified by patient-specific factors (age
group, gender, race, ethnicity), practice
demographics (geographic region, US
Censusstandardizedmetropolitanstatis-
tical area), method of payment, and phy-
sician specialty (Table 2). Factors signifi-
cantly associated with greater antibiotic
prescription rates in the bivariate analy-
ses (unadjusted ORs) included patients
aged5to11years(OR,2.24;95%CI,1.34-
3.73)andpatientsaged12to17years(OR,
2.17;95%CI,1.15-4.08).Pediatricianshad
lower antibiotic prescription rates (OR,
0.51;95%CI,0.33-0.77)thanphysiciansin
other specialties.
After controlling for variations due to
gender, race, payment source, physician
specialty, and practice location, signifi-
cant independent associations persisted
for children aged 5 to 11 years (compared
withthoseaged0to4years)andpediatri-
cians (compared with nonpediatricians).
Children aged 5 to 11 years were 1.94
timesaslikelytoreceiveanantibioticpre-
scription at an office visit related to colds,
URIs,andbronchitisaschildrenaged0to
4years.Pediatricianswere0.57timesless
likely to prescribe antibiotics for these
conditions than nonpediatricians. These
associations persisted within disease cat-
egories and were not affected by exclud-
ing office visits for which secondary diag-
noses of otitis media, sinusitis, and phar-
yngitis were reported (present in 12% of
the study sample) (data not shown).
Table 2 also displays the percentage of
total antibiotic use in each group. Despite
a lower antibiotic prescription rate, chil-
dren aged 0 to 4 years received 53% of all
antibioticprescriptionstopediatricpopu-
lations. Pediatricians, while prescribing
less frequently than nonpediatricians, ac-
counted for approximately half of all pre-
scriptions.
Comment
Colds, URIs, and bronchitis accounted
forover20%ofallantibioticprescriptions
providedbyUSambulatoryphysiciansto
children (18 years) in 1992, despite the
lack of evidence that antibiotics improve
outcomesinthesepatients.8-10 Ourfinding
that antibiotics were prescribed for the
commoncoldin44%ofvisitsandforURIs
in46%ofvisitscorroboratesothersmaller
studiesofantibiotic-prescribingpractices
in children.14,15
Controlling for all other factors, we
found that patient age (age 5 to 11 years)
and physician specialty were indepen-
dentpredictorsofantibioticuseforthese
respiratory illnesses. There was also
suggestive evidence that antibiotic pre-
scribing was more common in visits for
children aged 12 to 17 years and by phy-
sicians practicing in the South (90% CIs
excluded 1.0).
Physicians who provide care for chil-
drenandarenottrainedaspediatricians
weremorelikelytoprescribeantibiotics
for colds, URIs, and bronchitis than pe-
diatricians. This finding could be due to
differential distribution among physi-
cian specialties of a number of factors
that have been reported to influence the
treatment of children with acute respi-
ratoryillnesses,includingparentalpres-
sure,patientvolume,andthephysician's
desire to act or to validate the office
visit.16-20 For example, parents whose
children are seen by pediatricians may
have different expectations regarding
antibiotic prescribing. It is also possible
that pediatricians use different clinical
criteria for deciding when to prescribe

anantibioticforchildrenwithURIs.For
example, they may place less weight on
the purulence of secretions than nonpe-
diatricians, a factor that seems to in-
crease the likelihood for antibiotic treat-
ment of URIs.21
Office visits for school-aged children
were more likely to result in an antibi-
otic prescription than visits for younger
children (although younger children,
aged 0 to 4 years, still account for 53% of
the total antibiotic burden in pediatric
populations). This finding could also re-
flect differences in parental pressure.
Since parents of school-aged children
often do not have mechanisms in place
to care for their child at home, they
may perceive antibiotic treatment as
reassurancethat"everythingpossibleis
being done" and feel more comfortable
returning the child with a respiratory
illness back to school.
TheNAMCSprovidesimportantinfor-
mation about antibiotic-prescribing prac-
tices in the United States because of its
representativeness, standardized data
collection methods, and the ability to
avoidascertainmentbiasrelatedtostudy
hypotheses. Despite this, our study was
limited because physicians may have re-
ported diagnoses in a biased manner to
justify antibiotic treatment. However,
thisoccurrencewouldlikelyleadtoanun-
derestimationofantibioticprescribingfor
colds, URIs, and bronchitis. To decrease
the potential for misclassification, we in-
cludedonlythoseofficevisitsinthestudy
in which cold, URI, or bronchitis were
listedastheprincipaldiagnosisandanan-
tibiotic was listed as the principal drug
therapy.
Antibiotics are frequently prescribed
for children with colds, URIs, and bron-
chitis, despite recommendations to the
contrary. This study confirms that the
overuse of antibiotics for these condi-
tions is widespread, prevalent in all
medicalspecialties,andnotdramatically
influenced by patient demographics or
methods of payment. Understanding
why physicians prescribe antibiotics for
conditions not helped by antibiotics will
require broadly based studies of physi-
cian decision making and patient health-
seekingbehavior.Effortstoimprovean-
tibiotic-prescribingpracticesshouldtar-
get all physicians and parents who care
for children and teenagers.

product to growers since that time. It was only in 1997 that
Glaxo Wellcome filed trademark papers to use the name "Zy-
ban" for smoking cessation pharmaceuticals.
Second, the labeling for Zyban WSB states clear warnings,
in both Spanish and English, that include, among other warn-
ing language and precautionary statements, that it is for pro-
fessional use only, and is harmful if swallowed or inhaled.
Third, this product is not available to the consumer through
retail channels, but rather is sold only through professional
distributors who sell to the horticulture industry. Also, the
product's packaging does not lend itself to consumer use, as
the product is packaged in a durable plastic pouch, with four
8-oz water-soluble bags enclosed, filled with wettable powder,
and instructions for horticultural application.
Last, we disagree with Dr Bubb's assertion that agricul-
tural workers would be familiar with classification names of
chemical compounds such as benzimidazoles, and would be
likely to formulate a mental connection between a veterinary
product and a fungicide for use on ornamental plant material.

Macular Edema Associated With Nicotinic Acid (Niacin)
To the Editor.--Oral nicotinic acid (niacin) lowers serum cho-
lesterol levels when taken in high doses.1 Although nicotinic
acid has not achieved widespread use, its low cost makes it
attractive in today's cost-conscious medical environment and
itsusemaybeincreasing.Inthisreport,wedescribe3patients
who developed visual loss while taking nicotinic acid for hy-
percholesterolemia.
ReportofCases.--A51-year-oldmangraduallyincreasedhis
dose of nicotinic acid from 1 g to 4.5 g. Within 4 weeks, he noted
blurred vision in both eyes. Visual acuity was 20/60 OD and
20/70OS.Bothfoveahadacysticappearancebutnoleakagewas
demonstrated on fluorescein angiography. The patient discon-
tinued the nicotinic acid and reported significant improvement
1 month later, with measured visual acuity of 20/25.
A 53-year-old man increased his dose of oral nicotinic acid
from l g/d to 3 g/d over 1 year. He had been taking 3 g/d for 6
monthswhenhenotedgradualonsetofdarkeningofthevision
("someone turned down the rheostat"). Visual acuity was
20/60 OD and 20/50 OS and there was typical cystoid macular
edema without leakage on angiography. Use of the nicotinic
acid was discontinued and within 3 days the patient noted
improvement. Visual acuity 1 month later was 20/20 OU.
A 51-year-old male physician began taking 2 g of nicotinic
acid twice daily to lower his cholesterol. Eighteen months
later he noted mild metamorphopsia bilaterally ("like heat
comingoffaradiator").Visualacuitywas20/20(corrected)OD
and 20/25 OS. The fovea had a cystic pattern (Figure, A) and
no leakage on angiogram (Figure, B). He discontinued use of
thenicotinicacidandwithin2monthsthevisualsymptomshad
resolved;visualacuitywas20/20ODand20/15OS.Themacula
demonstrated normal appearance with resolution of the cys-
toid macular edema in both eyes (Figure, C).
Comment.--Nicotinic acid maculopathy is an uncommon oc-
currence and, therefore, not widely appreciated. Gass2 first re-
ported loss of vision associated with high doses of nicotinic acid
for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.1 To our knowledge,
there is only 1 other report of confirmed nicotinic acid macu-
lopathy in the literature.3 The usual symptom is blurring of
vision and the time to development of symptoms varies. The
clinical findings include cystoid macular edema on biomicros-
copy and absence of leakage on fluorescein angiogram. Fortu-
nately, the adverse effect appears reversible with lowering the
dose or discontinuing the use of nicotinic acid. Clinicians should
be aware of this potential complication in patients who take
nicotinic acid.
