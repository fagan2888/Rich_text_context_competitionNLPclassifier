Introduction
Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a global public health
problem gaining attention worldwide due to the numerous
known negative consequences including injury (Sheridan &
Nash, 2007), alcohol and substance abuse (Campbell, 2002;
Ellsberg, Jansen, Heise, Watts, & Garcia-Moreno, 2008),
negative reproductive health outcomes (Okenwa, Lawoko, &
Jansson, 2009, 2011), and mental health problems (Aidoo &
Harpham, 2001; Ali, Mogren, & Krantz 2013). Research
findings suggest that IPV against women may be more prev-
alent in low-income and more gender-stratified settings
(Beauchamp, Lindsay, Hunter, & Talavera, 2012; Oyediran
& Isiugo-Abanihe, 2005; Sabarwal, Santhya, & Jejeebhoy,
2014). Recent World Health Organization (WHO) estimates
show that while the prevalence of physical IPV (such as wife
beating) and sexual IPV in high-income countries is up to
23.2%, prevalence from low- and middle-income countries
among ever-partnered women lie from 24.6% in the Western
pacific region to as much as 36.6% in the African region
(WHO, 2013).
There are many individual-level risk factors associated
with IPV victimization, for example, being of a young age,
low or no education, financial dependence on a partner,
unemployment, and alcohol use (Jewkes, 2002; Uthman,
Lawoko, & Moradi, 2009). One risk factor that is currently
gaining more focus in research is attitude toward IPV.
Substantial evidence suggesting associations between IPV
justification and exposure (Abramsky et al., 2011) imply a
need for understanding attitudes in especially middle and
low-income countries. Again, research coming from Africa
shows that men and women may vary in their attitude to IPV
(Rani, Bonu, & Diop-Sidibe, 2004; Uthman et al., 2009).
A number of theories have been put forward to explain
the existence of tolerant attitudes. One of them is the nor-
malization theory which is a feministic theory that describes
the continuous shifting of boundaries until acts of violence
gradually take on a new meaning (Lundgren, 1993;
Lundgren, Heimer, Westerstrand, & Kalliokoski, 2001).
The woman primarily sees the man's violence as an inter-
pretation of her own failure. Normalization includes all
kinds of assumptions that portray male violence within inti-
mate relationships as normal. Examples of assumption are
those arising from the practice of patriarchy and the

Attitudes Toward Physical Intimate
Partner Violence Against Women in
Nigeria
Leah Okenwa-Emegwa1, Stephen Lawoko2 and Bjarne Jansson3
Abstract
Attitudes toward intimate partner violence (IPV) are known predictors of IPV victimization and perpetration with more
women generally believed to justify IPV than men. An understanding of the determinants of justification of IPV may provide
information necessary for holistic interventions. This study sought to examine the magnitude, extent, and predictors of
justification of physical IPV against women among men and women in Nigeria. Data from 33,385 women and 15,486 men
from the 2008 Nigerian demographic and health surveys were analyzed using chi-square test and multiple logistic regressions.
Results show that although larger proportions of women justified physical IPV, certain categories of men such as poor,
illiterate men, and men with secondary education justified abuse more than women. Contrary to expectations, access
to radio/TV increased the odds of justifying abuse among women thus casting doubts on program content. The gender
differences observed for predictors of attitudes to physical IPV suggest a need for gender-tailored interventions to change
attitudes toward partner violence in Nigeria.

misconception that violence is a normal part of a romantic
relationship. Normalization theory provides a framework
for understanding the misconceptions that violence is a
marginal problem practiced under special circumstances
(such as alcohol influence), directed at certain types of
woman and practiced by certain categories of men
(Lundgren, 1993).
Unlike the normalization theory, the social learning the-
ory suggests that individuals learn and adopt behaviors
which they have observed among their role models
(Bandura, 1963; Bandura & Park, 1972). According to this
theory, learning is a cognitive process occurring within a
social context through observation or direct instruction.
The extent and magnitude of what is learned is reinforced
by rewards (of socially acceptable behaviors) or punish-
ment (of socially unacceptable behaviors) during the learn-
ing process. Social norms and gender roles in a patriarchal
society, for instance, are learned within social groups and
transmitted from generation to generation. The social con-
struction of gender which gives rise to specific defined
ideas about what women and men are and what roles they
play in a society is in many ways reinforced by the social
learning theory. Gender is thus an achieved status, con-
structed through psychological, cultural, and social means
(West & Zimmerman, 1987).
Although some studies in Sub-Saharan Africa have
attempted to understand factors associated with justification
of wife beating among women (Husnu & Mertan, 2015;
Uthman et al., 2009), factors associated with such justifica-
tion among men have not received equivocal attention in
research. There are two main rationales for this study, first is
that comparing the risk factors for IPV justification between
men and women may prove vital in designing intervention
that focus on attitudinal change for both the perpetrators and
victims of wife abuse. Second is that although IPV is justi-
fied by both men and women, there appears to be a general
claim that more women than men justify IPV and other
harmful gender-based harmful practices against women
(Ilika & Ilika, 2005; Rani et al., 2004). Not much, however,
is known about differences n attitudes between men and
women in Nigeria.
The main aim of this study, therefore, is to examine the
magnitude and extent of justification of physical IPV against
women and its predictors among women and men in Nigeria.
A second objective is to study the relationship between expo-
sure to IPV and attitudes to wife beating among women.
Method
Study Design
This study is based on the Nigerian Demographic and Health
Survey (NDHS) of 2008. The DHS is a U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID)-funded survey carried
out in many developing countries. These surveys are done on
a 5-yearly basis with the purpose of monitoring demographic
and health situation of the countries. The sampling method is
done such that data collected is nationally representative.
Ethical approval for the instruments and survey procedure is
granted by the Institutional review board of the opinion
research corporation Macro International. The 2008 Nigerian
DHS was conducted in conjunction with the Nigerian National
Population Commission (NPC [Nigeria] & ICF Macro, 2009).
Sampling Design
The NDHS covers a nationally representative sample of
36,298 households based on an estimate relying on the 2006
Population and Housing Census of the Federal Republic of
Nigeria. Administratively, Nigeria is divided into states.
Each state is subdivided into local government areas (LGAs),
and each LGA is divided into localities. In addition to these
administrative units, each locality was subdivided into con-
venient areas called census enumeration areas (EAs) during
the 2006 Population Census. The primary sampling unit
(PSU), referred to as a cluster for the 2008 NDHS, is defined
on the basis of EAs from the 2006 EA census frame. The
2008 NDHS sample was selected using a stratified two-stage
cluster design consisting of 888 clusters, 286 in the urban
and 602 in the rural areas. Of the representative sample of
36,298 households selected for the 2008 NDHS survey,
about 34,644 were occupied. A response rate of 98% was
obtained, that is, 30,070 household were successfully inter-
viewed. There was no difference in response rate between
rural and urban participants.
Using equal probability sampling, an average of 41 house-
holds were selected in each cluster during Stage 2. All
women aged between 15 and 49 years, resident or visiting
the selected households on the night before the survey, were
eligible to be interviewed. All men aged 15 to 59 years, resi-
dents visiting a subset of half of the selected households on
the night before the survey, were eligible to be interviewed.
For questions on domestic violence, a subsample of one eli-
gible woman in each household was randomly selected to
respond to questions on exposure to IPV. The questionnaire
was administered in strict compliance of the WHO ethical
and safety recommendation for research on domestic vio-
lence (WHO, 2001).
Participants
A total of 33,385 women of the 34,596 eligible women
responded (response rate 96.5%). The domestic violence
module was administered on a subsample made up of one
randomly selected eligible woman in each household. This
way, a subsample of 21,468 women responded to the domes-
tic violence module (used here to explore the second part of
the study objective). In a subsample of half of the house-
holds, 15,486 of the 16,722 eligible men were successfully
interviewed giving rise to a response rate of 92.6%.

Questionnaire
A comprehensive questionnaire covering demographic and
health issues was administered to eligible men and women.
The aspects covered include women's background, repro-
ductive health, access to reproductive health facilities, fertil-
ity preferences, child care and nutrition, child mortality,
awareness of and precaution against sexually transmitted
diseases, marriage and sexual behavior, gender roles,
empowerment factors (e.g., autonomy in the household and
access to information), and IPV. For this study, the questions
on attitudes to wife beating, domestic violence empower-
ment factors, and sociodemographic factors were of primary
interest. However, questions on exposure to partner violence
were administered to only women.
Measures
Dependent variable
Attitudes to physical IPV.
This was assessed using
responses to five hypothetical situations. These questions are
commonly used in Africa in this field of research (Kenyan
DHS, 2003; Nigerian DHS, 2003, Zambian DHS, 2003), and
probe whether physical IPV (defined in this study as wife
beating) is okay in the following scenarios: if the wife goes
out without informing husband, neglects the children, argues
with her partner, refuses to have sex with partner, or cooks
bad food/or food is served late. Answer options were yes, no,
or don't know). An affirmative response to one or several
of these questions was considered having a tolerant attitude
toward wife beating, while a "no" response on all five situ-
ations denoted a non-tolerant attitude. This categorization is
in line with recent discussion of achieving "zero-tolerance"
of violence against women.
Independent variables
Sociodemographic variables. These included the following:
age 15 to 49, for both women and men; literacy (1 = can read
little or nothing, 2 = can read whole sentences); religion
(1 = Catholic, 2 = other Christian, 3 = Muslim, 4 = Tradi-
tional, 5 = Other); ethnicity (1 = Hausa/Fulani, 2 = Yoruba,
3 = Ibo, 4 = Others); wealth index (1 = poorest, 2 = poor
class, 3 = least poor); region (1 = north central, 2 = north-
east, 3 = northwest, 4 = southeast, 5 = southwest, 6 = south),
and place of residence (1 = urban, 2 = rural).
Wealth index.Constructed from the household's owner-
ship of goods and facilities (coded as 1 = poorest, 2 = poor,
3 = least poor), is used as a proxy for economic status. Asset
information was collected in the 2008 NDHS on household
ownership of a number of consumer items, such as televi-
sion, bicycle, or car. Information about dwelling character-
istics such as source of drinking water, type of sanitation
facilities, and type of material used in flooring were col-
lected. Each household was assigned a score from each asset,
and the scores were summed for each household; individuals
were ranked according to the total score of the household
in which they resided. The sample was then divided into
quintiles, from one to five. The level of wealth index ranges
from the first to the fifth quintile, corresponding to the least
and most well-off, respectively. For this study, the first two
quartiles were merged to form one group, poorest, the middle
quartile formed the group "poor" while the last 2 quartiles
were merged to form one group, least poor.
Empowerment indicators.These included the following:
access to information, assessed by a woman's frequency
of reading newspapers, listening to radio, or watching TV;
response (coded as 1 = not at all, 2 = less than once a week,
3 = at least once a week, 4 = almost every day). Decision
autonomy, assessed by asking respondents who in the house-
hold had the final say on household expenditures, health
care, and household purchase with the following response
options (coded as 1 = woman only/woman and her husband,
2 = husband or husband and someone else).
Exposure to IPV. One of the independent variables used in the
women's analysis, was assessed using a modified version of
the Conflict Tactic Scale (CTS; Straus & Gelles, 1990),
which assesses whether participants have, since the age of 15
years and during the past 12 months, experienced abuse per-
petrated by the current husband/partner. Experience of IPV
in the past 12 months was of primary interest for this study.
Exposure to Physical IPV in the past year was operational-
ized as being slapped, kicked, bitten, pushed, punched,
choked, burnt on purpose, or assaulted using a knife or other
weapons during the past year (coded as 1 = no, 2 = yes).
Exposure to Sexual IPV in the past year was operationalized
as having been physically forced to have sexual intercourse
when she did not want to; degrading or humiliating sexual
acts, or engaging in sexual intercourse out of fear in the past
year (coded as 1 = no, 2 = yes). Exposure to Psychological
IPV in the past year was operationalized as having been
exposed to verbal abuse, insults, made to feel bad about one-
self, belittled in front of other people, scared or intimidated,
threatened with violence or threats to harm loved ones, and
so on in the past year (coded as 1 = no, 2 = yes).
Statistical Analyses
Data impute and analysis was done using the SPSS program
Version 15.0. Missing data were relatively low and were thus
analyzed simply as missing. The foregoing implies that no
measures such as substituting missing data with the national or
sample average were taken in the analysis. No measures were
taken to, for example, substitute with the national/sample aver-
age, common practices when data sets are relatively small. Chi-
square test was used to assess for crude associations between
dependent and independent variables. The independent contri-
bution of the explanatory variable in explaining attitudes
4 SAGE Open
toward wife beating was assessed using multiple logistic
regression as a measure to control for potential confounders.
Direction and magnitude of associations were expressed as
adjusted odds ratio (OR), and the contribution of each set of
variables (i.e., sociodemographic, empowerment indicators
and IPV exposure) was expressed in terms of R2. The signifi-
cance level was set at p < .05 for all statistical analysis.
Results
As shown in Table 1, significantly more women than men
would justify physical IPV in all the scenarios indicated.
Similarly, more women than men justified abuse for at least
one of the stated reason. For both men and women, two sce-
narios most likely to lead to justification of physical IPV
were if the wife went out without telling her husband and if
she neglected the children.
Proportions of Women Justifying Physical IPV by
Sociodemographic Factors, Access to Information,
Autonomy and Exposure to IPV
As indicated in Table 2, proportions of women and men
endorsing physical IPV varied according to demographic
factors, access to information and autonomy indicators.
Endorsement of physical IPV increased with increasing age
among men and women. For both women and men, higher
numbers endorsed physical IPV among the illiterate, low-
educated, rural residents and those of traditional religions.
Among women, the endorsement physical IPV was most
prevalent in the Hausa/Fulani ethnic group and women liv-
ing in the North Western region. Physical IPV justification
among men was most prevalent in the Ibo/other ethnic groups
and men residing in the North eastern region. Men and
women living in households where women lacked autonomy
in domestic decisions were more likely to endorse wife beat-
ing and physical IPV. Among both men and women, the pro-
portion endorsing IPV reduced with increasing wealth and
access to information. Finally, women exposed to IPV more
often than un-exposed peers endorsed physical IPV.
Factors Associated With Attitudes Toward Wife
Beating: Adjusted Estimates
Block 1: Social demographic indicators. From Table 3, it can
be seen that after controlling for other variables within the
model, an inverse relationship was observed for the age
variable, that is, increasing levels of justification with
decreasing age for both males and females. The likelihood
of endorsing wife abuse tended to decrease with increasing
age quite opposite to what was observed in Table 1. Justifi-
cation of wife beating also reduced with increasing levels
of education for both men and women. Urban settlement
and belonging to the rich quintile reduced the likelihood of
endorsing wife abuse among both men and women. Belong-
ing to ethnic Yoruba or Igbo groups reduced the likelihood
of justifying wife abuse when compared with other ethnic
groups. Contrasting with peers from the south western
region, men and women from the north eastern, south east-
ern, and south regions exhibited a higher likelihood of jus-
tifying abuse. Religion did not affect significantly the
likelihood of justifying abuse among both women and men.
Sociodemographic indicators accounted for 9% and10% of
the variation in justification of IPV among women and
men, respectively.
Block 2: Access to information and autonomy in decision
making.Although increasing access to information via news-
papers/magazines increased the likelihood of justifying
physical IPV among men, justification of abuse tended to
increase with frequent access to such media among women.
Listening to radio, however, was associated with an increased
likelihood of justifying abuse among women but with a
reduced likelihood among men. Men and women living in
households where husband had full autonomy in household
decisions reported a higher likelihood of justifying abuse
than peers living in household with shared autonomy or
household with women having full autonomy. Access to
information and autonomy indicators accounted for about
10% and 12% of the variation in justification of IPV among
women and men, respectively.

Discussion
The current study examined the magnitude, extent, and
determinants of justification of physical IPV against women
among males and females in Nigeria. After controlling for
other sociodemographic and economic characteristics,
results show overall justification of abuse higher among
women than among men. This observation is consistent with
data from other Sub-Saharan and other context (Rani et al.,
2004; Uthman et al., 2009; WHO, 2005). However, findings
from this study also show that whereas more women than
men will justify abuse for at least one hypothetical scenario,
there are strong indications that more men than women jus-
tify abuse in certain circumstances. Although the reasons for
the above observations are not exactly clear, the social learn-
ing theory provides a framework within which the observa-
tions can be explained. For example, justification of abuse
observed in this study was significantly higher in younger
age groups among men and women but higher among men in
age groups 15 to 19 and 20 to 29 (OR = 1.430 and 1.456,
respectively) than women of same age groups (OR = 1.370
and 1.278, respectively). The explanation may lie in the
social learning theory, i.e. young people learn and accept the
physical abuse of women as punishment for bad behavior.
Similar findings among younger have been found in other
studies (e.g., Abramsky et al., 2011).
Considering that there is contradictory trend of less justifi-
cation with increasing age seen in this study, the high rates of
justification of abuse among younger people may indeed be a
clear indication of an effective system of transfer of traditional
values to younger generation simply to keep in line with tradi-
tion and not because the older custodians truly believe in what
they are handing down. Low levels of justification of abuse
were also observed among men and women in urban settings
compared with rural settings. This is in line with findings by
others (Faramarzi, Esmailzadeh, & Mosavi 2005; WHO,
2005; Yount & Li, 2009) but in contrast to comparably equal
levels of justification of abuse in urban and rural settings
observed by Rani et al. (2004). Studies have, however, shown
that having a rural upbringing is as much an important deter-
minant as living in rural settings.
Haj-Yahia (2000) argues that many victims of IPV are
conditioned to justify abuse to secure sustenance for them-
selves and their children. Findings from the present study
regarding economy is in line may be explained in part by this
argument. The reward and punishment system is again seen
here because there is evidence that women without strong
means of livelihood fare poorly when they challenge norms
of male dominancy by leaving the violent partner (Haj-
Yahia, 2000). This is also explainable by the normalization
theory with the women interpreting partner's violence as an
indication of her failure and learns to consider it as normal.
Although the social learning theory explains learning by
observation, Rani et al. (2004) explain that as women gain
education, employment, and thereby financial freedom, the
myth of male superiority becomes directly or indirectly chal-
lenged resulting in a conflict between reality and myth.
Female participants in this study with secondary or higher
education, with better wealth index, and who had certain
autonomy in decision making were least likely to justify
physical IPV.Among the men, however, justification of abuse
among men increased with increasing education up to sec-
ondary level. The odds for justification of abuse were com-
paratively higher among men than women in categories such
as men with secondary education, illiterate, and those with
poorer wealth index. This corroborates previous findings
showing a social gradient in attitudes toward wife beating
(Lawoko, 2008). Because the aforementioned factors are
well-known indicators of socioeconomic status (SES), a lot
can be deduced from this finding. For example, Men are more
likely to resort to intimate partner violence when their tradi-
tional status of economic and social superiority is threatened

(Atkinson, Greenstein, & Lang 2005). The justification of
physical IPV seen in these groups of men must be addressed
rather than resting on the general assumption that women jus-
tify abuse more than men. Ethnic Yoruba and Igbo partici-
pants had a lower likelihood of endorsing wife abuse
supporting the notion that some ethnic groups may be less
gender restrictive than others.
The association between indicators of access to informa-
tion and endorsement of wife abuse were in some cases con-
tradictory. In the case of newspaper reading, the finding is in
the expected direction, that is, women who do not read news-
papers are more likely to justify abuse. On the contrary, with
increasing frequency of listening to radio and watching tele-
vision, there was an increased tendency to justify wife beat-
ing among women, but a reduced tendency among men.
Given the above findings, the role of mass media as a means
of information and empowerment against violence against
women becomes questionable. The Nigeria film is acclaimed
as the largest in Africa, it was reported by the UN news cen-
ter as having surpassed Hollywood and Bollywood in terms
of productivity as at 2009 (United Nations, 2009). However,
some researchers and activists in the field of violence against
women have raised concerns regarding the content of Nigeria
films and television dramas (Adewoye, Odesanya,Abubakar,
& Jimoh, 2014; Ojukwu & Ezenandu, 2012). Many of these
emphasize traditional beliefs and gender stereotyping,
thereby reinforcing existing gender inequalities. These pro-
grams are often packaged in a manner intended for women to
learn lessons about the consequences of non-conformity
with women themselves championing these opinions. For
example, Adewoye et al., in a 2014 analysis of Nigerian
movie content, found that educated, successful career women
were often depicted as insubordinate to their husbands and
uncaring of their children.
The lower likelihood of men who watch TV less than
once a week to justify physical IPV against women com-
pared with those who watch almost every day further cast
questions on program content. On the contrary, the tendency
for men who listen to radio more frequently to be less sup-
portive of wife beating may be suggestive of other factors.
For example, considering that this is contrary to the findings
among women, it may be that men and women differ in their
choice of radio programs. This may have implications for
research and practice. In research, for example, it may no
longer be enough to ask only about access to information,
asking about program preference may provide useful infor-
mation. For practice, it can no longer be assumed that
improved access to information will contribute in changing
attitudes to IPV. The need for improving program content
through collaborating with stakeholders (e.g., film makers
and sponsors) may prove important for evidence base
interventions.
The current study also assessed the association between
exposure to IPV and attitudes toward physical IPV defined
here as wife beating. Women experiencing physical and sex-
ual abuse exhibited a higher likelihood of endorsing abuse,
supporting the social learning theory discussed previously.
Another plausible explanation could stem from the fact that
repeated abuse may diminish a woman's self-esteem and
thereby increase her propensity to blame herself for whatever

reason is triggering the abuse (e.g., burning the food). At that
point, the foundation has been set to justify any action to
"punish" transgression from her normative roles. The psy-
chosocial impact of conditioned abuse and how this may
impact on attitudes toward abuse deserves attention in the
research.
In conclusion, findings from this study show that Nigeria
does not differ from most other low country setting where
more proportions of women than men have been found to
justify abuse. However, more men than women justify physi-
cal IPV when specific factors, for example, wealth index and
educational level are examined. Attitudes toward physical
IPV varied across different sociodemographic factors, access
to information and autonomy in decision making as well as
exposure to IPV. These findings may prove useful in design-
ing interventions to confront IPV with focus on groups at
risk. Another potential contribution of the findings from this
study is the likelihood to start discussions regarding the con-
tribution of Nigerian media programs in propagating female
submission and male dominance.
Strengths and Limitations
The strength of this study lies in its large, nationally repre-
sentative data sets based on good sampling procedures.
These have been gathered in strict adherence to ethical
standards for domestic violence research ensuring women's
safety (WHO, 2001). One limitation is that the analysis of
secondary data generally places a limitation to the extent to
which factors can be explored. For example, measure of
attitudes to IPV captures only women's normative roles in
the domestic arena. Other plausible motivating factors for
IPV such as women's participation in income generating
activity, education, husband's drunkenness, to mention but
a few, are not incorporated in the measurement of attitudes
to IPV. Broader measures including the above-mentioned
variables are necessary as they have been previously proven
to play roles in explaining IPV (Hoffman, Demo, &
Edwards, 1994; Krishnan, 2005; Malcoe, Duran, &
Montgomery, 2004). Another limitation comes from face-
to-face interviews. Participants may tend to underreport atti-
tudes when contrasted with responses from self-administered
questionnaires. This, however, may have been improved by
the use of trained personal and the guarantee of anonymity
which are part of ethical issues surrounding research in this
field.
