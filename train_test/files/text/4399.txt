Self-Resemblance and Social Rejection

Abstract
Humans perceive and treat self-resembling others in ways that suggest that self-resemblance is a cue of kinship. However, we
know little about how individuals respond to treatment by self-resembling others. Here we approach this problem by connecting
facial self-resemblance to social rejection. Given that individuals should expect to cooperate with kin, we hypothesized that
(1) social inclusion by perceived kin should elicit lesser feelings of rejection and (2) social exclusion by perceived kin should elicit
greater feelings of rejection relative to inclusion or exclusion, respectively, by nonkin. To test these hypotheses, we recruited
90 participants to play two games of Cyberball, a virtual ball-tossing game, with separate pairs of ostensible partners. In one game,
the ostensible partners were programed to fully include the participants in group play and, in the other game, they were pro-
gramed to exclude the participants after a few rounds; the order of inclusion and exclusion was counterbalanced across parti-
cipants. Partner faces were digitally manipulated to be either self- or nonself-resembling, and these conditions were also
counterbalanced. Rejection feelings differed significantly as a function of self-resemblance between the inclusion and exclusion
conditions, but only for participants who experienced inclusion first. Moreover, for these individuals, inclusion by self-resembling
partners led to significantly lesser feelings of rejection than did inclusion by nonself-resembling partners. To explain this effect, we
explore potential mechanisms of kin recognition and social rejection. Although nuanced, our results suggest that perceptions of
kinship can moderate psychological responses to the actions of others.

Inclusive fitness theory (Hamilton, 1964) provides two broad
ways in which actors can improve their genetic posterity.
They can do so directly, by increasing their own ability to
survive and reproduce (direct fitness), or indirectly, by help-
ing genetic relatives--such as genealogical kin, who are more
likely than chance to bear copies of the actor's alleles iden-
tical by descent--to survive and reproduce (indirect fitness).
To allocate indirect fitness benefits appropriately, many spe-
cies have evolved mechanisms of kin recognition to determine
genetic relatedness (Hepper, 1991; Krupp, DeBruine, &
Jones, 2011; Waldman, 1987). Humans, for instance, have
historically lived in communities consisting of a mixture of
related and unrelated individuals with whom they would have
exchanged goods and services. This situation would have
encouraged the evolution of a range of kin recognition
mechanisms (Cornwallis, West, & Griffin, 2009; Krupp,
DeBruine, & Barclay, 2008), including those using contextual
(e.g., Lieberman, 2009; Lieberman, Tooby, & Cosmides,
2007) and phenotypic cues (e.g., DeBruine, 2002; Krupp
et al., 2008), to allocate resources discriminatively.
Kinship and Self-Resemblance
Among these mechanisms, humans appear to recognize kin in
part by phenotype matching, a process by which an individual
evaluator compares the phenotypes of social partners to infor-
mation about his or her own phenotype and to the distribution
of phenotypes in the larger population (Krupp et al., 2011;
Krupp & Taylor, 2013). This information may develop as a

consequence of genetic inheritance, learning, or both, and it
also may be updated continuously throughout the life span. For
instance, information about one's own phenotype can be
learned through direct experience (i.e., self-inspection) or
through experience with the phenotypes of caregivers and nest-
mates who are typically parents and siblings. Partners whose
phenotypes are relatively similar to the evaluator's own
expected phenotype are classified as kin (or ``positive'' rela-
tives), and partners whose phenotypes are relatively dissimilar
are classified as nonkin (or possibly even as ``negative'' rela-
tives; Krupp et al., 2011; Krupp & Taylor, 2013). In general,
individuals are expected to cooperate more with kin than with
nonkin but to avoid them sexually, to decrease the risks of
inbreeding (DeBruine, 2005).
Although some studies of human phenotype matching use
naturally occurring individual variation in similarity (e.g.,
Apicella & Marlowe, 2004; Kaminski, Dridi, Graff, & Gentaz,
2009), experimental manipulations are also possible. In this
regard, the methods of choice are to either digitally ``morph''
or ``transform'' images of strangers' faces with images of par-
ticipants' faces and ask participants to evaluate or interact with
these altered images. The results of research using these images
strongly suggest that judgments of facial similarity are made
for the purpose of estimating kinship and are little affected by
differences in age or sex (DeBruine et al., 2009; Maloney &
Dal Martello, 2006). Furthermore, facial self-resemblance
increases cooperative behavior, trust, and sexual aversion,
interacts with other kinship cues, and is distinct from more
general preferences for familiarity (Dal Martello, DeBruine,
& Maloney, 2015; DeBruine, 2002, 2004, 2005; DeBruine
et al., 2011; Krupp et al., 2008; Krupp, DeBruine, Jones, &
Lalumie
`re, 2012). Thus, facial self-resemblance can be thought
of as a cue of kinship that influences our attributions and treat-
ment of others. Little research, however, has examined how we
respond to treatment by self-resembling others. For example,
how do our reactions vary when we suffer rejection at the hands
of ``perceived'' kin? To explore this issue, we expanded the
research on facial self-resemblance by connecting it to work on
social rejection.
Social Rejection
Humans are a social species, possessing psychological and
behavioral adaptations designed for the purpose of forming and
maintaining groups (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). The establish-
ment of social connections ensures access to resources and
support and thus is essential to maximizing inclusive fitness.
Consequently, individuals have a visceral negative reaction
when their sense of belonging to or acceptance in a group is
threatened. Indeed, social rejection can lead to hurt, sadness,
loneliness, anger, anxiety, and decreased state self-esteem
(Leary & Leder, 2009; Richman & Leary, 2009).
Much of the recent research on social rejection has used
Cyberball, a virtual ball-tossing game developed to study ostra-
cism (Williams, Cheung, & Choi, 2000; Williams & Jarvis,
2006). Participants play with at least two other, ostensible
players, tossing a ball back and forth among themselves. A
welcome page presents a cover story that describes the game
as a means of practicing ``mental visualization skills,'' and
many aspects of the game are customizable, including the num-
ber of ball tosses, speed of each toss, number of other players,
and pictures and text labels for each player. Typically, there are
two conditions in the game: inclusion and exclusion. In the
inclusion condition, the other, preprogramed players toss the
ball to the focal participant as often as they toss it to one
another (i.e., one third of the time if there are two other play-
ers). In the exclusion condition, however, the other ostensible
players toss the ball twice to the participant and thereafter only
to each other, ignoring the participant altogether. The most
common dependent measure is a questionnaire assessing parti-
cipants' mood and need satisfaction (i.e., ratings of belonging,
self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence; Zadro,
Williams, & Richardson, 2004). Cyberball has been shown to
reliably induce an aversive and distressing rejection experi-
ence--even when, for example, exclusion results in monetary
reward (van Beest & Williams, 2006) or the participant is
informed that he or she is playing with a computer rather than
with real people (Zadro et al., 2004).
Of particular relevance to the current problem, several stud-
ies have also examined how various characteristics of the ostra-
cizing players moderate people's responses to being ostracized
within the game. The results have been inconsistent for simi-
larity or in-group­out-group status of the ostracizers, with
some studies finding stronger effects of group membership
on the psychological impact of rejection than others (Bernstein,
Sacco, Young, Hugenberg, & Cook, 2010; Gonsalkorale &
Williams, 2007; Sacco, Bernstein, Young, & Hugenberg,
2014; Williams et al., 2000).
To our knowledge, only one study has examined the effects
of kinship on responses to ostracism. In a study by Sreekrishnan
et al. (2014), children aged 9­12 years believed they were
playing with their mother and a stranger child of their own sex,
whereas mothers believed they were playing the game with their
child and a stranger mother. After 108 trials of inclusion, parti-
cipants were excluded for 44 trials and then rated their mood and
need satisfaction. Children reported lower mood and need satis-
faction than did their mothers.
Unfortunately, this study had several shortcomings. First,
mothers and their children differed from strangers not just with
respect to kinship cues but also with respect to familiarity.
Moreover, mothers and their children had preexisting relation-
ships. Consequently, we do not know whether the effects are
due to kinship or to relationship closeness, which also has been
shown to yield more negative responses to ostracism (Arriaga,
Capezza, Reed, Wesselmann, & Williams, 2014). Second, chil-
dren are dependent on their mothers for access to resources,
care, and support, but mothers are not dependent on their chil-
dren for these things (Sreekrishnan et al., 2014). Thus, we do
not know whether the divergent responses are due to differen-
tial effects of kinship or to this power differential. Relatedly,
mothers and their children differ in age, and perhaps deve-
lopmental stage played a role in participants' responses
2 Evolutionary Psychology
(Sreekrishnan et al., 2014). Third, the study lacked key com-
parison conditions, such as having some participants play only
with nonkin (i.e., two strangers) to more directly compare the
effects of exclusion by kin versus nonkin. Furthermore,
although inclusion and exclusion were manipulated, these con-
ditions were always presented in the same order (inclusion
followed by exclusion), and participants completed the self-
report measure only at the end of the exclusion trials. As a
result, the effects of inclusion versus exclusion by kin--as
endorsed on the self-report measure--could not be compared.
The Current Research
Given that familial networks have historically provided
humans with both direct and indirect fitness benefits, we rea-
soned that inclusion in mutually beneficial activities by kin
might elicit more positive feelings than inclusion by nonkin
and, conversely, that exclusion by kin may be especially unex-
pected and distressing relative to exclusion by nonkin. Conse-
quently, we sought to test the hypotheses that individuals have
(1) lesser feelings of rejection when included in and (2) greater
feelings of rejection when excluded from group activities by
kin, relative to inclusion and exclusion, respectively, by non-
kin. Recent work by van der Molen et al. (in press) provides
support for the notion that individuals have different neural
responses to social rejection that is expected versus unex-
pected. However, such neural activity does not always correlate
with subjective distress (Baddam et al., 2016), which is argu-
ably of greater practical interest. Expanding on the work of
Sreekrishnan et al. (2014), we had participants play two games
of Cyberball wherein we experimentally manipulated percep-
tions of kinship via facial self-resemblance of the other players,
used a within-subjects design that counterbalanced the order of
inclusion/exclusion and kinship conditions, and collected par-
ticipants' responses on a ``rejection feelings'' questionnaire
after each game. We predicted that participants would feel less
rejected following inclusion and more rejected following
exclusion from a Cyberball game when their partners were
self-resembling than when they were not.
Method
Participants
Undergraduate students (N ¼ 104) enrolled in an introductory
psychology course participated in this study. They received
either an additional 2% toward their final exam grade or
US$10 per hour if they had already received maximum course
credit. The research protocols were approved by the Queen's
University General Research Ethics Board.
Following standard practice (e.g., DeBruine, 2002, 2004,
2005; DeBruine et al., 2011; Krupp et al., 2008, 2012), we used
a yoking procedure to compare the responses of two different
participants to inclusion or exclusion by the same set of faces,
where these faces were self-resembling to one participant and
nonself-resembling to the other in a given game. Hence, both
participants in a yoked pair saw ostensible partners with the
same faces behave in the same ways; one participant in each
pair served as the ``experimental'' participant and the other as
his or her ``control,'' and these roles were switched between the
two games (i.e., inclusion and exclusion conditions). Conse-
quently, any effects of the manipulation could be attributed to
self-resemblance and not to some more general effect. Due to
difficulties finding another participant of the same sex and self-
reported racial background in time for the second session (see
below), the data for 14 participants were omitted from the
analyses, thus yielding a sample size of 45 yoked pairs or
90 participants (76 women, 14 men; racial background:
64 European, 17 East Asian, and 9 other groups including
people who endorsed multiple racial backgrounds).
Materials
Self-resemblance manipulation. Custom-built digital transforma-
tion software (Tiddeman, Burt, & Perrett, 2001) was used to
create self-resembling transforms for all participants (Krupp
et al., 2012). A photograph of each participant, centered in the
frame with a neutral expression, was cropped to a standard size
(320 Â 400 pixels). Similarly standardized photographs of
strangers (base faces) were obtained from a database of past
research participants, and two base faces of the same sex and
racial background were selected for each participant. The shape
of each participant's face was delineated by placing 179 points
around the face. After standardizing all photographs for inter-
pupillary distance, the software computed the difference in
shape between each participant's face and an appropriate com-
posite face (i.e., an average face of the same sex and racial
background as the participant). Fifty percent of this difference
was then added to the shape of each selected base face. Con-
sequently, two same-sex, same-race transforms were generated
for each participant. A 50% transformation is the strongest
transformation at which participants do not consciously detect
self-resemblance and are sufficient to elicit the behavioral
effects previously described (e.g., greater cooperation with
self-resembling others; DeBruine, 2004). The hair, clothing,
jewelry, and background of the transformed photographs
remained the same as those of the base faces (for photographic
examples of the facial self-resemblance manipulation, see
Krupp et al., 2011, 2012). The photos were resized to 200 Â
250 pixels to fit into the Cyberball user interface.
Inclusion/exclusion manipulation. Participant pairs played one
game of Cyberball in which they were included and one game
in which they were excluded, in counterbalanced order. In all
cases, each participant played with two ostensible partners rep-
resented by face images on the screen. In the inclusion condi-
tion, participants received the ball exactly one third of the time.
In the exclusion condition, participants received the ball twice
at the beginning of the game and then never again.
Rejection feelings questionnaire. After each Cyberball game, par-
ticipants completed a 30-item questionnaire designed to
Parsons et al. 3
measure feelings of rejection (cf. Zadro et al., 2004). Items
within each section were presented to participants in a rando-
mized order. Mood was assessed using 4 items that were rated
on a 9-point bipolar scale: bad/good, happy/sad, tense/relaxed,
and aroused/not aroused. Four psychological needs that are
known to be affected by social rejection (Williams, 1997,
2001) were assessed by 4 items each: belonging (e.g., ``I felt
like an outsider during the Cyberball game''), control (e.g., ``I
felt somewhat frustrated during the Cyberball game''), self-
esteem (e.g., ``During the Cyberball game, I felt good about
myself''), and meaningful existence (e.g., ``I felt nonexistent
during the Cyberball game''). We also included 10 other ques-
tions: 3 items assessed other feelings about the game (e.g., ``I
enjoyed playing the Cyberball game''), 3 items were related to
feeling rejected or accepted (e.g., ``To what extent do you feel
you were being ignored or excluded by the other players?''),
and 3 items pertained to liking for or being liked by the other
participants (e.g., ``How much do you like the other players?'').
Participants indicated to what extent each statement was true
for them on a 9-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 9 (very much
so). One other item was included as a manipulation check for
the inclusion/exclusion manipulation (e.g., ``What percent of
the throws were thrown to you?'').
Although many studies examine the effects of Cyberball on
five different dependent measures (mood and the four basic
needs) without first examining the structure of the measures,
we did not have specific predictions for how our kinship
manipulation would affect, for example, need for control ver-
sus meaningfulness. Consequently, we were interested in deter-
mining the most parsimonious combination of the responses to
rejection. To this end, we conducted principal axis factor anal-
yses for the 29 items scored on the 1­9 scale using the psych
package (Revelle, 2016) in R (R Development Core Team,
2008) and following the recommendations of Fabrigar,
Wegener, MacCallum, and Strahan (1999). We also separately
examined the items for the first and second games. In both
cases, the scree plot supported a one-factor solution, whereas
a parallel analysis suggested a three-factor solution, so we
examined those two models for each time point. The eigenva-
lues for the three factors ranged from 1.29 to 13.17 for Game 1
and from 1.34 to 14.97 for the second game with the first factor
having the largest eigenvalue and accounting for the most var-
iance as is necessitated by a principal axis factor analysis. The
three-factor solutions had a large number of cross loadings,
which made it difficult to interpret. Thus, the more parsimo-
nious single-factor solution was preferred and was deemed
``feelings of rejection.'' This one factor accounted for 48% and
59% of the variance in participants' responses for the first and
second games, respectively.
The following 3 items were excluded because they did not
load substantially on this factor (loadings were less than .29 for
Game 1 and less than .37 for Game 2) and yielded item­total
correlations of less than .30 in subsequent item analyses for
each game: the ``aroused/not aroused'' mood item, ``Life is
meaningless,'' and ``I am in control of my life.'' After reverse
scoring the appropriate items, a mean score of the remaining
items was computed, such that higher scores represented
greater feelings of rejection. The Cronbach's a for this index
of rejection feelings was .97 for each game, indicating excel-
lent internal consistency.
Procedure
The study consisted of two sessions, set approximately 1 week
apart. In the first session, participants were photographed and
informed that their image would be used in the second session,
which would involve playing a game with other participants
over a computer. They also provided demographic information,
which we used to help yoke them to another participant of the
same sex and racial background for the second session. For the
remainder of the time, they engaged in an unrelated experi-
ment. During the week between sessions, each participant's
photograph was delineated and used to create two self-
resembling transforms for him or her.
In the second session, the experimenter informed partici-
pants that they were to play two online games with students
from other universities. Following the procedure used by
Krupp, DeBruine, and Barclay (2008), the experimenter told
participants to begin by reading the on-screen instructions
while she left the room to make a mock phone call to a labora-
tory at another university, on the pretense of ensuring that the
other players were ready to begin. After the experimenter fin-
ished the call, she told the participants to begin playing the
game when they were ready. Both participants in each yoked
pair were randomly assigned to the same order of rejection
conditions (inclusion followed by exclusion or exclusion fol-
lowed by inclusion). Each yoked pair was also randomly
assigned to an order of photo presentation for the two Cyberball
games, such that one participant's self-resembling transforms
were used to represent the two other players in the first game
and the other participant's self-resembling transforms were
used to represent the two other players in the second game.
In this way, one participant would play the first game with his
or her perceived kin while the other participant served as his or
her yoked control. In the second game, the kinship condition
for each participant was switched: The participant who served
as the yoked control in the first game now played with per-
ceived kin whereas the other participant now served as his or
her yoked control.
Once participants completed the rejection feelings question-
naire that followed the first game, the experimenter reentered
the room to load the second game and to inform the participants
that they would be playing with two new partners. As outlined
above, each participant played the second game in the rejection
and kinship conditions opposite to the conditions of the first
game (e.g., if a given participant was excluded by perceived kin
in the first game, he or she was included by nonkin in the
second game). After completing the rejection feelings ques-
tionnaire for a second time, participants answered questions
about the experiment itself to probe for suspicion. Participants
did not appear to detect the self-resemblance manipulation:
When asked what the experiment was about or if anything
4 Evolutionary Psychology
seemed unusual, no participants made any reference to the
other players resembling themselves or otherwise appearing
unusual. Finally, participants were debriefed, compensated,
and thanked for their time.
Analysis of Self-Resemblance Bias
The procedure for computing a measure of self-resemblance
bias was adapted from DeBruine (2005) and Krupp et al.
(2008). For each game played, the mean rejection feelings
score for the participant in the control (i.e., nonself-resem-
bling) condition was subtracted from that of the yoked parti-
cipant in the experimental (i.e., self-resembling) condition. In
this way, a self-resemblance bias score was computed for
each game played, allowing us to determine the effect of
self-resemblance on rejection feelings in response to inclusion
or exclusion.
A difference score of zero would indicate that participants in
a yoked pair responded in the same way to the same faces,
regardless of self-resemblance. In this case, the participants'
responses would more likely have resulted from something
inherent about the faces being viewed (e.g., their attractive-
ness) or to being included or excluded in general. A nonzero
difference score would indicate that participants in a yoked pair
responded differently to the same faces, implicating self-
resemblance as the cause of the difference. We predicted that
participants would exhibit a negative self-resemblance bias
when included, meaning that those in the experimental condi-
tion would experience lesser feelings of rejection than those in
the control condition. Conversely, we predicted that partici-
pants would exhibit a positive self-resemblance bias when
excluded, meaning that those in the experimental condition
would experience greater feelings of rejection than those in the
control condition.
Results
A 2 (inclusion/exclusion) Â 2 (order) mixed-design analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was conducted to evaluate the effect of
inclusion/exclusion condition, as well as the order of these
conditions, on feelings of rejection experienced by each parti-
cipant. As this analysis used individual participants as the unit
of analysis, the data for all participants (N ¼ 104) were used,
with feelings of rejection as the dependent variable. The main
effect of inclusion/exclusion condition was significant,
F(1, 102) ¼ 359.13, p < .001, partial Z2 ¼ .78. The main effect
of order was also significant, F(1, 102) ¼ 4.05, p ¼ .047, partial
Z2 ¼ .04. These main effects, however, were qualified by a
significant interaction between rejection condition and order,
F(1, 102) ¼ 8.26, p ¼ .005, partial Z2 ¼ .08.
To evaluate the nature of this interaction, four t-tests for use
with mixed designs (Toothaker, 1991) were conducted with a
corrected a of .013. The means and standard deviations used
for these pairwise comparisons are presented in Table 1. As
expected, compared to the inclusion condition, participants
experienced significantly greater feelings of rejection in the
exclusion condition both when exclusion preceded inclusion,
t(102) ¼ 15.33, p < .001, and when it followed inclusion,
t(102) ¼ 11.08, p < .001. Within the exclusion condition, feel-
ings of rejection did not significantly differ based on order,
t(102) ¼ 0.55, p ¼ .580. Within the inclusion condition, how-
ever, participants experienced significantly greater feelings of
rejection when included in the first game than when included in
the second game, t(102) ¼ À3.45, p < .001.
Self-Resemblance Bias
To test for an effect of self-resemblance within each rejection
condition, two single-sample t-tests were conducted. The
dependent variable for both tests was self-resemblance bias,
computed as outlined above. These tests used yoked pairs as
the unit of analysis, so only the data for yoked participants
(N ¼ 45 yoked pairs) were used. As predicted, the mean self-
resemblance bias score in the inclusion condition (M ¼ À0.24,
SD ¼ 1.20) was negative, indicating that participants who were
included by self-resembling partners experienced lesser feel-
ings of rejection than did their yoked controls; however, this
score did not significantly differ from 0, t(44) ¼ À1.36,
p ¼ .182. Also as predicted, the mean self-resemblance bias
score in the exclusion condition (M ¼ 0.09, SD ¼ 1.78) was
positive, indicating that participants who were excluded by
self-resembling partners experienced greater feelings of rejec-
tion than did their yoked controls who were excluded by
nonself-resembling partners; once again, however, this score
was not significantly different from the test value of 0,
t(44) ¼ 0.33, p ¼ .747.
To determine whether the effect of self-resemblance dif-
fered across rejection conditions or as a function of order, a 2
(inclusion/exclusion) Â 2 (order) mixed-design ANOVA was
conducted. This test also used yoked pairs as the unit of anal-
ysis, with self-resemblance bias as the dependent variable. The
main effects of rejection condition and order were both non-
significant, ps > .29, but the interaction between rejection con-
dition and order was marginally significant, F(1, 43) ¼ 3.87,
p ¼ .056, partial Z2 ¼ .08. The nature of this marginal inter-
action was explored further with four t-tests and a corrected a
of .013, as above. The mean self-resemblance bias scores for
each condition are shown in Figure 1. When inclusion was
followed by exclusion, the self-resemblance bias differed sig-
nificantly between the inclusion condition for which the differ-
ence score was negative, and exclusion condition for which the
bias score was positive, t(43) ¼ 2.17, p ¼ .035. All other pair-
wise comparisons were nonsignificant, ps > .013.

To further clarify the effect and more directly test our
predictions, we used one-sample t-tests to compare the self-
resemblance bias means to 0. When excluded first, the self-
resembling bias mean was not significantly different from 0
when participants were either included, t(22) ¼ 0.48, p ¼ .638,
or excluded, t(22) ¼ 0.53, p ¼ .604. When included first, as
predicted, participants felt less rejected when included by self-
resembling than by nonself-resembling others, t(21) ¼ 2.05,
p ¼ .053; however, participants did not differ significantly in
their responses to rejection when excluded by self-resembling
versus nonself-resembling others, t(21) ¼ 1.09, p ¼ .290.
Discussion
As expected, given extensive previous research, participants
experienced significantly greater feelings of rejection when
excluded than when included in games of Cyberball. Further-
more, exclusion was approximately equally hurtful when it was
experienced prior to or following inclusion by a different set of
partners. However, game order affected the experience of
inclusion such that participants felt less rejected when they had
been excluded in a previous game. This suggests that inclusion
feels particularly rewarding when it follows such a powerfully
distressing social event. Participants who were excluded prior
to inclusion might, for instance, have felt that they had over-
come an obstacle to group membership, making such inclusion
feel especially satisfying.
As genetic relatedness tends to foster cooperation, we
hypothesized that humans would have evolved positive senti-
ments to inclusion and negative sentiments to exclusion from
kin networks. However, in the omnibus model, self-resemblance
did not cause significantly (1) lesser feelings of rejection when
participants were included in group play or (2) greater feelings
of rejection when participants were excluded from group play.
Nevertheless, closer inspection revealed an interesting effect of
the order in which the games were played: The predicted
pattern of self-resemblance effects did emerge when partici-
pants experienced inclusion first and exclusion second but
only for the inclusion condition. Therefore, we conclude that
participants found inclusion by self-resembling partners to be
more rewarding than inclusion by nonself-resembling partners
in the first game. As outlined previously, we believe this is
due to the adaptive benefits (e.g., resource sharing) of being
included in kin networks.
Although the mean was in the anticipated direction for
exclusion by self-resembling partners to be more painful than
exclusion by nonself-resembling partners in the second game,
the difference was not significantly different from 0. We dis-
cuss reasons for this in more detail below. Moreover, we did
not find any significant differences for participants who expe-
rienced exclusion first. In other research using Cyberball, the
effect of exclusion on affect has generally been quite powerful,
and for many years, researchers did not believe it was possible
to find moderation of its effects because it was such a strong
situation (McDonald & Donnellan, 2012). Thus, we suspect
that our results for self-resemblance bias were weaker for the
exclusion condition than we expected because exposure to this
condition obscured or interacted with other events or processes
in the conditions that followed it.
Indeed, there may be carryover effects of exclusion on sub-
sequent interactions. For instance, participants may be emo-
tionally overwhelmed--to the point of distraction--by the
experience of being excluded, making them less likely to detect
self-resemblance in a later game. If not impairing attention in
general, exclusion may shift one's focus of attention to cues
other than self-resemblance, such as the number of tosses
received, in ensuing interactions. Another possibility is that
prior exclusion by self-resembling partners yields a more pos-
itive interpretation of inclusion by nonself-resembling partners
than is typical, perhaps because exclusion signals that the par-
ties are in fact unrelated. Alternatively, perhaps the critical
difference lies not in this order of inclusion/exclusion condi-
tions, but in the opposite: Exclusion by self-resembling part-
ners in the second game may be even more unexpected and
distressing to individuals who have previously been included
by nonself-resembling others and who thereafter would under-
standably expect--even if unconsciously--to be accepted by
perceived kin.
Limitations and Future Directions
A potential limitation of our study is that the self-resemblance
manipulation was too subtle when presented within the Cyber-
ball interface. If true, this may explain the nonsignificant effect
of self-resemblance on social rejection when exclusion was
followed by inclusion: Participants may have been more easily
distracted by exclusion when the self-resemblance manipula-
tion was relatively weak. Future Cyberball studies might try

using larger facial images or stronger than 50% transformations
to determine whether these changes make self-resemblance
more salient and therefore increase the magnitude of self-
resemblance effects.
It may also be that the crossover effect we find here is an
artifact of a within-subjects design. Consequently, it would be
interesting to compare the results of within-subjects and
between-subjects designs. For instance, participants might play
a single game of Cyberball, wherein half of the participants are
included and the other half excluded by their partners. More-
over, if using a within-subjects design, it might be interesting to
provide a neutral task between Cyberball games to determine
whether any carryover effects of exclusion or inclusion persist.
Conclusions
Some researchers have contended that social rejection, partic-
ularly in the form of ostracism, is so aversive a phenomenon
that moderation is difficult, if not impossible (e.g., McDonald
& Donnellan, 2012). However, others have challenged that
claim (Sacco et al., 2014; Williams, 2009). The current study
adds further support to the latter position, showing that even a
subtle manipulation--exposure to self-resembling partners--
can moderate the powerful psychological impact of social
exclusion, if only under specific conditions. Specifically, our
study has shown that self-resemblance can alter the subjective
experience of social inclusion and exclusion, at least when
exclusion follows inclusion. Future research should establish
an effect of self-resemblance on responses to inclusion and
exclusion separately, before further investigation into potential
order effects. In addition, we expect that more salient self-
resemblance manipulations will yield clearer results and stron-
ger effects. In any case, we believe that our findings justify
further forays into the emotional responses that individuals
have to the actions of their putative kin, and how these
responses might interact with other psychological processes.
