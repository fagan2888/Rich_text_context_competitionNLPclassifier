Introduction
On 18 February 2010, troops stormed the Nigerien presi-
dential palace and arrested President Mamadou Tandja.1
Though Tandja was elected in free and fair elections in
1999, his government took an autocratic turn a decade later
when (among other things) he dissolved the National
Assembly and passed a constitutional referendum to extend
his rule another three years. Upon ousting Tandja, the coup
leaders formed the Supreme Council for the Restoration of
Democracy (CSRD) to rule the country, and to `make Niger
an example of democracy and good governance.' Citizens
celebrated, and the opposition proclaimed it an opportunity
to restore democracy.
Observers around the globe wondered whether the coup
was a positive development (Miller, 2011). News headlines
included, `Niger coup: Can Africa use military power for
good?' (Armstrong, 2010) and `Niger: A coup for democ-
racy?'(BBC News, 2010). Their optimism was well founded.
The CSRD oversaw free and fair elections in early 2011, and
former opposition leader Mahamadou Issoufou assumed the
presidency a few months later (Freedom House, 2012).
This was not the first time the Nigerien military staged a
coup to impose democratization. The competitive elections
that installed Tandja in 1999 came after a coup that killed
Ibrahim Bare Mainassara, a strongman who had ruled Niger
since 1996. Nor is the Nigerien experience an isolated one.
So-called `good coups'­ or coups against dictatorships that
pave the way for democracy ­ have occurred in places
ranging from Portugal in 1974 to Mali in 1991 to Guinea-
Bissau in 2003.
These events have generated arguments that coups have
the potential to be good for democracy. By providing a
`shock' to the system, coups may create opportunities for
political liberalization that would not exist otherwise
(Thyne and Powell, 2014: 2­3). Summarizing these argu-
ments, Paul Collier writes that `coups and the threat of
coups can be a significant weapon in fostering democracy'
(Collier, 2009).
Can coups really foster democracy? We explore this
question by looking at the political systems that follow
coups in autocracies, as well as the ensuing levels of repres-
sion. Our aim is simply to establish what the empirical pat-
terns look like.2 Because scholars have observed that `good
coups' have dramatically increased in frequency since the
end of the Cold War (for reasons we summarize in the sec-
tion that follows), we emphasize throughout how these pat-
terns compare during and after the Cold War (Marinov and
Goemans, 2014).
We begin by noting that coups against dictatorships
replace the dictator and sometimes other leaders as well. The
new leaders then choose one of three possible outcomes: no
regime change (e.g. the 1975 Nigerian coup that replaced

Abstract
A number of recent studies argue that coups can help usher in democracy. We examine this relationship empirically by
looking at the political regimes that follow coups in autocracies, as well as the level of repression against citizens. We
find that, though democracies are occasionally established in the wake of coups, more often new authoritarian regimes
emerge, along with higher levels of state-sanctioned violence.

GeneralYakubu Gowon with Brigadier Murtala Muhammad,
without changing either the group in power or the rules for
governing); the ouster of the incumbent dictatorship and the
establishment of a new one (as in the 1971 Ugandan coup
that toppled the civilian government led by Milton Obote and
brought General Idi Amin to power); and the ouster of the
dictatorship followed by democratization (as in Niger in
1999 and 2010).
We find that since the Cold War's end, regime change
of some sort increasingly follows successful coups: 68%
pre-1990, compared to 90% afterward.3 (The rest are
coups that only reshuffle the leadership.)4 Though democ-
ratization coups have become more frequent, the most
common outcome is still the ouster of the incumbent dic-
tatorship by a different group of autocrats intent on
replacing one arbitrary distribution of benefits and suf-
fering with another. At least half of all coups ­ 56% dur-
ing the Cold War and 50% from 1990 to 2015 ­ initiate
new authoritarian regimes. For example, even though
Nigerien coups in 1999 and 2010 brought democracy,
coups in 1974 and 1996 established new dictatorships.
Basic summary statistics indicate that both before the
Cold War and afterward, coups are most often followed
by new dictatorships.
Statistical tests that take into account a variety of poten-
tially confounding factors tell a similar story: the associa-
tion between coups and democratization is statistically
insignificant, while that between coups and the establish-
ment of new dictatorships is robust.
Looking at failed as well as successful coups fails to
yield a rosier picture. Though some have argued that coup
attempts, such as the Burundian military's failed power
grab in 2015, can set in motion changes leading to democ-
ratization (Noyes, 2015), our study indicates that this is
unlikely. Regime change is less likely to follow a coup
attempt than a successful coup, and when it does, the regime
that emerges is more likely to be a new dictatorship than a
democracy.
We also examine the association between different types
of coups and repression. Using an annual latent measure of
repression, we find that coups that launch new dictatorships
are followed by an increase in repression in the calendar
year after the coup compared to the year before it. In con-
trast, coups that lead to democracy are associated with a
decrease in repression, but only for post-Cold War cases.
We supplement this with an analysis of event data for 49
coup attempts that occurred after 1989, by comparing state-
sanctioned civilian deaths in the 12 post- and 12 pre-coup
months. We find only one case of a coup followed by a drop
in deaths and numerous cases of increases in violence after
different types of coup events.
The central message of this study is clear: though coups
against autocrats have sometimes led to democratization,
more often they install a new set of autocratic elites and
expose citizens to higher levels of repression.
The study is organized as follows. It first provides some
background: a definition of coups, and a description of how
patterns associated with them have changed over time.
Next, it evaluates the link between coups and regime
change empirically. It then investigates the connection
between coups and repression. The final section summa-
rizes our findings.
Background
Coups are successful efforts `by the military or other elites
within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive
using unconstitutional means' (Powell and Thyne, 2011:
252). Though civilians may support coups, at their core
coups are a technology that can only be used by the mili-
tary, police, and security forces.
The most basic goal of a coup is to bring about a change
in leadership, but often coup plotters also seek more sub-
stantial political transformation. They may announce their
intention to hold democratic elections in the near future and
even offer a timeline for the transition. However, they do
not always fulfill such promises, as in Egypt where the
military that promised a transition later ousted elected
President Morsi in 2013 and remains in control.
Recent research, however, suggests that the conse-
quences of coups may have changed since the end of the
Cold War. Not only have coups declined in frequency, but
those that occur are increasingly followed by competitive
elections (Marinov and Goemans, 2014). From 1950 to
1989, 14% of successful coups against dictatorships led to
democracy within two years, while 40% did so from 1990
to 2015.
A variety of factors could explain this. For one, conspir-
ators often state that the desire to save their countries from
autocratic incumbents motivated them. They may opt for
free and fair elections simply because they value them.
Even when junta members are less altruistic, coups may
lead to democratization because of the incentives created
by international pressure in the post-Cold War era (Marinov
and Goemans, 2014). Threats to suspend foreign aid can
motivate the military to hold elections quickly.
In summary, there are a variety of mechanisms through
which coups might pave the way for democratization
(Thyne and Powell, 2014), as well as compelling argu-
ments for why they might be more likely to do so since the
Cold War's end (Marinov and Goemans, 2014). Have coups
become good for democracy, though? In the next section,
we evaluate this question empirically.
Coups and regime change
An investigation of the consequences of coups should take
into account the kind of leadership the coup aimed to
replace. From 1950 to 1989, nearly half of all dictatorships
(49%) suffered from at least one coup, while only a third of
Derpanopoulos et al. 3
democracies did (35%). Since 1990, coups have been much
less frequent but just as likely to occur in democracies as in
dictatorships (12%). Democracies ended by coups, how-
ever, tend to rebound quickly (Marinov and Goemans,
2014). One reason competitive elections more often follow
coups may therefore be that a larger proportion of them
now occur in places that tend to redemocratize quickly.
Yet, few would argue that coups against democratic gov-
ernments are `good' for democracy, even in cases like 2009
Honduras, where the Supreme Court sided with the military
and the autocratic interlude was short. Democracy, at a
minimum, guarantees that transitions from one leader to the
next occur through a free and fair process. Thus coups in
democracies indicate democratic backsliding at a minimum
and usually outright democratic breakdown.
To avoid treating cases of quick redemocratization after
coups against democracies as `good for democracy', we
limit our investigation to coups against dictatorships. We
examine how coups influence the likelihood of two distinct
types of autocratic regime collapse: democratization and
adverse regime change (Geddes et al., 2014).5 The latter
constitute events during which one group of autocratic
elites replaces another ­ as for example, when coups
replaced monarchies with military-led dictatorships in
Egypt, Iraq, Libya and Yemen. Our main independent vari-
able is an indicator of whether a coup occurred in the obser-
vation year or either of the two years prior (Thyne and
Powell, 2014).
We estimate a linear model with regime-case fixed
effects.6 Doing so enables a within-regime comparison of
what follows a coup, while conditioning-out all differences
between autocratic regimes (e.g. level of development,
colonial history, how the regime seized power). Crucially,
this approach accounts for autocratic regime type, includ-
ing whether the incumbent autocracy is ruled by the mili-
tary. Accounting for differences among regimes, such as
whether a military junta leads the dictatorship, is important,
because military dictatorships often use coups as a method
for reshuffling leaders, and they are also more likely to
democratize, though not necessarily because of coups
(Geddes, 1999). The specification also controls for regime
duration, leader duration and year fixed effects. To examine
the effect of the end of the Cold War, we estimate separate
variables for Pre-1990 coups and Post-1989 coups. This is
similar to estimating an interaction between time period
and coups; the year fixed effects subsume the time period
constituent term.
The sample covers all autocratic regime-years in 285
dictatorships from 1950­2015. A model with democratiza-
tion as the dependent variable estimates the effect of coups
on the probability of transitioning from autocracy to
democracy, from one calendar year to the next:

effect of coups on the probability of transitioning from
autocracy to a new autocracy, from one calendar year to the
next: P N A

The top panel of Figure 1 plots the estimates. The top
coefficient in each pair (circle) is from a model with democ-
ratization as the dependent variable, while the bottom coef-
ficient (triangle) is from a model in which adverse regime
change is the dependent variable.
The figure shows that successful coups during the Cold
War are not correlated with democratization; post-Cold
War coups are, but the estimate is not statistically signifi-
cant. A successful coup is, however, associated with an
increase in the chance of transition from one autocracy
to another; a 19% increase during the Cold War and 27%
afterward. Both estimates are statistically significant. This
suggests that coups destabilize dictatorships not by improv-
ing prospects for democratization, but by boosting the odds
that a new dictatorship replaces the old one.
We next consider whether coup attempts ­ regardless of
whether the coup effort succeeds or fails ­ are associated
with higher chances of democratization. It is possible that
Figure 1. Coups and autocratic regime transitions.
4 Research and Politics 
when coups fail, they set in motion events conducive to
democratization down the road. Thyne and Powell (2014)
argue, for example, that failed coups increase the likelihood
of democratization by sending a signal to incumbents that
military support for the status quo has declined. Incumbents,
fearing a future successful coup, then opt for political liber-
alization, which gives them a better position from which to
negotiate their exit than would a coup.
The data, again from Powell and Thyne (2011), show
that about half of all attempted coups fail. The likelihood
of failure varies with time period: 48% of attempted coups
failed during the Cold War and 63% after it. In any case,
regime change rarely follows failed coups: 6% of failed
coups were followed by democratization and 3% by the
establishment of a new dictatorship. In summary, coups
fail frequently, and when they do, regime change rarely
follows.
The lower panel of Figure 1 is similar to the top panel,
but looks at all coup attempts (successful or failed). It
reveals a similar pattern: coup attempts are correlated with
an increased probability of adverse regime change, but the
effect on democratization is not statistically significant.
These findings contrast with recent research on the
democratizing effects of coups, notably Thyne and Powell
(2014). To explore why our results differ, we re-examine
their statistical tests in the Online Appendix. We show that
the `democratizing effect' of coups is not robust to includ-
ing either a control for military regime or regime-case fixed
effects. These are not trivial changes to the specification
because they address the most important omitted variable
­ namely, military regime leadership ­ which is correlated
with both coups and democratization. Furthermore, we
show that even using their specification, the association
between coups and the probability of democratization is
quite small in the post-Cold War period (1.2%).
Regime change is not the only way coups can affect citi-
zen welfare, however. In the next section, we investigate
the relationship between coups and repression.
Coups and repression
On 23 December 2008, Captain Dadis Camara staged a
coup in Guinea, just a day after the death of longtime dic-
tator Lansana Conté. Camara established the National
Committee for Democracy and Development (CNDD) to
control government (Walker, 2008). Though some citizens
initially welcomed the coup as a respite from the repres-
siveness of Conté's government, their hopes of greater
freedom were soon dashed. Reports emerged in the months
that followed of arbitrary arrests and detentions, restric-
tions on citizens' political rights, and criminal activities
organized by the military (Human Rights Watch, 2009).
The violence peaked on 28 September 2009, when security
forces killed more than 150 citizens participating in anti-
government protests, sparking international condemnation
of the Camara regime and triggering sanctions against it
(Reuters, 2009).
The 2008 coup in Guinea led to the establishment of a
new dictatorship. The events that followed it highlight the
possibility that coups can have damaging consequences for
citizens beyond regime change. At the extreme, coups pre-
cipitated deadly civil conflicts in Algeria (1991­1999) and
Rwanda (1994), while a 1999 coup in Côte d'Ivoire
unleashed a decade of political violence and repression,
culminating in foreign intervention. We explore the coup­
repression nexus in this section.
To measure repression, we use mean estimates of a
latent measure of respect for human rights from Fariss
(2014). This measure accounts for the changing standards
of accountability over time, as human rights norms and
reporting standards have become stricter. We invert it so
that larger values indicate higher repression.
We disaggregate coups into four categories: failed coups
(Failed coups), coups that launch new autocracies (Adverse
change), democratization coups (Democratizing) and coups
that merely reshuffle leaders, causing no regime change
(No change). To estimate the effect of coups on repression,
we compare levels of repression in the year before the coup/
attempt to repression in the year after it, limiting the sample
to dictatorships that experienced coups. The before-and-
after comparison allows us to rule out the possibility that
coups and repression are correlated because coups occur
more frequently in more repressive countries.

it indicates there is more repression in the post-coup than

ing from a separate model for each type of coup: Failed
coups, Adverse change, Democratizing and No change
Derpanopoulos et al. 5
(reshuffling).8 The left panel includes data from 1950 to
2010, while the right panel restricts the sample to the post-
Cold War years. During the full period, repression is lower
after failed coups, democratizing coups and reshuffling
coups, but the effects for Failed coups and No change are
small and not statistically different from zero. Higher
repression follows coups that initiate new dictatorships,
however, consistent with the experience of Guinea after the
2008 coup. In other words, dictatorships that replace other
dictatorships via a coup tend to use more violence against
citizens than the dictatorships they replaced. The post-Cold
War pattern looks similar, but the worsening of repression
following coups that replace one dictatorship with another
is even greater, as is the reduction in repression after
democratizing coups.
We next look at the effect of coups on repression using
event data. We use two sources: the Worldwide Atrocities
Dataset (WAD) (Ulfelder and Schrodt, 2009), and the
Social Conflict in Analysis Database (SCAD) (Salehyan
et al., 2012). The former codes deaths of noncombatants
and includes the years 1995 to 2014. The latter captures
broader manifestations of instability, such as protests and
riots, in Africa and Latin America from 1990 to 2013.
Given our focus on repression, we rely mostly on WAD, but
also use lethal events included in SCAD from 1990 to 1994,
in order to analyse as many coups as possible. Using these
two sources, we create a variable measuring the change in
number of deaths recorded in the 12 months following each
coup event compared to the 12 months preceding it. These
data allow us to focus on repression in the months immedi-
ately before and after coups, unlike the data used in Figure
2. In order to capture repression, we only aggregate deaths
from government-sanctioned lethal atrocities coded in
WAD and deaths from pro-government violence coded in
SCAD.9
Figure 3 displays this information for all coups that
occurred in dictatorships in the years 1990-2014, by coup
type. This includes 30 failed coups, seven democratizing
coups, seven adverse regime change coups and five leader-
reshuffling coups. Boxplots summarize the distribution of
changes in deaths. They show that, for all except reshuf-
fling coups, the median within-country change is zero ­ the
median is the dark line in each box. Though we cannot be
statistically confident that repression increases after coups
­ even for reshuffling coups ­ we nevertheless believe there
are some patterns worth noting.
First, only one (failed) coup event is followed by a
decrease in civilian deaths. No lethal violence occurred
either pre- or post-democratizing coups (D); hence the
whole distribution falls on the zero line. Substantial
increases in repression against citizens follow other kinds
of coup, however. A considerable amount of violence fol-
lows adverse regime change coups (A), consistent with the
annual data evidence in Figure 2. Leader-reshuffling coups
(N) are also associated with an increase in violence.
However, this is owed mostly to one large outlier (which

6 Research and Politics 
has been removed from the graph to aid interpretability).
Finally, increases in post-coup deaths follow a number of
failed coups (F), the modal type in this period.
To sum up the evidence in this section, most coups, suc-
cessful or failed, are followed by greater repression against
citizens.Although yearly indices, which exclude the year of
the coup itself, suggest a possible decrease in repression
after some coups, particularly democratizing ones, event
data, which track the months immediately after coups, doc-
ument no short-term decreases. The annual data allow a
confident claim that substantial increases in repression fol-
low coups initiating new dictatorships, and the monthly
data supplement this claim with suggestive evidence that
more atrocities are committed against citizens.
Conclusion
Several scholars have recently challenged the standard
interpretation of military coups as anti-democratic. Instead,
they argue, a coup can help usher in democracy. Our results
give pause to such optimism.
To assess whether coups are associated with democrati-
zation, we investigated what follows coups against dicta-
tors, excluding coups against democracies. We show that
coups are not systematically correlated with democratiza-
tion, either during the period from 1950 to 2014 or post-
Cold War. On the contrary, the perpetrators of coups tend to
oust dictators only to impose new ones.
Further, we show that many coups in dictatorships
lead to increases in human rights abuses. Using a yearly
repression measure, we show that coups that launch new
dictatorships are followed by increases in state violence
against citizens. With more fine-grained event data, we
note that the year after all but one post-Cold War coup
against dictatorship brings either an increase or no change
in civilian deaths. In short, the months that follow coups
can be bloody, even if the coups themselves were not.

changes to authoritarian rule that continuous measures of
`democraticness' (e.g. Polity) often capture ­ for example,
the 1990 legalization of opposition parties in the former
Zaire. We focus on democratic transitions rather than multi-
party elections, since the latter tell us little about whether
the contest was free and fair. Given that multi-party elec-
tions are common in post-Cold War dictatorships, they are
no longer a good indicator of whether a regime is democra-
tizing (Kendall-Taylor and Frantz, 2014).
