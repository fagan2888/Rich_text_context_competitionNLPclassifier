There are strong moral and economic imperatives for
employers to address the effects of gender-based violence
(GBV) on their employees and business operations. Over the
last two decades, an increasing number of organizations, pre-
dominantly in Western countries, have promoted workplace
strategies that address the ways in which gendered violence
or distinct subsets of GBV--including domestic violence
(DV), sexual violence (SV), intimate partner violence (IPV),
violence against women (VAW), and family and sexual vio-
lence (FSV)--can influence the performance and productiv-
ity of employees in their workplace.
Different approaches to employee disclosures of gendered
violence may include various combinations of a range of
organizational responses, including, but not limited to, devel-
oping specific changes to employment, occupational health
and safety, and antidiscrimination legislation; workplace enti-
tlements secured through collective bargaining; the unilateral
adoption and application of policies and procedures by
employers; and workplace-based awareness raising programs
(Hameed, 2014a). Specific workplace strategies may be
developed and tailored to support individual employees who
are victims of gendered violence within the workplace such
as safety planning; referral to medical, psychosocial, legal,
and protective services; (paid) time off work to access those
services; financial support; and provisions to ensure nondis-
crimination and employees' privacy. Potentially, workplace
strategies may also be implemented to manage employees
who are perpetrators of violence. However, to date, little work
has been undertaken in this area. Together, these various
workplace strategies, their distinct approaches, and various
components benchmark current and evolving workplace

Abstract
There are high levels of family and sexual violence (FSV) in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Many businesses in PNG, like an
increasing number of organizations worldwide, want to address the effects of FSV on their employees and operations to
minimize human suffering and to maximize productivity. To date, a range of workplace strategies designed to address related
forms of violence (FSV, domestic and family violence, sexual violence, intimate partner violence, violence against women, and
gender-based violence) have been developed and implemented, albeit mainly in Western contexts. This article considers the
extent to which these workplace strategies can or should be modified for workplaces in PNG. Findings from participatory
action research undertaken with FSV service providers, advocates, businesses, and their employees in PNG strongly indicate
that workplace strategies should be modified to reflect cultural and other contextual specificities. In particular, workplace
strategies should reflect local understandings about what constitutes FSV, who may perpetrate and who may be victimized
by FSV, and what supports are available to victims of FSV. It is important to note that while the supports examined are
necessarily culturally and contextually specific to PNG, they have subsequently provided important insights relevant for
workplace responses in other developing and industrialized countries, thereby extending the evidence base of possible
workplace strategies generally.

practice in addressing the effects of gendered violence on the
workplace. This article refers to these workplace strategies
collectively as good practice workplace strategies.
In Papua New Guinea (PNG), family and sexual violence
is the preferred term as opposed to gender-based violence,
for reasons described later in this article. Nevertheless, in
view of the inadequate research internationally on FSV and
the workplace, this article also discusses all of the aforemen-
tioned subsets of FSV where the literature is relevant to
workplace responses to FSV in PNG. For clarity, this article
specifies whether the literature referenced particularly
chooses to use any of the following terms--FSV, DV, SV,
IPV, VAW, or GBV.
The Business Case for Responding to
the Effects of FSV on the Workplace
In PNG, in 2014, 16 out of 17 businesses surveyed by the
Business Coalition for Women (BCFW; 2014) answered
"yes" to the question, "Do you believe that FSV or other
forms of violence against women affects your workplace?"
(p. 8). This response from select businesses in PNG resonates
both with the United Nations Commission on the Status of
Women's acknowledgment that VAW can affect the work-
place (Commission on the Status of Women, 2013) and
Klugman et al.'s (2014) schematization of the individual-
level, family-level, and economy-wide effects of VAW by
their intimate partners. Both humanitarian concern for the
pain and suffering of victims of GBV and economic cases
based on the costs to businesses have been evoked worldwide
to persuade businesses to take action to address the effects of
GBV on their employees and organizations (Williams, 2014).
The moral argument for businesses to act on their humani-
tarian concern for victims of FSV is grounded in a human
rights­based approach and strengthened by the "Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the
United Nations `Protect, Respect and Remedy' Framework."
This framework calls on businesses to "seek to prevent or
mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly
linked to their operations, products or services by their busi-
ness relationships, even if they have not contributed to those
impacts" (Ruggie, 2011, Annex Pt. 13). This genre of moral
argument is often evoked to persuade businesses to create
and implement corporate social responsibility charters and is
in keeping with workplace strategies that promote businesses
self-regulating their response to FSV.
The business case to address the effects of GBV on the
workplace is based on economic modeling, which shows that
GBV has "significant economic costs in terms of expenditure
on service provision, lost income for women and their fami-
lies, decreased productivity, and negative impacts on future
human capital formation" (Duvvury et al., 2013, cited in
Williams, 2014, p. 2). McFerran and Micromex (2011)
argued that businesses may directly incur costs as a result of
DV through lost productivity due to employees' absenteeism
and inability to concentrate when they are victims. Other
influential factors include lost productivity due to misuse of
the businesses resources or due to the absenteeism and/or
lack of concentration at work by perpetrators (Employers
Against Domestic Violence, n.d.-a, n.d.-b). McFerran and
Micromex also noted the potential for reduced workplace
safety for victims of DV and the workplace in general result-
ing from perpetrators of DV contacting employees who are
victims of DV or their coworkers at work, attending the
workplace, or apprehending the victim on the way to or from
work. Termination, recruitment, and training costs are also
incurred by businesses when victims of DV are forced to
leave employment or have their employment terminated as a
result of DV (Domestic Violence Workplace Rights and
Entitlements Project, n.d.).
Background to the FSV and the
Workplace in PNG Project
In 2014, select businesses in PNG who wanted to address the
effects of FSV on their workplace approached the BCFW and
the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the
World Bank Group, to request the development of a model
workplace FSV policy suitable to the PNG context. The
BCFW is supported by the IFC under the Country Partnership
Strategy for PNG 2013-2016, which prioritizes "gender
equality as `smart economics'" and places "gender issues . . .
`front and centre'" (The World Bank Group, n.d.-b).
Researchers from the Gendered Violence Research
Network (GVRN) at the University of New South Wales
(UNSW) had previously developed DV rights and entitle-
ments as part of the "Safe at Home, Safe at Work"
(SAHSAW; n.d.-a) program for around 1.6 million workers
in Australia and were keen to learn from PNG nationals how
workplace strategies developed internationally could be
adapted for the PNG context. Specifically, it was important
to understand whether internationally developed workplace
strategies--which mainly presume that the major risk to
employees arises from male violence in intimate partner
relationships--were appropriate to PNG society and whether
referral of employees to services within the community is
practicable in PNG.
This article discusses the key learnings from this process
which included a good practice review of workplace strate-
giesdevelopedby20organizationsinsixcountries(Australia,
Canada, Fiji, Ireland, PNG, and the United States) and par-
ticipatory action research undertaken in 2014. The project
was a collaborative effort between UNSW and Pacific
Adventist University, with FSV advocates and service pro-
viders, and businesses and their employees in PNG. The out-
come demonstrates that good practice workplace responses
to FSV in PNG must be grounded in the local context. It is
important to note that while the supports examined are nec-
essarily culturally and contextually specific to PNG, they
have subsequently provided important insights relevant for
Hameed et al. 3
workplace responses in other developing and industrialized
countries.
This article is structured as follows. The introduction pro-
vides an overview of the diversity of PNG societies, defines
FSV, and examines the available prevalence data for FSV in
PNG and select themes in the literature detailing FSV in PNG.
The next section describes the methodology used for the good
practice review and participatory action research. As partici-
pants' perceptions of FSV are key to understanding context,
their voices form the basis of the "Results and Discussion"
section, which presents key learnings focusing on (a) the need
for a broader definition of what constitutes FSV, (b) the need
to challenge current perceptions of who may perpetrate and
who may be victimized by FSV, and (c) the need to recognize
the complexities of responding to FSV in PNG.
The Diversity of PNG Societies
FSV in PNG is embedded within intersections of multiple
heterogeneous and overlapping PNG societies where indi-
viduals are, to varying degrees, simultaneously subjects and
agents of traditional, modernizing, and other imperatives
(Morley, 1994). PNG societies are characterized by incred-
ible diversity as evidenced by the existence of more than
800 living languages in a nation of around 7.3 million inhab-
itants (DFAT, n.d.-c). PNG is composed of the mainland (the
eastern half of the island of New Guinea) and 600 islands
(DFAT, n.d.-c).
Linguistic, cultural, and geographic diversity is particu-
larly important in understanding PNG societies. Narokobi
(1983), a PNG thought leader, urged that "we should spring
from our cultural values to forge ahead in a world that is
moving more and more towards a confused uniformity,
monotony and insensitivity to the fine, subtle and sublime
beauty of diversity" (p. 7). Nonetheless, Narokobi (1983)
asserted that Melanesian "unity springs not from the nation
state, common currency, common banks, the police and the
military" (p. 7) but by a shared cultural and spiritual vision.
Traditional systems of relationships (or obligations) between
individuals in PNG, as described in the linga franca of tok
pisin, the wantok system, are "characterised by some or all of
the following: (a) common language (wantok--literally "one
talk"), (b) common kinship group, (c) common geographical
area of origin, and (d) common social associations or reli-
gious groups" (Mannan, 1978, p. 200, quoted in de Renzio,
2000, pp. 21-22). Wantok systems, which in urban contexts
tend to include affiliates beyond the kinship group (Mawuli
& Guy, 2007), function as socioeconomic and political net-
works based on respect and reciprocity, and contribute to
members' economic and social welfare (Nanau, 2011). The
wantok system embodies the strong social bonds and bound-
aries of much of PNG society and is at the root of much of
the social cohesion and social conflict evident today.
Individuals may simultaneously be supported by the rela-
tionship and obligations of their wantok system (Mawuli &
Guy, 2007), be in conflict with others from different wantok
systems while attempting to fulfill their roles in the modern
nation-state, which creates its own relationships and
obligations.
The heterogeneity of PNG societies has also been compli-
cated by histories of British, German, and Australian coloni-
zation. PNG gained independence from Australia in
September 1975 (Jolly, 2012b, pp. xix-xx) but continues to
be the subject of Australian foreign policy that emphasizes
"Australia's national interest" (Bishop, 2014). TheAustralian
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT; n.d.-c)
describes Australia's current relationship with PNG as "one
of our most complex and wide ranging." Australia is the larg-
est aid donor to PNG and provided Aus$502.4 million in aid
in 2013/2014 (DFAT, n.d.-a). Australian aid specifically tar-
gets FSV through two primary initiatives. The first initiative
being the "Gender Equality and the Elimination of Gender-
Based Violence" initiative earmarking Aus$19.8 million in
aid for the 2008-2016 period. The second initiative, the
"Pacific Women Shaping Pacific Development," allocated
Aus$58 million for the 2012-2022 period (DFAT, n.d.-d).
PNG is also characterized by high economic inequality.
PNG is a lower middle-income country (The World Bank
Group, 2015) that has experienced strong economic growth
over the last decade (DFAT, n.d.-a) with a per capita GDP of
US$2,138 in 2014 (DFAT, n.d.-b). Yet an estimated 40% of
PNG's population live in poverty (DFAT, n.d.-a). Wealth cre-
ation in PNG is mainly driven by the agricultural and extrac-
tive industries (DFAT, n.d.-c). Income and wealth are
inequitably distributed, with 80% to 85% of the population
who live a "traditional village-based life" deriving their
income from subsistence gardens and small-scale cash crop-
ping (DFAT, n.d.-c). At the other end of the economic spec-
trum, PNG society also encompasses highly educated,
transnationally mobile urban elites, including a growing
number of elite women (Spark, 2014).
The PNG Country Gender Assessment (The World Bank
Group, n.d.-c) is at times quoted to demonstrate that labor
force participation is high for both males and females, esti-
mated to be close to 61% for each cohort. This figure more
reflects the tendency for most rural men and women to
engage in informal economic activities, including farming,
fishing, and trading, all of which may be counted as work-
force participation. In the formal sector, men are almost
twice as likely as women to work for wages (40% of men vs.
24% of women nationally). That gap is consistent across
both urban (43% vs. 23%) and rural (36% vs. 18%) areas. In
reality, only one in eight persons with access to cash income
is female demonstrating clear gender differences in formal
employment in PNG.
Even though the formal employment sector and urbaniza-
tion constitutes a small proportion of PNG livelihoods (Asian
Development Bank, 2014), the importance of this sector
should not be underestimated as the sector characterizes eco-
nomic modernity and is a powerful force in shaping PNG
4 SAGE Open
societies. Employers in PNG may also have a greater role in
their employees' lives, compared with employers in Western
contexts. Employers in PNG often provide employees with
transport, accommodation, and other goods and services
(BCFW, 2014), as these goods and services may not be easily
accessible in the community (Mawuli & Guy, 2007).
Workplaces also may have a greater role in shaping what in
the West would be considered employees' private lives,
through the social norming of what is considered appropriate
behavior for employees even outside work (Spark, 2010).
PNG is also often characterized as a very violent society
with 67% of 135 businesses surveyed in PNG identifying
crime as a major constraint, more than 4 times the regional
average for firms in East Asia and the Pacific (The World
Bank Group, 2014, p. 3). In the survey as
"Crime" was defined as break-ins, vandalism, vehicle theft,
property theft without force, arson (burning of premises), assault
of employees on the business premises, kidnapping of
employees, employees suffering violence/being attacked on the
way to and from the business premises, misappropriation of
funds or petty theft by employees, and extortion.
While FSV has not been explicitly included in this definition
of crime, assault, kidnapping, and employees suffering vio-
lence may be as a result of FSV. It is also important to note
that FSV occurs within an environment of high levels of
crime and violence generally (The World Bank Group,
2014).
FSV in PNG thus occurs in a context of "strikingly
diverse, small fragmented social groups" (The World Bank
Group, n.d.-a) with histories of colonization and continuing
foreign interests. Moreover, PNG is a nation that encom-
passes traditional village-based life and modern urban cen-
ters, great economic inequality, and crime and violence, and
where employers may play a large role in determining
employees'well-being. It should be noted, however, that lev-
els of heterogeneity, power, and inequality characterize all
societies worldwide. The intent of describing the specifici-
ties of some of the trajectories of power in PNG is not to
single out PNG as more troubled than other societies but to
understand the particularities of context.
Defining FSV in PNG
In this article, the term FSV refers to family violence--which
is also referred to interchangeably as domestic violence in
PNG (PNG DoH, 2013)--and sexual violence. The PNG
Family Protection Act (FPA; 2013) stipulates that DV is any
act, or series of acts, or threats to commit these acts, of
assault, psychological abuse, sexual abuse, stalking, indecent
or offensive behavior, or property damage, committed by a
family member against another family member. The Act
defines family broadly to include spouses, children, parents,
grandparents, siblings, and "any other person who is treated
by the spouses as a family member" (FPA, 2013, p. 2). This
definition of family is wider than definitions of family in
Western non-Indigenous contexts and includes polygamous
relationships and people who cohabit but may not be related,
and as such it is important that Western researchers and prac-
titioners not assume that their own definitions of family are
universally relevant.
SV is defined by the World Health Organization as
any act in which one person in a power relationship uses force,
coercion or psychological intimidation to force another to carry
out a sexual act against her or his will or participate in unwanted
sexual relations from which the offender obtains gratification.
Abusive sexual contact occurs in a variety of situations,
including within marriage, on dates, at work, in school and in
families (such as incest). Other manifestations include undesired
touching, the oral, anal or vaginal penetration of a penis or
objects and obligatory exposure to pornographic material. (Fulu
et al., 2013, p. 107)
Both the PNG Family Protection Act (2013) and the defi-
nition provided by Fulu et al. (2013) for the World Health
Organization recognize that women, men, and children can
perpetrate and/or be victims of DV or SV. DV is differenti-
ated from SV, in that DV encompasses a broader range of
violent acts and may only be perpetrated by someone who is
recognized to be a family member, whereas SV refers to only
violence of a sexual nature and may be perpetrated by those
outside the family as well as those within the family. Fuluw
et al.'s definition succinctly encapsulates the main features
of SV, including the use of coercion and psychological intim-
idation, and resonates with understandings of DV that include
violence of an emotional and psychological nature.
What Is the Prevalence of FSV in PNG?
While there are no comprehensive data on the prevalence of
FSV in PNG (Eves, 2006), there is general agreement based
on available data that prevalence rates are unacceptably high
(Macintyre, 2012). The Special Rapporteur on Violence
Against Women (SRVAW; 2013) reported that "violence
against women in the family is widespread, pervasive and
often tolerated" (p. 5), and found that the last official preva-
lence data from the 1980s remain relevant with approxi-
mately two in three married women experiencing violence
perpetrated by their husbands. However, it is unclear from
this report whether polygamy is explicitly considered or
whether the data only refer to VAW in monogamous
relationships.
The SRVAW (2013) also stated that rape and sexual assault
had reached "epidemic levels" (p. 7), and Médecins Sans
Frontières (MSF; n.d.) reported that "an alarmingly large num-
ber of SV survivors are children . . . [with] 53% of all rape sur-
vivors in February 2014 and 65% of all rape survivors in March
[2014]" receiving treatment from MSF in their "Regional
Hameed et al. 5
Treatment and Training" supported facilities in the National
District Capital being children below the age of 18 (p. 3). There
is little data about the victimization of men, although a recent
multicountry study about men's VAW reported that 6.6% of
men who were surveyed in the Autonomous Region of
Bougainville had "experiences of sexual victimization by
another man" (Fulu et al., 2013, p. 62).
It is reasonable to suggest that care should be taken in
attempting to understand FSV in PNG based solely on preva-
lence data because this focus can only offer data on particular
subsets of FSV. For instance, the Law Reform Commission
Report (cited in SRVAW, 2013) only offers data on the preva-
lence of husbands physically assaulting their wives and does
not offer information about FSV perpetrated by family mem-
bers who are not husbands against other family members
who are not wives, or about nonfamily members perpetrating
SV. Prevalence of FSV in PNG may currently be underesti-
mated, as the data do not capture all manifestations of FSV.
Arguably, this may suggest that FSV is underestimated for
similar reasons in other countries.
Moreover, there are regional variations in the incidence of
FSV (Eves, 2006), and data from particular regions should
not be generalized to the population of PNG. For example,
the previously quoted prevalence data of men's experience of
sexual victimization by another man from the Autonomous
Region of Bougainville should not be generalized because,
unlike other regions in PNG, the Autonomous Region of
Bougainville was the site of "lengthy armed conflict from
1988 to 1998" (Fulu et al., 2014).
For these reasons, it is widely agreed that there is a need
for more comprehensive data collection on the prevalence of
FSV in PNG (Bradley cited in Lewis, 2012; Chandler, 2014;
MSF, n.d.). It is equally important that future studies ascer-
tain the prevalence of all types of FSV and not only collect
data on the prevalence of men's VAW in heterosexual inti-
mate relationships, as is common internationally. For exam-
ple, the Model Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) only
asks men and women their opinion about possible justifica-
tions for husbands physically assaulting wives, but not about
other forms of FSV (DHS, 2014a, Question 618; DHS,
2014b, Question 932). Limiting the data collection excludes
some forms of violence, as well as the lived experiences of
some individuals from scrutiny. This allows for narrow defi-
nitions to shape our understanding of FSV which do not truly
reflect the actual incidence and patterns of violence in the
PNG context.
FSV in PNG--The Literature to Date
There is a high level of acceptance of FSV in PNG with gen-
dered violence being viewed "as a customary, collective
practice in PNG . . . and as normal" (Jolly, 2012a, p. 3). There
is extensive literature on the reasons for the acceptability of
violence that canvases the roles of and tensions between tra-
ditional cultures and modernity in creating an environment
where FSV is acceptable (Morley, 1994). There is also wide
acknowledgment of the many failures and further harms
caused by the police, judiciary, the church, and large-scale
awareness raising programs in responding to FSV (Chandler,
2014). In addition, the role of men perpetuating FSV against
women is given a great deal of consideration, but there is
limited attention to men who are victims of FSV or women
who are victims of other women's violence.
The high acceptability of FSV in PNG and in particular
GBV has been correlated with the perception by members of
the community that some violence is justifiable (Macintyre,
2012). Macintyre (2012) stated, "Both men and women reg-
ularly explained their refusal to intervene in cases of DV
because the man "must have a reason" (p. 253). Reasons pro-
vided with the intention of justifying husbands' violence
against wives include that it is "corrective," "educational,"
"informative," or "for teaching a lesson" (Bradley as quoted
by Eves, 2006, p. 24), and it is based on a wife's provocation
(Eves, 2006, p. 24).
The roots of justifications of violence have been traced by
various authors to traditional cultures, modernizing impera-
tives, or the interplay of both factors (Morley, 1994).
Traditional cultural practices of bride price, polygamy, sor-
cery, and witchcraft have been interrogated by researchers to
reveal how violence is used to constrain men and women
into socially ascribed roles as well as to police the transgres-
sion of those roles. Modernity--including colonization, the
introduction of Christianity, and the market state--has been
critiqued to expose patriarchal control and the use of vio-
lence to impose control (see, for example, Gibbs, 2012, on
sorcery; Hermkens, 2012, on Christianity; and Zimmer-
Tamakoshi, 2012, on the changing roles of marriage in PNG
societies). The continuum of control from traditional cultures
to patriarchal modernity has also been scrutinized with Jolly
(2012b) arguing that
it is a complete dead end to blame either indigenous "culture" or
the devastating dispossession and emasculating effects of
colonialism for such contemporary configurations of gender
violence . . . [and that traditional customs experienced] over
generations and the violence of colonial possession of the land
and gendered violence against its peoples, including the
capitalist commodification of women's bodies" [need to be
simultaneously accounted for]. (p. xxxiii)
Responses to FSV in PNG have also been extensively cri-
tiqued with wide acknowledgment that current supports
available to victims of FSV are inadequate and often harm-
ful. Lewis (2012) stated that "police in PNG are known to
sexually harass and rape those reporting sexual assault"
(p. 12), and Eves (2006) reported that "women are ill-served
at all levels of the male dominated law and justice sector"
(p. 12). Macintyre (2012) found that traditional restorative
justice provided through village courts is ineffective in
applying sanctions to perpetrators of FSV as sanctions may
6 SAGE Open
be seen as socially disruptive, yet justice from statutory
courts is often no better as the men who preside in these
courts are also products of the male-dominated cultures of
PNG. In addition, responses offered by the Church to FSV in
PNG have been critiqued with Hermkens (2012) arguing that
the "cult of Mary" and the doctrine of submission propagated
by some churches in response to FSV instruct women to bear
violence stoically just as Mary, the Mother of Christ, bore
hardships in her own life.
Awareness raising programs such as the use of posters and
theater groups to raise community awareness about social
issues have also been found to be ineffective as they often
reinforce gendered stereotypes (Jolly, 2012a). Moreover,
violent backlashes against women have been reported after
the implementation of such programs leading Macintyre
(2012), to suggest that antiviolence awareness programs that
do not address the economic dependence of women are
unlikely to succeed.
Consistent with the research already presented, it is appar-
ent that the primary focus of FSV research in PNG is on men's
VAW. While select researchers acknowledge that boys and
men are victims of violence too (Eves, 2006; Jolly, 2012a;
McPherson, 2012; Zimmer-Tamakoshi, 2012), there is little or
no comment as to the reasons for this violence unless it per-
tains to understanding VAW or children. Women's violence is
also left unexplored other than as a rationale for men's VAW in
certain circumstances or in relation to the policing of gendered
roles. Research which emphasizes patriarchal power struc-
tures at the cost of all other trajectories of power consign
women to a role of abject subjection and does not recognize
that women are a heterogeneous group with desires that may
not be in solidarity with all other women. Literature that only
focuses on men's VAW may also fail to recognize violence
perpetrated against men and women for reasons other than the
perpetuation of patriarchy.
The key themes emerging from the literature on FSV in
PNG to date--the high acceptability of certain forms of FSV
in PNG; the often inadequate supports offered to victims of
FSV in PNG; and the limited research about FSV perpetrated
by women or against men--provide context for the project
under discussion. The following section describes the method
used in undertaking the project.
Method
The project was jointly undertaken by researchers from the
GVRN at the UNSW in Australia and researchers from the
Pacific Adventist University located in Port Moresby, PNG,
in partnership with the IFC and BCFW. The Workplace
Strategies--Papua New Guinea project (Ethics Approval
24.14) was conducted between September and December
2014 and consisted of (a) a good practice review of work-
place strategies that address the effects of FSV on work-
places (Hameed, 2014a) and (b) participatory action research
undertaken with FSV advocates and service providers, and
businesses and their employees in PNG (Hameed, 2014b) to
develop a Model Policy for workplace response to FSV in
PNG. The following discussion explores the perceptions of
research participants on the applicability of the identified
international good practice workplace strategies for work-
places in PNG context. The discussion does not present the
PNG project in its entirety but focuses only on key learnings.
The methodology used for the good practice review and the
participatory action research is briefly outlined below.1
Good Practice Review
The good practice review involved the identification of key
components in current workplace strategies developed by 20
organizations in six countries (Australia, Canada, Fiji, Ireland,
PNG, and the United States), which address the effects of FSV
or a subset of FSV (DV, SV, IPV, and VAW) on the workplace.
In this review, workplace strategies presented in this literature
were initially assessed against the SAHSAW (n.d.-b) seven
key principles, which were proposed by the SAHSAW project
as essential for workplace strategies to be effective. It should
be noted that the SAHSAW project focused solely on DV as
opposed to the broader area of FSV identified as important to
the PNG context. Despite this limitation, the SAHSAW prin-
ciples may apply equally to FSV. The seven principles recom-
mended by SAHSAW are as follows:
1. Dedicated additional paid leave for employees expe-
riencing family and domestic violence (FDV) or DV;
2. Confidentiality of employee details must be assured
and respected;
3. Workplace safety planning strategies to ensure pro-
tection of employees should be developed and clearly
understood by the parties concerned;
4. The agreement should provide for referral of employ-
ees to appropriate FDV or DV support services;
5. Provision of appropriate training and paid time off
work for agreed roles for nominated contact persons
(including union delegates of health and safety repre-
sentatives, if necessary);
6. Employees entitled to FDV and DV leave should also
be able to access flexible work arrangements where
appropriate; and
7. Employees must be protected against adverse action
or discrimination on the basis of their disclosure of,
experience of, or perceived experience of FDV and
DV.
For the good practice review, any additional workplace
strategies were then identified from the reports of the proj-
ects in the six countries as previously listed. In total, 26 strat-
egies were identified as "issues for deliberation" in the
review. It should be noted that workplace strategies reviewed
in PNG--the National Public Service Gender Equity and
Social Inclusion Policy (Department of Personnel
Hameed et al. 7
Management, n.d.) and the Toolkit (Department of Personnel
Management, 2013)--were at a nascent stage and only fore-
shadowed implementation. Also, at the time of the review,
Fijian workplace strategies (Fiji Women's Crisis Centre,
2013) had not yet been fully developed. An important point
for consideration is that strategies from both the earlier PNG
and Fijian responses borrowed from international, and pre-
dominantly Australian, approaches meaning that the particu-
lar context of a developing country may not be well reflected.
This article aims to address this gap in workplace strategies
by considering the specificities of the context in PNG.
Participatory Action Research
The participatory action research project undertaken in PNG
in 2014 consisted of five semistructured key informant inter-
views with personnel from organizations providing advocacy
or direct services to victims and survivors of FSV and three
focus groups involving employers, female employees, and
male employees, respectively. All participants were invited to
participate via the existing BCFW networks. Key informants
were interviewed to ascertain the availability, accessibility,
and responsiveness of services and advocacy (current or
planned) for victims and survivors of FSV. The objective of
the three focus groups was to ascertain both employer and
employee views on how FSV can affect the employees and the
organization generally and to gather their perceptions of what
would constitute appropriate workplace responses. While this
was a small-scale project in only one part of PNG, the findings
nonetheless provide insights for workplace responses in a
PNG context and indicate areas for further study.
Consistent with participatory action research, the need for
the research emanated from the participants themselves and
in particular from select businesses who initiated and devel-
oped the project brief with the BCFW and IFC. The research
methodology was driven by a commitment to value local
knowledge, culture, resources, skills, and process, and work
in solidarity with the community (Ife, 2013). The choice of a
participatory action research framework ensured that PNG
participants were given the opportunity to frame their own
understanding of the project brief and to actively participate
in the development of their own responses to FSV and the
workplace. In a collaborative process, research participants,
researchers, and the funder have collectively produced
research outcomes such as the Good Practice Review, a
Participatory Action Research Report, and a Model FSV
Workplace Policy. These outputs form the basis of a planned
implementation of the model workplace FSV policy with
selected PNG businesses in 2015 alongside further research
on the effects of FSV on the workplace in PNG.
Results and Discussion
The FSV and Workplace Strategies--Papua New Guinea
project found that current workplace strategies cited as good
practice in other countries do not sufficiently allow for the
specificities of FSV in PNG as most of these strategies are
focused on men's VAW in intimate partner relationships. In
particular, PNG participants had a wider view of what con-
stitutes FSV as well as who may perpetrate and be victim-
ized by FSV than envisaged in workplace strategies
developed in other contexts. Participants also raised issues
about the complexity of responding to FSV in PNG and
desired a more granular response to FSV than suggested in
the workplace strategies from other contexts. The following
discussion explores three key issues necessary for a more
complete understanding of what constitutes good practice
responses in the PNG context: (a) broadening definitions of
what constitutes FSV, (b) challenging current perceptions of
who may perpetrate and who may be victimized by FSV,
and (c) identifying the particular complexities of responding
to FSV in PNG.
Broadening Definitions of What Constitutes FSV
Discussions about what constitutes FSV were underpinned
by an explicit acknowledgment of the high rates of violence
and crime in PNG. In both interviews and focus groups, par-
ticipants identified a broader range of behaviors and rela-
tional processes which they believed constituted FSV than
the existing definitions of DV or SV proposed in previous
projects in predominantly Western contexts. Participants uni-
versally identified DV and SV as constituting FSV and also
included various forms of bullying in the workplace. Many
participants gave examples of swearing at another person in
the workplace, an act which would not constitute DV under
the Family Protection Act PNG (2013) nor constitute SV
under Fulu's (2013) definition, but which nonetheless was
reported as causing considerable suffering and humiliation.
Participants reported that swearing was often part of the
workplace culture and often used to "get the job done." One
participant was concerned that swearing can make staff
members uncomfortable even when it is not directed at the
employees themselves: "some people [learn to] accept it, but
others silently suffer." Many participants spoke about the
swearing of expatriate managers and highlighted the power
differentials between expatriates and national staff. Others
spoke of the socially ascribed roles for men and women in
PNG and their discomfort when these roles are breached
with one participant stating, "PNG is male dominated. There
are roles for women. I get uncomfortable if a woman uses the
`f' word in a story. I just walk away . . . This is violence
against men. Men feel violated."
While swearing at colleagues may not legally constitute
FSV, the strongly emergent theme of swearing in the work-
place in PNG is worthy of consideration. It is also notewor-
thy that participants in the research constituted acts such as
swearing as violence as it reveals their understandings of
power and who has power over whom--the import being
that such operations of power need to be addressed in FSV
8 SAGE Open
workplace strategies. In particular, participants objected to
the swearing of expatriate managers on the basis that these
managers had power over employees due to their status as
managers and due to the continuing vestiges of colonization.
Gender was also important as participants objected to women
swearing on the basis that they were transgressing their tradi-
tional roles and challenging the PNG male-dominated cul-
ture. It is apparent that participants have strong views about
the appropriate operations of power and that workplace strat-
egies designed to address FSV and its effects on the work-
place need to engage more fully with localized notions of
power.
Currently, workplaces address misuses of power such as
bullying, sexual harassment, and FSV separately. Workplace
legislation, enterprise bargaining agreements, and policies
and procedures are separated into discrete groupings based
on the definitions of what constitutes each act of violence.
Such conceptual separation of like behaviors can be counter-
productive. For example, the one described by a female par-
ticipant--"fellow workmates whistle or say something
[vulgar or derogatory] every day"--could be equally and
separately construed as bullying, sexual harassment, or SV,
and trigger multiple responses with varying procedural
requirements and available remedies.
Arguably, collapsing workplace strategies addressing bul-
lying, sexual harassment, and FSV into a single coherent
strategy to address such violence would in the short to
medium term be legislatively impractical, industrially desta-
bilizing, and the change process would be very resource
intensive for the organizations concerned. In the first
instance, what is required is not a simple rewriting of work-
place strategies but a conceptual shift in the development of
strategies to engage with contextualized understandings of
power.
Current good practice workplace strategies do not address
the complexities of power and social structures. In PNG, in
addition to colonization and traditional gender roles, the
wantok system is also a key practice that defines social obli-
gations and relationships. For instance, participants identi-
fied that the wantok system can help or be a hindrance in
accessing support for FSV. Participants noted that victims
often turn to their wantok for assistance but that perceptions
of wantokism can hinder the willingness of victims to access
service, particularly if staff members employed by service
providers belong to the perpetrator's wantok. Participants
also stated that wantokism can affect the response to FSV
with one participant stating, "sometimes the mentality of
police when wantok is involved is--we don't want to know,
or sort it out outside." Further research is required on the
details of how the wantok system can be a support or a pos-
sible barrier to access in responding to FSV.
The following discussion further unpacks participants'
views on the power dynamics of the perpetration of FSV as
well as challenging usual perceptions of whom may be con-
sidered to be a victim.
Challenging current perceptions of who may
perpetrate and who may be victimized by FSV
Participants' perceptions of who may perpetrate and who
may be victimized by FSV challenged usual assumptions
about the gender of perpetrators and victims. Participants
identified that both men and women may perpetrate FSV and
that while they reported a pronounced gender asymmetry by
suggesting that women and children are predominantly the
victims of FSV, participants clearly stated that men may be
victims too. When discussing IPV participants shared that in
their experience, FSV is an issue which may include a hus-
band perpetrating violence against their wife or wives, a wife
perpetrating violence against their husband, wives perpetrat-
ing violence against other wives, and men fighting over a
woman. One participant noted that the incidence of polyga-
mous relationships in PNG was quite high and estimated that
out of the 487 cases of violence reported to their organization
between January 2014 and October 2014, it was likely that in
approximately 86 cases, the survivor of FSV was in a polyg-
amous relationship. This assessment was made on the basis
of the available service intake information, for example,
where a client had reported that the other wife had hit them.
The prevalence of violence between women within polyga-
mous relationships in PNG is important to note as workplace
responses to FSV developed in other contexts do not con-
sider polygamous relationships. Two participants stated that
in their experience, FSV is not just about gendered power
relations and that it encompasses more than IPV perpetrated
against a woman or SV against women. These same partici-
pants took issue with international agencies in PNG using the
terms gender-based violence and violence against women
interchangeably with FSV.
Participants' perceptions are a direct challenge to most
good practice workplace strategies that conceptualize DV
only and then predominantly in relation to men's VAW in
heterosexual monogamous intimate partner relationships.
Conceptualization of FSV predicated solely on select femi-
nist readings of power elevating patriarchy and gender above
all other power dynamics provides insufficient explanation
of FSV in the PNG context. Participant's views were more
consistent with a multidimensional approach to power that
recognizes multiple trajectories and intersections of power.
Based on participants' statements, it is reasonable to sug-
gest that current good practice workplace strategies fail to
conceptualize FSV adequately as they primarily focus on
men's VAW in monogamous intimate partner relationships
and most fail to recognize men as victims of violence. Given
the differing context in PNG, there is an urgent need for
research establishing the incidence of all forms of FSV, as
well as the prevalence rates of FSV which identify the vic-
tim's relationship to the perpetrator of the violence. Data
such as these would inform a more nuanced workplace
response to FSV that is more consistent with participants'
understanding and experience of FSV in the PNG context.
Hameed et al. 9
The Complexity of Responding to FSV in PNG
The assumption of a functioning state-sponsored legislative
and protective framework, and the assumption that appropri-
ate support is available to victims of FSV within their com-
munity, underpins all workplace strategies reviewed for this
project. In PNG, however, there is no such functional frame-
work, and supports are not uniformly available, if at all.
These factors reinforce the need to develop FSV workplace
strategies differently in PNG and outside of an industrial
framework as has predominated to date. This latter point
underscores the importance of modifying current good prac-
tice FSV workplace strategies to ensure that they reflect of
the local context.
The need to develop FSV workplace strategies in collaboration
with local businesses. To date, internationally workplace strat-
egies have been developed on the basis that there is a legisla-
tive framework that can provide remedies if rights and
entitlements are breached. While legislation on FSV and the
workplace does not necessarily need to precede industrial
entitlements on FSV and the workplace, industrial parties
need to have the confidence that entitlements will be upheld
through the courts if necessary. For instance, in Australia,
DV workplace entitlements for around 1.6 million employ-
ees were secured through bargaining between unions and
employers (SAHSAW, n.d.-a) prior to legislative changes to
the Fair Work Act (2013) that enshrined minimum entitle-
ments for all workers in the federal jurisdiction (SAHSAW,
n.d.-c). In Australia, researchers at UNSW, who were part of
the SAHSAW program, conducted the campaign for these
entitlements in partnership with the Australian trade union
movement.
Arguably, in PNG such a campaign would be ill conceived
as the industrial landscape is different with participants
advising researchers that enterprise bargaining coverage in
some sectors is as low as 10%. While industrial legislation
exists, few rights and entitlements can be accessed through
the courts in practice. There are barriers to accessing media-
tion and arbitration through the PNG Department of Labour
with one participant stating, "There are unsolved cases from
as far back as 2003 and 2004. Sometimes the mediator or
chairperson is not there when the mediation is scheduled."
As such collaboration with local businesses is vital in
PNG to ensure that businesses are supportive of implement-
ing FSV workplace strategies as developing entitlements
though bargaining and enforcing implementation though
industrial mechanisms is unlikely to be successful.
Furthermore, as reported by participants, because legislation
regarding FSV such as the Family Protection Act (2013) has
not been fully implemented with the regulations underpin-
ning the Act still to be finalized, the active collaboration of
businesses is necessary to provide employees with some cer-
tainty in an otherwise uncertain environment. Certainty of a
response may be particularly important in an environment
where, as reported by participants, businesses take a more
active role in employee well-being than in other countries,
including providing employees with housing, transportation
to and from the workplace, and meals at the workplace.
Direct collaboration with businesses also allows for a
more granular understanding of the possible ways in which
FSV affects the workplace and what responses might be fea-
sible at each specific workplace. Hence, the development
and implementation of FSV workplace strategies more gen-
erally may benefit from closer collaboration with businesses
in addition to existing relationships with trade unions.
Participants' experiences of responding to FSV in PNG.Partici-
pants reported that responding to FSV in PNG was a com-
plex issue as there is no guarantee that police, the courts,
medical and psychosocial services, or emergency accommo-
dation could or would respond appropriately to victims of
FSV. Furthermore, the coordination between services was
universally reported to be inadequate. Participants also
reported difficulties in sanctioning perpetrators of FSV and
advised researchers that many people found FSV to be
acceptable--particularly in certain circumstances. Clearly,
there are considerable challenges in responding to FSV in
PNG, and simply accepting good practice workplace strate-
gies from other contexts may cause further harm in this par-
ticular context if they are not modified.
Participants reported that police and the judicial system
are often not responsive to victims of FSV either because of
their lack of training, conflicting wantok relationships
between victims and perpetrators, or due to corruption,
affecting victims' ability to access police protection and to
secure interim protection orders (IPOs) to restrain the perpe-
trator from further harassing or harming the victim.
Participants advised that not all police and court staff have
the necessary paralegal skills to process IPOs; some courts
ask for "lodgment fees" to apply for IPOs even though there
are no such fees under the law, and that police often demand
"money on the side" to respond even minimally to victims of
violence. Despite this uncertain response from the police and
the courts, some FSV service providers in PNG and many
good practice workplace strategies are strongly in favor of
victims of FSV seeking IPOs. However, providing such a
recommendation to a victim of FSV may be harmful as there
is no certainty that police and courts will assist victims to
obtain an IPO and that police will provide protection if an
IPO is breached. As such, good practice FSV workplace
strategies need to be modified in PNG so that the willingness
and ability of the police and courts to respond to FSV in each
location are ascertained prior to services and businesses rec-
ommending that victims seek IPOs or protection from the
police. This recommendation may also have salience in other
communities outside PNG where police and the courts are
not willing to respond or are ineffective.
Participants reported that there are limited medical, psy-
chosocial, and emergency accommodation services in PNG
10 SAGE Open
and that they vary considerably in the quality of care pro-
vided. Without doubt, some services provide a high-quality
response, but participants suggested other providers may
cause further harms. For example, some medical services are
staffed by untrained volunteers, there is no accreditation of
counseling services in PNG, and some emergency accom-
modation services require victims of FSV to return to the
perpetrator after a 2-week respite because the services do not
have any plans to transition victims to longer term accom-
modation. In some instances, the reason why victims are
returned to violent and abusive situations is that these orga-
nizations are Christian-based organizations that do not
believe in divorce under any circumstance.
Most good practice workplace policies outside of the
PNG context are premised on the basis that employers refer
employees who are victims of FSV to appropriate support
services within the community. It is clear that this work-
place strategy is not viable in the PNG context and to refer
employees to services which do not exist or that may cause
further harm cannot be considered good practice and would
be professionally irresponsible. More generally, simply
importing strategies modeled on internationally sourced
good practice workplace strategies into PNG perpetuates
just that. Accordingly, it is reasonable to recommend that
businesses ascertain what supports are available to victims
of FSV within their given community and, where possible,
augment these supports where they can, and at the very
minimum do not overrepresent supports available lest
employees base their decisions on inaccurate advice, how-
ever well-meaning. This is a particularly relevant recom-
mendation in countries where there are no national service
standards and where service provision is lacking due to
geographic remoteness or due to sociocultural and eco-
nomic factors.
Participants reported that except in Lae (a provincial capi-
tal), there was inadequate coordination between FSV service
providers. One participant advised researchers that a client
had been "lost" when she was transferred from emergency
accommodation to the hospital to seek medical attention and
that another woman had been raped on the way to the welfare
office. All participants suggested that businesses could play
a valuable role in assisting victims to access a relevant ser-
vice. Some participants gave examples of current practices
where businesses provide safe transportation for victims of
FSV to access services. Such a role for businesses in coordi-
nating access to services has not been envisioned elsewhere
in current good practice workplace strategies. This role does
not impose any great cost to businesses and would greatly
assist victims of FSV to feel supported when accessing ser-
vices. It is also consistent with earlier discussion of the ways
in which business in PNG looks after their workers in ways
not consistent with Western concepts of employer­employee
responsibilities.
Many participants called for business to take a greater
role in addressing the behavior of employees who are
perpetrators of FSV and through counseling, disciplinary
action, and/or notifying law enforcement and other authori-
ties and raised some of the difficulties in dealing with per-
petrators in the workplace in a culture where FSV is
accepted by many and where police protection is limited.
Some participants spoke of perpetrators speaking freely
about their perpetration of violence and joking about FSV.
One participant spoke of the difficulty they faced in disci-
plining a perpetrator as the perpetrator threatened to "do
worse" to his wife if the employer took any action in an
environment where police protection is limited. This
employer felt a responsibility to protect the victim, even
though the victim was not employed by the business, and
held confidential discussions with the victim to ascertain
and respond to the victims' wishes in the matter. This case
typifies the expanded role that employers in PNG hold, in
comparison with many employers in Western contexts and
needs to inform workplace strategies in PNG.
Currently, few good practice workplace strategies in any
context have explicit mechanisms to address perpetrators in
the workplace. Some workplaces attempt to engage bystand-
ers (those who are not perpetrators or victims of violence) to
intervene in the violence by supporting the victim, but most
implicitly rely on general employment obligations to address
perpetration. Bystander approaches are unlikely to succeed
in PNG due to the high acceptability of violence. Reliance on
employment legislation is also fraught due to the inaccessi-
bility of the labor courts and the legal system generally,
which has been described previously. As such, further
research is required in PNG to assess how businesses can
best manage and/or extend disciplinary procedures to
employees who are perpetrators. This type of research may
also assist in addressing the gap in current good practice
workplace strategies, which on the whole are silent about
perpetrators in the workplace.
Conclusion
This research project in PNG on FSV and the workplace has
shown that local context is essential in developing effective
FSV workplace strategies. The research revealed that partici-
pants have a more nuanced understanding of FSV and power
than reflected in current good practice FSV workplace strate-
gies implemented elsewhere. The research has also shown
that the context in which FSV occurs in PNG is vastly differ-
ent to that contemplated in current good practice workplace
strategies. Therefore, current workplace strategies from other
contexts must be modified if they are to form good practice
in PNG. There is a need for further research in PNG with
those affected to better understand the effects of FSV on the
workplace and to develop and implement a contextualized
response. It is hoped that this research will not only assist
workplaces in PNG but that the methodology of working in
collaboration with those affected may be useful in other
contexts.
