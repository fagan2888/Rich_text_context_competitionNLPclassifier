Substance Abuse:
Research and Treatment
The impact of methamphetamine (MA) use on women
warrants attention because of its deleterious physical and
psychological effects and related social costs.1,2 Increases in
MA use over the past two decades have created an imperative
to better understand its use context, its impact on women's
health, and potential social implications in order to form a
basis for modification and development of prevention and
intervention efforts.2,3This imperative is especially important
for pregnant women, because the consequences of maternal
drug use and related life style are experienced by both the
user and the developing fetus. A study of illicit drug use over-
all found drug use among women escalates more rapidly to
addiction than does drug use among men, and women are at
greater risk for relapse than men.4 Specific to MA, women
may be at risk for more severe MA dependence compared to
men, as indicated in a study by Maxwell2 that showed women
became dependent on MA sooner than men, initiated MA
use to attempt to alleviate depression, and had higher rates of
childhood sexual abuse than men. Rawson et al5 found that
young women reported more MA use, became dependent on
MA within a shorter period of time, and suffered more adverse
effects than did young men; in addition, after controlling for
age and race, more women than men were dependent on MA
and identified MA as their primary drug of choice.
Moreover, recent research indicates MA use is associ-
ated with fetal problems and poorer birth and childhood
outcomes; for example, findings from the IDEAL study
show prenatal exposure to MA was associated with increased
physiological stress, lower arousal, and childhood neurobe-
havioral disinhibition.6,7 However, little has been published
about female MA users' reproductive histories and related
context. This study contributes to the needed knowledge base
by describing self-reported numbers of pregnancies and fetal
losses among MA-using women, and compares this sample
of women with national statistics. In addition, we examine
the association of reproductive history with drug use severity

Abstract: To better understand substance use disorder treatment needs of pregnant and parenting women who use methamphetamine (MA),
this paper describes pregnancy histories and fetal losses for women who were treated for MA use (N = 153) with reference to a national sample, and
describes their drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and mental health status. MA users reported an average of 4.6 total pregnancies and 2.1 fetal losses,
whereas women in a general population survey reported 3.2 and 1.2, respectively. Higher numbers of pregnancies and fetal losses were correlated with
specific substance abuse and mental health problems including early sexual abuse and cognitive problems. The combination of MA users' especially high
numbers of pregnancies, fetal losses, and rates of risk behaviors suggest high social and health care costs for this population. Prenatal care may provide
a vector through which women can be connected to risk reduction interventions and gender-responsive treatment services addressing substance use and
mental health needs.

and related problems, in order to identify subgroups of women
who may be at higher risk for poor health and child welfare
outcomes. Our findings provide information on the health
and treatment needs of MA-using pregnant and parenting
women, and help define the magnitude of potential health and
child welfare problems related to MA use. Results may inform
the development and refinement of gender-sensitive treatment
programs that provide services to MA-using women and their
children.
MA is now labeled a principal drug threat because of
epidemic increases in its use8; after a short period of decline
in 2005­2007, MA use has again increased in the United
States.9,10 Although MA use had long been considered a
regional (West Coast) phenomenon in the US, with dramatic
increases in that region in the mid-1990s, its use has contin-
ued to spread to other areas of the country, including rural,
urban, and suburban sections of the South and Midwest.11,12
Analysis of the treatment episode data set (TEDS) confirms
this geographical pattern, and indicates that a shift in use
from an initial concentration of predominantly white women
to an increasing proportion of Hispanic women has been
observed.13 These data show MA treatment admissions for
pregnant women rose from 8% in 1994 to 24% in 2006, lead-
ing the authors to conclude that MA is the primary substance
of abuse for which pregnant women seek care. Worldwide, as
many as 56 million individuals globally are estimated to be
users of amphetamine-type substances,14 ranking this group
of drugs (of which MA is the primary example) as second in
worldwide illicit drug use. Its use has been documented in
110 countries, with greater prevalence in East and South East
Asia, North America, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia,
and several European countries15; MA has been identified as
the primary illicit drug threat in Asia.16
Owing to MA-related behaviors such as initiation of use
during adolescence, increased sexuality, and injection use,
MA users are at increased risk for HIV, hepatitis, risky sexual
behaviors, teenage pregnancy, and potentially high rates of
pregnancy.17­21 Pregnant women dependent on MA are at risk
for multiple complications including preterm delivery, cesar-
ean delivery, and neonatal mortality.22 Beyond the potential
for contributing to negative fetal and birth outcomes, MA use
by women also contributes to high-risk environments for their
children.23,24
Self-report data from a larger study of the natural his-
tory and outcomes of treatment for MA use allow descrip-
tion of reproductive history, including pregnancy incidence
and fetal loss, reported by a diverse sample of women with a
history of MA use and treatment. This paper also compares
lifetime pregnancy rates reported by these women across eth-
nic groups and to national rates. To provide some context for
these figures, we also describe their sexual risk behaviors,
drug use history, mental health status, and the extent to which
pregnancy is reported as a reason for changing MA use or
for entering treatment. The aggregate picture of reproductive
history and its context in this MA-using sample is compelling
in its illustration of high risk and potential social cost.
Methods
Sample. Data are from the 153 female participants in a
study of the natural history of MA use and substance use dis-
order (SUD) treatment outcomes. Interviews were conducted
in 1998­2000, with clients who had been treated for MA use
in publicly funded Los Angeles County treatment programs.
The parent study selected a stratified (by gender, ethnicity,
and type of treatment [residential or outpatient]) random
sample of MA-related admission records in the California
state SUD data system (California Alcohol and Drug Data
System [CADDS], primarily from 1996, with a few in late
1995 or early 1997 to allow adequate cell sizes for underrep-
resented subgroups). These clients were invited to participate
in the study by their treatment providers. A 76% interview
rate was achieved from sampled admissions who could be
located: 350 usable interviews were obtained, 15 had incom-
plete interviews, 88 declined participation, 28 expressed inter-
est but did not schedule or complete interviews, 6 had died;
an additional 151 sampled admissions could not be located.
A comparison of data available from admission records for the
interviewed and not-interviewed subgroups showed no sig-
nificant differences in gender, education, age of first MA use,
age at sampled treatment episode admission, number of prior
treatment episodes, employment status, whether homeless,
pregnant, or under legal supervision. (Additional descriptions
on study and interview procedures and sample characteris-
tics appear in Brecht et al and von Mayrhauser et al.25,26) The
Institutional Review Board at the University of California,
Los Angeles approved this study, and participants provided
written informed consent.
Instrument. Face-to-face interviews were conducted
using the Natural History Interview (NHI) protocol, which
has over 30 years of use in substance abuse research with
acceptable levels of reliability.27­29 The NHI assesses socio-
demographic and other background characteristics; substance
use, sexual risk, and criminal behaviors; and physical and
mental health characteristics. A timeline followback segment
collects detailed life history of substance use, treatment utili-
zation, criminal behavior, and legal status.
Measures. The NHI provided self-report data for this
analysis from questions including total number of pregnan-
cies, number that ended in live births, number that terminated
without a live birth (labeled "fetal loss" in this paper), and the
number that terminated before six months, and at or after six
months. Respondents were not asked to distinguish between
induced abortion and other fetal loss. Women were also asked
whether any of their biological children had a physical, men-
tal, or learning disability (however, specific disabilities were
not assessed). To keep interviews at a feasible length, partici-
pants were asked for additional detail on up to five of their
children; thus more detailed data were available for a total of
Pregnancy among methamphetamine-using women

362 children. As this was not a clinical study, women were
not asked detailed questions about each pregnancy; thus data
represent a general picture of occurrences during a life period
that involved MA use. Sexual risk items included number of
partners and use of condoms in the 30 days preceding the
interview. Items from the timeline followback segment pro-
vided data on reasons for changes in MA use patterns and for
treatment entry.
Substance use behaviors were assessed, including past
month use of MA, any past regular use of crack/cocaine (cat-
egorized as no/yes), age of MA initiation, and age of initiation
of regular MA use. To further assess drug use severity, an over-
all poly-drug indicator was calculated, indicating the num-
ber of types of drugs ever used (from cocaine, crack, ecstasy,
phencyclidine, inhalants, hallucinogens, opiates including
heroin, tranquilizers, and downers). A composite MA prob-
lem score (possible range 0­7) was calculated to indicate the
number of physical/mental health problems women reported
as resulting from their MA use (ie, weight loss, sleeplessness,
paranoia, hallucinations, dental problems, skin problems, and
high blood pressure).
Regarding mental health status, respondents reported
whether they had experienced specific mental health problems
that were not a direct result of drug or alcohol use prior to
their treatment episode for sampling or in the past 30 days,
including serious depression or anxiety that lasted two or more
weeks, trouble concentrating/understanding/remembering
(ie, cognitive problems) that lasted two or more weeks, and
trouble controlling violent behavior. Respondents were also
asked whether they ever seriously considered committing
suicide, and those who did were asked whether they ever
attempted suicide. Lastly, respondents were asked whether
they experienced physical abuse (ie, having been hit or beaten
so hard that you had cuts or bruises, had to stay in bed, or had
to see the doctor) and sexual abuse (ie, forced or pressured to
do any sexual acts against your will), and how many times this
happened before age 15 (labeled "early physical abuse" and
"early sexual abuse" in this paper).
Analysis. Analyses include percentages or means as
appropriate of distributional characteristics. Ethnic subgroup
comparisons were made using ANOVA. Comparisons were
made against national figures using one-sample t-tests or
goodness-of-fit chi square.30 National data used for compari-
son purposes are from the National Center for Health Statis-
tics.31 Comparison data were selected for 1995 as representative
of the broader time frame covered by the study participants'
MA use and reproductive histories. Statistics from this report
used for comparison are estimated lifetime pregnancy and live
birth rates; the difference between these two indicate rate of
pregnancies not resulting in a live birth (including induced
abortions and other fetal loss).
To examine the association of sexual risk behaviors,
drug use, and mental health status with pregnancy outcomes
(total number of pregnancies and pregnancies that did and
did not end in live birth), Pearson correlation analyses were
conducted for continuous variables and independent sam-
ples t-tests were conducted for categorical variables. Unless
otherwise indicated, the significance level (two-tailed) was
set at P , 0.05.
Results
Sample description. This diverse sample of 153 women
was 11% African-American, 29% Hispanic, 55% non-Hispanic
white, and 5% multiracial or other ethnicity. The group was
split almost equally into three education categories: less than
high school (31%), high school graduate (35%), and at least
some college (33%). A wide range of income was represented
($0­289,000); however, the median was $16,000. Of these
women, 88% have children. At the time of the interview, 40%
had never been married and 19% were married. The average
age at the time of the interview was 31.7 years (range 18­51).
The average age of first MA use was 18.5 years and of regular
MA use was 20.0 years. About one-third (32%) had used one
or more illicit drugs during the month preceding the inter-
view; 16% had used MA. Sixty-nine percent were current
smokers at the time of interview.
Pregnancies, fetal losses, births. Among the 151 of the
women who reported pregnancy data, there were a total of 697
pregnancies over their reported lifetimes, 398 (56%) of which
resulted in live births; 285 (41%) were lost before six months,
and 14 (2%) were late-term losses. (Note that two women did
not answer the items relating to pregnancy.)
The sample of 153 women reported a total of 402 children,
including 8 sets of twins; 4 children had died. The mother's age
at the child's birth (for the set of 362 children with detailed
data) ranged from 14 to 40, with an average of 23.5 years.
Seventy-nine percent of these children were born after the
mothers had initiated MA use. Forty percent of these children
were born when mothers were 20­24, a high MA-use period
(considering the average age of regular MA use of 20 and an
additional average of 7.3 years until first treatment). Among
women with children in this sample, 31% reported having a
child with a physical, mental, and/or learning disability.
Comparison of pregnancies and fetal losses to national
statistics. While 1995 national statistics show an overall
lifetime pregnancy rate of 3.2 per woman,31 the MA sample
showed a significantly higher (t = 4.63, df = 150, P , 0.001)
overall average of 4.6 even though 82% of the study sample
were still under age 40 and thus may not have completed
their fertility period. In this MA sample, Hispanics and non-
Hispanic whites had somewhat similar pregnancy rates of 4.4
and 3.9, respectively, while African-Americans had a rate of
8.2 (F = 10.04, df = 2,141, P , 0.001). These figures con-
trast sharply with national figures for non-Hispanic whites
(MA sample 3.9 vs. national average 2.7, t = 3.89, df = 83,
P , 0.001) and African-Americans (MA sample 8.2 vs.
national average 4.6, t = 2.03, df = 16, P = 0.029), while no
significant difference was seen for Hispanics (MA sample 4.4
Brecht and Herbeck

vs. national average 4.6). The MA sample also had higher than
usual average number of pregnancies that ended without a live
birth: 2.1 per woman vs. a national lifetime average of 1.2
(t = 3.40, df = 150, P , 0.001). Results showed ethnic differ-
ences (F = 6.68, df = 2,141, P = 0.002) with African-Ameri-
cans having the highest rate, of 4.1 per woman, of pregnancies
ending without a live birth; Hispanic (1.3) and non-Hispanic
white (1.9) rates were each significantly lower than that of
African-Americans. Comparison to national figures shows
a significantly higher average number of losses for non-
Hispanic whites (MA sample 1.9 vs. national average 0.9;
t = 2.39, df = 83, P = 0.009). A higher (but not significantly)
average also resulted for African-Americans (MA sample 4.1
vs. national average 2.4; t = 0.87, df = 16, P = 0.200); note that
this is a small subgroup in the MA sample with large vari-
ability for this variable. Figure 1 shows the average number of
pregnancies per woman for each ethnic group, as well as the
average per woman of pregnancies that ended without a live
birth. While the fetal loss average per woman differs among
ethnic groups, the overall percentages of fetal loss of total
pregnancies show a slightly different picture: similar at 50%
for African-Americans and 49% for non-Hispanic whites, and
the lowest for Hispanics at 28%. In our sample overall, no sig-
nificant differences were seen in pregnancy rates, fetal losses,
or live births by MA users' educational level or income level.
Sexual risk behaviors and reasons for changing MA
use. Although these women had all been admitted to SUD
treatment at least once, there were still high levels of sexual
risk behaviors at the time of the interview. Of the two-thirds
of the women who were sexually active in the month preceding
the interview, only 5% reported always using a condom dur-
ing this month. Condom use varied by age group and marital

status: among those married, 13% of those 18­29 years of age
and 0% of those 30 years or older reported always using a con-
dom; among those not married, 8% of those 18­29 years, 3%
of those 30­39, and 0% of those 40 and older reported always
using a condom. Of the 57 women who reported drug use and/
or alcohol intoxication during the month preceding the inter-
view, 28% reported combining substance use with sex at least
half the time.
Only 44% of women mentioned pregnancy as a reason
for changing their pattern of MA use. Fewer women reported
entering SUD treatment because of a pregnancy: of the 143
women who been pregnant, 84% said that pregnancy had no
effect on their decisions to enter treatment, 15% said that it
encouraged them to enter treatment, and 1% to stay out. All
but three women resumed or increased MA use after at least
one of their pregnancies, with about one-third of explanations
of relapse being associated with pregnancy, including to "lose
baby fat," to "have energy for kids," because "I wasn't preg-
nant anymore," and "I felt so bad about my baby being taken
away."
Anecdotal evidence from a supplemental in-depth quali-
tative interview exemplifies one intersection of MA use, preg-
nancy, and treatment entry. For example, one woman reported
20 pregnancies, 17 of which ended with abortion: with her
first pregnancy at age 14, she stopped using all substances and
"the baby was ok"; with the two other pregnancies she car-
ried to term, she "used everything" until the last two months.
She indicated abstaining from MA for brief periods before her
health care visits during pregnancy because she did not want
her substance abuse detected.

whether specific drug use and mental health problems were
reported are shown in Table 1. Having more sexual partners
was associated with more fetal losses but fewer live births
(Table 2). However, more sexual partners was also associated
with greater drug use severity as indicated by significant cor-
relations with poly-drug use (r = 0.22) and number of MA-
related problems (r = 0.19; results not shown in table). Likewise,
a higher number of fetal losses was associated with greater

drug use severity; in contrast, more live births were associated
with lower drug use severity. Regarding early sexual abuse,
greater severity was associated with more total pregnancies,
and correlations were in the same direction for number of live
births (P = 0.068) and number of fetal losses (P = 0.194).
Discussion
In this sample of women with MA-use histories, we see a
high average number of pregnancies per woman overall, 44%
higher than the national figure, and specifically for African-
Americans and non-Hispanic whites. We also see higher
average numbers of pregnancies that terminated without a live
birth. Furthermore, there was a high rate of late-term fetal
loss (2% of pregnancies, representing 4.8% of those pregnan-
cies that ended without a live birth). These high rates are cause
for concern, as we see epidemic spread of MA use to previ-
ously low-prevalence areas of the US.11,12
The concurrence of sexual risk-taking behaviors and high
frequencies of pregnancies is of particular interest: risk behav-
iors, including the low rate of condom use, may not only expli-
cate the high number of pregnancies but also further endanger
the health of those women and fetuses. In a US national sample
of adult women, rates of condom use during the past 10 vagi-
nal intercourse events and during the most recent intercourse
event were 18.4 and 21.8%, respectively.32 These rates varied
by age and relationship status, with older women and those
with a relationship partner (ie, spouse, partner, boyfriend,
significant other or dating partner) having lower rates of con-
dom use than younger women and those with casual partners;
among women with relationship partners, rates ranged from
20.0% for younger women (age 18­24) to 10.9% for older
women (age 40­49); among women with casual partners, rates
ranged from 41.5% for younger women (age 25­29) to 19.8%
for older women (age 40­49). While these rates are lower than
US national goals for increasing condom use,33 they are mark-
edly higher than the overall rate of 5% observed in our study
and within marital status and age categories.
Combining drug use with pregnancy suggests a public
health problem with potentially high social and health care
costs. Indeed, we note that 31% of women in this sample with
child(ren) report that they have children with physical, men-
tal, and/or learning disabilities. Furthermore, results show
continuing use of illicit drugs by many of the women; and
more than two-thirds were smokers at the time of interview.
Thus, the continuation of risk-taking behaviors implies the
persistence of social and health care costs.
As pregnancy offers a specific motivation to discontinue
drug use and an avenue for interaction between MA-using
women and health services, prenatal care should afford an
opportunity to identify SUD treatment and risk reduction
needs and connect women to appropriate interventions. Par-
ticipation in SUD treatment has been shown to be effective in
reducing substance use in general,34­37 and results are begin-
ning to accumulate that treatment also has positive outcomes
for MA users.38­41 Moreover, among pregnant substance users
who screened positive for any of several substances including
amphetamines, SUD treatment integrated with prenatal vis-
its has been associated with a positive effect on both mater-
nal and newborn health.42 While not specific to MA users,
SUD treatment during pregnancy has been shown to improve
birth outcomes among heroin and cocaine users.43 Programs
designed specifically for women have shown positive out-
comes, particularly in improving psychological factors.44
However, results indicate the complexity of the relation-
ship among MA use, pregnancy, and SUD treatment entry.
As some pregnant women decreased or paused MA use but
few entered SUD treatment because of pregnancy, results sug-
gest that pregnant women may face barriers to SUD treat-
ment entry. For example, some report decreasing rather than
completely refraining from use, suggesting that treatment
requirements of abstinence may impede treatment entry. Also,
relatively few women were motivated to enter treatment due
to pregnancy. This appears consistent with earlier work show-
ing low rates of perceived need for treatment among pregnant
arrestees, similar to non-pregnant women arrestees.45 The
anecdote described above indicates that women may fear
reporting MA use to medical authorities, which may be a major
barrier to substance abuse treatment access. Future research
must explore barriers to treatment so that intervention strate-
gies can be designed accordingly. Treatment must also account

for the concurrence of giving birth and increasing drug use;
shortly following birth, women appear to be at a high risk for
relapse, consequently, this may be an optimal time to imple-
ment relapse prevention plans and interventions. Furthermore,
research must examine reasons why more women do not alter
MA use behaviors during pregnancy. Of particular interest
may be women's knowledge of MA's effect on fetuses.
Our findings also indicate women who had more severe
substance abuse problems, used crack/cocaine, had more
sexual partners, and had cognitive and/or anxiety problems
suffered a greater number of fetal losses than women with-
out these problems. Whether fetal losses were the result of
spontaneous or induced abortions (not distinguished in this
study), the women in this sample may have experienced sub-
stantial adverse physical and/or psychological consequences
prior to, or due to these losses. Studies have shown that preg-
nancy loss per se, whether abortion or miscarriage, increases
the risk of a range of substance use disorders and psychiat-
ric problems.46­48 Thus, efforts to assist women in accessing
reproductive health care resources may reduce unintended
pregnancies and facilitate improved health outcomes. To
reduce unintended pregnancy, McEneaney and Hong49
suggest health care professionals foster a supportive, non-
judging environment to address reproductive health issues,
provide counseling about common misconceptions about
contraception, and create an individualized birth control
plan. This approach may be especially important for MA-
using women, who may also benefit from on-going follow-
up and assistance accessing emergency contraception (eg,
"morning after pill") if needed; a study by Trussell et al50
indicates emergency contraception is effective whether pro-
vided when the emergency arises or in advance to be used as
needed, and can reduce the considerable medical and social
costs of unintended pregnancies.
Similar to findings on fetal loss, having a greater number
of children was associated with specific mental health prob-
lems. Women who had more live births were more likely to
report serious depression prior to substance abuse treatment
and had trouble controlling violent behavior. They were also
somewhat more likely to have experienced more severe early
sexual abuse than women with fewer live births. Previous
studies indicate women with children have a need for compre-
hensive, enhanced substance abuse treatment programs that
respond to the range of social service needs of women, and
provide services including outreach and integrated care, ie,
services that include on-site child-related services with addic-
tion services.51,52 Our findings suggest women with more chil-
dren may have an even greater need than women with fewer
children for mental health care services addressing sexual
abuse/trauma, violence, and depression.
Interpretation and generalization of study results must
consider limitations including: (1) population specificity of
MA-using women who have presented for SUD treatment;
(2) geographic limitation to one large metropolitan county in
the US; however, the population magnitude and ethnic and
socio-demographic diversity of the target geographic area sup-
ports the relevance of results and the sample itself is diverse
and representative of the county's treatment population; (3)
inability to link MA use to specific pregnancy outcomes, since
the study did not collect clinical records that would allow
direct association of specific individual pregnancy character-
istics and birth outcomes; (4) inability to distinguish reason
for fetal loss from data collected in this study. Future research
should be undertaken to provide additional detail on specific
pregnancies, fetal losses, risk behaviors, and temporal linkage
to substance use patterns.
This study is also limited in that the data were collected
in 1998­2000 with reference to an index treatment episode
in 1996; accordingly the women in our sample participated in
substance abuse and medical treatments that may have
changed or improved in recent years. However, treatment for
MA use has remained psychosocial in nature; and while some
approaches have been specialized to MA users with improved
outcomes, treatment outcomes across the broad range of sub-
stance use treatment systems have shown less change.37,53
Despite these limitations, this study provides a useful general
picture of MA-using women who come in contact with the
substance use treatment system, a picture not widely available
in the literature. This contact with treatment services remains
an important vector to link them with appropriate medi-
cal, mental health, and other services. Studies indicate MA
use has increased overall8,9 and specifically among pregnant
women, and the adverse effects of MA on women's overall
health and on the health and welfare of their children are not
only continuing but may be worsening in more recent years.13
For example, the number of women MA users admitted to
treatment for substance abuse increased nearly six-fold from
1996 to 201154; and current reports indicate an upswing in MA
prevalence indicators in many areas of the US in 2012­2013.55
Terplan et al13further report that MA has been the primary
drug of abuse among pregnant women admitted to drug treat-
ment since 2003, and MA-related treatment admissions are
rising among pregnant women, as are accompanying burdens
of medical and social comorbidities.
Results show compelling differences between this sample
of women treated for MA use from national statistics, and as
such support the need for additional attention to prevention
and treatment efforts. Men and women differ markedly with
regard to their use of, and responses to MA,56 and addressing
the specific needs of women may improve gender-responsive
treatment strategies and health and welfare outcomes for
women and their children.
