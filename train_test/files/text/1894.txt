Background: Mercury amalgam dental restorations have been used by dentists since the mid 19th century
and issues on safety continue to be periodically debated within the scientific and public health
communities. Previous studies have reported a positive association between urine mercury levels and the
number of dental amalgams, but this relation has never been described in a nationally representative
sample in the United States.
Aims and Methods: Using household interview, dietary interview, dental examination, and laboratory
data from the 1999­2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the association
between mercury concentrations and dental restorations was examined in US women of reproductive age.
Results: In women of childbearing age, approximately 13% of all posterior dental surfaces were restored
with amalgams and the average urinary mercury level in women was low (1.34 mg/l). It is estimated that
an increase of 1.8 mg/l in the log transformed values for mercury in urine would occur for each 10 dental
surfaces restored with amalgam.
Conclusions: Although the findings do not address the important issues of adverse health effects at low
thresholds of mercury exposure, they do provide important reference data that should contribute
significantly to the ongoing scientific and public health policy debate on the use of dental amalgams in the
USA.
During the previous decade, there have been significant
efforts by the federal government and the dental
profession to review and disseminate the existing state
of knowledge regarding mercury amalgam dental restoration
safety. In 1993, the US Public Health Service issued an expert
panel summary report concluding that mercury amalgam
was a safe and effective dental restorative material.1 2 The
American Dental Association's Council on Scientific Affairs
comprehensive review in 1998 reached a similar conclusion.3
Nevertheless, the safety of mercury amalgams remains a
concern and a topic of numerous recent scientific publica-
tions. Because of continuing concerns, the Food and Drug
Administration issued a request for information regarding
dental amalgam safety in 2003.4
Although mercury has serious health effects at high
exposure, debate continues regarding adverse health effects
at low levels of mercury exposure from fish and dental
amalgams.5 The existing epidemiological literature on the
health effects related to low levels of elemental and inorganic
mercury exposure should be considered incomplete. Many
studies have been small, cross-sectional convenience sam-
ples, or used relatively short follow up times. There is also the
technical limitation that urinary mercury values reflect a
combination of both recent exposure and body burden, and
the two are imperfectly correlated. The World Health
Organisation has called for chronic mercury exposure studies
that would be useful in defining a threshold of biological
effects below the level of 25 mg/l in urine, and that are not
limited by insufficient statistical power, or inconsistent
measures of exposure or outcome.6 To address some of these
issues, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial
Research began funding two children's amalgam trials in
1996. Both two-arm trials are to be conducted over a seven
year period on elementary aged children living in the
northeastern United States and Portugal.
Mercury exists in several oxidation states: metallic or
elemental mercury (Hg0), inorganic mercury (IHg: including
Hg+ (mercurous salts) and Hg++ (mercuric salts)), and
organic mercury (principally methylmercury (MeHg), but
also ethyl-, phenylmercury, and others). Mercury absorption
and relative toxicity depend on its chemical form. All forms of
mercury are neurotoxic depending on dose, but MeHg has the
greatest potential neurotoxicity, with Hg++ less so. Both Hg0
and Hg++ are nephrotoxic. Vapour inhalation is the principal
route of exposure to elemental mercury, which is then
oxidised to Hg++ and excreted in the urine.
It is estimated that the majority of the daily intake of
mercury compounds is MeHg derived from dietary sources
(contaminated fish) and to a lesser extent, elemental
mercury from mercury vapour in dental amalgams.7 8 In
1999, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
issued a public health statement on mercury, stating that
dental amalgam was a major source of elemental mercury
exposure in the general population. Other common sources of
elemental mercury exposure are certain occupations, house-
hold products such as batteries, thermostats, fluorescent
lights, and thermometers, and also contaminated air near
medical incinerators and coal burning power plants.9
Approximately 95% of MeHg in fish is absorbed by the
gastrointestinal tract10 and MeHg has a biological half-life of
about 70 days.11 Total blood mercury is a principal biomarker
for MeHg exposure but it is thought that a small amount of
blood MeHg is metabolised to IHg and excreted in the urine.8
Historically, the composition of dental amalgam has
changed very little with the mixture containing copper, tin,
silver, and up to 50% of elemental mercury by weight.

Mercury vapour can be released from amalgam restorations
during periods of chewing,12­14 nocturnal bruxism,15 and
consumer teeth whitening products.16 17 About 30­50% of
the generated mercury vapour is inhaled, with 80% absorbed
via the lungs and distributed to the brain and kidneys.7 18 19
Elimination is via the urine and faeces,20­22 and up to 40% of
the absorbed mercury is eliminated within 30 days following
vapour exposure.23 It is estimated that for every 10 dental
amalgam surfaces, mercury urinary concentrations will
increase by 1 mg/l.24
Accurate national estimates of IHg body burden among
persons with dental amalgams are essential for any popula-
tion based risk assessment. Except for one large retrospective
cohort study involving military men,24 most prior US research
on amalgam restorations and mercury levels has been clinical
studies involving limited populations. The aim of our study is
twofold: (1) to describe the relation between dental restora-
tions and urine mercury concentrations using a nationally
representative sample of women of childbearing age; and (2)
to produce models that improve our understanding of risk
indicators for increased urinary mercury for women in the
USA.
METHODS
Study population
We used data from the 1999­2000 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a representative
sample of the civilian, non-institutionalised population in the
USA. The 1999­2000 NHANES over sampled persons 12­19
years of age, persons 60 years and older, non-Hispanic blacks,
and Mexican Americans. Furthermore, all women who
indicated that they were pregnant at the time of the
screening interview were selected into the sample, and low
income white persons were over sampled in 2000. An
institutional review board approved the 1999­2000
NHANES protocols and informed consent was obtained from
all participants, with parents or guardians providing consent
for individuals less than 18 years of age. The NHANES is
conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Information for
accessing the 1999­2000 NHANES data, technical notes, and
guidelines used can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
about/major/nhanes/NHANES99_00.htm.
The 1999­2000 NHANES assessed mercury exposure in
women 16­49 years old. There were 1944 women aged 16­49
years old who completed a home interview. We excluded 125
women who did not participate in the examination at a
mobile examination centre and 71 women who lacked urine
mercury or creatinine data. We excluded 107 participants
lacking information on dental restorations and 12 women
who were edentulous. Three individuals with extremely high
levels of urine, blood, and hair mercury were excluded
because it was unlikely that their mercury exposure was
related to dental amalgam. The final analytical study group
was 1626 persons.
Mercury
Urine specimens were analysed by flow injection cold vapour
atomic absorption by the Division of Laboratory Sciences at
CDC's National Center for Environmental Health.25 The limit
of detection for urine mercury was 0.14 mg/l. Mercury was
measured by the Perkin-Elmer Flow Injection Mercury
System (FIMS-400) spectrometer. The coefficient of variation
for urine mercury during the testing period was 10% or less.
Automated cold vapour atomic absorption spectrophotometry
was used to analyse whole blood specimens for inorganic and
total mercury. Details of these methods have been previously
described.26
Dental restorations
The dental examinations were conducted in the mobile
examination centre (MEC) by trained dentists who were
periodically calibrated by the survey's expert dental examiner
(author). Inter-rater reliability for coronal dental caries and
restorations was excellent (mean kappa scores for each
examiner was 0.96). To evaluate for intra-rater reliability,
dental examiners performed a second examination at a later
date on approximately 5% of the sample (mean kappa scores
for examiners ranged from 0.93 to 0.94). Because the 1999­
2000 NHANES oral health protocols did not assess for the

N Accurate reference data for mercury exposure from
dental amalgams is not available for the general
population; however, the 1999­2000 National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey provides represen-
tative US data on mercury exposure and dental care
for women of reproductive age.

posterior dental surfaces were restored with amal-

material composition of dental restorations, we derived the
dental amalgam information by two methods: by the number
of dental surfaces with restorations and by the extent a
participant had dental surfaces restored.
We derived amalgam restorations by counting the number
of surfaces of posterior teeth (that is, molars and premolars)
with dental restorations. Each posterior tooth has five coronal
surfaces: mesial (the front facing interproximal side),
occlusal (the chewing area of a tooth), distal (the interprox-
imal side towards the tonsils/pharynx), buccal (the cheek
side), and lingual (the tongue side). We also derived the
number of occlusal surfaces restored with dental amalgam. If
a tooth had all five dental surfaces restored, we assumed that
those surfaces were restored with a fabricated dental crown
and we excluded those surfaces from the amalgam deriva-
tion. The extent of amalgam restored surfaces was calculated
by summing the derived surfaces, dividing by the number of
dental surfaces evaluated, and multiplying by 100.
Covariates
Demographic and health behaviour data were obtained from
a home interview questionnaire and an MEC interview. Race/
ethnicity was categorised as non-Hispanic black, Mexican
American, non-Hispanic white, and ``other''. Persons identi-
fied as ``other'' were included in the total population
estimates but not in the regression analyses. Educational
attainment was categorised as having some college educa-
tion, completing high school, or not completing high school.
Using guidelines established by the National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, an individual's reported
average alcohol consumption over the past 12 months was
categorised as moderate or heavy drinker, light drinker, or
abstainer.27 Information for both education and alcohol
consumption was available only for persons 20 years of age
or older when we conducted our study. Persons with a serum
cotinine level of 10 ng/ml or higher were classified as current
smokers.
Recent dental care utilisation was dichotomised as either
having a dental visit in the past 12 months or not. Fish and
shellfish information was obtained from a MEC dietary
interview. Following the 24-hour dietary recall, respondents
were queried regarding consumption of various species of
fish or shellfish during the past 30 days. Individuals were
grouped into either having consumed any fish and/or
shellfish within the past 30 days or not. Age was analysed
in 16­19, 20­34, and 35­49 year old age groups. Pregnancy
information was obtained from self-report and MEC preg-
nancy test results.
We used information on lean skeletal muscle mass, fasting,
and urine creatinine to correct for urine dilution effects as
part of the modelling process and is detailed further in the
Discussion section. Lean skeletal muscle mass (kg) was
estimated with a validated prediction equation.28 The
reported number of whole hours since food or drink was
last consumed was used to determine fasting status. Fasting
was used as a discrete variable and ranged from 0­46 hours.
Urine creatinine levels (mg/dl) were measured with a
Beckman Synchron CX3 Clinical Analyser which uses the
Jaffe
` rate reaction.29 We used creatinine in urine as a
continuous variable for this analysis. In the medical
literature, both unadjusted and creatinine corrected urinary
mercury values are commonly reported. We include both
approaches in our results to allow for comparisons with other
studies in the literature.
Data analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with SUDAAN soft-
ware (Version 8.0; RTI, Research Triangle Park, NC) and SAS
software (Version 8.02; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). We
used sample weights to account for the unequal probability of
selection and non-response to the study to produce estimates,
regression coefficients, and related standard errors. Standard
errors were calculated in SUDAAN using the delete 1
jackknife method. The mercury geometric means were
obtained with the GEOMETRIC option in SUDAAN and
standard deviations were calculated in SAS using the
algorithm described in the Appendix. Because mercury was
not normally distributed in blood or urine, we used the
natural log transformation. Weighted Pearson correlation
coefficients and related p values were calculated in SAS.
Linear regression models were used to estimate unadjusted
and adjusted coefficients and related standard errors with
p , 0.05 considered statistically significant. The log transfor-
mation of urine mercury and creatinine corrected urinary
mercury were used as dependent variables. All independent
variables were modelled as previously described; regressions
were performed separately for the total number of derived
amalgam dental restorations and the extent of amalgam
restorations. We used non-automated stepwise regression
modelling to assess the relation between the covariates.
Parsimonious models were determined by covariate exclusion
with criteria for inclusion set at p , 0.05 using the Wald F-
statistic. We assessed for potential interactions throughout the
modelling process but no significant interactions were found.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents the sample size and distribution by selected
characteristics for women 16­49 years of age. More than 70%
had reported a dental visit within the past 12 months, 25.7%
were smokers, and nearly 78% had consumed some fish and/
or shellfish in the past 30 days. Table 2 shows the mean
mercury concentrations for this study group. The urinary
mercury geometric mean for all women was 0.72 mg/l and the
arithmetic mean was 1.34 mg/l. The creatinine corrected
urinary mercury geometric and arithmetic means was
1.10 mg/g and 0.71 mg/g respectively.
The mean number of posterior dental surfaces for women
aged 16­49 years in the USA was 71.6 with 12.3 surfaces
restored (table 3). We estimate that 8.7 posterior surfaces and
4.9 occlusal surfaces were amalgam dental restorations and
12.4% of all posterior dental surfaces were restored with
dental amalgams. Younger women, non-smokers, and those
with some college education had a greater number of teeth.
Women 35­49 years old, non-Hispanic whites, and persons
who had a dental visit within the past 12 months had a
greater percentage of dental surfaces restored with dental
amalgam. Non-Hispanic whites, non-smokers, those who
have consumed fish and/or shellfish in the past 30 days, and
persons who had a dental visit within the past 12 months
had more posterior dental amalgam restorations.
Table 4 shows correlations between mercury concentra-
tions and dental characteristics. All correlations for dental
amalgam exposure were statistically significant for either
mercury in urine or creatinine corrected mercury urinary
mercury on both the original and log scales. The Pearson
correlation coefficients were 0.321 and 0.340 respectively for
the extent of amalgam exposure and the number of amalgam
dental surfaces for mercury in urine on the non-transformed
scale. The correlations between the extent of amalgam
exposure and the number of amalgam dental surfaces for
creatinine corrected urinary mercury on the log scale were
0.546 and 0.579.
Table 5 presents results from linear regression models
for log transformed urine mercury and creatinine corrected
urine mercury. Unadjusted regression models show that
urine mercury levels were significantly associated (p , 0.05)
with being 20­34 years old, non-Hispanic black, smoking,
consuming fish and/or shellfish in the past 30 days, higher

total blood mercury concentrations, and an increasing
number of dental amalgam surfaces. In a multivariate linear
model identifying the most parsimonious covariates when
the exposure variable was the number of dental amalgam
surfaces, only age, race/ethnicity, total mercury in blood, and
the number of dental amalgam surfaces were significantly
associated with log transformed urine mercury levels (model
1). The R2 for model 1 was 0.3183. In a separate analysis (not
shown) we found no relation between general employment
status (that is, working versus not working) and mercury
concentrations in urine.
Unadjusted regression models show that creatinine corrected
urine mercury levels were significantly associated (p , 0.05)
with age, lower educational attainment, smoking, having a
dental visit within the past 12 months, consuming fish and/or
shellfish in the past 30 days, higher total blood mercury
concentrations, and an increasing number and extent of dental
amalgam surfaces. In a parsimonious multivariate linear model
when the exposure variable was the number of dental amalgam
surfaces (model 2), only smoking, total mercury in blood, and
the number of dental amalgam surfaces were significantly
associated with log transformed creatinine corrected urine
mercury levels. The R2 for model 2 was 0.5204.
DISCUSSION
These findings are consistent with previous reports that
indicate mercury in urine is significantly associated with an
increasing burden of restored amalgam dental surfaces.20 24 30­34
Results from our modelling indicate that an estimated
increase of 0.7 mg/l in the log transformed values for
mercury concentration in urine would occur for every 10
dental surfaces restored with amalgam (b = 0.07). A similar
finding was observed for creatinine corrected urinary
mercury concentration (b = 0.06). Given that women in
this study group had approximately nine dental amalgam
surfaces (n = 8.7), we estimate that dental amalgams
contribute approximately 0.6 mg/l to the overall log trans-
formed urinary mercury concentrations for the average
woman in the USA. Kingman and coworkers estimated
that an increase of nearly 0.5 mg/l in the log transformed
value for total urinary mercury concentration would occur
for every 10 surfaces of dental amalgam (b = 0.045) in
men.24 On the non-log scale, our findings indicate that for
every 10 dental amalgam surfaces, creatinine corrected
urinary mercury concentration would increase by 1.8 mg/g.
For context, we found that 75% of women in the USA had
approximately 12 restored posterior dental surfaces or less,
and within this group, the average creatinine corrected
urinary mercury concentration was 0.81 mg/g (urine mercury
concentration was 1.03 mg/l) (data not shown).
Our findings suggest that the background urinary mercury
concentration for dentate women of reproductive age (that is,
urine mercury levels for women with no dental restorations)
is 0.69 mg/l in the USA and the geometric mean is 0.35 mg/l
(data not shown). This finding is very similar to the estimate
reported by Kingman and coworkers for background urinary

white men (arithmetic mean = 0.70 mg/l).24 For background
creatinine corrected urinary mercury, the mean concentration
for women is 0.50 mg/g and the geometric mean is 0.31 mg/g
(data not shown).
Our analysis is unique in that two different analytical
approaches were employed during the modelling process that
used urine creatinine to correct for urine dilution effects. One
standard approach has been to divide urine mercury by urine
creatinine to produce a creatinine corrected urinary mercury
level. We used this derivation as the dependent variable for
regression analyses presented in table 5. In an alternative
approach, we used urinary creatinine as an independent
variable along with the other covariates of fasting status and
lean skeletal muscle mass to adjust for the effects of urinary
dilution on mercury levels. The results of these regression
analyses produced similar beta coefficients for the dental
amalgam exposure covariates. Additionally, urine creatinine
levels, leaner skeletal muscle mass, and length of the fast
were significantly associated with log transformed urine
mercury levels in a parsimonious multivariate linear model
(data not shown).

Total mercury in blood, an indicator of MeHg exposure,35
remained a significant indicator for urine mercury concen-
trations in the parsimonious models, whereas fish or shellfish
consumption did not. The multivariate regression results
presented here are consistent with the metabolism of MeHg
to IHg8 and suggest that MeHg exposure from fish
consumption contributes to urinary mercury levels. It is also
possible that IHg levels due to amalgam exposure are a
component of total blood mercury, particularly in women
with low fish consumption.
It has been reported that the elimination of mercury from
blood following removal of dental amalgam reflects a half-
life of approximately 30 days.36 In addition to seafood
consumption, Vahter and coworkers have reported that IHg
in maternal and cord blood and mercury in fetal tissues
increases as the number of maternal dental amalgam
increases.37 Additionally, it has been reported that mercury
in breast milk at the time of birth was associated with the
number of dental amalgam restorations and fish consump-
tion, but after two months of lactation, only fish consump-
tion remained significant.38 Consequently, the speciation of
mercury is an important consideration for assessing exposure
and evaluating health risks.
While pregnant women have higher plasma volumes and
higher globular filtration rates (GFRs), independent effects of
pregnancy on urine IHg were not significant during the
regression modelling. We also investigated potential effects of
moderate/severe renal impairment (GFR ,60), proteinuria,
and a very high recent dietary protein intake on urinary
mercury levels, and found no relation to urinary mercury
concentrations. Although selenium may interact with mer-
cury,39 40 serum selenium data was not available to address
this issue.
Alcohol is a competitive substrate for the hydrogen
peroxide catalase pathway in red blood cells that oxidises
inhaled elemental mercury into its divalent inorganic form,
which is subsequently excreted in the urine. Although a
positive association with alcohol intake and mercury exhala-
tion has been reported,41 Kingman and coworkers found a
negative association between alcohol consumption and
urinary mercury.24 Others have reported no association
between alcohol and urinary mercury.42 43 Our findings also
suggest a lack of an association, but the relatively low overall
consumption of alcohol per person limited our ability to
address this issue.
Socioeconomic influences significantly affect the utilisa-
tion of dental care. Because poverty/income information was
unavailable at the time of this analysis, we used education
and dental visit information to mitigate this limitation.
Although we were unable to use information on education
for persons 16­19 years of age, we did analyse the data for
20­49 year olds and found no significant contribution to the

study outcomes. Occupational exposure to mercury could be
a potential confounder for our study. The detailed occupation
data for NHANES 1999­2000 NHANES was not available for
analysis. As a practical matter, large numbers of women in
this age range are home makers, and have never been
employed. Further, as a nationally representative sample, the
frequency of persons employed in mercury exposed occupa-
tions in NHANES (that is, certain manufacturing jobs, dental
workers, etc) is comparatively small. Also, we found no
relation between general employment status and urinary
mercury concentrations.
Although very small amounts of mercury are known to
occur in tobacco products,44­46 our final regression models
indicated a significant inverse association between smoking
and urinary mercury levels. We do not have an explanation
for this finding. We believe it is potentially due to an
unidentified confounder, such as dental health care beha-
viour, rather than representing a true biological effect.
There are additional study limitations. Our cross-sectional
design does not permit definitive evaluation of causality or
temporal relations. Because we used posterior dental restora-
tions as a surrogate for amalgam fillings, misclassification of
exposure may have affected our findings. We minimised this
bias by discounting any restored surface area indicative of a
fabricated dental crown. Additionally, some of the dental
surfaces could have been restored with non-amalgam
materials; however, this misclassification error most likely
would have underestimated the magnitude of the association
between urinary mercury and dental amalgams. Although we
cannot quantitate this error, it is notable that our findings are
similar to the Kingman et al study which used actual clinical
information on amalgam restorations. The strength of this
study is its use of a nationally representative sample not
selected by multiple risk indicators or other potentially
confounding factors.
This is the first study to evaluate the relation between
dental restorations and mercury concentrations in a nation-
ally representative sample in the United States. Our findings
show that among women in the USA increasing mercury
levels in urine are associated with increased numbers of
dental amalgam surfaces. Although our findings do not
address the important issues of adverse health effects at low
thresholds of mercury exposure, they do provide important
reference data that should contribute significantly to the
ongoing scientific and public health policy debate on the use
of dental amalgams in the USA.

APPENDIX
The standard deviation of the mean is calculated by applying
the formula,
where Stdsrs
is the standard deviation of the variable which
can be obtained through SAS PROC means or univariate, and
semcs
is the standard error of the mean estimated by means
of the delete 1 jackknife method. This transformation is
applied to account for the complex sample design to obtain a
design based estimate of the standard deviation.
The standard deviation of the geometric mean is first
calculated on the log scale by applying the formula,
where Stdsrs
is the standard deviation of the log transformed
variable which can be obtained through SAS PROC means or
univariate and semcs
is the standard error of the mean
estimated by means of the delete 1 jackknife method. This
transformation is applied to account for the complex sample
design to obtain a design based estimate of the standard
deviation and is then back transformed to obtain the desired
result.
