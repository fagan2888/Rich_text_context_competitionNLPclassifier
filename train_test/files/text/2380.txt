Abstract
Objectives. There is growing enthusiasm for community initiatives that aim to strengthen neighbor relationships to
promote well-being in later life. Nevertheless, few studies have examined the extent to which relationships with neigh-
bors are associated with better psychological well-being among midlife and older adults.
Methods.We used data from 1,071 noninstitutionalized, English-speaking adults, aged 40­70 years, who partici-
pated in both waves of the 1995­2005 National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States. Lagged dependent
regression models were estimated to examine associations between changes in two dimensions of neighbor relationships
(contact and perceived support) and psychological well-being.
Results. Few associations were found between relationships with neighbors and negative or positive affect. In con-
trast, having continuously low levels of contact with neighbors, or losing contact with neighbors over the 10-year study
period, was associated with declining levels of eudaimonic well-being. Associations between contact and this aspect of
well-being were explained, in part, by less perceived support from neighbors.
Discussion.Results suggest that continuity and change in relationships with neighbors is especially important for
more developmental aspects of psychological well-being. Implications for future research on the meaning of neighbor
relationships and aging in community are discussed.
Key Words: Aging in community--Community--Social networks--Social relationships--Well-being.
RECOGNIZING the importance of maintaining social
relationships in middle and later life, a growing num-
ber of aging services models have developed within the past
several decades, seeking to strengthen social relationships
among residents within a local area to help older adults
remain in their own homes and communities. Examples
of such models include Villages, Naturally Occurring
Retirement Community (NORC) Supportive Service
Programs, and Supportive Communities (Berg-Warman &
Brodsky, 2006; Greenfield, Scharlach, Lehning, & Davitt,
2012). Despite the emergence of these place-based initia-
tives, there is still little research on the implications of neigh-
bor relationships for psychological well-being. Research has
continued to mainly focus on the role of families, or social
relationships in general, in the lives of older adults.
To address the lack of research in this area, we used
data from the 1995­2005 National Survey of Midlife
Development in the United States (MIDUS) to examine
associations between continuity and change in neighbor
relationships and psychological well-being among adults in
middle and later life. Guided by a multidimensional frame-
work on social relationships, as well as on psychological
well-being, we explored whether either aspect of neighbor
relationships (frequency of contact and perceived support) is
especially important for particular dimensions of well-being
(negative affect, positive affect, and eudaimonic well-being).
Meaning of Relationships With Neighbors
Classic theorizing on the significance of neighbor rela-
tionships traditionally has emphasized their instrumental
value. According to the theory of shared functions (Litwak
and Szelenyi, 1969), neighbors are best suited for tasks that
require proximity, immediacy, and menial instrumental
tasks. Cantor (1979) also posited that neighbors are "third
in line" behind family and friends to provide assistance to
older adults. Recent qualitative studies have further high-
lighted the significance of helping among neighbors, with
particular attention to anticipated support. In-depth inter-
views with older adults have found that neighbors are per-
ceived as being especially important in case of an emergency
and that being able to rely on neighbors can reduce con-
cerns regarding personal safety (Lau, Machizawa, & Doi,
2012; Thomése, Tilburg, and Knipscheer, 2003; Walker &
Hiller, 2007). Studies of caregiving among neighbors sug-
gest that, most typically, neighbors assist each other with
instrumental and nonintimate tasks, such as bill paying
607
Greenfield and Reyes
and transportation, although in some cases, they also are
involved in personal care (Barker, 2002; Nocon & Pearson,
2000).
More recently, scholars have described the role of neigh-
bors beyond their instrumental value. Some studies have
indicated ways in which neighbors socialize with each
other without exchanging any instrumental support. For
example, observational and interview studies of older adults
within their community indicate that neighbors' spontane-
ous interactions with each other in public spaces--such as
at restaurants--provide a sense of community, structure
and purpose, friendship, humor, and an outlet for personal
expression (Cheang, 2002; Gardner, 2011). Studies on
exchanged support among neighbors suggest that although
the degree and complexity of help exchanged varies, neigh-
bors who provide each other support typically are engaged
in some degree of social activity with each other, such as
going out for meals (Barker, 2002).
Neighbor Relationships and Psychological Well-being
Despite a preponderance of population research demon-
strating that positive social relationships are beneficial for
individuals' mental and physical health (e.g., Antonucci,
Fuhrer, & Dartigues, 1997; Litwin & Shiovitz-Ezra, 2006;
Uchino, 2004), quantitative studies that examine the con-
tributions of relationships with neighbors for psychologi-
cal well-being have been few in number. Many of these
studies have been conducted outside of the United States
(e.g., Farrell, Aubry, & Coulombe, 2004; Morita, Takano,
Nakamura, Kizuki, & Seino, 2010; Pinquart, 2003) and have
utilized regional or targeted samples. For example, a study of
widowers over the age of 60 years found that more frequent
social contact with friends and neighbors was associated
with more positive affect and higher well-being, whereas
contact with children and siblings was not (Balaswamy &
Richardson, 2001). Taylor, Chatters, Hardison, and Riley
(2001) found that when African Americans had higher fre-
quency of contact with neighbors, their life satisfaction and
happiness were greater (Taylor et al., 2001). Using popula-
tion data from adults aged 70 and older in the Netherlands,
Cramm, van Dijk, and Nieboer (2013) found that exchang-
ing favors with neighbors and greetings among neighbors
were associated with higher levels of well-being.
Although population studies have examined factors that
predict the quality of relationships among neighbors (e.g.,
Cornwell, Laumann, & Schumm, 2008; Perren, Arber, &
Davidson, 2004), few studies have used U.S. national data
to examine associations between relationships with neigh-
bors specifically and psychological well-being. For exam-
ple, a study by Mair and Thivierge-Rikard (2010) used data
from the 1994 Americans' Changing Lives study and found
that higher scores on a measure that collectively assessed
frequency of visiting with friends, neighbors, and rela-
tives were associated with higher levels of psychological
well-being among older adults. To the best of our knowl-
edge, Shaw (2005) conducted the only study that used
U.S. national data to examine associations between neigh-
bor relationships specifically and one aspect of psychologi-
cal well-being. Using cross-sectional data from adults in
the 1995 National Survey of MIDUS and controlling for a
variety of sociodemographic factors, this study found that
greater anticipated support from neighbors was associated
with a greater sense of control.
The Current Study
This study seeks to advance understanding of relation-
ships with neighbors and psychological well-being in three
primary ways. First, we utilized data from a longitudinal
U.S. sample. Having a large and heterogeneous sample
allows for statistical control of a variety of factors that
might render associations between neighbor relationships
and psychological well-being as spurious. Such factors
include adults' quality of relationships with family and
friends (Ensher & Murphy, 1997; Umberson et al., 1996),
functional health (Shaw, 2005) and sociodemographic
characteristics (Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998; Ryff & Keyes,
1995). Moreover, longitudinal data allow for drawing upon
a primary insight from life course and life span perspec-
tives: that social relationships potentially change over time
(Antonucci, Fiori, Birditt, & Jackey, 2010). Unlike previous
quantitative studies, which largely have examined neighbor
relationships at a single point in time, our study consid-
ers that over a 10-year period, people's relationships with
neighbors might change.
Also, this study examined several theoretically derived
dimensions of psychological well-being. Guided by the
idea that positive states of well-being are not synony-
mous with the absence of negative states (Seligman &
Csikszentmihalyi, 2000), we examined both positive and
negative affect. Negative affect involves experiences of
distressing moods and emotions--such as feeling sad--
whereas positive affect involves experiences of pleasant
moods and emotions--such as feeling cheerful. Moreover,
a growing body of research suggests that experiences of
psychological well-being are not limited to affective states,
or feeling good, but also include perceptions of how one
is engaging with their psychosocial world, or doing well
(Jayawickreme, Forgeard, & Seligman, 2012; Ryff, 1989).
Following this theorizing, we examined eudaimonic well-
being (Ryan & Deci, 2001), which addresses how adults
view themselves with respect to important adult develop-
mental issues, including having a sense of purpose, expe-
riencing continued feelings of growth, and feeling mastery
over one's own environment (Ryff & Keyes, 1995). Taken
together, eudaimonic well-being addresses the extent to
which adults are "... fully functioning or optimally devel-
oped" (Ryff, 2014, p. 11) and support the idea--originat-
ing from Aristotle's classic theorizing--that well-being
608
Neighbor Relationships and Psychological Well-being
is not simply the presence of pleasure and the absence
of 
distress (Ryff & Singer, 2008). In other words, while

positive and negative affect refer to people's feelings,
eudaimonic 
well-being indicates their psychosocial func-
tioning (Keyes & Annas, 2009). Eudaimonic well-being
is consistent with an "aging in community" framework,
which emphasizes psychosocial qualities that indicate
aging well in one's own community, such as opportuni-
ties to engage in new activities and interests, contribute to
one's 
community, and leverage the environment to meet
one's needs (Scharlach & Lehning, 2013; Thomas and
Blanchard, 2009).
In addition to considering multiple dimensions of psy-
chological well-being, we also examined two dimensions of
neighbor relationships: contact and support. Whereas contact
is a structural aspect of social relationships, perceived support
reflects, in part, the quality of interactions among relational
actors (House, Umberson, and Landis, 1988). Given prior the-
orizing on the importance of relationships with neighbors both
in terms of their instrumental utility, as well as their broader
sociality, we expect that both dimensions of neighbor relation-
ships will be associated with better psychological well-being.
In summary, we posited the following hypotheses (H)
and research question (RQ):
H1:
Adults who experience continuously high levels of
contact with neighbors and adults whose contact
with neighbors increases over time will report better
psychological well-being than adults who experience
continuously low contact with their neighbors or who
experience a loss in contact with neighbors.
H2:
Adults who experience continuously high levels of
perceived support from neighbors and adults whose
perceived support from neighbors increases over
time will report better psychological well-being than
adults who experience continuously low-perceived
support from their neighbors or who experience a
loss in perceived support from neighbors.
RQ:
Are associations between neighbor relationships
and psychological well-being specific to one par-
ticular aspect of relationships (contact or perceived
support)?
Method
A secondary data analysis was conducted with two-wave
panel data from the main national sample of the 1995­2005
MIDUS. The sample was obtained initially in 1995­1996
(T1) through random digit dial sampling of noninstitution-
alized, English-speaking adults, aged 25­74, living in the
United States. A follow-up study was conducted in 2004­
2006 (T2). Participation at each wave involved an initial
30-min telephone interview, followed by a self-adminis-
tered, mail-back questionnaire.
The analytic sample for this study consisted of adults
aged between 40 and 70 years at T1 who also participated in
the study at T2. We used data from adults of at least 40 years
of age to focus this study on people in middle and later life.
At T1, there were 1,848 respondents who met our initial
analytic sample criteria (i.e., aged between 40 and 70 years
and completed both the self-administered questionnaire and
telephone interviews). By T2, 194 of these respondents were
identified as deceased. This yielded 1,654 potential respond-
ents at T2, of which 1,118 participated (i.e., completed both
a telephone interview and a self-administered question-
naire), making the longitudinal response rate 67.6%. We
found that participants who reported more negative affect,
more functional impairment, and who were black at T1 were
more likely to be nonrespondents at T2. Of the 1,118 par-
ticipants in our analytic sample, 4.2% (47 respondents) did
not have complete data across all of the variables. Given this
small amount of item nonresponse, as well as no evidence
for systematic patterns of item missingness, we used listwise
deletion to handle missing data on account of item nonre-
sponse. Tables 1 and 2 display descriptive statistics for the
1,071 respondents included in the analytic sample.
Measures
Dependent variables.--At T1 and T2, negative and posi-
tive affect were measured through a series of six items each
(Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998), which asked respondents how
often during the past 30 days they felt various moods and
emotions. Items for negative affect included (a) so sad
nothing could cheer them up, (b) nervous, (c) restless or
fidgety, (d) hopeless, (e) that everything was an effort, and
(f) worthless. Items for positive affect included (a) cheer-
ful, (b) in good spirits, (c) extremely happy, (d) calm and
peaceful, (e) satisfied, and (f) full of life. These scales were
developed for use in the MIDUS based on several prior
widely used measures, and the six items for each were
selected based on pretests for the MIDUS survey (see Carr,
Friedman, & Jaffe, 2007, as well as Mroczek & Kolarz, for

further discussion). Respondents answered each question
on a 5-point scale (1 = all the time; 5 = none of the time).
Scores on all items were averaged together and coded such
that higher scores indicated more negative or positive affect.
Cronbach's alpha at T2 was .84 for negative affect and .90
for positive affect.
The measure of eudaimonic well-being was a compos-
ite of participants' ratings of their psychosocial function-
ing across six interrelated domains (Ryff & Keyes, 1995),
which has been used within other studies of social factors
and psychological well-being (e.g., Bookwala & Boyar,
2008; Human, Biesanz, Miller, Chen, Lachman, & Seeman,
2013; Son & Wilson, 2012). Each domain was assessed
with three items, including purpose in life ("I have a sense
of direction and purpose in life"), environmental mastery
("In general, I feel I am in charge of the situation in which
I live"), personal growth ("For me, life has been a continu-
ous process of learning, changing, and growth"), autonomy
("In general, I feel I am in charge of the situation in which
I live"), self-acceptance ("I like most parts of my person-
ality"), and positive relations with others ("People would
describe me as a giving person, willing to share my time
with others"). Respondents answered each question using
a 7-point scale (1 = agree strongly; 7 = disagree strongly),
and scores were averaged together and coded such that
higher scores indicated more eudaimonic well-being. The
Cronbach's alpha for the 18-item scale at T2 was .83.
Relationships with neighbors.--To measure relation-
ships with neighbors, four items were used from the self-
administered questionnaire at T1 to create two variables:
contact and perceived support. Contact with neighbors was
created from two questions: "How often do you have any
contact, even something as simple as saying `hello', with
any of your neighbors?" and "How often do you have a
real conversation or get together socially with any of your
neighbors?". Responses were provided on a 6-point scale
(1 = almost every day; 6 = never or hardly ever). Scores
for these two questions were reverse-recoded and averaged
together such that higher scores indicated more frequent
contact with neighbors.
Perceived support from neighbors was measured based
on responses to two items from a 4-item scale inquiring
about the participant's personal beliefs on neighborhood
at T1 (Keyes, 1998): "I could call on a neighbor for help
if I needed it" and "People in my neighborhood trust each
other." Respondents answered both questions on a 4-point
scale (1 = a lot; 4 = not at all). Scores for these items were
reverse coded and summed such that higher scores indi-
cated higher levels of perceived support from neighbors.
To create variables indicating continuity and change in
relationships with neighbors, we conducted a median split
on the variables at T1, whereby participants were assigned
to either the top or the bottom 50th percentile on contact
and support at T1, as well as at T2. For contact, the median
at both T1 and T2 was 4.0. For support, the median was 3.5.
Using these dichotomous scores at T1 and T2, participants
were then coded into one of four mutually exclusive cat-
egories for contact: continuously high contact (in the top
50th percentile at both T1 and T2), continuously low con-
tact (below the 50th percentile at both T1 and T2), gained
contact (in the bottom at T1 and in the top at T2), and lost
contact (in the top at T1 and in the bottom at T2). The same
process was used to create a four-category variable for per-
ceived support.
Covariates.--Measures of covariates included gender
(female or male), education (less than high school, high
school graduate, some college, or college graduate and
higher), age, and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Hispanic, or other race/ethnicity). We also
included a measure of functional limitations at T1, which
was assessed with seven items referring to particular tasks,
such as "lifting or carrying groceries" and "walking sev-
eral blocks." Participants answered the extent to which
their health limited them on each item on a 4-point scale,
and scores were averaged together such that higher scores
indicated greater functional limitations. Furthermore,

Notes. Data are from 1,071 respondents who were aged between 40 and
70 years at T1 and who participated in two waves of data collection for the
1995­2005 National Survey of Midlife in the United States. Median splits were
used to create the multicategorical variables regarding contact and perceived
support with neighbors from T1 (1995) to T2 (2005). All other measures were
taken from T1 except for race/ethnicity and length of residence, which were
used from T2.

Neighbor Relationships and Psychological Well-being
we included a measure at T2 that indicated whether par-
ticipants reported living in their current residence for less
than 10 years, which served as a proxy for whether or not
respondents had moved between T1 and T2. (Because of the
secondary nature of this analysis, we did not have a direct
measure of whether participants relocated between waves.)
Finally, we included a measure of contact with family
and friends, as well as a measure of perceived support from
family and friends at T1. Scores on contact were calculated
as the average of participants' responses to two questions
regarding how often participants were in contact "includ-
ing visits, phone call, letters, or electronic mail messages"
with (a) any members of their family and (b) any of their
friends (1 = never or hardly ever; 6 = several times a day).
Scores on perceived support were calculated as the average
of participants' responses to four questions regarding sup-
port with family, as well as four parallel questions regarding
support with friends, such as "Not including your spouse or
partners, how much do members of your family really care
about you?" (Schuster, Kessler, & Aseltine, 1990; Whalen
& Lachman, 2000). Responses were given on a 4-point
scale, averaged together, and coded such that higher scores
indicated more support from family and friends (1 = not at
all; 4 = a lot).
Data Analytic Strategy
We estimated ordinary least squares multivariate regres-
sion models. All models included the covariates and the
respective dependent variable at T1 (negative affect, posi-
tive affect, or eudaimonic well-being) as independent vari-
ables. We standardized scores on psychological well-being
for ease of interpretability across the multiple dimensions.
The multicategorical variables indicating relationships with
neighbors were entered as a block of three dichotomous
variables--continuously low, loss, and gain--with continu-
ously high as the reference group. The coefficients in the
models, therefore, indicate whether people in each of the
three former relationship categories differ in psychologi-
cal well-being from people who reported continuously high
contact or perceived support with neighbors. We first pre-
sent models for contact with neighbors, followed by per-
ceived support from neighbors, and then a final model with
both contact and perceived support when prior models indi-
cated statistically significant associations for both contact
and perceived support.
As an analytic check, we tested all possible interactions
between the covariates and the focal independent variables
regarding relationships with neighbors.Across the 108 inter-
action terms examined, only five were statistically significant
(p < .05) and in no readily interpretable pattern. Therefore,
we present results for the analytic sample as a whole.
Given this study's focus on multiple dimensions of psycho-
logical well-being, we examined the correlations among the
dependent variables. Correlations among the dependent vari-
ables at T2 were between -.589 and .547, demonstrating that
the three dependent variables were related to each other as
aspects of psychological well-being, yet somewhat distinct in
measuring different dimensions of psychological well-being.
Furthermore, we examined correlations among the items
comprising the measure of contact with neighbors and per-
ceived support from neighbors. The correlation between the
two items regarding contact was .58, and the correlation
between the two items regarding perceived support was .47.
Given the relatively small size of this correlation, we esti-
mated preliminary analyses to check whether multivariate
results differed when perceived support from neighbors was
measured by either one of the two items. No differences
were found.
Finally, given the multidimensional nature of the meas-
ure of eudaimonic well-being, as well as controversy over
how related-yet-distinct the component subdimensions are
(see Abbott et al., 2006, for further discussion), we esti-
mated models for each of the six subcomponents indepen-
dently (i.e., autonomy, purpose in life, personal growth,
self-acceptance, environmental mastery, and positive rela-
tions with others). Results indicated that the final pattern
of results, which used the composite measure, were overall
consistent across each individual subdimension.
Results
H1: Contact with Neighbors and Psychological Well-being
Models 1a, 2a, and 3a in Table 3 present results from
multivariate regression models that examined associations
between frequency of contact with neighbors and changes
in psychological well-being over the 10-year study period.
No evidence of associations was found for negative affect
or positive affect. In comparison with participants who
reported continuously high contact with neighbors, nega-
tive affect did not differ at a statistically significant level
among participants who reported (a) continuously low con-
tact (b = .010, n.s.), (b) loss in contact (b = .068, n.s.), and
(c) gain in contact (b = -.048, n.s.). Similarly, positive affect
did not differ at a statistically significant level among partici-
pants who reported (a) continuously low contact (b = -.091,
n.s.), (b) loss in contact (b = -.084, n.s.), and (c) gain in
contact (b = .022, n.s.) in comparison with participants who
reported continuously high contact with neighbors.
Associations were found, however, with respect to
eudaimonic well-being. In comparison to participants who
reported continuously high levels of contact with neigh-
bors, participants who reported continuously low levels of
contact reported less eudaimonic well-being (b = -.178,
p < .01). Moreover, participants who reported declining
levels of contact with neighbors also reported poorer eudai-
monic well-being (b = -.151, p < .05). No difference in
eudaimonic well-being was found between participants
with continuously high levels of contact with neighbors
and participants who gained in contact with neighbors
(b = -.079, n.s.).

In summary, these results provide partial support for H1
regarding associations between contact with neighbors and
psychological well-being. Participants who reported con-
tinuously low levels of contact, in addition to participants
who experienced losses in contact, were at greater risk for
poorer psychological well-being, specifically with respect
to eudaimonic well-being.
H2: Perceived Support With Neighbors and
Psychological Well-being
Models 1b, 2b, and 3b in Table 3 present results from
multivariate regression models that examine associations
between perceived support from neighbors and changes in
the three dimensions of psychological well-being. Similar
to the results for H1 regarding contact, no evidence of asso-
ciations was found for negative affect. In comparison to
participants who reported continuously high contact with
neighbors, negative affect did not differ at a statistically
significant level among participants who reported (a) con-
tinuously low support (b = .092, n.s.), (b) loss in support
(b = .041, n.s.), and (c) gain in support (b = -.028, n.s.).
For positive affect, only one statistically significantt asso-
ciation was found. Participants who reported continuously
low levels of perceived support from neighbors reported
less positive affect over time (b = -.0279, p < .001.) in
comparison to participants who reported continuously high
support. Nevertheless, positive affect did not differ at a sta-
tistically significant level among participants who reported
(a) loss of perceived support (b = -.023, n.s.) or (b) gain in
perceived support (b = .013, n.s.).
Associations also were found with respect to eudaimonic
well-being. In comparison to participants who reported
continuously high levels of perceived support from neigh-
bors, participants who reported continuously low levels of
support reported less eudaimonic well-being (b = -.295,
p < .001). Moreover, participants who reported declining
levels of perceived support from neighbors also reported
poorer eudaimonic well-being (b = -.202, p < .01). No dif-
ference in eudaimonic well-being was found between par-
ticipants with continuously high levels of perceived support
from neighbors and participants who gained in perceived
support from neighbors (b = -.094, n.s.).
In summary, these results provide partial support for H2
regarding associations between perceived support from neigh-
bors and psychological well-being. Participants who reported
continuously low levels of perceived support were at greater
risk for less positive affect and less eudaimonic well-being.
Participants who reported loss in perceived support were espe-
cially at risk for having lower levels of eudaimonic well-being.
RQ: Associations With Respect to Specific Aspects of
Relationships With Neighbors
To examine whether contact and perceived support
from neighbors are independent predictors of eudaimonic
well-being, we estimated a final regression model (Table 3,
Model 3c) in which the multicategorical variables for con-
tact and support were both included as independent vari-
ables. In this model, participants who reported continuously
low perceived support, as well as those who reported loss in
perceived support, demonstrated poorer eudaimonic well-
being (b = -.262, p < .001, for continuously low; b = -.177,
p < .01, for loss). However, associations between continu-
ously low levels of contact, as well as loss in contact, and
eudaimonic well-being were reduced in size and no longer
statistically significant (b = -.102, n.s, for continuously
low; b = -.105, n.s, for loss). In summary, these results
suggest that perceived support from neighbors is a more
robust predictor of eudaimonic well-being than contact with
neighbors.
Discussion
This study used U.S. population data to examine link-
ages between continuity and change in relationships with
neighbors over a 10-year period and psychological well-
being among midlife and older adults. Guided by a mul-
tidimensional perspective on social relationships (House,
Umberson, & Landis, 1988), as well as on psychological
well-being (Ryff, 1989; Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi,
2000), our study examined relationships with neighbors
in terms of contact and perceived support, as well as psy-
chological well-being in terms of negative affect, positive
affect, and eudaimonic well-being. Overall, results indi-
cated the importance of high levels of perceived support
from neighbors for maintaining optimal levels of eudai-
monic well-being.
More specifically, evidence was found that participants
who had continuously low levels of contact or perceived
support from neighbors over the 10-year study period,
as well as those who lost contact or perceived support,
were at risk for poorer eudaimonic well-being over time.
Participants who experienced gains in relationships with
neighbors had comparable levels of eudaimonic well-being
in comparison with those who maintained continuously
high levels of contact or perceived support with neighbors.
This pattern of results emerged even after accounting for
a variety of factors that could render such associations as
spurious, such as gender, age, and contact and support from
family and friends. Although prior theorizing on neighbors
has suggested this relationship to be a more peripheral
social tie for adults in the United States relative to family
and friends (e.g., Cantor, 1979), qualitative studies have
indicated that neighbors can serve as a central source of
support and meaning in adults' lives (Gardner, 2011) and
that people experience a sense of loss when such social
network members move away, die, or become unavailable
for other reasons (Rook, 2009; Walker & Hiller, 2007).
Findings from this longitudinal, population-based study
provide support for these ideas.
614
Neighbor Relationships and Psychological Well-being
Accordingly, our study contributes additional empirical
support for the importance of formal community initia-
tives that aim to help people develop and maintain strong
relationships with neighbors. Results add nuance to this
direction by suggesting that such initiatives are especially
important for promoting the more positive aspects of
adults' psychological well-being. Although no associations
between relationships with neighbors and psychological
well-being were found for negative affect, one association
was found for positive affect, and several associations were
found with respect to eudaimonic well-being. This pattern
of findings suggests that supportive neighbor relationships
are especially important for the positive and more develop-
mental and functional aspects of mental health in middle
and later life.
Overall, findings support an "aging in community"
framework (Thomas & Blanchard, 2009), which empha-
sizes developing supportive relationships among commu-
nity members not only for the sake of mitigating potential
problems in later life but also for promoting optimal func-
tioning and quality of life. In other words, results indicate
that although strong ties with neighbors might not ward off
feelings of depression, they can yield psychological gains
by helping people to feel fully engaged in adult develop-
mental tasks, such as maintaining a sense of purpose and
finding opportunities for continued personal growth.
The domain specificity of associations between relation-
ships with neighbors and psychological well-being can help
to provide insight into somewhat competing theories on the
consequences of social network changes in later life. On the
one hand, classic social scientific and gerontological theory
suggests that greater social integration--in terms of having
more social relationship partners, a greater number of social
roles, and engaging in more social activities--should be
associated with psychological benefits (Adelmann, 1994).
On the other hand, contemporary life-span developmental
theory, specifically socioemotional selectivity theory, sug-
gests that an overall shrinking of one's social network in
later life does not necessarily jeopardize well-being (English
& Carstensen, 2014). This perspective posits that fewer
peripheral social relationships result from a motivational
shift when people change how they perceive the amount of
time in their lives; when viewing one's lifetime as more lim-
ited, people orient toward relationships, goals, and pursuits
that are most meaningful to them (Carstensen, Isaacowitz,
& Charles, 1999). Results of this study demonstrate that
losses within more secondary relationships--such as those
with neighbors--might not jeopardize more emotion-based
aspects of well-being but still can jeopardize engagement-
based and developmental aspects of well-being. Insomuch
that eudaimonic well-being refers to how well one is func-
tioning, results suggest that neighbors are indeed a salient
part of many adults' "psychosocial worlds." At the same
time, these relationships might not be as psychologically
central as other ties--such as those with family and close
friends--to influence one's moods and emotions across
an extended period of time. Future research that focuses
on continuity and change within a greater variety of social
relationships is necessary to examine the extent to which
associations between losses in social relationships and psy-
chological well-being are specific to particular dimensions
of well-being and domains of relationships.
In addition to highlighting the importance of relation-
ships with neighbors for eudaimonic well-being, results also
suggest that perceived support with neighbors is especially
salient in middle and later life. Although not an explicit
hypothesis of our study, results for eudaimonic well-being
provided evidence for perceived support as a mediator of
the associations between contact and well-being, given that
associations between perceived support and eudaimonic
well-being accounted for the associations between contact
and eudaimonic well-being. These results suggest that con-
tinuously low levels of contact with neighbors is associated
with eudaimonic well-being because these participants have
less perceived support from neighbors.
Findings for the relatively greater importance of per-
ceived support in comparison with contact are consistent
with findings from prior studies that have examined other
outcomes. For example, Shaw (2005) found that anticipated
support from neighbors, but not contact, was predictive of
fewer physical limitations. This pattern of results might be
explained by the differences between social processes versus
structure. Whereas contact is a structural aspect of social rela-
tionships, perceived support is a process, which explains how
the relationship was developed, how it is maintained, and its
demands (House, Umberson, & Landis, 1988). Processual
aspects of social relationships are likely important elements
of the pathways through which relationships with neighbors
influence adults' psychological well-being over time.
Despite the strengths of this study, including its use of
longitudinal national U.S. data, limitations render some of
its conclusions as tentative. For one, our sample consisted
of mainly white and highly educated people. This lack
of diversity limits our ability to generalize these findings
across more racially/ethnic and socioeconomically diverse
populations. Given prior studies' findings on racial/ethnic
differences in the experiences of neighbor relationships
(Bjornstrom, 2011; Cornwell, Laumann, & Schumm, 2008;
Taylor et al., 2001), examining the implications of neighbor
relationships in middle and later life with more racially/eth-
nically diverse samples is essential.
Furthermore, for the sake of analytic parsimony, this
study examined relationships with neighbors independent
of many factors that are associated with adults' psychologi-
cal well-being, such as educational status, age, and func-
tional limitations. Given the lack of available measures, we
also were unable to test subgroup differences by commu-
nity characteristics, such as urban versus rural, which has
been the focus of some prior research (Mair & Thivierge-
Rikard, 2010). Future studies guided by theory and research
615
Greenfield and Reyes
on potential subgroup differences in neighbor relationships
are necessary to address questions regarding the conditions
under which neighbor relationships matter the most. One
particularly important direction for such research is to draw
upon social network techniques to examine how neighbor
relationships might influence individual well-being in the
context of other potentially salient social relationships (see
Fiori, Antonucci, & Cortina, 2006). Such research might
consider not only primary ties with family and friends but
also more peripheral social relationships, such as those with
coworkers, service providers, leisure partners, and co-con-
gregants (Fingerman, 2009).
Another limitation was the items used to measure per-
ceived support from neighbors. Given the secondary nature
of the analysis, our study only had two questions availa-
ble to measure this construct, which limited the reliability
of this measure specifically. We also lacked the ability to
measure the quality of contact (both positive and negative
interactions) and received support, which previous studies
have found to be associated with psychological well-being
in ways that differ from overall contact and perceived sup-
port (Thoits, 2011; Uchino, 2009).
Finally, although this study used longitudinal data over a
10-year period, it presents correlations between changes in
neighbor relationships and changes in psychological well-
being. It is possible that declining levels of well-being pre-
cede changes in relationships with neighbors (e.g., declining
levels of well-being cause losses in perceived support and
contact with neighbors), making it infeasible for this study
alone to completely separate processes of causation from
selection. Also, systematic differences in longitudinal attri-
tion might bias the figures presented in this study (see
Radler & Ryff, 2010, for a full discussion of attrition in the
MIDUS study).
Despite these limitations, findings provide support, in
part, for current initiatives that focus on developing strong
relationships among neighbors to promote well-being in
later life. In addition to specific neighborhood-based aging
services program models--such as the Village model and
NORC programs (e.g., Greenfield et al., 2012)--leading
frameworks for age-friendly communities emphasize the
importance of opportunities for older adults' social par-
ticipation and inclusion in activities with other community
members (Fitzgerald & Caro, 2013). Results of this study
suggest the need to foster more supportive neighborhoods
where contact among neighbors is not only frequent but also
supportive and fostered over time. Findings also indicate
that enhancing relationships among neighbors is especially
promising for optimizing developmental aspects of adults'
psychological well-being. Continuing to advance research
on the diverse processes and contexts through which neigh-
bor relationships influence individual outcomes will help
to better fulfill the promise of these relatively overlooked
relationships as a potential resource for aging individuals
and society.
