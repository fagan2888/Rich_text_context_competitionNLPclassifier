Results From the Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of
the Elderly

In previous research on cognitive decline among older adults, investigators have not considered the potential
impact of contextual variables, such as neighborhood-level conditions. In the present investigation, the authors
examined the association between 2 neighborhood-context variables--socioeconomic status and percentage of
Mexican-American residents--and individual-level cognitive function over a 5-year follow-up period (1993­1998).
Data were obtained from the Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly, a longitu-
dinal study of community-dwelling older Mexican Americans (n ¼ 3,050) residing in the southwestern United
States. Individual records were linked with 1990 US Census tract data, which provided information on neighbor-
hood characteristics. Hierarchical linear growth-curve models and hierarchical logistic models were used to ex-
amine relations between individual- and neighborhood-level variables and the rate and incidence of cognitive
decline. Results showed that baseline cognitive function and rates of cognitive decline varied significantly across
US Census tracts. Respondents living in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods experienced significantly
faster rates of cognitive decline than those in more advantaged neighborhoods. Odds of incident cognitive decline
decreased as a function of neighborhood percentage of Mexican-American residents and increased with neighbor-
hood economic disadvantage. The authors conclude that neighborhood context is associated with late-life cogni-
tive function and that the effects are independent of individual-level risk factors.

Understanding the cognitive health of older adults is of
major scientific importance and is essential to both public
health planning and health-care practice. Previous research
on cognition has focused on individual-level characteristics
as risk or protective factors for cognitive decline, rarely con-
sidering the potential impact of contextual variables, such as
neighborhood-level conditions. Neighborhoods have emerged
as an important context for physical health and well-being
(1­4) and may also be important for cognitive health (5­8).
A growing body of research has documented the effects
of neighborhood-level characteristics on individual health.
Neighborhood socioeconomic context, in particular, has been
identified as a salient characteristic with regard to health out-
comes (4). With few exceptions (9, 10), investigators have
reported significant associations between neighborhood so-
cioeconomic deprivation and increased mortality (11­13),
negative health behaviors (14, 15), increased rates of cardio-
vascular disease, lower self-rated health, and higher body
mass index, independent of individual-level risk factors (4).
Few studies have explored the effects of neighborhood
context on cognitive function in adults, and to our knowl-
edge none have examined the relations longitudinally.

Nevertheless, available evidence suggests that the contexts
in which people live may be related to their level of cogni-
tive functioning. For example, using data from a large, na-
tionally representative study of older US adults, Wight et al.
(5) reported that higher neighborhood-level educational at-
tainment was associated with better cognitive function, net
of individual-level socioeconomic status, demographic fac-
tors, and health status. Recently, Lang et al. (16) found that
neighborhood deprivation was independently associated
with worse cognitive performance on the Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) (17) in women and men aged 70 years
or more and women younger than age 70 years.
Neighborhood context may be more salient to certain
subgroups of the population, since age, sex, and race/
ethnicity appear to affect the level and impact of exposure
to neighborhood environments (3). Older adults often have
greater exposure to their neighborhood environments via
longer length of residence and less participation in activities
outside the community, and they may be more dependent on
community resources than younger age groups (3). Minority
populations, such as Hispanics, are inordinately exposed to
impoverished neighborhood conditions. Compared with 9%
of whites, 40% of Hispanics reside in areas where the pov-
erty rate exceeds 20% (18). Among adults aged 65 years or
more, approximately 20% of Hispanics are poor as com-
pared with 8% of non-Hispanic whites (19).
Several recent studies have indicated that in addition to
neighborhood socioeconomic context, the relative concen-
tration of Hispanics in a neighborhood may be relevant for
the health of Hispanic residents. In particular, these studies
report health benefits associated with residence in ethnically
homogeneous neighborhoods, including higher self-rated
health (20), lower odds of stroke, cancer, and hip fracture
(21), lower risk of mortality (21­23), fewer depressive
symptoms (24, 25), and healthier dietary habits (26). Gen-
erally, these studies focused on ``Hispanics,'' who differ in
region of origin, migration patterns, and cultural values and
experiences. However, Mexican Americans, the largest
Hispanic subpopulation, comprised the majority of each
sample. Three studies (20, 21, 24) included only Mexican
Americans and examined the health effects of neighborhood
concentration of Mexican Americans in particular.
In the present investigation, we examined the association
between 2 neighborhood-context variables--socioeconomic
status and percentage of Mexican-American residents--and
cognitive function over a 5-year follow-up period, using
data from a longitudinal study of community-dwelling older
Mexican Americans. We hypothesized that poor socioeco-
nomic context would be associated with worse baseline
cognitive function and a higher rate of cognitive decline,
while greater neighborhood ethnic homogeneity would be
associated with better baseline cognitive function and would
be protective against cognitive decline.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample
Data were obtained from the Hispanic Established Pop-
ulations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (Hispanic
EPESE), a panel study of Mexican-American adults aged 65
years or more. A more complete description of the rationale
and methods of the Hispanic EPESE has been published
previously (27). The baseline cohort of 3,050 adults was
selected from 5 southwestern states in 1993­1994, using
multistage area cluster probability sampling, with 1990
US Census tracts serving as the primary sampling units.
Follow-up interviews were conducted during 1995­1996,
1998­1999, 2000­2001, and 2004­2005.
In the present investigation, we used the first 3 waves of
the Hispanic EPESE, since 1990 US Census tract data pro-
vided information on neighborhood characteristics. Of the
original 3,050 respondents, 2,438 were reinterviewed dur-
ing wave 2 (1995­1996). At the 5-year follow-up, 661 of
the original 3,050 respondents were deceased, 285 were
lost to follow-up, and 124 refused to be reinterviewed.
Thus, 1,980 respondents remained in the study at wave 3
(1998­1999).
Dependent variable
Cognitive function was measured using English and
Spanish versions of the MMSE, which were adopted from
the Diagnostic Interview Schedule used in prior community
surveys (28). The MMSE is a commonly used brief measure
of cognitive status in studies of older adults (17), and it
appears to be a valid indicator of cognitive impairment in
both non-Hispanic white and Mexican-American samples
(8). The Spanish version of the MMSE has met standard
criteria for the development of translated tests and has been
successfully implemented in community surveys of Mexi-
can Americans (29). Respondents who were interviewed by
proxy were counted as missing; however, if the proxy was
used because of mental/cognitive incapacity, the respondent
was given a score of 0 and retained in the analyses.
Respondents who could not answer 1 or more MMSE ques-
tions because of physical limitations such as deafness,
blindness, or arthritis were excluded from the analyses.
Thus, estimates were based on a total of 2,851 participants
at baseline (wave 1; 1993­1994), 2,258 at wave 2 (1995­
1996), and 1,876 at wave 3 (1998­1999).
Independent variables
Neighborhood characteristics. US Census tracts were
used as proxies for neighborhood environments. Census
tracts are small geographic areas within counties that are
designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to pop-
ulation characteristics, socioeconomic status, and living
conditions. Census tracts contain an average population of
4,000 people and vary in geographic size depending on the
population density of the area (e.g., urban settings vs. rural
settings) (30). Records for individual respondents were
linked with 1990 US Census data (Summary Tape File 3A
(31)) for the 208 tracts in which respondents lived at base-
line. The median length of residence in the household
and neighborhood was 18 years in 1993­1994, and over
70% of respondents had lived at their current residence for
10 or more years, implying residential stability among
respondents.
Neighborhoods and Cognitive Decline 1093
Am J Epidemiol 2009;169:1092­1101
To capture multiple dimensions of neighborhood socio-
economic status, we conducted an exploratory factor anal-
ysis on the 208 census tracts using 14 census tract indicators
representing education, occupational class, poverty, hous-
ing, and income. Results yielded a 2-factor solution explain-
ing 82% of the common variance. One factor was labeled
``economic advantage'' because poverty, income, and hous-
ing items loaded highly and higher scores reflected higher
economic standing. The other factor was labeled ``social
disadvantage'' because education and occupational class
items loaded highly and higher scores reflected lower social
standing. The correlation between the 2 factors was À0.35.
In preliminary analyses, factor scores were not linearly re-
lated to MMSE score; therefore, they were coded into quar-
tiles for use in hierarchical linear models.
In addition to neighborhood socioeconomic status, a mea-
sure of neighborhood ethnic homogeneity was used in the
analyses. The percentage of neighborhood residents whowere
Mexican or Mexican-American (i.e., ``percent Mexican-
American'') was used as a continuous variable with values
ranging from 0 to 1.
Individual-level covariates. Models were adjusted for
individual-level sociodemographic measures, including age
at baseline, sex (female vs. male), marital status (married vs.
not married), and nativity status (US-born vs. foreign-born).
The highest level of education completed (<5 years or 5­11
years vs. >11 years), annual household income (<$5,000,
$5,000­$9,999, or $10,000­$14,999 vs. !$15,000), and oc-
cupation were used as individual-level measures of socioeco-
nomic status. Respondents with missing data on income or
education were retained in the analyses, and missing-data
status was entered as a category in all models. Respondents
were asked what kind of work they had performed during
most of their lives,and their work experiencewas categorized
into 1 of 6 occupational classes based on 1990 US Census
classifications (32): professional/sales (reference group), ser-
vice, farming, skilled crafts/repair, manual labor, or never
worked/homemaker. Analyses were also adjusted for
health conditions often associated with cognitive decline--
depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale (33); (continuous variable) and self-
reported physician-diagnosed diabetes mellitus and stroke.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive analysis included the use of t tests, analysis of
variance, and Pearson correlations to examine bivariate
associations between cognitive function and independent
variables. The cross-sectional associations between neigh-
borhood characteristics and cognitive function at baseline
were measured using 2-level hierarchical linear models with
random intercepts, designed such that respondents were
nested within the 208 neighborhoods in which they resided
(34). Multilevel analyses allowed for the examination of
within- and between-neighborhood variability in MMSE
scores and the extent to which between-neighborhood var-
iance was accounted for by individual- or neighborhood-
level characteristics.
Cognitive decline was assessed using 2 methods of
data analysis. The first approach estimated individual- and
neighborhood-level cognitive function trajectories, or
``growth'' curves, using 3-level hierarchical linear models
(34). The 3 occasions of measurement of cognitive function
(level 1) were nested within individuals (level 2), who were
nested within neighborhoods (level 3). At level 1, each in-
dividual participant's MMSE scores over the 3 waves of data
collection were modeled as a function of time (years since
baseline). The intercept(s) (baseline cognitive status) and
slope(s) (yearly rate of decline in cognitive function) were
specified as random at levels 2 and 3. Level 2 in the model
included the individual-level predictors of cognitive func-
tion and decline, and level 3 included neighborhood-level
predictors.
The second approach employed a dichotomous measure
of cognitive decline, created using a cutoff based on the
distribution of scores from the sample itself. Participants
were considered to have experienced cognitive decline if
their MMSE scores decreased by 3 or more points (median
change) from wave 1 to wave 3. Logistic regression models
were fitted using hierarchical generalized linear modeling.
The models estimated odds ratios for the relation between
baseline individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics
and cognitive decline at wave 3.
In all analyses, continuous individual- and neighborhood-
level variables were centered at the grand mean for estima-
tion and interpretation purposes. The inferential statistics
presented here were estimated using robust standard errors
produced by hierarchical linear models, because they are
somewhat tolerant of violations of hierarchical linear mod-
eling assumptions (34). Analyses were performed using the
statistical software packages HLM, version 6.04 (35), and
SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
Tests of statistical significance were 2-sided.
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics
Table 1 presents individual- and neighborhood-level
sample characteristics at baseline and bivariate associa-
tions between cognitive function and explanatory vari-
ables. The majority of participants in the sample were
female, with a mean age of 73 years, and most were cur-
rently married. Mean scores on the MMSE were 24.70,
23.44, and 21.05 at waves 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and
959 respondents had a score that declined by !3 points
(data not shown). At the neighborhood level, the average
census tract was approximately 60% Mexican-American,
but values ranged from 10% to 96%. Most of the sample
lived in economically and socially disadvantaged neigh-
borhoods. Cognitive function was significantly associated
with age, nativity, marital status, education, occupation,
income, depressive symptoms, stroke, and economic and
social factors.
Explanatory models
Table 2 presents results from hierarchical linear models
relating individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics
to baseline cognitive function. There was significant random
1094 Sheffield and Peek
Am J Epidemiol 2009;169:1092­1101
variation in cognitive function across neighborhoods, such
that 16% of the variance in baseline cognitive function could
be attributed to living in different neighborhoods. Individual-
level characteristics accounted for 31% of the level-1
within-group variance. Lower education, older age, lower
income, having diabetes, having more depressive symp-
toms, and having suffered a stroke were associated with
poorer cognitive function. Female sex was positively asso-
ciated with cognitive function. Respondents who were
homemakers or unemployed had poorer cognitive function
than those who worked in professional/sales careers. Neigh-
borhood percent Mexican-American and the neighborhood
socioeconomic factors were not significantly associated
with baseline cognitive function.
Table 3 presents estimates from hierarchical linear
growth-curve models of cognitive function over the 5-year
follow-up period. The multiplicative terms indicate the
extent to which predictors were associated with slopes of
cognitive decline. The ``year slope'' estimate shows that
MMSE scores significantly decreased over time at a rate of
0.77 points per year. The random effects in model 1 in-
dicate that approximately 19% of the variance in rates of
cognitive decline could be attributed to living in different
neighborhoods. Older age and having more depressive
symptoms at baseline were significantly associated with
faster rates of decline. Neighborhood percent Mexican-
American was marginally associated with cognitive de-
cline. People living in more ethnically homogeneous
neighborhoods experienced somewhat slower rates of de-
cline. Cognitive decline was more severe among persons
living in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. For
example, those in the lowest quartile of neighborhood eco-
nomic advantage declined cognitively, on average, À0.28
points per year faster than those in the highest quartile of
advantage. Neighborhood social disadvantage was not as-
sociated with rate of cognitive decline. Together, neigh-
borhood percent Mexican-American and neighborhood
economic advantage explained 10.5% of the between-
neighborhood variance in rate of decline.
Figure 1 displays cognitive growth curves over time by
quartile of economic advantage. Explanatory variables and
covariates not included in the graph were held constant at
the mean.
Multilevel logistic regression models predicting the
odds of decline (!3 points) at wave 3 are presented in
Table 4. Having less than 5 years of education, being older
at baseline, having more depressive symptoms, and having
had a stroke were associated with higher odds of incident
cognitive decline. Increasing neighborhood percentage of
Mexican-American residents was associated with reduced
odds of cognitive decline (odds ratio ¼ 0.33, 95% confi-
dence interval: 0.12, 0.88). Neighborhood economic dis-
advantage was associated with increased odds of cognitive
decline. For example, persons living in neighborhoods at
the lowest quartile of economic advantage had signifi-
cantly higher odds of decline than those living in the most
economically advantaged neighborhoods (odds ratio ¼
1.75, 95% confidence interval: 1.07, 2.88). Again, neigh-
borhood social disadvantage was not associated with the
odds of cognitive decline.

Analysis of attrition
Predictors of incomplete data were examined using hi-
erarchical logistic regression to investigate the effects of
death or loss to follow-up on the reported results. Depres-
sive symptoms, older age at baseline, diabetes, and stroke
were associated with increased odds of death or dropout by
wave 3, while female sex and being married were associ-
ated with decreased odds. Respondents with lower MMSE
scores at baseline were more likely to die or drop out,
which was expected. However, neighborhood percentage
of Mexican-American residents and neighborhood eco-
nomic disadvantage were negatively but nonsignificantly
associated with death or loss to follow-up by wave 3, which
suggests that reported associations between neighbor-
hood variables and cognition are not due to selectively
high death or loss to follow-up of respondents from
economically disadvantaged or ethnically homogeneous
neighborhoods.
Although the effects presented in Table 3 were based on
data from all 2,851 respondents, persons with complete data
were given more weight than those with incomplete data.
We investigated whether there were systematic differences
in individual growth curves between participants with and
without complete data, excluding from analysis respondents
with only 1 wave of data. Compared with persons who had
complete data at wave 3, respondents who died or were lost
to follow-up had significantly lower baseline MMSE scores,
but they did not have faster rates of cognitive decline. More-
over, adjusting the growth-curve model for respondent sta-
tus at wave 3 (complete vs. deceased or lost to follow-up)
did not attenuate the associations between neighborhood
variables and cognitive decline.
Sensitivity analyses
We performed sensitivity analyses to test the robustness
of the observed associations. Incident decline analyses were
repeated using alternate cutoff points for the dichotomous
measure of decline. Results were robust to a cutoff of
4 points; however, when we used a cutoff of 7 points (75th
percentile of decline), percent Mexican-American was no
longer statistically significant. We repeated all longitudinal
analyses after excluding persons who were impaired at base-
line (MMSE score < 18; n ¼ 152), and the results were
substantively equivalent to the previous results, indicating
that the observed associations were not being driven by
persons who were cognitively impaired at baseline.
DISCUSSION
The present study provides evidence that neighborhood
context is associated with cognitive decline among older
Mexican-American adults. The findings of the study were
several-fold. First, there was significant variation in baseline
cognitive function and rates of cognitive decline across neigh-
borhoods, even after adjustment for individual-level charac-
teristics. Second, older adults living in areas with higher
percentages of Mexican Americans were slightly better off
cognitively than those living in areas less populated by
Mexican Americans, ceteris paribus. Third, neighborhood
economic disadvantage was associated with increased rate
and risk of cognitive decline. Finally, neighborhood ethnic
homogeneity and economic disadvantage explained more
than 10% of the between-neighborhood variance in decline,
or approximately 2% of the total variance in cognitive decline.
There are a number of potential pathways through which
neighborhoods may influence cognitive health. Neighbor-
hoods represent the daily context and quality of life experi-
enced by residents in terms of a number of factors, including
social interactions and cultural climate, psychosocial and
physical stressors, lifestyle, and availability of personal
and institutional resources (8). Wight et al. (5) suggested
that socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods may
have more stressors and fewer physical and social resources,
thus inhibiting participation in both physical and social ac-
tivities, which have been linked to better cognitive function-
ing (5, 36, 37). Such neighborhoods also may have fewer
cognitively stimulating resources (e.g., bookstores, librar-
ies). In addition to these pathways, it is likely that some
of the cognitive impact of neighborhood socioeconomic
context is routed through its effects on health-related risk
factors for cognitive decline, such as cardiovascular disease
(38), stroke, increased blood pressure (14), diabetes (39),
and functional decline (40).
Neighborhood economic advantage was related to cogni-
tive decline, while neighborhood social disadvantage was not,
an observation that could provide insight into the pathways
through which neighborhoods influence cognitive functioning
in older adults. The economic advantage factor may represent
a better proxy for specific neighborhood conditions and re-
sources relevant to cognitive decline in this sample. We as-
sessed the individual effects of the census indicators
composing the factor, and ``median value of owned homes''

erty values are an indicator of the desirability and economic
stability of a neighborhood, and are positively associated with
rates of home ownership and percentage of residents living in
an area for more than 5 years (41). The specific mechanisms
linking neighborhoods and cognitive health are probably

complex and remain unclear. However, establishing that res-
idence in an economically disadvantaged neighborhood is
related to cognitive decline is the first step toward drawing
causal inferences and developing interventions to prevent or
reduce cognitive decline.
Ethnically homogeneous Mexican-American neigh-
borhoods may confer sociocultural advantages to their
residents. Mexican Americans may benefit from the psy-
chosocial resources, social organization and control, pres-
ervation of culture, and healthful traditional behavioral
norms often found in neighborhoods populated by other
Mexican Americans (20, 21, 24, 26). In addition, Mexican-
American neighborhoods have relatively high rates of
labor force participation, intact family structures, home
ownership, and residential stability, despite being socio-
economically disadvantaged (42, 43). However, as the rap-
idly expanding Mexican-American population in the
United States moves into more assimilated but still disad-
vantaged areas, the risk of cognitive decline and other
health conditions in this group may increase.
This study had several strengths and limitations of note.
Analyses were adjusted for a number of individual-level cor-
relates of cognitive function and decline. Nevertheless, it is
possible that the observed associations reflected unmeasured
variables. This study employed a large probability sample
of older Mexican Americans, which enhances the generaliz-
ability of the findings to the larger population of Mexican
Americans in the southwestern United States. We used longi-
tudinal analyses to examine the relation between baseline
characteristics and cognitive decline, which helped to estab-
lish temporality of association. However, the analyses did not
include any time-varying predictors that might have helped
explain age-related changes in cognitive function. Selection
effects may have been operating in these analyses, since the
sample participants were aged !65 years at baseline. Finally,
census tracts are imperfect proxies for neighborhood bound-
aries and may not represent neighborhood areas as they are
perceived by residents. Additionally, the strength of associa-
tions between neighborhood characteristics and individual
outcomes may vary according to size of the neighborhood
proxy, since larger geographic areas tend to be more hetero-
geneous (44). Nevertheless, census tracts have been shown to
be reasonable approximations of neighborhoods (45), and
several studies have indicated that census tracts and smaller
geographic units known as block groups perform similarly,
with relatively small differences in results (44, 46, 47).
The present study has provided evidence that neighbor-
hood ethnic homogeneity and socioeconomic context are
relevant to cognitive decline among older Mexican Ameri-
cans. The neighborhood effects observed in this study were
independent of individual-level characteristics, indicating
that the contextual effect was not simply the result of com-
positional differences among neighborhoods. These findings
add to existing literature indicating that context matters for
cognition, as well as the more general literature concerning
neighborhood effects on health. More research is warranted
to determine whether and to what extent context matters for
cognitive decline among other racial/ethnic groups in vari-
ous neighborhood environments. Community interventions
that provide high-risk areas with physical, social, and cog-
nitively stimulating resources may be an effective means of
reducing the negative cognitive impact of living in a disad-
vantaged environment, in addition to improving the quality
of life for all residents.
