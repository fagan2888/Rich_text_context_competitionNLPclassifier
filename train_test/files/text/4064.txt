Introduction
Neotrombicula autumnalis (Acari: Trombiculidae) mites,
also called harvest mites or chigger mites, are considered
as the most frequent causative agents of trombiculiasis
in people and animals.1­3 The larval stage is the sole par-
asitic stage and individuals become infested from the
outdoor environment. Harvest mite life cycle is poorly
understood. Larvae have a seasonal activity, mainly
between September and November.4 However, in some
countries, particular favourable climatic conditions may
allow more than one complete life cycle in a year and
larvae might be found during extra periods.3 In cats,
along with the presence of firmly attached mites, visible
to the naked eye as characteristic orange spots, it is pos-
sible to observe erythema, papules and crusts, mostly on
the ear margins, face, interdigital spaces and ventral
abdomen.3 Cats can be highly pruritic; however, some
individuals can host high numbers of mites without
showing any lesions or signs of discomfort.3 Seasonality
of the infestation and absence of experimental models
may explain, at least partially, the lack of licensed prod-
ucts on the market. Previous studies have shown efficacy
when treated with systemic selamectin5,6 or fipronil
spray directly applied on the infested body areas every 2
weeks.3,7

Abstract
Objectives Few data are available concerning therapeutic aspects of feline trombiculiasis. This study evaluated
the efficacy of a 10% w/v fipronil-based spot-on solution in 15 cats with natural Neotrombicula species infestation.
Methods Ten cats received 1 drop per affected site on day (D)0 and D14, with the rest of the 0.5 ml pipette applied
on the skin between the shoulders. Five cats served as non-treated controls. Parasite score (0 = absent; 3 = severe,
>10 parasites/zone) was assessed on D0, D14 and D28 on all animals. Skin lesions (SCORing Feline Allergic
Dermatitis lesion severity scale [SCORFAD]) and investigator pruritus scale (IPS; 0 = cat comfortable, grooming like
any normal cat; 4 = cat uncomfortable, pruritic all the time) were assessed on treated cats on the same days. Global
assessment of efficacy, tolerance and ease of use (GAS; 1 = very poor; 5 = excellent) was assessed on D28.
Results All the cats completed the study. Parasite scores of the control cats were maintained throughout the trial
(mean ± SD: D0 4 ± 0.7, D14 3.2 ± 1.1 and D28 3.2 ± 0.4). In treated cats, SCORFAD (D0 3.2 ± 5.4, D14 1.1 ±
2.1 [P <0.002] and D28 0.5 ± 1.3 [P <0.002]), parasite (D0 3.9 ± 1.3, D14 1.2 ± 0.8 [P <0.005] and D28 0.4 ±
0.5 [P <0.005]) and IPS (D0 1 ± 1.2, D14 0.5 ± 1.1 [P <0.05] and D28 0.3 ± 0.7 [P <0.05]) scores significantly
decreased throughout the trial. On D28, the GAS was 4.2 ± 0.9. There were no adverse effects from treatment.
Conclusions and relevanceThe 10% w/v fipronil preparation appeared to be effective, safe and practical in the
treatment of localised Neotrombicula species infestation in these cats.

The purpose of the present study was to assess the
efficacy of a 10% w/v fipronil-based spot-on solution
(Effipro 50 mg spot-on solution for cats; Virbac) in cats
naturally infested with N autumnalis.
Materials and methods
Fifteen client-owned cats, living outdoors or with out-
door access, were recruited in the south west of France.
Both owner consent and approval from the university's
ethics committee were obtained prior to beginning the
study. Inclusion criteria were the presence of N autumna-
lis mites on day 0 (D0) and the absence of change in the
lifestyle of the cat for the duration of the study. As trom-
biculiasis is a seasonal skin disease, five cats living in dif-
ferent households, but in the same geographical areas,
were included in parallel and left untreated, serving
as sentinels to ensure that the tested population would
be exposed to potential re-infestations throughout the
study. Control cats were selected with few or no skin
lesions. Exclusion criteria included cats younger than
2 months of age or weighing <1 kg, cats with a systemic
illness or condition that could deteriorate within the fol-
lowing month, and cats with signs or history of allergic
skin diseases. Cats that had received an acaricidal treat-
ment within the previous 6 weeks were also excluded.
The study consisted of three visits. Parasitological and
dermatological evaluations were conducted on the day of
inclusion (D0), day 14 (D14; ± 2 days) and day 28 (D28; ±
2 days) or closing visit for all treated cats; control cats
were only assessed for parasitic score. Each case was
evaluated by the same investigator throughout the study.
Parasite score (PS) was assessed on each body area with a
magnifying lens, on a 0­3 scale (0 = absence; 1 = mild,
1­5 parasites/area; 2 = moderate, 6­10 parasites/area;
3 = severe, >10 parasites/area). Skin lesions were scored
according to the SCORing Feline Allergic Dermatitis
lesion severity scale (SCORFAD), a scoring system used
previously.8,9 The SCORFAD is a numerical rating scoring
system to assess the severity of excoriations, miliary der-
matitis, eosinophilic plaques and self-induced alopecia in
each of 10 body regions, resulting in a total lesion score of
0­16 per region. Each lesion type was numerically scored
independently on a 0­4 scale (0 = none; 1 = very mild;
2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe). The 10 body regions
evaluated were the head, neck, dorsal and lateral thorax,
rump and tail, flanks, sternum and axilla, abdomen, peri-
neum, forelimbs and paws, hindlimbs and paws. The
investigator evaluated the intensity of pruritus on a 0­4
scale (investigator pruritus score [IPS]; 0 = the cat was
comfortable, grooming like any normal cat; 1 = the cat
was grooming, but it was tolerable and the cat remained
calm; 2 = the cat was grooming, but it was generally tol-
erable; 3 = the cat was grooming quite often; the cat was
uncomfortable, nervous or often agitated; 4 = the cat was
uncomfortable, grooming all the time) on each visit.
Global assessment of efficacy, tolerance and ease of use
(GAS; 1 = very poor; 5 = excellent) was assessed on D28
by the owner, independently of the investigator. PS, IPS
and GAS have previously been used internally for other
clinical studies although not in published studies.
Treatment was applied on D0 and D14 by the investi-
gator. One 0.5 ml Effipro 50 mg spot-on solution for cats
(fipronil 50 mg; Virbac) pipette was used per cat on each
day of treatment. One drop was applied on each affected
site. The rest was applied on the skin, in the neck region,
between the shoulders.
PS reduction was calculated at each time point (t)
using the arithmetic mean of PS according to the follow-
ing formula: PS reduction (%) = 100 × (mean day 0 ­
mean t)/mean day 0. Similarly, SCORFAD reduction and
IPS reduction were calculated using the same formula.
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare
data obtained on D14 and D28 with the baseline obtained
on day 0. Significance was defined as P <0.05. All statis-
tical analyses were performed using XLSTAT 2017-02
(Addinsoft SARL).
Results
All 15 cats completed the study. The first cat was included
on 4 October and the last one was included on 2
November. There were 10 females and five males aged
between 6 months and 12 years. No adverse effects was
observed.
Parasite scores (mean ± SD) of the control cats were
maintained throughout the study (4 ± 0.7 on D0, 3.2 ±
1.1 on D14 and 3.2 ± 0.4 on D28) allowing interpretation
of the results in the treated group.
On day 0, treated cats had a PS of 3.9 ± 1.3. On D14, it
was significantly reduced by 69% (P = 0.005); on D28,
the PS reduction was 90% (P = 0.005). On D28, six cats
were parasite-free; the other four had <5 harvest mites
on a single body area (Figure 1).
At inclusion, treated cats had a SCORFAD of 3.2 ±
5.4. On D14 it was significantly reduced by 66% (P =
0.02); on D28, it was reduced by 84% (P = 0.02).
Inclusion IPS was 1 ± 1.2. It was reduced by 50% on
day 14 (P = 0.04) and further reduced by 70% 2 weeks
later (P = 0.03).
Owners gave an average GAS of 4.2 ± 0.9 (minimum
2, maximum 5).
Discussion
This study confirms the efficacy of fipronil against
N autumnalis, which was previously reported with the
spray formulation.3,7 To the best of our knowledge, in
cats it is the first study with a spot-on solution. In dogs,
a line-on solution containing a permethrin­pyriproxyfen
combination was tested successfully on nine dogs.10 As
in the study by Nuttall et al,7 we elected to apply the
fipronil solution directly on the infested sites. This
Cadiergues et al 589
allowed a higher concentration of the active ingredient
in the sites where the parasites are attached. In most
cases, parasites were present in the interdigital spaces or
on the pinnal margins. After application of a spot-on for-
mulation on the skin between the shoulders, as recom-
mended on the summary of product characteristics, it is
expected that the product spreads at the body surface
and that the concentration is minimal at the most dis-
tanced body regions. Furthermore, these body regions
are classically groomed by cats, possibly over-groomed
if there is pruritus. Applying the product directly on the
parasitised areas ensures a direct efficacy on the para-
sites already attached and is expected to better prevent
re-infestations as mites seem to colonise one or few sites
on a given cat.3 The presence of the highest concentra-
tion of the product where the parasites are supposed to
attach is expected to prevent their attachment more rap-
idly and more efficiently.
The design of the pipette allows a precise, controlled
dose to be applied exactly where it is needed. A gentle
pressure on the body of the pipette releases the product
on the skin; when the pressure stops, the product stays
in the pipette without any dripping.
We elected to include a control group to ensure that
the cats receiving the treatment would be exposed to
harvest mites throughout the study. In the few studies
investigating an acaricidal activity against N autumnalis,
none had a control group.3,6,7 As trombiculiasis is a sea-
sonal parasitic disease, in the absence of a control group,
the absence of parasites on treated animals could be mis-
interpreted. In addition to living areas close to those of
treated cats, we based the selection of control cats on a
level of infestation similar to that of treated cats.
However, we found it to be more ethical to only select
control cats with few or no skin lesions as they would
remain untreated.
The SCORFAD index of treated cats both before and
after was low, considering that the maximum possible
score is 160. The SCORFAD index is adapted for cats
with allergic skin disease. Cats with trombiculiasis are
not necessarily allergic, which may explain the low score
of cats that were included. This clinical score is helpful as
it expresses the clinical improvement, as IPS does.
However, they remain secondary outcome criteria in this
study and should not be over-interpreted, particularly as
included cats were not very pruritic.
The product is licensed in cats for the treatment of flea
and tick infestations. The product has a persistent insec-
ticidal efficacy for up to 5 weeks against fleas and a per-
sistent acaricidal efficacy for up to 2 weeks against ticks.
In the current study, the product was applied twice at a
2 week interval, based on the approved tick indication in
Europe and on published results.7 All cats tolerated the
two applications well.
Conclusions
In the cats in the present study, the 10% w/v fipronil
preparation appeared to be effective, safe and practical
in the treatment of localised Neotrombicula species infes-
tation. Recommending the use of the product every
2 weeks from September to November in cats that suffer
from trombiculiasis is likely to help in controlling the
parasitic disease.
