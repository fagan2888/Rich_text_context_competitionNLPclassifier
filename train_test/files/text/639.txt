Purpose: The recent discovery of the HFE gene and its association with hereditary hemochromatosis has renewed
the attention directed to iron-overload diseases. Population screening for hereditary hemochromatosis is under
debate, and population-based estimates of morbidity associated with hereditary hemochromatosis are needed.
The purpose of this study is to estimate the number of hemochromatosis-associated hospitalizations in the United
States using a population-based dataset. Methods: National Hospital Discharge Survey and census data were
used to estimate hemochromatosis-associated hospitalization rates for persons 18 years of age and over.
Results: From 1979 through 1997, the rate of hemochromatosis-associated hospitalizations was 2.3 per 100,000
persons in the United States. The rate among persons 60 years of age and over increased more than 60% during
this time period. Conclusion: The increase in the rate of hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospitalizations
among older persons is consistent with recent trends in mortality data and may reflect the rising awareness of
iron-overload disorders in the United States. Genetics in Medicine, 2001:3(2):109­111.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disease of primary iron
overload. Complications of hereditary hemochromatosis in-
clude many common disorders e.g., cirrhosis, diabetes, cardiac
disease, hyperpigmentation of the skin, and arthritis. Once
thought to be rare, hereditary hemochromatosis is now under-
stood to be one of the most common genetic disorders among
the United States population. In 1996, a mutation identified in
the HFE gene was found to be associated with the majority of
hereditary hemochromatosis cases.1 Approximately 4 to 5 per
10,000 persons of European origin are homozygous for the
C282Y missense mutation;2 an estimated 1 in 10 persons of
northern European descent is a carrier. The estimated preva-
lence of hereditary hemochromatosis based on screening stud-
ies that use serum iron measures ranges from 2 to 5 per 1,000
persons.3
The identification of mutations in the HFE gene launched a
debate about population screening for hereditary hemochro-
matosis using genetic testing. Although hereditary hemochro-
matosis meets several of the World Health Organization's cri-
teria for screening (e.g., it can be detected before the onset of
symptoms, and its complications can be prevented through the
use of therapeutic phlebotomy), the justifiability of population
screening for hereditary hemochromatosis is questionable be-
cause its natural history is not well understood. The pheno-
typic expression of hereditary hemochromatosis varies and
most likely results from interactions between the genetic de-
fect, age, sex, and environmental modifiers.4 In addition, he-
reditary hemochromatosis is thought to be both underdiag-
nosed and under-reported. Cost-effectiveness of potential
screening programs cannot accurately be assessed without ad-
ditional information on the disease burden of hereditary
hemochromatosis at the population level. Databases and reg-
istries can provide such information.5 For this study, we ana-
lyzed data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey
(NHDS) for 1979 through 1997 to estimate one measure of
hemochromatosis-associated morbidity: the rate of hereditary
hemochromatosis-associated hospitalizations in the United
States.
METHODS
The NHDS is a population-based sample survey used to es-
timate inpatient utilization of short-stay, nonfederal hospitals
in the United States.6 The NHDS data files for 1979 through
1997 contain demographic information for over 4 million
(non-newborn) hospitalizations. The NHDS data files also in-
clude up to seven International Classification of Diseases, 9th
Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM) diagnoses per
record. Each record is weighted to allow for inflation to na-
tional estimates. We selected all records that contained code
275.0 (disorders of iron metabolism, including hemochroma-
tosis). We excluded records of persons 18 years of age to

remove potential cases of pediatric hemochromatosis. We also
removed records with ICD9-CM codes consistent with sec-
ondary iron overload diseases.7 These codes included: 273.8
(hereditary atransferrinemia), 277.1 (porphyria cutanea
tarda), 282.0 (hereditary spherocytosis), 282.1 (hereditary el-
liptocytosis), 282.3 (other hemolytic anemias due to enzyme
deficiency), 282.4 (thalassemia), 282.5 (sickle cell trait), 282.6
(sickle cell anemias including 282.61 and 282.62), 282.7 (other
hemoglobinopathies), 282.8 (other specified hemolytic ane-
mias), 282.9 (hereditary hemolytic anemia), 284.0 (aplastic
anemia), 284.8 (other specified aplastic anemias), 284.9 (un-
specified aplastic anemia), 285.0 (sideroblastic anemia), 285.8
(congential dyserythropoietic anemia), 285.9 (unspecified
anemias), and 964.0 (iron poisoning). The remaining records
were considered "hereditary hemochromatosis-associated
hospitalizations."
The U.S. Census Bureau population estimates for each year
are included with the NHDS documentation file. We com-
puted annual hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospital
utilization rates per 100,000 U.S. residents by using these pop-
ulation estimates as denominators. We calculated age-specific
hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospitalization rates
for the following age groups: 18­39 years, 40­59 years, and 60
years and over.
The NHDS utilizes a stratified, multistage probability de-
sign. This complex sampling design requires special consider-
ation for presentation of estimates and imposes limitations
when standard errors are calculated for multiple-year esti-
mates. Guidelines for reporting estimates and calculating stan-
dard errors are included in the NHDS data documentation.6
Briefly, if the sample size is 60 or more and the relative standard
error is 30%, the estimate may be reported. The relative stan-
dard error for multiple-year estimates can be determined only
if the relative standard error for each single-year estimate
within the year group is also computable. Thus, if a multiple-
year estimate contains individual annual sample sizes 60, the
relative standard error cannot be determined with certainty.
RESULTS
For the period 1979 through 1997, the NHDS contains over
3.5 million records for persons 18 years of age or older; only
675 of these records listed ICD9-CM code 275.0 among the
diagnoses. Of these, 171 also listed diagnostic codes for second-
ary iron overload diseases, of which thalassemias and anemias
were most frequent. After removing these records, 504 records
remained for hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospi-
talizations. Application of the analytical weights yielded an es-
timated 79,580 hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospi-
talizations. Among these hospitalizations, code 275.0
accounted for 22% of the primary diagnoses. The primary di-
agnoses among the remaining 88% of records varied widely;
diagnoses for diseases of the liver and heart were the most
common (Table 1). Diabetes was less common as a primary
diagnosis than as a codiagnosis. The mean age of patients with
hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospitalizations was
age 62 years; 92% were white and 62% were male.
The hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospitaliza-
tion rate among U.S. residents for 1979­1997 was 2.3 per
100,000. Estimated annual rates were in the unreportable
range because of small sample sizes (see Methods section).
Thus, we collapsed the data into the following multiple-year
groups: 1979­1982, 1983­1987, 1988­1992, and 1993­1997.
We analyzed the hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hos-
pitalization rates for each of these groups separately by age and
sex. Persons 60 years of age and over had the highest rates of
hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospitalization; from
1979 through 1997, the rate in this group increased over 60%,
from 5.4 per 100,000 U.S. residents during 1979­1982, to 8.0
during 1993­1997 (Table 2). Males had a consistently higher
rate of hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospitaliza-
tion, particularly in the oldest age group: 8.9 per 100,000 U.S.
male residents compared with 4.4 per 100,000 U.S. female res-
idents 60 years of age and older.
When we stratified the sample by both age and sex, males 60
years of age and over were the only group with a sample size
sufficient for reportable estimates. Among this group, the he-
reditary hemochromatosis-associated hospitalization rate in-
creased from 8.4 per 100,000 during 1979­1982 to 11.3 per
100,000 during 1993­1997. The confidence intervals for these
multiple-year estimates are not reported because of the lack of

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
From 1979 through 1997, hereditary hemochromatosis was
rarely diagnosed among hospitalized U.S. residents. Preva-
lence surveys suggest that 2 to 5 per 1,000 people have heredi-
tary hemochromatosis, yet we observed a hereditary hemo-
chromatosis-associated hospitalization rate of approximately
2 per 100,000. Although a direct comparison cannot be made,
these findings suggest that either people with hereditary hemo-
chromatosis infrequently require hospitalization or that phy-
sicians underdiagnose or under-report hemochromatosis, or
both. The most frequent codiagnoses among the estimated
79,580 hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospitaliza-
tions were diseases of the heart, liver, and joints, and diabetes.
Although these diseases are among the principal end-stage
complications of hereditary hemochromatosis, each was diag-
nosed during 10% of hospitalizations.
Using the NHDS to quantify hemochromatosis-associated
morbidity in the United States has additional limitations. First,
hospitalizations are only one measure of morbidity and do not
represent a complete assessment of the disease burden associ-
ated with hemochromatosis. Of the people who develop symp-
toms as a result of hereditary hemochromatosis, only a subset
will see a doctor and be hospitalized. Of those people who are
hospitalized, only a subset will be diagnosed correctly with
hereditary hemochromatosis as the underlying cause of their
symptoms, because the clinical conditions resulting from the
disease are not specific to iron overload.8 Second, because of
limited sample size, NHDS is best used to quantify diagnoses
more common than hemochromatosis. For example, the sam-
ple sizes for each year were outside the range of reliability for
use in calculating confidence intervals, so we could not test for
significance the upward trend in the rate of hereditary hemo-
chromatosis-associated hospitalizations.
A previous study also used data from the NHDS to examine
trends in hemochromatosis-associated morbidity rates among
U.S. residents.9 This study used published reports of NCHS
data and was, therefore, limited to years where diagnoses coded
275.0 were tabulated (1979 and 1983­1987). That study re-
ported 3,000­6,000 hemochromatosis-associated hospitaliza-
tions per year. However, these estimates were not accurate be-
cause they did not exclude diagnoses associated with secondary
forms of hemochromatosis.5 Unlike the earlier report, we used
the original data from NCHS to calculate hereditary hemo-
chromatosis-associated hospitalization rates. We excluded
conditions associated with secondary iron overload diseases,
and found 2,000­5,000 annual hereditary hemochromatosis-
associated hospitalizations for these same years.
We also extended the study period by analyzing the NHDS
data for all years from 1979 through 1997. During this time, the
rate of hereditary hemochromatosis-associated hospitaliza-
tions among people over 60 years of age increased 60%. This
increase parallels the 60% increase in the listing of hemochro-
matosis on death certificates from 1979 to 1992.10 Both find-
ings may result from rising awareness in the United States of
iron-overload diseases, particularly hereditary hemochroma-
tosis. Because of the increased attention given hereditary
hemochromatosis since 1996, when the HFE gene was discov-
ered, a further increase in hereditary hemochromatosis-asso-
ciated hospitalization rates may be observed as the NHDS data
from 1998 and subsequent years become available.
