Abstract: Previous research has characterized human mate poaching as a prevalent
alternative mating strategy that entails risks and costs typically not present during general
romantic courtship and attraction. This study is the first to experimentally investigate
friendship between a poacher and his/her target as a risk mitigation tactic. Participants (N =
382) read a vignette that differed by whether the poacher was male/female and whether the
poacher and poached were friends/acquaintances. Participants assessed the likelihood of the
poacher being successful and incurring costs. They also rated the poacher and poached on
several personality and mate characteristics. Results revealed that friendship increased the
perceived likelihood of success of a mate poaching attempt and decreased the perceived
likelihood of several risks typically associated with mate poaching. However, friend-
poachers were rated less favorably than acquaintance-poachers across measures of warmth,
nurturance, and friendliness. These findings are interpreted using an evolutionary
perspective. This study complements and builds upon previous findings and is the first
experimental investigation of tactics poachers may use to mitigate risks inherent in mate
poaching.

Introduction
The purpose of the current research is to examine friendship as a tactic for
infiltrating a relationship. To this end, the focus of this research includes investigating 1)
whether friendship between a mate poacher and the person s/he is attempting to attract (the
poached) influences others' perceptions of the likely success of the mate poacher, 2) the
role that friendship may play in mitigating risks and costs associated with the mate
poaching strategy, and 3) whether friendship modulates perceived personality and
evolutionarily relevant mate characteristics of the poacher and poached.

Friendship and mate attraction
Friendship between a male and female can sometimes act as a precursor to the
formation of a romantic relationship. Previous friendship is often a very important stage in
the development of a long-term romantic relationship (Guerrero and Mongeau, 2008;
Hendrick and Hendrick, 2000). Bleske-Rechek and Buss (2001) found that single men and
women report a more frequent desire to form a committed romantic relationship with their
friends than do those already in a relationship. Furthermore, both sexes report a desire for
companionship and emotional support from friends; however, men are more likely to report
potential sexual access as an important reason to start a friendship than are women,
whereas women report social and physical protection from others as more important than
do men. These preferences are consistent with Sexual Strategies Theory, suggesting that
opposite-sex friendship formation may, in some cases, be motivated by factors that can
subsequently lead to romantic interest and facilitate the formation of a romantic
relationship. Not only does friendship help foster the initiation of a romantic relationship,
but it seems to play a major role in relationship maintenance. The degree of friendship
between individuals in a romantic relationship is positively related to both relationship
satisfaction and length (Graham, 2011). Furthermore, valuing friendship in a relationship is
a strong positive predictor of feelings of love, sexual gratification, and romantic
commitment over time (Vanderdrift, Wilson, and Agnew, 2012).
Given friendship's importance in general romantic relationships, friendship between
a mate poacher and poached may be an effective poaching tactic. Previous literature
suggests that insertion of the self into the social context of an existing relationship may
allow for deployment of more direct mate poaching tactics later on (Schmitt and Buss,
2001; Rusbult and Buunk, 1993). This strategic friendship might not only increase the
likelihood that a poaching attempt is successful by appealing to between-sex and across-sex
mate preferences but may also simultaneously mitigate risks that are unique to mate
poaching.
Poaching goals and benefits
Schmitt and Buss (2001) define mate poaching as behavior intended to attract
someone who is known to already be in a relationship. Studies examining the prevalence of
mate poaching reveal that mate poaching occurs at a considerable frequency cross-
culturally (Davies, Shackelford, and Hass, 2007; Schmitt, 2004; Schmitt and Buss, 2001),
with 30-50% of men and women reporting having engaged, at least once, in mate poaching
with the goal of starting a short-term relationship (e.g., one-night stands, brief affairs), or a
long-term relationship (e.g., potential marital relationships).
The prevalence of mate poaching suggests that it may confer advantages to those
who use it and to those targeted by it. Those who engage in mate poaching may benefit
from attempting to attract an individual who has proven to be a viable mating partner.
Humans partly use others' experiences and mate choices to determine their own mate
choice decisions (Grammar, Fink, Møller, and Thornhill, 2003; Miller and Todd, 1998;
Todd, Place, and Bowers, 2012), a process referred to as non-independent mate choice
(Pruett-Jones, 1992). For example, after observing real speed-date video recordings, both
men and women show greater short-term and long-term relationship interest towards
Friendship as a relationship infiltration tactic
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(4). 2013. -928-
individuals in dates they perceive as successful (Place, Todd, Penke, and Asendorpf, 2010).
This effect also occurs when assessing individuals who are currently in a relationship.
When presented opposite-sex targets who are either currently in a relationship or single,
women report being more interested in pursuing attached versus unattached targets (Eva
and Wood, 2006; Parker and Burkley, 2009). This evidence suggests that others' mate-
choice decisions help an individual decide which characteristics are desirable in a potential
mate for both unattached and attached targets.
Similarly, someone already in a relationship may benefit from being the target of
mate poaching. Though the reasons to break-up with one's current mate are numerous and
can vary across context and individual factors (Le, Dove, Agnew, Korn, and Mutso, 2010),
quality of and access to alternative romantic partners can influence mate expulsion
decisions (Rusbult, Martz, and Agnew, 1998; Rusbult and Van Lange, 2003). Some
individuals may require a realistic mate replacement before leaving their current
relationship for a different long-term relationship (Rusbult and Buunk, 1993). Men and
women can also benefit from choosing to go along with a short-term poaching attempt. In
accordance with a pluralistic mating strategy (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000), having
access to a greater variety of sexual partners can afford a male the opportunity to have more
offspring whereas a female could cuckold her current partner and have children by another,
potentially higher quality and genetically robust male.
Poaching risks
The goals of a mate poacher include not only acquisition of a mate but subversion
of that mate's current partner. To protect against this subversion, humans need to identify
potential mate poachers and also prevent their partner from being poached (Buss, 2002;
Shackelford and Buss, 1997). Schmitt and Buss (2001) found that over 70% of their sample
reported that someone had tried to attract a romantic partner away from them in the past, in
contrast to 50% of participants who report having attempted to poach, showing that people
may have a tendency to over-perceive threats to their relationship. However, only 30%
reported that their partner was successfully attracted away from them, which suggests this
sensitivity to potential infidelity may not be without benefit. Types of mate retention
behavior and their frequencies were studied in an undergraduate (Buss, 1986) and in a
married couples sample (Buss and Shackelford, 1997). Men's mate retention behavior
positively covaried with their partner's youth and physical attractiveness and women's
mate retention behavior positively covaried with their partner's income and status striving.
Also, men reported using resource display, submission and debasement, and intrasexual
threats to retain their mates more often than women, whereas women reported using
appearance enhancement and verbal signals of possession more than men.
To be successful a mate poacher must be able to successfully avoid or subvert the
retention tactics of the current partner. Failure to do this can have costly consequences. For
men, resource depletion, concerns for a mate's future infidelity, increased risk for disease,
and physical retribution from the female's mate have all been identified and judged as
greater potential costs associated with mate poaching (Buss and Shackelford, 1997; Schmitt
and Buss, 2001). For women, future infidelity of the man, self-degradation, worries of
unwanted pregnancy, risk of disease, acquisition of a bad reputation, and physical harm by
Friendship as a relationship infiltration tactic
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(4). 2013. -929-
the partner of the poached are judged as greater potential costs (Davies, Shackelford, and
Hass, 2010; Schmitt and Buss, 2001). Some violent mate retention behaviors can involve
particularly serious costs to both the poacher and poached (Shackelford, Buss, and Peters,
2000).
It would appear, then, that although mate poaching may aid mate acquisition, mate
poaching entails more and greater risks than those involved in general romantic courtship.
Davies et al. (2010) found that neither sex perceives the potential costs of mate poaching as
outweighing the benefits. Hence, the primary objective of the current research is to test the
general hypothesis that mate poaching is less risky when the mate poacher is a friend with
the poached.
Present study
The current research utilized a true experimental design. Because actual mate
poaching behavior is difficult to manipulate, we acquired individuals' perceptions of
hypothetical mate poaching situations. To test how friendship between a poacher and
poached affects perceptions of mate poaching outcomes and perceptions of the poacher and
poached's personality traits, participants read one of four fictional accounts of a mate
poaching attempt. Vignettes and imagined or fictional scenarios have been used in studies
looking at impression formation (Sherman and Klein, 1994), infidelity and jealousy (Buss,
Larsen, Westen, and Semmelroth, 1992; Wade, Kelley, and Church, 2012), and have been
shown to induce physiological responses similar to experiencing the imagined scenario
(Buss et al., 1992; Malta et al., 2001). Each vignette varied by whether the poacher was a
man or woman and whether the poacher and poached were close friends or acquaintances.
Participants then rated the likelihood of several poaching outcomes, poacher and poached
mate attributes, and poacher motivations.
Hypothesis 1: Increased poaching success
It was hypothesized that the poacher would be rated as more likely to be successful
in the poaching attempt when the poacher and poached were close friends than when they
were not friends. Friendship may signal attributes important for continued investment in the
relationship and future offspring (Guerrero and Mongeau, 2008; Graham, 2011; Hendrick
and Hendrick, 2000; Vanderdrift et al., 2012); therefore, the poacher may be perceived as a
desired replacement for the poached's current mate (Rusbult and Buunk, 1993; Rusbult et
al., 1998; Rusbult and Van Lange, 2003).
Hypothesis 2: Mitigated costly outcomes
It was predicted that when participants observed a mate poaching scenario in which
the poacher and poached were close friends as opposed to acquaintances, they would
evaluate costly outcomes as less likely to occur. Participants rated the likelihood of the
following risky/costly outcomes: physical retaliation and suspicion from the poached
individual's partner, future poached infidelity, shortened relationship duration, peer and
familial disapproval of the relationship, and the poached individual's resentment toward the
poacher. These outcomes were risky/costly outcomes implicated in Schmitt and Buss
(2001), Davies et al. (2010), and Sexual Strategies Theory (Buss and Schmitt, 1993).
Friendship as a relationship infiltration tactic
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(4). 2013. -930-
Friendship may not mitigate every risk; however, we included several types of outcomes to
characterize how friendship moderates poaching success and observer perceptions. For
example, if friendship decreases the likelihood of physical retaliation and partner suspicion,
perhaps friendship functions to avoid third-party detection and punishment. Alternatively,
if friendship increases the likelihood of poacher/poached relationship longevity, decreases
the chance of the poached cheating on the poacher in the future, or is more likely to result
in approval of friends, family, and the poached, perhaps friendship functions to avoid long-
term risks and costs.
Hypothesis 3: Favorable mate attributes
It was also predicted that individuals would judge the poacher and poached more
favorably across several important mate attributes if they were close friends as opposed to
acquaintances. Schmitt and Buss (2001) found that those who engaged in mate poaching
tend to rate themselves lower in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Those who were
more likely to receive poaching attempts tended to be high in Extraversion and Openness to
Experience, and those who were low in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness and high in
Neuroticism tended to go along with poaching attempts made upon them. Furthermore,
measures from the "Sexy Seven" sexuality attributes inventory (Schmitt and Buss, 2000)
indicated that those who engage in mate poaching rated themselves as low in relationship
exclusivity, having an erotophilic disposition (the tendency to react positively to sexual
cues), being sexually attractive and lacking sexual exclusivity. Those who were more likely
to receive poaching attempts rated themselves as more sexually attractive and lower in
relationship exclusivity, whereas those who were more likely to go along with a mate
poaching attempt rated themselves low on relationship exclusivity, had a masculine gender
orientation, were low on emotional investment, and were high on erotophilic disposition.
This evidence suggests that people may already possess a priori perceptions about those
who engage in mate poaching. The positive relationship qualities signaled by friendship
between two mates may lead participants to perceive the poacher and poached as
possessing more desirable personality and mate attributes than when they are
acquaintances.
Hypothesis 4: Greater friendship effectiveness for male poachers
We hypothesized that participants' perceptions of outcomes and mate attributes may
be moderated by the sex of the poacher. Both sexes launch romantic relationships out of
friendships (Bleske-Rechek and Buss, 2001); however, men's and women's mate
preferences may differ on the basis of minimal levels of parental investment in offspring
(Buss and Schmitt, 1993). Sexual Strategies Theory predicts that females have evolved a
stronger preference than men for potential long-term mates who are able and willing to
devote resources to themselves and their offspring (Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Ellis, 1992).
Accordingly, if friendship signals traits associated with investment, participants may rate
friendship as more effective when the scenarios depicted a male poacher and a female
target.

Hypothesis 5: Poacher motivations
Lastly, we hypothesized that a greater proportion of observers will predict that a
friend-poacher is motivated to start a long-term relationship than is an acquaintance-
poacher. This would further suggest that friendship signals that the poacher is a viable
replacement for the poached's current mate and possesses desirable long-term mate
characteristics.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Participants consisted of 382 individuals (47.5% male, 52.5% female) recruited
from two populations: 282 Mechanical Turk (MTurk) users and 100 undergraduate students
from a private University in the Northeastern US. MTurk is a crowd-sourcing service
hosted by Amazon through which participants were paid $0.25 for completion of the
experiment. MTurk has been gaining popularity in recent psychological research and has
been shown to be a high quality source of data (Buhrmester, Kwang, and Gosling, 2011).
Any MTurk participant who completed the survey in less than five minutes was excluded
from analyses to control for individuals who rushed through the survey, resulting in the 282
participants who were used. Undergraduate students were recruited from the psychology
department research participant pool and received credit in their introductory psychology
classes. All procedures of this study were approved by the local Institutional Review
Board.
The mean age of the sample was 29.13 (SD = 9.23, range = 18-67). The racial
composition self-identified as 63.3% Asian, 29.2% White, 3.9% Black, and 3.6% other. A
majority of the sample was heterosexual (81.1%) with some identifying as homosexual
(9.7%) and other (9.25%). About three-fourths of the sample reported having ever been in a
sexual relationship (74.1%). More than half of the sample reported currently being in a
relationship (56.8%), whereas 39% reported being currently single and 3.3% were unsure.
A majority of the sample (83.95%) reported that they were not currently on birth control
medication of any type.
Materials and procedures
After signing the informed consent, participants were presented with the following
instructions:
For the following experiment, you will be asked to read a short paragraph detailing
the relationship between three individuals. Please take your time to fully read the
paragraph and form some initial impressions about the individuals described. To do
this, you will be asked to imagine that you know these individuals and that you are
a friend, acquaintance, or bystander who happens to observe what is
happening between them. After hearing their story, you will be asked to make
several ratings pertaining to the likelihood of certain events happening between
these individuals. You will also be asked to rate the individuals on several measures
of their personality and sexuality. While we realize that you cannot learn everything
about a person or group of people from one, short story, we ask that you
Friendship as a relationship infiltration tactic
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(4). 2013. -932-
please make these ratings based on your initial impression of the individuals
described.
Participants were then presented with one of four short vignettes depicting a
heterosexual mate poaching situation involving three individuals. These individuals were
the poacher (the person doing the poaching), the poached (the target of the poaching
attempt), and the poachee (the person currently in a relationship with the poached). These
four vignettes varied across two variables: sex of the poacher/poached and whether the
poacher and poached were friends. The following two vignette examples demonstrate how
the friendship variable was manipulated (See bolded text):
Friendship Condition
Imagine the following:
You happened to hear an interesting story the other day about three people, John,
Sarah, and Chris. Through your own experiences and a few rumors, you piece
together the following information about them.
John and Sarah have been in an exclusive relationship for about a year. Recently,
John and Sarah have been having problems in their relationship and their
relationship has been uneasy. Sarah often talks about the problems in her
relationship with Chris, a close friend she goes to for advice and comfort, and
with whom she enjoys spending time. Chris is attracted to Sarah. He realizes that
she is in an exclusive relationship, yet he still flirts with her in hopes that something
may happen between Sarah and him.
Friendship Absent Condition
Imagine the following:
You happened to hear an interesting story the other day about three people, John,
Sarah, and Chris. Through your own experiences and a few rumors, you piece
together the following information about them.
John and Sarah have been in an exclusive relationship for about a year. Recently,
John and Sarah have been having problems in their relationship and their
relationship has been uneasy. Chris is an acquaintance of Sarah's and they know
very little about each other. Chris is attracted to Sarah. He realizes that she is in
an exclusive relationship, yet he still flirts with her in hopes that something may
happen between Sarah and him.
To manipulate the sex of the poacher, the vignettes remained the same except that
Chris' name was replaced with "Rachel," and Sarah and John switched roles as poached
and poached.
After, participants were asked to make several ratings about the poacher's likelihood
Friendship as a relationship infiltration tactic
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(4). 2013. -933-
of 1) being successful and 2) incurring future costs/risks. On a 1 to 7 scale from "Highly
unlikely" to "Highly likely," participants were asked:
1) How likely is it that Chris will succeed in attracting Sarah away from John?
2) How likely is it that John will suspect that Chris is trying to attract Sarah away
from him?
3) How likely is it that John will inflict physical harm on Chris for trying to attract
Sarah?
4) If Chris and Sarah formed a new long-term relationship, how likely is it that the
relationship would last for more than a year?
5) If Chris and Sarah start a new long-term relationship, how likely is it that
Sarah would cheat on him in the future?
6) How likely is it that their friends will not approve of how Chris and Sarah started
their relationship?
7) How likely is it that either of their families will not approve of how Chris and
Sarah started their relationship?
8) How likely is it that Sarah will later resent Chris for the way they started their
relationship?
In order to collect novel descriptive information not examined in previous literature,
participants were also asked to indicate the following:
1) In your opinion, is it OK that Chris is trying to attract Sarah away from John?
(Yes No)
2) What is most likely the type of relationship that Chris intends to start with Sarah
by attracting her away from John?
(A one-night stand. A short-term affair. A new long-term relationship.)
Participants were then asked to indicate their impressions of the poacher and poached
across several evolutionarily relevant mate characteristics. Using measures from Wade,
Auer, and Roth (2009), participants rated them on a 1 (Not Very) to 7 (Very) scale for 1)
intelligence, 2) physical attractiveness, 3) sexual attractiveness, 4) warmth, 5) dominance,
6) friendliness, 7) masculinity, 8) nurturance, 9) social competence (possessing good social
skills) and whether they would be a good: 10) parent or 11) mate. They finished by filling
out a demographic questionnaire indicating age, sex, race, current relationship status,
sexual relationship experience, and birth control usage.
Results
Mate poaching outcomes
Following Cooley and Lohnes (1971), Dunteman (1984), Morrison (1967), Overall
and Klett (1972), and Tabachnick and Fidell (1996), we ran two MANOVAs rather than
separate ANOVAs for the dependent variables in order to control for inflated Type I error
that would occur with conducting numerous separate ANOVAs. Univariate comparisons
within each MANOVA were also Bonferroni adjusted. Correlations between dependent
variables were below 0.3, suggesting there was no issue of multicollinearity between
Friendship as a relationship infiltration tactic

measures. Descriptive statistics and effect sizes for tests relevant to hypotheses 1, 2, and 3
are reported in Table 1.
To test hypothesis 1 and 2, a 2(Friendship) X 2(Sex of Poacher) between subjects
MANOVA was performed to examine whether participants' mean ratings of the likelihood
of the eight risky/costly outcomes differed between conditions. This analysis revealed a
main effect for friendship, F(8, 371) = 3.79, p < .001, 2 = .076 (see Table 1). Poachers
who were close friends with the poached were rated as more likely to successfully mate
poach than when the poacher was an acquaintance. Similarly, the resulting relationship
between the poacher and poached was rated as more likely to last beyond a year when they
were friends than if they were acquaintances. The poached was also rated as less likely to
cheat on the poacher in the future if they were friends as opposed to acquaintances.
There was also a main effect for poacher sex for which no hypotheses were
generated, F(8, 371) = 6.04, p < .001, 2 = .115. Female poachers (M = 4.96, SD = 1.51)
were rated as more likely to be suspect of poaching than were male poachers (M = 4.36, SD
= 1.72), F(1, 378) = 12.98, p <.001, d = 0.37. However, male poachers (M = 4.75, SD =
1.70) were rated as more likely to suffer physical retaliation from the poached's partner
than were female poachers (M = 3.75, SD = 1.63), F(1, 378) = 10.65 p = .001, d = 0.34.
Participants also reported that family members were more likely to approve of the resulting
relationship if the poacher was female (M = 4.50, SD = 1.53) rather than male (M = 4.15,
SD = 1.65), F(1, 378) = 4.51, p = .034, d = 0.22. The same was true of friends, with the
relationship more likely to be approved if the poacher was female (M = 4.75, SD = 1.62)
rather than male (M = 4.41, SD = 1.77), F(1, 378) = 4.10, p = .043, d = 0.20.
Mate attributes
To test hypothesis 3, participants rated the poacher and poached on several
important mate attributes based on the initial impressions they formed from the vignette. A
second 2(Friendship) X 2(Sex of Poacher) between subjects MANOVA was performed to
examine whether participants' mean ratings of these characteristics differed by condition.
There was a main effect for friendship, F(22, 357) = 2.83, p < .001, 2 = .149 (see Table 1).
The poacher was rated as more intelligent, warm, friendly, and nurturant when the poacher
and poached were portrayed as acquaintances as opposed to friends. There were no
significant differences for ratings of the poached.
There was also a main effect for sex of the poacher for which no hypotheses were
generated, F(22, 357) = 11.76, p < .001, 2 = .421. When the poacher was a male poaching
a woman (M = 3.19, SD = 1.42), he was rated as more sexually attractive than when the
poacher was a female poaching a male (M = 2.83, SD = 1.41), F(1, 378) = 12.37, p = .013,
d = 0.25. The poached was also rated as more intelligent when the poacher was male (M =
2.94, SD = 1.33) rather than female (M = 3.49, SD = 1.26), F(1, 378) = 4.76, p = .030, d =
0.42. Interestingly, male poachers (M = 2.94, SD = 1.33) were rated as less masculine than
female poachers (M = 4.72, SD = 1.81), F(1, 378) = 118.2, p < .001, d = 1.12. Individuals
being poached were rated as more masculine when the poacher was male (M = 4.84, SD =
1.95) than when the poacher was female (M = 2.79, SD = 1.49), F(1, 378) = 133.89, p <
.001, d = 1.18.

Poacher sex/friendship interactions
To test hypothesis 4, we examined the interaction between the poacher's sex and
friendship manipulation for both MANOVAs. There was neither a significant interaction of
poacher sex and the friendship manipulation for mate poaching outcomes, F(8, 371) = 0.61,
p = .766, nor for mate attributes, F(22, 357) = 1.184, p = .259.
Poacher motivations
To test hypothesis 5, participants were asked to indicate what type of relationship
they thought the poacher wanted to initiate with the poached: a one-night stand, a short-
term affair, or a new long-term relationship. A Chi-square Test for Independence indicated
that participants' predictions significantly differed across the friendship status of the
poacher and poached, 2(2, N = 382) = 16.82, p < .001,  = .210. Three Chi-square
Goodness of Fit analyses were used to address pair-wise comparisons. There was no
significant difference between the number of participants that predicted a one-night stand
when the poacher was a friend versus acquaintance, 2(1, N = 38) = .947, p = .330.
However, significantly more individuals predicted that acquaintance poachers were more
interested in a short-term affair than were friend poachers, 2(1, N = 162) = 8.91, p = .003,
whereas friend poachers were more interested in a new long-term relationship than were
acquaintance poachers, 2(1, N = 182) = 7.12, p = .008. Observed frequencies are reported
in Table 2.

conditions

Total 9.9% 42.4% 47.6%
Sample comparisons
To address potential differences between the MTurk and undergraduate samples,
the two MANOVAs and Chi Square Test for Independence were run separately for each
group. Significant findings were similar in these two samples. In the MTurk sample, there
was a main effect of the friendship manipulation for costly/risky outcomes, F(8, 271) =
2.45, p = .012, and no interaction of poacher sex and friendship, F(8, 271) = 0.90, p = .518.
There was also a main effect for mate attributes, F(22, 257) = 1.87, p = 0.12, and no
interaction, F(22, 257) = 0.96, p = .522. In the undergraduate sample, there was a main
effect of friendship manipulation for costly/risky outcomes, F(8, 89) = 2.92, p = .006, and
no interaction of poacher sex and friendship, F(8, 89) = 1.13, p = .350, as well as a main
effect for mate attributes, F(22, 74) = 3.33, p < .001, and no interaction, F(22, 74) = 1.02,
p = .448. Post-hoc analysis revealed similar group differences for each outcome and mate
attribute.

The Chi Square Tests of Independence indicated participants' predictions of the
poacher's motivation significantly differed in the same direction across friendship status in
both the MTurk sample, 2(2, N = 282) = 8.12, p = .017, and the undergraduate sample,
2(2, N = 100) = 12.86, p = .002.
Discussion
The role of friendship as a relationship infiltration tactic for mate poaching was
investigated by asking participants to read one of four vignettes depicting a heterosexual
mate poaching scenario in which the mate poacher and the poached were friends or
acquaintances, as well as whether the poacher was male or female. Participants then rated
the likelihood of several outcomes as well as their impressions of the poacher and poached
across several evolutionarily relevant mate characteristics.
Hypothesis 1 was supported. Friendship between the poacher and poached
increased the perceived likelihood that the mate poacher would be successful. Hypothesis 2
was also partially supported. When the poacher and poached were friends, their new long-
term relationship was rated as more likely to last longer than a year. Furthermore, within
this long-term relationship, the poached was rated as less likely to cheat on the poacher in
the future. Together, hypothesis 1 and 2 characterize how friendship may assist a mate
poacher. One interpretation is that friendship may be a useful tactic for signaling future
investment in a long-term relationship to a potential mate. This is consistent with literature
showing that friendship is an important factor in long-term relationship formation and
maintenance (Graham, 2011; Guerrero and Mongeau, 2008; Hendrick and Hendrick, 2000;
Vanderdrift et al., 2012). Also, both men and women recognize opposite-sex friendships as
one strategy for initiating romantic relationships (Bleske-Rechek and Buss, 2001).
Our data also indicated the likelihood of being suspected by the poached's current
mate and suffering physical retaliation from that mate was the same for the friend and the
acquaintance poachers. Furthermore, friends and family were perceived as just as likely to
approve of the new relationship whether the poacher and poached were friends or not, and
the poached was just as likely to resent the poacher afterwards. Schmitt and Buss (2001)
found that participants rated future infidelity concerns and an uncertain future as more
costly for long-term than short-term mate poaching. This pattern seems to indicate that
friendship is perceived to be most effective for reducing long-term relational instability
between the poacher and poached and less effective for mitigating risks associated with
third-parties such as the poached's current mate and family/friends. It would appear that
participants recognize that friendship between partners can play an important role in
relationship maintenance and that friendship may signal traits desired in a long-term mate.
Interestingly, hypothesis 3 was not supported. In fact, the opposite effect was found.
Acquaintance-poachers were rated as more warm, friendly, and nurturant than were friend-
poachers. A possible explanation for this pattern is that as observers, participants may have
greater doubts about whether the poacher's friendship is an intentional strategy rather than
genuine friendship. From the perspective of the poacher and poached, their friendship may
appear to serve no functional purpose related to mate poaching. In this way, the benefits of
friendship in signaling investment, compatibility, and traits desired in a long-term mate are
Friendship as a relationship infiltration tactic
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(4). 2013. -938-
maintained as genuine, honest signals for those directly involved. However, observers may
be more knowledgeable of the mate poacher's intentions. Schmitt and Buss (2001) found
that agreeable and conscientious people are less likely to be poachers. Perhaps raters
associate poachers with those traits and thus view friend-poachers more negatively because
friends should be kind and reliable, not attempting to dissolve a friend's relationship for
their own benefit. Bleske and Shackelford (2001) found that people experience more upset
in response to imagined mate rivalry from a friend than from a stranger.
Alternatively, observers may judge others' mate poaching behaviors with a double
standard. It would be adaptive for individuals to disprove of another's tactical use of
friendship to mate poach while also understanding its effectiveness and endorsing the
strategy for one's own use. Humans possess a wide variety of tactics for engaging in self-
promotion as well as competitor derogation (Schmitt and Buss, 1996; Tooke and Camire,
1991). Bleske and Shackelford (2001) found that people report being deceived by friends
about mating rivalry more often than they themselves report engaging in deceit. Therefore,
perhaps the disparity between observers' view of friendship as effective and their negative
evaluation of friend-poachers is a manifestation of strategic deception.
Hypothesis 4 was not supported. There were no sex differences in how effective
friendship was for a mate poacher. One possible explanation is that friendship serves to
signal romantic compatibility across important mate characteristics that are not necessarily
sex-specific. In a potential long-term mate, both sexes tend to value traits such as being
kind, understanding, exciting, intelligent, and creative (Buss and Barnes, 1986; Buss and
Schmitt, 1993). These complex personality traits may arguably be more difficult and take
more time to assess than other signals of mate quality such as physical attractiveness, social
standing, or wealth. Friendship may afford men and women information about a potential
mate that can be used to more accurately assess how compatible they may be as romantic
partners. In their review, Montoya, Horton, and Kirchner (2008) found that both actual and
perceived similarity between individuals strongly predicted interpersonal attraction in both
existing and potential romantic relationships. Therefore, participants may have believed
that poachers and those poached who were close friends had already acquired information
about one another and were more likely to be compatible and attracted to one another than
not.
Hypothesis 5 was supported. It was predicted that participants would think that
friend-poachers were more interested in starting a long-term relationship than either a one-
night stand or a short-term affair. It was also predicted that they would think acquaintance-
poachers would be more interested in a one-night stand or short-term affair than a long-
term relationship. Both of these predictions were supported. This evidence is further
support that friendship signals long-term poaching goals.
Conclusions and future directions
Several characteristics of this study demand that the results be interpreted with care.
Previous research from which hypotheses were generated used largely college-aged
samples (Schmitt and Buss, 2001; Schmitt 2004). The current study sampled participants
from both an exclusively college-aged population as well as from a more diverse MTurk
population (Buhrmester et al., 2011). Nevertheless, we found that both samples separately
Friendship as a relationship infiltration tactic
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(4). 2013. -939-
followed the same pattern of findings. Also, a majority of the population reported not
currently using hormone-based birth control, which has been shown to affect long-term and
short-term mate preference, perceptions of masculinity, and attraction (Cornwell et al.,
2004; Jones et al., 2005, 2008; Little, Jones, Penton-Voak, Burt, and Perrett, 2002; Penton-
Voak, Little, Jones, Burt, and Perrett, 2003; Smith, Jones, Little, DeBruine, and Welling,
2009). Most importantly, these results measure perceptions of those observing fictional
scenarios and may not generalize beyond the perceptions of an unrelated or uninvolved
observer. Perceptions of observers are important for measuring costly behavior largely
because mate poaching entails risks closely associated with social stigma and the reactions
of others. However, it is also important in that observers may see themselves in the mate
poaching scenarios, referencing their own romantic relationships (Andersen and Cole,
1990), experiences with mate poaching (Schmitt and Buss, 2001), and personal beliefs
(Dunning and Hayes, 1996; Marks and Miller, 1987; Ross, Green, and House, 1977), which
may have been shaped in part by evolved mechanisms for engaging in and combating mate
poaching behavior (Buss, 1986; Buss, 2002; Schmitt and Shackelford, 2003; Shackelford
and Buss, 1997). Nevertheless, it would be important for future studies to use other, more
direct measures to verify whether friendship is effective beyond altering observer
perceptions of success and risk. It would also be informative to gather descriptive
information from participants about whether and how often they have personally used
friendship as a poaching tactic and its effectiveness.
There are several design changes that could be useful for future investigations.
Rather than participants rating "how likely" each cost would be to occur, it may be helpful
to have participants indicate "how costly" each outcome would be. An investigation of
likelihood is conceptually similar to a forced-choice paradigm where participants are lead
to believe something can either occur or not occur (e.g., how likely is physical retaliation to
occur (or not occur)?). If participants were to indicate "how costly" an outcome would be,
they would instead indicate the severity of the cost on a continuous scale (e.g., how
severe/costly would the physical retaliation be?).
Also, no previous study has looked at what observers predicted were the poacher's
motivations. Participants viewed friend-poachers as more likely to be motivated by long-
term goals and acquaintance-poachers motivated by short-term goals. It would be important
for future studies to test whether having these predictions or being primed to have these
predictions alters observers' perceptions of mate poaching. Furthermore, if observers have
a personal connection to the mate poacher, poached, or poachee (such as through a friend,
family member, or other associate), it may influence the observers' evaluations. Similarly,
we presented the relationships within our scenario as unstable, a condition that may
increase the perceived effectiveness of friendship as a tactic (Schmitt and Buss, 2001).
Future studies should examine how experimental manipulation of the relationship context
affects perceptions of tactical effectiveness not only for friendship but other strategies.
Aside from participants' ratings of the poached individual's mate characteristics,
this study focused almost exclusively on the benefits of friendship for the poacher.
However, the poached individual has as much to benefit and lose from being poached
(Schmitt and Shackelford, 2003). Friendship with the poacher may also function to mitigate
risks face by the poached individual. Though some of the risks investigated in this study are
Friendship as a relationship infiltration tactic
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(4). 2013. -940-
the same for poachers and those poached (Schmitt and Buss, 2001), some questions were
not framed to evaluate poached risks. For example, participants were asked "the likelihood
that the poached individual would cheat on the poacher," but were not asked the likelihood
of whether the poacher would cheat on the poached individual. Furthermore, the current
study did not look at risks that may be unique to those poached, such as loss of resources,
dissolution of the current relationship, and retaliation from the poachee against the poached
individual or restrictive/violent mate guarding behavior. It would also be interesting to see
what participants thought was the motivation of the poached individual during a mate
poaching encounter and whether the poached individual was more interested in a long-term
or short-term relationship.
This study contributes experimental evidence to a body of work that has largely
been descriptive or quasi-experimental. It also introduces a methodology by which mate
poaching may be experimentally studied indirectly through the perceptions of others.
Overall, these data support the claim that, by increasing the likelihood of success and
decreasing several costs unique to poaching, friendship is seen as an effective tactic for
infiltrating an existing relationship. These findings support hypotheses formulated from
previous data on mate poaching and provide several novel findings from which new,
testable predictions can be generated.
