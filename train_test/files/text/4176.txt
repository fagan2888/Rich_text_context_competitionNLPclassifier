Abstract
Objectives: To evaluate levels of CD44 standard variant (CD44s), CD44 variant exon 3
(CD44v3) and CD44 variant exon 6 (CD44v6) protein in breast cancer tissue, and investigate their
relationships with clinicopathological characteristics of the disease.
Methods: Immunohistochemistry for CD44s, CD44v3 and CD44v6 was retrospectively
performed on formalin-fixed paraffin wax-embedded breast cancer tissue samples.
Results: Tumour tissue samples from 60 patients with breast cancer were included. There was a
significant relationship between CD44s positivity and tumour diameter and lymph node
involvement. CD44v6 positivity was significantly associated with tumour­node­metastasis
(TNM) stage and lymph node involvement. There were significant negative correlations between
CD44s immunopositivity, tumour diameter and TNM stage, and significant positive correlations
between CD44v6 immunopositivity, tumour diameter and TNM stage.
Conclusions: CD44s and CD44v6 appear to play opposing roles in the development of breast
cancer, but their precise functions and mechanisms of action remain unclear.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most prevalent malig-
nancy and the second most common cause of
cancer-related mortality in women world-
wide.1 Improvement in the clinical manage-
ment of breast cancer is dependent on having
a greater understanding of known prognos-
tic factors and the identification of indicators
that may help to assess tumour behaviour.
The multifunctional and multistructural
transmembrane glycoprotein CD44 was ori-
ginally characterized as a hyaluronan (HA)
receptor and lymphocyte homing receptor.2
CD44 plays a pivotal role in the prognosis of
malignancies including breast cancer.3­5
CD44 exists as both the standard form
(CD44s) and a number of isoforms gener-
ated by alternative splicing of variant exons
(CD44v).6
The standard form, CD44s, is related to
the proliferation, infiltration, angiogenesis,
metastasis and prognosis of breast cancer.6,7
CD44s expression is significantly higher in
gastric cancer than in normal gastric tissue,
and this increased expression is associated
with adenocarcinoma tumourigenesis,
metastasis and clinically aggressive behav-
iour.8 In contrast, loss of CD44s has been
found to correlate with lymph node
metastasis and unfavourable outcome in
patients with breast carcinoma.9 The role
of CD44s in cancer remains to be fully
elucidated.
The CD44 exon 3 variant (CD44v3) plays
a role in breast cancer development.10
CD44v3 promotes tumourigenesis in noma
of the head and neck, and might be an
effective tumour marker for targeted ther-
apy.10,11 In addition, CD44v3 is associated
with relapse and reduced overall survival in
people with vulvar cancer.12 CD44 exon 6
variant (CD44v6) is responsible for the
regulation of tumour invasion, progression
and metastasis in rat carcinoma cells.13
CD44v6 is also correlated with prognosis
in breast,14 gastric,15 colorectal,16 ovarian,17
bladder 18 and liver cancer.19
The mechanisms by which CD44 iso-
forms exert their effects in cancer are
unclear. The present study used immunohis-
tochemistry to evaluate CD44s, CD44v3
and CD44v6 levels in breast cancer tissue,
and investigate their relationships with clin-
icopathological characteristics.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study included samples of tumour tissue
from female patients with breast cancer who
underwent surgical resection at Department
of Radiation Oncology, The First People's
Hospital of Xuzhou, Xuzhou, China,
between January 2011 and June 2012.
Patient diagnoses were confirmed by two
independent pathologists (G. L. and Y. X.),
and tumours were classified according to the
tumour­node­metastasis (TNM) system of
the International Union against Cancer
(1988).20 No patient received any radiother-
apy or chemotherapy prior to enrolment.
The Medical Ethics Committees of Soochow
University and Nanjing Medical University
approved the study and all patients provided
written informed consent prior to
enrolment.
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-Exed, paraffin wax-embedded
tumour tissue and adjacent normal mucosa
samples were sliced into 4 mm-thick sections.
Immunohistochemistry for CD44s, CD44v3
and CD44v6 was performed using ultrasen-
sitive immunohistochemical kits (Maxim
Co., Ltd, Fuzhou, China), according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
Immunoreactivity for CD44 proteins was
observed as brown, granular staining on the
cytoplasmic membrane of both cancerous
and stromal cells. Protein staining was
evaluated in arbitrarily selected visual
fields. Staining was classified as: negative
(À), 0­<10% positive cells; weak positive
174 Journal of International Medical Research 43(2)
(þ), 10­25% positive cells; positive (þþ),
26­50% positive cells; or strong positive
(þþþ), !51% positive cells. For the pur-
poses of this study, all positive staining
levels (þ, þþ and þþþ) were defined as
positive.
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as n. Analysis of vari-
ance, Wilcoxon's rank sum test and
Spearman's rank correlation analysis were
used to analyse the relationships between
clinicopathological features and CD44s,
CD44v3 and CD44v6 immunopositivity.
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSSÕ version 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) for WindowsÕ. P-values < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
The study included tissue samples from 60
female patients with breast cancer (42
infiltrating ductal carcinomas, seven intra-
ductal carcinomas, six mucinous adenocar-
cinomas, one medullary carcinoma, three
papillary adenocarcinomas and one lobular
infiltrating carcinoma). Patients were aged
32­81 years (median age, 51 years).
Positive staining rates of CD44s, CD44v3
and CD44v6 in breast cancer tissue samples
were 78.3%, 75.0% and 78.3%, respectively.
The cellular location of CD44 proteins
varied, with CD44s found both on the
cytoplasmic membrane and in the cyto-
plasm, and CD44v3 and CD44v6 mainly
found in the cytoplasm and only occasion-
ally on the cytoplasmic membrane
(Figure 1).
Relationships between CD44s, CD44v6
and CD44v3 immunopositivity in breast
cancer tissue samples and clinicopathologi-
cal characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Using analysis of variance, there was a
significant relationship between CD44s posi-
tivity and tumour diameter (P ¼ 0.020) and
lymph node involvement (P ¼ 0.001).
CD44v6 was significantly associated with
tumour stage (P ¼ 0.010). There were no
other statistically significant relationships
between CD44s, CD44v6 or CD44v3 and
any other clinicopathological characteristic
(Table 1). Analyses using Wilcoxon's rank
sum test indicated significant relationships
between lymph node involvement status and
immunopositivity for CD44s (P ¼ 0.001)
and CD44v6 (P ¼ 0.009), but not CD44v3.
There were significant negative correl-
ations between CD44s immunopositivity in
breast cancer tissue and tumour diameter
(r ¼ ­0.338, P < 0.01) and stage (r ¼ À0.298;
P < 0.05), and significant positive correl-
ations between CD44v6 immunopositivity
and tumour diameter (r ¼ 0.257; P < 0.05)
and stage (r ¼ 0.383; P < 0.01). There were
no significant correlations between CD44v3
and tumour diameter or stage.
Discussion
The molecular and cellular processes under-
lying breast cancer development are poorly
understood, and there are few definitive
biological markers. The present study was
designed to determine the value of CD44
molecules as tumour markers for breast
cancer. We found that CD44s was located
to the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas
CD44v3 and v6 were found in the cyto-
plasm. This suggests that CD44s may be the
more useful of these molecules as a thera-
peutic target.
The present study observed that CD44s
and CD44v6 had identical rates of immu-
nopositivity, but their cellular location and
biological function were different. This iden-
tical rate of positive staining is likely to be a
coincidence, but larger numbers of samples
are required to confirm this.
Both CD44s and CD44v6 positivity were
associated with tumour stage and diameter
in the present study, indicating that these
molecules may be useful tumour markers.
Wu et al. 175
In addition, CD44s and CD44v6 were both
correlated with lymph node involvement. In
contrast to our findings, others have found
significant associations between CD44v3
and tumour development or prognosis.10­12
This inconsistency may be due to hetero-
geneity within the tumour itself, differ-
ent standards for evaluating staining,
or variations in antibody specificity or
sensitivity.
Interestingly, tumour diameter and stage
were negatively correlated with CD44s but
positively correlated with CD44v6 in the
present study, suggesting that these mol-
ecules have opposing roles in breast cancer
development. Patients with CD44v6-posi-
tive/CD44s-negative tumours may have an
increased risk of tumour invasion and
metastasis. Others have found that normal
ductal epithelial cells of mammary glands

and proliferative mammary cells do not
express CD44 variants.21 In addition,
CD44v6-positive breast cancers were more
likely to have lymph node involvement
than CD44v6-negative tumours.21 It is
possible that transcriptional alterations
in CD44 result in functional and structural
abnormalities, impacting on recogni-
tion, adhesion and information transfer
among cells, ultimately altering biological
behaviour. Moreover, these adhesion
factors could be important molecular bio-
logical markers that predict the invasion and
metastatic prognosis of breast cancer.
Members of the CD44 family were found
to be biological markers in colorectal
cancer.22
It is well known that CD44 is the major
HA receptor, and that HA-bound CD44
participates in tumour progression, metas-
tasis and proliferation.6 CD44 has been
demonstrated to play a role in promoting
cell-to-extracellular matrix interaction,23
binding to HA,24,25 binding to matrix
metalloproteinase,24 and erbB receptor tyro-
sine kinases.24
The present study has several limitations,
notably the small sample size. In particular,
only five patients had stage IV tumours.
Future studies should include at least 100
participants in order to meet statistical
requirements as well as nontumour control
tissues. A further limitation was that reverse
transcription­polymerase chain reaction

assessment of gene expression and enable
the investigation of its correlation with
protein levels. Finally, we included a limited
number of clinicopathological variables.
Data regarding histological grade, prolifer-
ation index, and oestrogen receptor/HER2
status should be included in future studies.
In conclusion, CD44s and CD44v6
appear to play opposing roles in the devel-
opment of breast cancer, but their precise
function and mechanisms of action remain
unclear.
