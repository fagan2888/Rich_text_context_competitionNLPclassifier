Introduction
The treatise on temporal authority (TA) is what is popularly
known as the Two Kingdoms Theory/Doctrine. The
Evangelical Lutheran Church in Zimbabwe's (ELCZ) expla-
nation for this theory is that there is a separation between the
church and the state and therefore the church should not pro-
fane itself with issues of politics (Moyo, 2013). The separa-
tion means that Lutherans should be silent about politics in
church and the state should also be relatively silent about the
church. However, it is common knowledge that politicians
want the church to legitimate their leadership, hence their
visits to churches toward any major general election.
Zimbabwean politicians also preach to the church to leave
politics to politicians and concentrate on preaching the "gos-
pel" about heaven (Moyo, 2013, p. 208). Politicians use
Romans 13:1-71 to silence any criticism from the church
while demanding unquestioning allegiance. Based on the
level of political violence (see Blair, 2003), Zimbabweans in
different walks of life have come to believe that politics is a
dirty game, so good people, such as Christians, should not be
involved in politics. This article asks the following ques-
tions: Does the treatise on TA advocate for church a quietist
ideology on politics and good governance? If this treatise is
about church silence on politics, then why did Luther use this
same treatise to give pastoral political advice on good gover-
nance to Christian princes? This article argues that Luther
could not have advocated for silence using the same treatise
where he gives pastoral advice on good political
governance.
Background to the Article--The Luther
Decade
The Lutheran reformation "started" on the 31st of October
1517 in German. In 2017, Lutherans will commemorate 500
years of Lutheranism. In preparation for the celebrations,
Lutherans in German decided to call the 10 years from 2008
to 2017 the Luther decade. The reformation was ". . . an

The Luther Decade on Reformation and
Politics: Luther's Situational Pastoral
Advice in the Treatise on Temporal
Authority and Its Impact on the Pastoral
Mission of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in Zimbabwe (ELCZ) in a Context
of Political Violence
Herbert Moyo1
Abstract
Luther's mission in the treatise on temporal authority (TA) was to give advice to his Christian princes on good governance.
This treatise can be used as a guide on church and state relations. This article is motivated by the 2014 theme of the Luther
Decade: "The Reformation and Politics," which offers opportunities for the study of the impact of the reformation on the
politics of the then German in particular, Europe and the world in general. In this article, I retrieve and reread Martin Luther's
treatise on TA, which is the basis of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Zimbabwe's (ELCZ) understanding of the role of the
church in politics.

the 10-year span . . ." (The Luther decade). Each year in the
decade has a specific theme:

Reformation and Freedom; 2012--Reformation and Music;

2016--Reformation and the One World and 2017--Anniversary
of the Reformation (Themes for the Luther decade. http://www.
lutherland-thueringen.de/en/the-luther-decade.html).
The themes are an opportunity for theologians to engage
with the reformation in the light of contemporary realities.
The Relevance of the Discussion on the
Two Kingdoms Theory in the ELCZ
It is relevant for the ELCZ in the current Zimbabwean politi-
cal context to work on the 2014 theme by going back to
Luther's treatise on TA, which he delivered on January 1,
1523 in Wittenberg. Instead of silence because of the imag-
ined separation between the church and the state, Luther
gives pastoral advice to politicians. Luther offers pastoral
care in the form of a Bible study on good political gover-
nance. Luther implores politicians saying, "I hope . . . I may
instruct the princes and the temporal authorities in such a
way that they will remain Christians--and Christ will remain
Lord--and yet Christ's commands will not for their sake
have to become mere counsels" (Lehmann & Atkinson,
1962, p. 83; see also Lohse, 1999, p. 154). In this treatise,
Luther gives pastoral advice on good governance to politi-
cians of his time. He condemns politicians for acting as gods
by making unreasonable demands on people's conscience
and faith. On the other hand ". . . the subjects make the mis-
take of believing that they, in turn, are bound to obey their
rulers in everything . . . I shall have to resist them, at least
with words . . ." (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 83). Luther
is saying that people have no obligation to obey politicians
where there is abuse of power denigrating on human rights.
Elsewhere Luther says, "The primary loyalty of ministers of
the word is to God and not to princes or the public . . ."
(Luther -[WA]2 31, p. 189). In this treatise, Luther was advo-
cating for a theology of résistance.
What Luther acknowledges is comparable with what is
happening in current Zimbabwe and one would expect
Lutheran ministers to walk on the footsteps of Luther by giv-
ing pastoral political advice instead of silence. The impunity,
arrogance, corruption, the level of abuse of human rights,
and the level of authoritarianism that is managed through the
use of the partisan police force and the army is beyond
description. Zimbabweans including religious leaders are
controlled through fear. Yet Luther as a minister says that he
will not be terrified to silence and will resist, at least by word.
The ELCZ should be pondering on a theology of resistance
to respond to abuse of political office for self-gain at the
expense of the majority poor Zimbabweans. Luther then
goes on to issue the treatise on TA (the first form of pastoral
care to the political leadership was issued as a treatise on the
German Nobility where he spelt out the role of a Christian
prince and how they can run their office) as a form of pasto-
ral care to the TA and society at large.
It should be considered that Luther developed this treatise
while responding to his sociopolitical situation. The ELCZ3
cannot therefore use Luther's response to a given situation as
a basis for not responding to Zimbabwe's sociopolitical
situation.
The ELCZ and the Treatise on TA
The Church and State relationship debate cannot be more rel-
evant than it is in Zimbabwe from 2008 to 2014. The ELCZ
is affected in many ways by the current socioeconomic and
political downward mobility of Zimbabwe. The church as an
institution as well as individual Christians is experiencing
insurmountable challenges to the extent that the church
should respond theological to the Zimbabwean context. The
ELCZ is voiceless in the Zimbabwean political situation
claiming that the role of the church is to preach the word of
God to save souls for the heavenly kingdom, and therefore,
theologically, it cannot confuse its ministry with earthily
issues by indulging in politics. The church seems to under-
stand preaching the word to be limited to sermons delivered
on the pulpit. Saving souls then would mean salvation to go
to heaven. In the ELCZ, if one raises issues of political
involvement by the church as an institution one is reminded
of the Two Kingdoms doctrine. According to the ELCZ's
theological understanding of political ethics, it is sinful for a
pastor to be a councilor or a member of parliament. On the
other hand, the laity can hold political positions and still be
respectable members of the church. However, the separation
of political engagement from faith is suggesting that the sov-
ereignty of God over all realm of life including politics is
being called into question.
Revisiting the Treatise on TA
The "Two Kingdoms Doctrine" is the foundation for the
ELCZ's framework in designing the theology of Church and
State relations. Nürnberger observes that Luther has influ-
enced many generations of protestant thinkers. Nürnberger is
of the view that many variations of the Two Kingdoms
Doctrine are found in different denominations across the
world, and this makes Luther a popular
pivotal figure in Christian political ethics . . . But there is a
second reason as well. Seldom in history has a Christian political
ethic been so thoroughly misunderstood and abused as Luther's
Moyo 3
. . . as a result, the traditional picture of Luther's ethics . . . is that
of conservatism, uncritical acceptance of state authoritarianism
and ideological legitimation of totalitarian regimes (Nürnberger,
2005, pp. 244-245).
Practical experiences with the ELCZ and a few other denom-
inations (examples of other denominations that have ver-
sions of the Two Kingdoms theory that inhibit involvement
in politics are The Church of Christ, the Dutch Reformed
Church, the Salvation Army, Zimbabwe Assemblies of God
Africa [ZAOGA], Apostolic Faith Mission [AFM], and
Zionists) in Zimbabwe justify Nürnberger's observations
that this is often misunderstood, to the detriment of the
involvement of the church in issues of good governance and
justice. The misunderstanding is often based on the fact that
the theory is explained out of Luther's unique context which
was different from many current economic, religious, social,
and political situations (Nürnberger, 2005, pp. 244-245). It
would be fair to Luther and to the Church to understand
Luther's situation and the necessity for the theory in Luther's
time before transferring the theory to current contexts in
Africa.
The Religious-Political Context of
Luther Leading to the Treatise on TA
Luther deliberated on the issues of political governance at
the height of the explosive movement of the Reformation in
the 16th century by giving political ethical pastoral advice to
the Political Authority (PA) on good governance. As chief
initiator of the reformation, Luther was constantly called
upon to give advice and guidance to Christians in the prob-
lems of everyday life as well as advice to his disciples in the
Reformation movement and to a certain measure to his
adversaries. The treatise on TA was a response to several
concrete challenges. There was a need for Luther to clarify
his position regarding the relationship between TA and spiri-
tual authority (politics and the church).
Luther denied that spiritual authority is exempt from the
jurisdiction of TA in 1520 in An Open Letter to the Christian
Nobility (Atkinson & Lehmann, 1966, pp. 123-217; Estes,
2005, pp. 7-8). On the other hand, in 1521, at Worms, Luther
refused to comply with the order of the highest TA, the
emperor, when he was asked to disown his publications
(Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962). Luther chose to listen to God
rather than to humans. This can be seen as a form of politics
of resistance in circumstances where the PA is not in agree-
ment with the spiritual authority. The question was how
Christians should behave before the TAin the light of Luther's
teachings. How were Christians to respond to orders by rulers
forbidding them to own or read any of Luther's books includ-
ing the German translation of the New Testament? While
struggling with political orders, many of Luther's followers
had difficulties in understanding certain scriptural injunctions
such as Romans 13:1 and Matthew 5:39.
In the edict of January 20, 1522, the Imperial Council of
Regency condemned religious innovations such as commu-
nion in both kinds (bread and wine) and clerical marriage.
Copies of the edict were sent to secular and ecclesiastical
princes, who were urged to inflict severe penalties for infrac-
tions of the decree within their territories (Lehmann &
Atkinson, 1962, pp. 77-78). Luther's followers were system-
atically compelled to renounce his books while some princes
were plotting to kill Luther for which they had legal authori-
zation because of the edict of Worms (Lehmann & Atkinson,
1962). On the other hand, there were princes who were
Christians who were not sure how to relate their political
offices to Christianity. The challenge was worsened by the
interpretation, for example, of Romans 13:1 seen as in direct
contradiction of Matthew 5: 31-41. Should Christian princes
then give up their political responsibilities to become true
Christians? Should there be church and state separation?
There was wide spread religious-political unrest which
was attributed to Luther. For example, students were rioting
and communities were plundering churches and monasteries
(Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962). Luther urged his followers to
desist from physical aggression. Luther boasted that ". . . he
has done more harm to the papacy by his pen than was ever
accomplished by the violent acts of emperors, kings, and
princes" (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. xiii).
Following the above challenges, Luther wrote his 1523
treatise on Temporal Authority: To What Extent It Should Be
Obeyed. He was responding to contextual religious and
sociopolitical challenges.
Luther argues that TA originates from God, and therefore,
it is holy and should be obeyed. Luther supports his asser-
tions by giving biblical basis for TA. He also untangles the
seeming contradiction posed by different texts.
Biblical References Founding TA
(Romans 13 and I Peter 2; Scripture Is
Used According to Luther's Exegesis)
In the first part, Luther provides ". . . a sound basis for the
civil law and sword so no one will doubt that it is in the world
by God's will and ordinance" (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962,
p. 85). The central scripture is Romans 13:1ff:
Let every soul be subject to the governing authority, for there is
no authority except from God; the authority which everywhere
exists has been ordained by God. He then who resists the
governing authority resists the ordinance of God, and he who
resists God's ordinance will incur judgement.
Luther cites I Peter 2 13:14: "Be subject to every kind of
human ordinance, whether it be the king as supreme, or to
governors, as those who have been sent by him to punish the
wicked and praise the righteous." Luther seems to be advo-
cating unquestioning obedience to political authority. Still,
the point is that Luther was engaging the political situation.

This is different from being silent; he was interpreting the
Bible from the basis of his situational experiences.
Luther's Argument on TA From the
Old Testament (OT)
Luther says, ". . . the law of this temporal sword has existed
from the beginning of the world" (Lehmann & Atkinson,
1962, p. 86). Cain, after killing Abel, was afraid of being
killed until God put a special sign on his forehead to suspend
the sword (Genesis 4:14-15). Abel would not have been
afraid if Adam had not taught him about the power of TA
(Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962). After the flood, God estab-
lished the sword, "Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man
shall his blood be shed" (Genesis 9:6). The Law of Moses
also says,
If a man willfully kills another, you shall take him from my altar,
that he may die . . . a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for
a tooth, a foot for a foot, a hand for a hand, a wound for a wound,
a stripe for a stripe (Exodus 21:14, 23-25).
This was an argument to show that the PA is ordained by God
and should be obeyed as long as it obeys God.
Luther's Argument on TA From the
New Testament (NT)
In the NT, Jesus says to Peter in the Garden, "He that takes the
sword will perish by the sword" (Matt. 26:52), and to Luther,
this means the same as Genesis 9:6 (Lehmann & Atkinson,
1962, p. 87). John the Baptist, who was preaching the mes-
sage of repentance as a way of making the paths of the Lord
straight, did not condemn military service when he was asked
by soldiers what they should do in preparation for the coming
Lord. John did pastoral care by teaching soldiers military eth-
ics, "Do neither violence nor injustice to anyone, and be con-
tent with your wages" (Luke 3:14). Luther concludes that
John the Baptist was going to condemn soldiers for being sol-
diers if it was against God's will, but John taught them on
how to be good soldiers (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962).
Therefore, according to Luther, both the OT and the NT
are in agreement that God instituted TA. Luther, in engaging
in the above debate, was doing his pastoral care ministry in
his socioeconomic and pastoral situation.
Opposing Scriptural Evidence on TA
Nevertheless, there seem to be some strong arguments
against the above understanding of the divine origin of TA.
Luther acknowledges that in the sermon on the mountain
Jesus says,
You have heard that it was said of them of old:An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth. But I say to you, do not resist evil; but if
anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also
. . . And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two
miles. (Matt. 5:38ff)
Luther also cites Paul saying, "Beloved, defend not your-
selves, but leave it to the wrath of God; for it is written, `ven-
geance is mine; I will repay, says the Lord'" (Romans 12:19).
Matthew 5:44 says, "Love your enemies, do good to them
that hate you." Furthermore, Luther cites I Peter 3:9 "Do not
return evil for evil . . . ." Luther was aware that such verses
would imply that Christians were not supposed to have the
temporal sword (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, pp. 45, 87).
For the purpose of this article, it can be seen that Luther
engaged scripture to theologically respond to his political
situation.
Division of People Into Two Kingdoms
of Believers and Unbelievers
According to Luther, believers are people that believe in
Jesus and are baptized to be members of the Church.
Unbelievers are those who do not believe in Jesus including
people of other faiths. Luther says,
we must divide the children of Adam and all mankind into two
classes, the first belonging to the kingdom of God, the second to
the kingdom of the world. Those who belong to the kingdom of
God are all the true believers who are in Christ and under Christ
(Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 88).
Jesus came to the world to establish God's kingdom and
Christ showed in his sermons that His kingdom was not of
this world. Luther says, "For this reason he came into the
world, that he might begin God's kingdom and establish it in
the world" (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 88). Jesus makes
references to his kingdom in many instances such as John
18:36-37, Matthew 4:17, 10:7, and Matthew 6:33. According
to Luther, Jesus also calls the gospel "a gospel of the king-
dom of God, because it teaches, governs, and upholds God's
kingdom" (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 88). Luther goes
on to engage with the question of the position of the believer
in politics.
Luther's Discussion on Believers'
Position in Politics
According to Luther, people who belong to the kingdom of
God have no need of the temporal sword because they have
the Holy Spirit that teaches them to do justice and endure all
injustice at the hands of others. Luther argues that in a situa-
tion where there is nothing but the unadulterated doing of
right and bearing of wrong, there is no need for any law suit
or sword (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962). For this reason,
Luther would conclude that it is impossible that the PA and
law should find any work to do among Christians because
Moyo 5
they do according to their will much more than any laws can
enforce, just as Paul says in I Timothy 1:9, "The law is not
laid down for the just but for the lawless" (Lehmann &
Atkinson, 1962, p. 89).
Luther further says Christians are inclined and trained in
their nature not to seek revenge but are prepared to endure
evil and suffer injustice, hence there is no need for a system
to control or force them to behave this way. Luther uses the
analogy of a good tree, that it does not need any law or
instruction to bear good fruits; it bears good fruits by its very
nature. The law and the sword are not needed among
Christians and therefore the Sermon on the Mountain refers
to true Christians and there is no contradiction with, for
example, Romans 13:1 because according to Luther this
scripture refers to people who belong to the kingdom of the
world.
Luther goes on to raise another question: "Why, then, did
God give so many commandments . . . and why does Christ
prescribe in the gospel so many things for us to do" (Lehmann
& Atkinson, 1962, p. 89)? In response, Luther insists that the
law has been laid down for the lawless (I Tim. 1:9) so that
none of the Christians can be restrained outwardly from evil
deeds. No human is by nature righteous, and therefore, the
law is to restrain human sinfulness and wickedness (Lehmann
& Atkinson, 1962). In addition, Paul ascribes to the law
another function of teaching people to recognize sin in order
that it may make them humble unto grace and unto faith in
Christ (Romans 7:7-13 and Galatians 3:19). Furthermore,
Luther says that Christ does the same in Matthew 5:39 by
teaching that we must not resist evil; by this, he is interpret-
ing the Hebrew-Mosaic law and teaching what ought to be
the understanding of a true Christian (Lehmann & Atkinson,
1962).
Luther on Nonbelievers
Luther views nonbelievers as people who belong to the king-
dom of the world. People in the kingdom of the world are not
prepared by themselves to do what the state law demands,
". . . therefore they need the law to instruct, constrain, and
compel them to do good" (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962,
p. 89). God subjects unbelievers to the law so that they are
restrained from evil deeds, ". . . even though they would like
to, they are unable to practice their wickedness, and if they
practice it they cannot do so without fear of the sword or with
success and impunity" (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 90).
According to Luther, if there was no TA, the world would be
disorganized as unbelievers would behave like wild animals,
hence the need for restraint,
in the same way a savage wild beast is bound with chains and
ropes so that it cannot bite and tear as it would normally do, even
though it would like to, whereas a tame and gentle animal needs
no restraint, but is harmless despite the lack of chains and ropes
(Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 90).
TA helps to maintain outward worldly peace. By citing
Romans 13:3, Luther argues that the temporal sword is not a
threat to good conduct but to bad behavior. In this case,
Luther develops his thought by using an ideal typology of a
Christian as a new sinless creation that is not threatened by
the law, making it useless to Christians but valid to unbeliev-
ers. Luther uses I Peter 2:14 to substantiate that TA is for the
punishment of the wicked and the wicked are found in the
kingdom of the world and never in the kingdom of God.
On the other hand, Luther contends that there are few true
believers who do not resist evil and indeed they do not do
evil. Luther argues that anyone who tries to rule by the
Gospel only and abolish the sword will lose control of the
ropes and the chains of the savage wild beasts and let them
bite and mangle everyone, meanwhile insisting that they
were harmless creatures. Many people conceal their true
being under the pretext of being called Christians. Luther
holds that the wicked always outnumber the good and it is for
this reason that God has provided TA. He argues that, "Both
must be permitted to remain, the one to produce righteous-
ness, the other to bring about external peace and prevent evil
deeds. Neither one is sufficient in the world without the
other" (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 92). The relationship
between the two governments is complementary because,
where temporal government or law alone prevails, there sheer
hypocrisy is inevitable, even though the commandments be
God's very own . . . On the other hand, where the spiritual
government alone prevails over land and people, there
wickedness is given free rein and the door is open for all manner
of rascality. (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 92)
In light of the above, Christ's words in Matthew 5 instruct
Christians not to use the law among themselves. So the
seemingly contradictory scriptures ". . . are spoken only of
true Christians, who really do this among themselves"
(Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 93). Having said this, Luther
goes on to explain the reason why Christians are instructed
by apostles to obey TA even if they do not need it for them-
selves as advocated above.
The Distinction for Oneself and for
One's Neighbor
Luther insists that the TA or the sword "is neither necessary
nor useful" (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 94) for personal
use by Christians. Christians do not need TA and the sword
for themselves, but they can serve TA for the benefit of oth-
ers as a ceaseless gift to them and not for personal gain.
From an ethical perspective, a Christian should have more
concern for the neighbor than for the self. Luther says,
A true Christian lives and labors on earth not for himself alone
but for his neighbor. Because the sword is most beneficial and
necessary for the whole world in order to preserve peace, punish
6 SAGE Open
sin, and restrain the wicked . . . (A Christian) pays his taxes,
honors those in authority . . . and does all he can to assist the
governing authority that it may function and be held in honor
(Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 94).
The Christian submits to and supports the temporal sword
willingly for the services it renders to society. So the Church
should support the PA for the services it renders to society.
Luther says that the services of the TA are essential and nec-
essary for the benefit of others (Ephesians 5:21-6:9).
Luther observes that Christians do a lot of works of love
that they do not need themselves such as visiting the sick and
feeding the hungry. In the same way, Christians serve the gov-
erning authority not because they need it but for the sake of
others that they may be protected. Christians do not lose any-
thing by serving and honoring the governing authority in the
spirit of love for others. Luther refers to Matthew 17:27 as an
example that Jesus paid the half-shekel tax that he might not
offend the political authority, even though he had no need to
do so. Christians are by their nature expected to do pastoral
care to others including doing so through the political
authority.
Luther observes in the words of Christ in Matthew 5 that
Christians among themselves should have no temporal
sword. Jesus does not, however, forbid one to serve and be
subject to those who do have the secular sword. Luther says,
Christ does not say, "you shall not serve the governing authority
or be subject to it," but rather, "Do not resist an evil person"
(Matt. 5:39), as much as to say, "Behave in such a way that you
bear everything, so that you may not need the governing
authority to help you and serve you or be beneficial or essential
for you, but that you in turn may help and serve it, being
beneficial and essential to it. I would have you be too exalted
and far too noble to have any need of it; it should rather have
need of you" (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 95).
At this point, Luther sees it as a Christian virtue to serve
and honor the governing authority for peace and justice in
the kingdom of the world. Christians have a duty to protect
human rights and human dignity. Christians should serve the
government when it upholds peace and justice. If the PAdoes
not uphold peace and justice, Christians have no obligation
to serve such a political authority. Peace and justice for all
means equal dignity and protection by the law. Peace means
lack of disharmony enabling each person to develop to their
full potential without hindrances from other citizens or from
the state.
The Hebrew word for peace is shalom. It is a comprehensive
concept that means wholeness, joy, freedom, reconciliation,
community, harmony of all creation--both physical and
spiritual, righteousness, truth, justice, communication. (http://
www.cofchrist.org/peace/).
Furthermore, "Shalom is holistic and embraces all persons
and all creation . . ." (http://www.cofchrist.org/peace/).
Justification for Bearing the Sword by
Christians
Luther says that the sword has no place among Christians
because by virtue of the principles and values of their faith
they do not it (the sword). However, Christians are obliged to
serve and assist the sword by whatever means (Lehmann &
Atkinson, 1962, p. 95), for the sake of the world and one's
neighbor. Therefore, Christians can become civil servants as
a channel of service and servant-hood for the maintenance of
safety and peace for others. The Christian, at a personal level,
would be controlled by the gospel and submit to the PA
according to Christ's word (Matt. 5:39-40). In this way, the
seemingly contradictions are harmonized enabling the
Christian to satisfy both inwardly and outwardly the king-
dom of God. The Christian outwardly suffers evil and injus-
tice while punishing evil and injustice, by not resisting evil,
and yet at the same time resisting it (Lehmann & Atkinson,
1962). According to Luther, this shows how Christians can
bear the sword among non-Christians in a Christian manner.
The Limits of TA
Having argued that TA has divine origins and is religiously
justifiably to be honored even by Christians, Luther goes on
to teach about the limits of TA. One of the challenges was that
bishops and princes wanted to use TA to counter heresy and
Luther felt that they were interfering where their authority
was not required.
It is important for Christians to know the limits of TA;
otherwise, it encroached upon God's kingdom (Lehmann &
Atkinson, 1962, p. 45). The two governments, the temporal
government and the spiritual government, according to Luther,
have two different kinds of law. Every kingdom must have its
own laws and constitution for the regulation of its affairs. In
this case, according to Luther, one can justifiably talk about
the political/civil use of the law as mandated to the TA, while
the theological use of the law is mandated to the church.
The Theological Use of the Law
Luther postulates that the theological use of the law belongs
to the kingdom of God under the kingship of Christ. In this
kingdom, God cannot allow anyone to rule the soul other than
Himself. The soul is the center of the human relationship with
God and this has nothing to do with TA. Luther says that any
man-made laws regarding the soul or spiritual life cannot be
said to be coming from God and therefore should not be used
as if they come from God. Man-made laws should be used
knowingly that they come from humans for worldly peace.
Therefore, anyone else who claims to rule the soul or forces
the soul to believe anything without the word of God will be
misleading the soul and at the same time committing a sin
(Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962). It is true from experience that
if another ruler imposes regulations in another kingdom, that
ruler will be violating territorial regulations and the king of
Moyo 7
the violated kingdom will resist in some way. In matters that
concern the Christian's relationship with God and the salva-
tion of souls, Luther would not accept anything other than
God's word when he says,
. . . it is the height of folly when they command that one shall
believe the church, the fathers, and the councils, though there be
no word of God for it . . . "Whoever speaks, let him speak as the
word of God" (I Pet. 4:11) . . . we are not baptised into kings . . .
but into Christ and God himself . . . Therefore, in matters which
concern the salvation of souls, nothing but God's word shall be
taught and accepted. (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 106)
The kingdom of God deals with the soul, PA has no power
to control the internal because it cannot see the heart. It is
God alone who can see the heart of human beings. Luther
thinks that it is illogical for the PA to be concerned about the
soul because it cannot kill it or give it life and because TAhas
no control over the soul. It (TA) cannot destine souls to
heaven or to hell. Luther says,
We cannot conceive how an authority could or should act in a
situation except where it can see . . . That is reserved for God
alone, as Psalm 7:9 says, "God tries the hearts and reigns" . . .
the thoughts and inclinations of the soul can be known to no one
but God (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, pp. 106-107).
The PA cannot govern the spiritual realm even if it so
wished, ". . . how dare the mad temporal authority judge and
control such a secret, spiritual, hidden matter as faith"
(Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 108).
The soul is a matter between the individual and God who
teaches through the gospel and the Holy Spirit to make
humans aware of their sins. The theological use of the law
divulges that humans are sinners. Luther's interpretation of
the law in a theological sense is based on Deuteronomy 6:5ff,
"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and
with all your soul, and with all your might . . . ." This implies
that the whole human being should be directed to God.
However, this is not the case; humans have a tendency to do
wrong and are inwardly accused by God through the gospel.
The law in the kingdom of God inwardly accuses sinning in
the heart, in the soul and in the mind (Lohse, 1999).
Lohse (1999) describes Luther's understanding of the
theological use of law by saying that the theological use of
the law is the ultimate task of the law as it introspectively
convicts individuals of their wrongdoing before God and
their neighbors. The theological use of the law convicts indi-
viduals and then goes on to torment their hearts as it seeks
internal repentance without force from TA (See Gritsch &
Lehmann, 1970; Luther 39, p. 456-457).
Such internal expositions of being inwardly inclined to
sin prepare the inner being for longing for the gospel and
forgiveness of sins to produce righteousness. According to
Luther, the law shows humans what they ought to be, but
what they are not able to be on their own, and the law is also
not able to make humans what they ought to be unless God
redeems them through Christ. The spiritual government does
not enforce decrees by physical force, it uses the gospel
(word and sacraments) through the power of the Holy Spirit
given through grace and accepted by faith alone. When
accepted by God through Christ, we then participate in the
righteousness of God in the strength of being served by
Jesus.
The Political Use of the Law
The political use of the law is exercised through political
authority, affecting the outward human being. At times, tem-
poral laws affect the spiritual law. For example, Daniel,
Meshach, Shadrach, and Abednego had their religious con-
victions challenged by temporal law (Daniel 3:1-30). This
aspect is meant to structure visible human life by protecting
and promoting good while limiting and punishing wrong.
This brings about order and peace, but it cannot control
thoughts and feelings, hence the need for the theological use
of the law. Lohse (1999) says,
By means of the political use, external order on earth is to be
maintained, and the peace and the securing of justice preserved.
Thelawalsohasthetaskofinculcatingthedivinecommandments
and of instructing consciences. It also is to furnish the needed
means by which to punish evildoers (p. 271).
Luther does not limit the political use of the law to political
governance but extends it to parents, teachers, and institu-
tions of learning. In his treatise To the Councilmen of All
Cities in Germany that they establish and maintain Christian
schools (1524; Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, pp. 339-378),
Luther appealed to the PA to establish Christian schools for
molding good boys and girls so as to have good learned citi-
zens for the future of the nation. Estes says that Luther,
advised the elector that all the abandoned monasteries and
foundations had automatically fallen under his authority as
prince and he thus had the duty . . . put their affairs in order, and
see to it that their resources were to support those churches and
schools not otherwise adequately endowed with income.
Moreover, he attributed to the elector, as "supreme guardian of
the younger generation," the power to compel communities who
had the wherewithal to do so to "support schools, preacherships,
and parishes" just as one would compel them "to contribute to
. . . the building of bridges and roads, or any other of the
country's needs." Otherwise "the land will be filled with wild,
loose-living people" (Estes, 2005, p. 46).
The civil use of the law has to do with how people relate
to one another and their environment in everyday life, while
the theological use of the law has to do with humanity's rela-
tionship with God through relating to one another. Luther is
teaching both religious leaders and political leaders. Luther
also engaged with the challenge of the role of Bishops.
8 SAGE Open
The Roles of Bishops and Princes
Luther challenged Bishops and Princes who confused their
spirituality with their political authority. Such princes would
use TA to promote their spiritual roles and at the same time
use spiritual authority to protect their TA.
For my ungracious Lords, the pope and the bishops, are supposed
to be bishops and preach God's word. This they leave undone,
and have become temporal princes who govern with laws which
concern only life and property. They are supposed to be ruling
souls inwardly by God's word; so they rule castles, cities, lands,
and people outwardly, torturing souls with unspeakable outrages.
(Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 109)
The temporal lords on the other hand are supposed to gov-
ern lands and people outwardly, but unfortunately they are
not doing this. Luther criticizes them strongly, saying that
instead they strip and fleece, making people pay many unrea-
sonable taxes (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962).
There is no more any justice, integrity, or truth to be found
among them. They behave worse than any thief or scoundrel . . .
For this reason God perverts their mind also, that they rush on
into the absurdity of trying to exercise a spiritual rule over souls,
just as their counterparts try to establish a temporal rule.
(Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 109)
Governors should know their sphere of authority; other-
wise, they are sinning against God if they overstep their man-
date. According to Luther, they are heaping alien sins upon
themselves thereby incurring the anger of God and hatred of
man, ". . . until they come to reign together with bishops,
popes, and monks, one scoundrel with the other" (Lehmann
& Atkinson, 1962, p. 110).
The Meaning of Scripture on Issues
of TA in Relationship to the Spiritual
Authority
Luther uses Romans 13:1 and I Peter 2:13. He says that tem-
poral obedience and authority applies to external issues of
the law such as taxes and honor where human beings can ". . .
see, know, judge, evaluate, punish, and acquit" (Lehmann &
Atkinson, 1962, pp. 110-111).
Jesus Christ in Matthew 22:21 says, "Render to Caesar
the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are
God's." External things such as body, property, and the con-
ferring of honors are under the authority of Caesar and he has
control over them, while on the other hand, spiritual things
and the soul are under Christ.
Luther gives an example from Psalms when King David
said, "He has given heaven to the Lord of heaven, but the
earth he has given to the sons of men" (Psalm 113 and
115:16). To strengthen his argument, Luther says God said,
"Let us make man to have dominion over the beasts of the
earth, the fish of the sea, and the birds of the air" (Genesis
1:26). According to Luther, scriptures clearly show that the
external dimension is given to humanity, while the spiritual
dimension remains under God's business. Peter in Acts 5:29
says, "We must obey God rather than men." To Luther, this
"clearly sets a limit to the temporal authority, for if we had to
do everything that the temporal authority wanted there would
have been no point in saying, `We must obey God rather than
men'" (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 111). This argument,
according to Luther, gives power to those who are being gov-
erned to denounce political authorities that encroach on the
kingdom of God. Christians should obey PA if it justly serves
the people; however, if it abuses the rights of citizens it is
supposed to be protecting and serving, then the church should
denounce it and obey God.
Wisdom Expected of a Christian Prince
(Politician)
According to Luther, a Christian prince should use TAjust like
any other Christian would use it for the benefit of the neighbor
and not for self-gain. A Christian prince is to exercise servant-
hood leadership in political governance. Leadership should be
directed at the benefit of others who otherwise would not have
benefitted anything had it not been for one's good leadership
(Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 118).
A prince should understand the law and good common
sense at the same time. The law must be used with firmness,
reasoning, and Christian wisdom. In making judgments, a
good prince will use discretion in applying the law depend-
ing on the context of the accused or the accuser. For no mat-
ter how good and impartial the laws are, they all make an
exception in the case of necessity, in the face of which they
cannot insist upon being strictly enforced. Therefore, a prince
must have the law as firmly in hand as the sword, and deter-
mine in his own mind when and where the law is to be
applied strictly or with moderation so that the law may pre-
vail at all times and in all cases, and reason must be the high-
est law and the master of all administration of law (Lehmann
& Atkinson, 1962). On this same note, punishment should be
exercised without causing injury to others. At times, the
prince, depending on the possible consequences, should be
able to ignore some offences, "He cannot govern who cannot
wink at faults" (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 124).
If the prince lacks the requisite wisdom to the point of
entirely depending upon advisors and law books, then that
land will be doomed. Such a prince should take the example
of King Solomon, who turned to God for wisdom to govern
well (I Kings 3:9). If he then governs accordingly, God will
grant him the ability to carry out all actions in a proper godly
manner (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962). This way, he should
picture Christ to himself, and say,
Christ . . . came to serve me; he did not seek to gain power, estate,
and honor and from me, but considered only my need, and
Moyo 9
directed all things to the end that I should gain power, estate, and
honor from him and through him. I will do likewise, seeking from
my subjects not my own advantage but theirs. I will use my office
to serve and protect them, listen to their problems and defend
them, and govern to the sole end that they, not I, may benefit and
profit from my rule (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 120).
This is what Christ did in Philippians 2:7, and these are
proper works of a Christian prince. Luther understands lord-
ship as servant-hood to all and master to none. A Christian
prince should therefore be a servant to all his subjects, and
this will take away most of the prevalent pleasures of prince
hood resulting in self-sacrifice. Elsewhere, Luther says, "The
second virtue of a prince is to help the poor, the orphans, and
the widows to justice, and to further their cause" (Lehmann
& Atkinson, 1962, p. 53). In other words, a prince should be
an advocate for the vulnerable.
Christian Politicians on the Use of
Advisors
Following on the issue of wisdom, Luther says that a prince
should not depend completely upon advisers.Aprince should
practice control over appointees by delegating certain duties
but should not completely entrust decision making to them.
". . . A prince should trust his officials and allow them to act,
but only in such a way that he will keep the reins of govern-
ment in his own hands . . . " (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p.
121) because the failure of the appointees is the responsibil-
ity of the prince. Humans are not trustworthy unless they are
filled with the Holy Spirit (see Gritsch & Lehmann, 1970).
Since one cannot know whether the Prince's appointed advis-
ers are faithful Christians and trustworthy or not or how long
they will remain so hence the danger of complete depen-
dence on them. Even if one professes to be a Christian, you
cannot know because there are many who profess to be
Christian when in actual fact they are not, judging by their
sinfulness. Luther gives the example of King David and
Ahithophel. Luther observes that David had a wise coun-
selor, Ahithophel whose advice was comparable with con-
sulting God. However, Ahithophel betrayed David and
taught him that no advisor is to be completely trusted (II
Samuel 16:23). However, God can be relied upon absolutely
and will not let one down, whereas even if one wants to rely
on humans absolutely, they are not totally reliable.
Luther's Advice to Christian Politicians
on Warfare
On the question of whether a prince should go to war and
whether citizens should follow him, Luther said that the
prince should use wisdom in deciding on whether to go to
war or not. Furthermore, it depends upon the context; simi-
larly, the subjects of the prince can join or refuse to join the
prince in waging a war depending upon the context. Luther
says that a prince should not go to war against his king;
instead, the prince should offer confession and be prepared to
suffer wrong for God's sake. The prince should also offer
peace and justice to whoever wants to go to war with them
(Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962).
In this case, a prince invokes the temporal sword to pro-
tect his subjects and territory for the benefit of his people
rather than himself and ". . . when victory has been achieved,
one should offer mercy and peace to those who surrender and
humble themselves" (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 125).
Luther goes on to answer one of the most challenging situa-
tions in people's relationship with their kings. "What if the
prince is wrong? Are his people bound to follow him? No,
for it is no one's duty to do wrong; we must obey God rather
than men (Acts 5:29)" (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 125).
However, if subjects do not know whether their prince is
wrong they have to obey and this will not be considered as a
sin by God. Luther goes on to say, "A prince must act in a
Christian way toward his God also; that is, he must subject
himself to Him in entire confidence and pray for wisdom to
rule well, as Solomon did (I Kings 3:9)" (Lehmann &
Atkinson, 1962, p. 126).
In light of the above pastoral advice by Luther to
Christian princes, should the ELCZ not give practical polit-
ical theological based advice to the government in situa-
tions like when Zimbabwe went to war in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC)? According to Blair, "When
civil war erupted in the DRC in August 1998, Mugabe
decided that Zimbabwe must intervene. The parlous state of
his treasury meant that no money was available.
Nonetheless, he ended up sending 11, 000 troops" (Blair,
2003, p. 41). Luther's advice could also have been useful in
giving pastoral advice during the war in which Zimbabwe
was involved in Mozambique in the 1980s. On the 27th of
August 1985, Zimbabwe deployed troops in the Gorongoza
area of Mozambique to fight against the RENAMO, which
was destabilizing Mozambique. This was justified by the
argument that the troops were guarding the Beira Corridor
through which Zimbabwe accesses crude oil through the
Feruka oil pipe line. The ELCZ could have based its practi-
cal advice on Luther's advice on war by a political leader
instead of silence.
The Law of Love and Restitution
According to Luther, cases of restitution are what the tempo-
ral sword is commonly concerned with. There is no better
law than the law of love. In the case of restitution of goods
wrongfully acquired, Luther advises,
If they are both Christians the matter is soon settled; neither will
withhold what belongs to the other, and neither will demand that
it be returned. If only one of them is a Christian, namely, the one
to whom restitution is due, it is again easy to settle, for he does
not care whether restitution is ever made to him. The same is
10 SAGE Open
true if the one who is supposed to make restitution is a Christian,
for he will do so (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 127).
In the above case, the Christian will be acting justly for the
benefit of the neighbor. This should also have raised some
theological pastoral debates in the ELCZ on the Land ques-
tion, such as, What about the application of this idea of restitu-
tion in Zimbabwe between the colonialists and Zimbabweans
who were dispossessed of their land? Conversely, one can ask
what about restitution to White commercial farmers who have
been dispossessed of their land since 2000 by government
without compensation? Were the colonialists Christian? Are
Zimbabweans Christian? Would this kind of law of love and
restitution be applicable in the Zimbabwean political situa-
tion? Debating these restitution issues by the ELCZ based on
the teachings of Luther could have helped the church to mean-
ingfully engage in the political situation. In no way does the
teaching outlined by Luther advocate silence by the church.
Luther goes on to give an example full of Christian love
where the offended party is considerate of the welfare of the
offender despite the offence. He says,
If the debtor is poor and unable to make restitution, and the other
part is not poor, then you should let the law of love prevail and
acquit the debtor; for according to the law of love the other party is
in any event obliged to relinquish the debt and, if necessary, to give
him something besides. But if the debtor is not poor, then have him
restore as much as he can, whether it be all, a half, a third, or a
fourth of it, provided that you leave him enough to assure a house,
food, and clothing for himself, his wife, and his children . . . if
neither part is a Christian, or if one of them is unwilling to be
judged by the law of love, then you may have them call in some
other judge, and tell the obstinate one that they are acting contrary
to God and natural law, even if they obtain a strict judgement in
terms of human law (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, pp. 127-128).
To further his argument, Luther cites Luke 6:31 as an
example of what love teaches us on how to treat others, as we
would like to be treated ourselves. Luther argues that one's
rights in the law of love can be suspended for the sake of the
other. Love and natural law can be used in dealing with cases
both in the private and in the public domain leading to just
judgments without the use of law books (Lehmann &
Atkinson, 1962). Luther goes on to say:
But when you ignore love and natural law you will never hit
upon the solution that pleases God . . . A good and just decision
must not and cannot be pronounced out of books, but must come
from a free mind, as though there were no books. Such a free
decision is given, however, by love and by natural law, with
which all reason is filled. (Lehmann & Atkinson, 1962, p. 128)
In this case, Nürnberger (2005) says,
Luther knew of only one guiding principle for our lives and that
was self-giving love of Christ. Love demands responsibility for
the welfare of one's fellow human beings. If a Prince wanted to
be a Christian, he had to follow this rule whether in his private
capacity or in his political decision making (p. 252).
Natural and biblical law of love seems to agree with Luther's
point of view because they both lead to the golden rule. Love
protects the rights and needs of the offender and the offended
justly in a way that pleases God.
Conclusion
Luther advocated that TA is meant for evildoers, those who
belong to the kingdom of the world. Christians do not need
TA for their own benefit but for the love of the neighbor. In
temporal matters, the TA has a divinely instituted right to be
obeyed, but when it comes to matters of faith, it is only the
gospel that is supreme, and TA has no power. It is the duty of
Christians to support the governance activities of TA, which
are instituted by God.
In developing the above theological discourses on TA,
Luther was engaging with the TA in his context. Luther gives
pastoral advice on good political governance advice to the
political authority. According to Luther, there is no room for
silence by the spiritual authority in relation to the TA. The
ELCZ should be propelled to intervene where there is abuse
of human rights because of the love of the neighbor. In
Zimbabwe, the gospel of love for the neighbor can be a tool
for reconciliation and political tolerance.
This treatise also raises restitution issues that resonate
with the situation faced by Zimbabweans. Restitution is an
ongoing debate in Zimbabwe pertaining to the land ques-
tion, mineral resources, and businesses. The government
wants to take away the above from Whites and give them
to Blacks without restitution to current owners. The church
can give advice to Christians in government as well as
non-Christians who are in danger of being dispossessed.
The treatise also gives advice to a Christian prince on when
and why one has to engage in a war. This advice can be
used as a basis by the ELCZ in advising government when
it participates in regional conflicts or when there is war
between the government and its own citizens as has been
the trend in current Zimbabwe. This treatise is a spring-
board for political engagement in a pastoral manner by the
church.
