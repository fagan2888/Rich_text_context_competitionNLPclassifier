Introduction
In teaching, it is required that the environment, instructional
materials, and interactions with learners be appropriate for
teaching and learning. This is perceived as responding to the
learners' interest and needs. In every classroom, some chil-
dren need special attention and planning for them to be able
to meet up to the teachers'expectations. However, some chil-
dren lack pre-requisite skills and knowledge, which are
appropriate for their age. Such children are referred to as
"learning-disabled" children. Learning is an enduring change
in the way an organism responds based on the organism's
experiences (Drew, 2002). Therefore, learning has to do with
change in behavior due to environmental and developmental
influences. For Igbo (2012), learning is knowledge facili-
tated through experiences within the school and outside the
school environments. Learning is seen as internal events that
go inside the students' brain.
For Kuppuswamy (2010), learning is the process by
which an organism, as a result of its interaction with a situa-
tion, acquires a new mode of behavior, which tends to persist
and affect the general behavioral pattern of the organism to
some degree.
The ability to create learning connections through the
application of teacher-made instructional materials are the
skills through which children develop new combinations and
relationships in organizing ideas, symbols, objects, and
words (Charlesworth, 1996). Ordinarily, teacher-made
instructional materials create curiosity for the learning-dis-
abled child who may seize this opportunity to explore and
create. These abilities to explore and create often tend to
increase the children's knowledge and cognitive
development.
Children learn a lot from their teachers through the pro-
cess of applying instructional materials. Bello (1999) is of
the opinion that the provision and utilization of teacher-made
instructional materials will promote the intellectual ability of
children. Probably, this is because instructional materials act
as motivator to the children and will equally awaken their
interest, more especially children with learning disabilities.
Learning disabilities refer to certain kinds of disorders in
the basic psychological process of individuals. These disor-
ders have to do with intrinsic factors such as specific defects
in information processing or the ability to learn (Mangal,
2011). The disorders manifest with significant difficulties in
language acquisition and ability to solve simple mathemati-
cal problems. Such children are not as efficient as their class-
mates or age-mates without learning difficulties.
Generally, learning disability is a broad terminology that
is used to cover different conditions whose major character-
istic is significant impairment of mental functioning.
Learning disabilities are described differently all over the
world. This implies that there is no consensus or agreement

Perceived Efficacy of Teacher-Made
Instructional Materials in Promoting
Learning Among Mathematics-Disabled
Children
Janet N. Igbo1 and Joachim C. Omeje1
Abstract
The study explored the perceived efficacy of teacher-made instructional materials in promoting learning among mathematics-
disabled children in the primary school. One research question and one hypothesis were used to guide the study. The sample
for the study comprised of 155 primary 5 mathematics-disabled pupils, and the study area was central education zone.
Questionnaire was the instrument used for data collection. Mean, standard deviation, and t-test statistics were used in the
analysis of the data. Results indicated that pupils prefer visual aids, recall better, learn faster, achieve more, and prefer contact
with teacher-made instructional materials, among other items.

on the definition of learning disabilities. Recently, children
with learning difficulties have been referred to as handi-
capped, subnormal, or retarded. In short, all children with
intellectual deficits, however profound, are referred to as
learning-disabled children (Bennett, 2011). The explanation
of this is that learning-disabled children are children with
learning difficulties, no matter how minor or severe the
learning problem might be.
Learning disability is a type of helplessness or handicap
that can be felt by the learner in terms of his or her academic
performance in the same way as experienced by a mentally
disabled child in terms of his or her mental functioning
(Mangal, 2011). This implies that learning-disabled children
are children who undergo extra stress in learning. These are
children who have difficulties in their academic perfor-
mances, in spite of the fact that they are not mentally
impaired, do not lack learning opportunities, and have no
emotional difficulties or problems.
Mathematics is important in the life of every individual.
This is because individuals come in contact with mathemat-
ics directly or indirectly as they interact with people. For the
National Institute of Mental Health United States (1990),
mathematics has to do with the recognition of facts, under-
standing abstract concepts such as fractions and place values.
Mathematics disability can be attached to a number of fac-
tors running from individual perception, problems in cogni-
tive functioning, and inappropriate instruction. Therefore,
mathematics disability has to do with pupils' inability to co-
ordinate properly.
Garofalo and Lester (1985) listed four categories of activ-
ities involved in mathematics problem solving as orientation,
organization, execution, and verification. This implies that
for a child to operate appropriately in mathematics, the child
requires these qualities.
For the purpose of this study, mathematics-disabled chil-
dren are children who operate 2 years below the standard
from their classmates. In addition, the continuous assessment
scores were equally used as a criterion for declaring children
as mathematics disabled.
Teacher-made instructional materials are constructed
teaching materials developed by teachers in their respective
subjects or subject areas for easy teaching and learning.
Otuka (2004) sees teacher-made instructional materials as
improvised teaching materials. In this case, the teacher acts
as the improviser by composing instructional or teaching
materials that will make teaching and learning easy. It
involves the ability of the teacher to make or invent teaching
materials in the absence of already made instructional mate-
rials for the purpose of meaningful interaction between the
teacher and the learners in the classroom.
Teacher-made instructional materials are the teaching
resources that are purposely designed by the teacher or by
both teacher and pupils mainly to promote meaningful teach-
ing and learning in the classroom (Crawford, 2003). These
are usually teacher-initiated instructional materials which are
used to facilitate teaching and learning processes. Going by
this definition, teacher-made instructional materials will
have some positive effect on mathematics-disabled children
and will also improve their level of understanding in class-
room situations under which teaching process usually take
place. This means that teacher-made instructional materials
will foster or boost the learners' cognitive learning
processes.
Teacher-made instructional materials can provide the
driving force or incentive for children to explore and dis-
cover already stated objectives. This can be acquired by the
manipulation of these instructional materials and will boost
the interest of children toward achieving the stated objec-
tives. Changing the pattern of teaching and learning by
applying these teacher-made materials will excite learning-
disabled children and make them explore, by being creative
and seeking for what is new in the usage of teacher-made
instructional materials.
Thompson (2001) has also observed that the application
of instructional materials tend to sustain and attract chil-
dren's attention, and make teaching and learning more inter-
esting irrespective of the gender.
Gender means culturally specified assignments or post of
traits and roles to human beings. Culturally, in some coun-
tries, there are roles expected from girls and boys, respec-
tively. According to Martin and Osborne (1992), the process
begins with labels. For instance an infant is called a boy or a
girl and dressed in blue or pink, respectively. These affect
children directly or indirectly even in their academic perfor-
mances and academic achievements. In a study carried out
by Mbajiogu F.O.(2002) on male and female students'
achievement in biology, the findings indicated that male stu-
dents performed better than their female counterparts. It is
assumed that with the application of teacher-made instruc-
tional materials, the possibility of both girls and boys improv-
ing is not ruled out. Besides, the difference in their academic
achievement might not be significant.
Stone and Michael (1986) carried out a study on objects
sorting on mathematics-disabled children. The researchers
used tasks ranging from objects sorting and concept attain-
ment to more complex hypothesis testing. The findings indi-
cated that mathematics-disabled children struggled to
identify critical attributes in tasks and are ineffective in their
use of feedback.
In another study carried out by Otto and Smith (1980) on
objects sorting in mathematics, the findings indicated that
during the pre-primary and primary years, many children
cannot sort objects by size, match objects, understand the
language of mathematics, or grasp the concept of rational
counting.
In a study carried out by Young (2003) on the application
of cartoons in teaching Grades 6 to 9 students, the findings
indicated that cartoons acted as visual aid and equally
increased the learning achievement acquired by students. If
this is so, the implication is that teacher-made instructional
Igbo and Omeje 3
materials that are mostly visual teaching aid will go a long
way in minimizing the mathematics disability of children in
the primary school.
According to the findings of Olaitan,S.O. and Akpan, A.E
(2003) and Weikart,P.P. (2000) on teaching strategies, evi-
dences indicate that learning processes carried out through
teacher-made instructional materials such as visual aids,
flash cards, pictures, and cards have been effectively used in
teaching and learning at pre-primary and primary school lev-
els. Therefore, most of the findings on the efficacy of teacher-
made instructional materials were from outside Nigeria.
From literatures reviewed so far, it is obvious that the
effective application of teacher-made instructional materials
is important and needs to be addressed in Nigeria, with par-
ticular reference to mathematics-disabled children. If this
problem is addressed appropriately, it might reduce or mini-
mize mathematics disabilities among children in Nigeria.
This is the thrust of the study.
The study examined the perceived efficacy of teacher-
made instructional materials in the promotion of learning
among mathematics-disabled children. Specifically, the
study determines the perceived efficacy of teacher-made
instructional materials in promoting learning among primary
5 mathematics-disabled pupils. The following research ques-
tion guided the study:
Research Question 1: What is the perceived efficacy of
teacher-made instructional material in promoting learning
among primary 5 mathematics-disabled children?
Hypothesis 1: One hypothesis tested at .05 level of sig-
nificance guided the study.

: There is no significant difference between the mean
ratings of male and female pupils with regard to perceived
efficacy of teacher-made instructional materials among
mathematics-disabled pupils.
Method
The study applied survey design. This is because it involves
assessing opinions, preferences, and perceptions (Cohen,
Manion, & Morrison, 2011). The survey design was used for
gathering data on pupils' opinions and perceptions on effi-
cacy of teacher-made instructional materials.
The study was carried out in Nsukka Central Education
Zone, which is made up of five sub-zones: Enugu Road,
Odenigbo, Leja, Obimo, and Obukpa sub-zones. The area
was chosen because of the poor learning attitudes, which cre-
ated mathematics problems for the pupils. Therefore, the
researchers examined whether teacher-made instructional
materials will help enhance learning among mathematics-
disabled children.
The population of the study was 155 primary 5 learning-
disabled pupils in Nsukka Central Education Zone (Source:
Nsukka Central Education Authority). This is made up of 82
male and 73 female pupils. The teachers identified these
pupils as mathematics-disabled children based on their
yearly performances. It is expected that at primary 5, pupils
must have acquired mathematics skills.
Random sampling technique was adopted in selecting 25
primary schools for the study. Purposive sampling technique
was adopted to select the mathematics-disabled children in
the schools selected. There were altogether 155 mathemat-
ics-disabled children who were identified by their teachers in
the schools, and all the pupils were involved in the study. In
identifying the mathematics-disabled children, the research-
ers involved the teachers who provided the continuous
assessment records of the children. The researchers requested
from the teachers to select those children who were experi-
encing mathematics disabilities. This was provided by the
teachers based on the pupils' continuous assessment records.
These children were selected based on the pupils' uneven
performances across the school subjects and particularly in
mathematics.
Instrument and Method of Data Analysis
The technique for data collection was through question-
naires. The cut-off point for the decision making was 2.5.
Therefore, 2.5 and above were regarded as acceptable for the
perceived efficacy level of the teacher-made instructional
materials. Mean and standard deviation were used in answer-
ing the research question, while t-test was used to test the
hypothesis.
In collecting the data, 155 copies of the questionnaire
were personally distributed to the pupils by the researchers
with the help of two research assistants. Copies of the ques-
tionnaire were distributed to the pupils almost immediately.
Two research assistants helped the researchers in the distri-
bution and retrieval of the questionnaire. The return rate was
100%.
The instrument was face validated by three experts in
educational psychology guidance and counseling and an
expert in measurement and evaluation all from the University
of Nigeria, Nsukka. Some items were deleted while some
were restructured to meet the standard.
The researchers subjected the validated instrument to trial
testing with 20 primary 5 mathematics-disabled pupils in
Enugu Urban. These pupils are outside the research area. To
ascertain the internal consistency of the instrument
Cronbach's alpha was used. The Cronbach's coefficient for
the internal consistency was 0.78. Mean and standard devia-
tion were used in answering the research question, while
t-test was applied in testing the hypothesis.
Results
From the table, the data indicate that 15 items out of 18 items
have mean scores that range from 2.83 through 3.68. The
indication is that, there is a general acceptance of the items
on the application of teacher-made instructional materials as
4 SAGE Open
a way for enhancing teaching and learning among the learn-
ing-disabled children in the primary schools studied.
However, only 3 items have indications of "disagree."
The mean score is above the criterion mean of 2.5.
Therefore, the means scores are evidence that teacher-made
instructional materials can help enhance learning among the
learning-disabled children.
The data on Table 2 indicate that male pupils had a mean
score of 3.00 while the female pupils had a mean score of
3.15. The data were analyzed using t-test analysis, to enable
the researcher find out whether there is a significant differ-
ence existing between the rating of male and female pupils.
The result indicates that there was no significant difference
between the mean rating of male and female pupils in their
perception of teacher-made instructional materials. This is
simply because the result is less than a .05 level of signifi-
cance by which the hypothesis was tested. This implies that
the effect due to gender is not significant at the .05 level of
significance. Therefore, the null hypothesis is accepted.
Discussion
The purpose of the study was to ascertain the perception of
primary school children on the use of teacher-made instruc-
tional materials. The results revealed that teachers enrich the
performance of learning-disabled children by utilizing
teacher-made instructional materials in teaching. This could
be attributed to the fact that the children came in contact with
the teaching materials. They had the opportunity to see, feel,
and sometimes touch the objects and this might have appealed
to their various sense organs. In addition, the results indi-
cated that pupils feel comfortable and relaxed whenever
teacher-made instructional materials were used. They learn
faster, achieve more, and prefer contact with teacher-made
instructional materials. This is in line with Gillingham and

Stillman (1970) who found that seeing and hearing tend to
stimulate the sense organs and make the child learn more
effectively by practice.
The finding is also in line with the recent study by Bennett
(2011), who found that coming in contact with teacher-made
instructional materials is an opportunity for children with learn-
ing difficulties to gain communication skills. The results of the
grand mean score of 3.09, with the criterion bench mark of
2.50, is evidence on the influence of teacher-made instructional
materials. The above result is also in line with the finding of
Igbo (2006) that the use of real objects in the teaching of learn-
ing-disabled children is very effective and highly significant.
On the male and female pupils taught using teacher-made
instructional materials, the finding revealed that there is no
significant difference in the mean ratings. This is in line with
the findings of Thompson (2001) and Bello (1999), who
found no difference in the achievement of children based on
gender. This finding could be attributed to the fact that both
male and female pupils were all taught under the same envi-
ronment and condition by the teachers. When this is achieved,
the teacher has successfully made learning connections
through the teacher-made instructional materials. For the fact
that the teaching materials are created by the teacher, he or
she ensures that the environment is not threatening and learn-
ing becomes easier. Teachers are always ready to take steps
and learning becomes easier to increase motivation and con-
tinuous desire for the learners to learn from the new situation
which the teacher has created. Usually, when education
involves the processes of constructing physical and logical
mathematical evidences, the teacher's role is more of facili-
tating learning and initiating the instruction.
Generally, the findings revealed that among the 18 items
stated, 16 items were agreed on by the respondents as items
that could help in the process of learning using teacher-made
instructional materials in primary schools. The favorable rat-
ing of the teacher-made instructional materials with high
scores 2.5 and above on 16 items out of the 18 items on
agreement by respondents indicated that it is necessary to lay
more emphasis on teacher-made instructional materials. This
is in agreement with Olaitan,S.O. and Akpan, A.E (2003),
who found already made materials such as audio and visual
and flash cards relevant in the process of teaching pre-pri-
mary and primary school children. In support of the findings,
Weikart (2000) also indicated that visual teaching aids, cards,
and pictures have been found relevant in enhancing teaching
and learning at the primary school level. The findings could
be attributed to the fact that children are usually attracted by
pictures, actions, and demonstrations. Besides, from the
observation made by the researchers, primary school-level
children are very good in imitating and using their teachers
as role models.
Concluding Remarks
The result, as indicated by the study, shows that the use of
teacher-made instructional materials was highly useful in
enhancing the learning-disabled children's performance in
the classroom as perceived by the children in this study.
There is the indication that there is no significant differ-
ence between male and female pupils taught using teacher-
made instructional materials. Therefore, the place of
teacher-made instructional materials in the process of
teaching and learning cannot be over emphasized. They
attract the attention of pupils and enable them to contribute
to discussions on the topics being taught, using the materi-
als to illustrate and in that process store the information
acquired in their long-term memory for further
application.
Recommendations
The following recommendations were made based on the
findings of the study:
1. Teacher-made instructional materials should be
included for teaching all the subjects in primary
schools to enable children to get information from
the primary source.
2. The curriculum planners should encourage teachers
to use teacher-made instructional materials by paying
specific allowance, basically, for this purpose.
3. Curriculum planners should make use of the findings
of this study to revisit and review the application of
teacher-made instructional materials for enhancing
teaching and learning.
