Banks' Regulatory Buffers, Liquidity Networks and Monetary Policy
Transmission*
July 2006
Christian Merkla and Stéphanie Stolzb
Abstract
Based on a quarterly regulatory dataset for German banks from 1999 to 2004,
this paper analyzes the effects of banks' regulatory capital on the transmission of
monetary policy in a system of liquidity networks. The dynamic panel regression
results provide evidence in favor of the bank capital channel theory. Banks
holding less regulatory capital and less interbank liquidity react more
restrictively to a monetary tightening than their peers.

Non-Technical Summary
The recent theoretical and empirical literature has been giving increasing
attention to the role played by banks in the transmission of monetary policy to
the real economy. Two possible channels have been discussed. The bank lending
channel theory argues that small banks with weak liquidity positions have to cut
their loan supply after a monetary tightening if the market for bank debt is
imperfect: Such banks face difficulties in substituting the decrease in deposits by
external non-insured funds. In contrast, the bank capital channel theory argues
that poorly capitalized banks that are subject to capital regulation may cut their
loan supply after a monetary tightening if the market for bank equity is imperfect:
Banks face maturity transformation costs (i.e. costs incurred after a monetary
tightening due to the inability to re-price long-term loans, whereas funding turns
more expensive immediately), which reduce their interest income and, hence, the
capital position. As a consequence, poorly capitalized banks may have to cut
lending, thus possibly generating real economic effects if bank customers do not
have perfect substitutes for bank loans.
This paper tests whether a bank capital channel type of transmission
mechanism exists in the German banking system. The intuition behind the
empirical model is the following: banks try to avoid the cost of falling below the
regulatory minimum capital requirements by holding capital buffers and asset
buffers, i.e. short-term risk-weighted assets (other than customer loans) that can
be liquidated if the bank runs into problems with the capital requirement. A
monetary tightening leads to costs for banks with a time-to-maturity mismatch
between assets and liabilities. Hence, if these banks additionally have low asset
and capital buffers, they are expected to react more restrictively, as for them, the
expected value of the costs of violating the capital regulation increases.
This paper then tests the derived hypotheses based on quarterly data for
German universal banks for the period 1999:03 to 2004:12. Our analysis shows
that, in the light of a restrictive monetary policy, the interaction of the asset and
capital buffer plays a significant role. Further, banks with a low asset buffer react
more restrictively after a monetary tightening than their peers if they face
maturity transformation costs. The capital buffer is only significant in interaction
with a low asset buffer. The interdependence is illustrated by the fact that the
asset buffer plays an important role only for banks with a low capital buffer.
All additional pieces of evidence point in the same direction. First, the more
pronounced the time-to-maturity mismatch of a bank, the more its income
interest position deteriorates. Second, other bank-specific variables that may
signal financial strength to market participants and that are often used in the
empirical literature to test for the bank lending channel are found to be
insignificant. Third, as the majority of German banks is organized in liquidity
networks, we also test whether another type of transmission mechanism may
come through the respective head institutions. However, we find no evidence to
support this hypothesis. All in all, we find clear evidence that a bank capital
channel exists in the German banking system.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Die theoretische und empirische Literatur hat in den letzten Jahren verstärkt die
Rolle von Banken in der geldpolitischen Transmission analysiert. Dabei werden
zwei mögliche Kanäle diskutiert. Die Theorie des Bankkreditkanals
argumentiert, dass kleine Banken mit geringer Liquidität bei einer Straffung der
Geldpolitik ihre Kreditvergabe einschränken müssen, falls der Markt für
Bankschulden unvollkommen ist. Solche Banken können nur schwer den
Rückgang der versicherten Einlagen durch die Ausgabe von
Schuldverschreibungen kompensieren. Im Gegensatz dazu argumentiert die
Theorie des Bankkapitalkanals, dass schlecht kapitalisierte Banken, die
Mindestkapitalanforderungen einhalten müssen, bei einer Straffung der
Geldpolitik ihre Kreditvergabe einschränken müssen, wenn der Markt für
Bankkapital unvollkommen ist. Banken entstehen durch steigende Zinszahlungen
auf ihre Verbindlichkeiten Kosten, die sie bei längerfristigen Festzinskrediten
nicht unmittelbar an ihre Kreditnehmer weitergeben können. Diese
Fristentransformationskosten reduzieren das Zinsergebnis und damit das
Eigenkapital von Banken. Schlecht kapitalisierte Banken müssen daher ihre
Kreditvergabe verringern, was bei fehlenden vollständigen Substituten für
Bankkredite einen negativen realwirtschaftlichen Effekt nach sich ziehen kann.
Das Papier testet die Existenz des Bankkapitalkanals in Deutschland. Das
empirische Modell nimmt an, dass Banken Kosten der Verletzung der
Mindestkapitalanforderungen vermeiden wollen, indem sie Kapitalpuffer und
Aktivpuffer (d.h. Aktiva, die bei einer Verschlechterung der Eigenkapitalposition
kurzfristig liquidiert werden können) halten. Eine Straffung der Geldpolitik führt
zu Fristentransformationskosten, auf die Banken mit niedrigem Kapital- und
Aktivpuffer mit einer Einschränkung ihrer Kreditvergabe reagieren müssen,
wenn sie eine Verletzung der Mindestkapitalanforderungen vermeiden wollen.
Das Papier testet diese Hypothesen basierend auf Quartalsdaten für deutsche
Universalbanken für den Zeitraum von 1999:03 bis 2004:12. Die Analyse zeigt,
dass die Interaktion von Aktiv- und Kapitalpuffer bei einer restriktiven
Geldpolitik eine wichtige Rolle spielt. Ferner reagieren Banken mit niedrigem
Aktivpuffer restriktiver auf eine Straffung der Geldpolitik und damit
einhergehende Fristentransformationskosten als andere Banken. Der
Kapitalpuffer ist nur in Interaktion mit dem Aktivpuffer signifikant. Die
Interdependenz wird dadurch verdeutlicht, dass der Aktivpuffer nur bei Banken
mit niedrigem Kapitalpuffer eine wichtige Rolle spielt.
Alle zusätzlichen Indizien weisen ebenfalls auf das Vorliegen eines
Bankkapitalkanals in Deutschland hin. Zum einen verschlechtert sich das
Zinsergebnis von Banken umso mehr, je stärker sie Fristentransformation
betreiben. Zum anderen erweisen sich andere bank-spezifische Variablen, die
Marktteilnehmern finanzielle Stärke einer Bank signalisieren und die daher in der
empirischen Literatur zum Testen des Bankkreditkanals herangezogen werden,
als insignifikant. Da die Mehrheit der deutschen Banken in
Liquiditätsnetzwerken organisiert ist, überprüfen wir auch, ob der
Bankkreditkanal eventuell über die jeweiligen Girozentralen wirken kann. Jedoch
können wir dafür keinerlei Indizien finden. Zusammenfassend lässt sich
feststellen, dass unsere Ergebnisse auf die Existenz eines Bankkapitalkanals in
Deutschland hinweisen.

1 Introduction
The issue of how monetary policy is transmitted to the real economy remains far
from being resolved, although some major theoretical and empirical progress has
been made recently.1 For a long time, most economists did not assign any active
role to banks in the transmission of monetary policy. The bank lending channel
theory has altered this view, predicting that real economic effects of a monetary
tightening are amplified by small banks with weak liquidity positions. When the
market for bank debt is imperfect, these banks have to cut their loan supply after
a monetary tightening. The empirical evidence for the United States indeed
shows this pattern (Kashyap and Stein, 2000). But the evidence is at best mixed
for Europe in general (Angeloni et al., 2003) and Germany in particular (Worms,
2003).
The difference in the way German and US banks react to changes in monetary
policy is related to the structure of the banking system. More than two thirds of
German banks are organized in liquidity networks. When the central bank
tightens monetary policy, large head institutions inject liquidity into the system,
thereby countervailing restrictive effects (Ehrmann and Worms, 2004).
Furthermore, a major part of German banks is owned by local authorities and all
their liabilities were guaranteed by the government until July 2005. Hence, they
faced, at most, lax refinancing constraints.
Recently, a new strand of the literature has given a prominent role to banks
and their regulatory capital buffers in monetary policy transmission, even under a
frictionless market for bank debt. The bank capital channel theory predicts that
banks that are subject to capital regulation may cut their loan supply after a
monetary tightening in an imperfect market for bank equity (Van den Heuvel,
2002b, 2003). So far, there is no microeconometric evidence on this issue for
Germany.2
Our paper tests for the existence of the bank capital channel, taking into
account the specific features of the German banking system. The idea is that
banks try to avoid the cost of falling below the regulatory minimum capital
requirements by holding capital buffers and asset buffers, i.e. short-term risk-
weighted assets (other than customer loans) that can be liquidated if the bank has
trouble complying with the capital requirement. A monetary tightening leads to

costs for banks, with a time-to-maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities.
Hence, if these banks additionally have low asset and capital buffers, they are
expected to react more restrictively, as for them, the expected value of the costs
of violating the capital regulation increases.
These hypotheses are tested using regulatory bank-level data on German
banks. We find evidence that a bank capital channel exists. Banks with a low
regulatory capital buffer and a low asset buffer react more restrictively after a
monetary tightening than the average bank. This phenomenon can be observed
for the whole sample as well as for savings banks and for credit cooperatives,
which are both organized in liquidity networks. We have no indication that a low
capital buffer of head institutions leads to a more restrictive behavior of the
respective liquidity network members.
With respect to the effect of macroeconomic variables on bank lending, we
find that a monetary tightening (GDP growth) has the expected negative
(positive) effect on bank lending. Interestingly, we detect an omitted variable
bias if we do not include a measure of interest rate volatility. Banks are found to
lend less in times of volatile interest rates. This is a novel finding for Germany.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the theoretical
literature on the bank capital channel and derives hypotheses. Section 3 presents
the empirical model and the methodology. Section 4 gives the empirical results,
and Section 5 concludes.
2 Related Literature and Theoretical Hypotheses
According to the bank lending channel theory, monetary policy affects the supply
of intermediated credit, particularly bank loans, and is active through an
imperfect market for bank debt. A restrictive monetary policy leads to a drop of
banks' reservable and typically insured deposits. Only banks that have a larger
share of liquid assets or that are bigger are able to shield their lending
relationships. The former can draw on their liquid assets, whereas the latter have
better access to external finance due to their size. Hence, they do not have to curb
their lending as sharply as their small or less liquid peers (see Bernanke and
Gertler, 1995). The same may be true for banks with a bigger capital-to-assets
ratio: Market participants may perceive highly capitalized banks as being less
risky (Kishan and Opiela, 2000). Consequently, it should be more expensive for
2
poorly capitalized banks to finance externally. If debtors do not have perfect
substitutes for loans, banks' restrictive lending behavior constitutes a cost to
them. As a consequence, the bank lending channel theory predicts a real
economic effect in addition to conventional channels, which would not exist
under a perfect market for debt.
Empirically, banks with a lower ratio of cash and securities (i.e. liquidity) to
total assets react more restrictively to a tightening of monetary policy in the
United States (Kashyap and Stein, 2000). The result is attributable to small banks
and thus provides evidence in favor of the bank lending channel theory.3 The
evidence for Europe is somewhat mixed and depends very much on the structure
of the national banking system.4 Worms (2003) concluded in an empirical study
for Germany that small banks with low liquidity do not necessarily react more
restrictively to a monetary policy tightening than their peers. However, banks
reduce lending more sharply the lower their ratio of short-term interbank
liquidity to total assets. A reaction along the lines of the traditional bank lending
channel based on the size criterion can only be found when controlling for the
influence of interbank liquidity. Ehrmann and Worms (2004) show in a related
paper that German savings banks and credit cooperatives use their head
institutions for liquidity management: The head institutions accept short-term
deposits from the local banks and provide longer-term loans in return. As a
consequence, criteria such as the size of a bank, which would lead to an
asymmetric reaction in a banking system without liquidity networks, are partially
undone in the German banking system.
In addition, local savings banks and credit cooperatives may not be subject to
significantly different costs of finance.5 As mentioned, most German banks use
their head institutions for liquidity management. Even without sufficient short-
term deposits at their head institutions, they can re-finance with similar
conditions at their head institutions and are thus not subject to a lemon's
premium incurred by market participants. This is amplified by the fact that local
savings banks and their head institutions enjoyed government guarantees until
July 2005 ("Gewährträgerhaftung").6 Besides, for the majority of credit
____________________

described pattern is much weaker and thus economically potentially not as relevant
when taking market volatility into account. For a theoretical explanation, see Baum
(2004b).
4 For a summary of the most recent results, see Angeloni et al. (2003).
5 Differences in the costs of finance depending on bank-specific criteria, however,
are necessary in the theoretical model developed by Ehrmann et al. (2003), which
was used for a number of empirical studies.
6 Their owners (cities, municipalities, rural districts for savings banks and states plus
the local savings banks for the head institutions) guaranteed all liabilities. Thus, in
the past, all institutes in the savings bank sector enjoyed the status of a de facto
3
cooperatives and savings banks, the amount of customer deposits is bigger than
the amount of overall loans. From 1999 to 2004, this was the case for about 80%
of the credit cooperatives and for about 60% of the savings banks in our sample.7
Thus, these banks have no need for external finance.
At first glance, the empirical finding by Worms (2003) that interbank liquidity
matters a lot in Germany seems to contradict our hypothesis. But the bank capital
channel theory recently developed by Van den Heuvel (2002b, 2003) sheds a bit
more light on this issue. The bank capital channel is active through an imperfect
market for bank equity. A restrictive monetary policy directly affects banks via
maturity transformation costs, since they typically have a maturity mismatch
between assets and liabilities.8 As a consequence, banks incur losses or make
smaller-than-expected profits, affecting their capital. Since it is costly (or almost
impossible for most German banks) to raise new equity, banks that are poorly
capitalized will have to cut lending to keep an adequate regulatory capital buffer
and to reduce the risk of violating the capital requirements.9 There are three
necessary conditions for the bank capital channel to be operative: an imperfect
market for bank equity, a maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities
exposing banks to interest rate risks, and the existence of minimum capital
requirements. All of these conditions are fulfilled in Germany. First of all, locally
organized banks are owned either by government institutions or by their
members. Hence, it is very difficult for them to raise new equity. But even
publicly listed companies are subject to financial frictions. Second, descriptive
statistics show that German banks perform maturity transformation (see
Appendix B). Finally, all German banks are subject to minimum capital
requirements.
Van den Heuvel (2002a) presents indirect evidence that the bank capital
channel exists in the United States. When a state's banking sector starts out with
a low capital-to-assets ratio, its subsequent output growth is more sensitive to
changes to the monetary policy indicator.
Without using regulatory data, it is not clear a priori whether a more
restrictive reaction of banks after a monetary tightening is driven by higher costs

7 Measured as time periods when banks had more customer deposits than customer
loans. Free savings banks are not included in this number, since they follow
different economic dynamics.
8 Loans typically have a longer time to maturity than deposits. Maturity
transformation is regarded as one of the main functions of a bank (see e.g. Freixas
and Rochet, 2004).
9 According to Basel I, 8% of the loan volume has to be held as capital (there are
exceptions for government and other specific loans). A violation of the minimum
capital requirement may have serious consequences, such as being taken under the
control of the domestic supervisors or even being closed down.

of finance or by the risk of violating the capital requirement. Hence, three studies
on European countries (Austria, Italy, and Switzerland) use regulatory data. They
do, in fact, find evidence supporting the bank capital channel, as banks with
lower regulatory capital buffers10 are found to react more restrictively to a
monetary tightening (Engler et al., 2005; Gambacorta and Mistrulli, 2004;
Bichsel and Perrez, 2005).11
There is no microeconometric study for Germany so far that uses regulatory
capital to analyze the transmission of monetary policy. This paper tries to fill the
gap.
3 The Empirical Model and Methods
In this section, we describe our empirical approach. First, we derive our
estimation equation and the hypothesis to be tested later in the paper. We
subsequently discuss the employed econometric methods.
3.1 Empirical Model
Van den Heuvel (2003) develops a dynamic model that shows that banks'
lending response to monetary policy depends on their capital structure. He
illustrates in a calibrated model that monetary policy can change the supply of
bank loans through its impact on bank equity. However, his model is not suited
to derive a reduced form for the reaction of banks to monetary policy depending
on their bank-specific criteria and of course does not take into account certain
special features of the German banking system, such as liquidity networks.
Hence, in order to test the bank capital channel, we extend the standard model
used in the empirical literature (see, for instance, Kashyap and Stein (2000);
____________________
10 Some other studies use "excess capital" synonymously for "capital buffer."

lending channel, since they cannot find any evidence that Austrian savings banks
and credit cooperatives perform significant maturity transformation.

for the cost a bank incurs when facing a one-percentage-point increase in the
monetary policy indicator. Hence, Rho*MP is a proxy for the maturity
transformation costs. i and t refer to the bank and time dimension, respectively. A

The intuition behind our specification is the following: Banks are
monopolistic competitors, who choose an optimal combination of loan interest
rate and loan supply, taking the expected costs of falling below the capital
requirement and of re-financing into account. Even if banks are not subject to
different costs of finance, as in the bank lending channel theory,13 monetary
policy can lead to an asymmetric reaction as predicted by the bank capital
channel literature. If a bank faces maturity transformation costs due to an
increase in the market interest rate, the risk of violating the capital requirement
increases, especially when it is short on its asset and capital buffer. The more
short-term risk-weighted assets (other than customer loans) the bank holds on its
balance sheet (i.e. the higher the bank's asset buffer), the lower the risk of
violating the capital requirements will be: The short-term risk-weighted assets

13 In the baseline regression we omit the bank lending channel option. In a robustness
check, we assume that the amount of inflowing deposits is driven by the stance of
monetary policy to incorporate the features of the bank lending channel into the
model. As a consequence, monetary policy can be transmitted via the head
institution of the liquidity network of banks.

will soon be liquid, thereby reducing the capital requirement in the near future.
Also, the higher the bank's capital buffer, the lower the risk of violating the
capital requirement will be. If the asset and capital buffer are not sufficiently
high, given maturity transformation costs the bank faces a higher risk of violating
the capital regulation after a monetary tightening. Thus, it may decide to cut its
loan supply by more than its peers in order to restore adequate capital and asset
buffers. Even if banks are not pure profit maximizers, they will weigh the risk of
violating the capital requirements against other objectives, such as relationship
banking.
The empirical specification is very similar in spirit to Worms (2003), who
uses an interaction between different bank-specific variables and the money
market rate to test for the bank lending channel. We deviate in two ways from his
specification. First of all, we use the capital buffer instead of the capital-to-
assets-ratio, since we consider the distance from the regulatory threshold as the
relevant criterion for the bank capital channel. Second, the bank-specific
variables are not interacted with the market interest rate, but with the proxy for
maturity transformation costs (Rho*MP), as low buffers will only affect a bank
according to the bank capital channel theory if it faces maturity transformation
costs.14 In Appendix A, it can be seen that almost all German banks have a
longer time-to-maturity of assets than liabilities, i.e. they have a positive Rho.
Thus, the bigger Rho, the more exposed is a bank to interest rate increases, and
the more pronounced should be its reaction in terms of loan volume reduction.
We consider the double interaction of the asset and capital buffer as very
important, since it captures the interaction between both variables, i.e. it
conditions one on the other. Intuitively, a bank should be very cautious if it is
low on both types of buffers, whereas having either a significantly high asset or
capital buffer may reduce the risk of violating the capital requirements
significantly.
As we do not know the right set of macro variables in advance and as there is
always the danger of not capturing the time effects properly and thus obtaining
seriously biased coefficients for the micro variables, we replace all macro
variables in the baseline regression with a set of time dummies. This comes with
a price tag: we do not know how the average bank will react to interest rate
changes and other macro variables. To overcome this problem, we experiment
later to find out which set of macro variables leads to similar estimated
coefficients for the micro variables.
To capture the dynamics fully, we add lags to explanatory variables.
Furthermore, we add the asset and capital buffer as level terms to keep our
estimated specification as general as possible and to prevent an omitted variables
bias.

Monetary Union period), whereas Worms uses the time span 1992-1998.

For expositional simplicity, we do not show the full (short-term) dynamics
when giving the regression results in Section 4 but instead confine ourselves to
showing the "long-term" coefficients. For instance, we calculate the "long-term"
coefficient  using the following formula:
4 4

/(1 )

j j
  
= =
= -
¦ ¦ .
The other "long-term" coefficients are calculated accordingly.
Taking as the null hypothesis that German banks do not react along the lines
of the bank capital channel, we can state our hypothesis in terms of the
coefficients  ,  , and  as follows:15
H1
:  >0, or  >0, or  <0
We expect banks with a lower capital buffer to react more restrictively if they
face maturity transformation costs ( >0) caused by a monetary tightening.
Similarly, we expect the same for banks with a lower asset buffer ( >0). Finally,
we expect that banks that are weak in both categories are at a disproportionately
high risk of running into trouble with the capital regulation. We therefore expect
them to react much more restrictively ( <0). For the capital channel to be at
work, at least one of these three estimated long-term coefficients has to show the
expected significant sign and none of the other coefficients may show an
unexpected significant sign. For the double interaction term (<0), it is important
to know whether it is driven by banks with low or high capital and asset buffers.
The latter would lead to the counterintuitive result that banks with high asset and
capital buffers react more restrictively to a monetary tightening than their peers.
This will be analyzed in a robustness check.
In the following analysis, we use two measures of banks' asset buffers. The
first measure contains short-term interbank assets with a maturity of up to one
year, whereas the second one additionally includes shares and securities
holdings. While short-term interbank assets are not subject to interest rate risk,
securities and shares may suffer significant losses if the interest rate increases.
These losses may prevent sales, which means that the first measure therefore
contains more highly liquid assets than the second measure.
Further, short-term interbank loans may serve a double function. Local banks
deposit short-term funds at their respective head institutions in the liquidity
network and obtain long-term loans in return (Ehrmann and Worms, 2004). Thus,
the more short term loans a bank holds at the interbank market, the less it is
exposed to maturity transformation costs. Hence, banks can use this instrument

negative values for banks with low buffers (see Appendix A for details).

as a hedging mechanism. This, in turn, also reduces the risk of violating the
capital requirements.
The question as to whether a potential differential reaction of banks to
monetary policy based on the first asset buffer (short-term interbank loans) is
driven more by the described asset buffer function or by its hedging
characteristics goes beyond the scope of this study. As a consequence, we stay
agnostic in what follows and call the first asset buffer interbank liquidity, thus
leaving this question to the critical reader and future research.
3.2 Econometric Approach
Given Eq. (1), we employ dynamic panel data techniques that control for the
bank-specific effects
i
µ . We take the first difference of the model specified in
Eq. (1) in order to eliminate the individual effect
i
µ , and we try to find suitable
instruments for the lagged endogenous variable. Arellano and Bond (1991)
suggest a generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator that uses the entire
set of lagged values of the endogenous variable as instruments. Arellano and
Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998) show that additional moment
conditions are valid if the autoregressive process is mean-stationary: then, first
differences of the endogenous variable are uncorrelated with the individual effect
i
µ and can thus be used as instruments for equations in levels. In order to obtain
the efficient GMM estimator, both sets of moment conditions have to be
combined to obtain the "system GMM estimator" proposed by Blundell and
Bond (1998). Given the potential endogeneity of the other bank-specific
variables, Capital Buffer and Asset Buffer, we also include GMM-style
instruments for these variables. We only use a sub-sample of the whole history of
the series as instruments in the later cross-section. To determine the optimal lag
length of the instruments, we use the Hansen test as the specification criterion
(Andrews and Lu, 2001).
As, for our sample, the one- and two-step Blundell-Bond system GMM
estimator produce quite similar estimates, we present only the (asymptotically)
more efficient two-step estimates. However, the two-step estimates of the
standard errors tend to be severely downward biased (Arellano and Bond, 1991;
Blundell and Bond, 1998). To compensate, we use the finite-sample correction to
the two-step covariance matrix derived by Windmeijer (2005).
Since the econometric literature has pointed out that GMM estimations may
deliver inconsistent results too (see e.g. Bound and Baker, 1993), Appendix C
additionally shows results from fixed effects regressions as a robustness check.
Alvarez and Arellano (2003) find that the GMM estimates are close to fixed
9
effect estimates for panels with a large time dimension.16 We therefore expect
the two methodologies to yield qualitatively similar results.
4 Empirical Results
Our dataset consists of bank-level confidential supervisory data on German
universal banks (commercial banks, savings banks with their central giro
institutions, and credit cooperatives with their central giro institutions) for the
time period 1999:03 to 2004:12 (following the establishment of the European
Monetary Union). The variable definition and the treatment of outliers and
mergers are described in full detail in Appendix A.
In the following subsections, we first present the results of estimating Eq. (1).
We then give additional evidence that the results are indeed in line with the
capital channel. Finally, we show that our results may also be economically
significant.
4.1 Asymmetrical Reactions to Monetary Policy
Baseline Regression
Table 1 shows the long-term coefficients obtained from estimating Eq. (1) and
the specification tests (Hansen test and the tests of serial correlation in the first-
differenced residuals). Since the results obtained from fixed effects are
qualitatively the same and differ only in magnitude (see Table A3 in
Appendix C), we confine ourselves to discussing the results obtained from the
Blundell-Bond procedure, unless we consider differences to be insightful.
First, in the baseline regression with time dummies, the estimated coefficient
for the interaction term of Interbank Liquidity and Maturity Transformation
____________________

i
µ .
However, it is still biased of O(1/T), and its consistency depends on T being large
(Nickell 1981). In our case, T is about 20 and, hence, larger than in most panel
datasets. We therefore opt to complement our GMM estimates with fixed effects
estimates.

Costs is found to be significant and positive, while the interaction term between
Capital Buffer and Maturity Transformation Costs is found to be insignificant.
This means that banks with below-average interbank liquidity react in a more
strongly negative way to a monetary tightening than their average peers, which
gives support to hypothesis H1
.
Second, the interaction term between Capital Buffer, Interbank Liquidity, and
Maturity Transformation Costs is found to be significant and negative. This
indicates that there is a meaningful interaction between the interbank liquidity
and the capital buffer. Banks with both a low capital buffer and low interbank
liquidity react more restrictively to an increase in the interest rate than their peers
which have, for instance, only a low interbank liquidity, thus giving support to
hypothesis H1
: The lower the capital buffer and the interbank liquidity, the higher
the risk they face of violating the capital requirements. As a consequence, banks
with a low capital buffer and low interbank liquidity act more restrictively than
their average peers when they face maturity transformation costs after a monetary
tightening.
The sign of the estimated coefficient of the interaction term of Capital Buffer,
Interbank Liquidity, and Maturity Transformation Costs may also indicate that
highly capitalized banks with an above-average asset buffer also react more
restrictively to an increase in the interest rate (due to the normalization). This last
effect would clearly be counterintuitive. Hence, in the following subsection, we
analyze whether the significant and negative sign of the coefficient is driven by
highly or poorly capitalized banks. To do so, we assign dummies according to
their average capitalization in the next section.

Notes: The table gives the long-term coefficients based on Blundell-Bond two-step estimations with
Windmeijer corrections of Eq. (1). The dependent variable is Loan Growth, measured as the quarterly
growth rate of domestic loans to non-financial firms and to private customers. Risk is defined as new loan
loss provisions plus loan write-offs divided by total loans. Capital Buffer is defined as regulatory capital
minus risk-weighted assets divided by total assets. Asset Buffer is defined as short-term interbank claims
divided by total assets. Rho is a proxy for the maturity transformation cost a bank faces after a one-
percentage-point increase in the monetary policy indicator. MP is defined as the absolute change in the
three-month EURIBOR (=monetary policy indicator). GDP Growth is defined as quarterly growth rate of
real GDP. For better readability of the table, the estimated coefficients for Rho* MP are rescaled by the
factor 10-2, Capital Buffer * Rho* MP and Interbank Liquidity * Rho * MP by 10-4 and Capital Buffer
* Interbank Liquidity * Rho* MP by 10-6. t-statistics are given in brackets. ***, **, and * indicate
statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively, in a two-tailed t-test. Hansen test
refers to the test of overidentifying restrictions. AR(1) and AR(2) test refer to the test for the null of no
first-order and second-order autocorrelation in the first-differenced residuals. For the Hansen, the AR(1),
and the AR(2) tests, p-values are shown.
12
If we use the quarterly changes of the Euribor and the real GDP growth rate
instead of the full set of time dummies, we obtain similar results for the
interaction term of Capital Buffer, Interbank Liquidity, and Maturity
Transformation Cost. But the significant coefficient for the interaction term of
Interbank Liquidity and Maturity Transformation Costs cannot be replicated. As
expected, lending depends positively on real GDP growth. The estimated
coefficient for interest rate changes is negative, but surprisingly not significant.
The described results and the rejection of the Hansen test (although the
autocorrelation tests of second and higher order show no problems) indicate that
the two macro variables are unable to capture the time effects entirely and/or we
have chosen an inappropriate set of instruments. This issue will be discussed in
more detail in the dummy approach in the next section.
If we use the second asset buffer measure (instead of interbank liquidity),
which also includes securities and shares, we find no evidence throughout the
entire sample that banks react asymmetrically with respect to this measure.
Interestingly, if we split the sample according to banking groups (not shown
here), for savings banks, the second asset buffer measure delivers estimation
results that are qualitatively similar to those for interbank liquidity. The
estimated coefficient for the interaction term of Capital Buffer, Asset Buffer 2,
and Maturity Transformation Costs is negative and significant at the 5% level.
The critical reader may wonder if this result is driven by the interbank liquidity,
which is also contained in this measure. But the correlation between the two asset
buffers is only 0.23 in the savings bank sector. Since we do not find similar
patterns in the subsample for credit cooperatives or the entire sample, we leave
this issue for future micro banking research and concentrate on the first asset
buffer (interbank liquidity) in what follows.
There are two possible explanations why the interbank liquidity performs far
better in the overall sample: First, shares and securities are subject to interest rate
risk and may thus not be sufficiently liquid to serve as an asset buffer. When
banks face maturity transformation costs after a monetary tightening, these
assets' value may deteriorate. Alternatively, the additional hedging function of
interbank liquidity, as described in Section 3, might render them more important.
The estimated coefficient for Maturity Transformation Costs is insignificant
in Specifications (1) and (2), indicating that banks do not react to maturity
transformation costs as such, but only in interaction with the asset and capital
buffer. This result is in line with our theoretical setting. Although maturity
transformation costs reduce the current profit of a bank, they are sunk costs.
Their current magnitude is determined by the term structure of assets and
liabilities one period before, which cannot be affected by the contemporary loan
policy. Thus, banks only react more restrictively to maturity transformation costs
if they belong to the group of poorly capitalized and low liquidized banks.
The baseline regression furthermore shows that, higher Risk leads to a
significant decrease in loan growth: As increasing credit risk increases the need
13
to build up capital buffers, banks with a more risky loan portfolio have a slower
loan growth.
Neither the capital buffer nor the interbank liquidity shows a significant
influence on the average loan growth in our sample. Interestingly, the fixed effect
regressions indicate that banks with a bigger asset or capital buffer have a faster
loan growth.
Dummies
In order to see whether the significant negative coefficient of the interaction term
of Capital Buffer, Interbank Liquidity, and Maturity Transformation Costs we
have detected is driven by banks with high or low capital buffers, we define
dummy variables that capture the capitalization of banks. We assign one dummy
to banks that are, on average, below the 50th percentile of excess capitalization
(Low) and one dummy to those banks above this threshold (High).17 Each
dummy is multiplied by the interaction term of interbank liquidity and maturity
transformation costs. This allows us to disentangle the effects in the full
specification and to assign them to poorly and well capitalized banks. We are
aware that the threshold is arbitrary and therefore check to see whether the results
depend on the chosen threshold.18

Table 2 shows the regression results for Eq. (2). Like the baseline regression,
higher Risk is found to lead to a significant decrease in loan growth. Further, the
interaction term between Interbank Liquidity and Maturity Transformation Costs
corresponds to the interaction term between Capital Buffer, Interbank Liquidity,
and Maturity Transformation Costs in the baseline specification shown in
____________________
17 Without previously normalizing excess capital to zero, the sample split for credit
cooperatives and savings banks delivers similar results.
18 To check for robustness, we validated all results obtained from the dummy
approach by using an equivalent sample split for poorly and highly capitalized
banks, which is somewhat less restrictive with respect to the imposed dynamics
(for instance, not assigning the same estimated coefficients for the lagged
dependent variable for both types of banks). Since this approach leads to the same
conclusions, we do not show the estimated coefficients.
14
Table 1. The regression results show that the interaction term between Interbank
Liquidity and Maturity Transformation Costs is significant and positive only for
poorly capitalized banks and insignificant for well capitalized banks. Hence,
poorly capitalized banks react more restrictively to an increase in maturity
transformation costs if they have below-average interbank liquidity.
However, the reaction of highly capitalized banks to a change in the interest
rate does not depend on interbank liquidity. Again, these findings support the
hypothesis that the asset buffer plays an important role in interaction with the
capital buffer, namely for poorly capitalized banks.
As a robustness check, we run the same exercise and assign one dummy to the
lowest capitalized 25% of banks, one to banks capitalized within the 25% to 75%
range, and a third to the highest capitalized 25% of banks. The estimated
coefficient for the lowest capitalized banks is positive and significant at the 5%
level, while banks in the middle range show a positive, albeit insignificant sign,
and the best capitalized banks a negative and insignificant sign. This confirms
that the asymmetry is driven by the lowest capitalized banks in interaction with
their interbank liquidity.
If we replace the time dummy specification with a set of macro variables, the
quarterly changes in the Euribor and the real growth rate of GDP, we obtain the
same qualitative results for the interaction terms, thus confirming the
aforementioned hypotheses. As expected, the reaction to real GDP growth is
highly significant and positive, thus capturing loan demand effects. As in the
baseline specification, the estimated long-run coefficient for interest rate changes
is insignificant.
However, the implausible insignificance of MP disappears if we include a
volatility measure for the monetary policy indicator (calculated based on daily
data; see Appendix A for details) into the regression, as suggested by Baum
(2004a, b). As a consequence, the estimated coefficient for MP gains
significance and increases in magnitude. The latter also holds for the estimated
GDP coefficient. The volatility measure itself is found to be highly significant
and negative, indicating that higher interest rate volatility results in lower lending
activity on average. The big changes in the estimated coefficients for the other
two macroeconomic variables show that Specification (2), which only includes
real GDP growth and interest rate changes instead of the full set of time
dummies, suffers from a severe omitted variable bias.
Baum et al. (2004b) argue that banks behave more homogenously during
times of greater macroeconomic uncertainty, since macroeconomic volatility
prevents them from foreseeing investment opportunities. The inclusion of
macroeconomic volatility by Baum et al. (2004a) weakens the results in favor of
the bank lending channel, which was assembled by Kashyap and Stein (2000) for
the United States.

Unlike in Baum (2004a), the finding that banks react asymmetrically to
interest rate changes (expressed by the interaction terms of Interbank Liquidity
and Maturity Transformation Costs) remains unaffected by the inclusion of the
volatility measure. The estimated coefficient for the interaction term remains
similar, whereas the magnitude and significance level even increase somewhat in
the Blundell-Bond estimation. Furthermore, the estimated coefficient for the
interaction term of Volatility and Interbank Liquidity is insignificant.
Thus, interestingly, German banks do not seem to be affected by Baum's
critique that the result of an asymmetric reaction of banks to monetary policy is
weakened or even undone by including second moments. We hypothesize that
his point may be more relevant to the bank lending channel than to the bank
capital channel. We would tend to expect poorly capitalized banks to act more
cautiously if they cannot foresee investment opportunities properly.
All in all, the dummy approach underlines the hypothesis that banks with a
low capital buffer and a low interbank liquidity react more restrictively to
monetary policy than the average bank.
4.2 Further Evidence
In this subsection, we present several pieces of evidence that lend additional
support to our finding in favor of the bank capital channel. First, we analyze
whether maturity transformation costs, as defined by our proxy (see
Appendix A), are able to influence the interest income of banks significantly.
This is an important precondition for the bank capital channel to be active.
Second, we check to see if the asymmetric reaction is driven by a bank lending
channel-type mechanism. Therefore, we check (i) to see if banks react differently
depending on the customer deposits relative to customer loans on their balance
sheet and (ii) if savings banks, which are organized in liquidity networks, react
asymmetrically depending on the bank-specific criteria of their respective head
institution.
Interest Income
The bank capital channel theory argues that a monetary tightening reduces bank
profits, as banks face maturity transformation costs. Thus, poorly capitalized
banks have to reduce lending, as they see their capital position deteriorating even
further or are not able to reestablish a sustainable capital buffer. Hence, a
necessary precondition for the bank capital channel to be at work is deteriorating
profits after a monetary tightening. We test this precondition by regressing
banks' interest income on their maturity transformation costs. As interest income
17
is available only on a yearly basis, we use a yearly dataset in this subsection (see
Table 3 for results).
Specification 1 shows that maturity transformation costs have a highly
significant effect on interest income. As we do not include control variables other
than time dummies, it is particularly important to rule out autocorrelation in the
error term. However, if we allow for an AR(1) process in the error term
(Specification 2) or include lagged interest income in the fixed effects estimation
(Specification 3) or Blundell-Bond estimation (not shown here), the result is
qualitatively unaffected.
In sum, banks are found to face maturity transformation costs after a
monetary tightening that reduces their interest income. The existence of this
precondition for the bank capital channel to be at work strongly supports our
argument that the detected decline in bank lending by poorly capitalized banks
after a monetary tightening is indeed due to the bank capital channel.

Network Effects for Savings Banks?
There is an alternative possible way of transmission. It is possible that the
members of a liquidity network will restrict lending after a monetary tightening if
their respective head institution begins to have trouble providing sufficient
liquidity. To test this hypothesis, we have to match the banks with their
respective head institution and analyze whether member banks react differently
depending on the head institutions' bank-specific criteria. However, for credit
cooperatives, such an assignment does not exist, as they can re-finance at both of
their head institutions. In contrast, for savings banks, there is a strict regional
system for assigning local savings banks to their head institutions. We therefore
analyze this hypothesis for savings banks only.
Since the head institutions of savings banks were subject to
Gewährträgerhaftung (publicly underwritten liability) during our sample period,
they were considered as AAA-rated banks and should not have run into trouble to
acquire sufficient sources of finance. However, they could have reacted more
restrictively because of the expected cost of violating the capital rules. Thus, in
addition to the standard specification above, we interact the monetary policy
indicator with the excess capital position of the respective head institution:

The estimated long-run coefficient of the interaction between excess capital
and monetary policy indicator is found to be insignificant. As a consequence, we
conclude that there are no signs that local savings banks were credit constrained
by their head institutions.19
Bank Lending Channel
The critical reader may wonder whether the differences in the banks' reaction
with respect to their excess capitalization and interbank liquidity were driven by

term was highly significant. This may be an indication that the bank-specific
variables of the head institutions have an effect on the members of the respective
network.
19
the bank lending channel rather than the bank capital channel. The reasoning
could go as follows: highly capitalized banks may find cheaper sources of
unsecured finance than their poorly capitalized peers since market participants
perceive them as less risky. Furthermore, interbank liquidity may be used to
shelter customer loans when deposits are withdrawn.
Yet, the theoretical literature has  so far  failed to provide a consistent
framework to test the bank capital channel against the bank lending channel. In
their empirical paper, Gambacorta and Mistrulli (2004) argue that the capital
buffer captures the bank lending channel, while the maturity transformation costs
capture the bank capital channel. This line of argument is not fully convincing, as
the bank capital channel works through the interaction of maturity transformation
costs and capital. However, as the variables used to test the two channels are
either identical or at least highly correlated, an empirical approach that separates
the two channels is hard to come by. We are still convinced that our results are
driven by the bank capital channel due to the following reasons.
First, as mentioned in Section 2, a large percentage of German savings banks
and credit cooperatives have a much larger amount of customer deposits than
loans. For those banks, the traditional bank lending channel may not be strongly
operative since a drop in deposits after a monetary tightening would not
automatically force them to seek external sources of finance.20 If we restrict our
sample to periods where banks have more deposits than loans on the balance
sheet, we can find the same asymmetric pattern as for the entire sample. This
gives us a further indication that the asymmetric reaction is driven by the bank
capital channel.
Second, other bank-specific criteria that are usually used to test for the bank
lending channel are less significant, or not significant at all. Interestingly, if we
specify the model without maturity transformation costs, we obtain a
qualitatively similar pattern as before (results are not shown here, but are
available on request). However, if we specify our baseline equation with cash to
overall assets instead of interbank liquidity and the capital-to-assets ratio instead
of the excess capital, none of the estimated coefficients for the interaction terms
is significant at conventional levels. Further, if we define a Liquidity variable that
includes all assets with a maturity shorter than one year and securities (unlike the
second asset buffer, this measure also includes other positions such as cash), and
interact it with Excess Capital, we cannot obtain a significant estimated
coefficient. These findings do not necessarily mean that the bank lending channel
does not exist. Yet, they lend further support to our hypothesis that the bank
capital channel is at work.
____________________
20 Yet, although banks with more deposits than loans can, in principle, shelter their
customer loan supply after a monetary tightening, they may want to protect their
other investments due to portfolio considerations and, hence, may cut lending.
20
Summary
The additional evidence provided in this subsection gives support to the
hypothesis that the asymmetric reaction that we observe is indeed due to the bank
capital channel, although we do not rule out the possibility that the bank lending
channel may exist in parallel and thus strengthen the observed pattern.
Furthermore, there appears to be no indirect transmission via poor capitalization
of the head institutions in the savings bank sector.
4.3 Should We Care?
Ashcraft (2006) asks the question: "Bank loans might be special, but should
macroeconomists care?" Microeconometric evidence can only provide a first
indication of whether the bank capital channel can possibly affect the macro
economy. This is only the case if loan supply movements are large enough to
influence business cycle fluctuations.
Therefore, we analyze the size of poorly capitalized banks.21 In terms of loan
volume (assets), they are, on average, about 2.5 (3) times bigger than their well-
capitalized peers (see Appendix B). Thus, in contrast to many studies for the
bank lending channel,22 the asymmetric reaction of banks is not only driven by
very small banks, which are potentially irrelevant to the macro economy.
The regression results indicate that banks with a weak interbank liquidity
position and a high exposure to maturity transformation costs, behave most
restrictively. For simplicity, we assume that the 50 percent of banks with the
lowest interbank-liquidity buffer and with the largest exposure to maturity
transformation costs are well represented by the 25th percentile within this
subsample. Using the estimated coefficients, these banks would react by an
average of around 0.2 percentage point more restrictively than the average bank
if we take the most conservative GMM estimation and about 0.1 percentage point
if we use the fixed effects results.23
After a monetary contraction, following our regression results, we would
expect those banks that have the most negative values in the interaction of de-
meaned interbank liquidity and the most pronounced maturity mismatch between
the time-to-maturities of their assets and liabilities to react most restrictively.
Considering these banks in the sub-sample reveals that they are somewhat
smaller in terms of loan volume than the average bank in the sample.
____________________
21 Using the same definition as in the dummy approach.
22 See e.g. Frühwirth-Schnatter and Kaufmann (2006) for Austria.
23 If we use a pooled regression, we obtain estimated coefficients that are in between
the two other coefficients.
21
Without wanting to stretch our example too far, we present a back-of-the-
envelope calculation that illustrates the relevance of the bank capital channel. In
2004, the overall loan volume to companies and private clients was about  2.2
trillion in Germany. We assume for simplicity that, of the lower 50 percent
capitalized banks, half the banks with the smallest interbank liquidity and
greatest exposure to maturity transformation costs represents roughly about a
quarter of the lending volume. Furthermore, we take the results from the most
conservative estimation, saying that those banks reduce their lending by an
additional 0.1 percentage point in the long run (compared to their average peers)
if the interest rate goes up by 1 percentage point. Our back-of-the-envelope
calculation indicates that those banks would reduce their loan supply by  600
million in the long run.
Even if banks' customers can replace loans from their "house bank" with
other sources of finance, they may have to bear considerable switching costs. The
numbers therefore suggest that the bank capital channel may have significant
effects in Germany, especially if the loan supply exerts a multiplier effect on real
economic activity. A more detailed analysis would go beyond the scope of this
study and will be left for future research. To do so, it would be necessary to
analyze the reaction of bank customers to such a pattern, i.e. the substitutability
of loans.
5 Concluding Remarks
This paper provides evidence that the bank capital channel hypothesis is relevant
to Germany. The outlined theoretical framework adds an asset buffer to the
existing theory and shows its relevance in the empirical regressions. Banks with
lower asset and lower capital buffers that face maturity transformation costs react
more restrictively to a monetary tightening than their average peers.
We find evidence in favor of a meaningful interaction of interbank liquidity,
capital buffer and maturity transformation costs for the entire sample as well as
for the sub-samples for savings banks and credit cooperatives. Interestingly, the
second asset buffer measure, which additionally contains securities and shares,
performs far worse than interbank liquidity. There is only some weak evidence
for its relevance in the savings bank sector. The underlying reason for this pattern
may be an interesting question for future banking research.
22
The results indicate the existence of the bank capital channel. Although the
bank lending channel may exist in parallel, we are confident that our findings are
driven by the bank capital channel. However, as no framework to discriminate
the two channels exists, we cannot test the two channels against one another
more rigorously. Hence, future research on developing such an analytical
framework would be highly desirable.
In terms of affected lending volume, the results seem economically significant
and indicate that the bank capital channel may be an important source of
monetary policy transmission for Germany. However, the question as to the size
of the effects can only be answered with more evidence about the substitutability
of bank loans that are affected by potential reductions in the loan supply after a
monetary tightening. Furthermore, calibrated dynamic stochastic equilibrium
models of the Bernanke et al. (1999) type, which could try to incorporate the
bank capital channel explicitly, may deliver further insights into potential effects.
Both issues are surely a major challenge for future research.

Appendix A
The Dataset
The Raw Dataset
Our raw dataset consists of bank-level confidential supervisory data on German
universal banks (commercial banks, savings banks with their central giro
institutions, and credit cooperatives with their central giro institutions) for the
1999:03 to 2004:12 period.24 While the balance-sheet data is available on a
monthly basis, the data on loan-loss provisions and time-to-maturity of interest-
bearing assets is only available on an annual basis.
In line with the literature (e.g. Worms, 2003), we use a quarterly frequency in
order to capture the dynamic structure properly. For the balance-sheet data, we
use every third observation in time, while for the data on loan-loss provisions, we
distribute the provisions over the four quarters of a year, though not uniformly:
we interpolate between every two subsequent years in order to avoid jump
discontinuities at the end of each year.25
The Variables
The variable definitions are given in Table A1. Our two variables of interest,
Capital Buffer and Asset Buffer, are described in more detail in the following.
The Capital Buffer is defined as follows:
( )
( ) / ( )
( )
it it
i BG
it
it
it t
EC BG A BG
EC
Capital Buffer
A N BG
= -
¦
,
where excess capital (
it
EC ) is actual regulatory capital minus minimum
regulatory capital, A is total assets, and N is the number of banks. Hence, our
capital buffer variable is scaled by total assets and demeaned by the period's
mean of excess capital.26 We do not use the overall period's mean, but the mean
____________________
24 In contrast to subsidiaries of foreign banks, we do not include branches of foreign
banks, as their business activities in Germany are more likely to be driven by their
headquarters than by euro-zone monetary policy or total economic activity in
Germany. Further, their loan growth series often start from a very low level,
therefore show very high growth rates and are extremely volatile. As a
consequence, the inclusion of branches of foreign banks would bias the loan
growth rates strongly upwards.
25 The variable is divided by four before interpolating. To prevent an endogeneity
bias, we start instrumenting loan-loss provisions with the fourth lag.
26 We demean the data by the period's mean in order to remove the time trend that is
existent in the data. For descriptive statistics, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2005).

of the respective banking pillar27 (BG), since the pillars differ greatly with regard
to capitalization due to the pillars' institutional rules (see e.g. Koetter et al.,
2004).
Asset Buffer is defined as follows
( )

/
( )
it it
T
i BG
it

j

B BG A BG
B
Asset Buffer T

where
it
B are assets (other than loans) that have a non-zero regulatory risk
weight and a short time-to-maturity or that can be easily liquidized, A is total
assets, N is the number of banks, and T is the number of observations over time.
Hence again, we scale our measure by total assets and normalize it by the mean
of the respective banking group. In this case, however, we do not use the period's
mean but the overall mean since there is no time trend visible in the data.
We use two different subcategories of assets to construct B and, hence, Asset
Buffer. First, we use short-term interbank market liquidity, which consists of
interbank market assets with a time-to-maturity of less than one year.28 These
positions are subject to capital requirements, although only weighted with 20%,
and will expire within one year. Thus, they would reduce the required capital and
can serve as a buffer. This is our baseline measure, as it accounts for the existing
liquidity networks in Germany. As a robustness check, we use an alternative
measure that also includes shares and bonds. These two additional positions are
also subject to capital requirements and can easily be liquidized. The major
shortcoming is that they are subject to interest rate risk. Liquidizing them after an
increase in the market interest rate may result in a loss.
For the calculation of market volatility, we use a procedure similar to that of
Baum et al. (2004a). We extract the intra-quarterly volatility from daily data on
interbank market interest rates, government bond yields, and interest rate spreads.
The daily contribution to quarterly volatility is defined as:

where D

 are daily interest rate changes.29 They are normalized by the number
of days between two observations ( T
 ). If there is, for instance, a weekend
between two trading days,
t
 rises to three.
The intra-quarterly volatility is defined as

27 We distinguish three pillars: savings banks, credit cooperatives and commercial
banks.
28 This is the same measure used by Worms (2003) in a somewhat different context.
29 We obtained the following daily data from Datastream: the three-month money
market interest rate and the one-year, two-year, five-year and ten-year government
bond yields. In addition, we calculated several term spreads thereof.

The different measures interest rates, yields and spreads we used showed
similar results. For simplicity, we only show the results for the three-month
EURIBOR volatility in the main part.
Risk is defined as new loan loss provisions and loan write-offs divided by
total assets. By contrast, the empirical literature normally uses non-performing
loans as a risk proxy. However, data on non-performing loans is not available for
German banks. As new loan-loss provisions and loan write-offs are only
available on a yearly basis, we interpolate the data linearly to obtain quarterly
data, as we do with our measure of Rho.
Rho is a proxy for the cost a bank faces after a monetary tightening by the
central bank due to the maturity transformation and is calculated as follows:
j
A and
j
P are assets and liabilities classes with different time-to-maturity.
The Deutsche Bundesbank's prudential database contains six maturity classes.30
The sensitivities (
j
 and
j
 ) are obtained directly from the supervisory
regulations.31 We divided by the average size of interest-bearing assets and
liabilities to normalize for the size of a bank.
In order to determine the existence of a bank capital channel, it is necessary to
consider the change in a bank's profits due to a change in the interest rate. We
therefore need to take into account all interest-bearing assets and liabilities rather
than those merely existing in the trading portfolio. The extent to which a bank is
exposed to interest rate changes is dependent on the degree of maturity mismatch
held by the bank.
Since the regulatory data (maturity classes and risk) is only available on a
yearly basis, we interpolated it linearly to obtain quarterly data.
A positive Rho indicates maturity transformation costs. As can be seen in the
chart below, these costs are faced by most German banks.

Treatment of Mergers
During the observation period, the banking system underwent a strong
consolidation wave. For our analysis, it is important to identify these mergers, as
otherwise there would be unexplained jumps in the loan growth series, which
could lead to seriously biased results.
There are several alternative ways of treating mergers. First, banks involved
in mergers can be completely discarded from the sample. However, as there were
several hundred mergers during the observation period, especially between local
savings banks and between cooperative banks, this would lead to a significant
loss of information. The second option is to merge banks backwards. This
procedure hinges on two assumptions. First, banks are assumed to behave as one
entity, even pre-merger. And second, their behavior does supposedly not change
post-merger. As these assumptions seem to be pretty severe to us, we choose the
third option, i.e. to create a new notional institute after two banks merge. This
causes the number of banks to increase, because there is one additional bank for
each merger (the merging banks stay in the sample until the time of the merger,
and the newly created bank after the merger). The drawback of this procedure is
that we lose information, since all banks with six or less observations drop out of
the regressions.32 If we delete all banks with less than seven observations, the
sample shrinks by between 0.5 and 15% in terms of the banking sector's total
loans.33
Treatment of Outliers
In a panel framework it is crucial to identify outliers, as all banks --
independently of their size -- are weighted in the same way. If the sample is not
cleaned, there is the danger of results being driven by extreme outliers. Deleting
single outliers from the dataset would be extremely arbitrary. We therefore elect
to drop the whole time series for a bank if some observations for this bank
exceed a certain threshold. As thresholds we rely on percentiles, which we set
according to visual inspection of the histogram for the respective variable. If we
run robustness checks for different banking groups (not shown, but sometimes
referred to in this paper), we apply this outlier identification procedure to the
different banking groups separately. As this outlier identification procedure is
____________________
32 Differentiation of the dependent variable leads to a loss of one time period.
Furthermore, four lags of the dependent variable are used as regressors. In addition,
at least one more lag is needed for the instrumentation.
33 The loss of information is not entirely due to the treatment of mergers, as there
have also been banks with less than seven periods. The attrition is of course the
biggest at the borders of the sample and the smallest in the middle of the sample.
When we cut a bank e.g. in the first quarter of 2000 into two parts, the first five
quarters drop out of the sample (at least seven time-series observations are needed
to be included into the regression), whereas the later part remains.
31
also somewhat arbitrary, we run robustness checks to see if the results depend on
the chosen thresholds. However, they deliver the same qualitative results.
We use the following threshold for the standard specification, which we run
for savings banks and credit cooperatives. For the dependent variable Loan
Growth, we use the 1st and 99th percentile. For Asset Buffer, we use the 99th
percentile only, as the variable is non-negative by construction. For Capital
Buffer, we drop banks with negative observations: these banks may undergo
transitional adjustments in accordance with the supervisory authority.
Alternatively, they may be distressed and therefore under supervisory control. In
this case, they could not take deliberate investment and funding decisions.
However, we lack the data to discriminate between these two cases and, thus,
drop the negative observations. In addition, we use the 99th percentile. As a
result of this cleaning procedure, our remaining dataset covers about two thirds
of the banking sector in terms of the lending volume.34
If we run regressions for the entire sample, we widen the cut-off values to the
2nd and 98th percentile for loan growth and to the 98th centile for the other
variables. We effectively obtain a wider span of values, since they are much
more dispersed for commercial banks.35
The following two graphs (the left graph shows loan growth for the entire
sample before cleaning, the right one after cleaning) exemplarily show the
necessity of a data cleaning procedure, illustrating that the uncleaned dataset
would deliver seriously biased results.

____________________
34 When referring to results for the savings banks sector, we use only three lags of the
explanatory variables, since this was sufficient to capture the dynamics.
35 We do not run any outlier procedure for Rho since the visual inspection revealed
much fewer outliers. A robustness check showed that omitting the 1% and 99%
centiles of Rho leads to similar estimation results.

Notes: The table gives the long-term coefficients based on robust fixed effects estimations of Eq. (2).
Volatility is measured as intra-quarterly volatility of the three-month EURIBOR based on daily data. For
the other variable definitions, see Table 1. For better readability, the estimated coefficients for Rho*MP
are rescaled by the factor 10-2, Capital Buffer*Rho* MP and Interbank Liquidity*Rho*MP by 10-4,
Capital Buffer*Interbank Liquidity*Rho*MP by 10-6, Volatility by 104, and Interbank
Liquidity*Volatility by 102. t-statistics are given in brackets. For savings banks, we use only three lags of
the endogenous variables, since this is sufficient to capture the dynamics. ***, **, and * indicate
statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively, in a two-tailed t-test.
