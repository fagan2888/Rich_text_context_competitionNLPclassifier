in folate status in the US?

Background The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of the 1998
US Food and Drug Administration folic acid fortification policy on
disparities in folate status in the United States.
Methods We use repeated cross-sectional data from the U.S. National Health
and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), a nationally repre-
sentative sample of over 14 000 participants ages 25 and older.
We calculate pre-fortification (1991­94) and post-fortification
(1999­2002) absolute differences and relative prevalence ratios of
low red blood cell (RBC) folate status (<362.6 nmol), by race/
ethnicity and income quartile. We also estimate kernel density plots
and relative and absolute concentration curves pre- and post-
fortification.
Results The excess prevalence of low RBC folate status associated with
the lowest income quartile and black race declined by 67% and 48%,
respectively, following fortification. Despite these absolute gains, the
relative ratio of low folate status increased after fortification for the
lowest compared with the highest income groups (from 1.27 to 2.08)
and among whites compared with blacks (from 1.64 to 3.75).
Conclusions The effects of the fortification policy highlight the importance of
distinguishing absolute from relative differences when evaluat-
ing interventions to reduce health disparities. Targeting of high
risk populations is likely needed to eliminate remaining folate
disparities.

Introduction
Differences in health status by socioeconomic status
(SES), whether measured by mortality, chronic disease
or self-reported health, are consistently observed in
the United States.1 The U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services declared as one of the two major goals
of the Healthy People 2010 initiative `to eliminate health
disparities among different segments of the popula-
tion'.2 Unfortunately, knowledge regarding the effec-
tiveness of policy interventions that might reduce these
health disparities is lacking. The Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) first authorized folic acid for-
tification of all enriched cereal-grain products in the US
in March 1996 with the primary purpose of decreasing
the number of pregnancies affected by neural tube
defects, and the policy became mandatory by January
1998.3 This article examines racial/ethnic and income
disparities in folate status in the US before and after
enactment of mandatory fortification.

In addition to neural tube defects, low folate status
has been suggested as a risk factor for some types of
cancer.4 Low folate also contributes to higher concen-
trations of homocysteine, an amino acid that has been
implicated in ischaemic heart disease, stroke, physical
functioning, hip fractures and dementia.5­10 A recent
randomized, double-blind study found that 3 years
of folic acid supplementation improved cognitive func-
tion in a sample of 50- to 70-year-olds with raised
plasma homocysteine levels.11 The causality of the
association between homocysteine and cardiovascular
disease, as well as the efficacy of folic acid in preventing
cardiovascular disease, is still a matter of on-going
debate.9,12­14 Given the potential connections between
folate and chronic illnesses, the folic acid fortification
policy of the FDA provides a unique opportunity to
evaluate how a population-level, non-targeted inter-
vention influences the distribution of risk factors that
may contribute to health disparities.
Several studies have documented group differences
in folate status in the US prior to fortification. For
example, non-Hispanic whites were found to have
significantly higher levels of serum and red blood cell
(RBC) folate compared with non-Hispanic blacks for
the period 1988­91, with only weak associations found
between education and serum and RBC folate.15 Addi-
tional work has documented an increase in the levels of
serum folate and RBC folate concentrations, since the
implementation of the FDA folic acid fortification policy
across race/ethnic and socioeconomic groups in the
US.16­19 Overall, mean RBC folate concentrations were
57% higher in 1999­2000 compared with 1988­94, and
mean folate intake increased 28%.19 The prevalence of
low RBC folate (<362.2 nmol/l) fell from 45.8% to 7.3%
over this time period.17 While these studies described
general trends by certain subgroups, to our knowledge
no study has explicitly examined the magnitude of
relative and absolute disparities in folate status by
income and race/ethnicity before and after fortification.
Given the large reduction in the prevalence of low
folate status for all groups following fortification, we
expected that paying attention to changes in both
absolute and relative differences across groups would
be important in evaluating the impact of fortification on
disparities in low RBC folate status. In this study, we
examined both the absolute and relative prevalence
ratios of low RBC folate status by race/ethnicity and
income quartile before and after implementation of the
FDA's national fortification policy. As other countries
continue to debate mandatory fortification,20,21 this
analysis can shed light on the ability of such a far-
reaching policy to reach the highest risk groups in a
population.
Methods
Study population
Data for this study come from three waves of
the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Surveys (NHANES), which were conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention to assess the
health, dietary practices and nutritional status of the
civilian, non-institutionalized population of the US
2 months and older. Details on the survey design and
sampling methods of the NHANES III and NHANES
1999­2000 and 2001­02 surveys have been published
elsewhere.22,23 The NHANES III survey was con-
ducted in two phases, each individually designed to
be nationally representative. We use data from the
second phase of NHANES III, covering the years
1991­94, to represent the period prior to fortification.
Folic acid fortification was mandated by the FDA in
March 1996, requiring full implementation by January
1998.24 We use NHANES surveys from 1999­2000 and
2001­02 to represent the period post-fortification.
We do not use data from the first phase of NHANES III,
1988­91 in order to focus on the before and after
periods that are closest in time to implementation of the
fortification policy. Using temporally proximate periods
is likely to reduce error associated with varying trends
in diet, supplement use or health behaviours.
Physical examinations for the NHANES surveys are
conducted in Mobile Exam Centers (MEC), at which
time blood samples are obtained by venipuncture. We
limit our sample to adults aged 25 and older in order to
reduce the measurement error associated with income
in early adulthood. Of the 8699 individuals participat-
ing in the physical examination in NHANES III, 357
(4%) are missing values for RBC folate. Those missing
were more likely to be non-Hispanic Black or Mexican-
American, but do not significantly differ by age, income
or sex. Of the remaining 8342 respondents, 671 (8%)
were missing data for income. Those missing income
data did not significantly differ in RBC folate status.
In the combined 1999­02 data, 8252 individuals parti-
cipated in the exam. Of this group, 262 (3%) were
missing data on RBC folate. Of the remaining 7990
respondents, 804 (10%) were missing data on income,
but those missing did not differ significantly in RBC
folate status. Our final samples consists of 7671 indi-
viduals in NHANES III 1991­94, and 7288 individuals
in the combined NHANES 1999­2000 and 2001­02
surveys.
Measures
RBC, also known as erythrocyte, folate is a marker
of long-term folate status. RBC folate concentrations
were assessed in NHANES III using two different
methods. Prior to November 1993, RBC concentra-
tions were assayed using the Quanta Phase I Folate
Radioassay Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA,
USA), while from December 1993 onward the Quanta
Phase II Folate Radioassay Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA, USA) that was also used by NHANES
1999­2000 and 2001­02 surveys. The CDC has applied
a correction factor to the earlier NHANES III assays
to account for incorrect calibration, and detailed
1060 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
laboratory procedures for the two surveys are avail-
able elsewhere.25­27
We used a dichotomous measure for whether the
individual has low RBC folate using a previously estab-
lished cut-point of <362.6 nmol (160 mg/l).17,28 Contin-
uous values of RBC folate were used to examine
distributions of RBC folate before and after fortifica-
tion. Income was divided into quartiles based on the
poverty income ratio (PIR), defined as the ratio of a
family's income to their appropriate threshold income
based on household size. Since the NHANES surveys do
not disclose the year in which an individual was inter-
viewed within a wave, using the PIR ensures compa-
rable inflation-adjusted measures across survey years.
Race­ethnicity was represented in three categories:
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black and Mexican-
American.
Statistical analysis
We calculated crude absolute differences in prevalence
and relative prevalence ratios directly from tabulation
of prevalence rates across income quartiles and sepa-
rately for race/ethnic groups. We used a multivariable
poisson regression model to calculate the prevalence
ratio and adjusted absolute differences for low RBC
folate status by income quartile and race/ethnicity,
adjusting for age and sex. Income and race/ethnicity
are simultaneously adjusted in the poisson models.
Since robust error variance is not compatible with
adjustment for complex survey design, we used the
more conservative (wider) confidence intervals pro-
vided by STATA's survey commands. Kernel density
estimates were used to examine smoothed distribu-
tions of continuous RBC folate by income groups and
race/ethnicity before and after fortification. Relative
and absolute concentration curves and indices for
income were created by plotting the cumulative
proportion of the sample ranked by income quartile
on the X-axis against the cumulative proportion
of cases of low RBC folate status on the Y-axis.
All analyses were carried out using STATA statistical
software version 10.0 adjusting for complex survey
design (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Figure 1 displays the changes in the continuous
distribution of RBC folate in different groups before
and after fortification. Here, we see a significant
population shift in exposure following folic acid forti-
fication. While the distributions for RBC folate have
universally shifted to the right, it is clear that income and
racial/ethnic differentials in low folate status still remain
following fortification. Figure 2 shows relative and
absolute concentration curves for income and low RBC
folate status before and after fortification. Similarly,
these calculations show that low RBC folate status
became relatively more concentrated among the poor
following fortification, reflected by a 179% increase in the

Relative Concentration Index (RCI). The Absolute
Concentration Index (ACI), on the other hand, declined
by 53.9%, reflecting the dramatic decreases in low RBC
folate status for all income groups.
Table 1 shows both the crude relative and absolute
inequalities in low folate status by income and race/
ethnicity before and after fortification. Following forti-
fication, the prevalence of low folate status dropped
from 528 to 110/1000 for the lowest income quartile
while the change in the highest income quartile was
from 374 to 42/1000. The excess prevalence for the
lowest income quartile thus dropped from 155 to
67/1000 following fortification, a drop of 57%. Prior to
fortification, the prevalence ratio of low folate status
for the lowest vs highest income groups was 1.41 (95%
CI: 1.32­1.52). Post-fortification, this prevalence ratio
increased to 2.59 (95% CI: 2.01­3.32), despite the 57%
decrease in absolute excess prevalence.
The bottom portion of Table 1 illustrates similar
results by race/ethnicity. The prevalence of low folate
status in non-Hispanic blacks dropped by 476/1000
following fortification. For Hispanics, the crude risk
fell by 426/1000 and for non-Hispanic whites the risk
fell by 289/1000. In absolute terms, the excess prev-
alence for non-Hispanic blacks compared with non-
Hispanic whites fell 58%. Despite these absolute
gains, the prevalence ratio for non-Hispanic blacks
compared with non-Hispanic whites increased following
fortification from 1.98 (95% CI: 1.86­2.10) to 4.54
(95% CI: 3.76­5.50). For Hispanics, excess prevalence
compared with non-Hispanic whites fell a dramatic
87% from 158 to 20/1000, while the prevalence ratio
remained fairly constant at 1.53 (95% CI: 1.22­1.92) vs
1.48 (95% CI: 1.38­1.59) prior to fortification.
Table 2 shows the relative prevalence ratio of low RBC
folate status adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity and
income quartile based on a poisson regression model.
These models confirm our unadjusted results, showing
that the prevalence ratio of low RBC folate status
increased for non-Hispanic blacks vs non-Hispanic
whites and the lowest vs the highest income quartile
following fortification. For non-Hispanic blacks com-
pared with non-Hispanic whites, the prevalence ratio
for low folate status increased from 1.64 (95% CI
1.42­1.89) to 3.75 (95% CI 2.83­4.98) after fortification.
For the bottom income quartile compared with the
top, the relative ratio increased from 1.27 (95% CI
1.12­1.43) to 2.08 (95% CI 1.60­2.70).
Table 2 also shows absolute prevalence differences
before and after fortification adjusted for age, sex,
race/ethnicity and income quartile. We see a similar
pattern to the unadjusted results, whereby absolute
differences in the prevalence of low RBC folate status
decline steeply after fortification. The estimated excess
prevalence for non-Hispanic blacks compared with
non-Hispanic Whites fell 48%, and the excess
prevalence for the lowest vs highest income quartile
fell 67%.

Discussion
Few public health interventions are as far reaching as
fortification of the national food supply. While previous
work has documented general trends in folate status
following FDA mandated fortification,16­18 this study
explicitly examined changes in relative and absolute
disparities in folate status by race/ethnicity and income
following fortification. The results of this study confirm
that all income and racial/ethnic groups in the US
benefited in absolute terms from the FDA mandated

FOLIC ACID FORTIFICATION AND HEALTH DISPARITIES 1063
folic acid fortification policy that took affect January
1998. Mean levels of RBC folate increased dramatically
in all groups, with a consequent drop in the percentage
of individuals classified as having low RBC folate. This
large overall improvement lead to a dramatic decline in
absolute income and racial inequalities in low RBC
folate status following fortification. Nonetheless, those
individuals remaining with low RBC folate status fol-
lowing fortification were more concentrated in groups
with lower income and non-Hispanic black race.
Lynch et al.29 have recently highlighted the impor-
tance of examining social disparities based on absolute
risk measures such as the excess risk difference, since
relative measures can emphasize differences in risk
across groups that do not necessarily account for the
majority of cases of the outcome of interest. This can
occur when the risk factor accounting for a majority of
cases of a particular outcome does not vary significantly
by subgroup. When the major risk factor is eliminated
or greatly reduced, any remaining group differences in
risk may appear large on the relative scale, even though
those risk factors account for very few total cases in
the populations.29 This scenario parallels our pre- and
post-fortification population, where the fortification
intervention has broadly reduced the largest risk of
low RBC folate status, namely low dietary intake of
folic acid. Because risk has dropped so precipitously for
all groups, remaining risk differences across income or
race can look large on the relative scale even when the
total number of cases has been greatly reduced.
Recent work by Keppel employed a relative measure
of disparity to identify the 10 largest racial and ethnic
health disparities in the US.30 Keppel acknowledges
the limitations of such a relative approach, since the
absolute differences and thus the true public health
impact are not revealed from such a perspective. While
relative measures such as those used by Keppel are
necessary to compare inequalities in outcomes mea-
sured on different scales, our study further highlights
the risk in assuming that the size of a relative associa-
tion provides information on the public health signif-
icance. The strength of a relative measure depends upon
the distribution of complementary causal components
in a population and is population dependent, therefore.
Despite the large improvements in overall levels of
folate following fortification, disparities, whether mea-
sured by an absolute or relative metric, still persist.
What factors might account for the remaining racial/
ethnic and income differences in folate status? Apart
from enriched grains, legumes and vegetables (espe-
cially leafy greens) are important dietary sources
folate.19 There is some evidence of socioeconomic
differences in diet and nutrition. Lower income, lower
educational attainment and non-Hispanic black ethni-
city are associated with lower intake of fruits, vege-
tables and essential nutrients, and higher intake of total
fat in the US.31­34 Similar patterns have been found
in other developed countries such as Britain, Australia,
Denmark, Switzerland and The Netherlands.35­41
A growing literature is examining the role that neigh-
bourhoods and access to healthy foods might play
in these disparities.31,42,43 Studies of racial and ethnic
differences in folate intake from different sources
suggests that differences in folic acid supplement
intake account for a majority of racial/ethnic disparities
in folate levels in the US. These studies show that food
folate intake means and medians are quite similar
across racial/ethnic groups both before and after forti-
fication, while intake from supplements is dramatically
higher for non-Hispanic whites.18,44
Recent work has shown that despite fortification,
most women still do not consume enough folic acid to
meet the Institute of Medicine's recommendation of
400 mg/day to reduce the risk of neural tube defects and
these rates vary significantly by race/ethnicity.44 Since
clinically relevant disparities in folic acid and folate
levels still persist, should public health researchers push
for fortification levels to be increased? There is evidence
that many products may contain higher levels of folic
acid than required by FDA regulation, leading to a
higher increase in folic acid intake from fortified foods
than was expected by the FDA.19,45 This has contributed
to concern that fortification could raise intake above
safe limits for some individuals, which can mask B12
deficiency and lead to irreversible neurological dam-
age, especially in the elderly.46,47 Currently, no database
exists in the US that contains information on the
amount of folic acid contained in foods, and manu-
facturer food labels have been found to be unreli-
able.19,45 This makes estimating the potential effects of
higher fortification levels difficult, and higher levels
of mandated fortification would likely be controversial.
Remaining income and racial/ethnic disparities will
likely need to be addressed by health care professionals
and public health approaches that encourage targeted
consumption of folic acid supplements, especially for
women of child-bearing ages and those in high risk
socioeconomic and race/ethnic groups.
There are several considerations regarding the inter-
pretation of our study findings. First, our analysis does
not examine changes in other trends such as dietary
or supplement intake by subgroup that might also have
contributed to changes in folate disparities over the
time period examined. Nevertheless, our goal was to
examine the potential for a far-reaching policy such
as folic acid fortification to reduce disparities in folate
status above and beyond the influence of other con-
current changes in behaviours or other risk factors
over this period. Recent work has examined specific
sources of racial/ethnic differences in folate intake such
as supplement use before and after fortification, and
future work could do the same for income differences.
Another limitation is that a one-time measurement of
economic status, such as income, may be measured
with error and/or not reflect broader dimensions of SES
such as wealth, thus underestimating the relationship
1064 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
between SES and folate status both before and after
fortification.
The 1998 FDA folic acid fortification policy was a
successful example of Geoffrey Rose's goal of improv-
ing population health by shifting the entire distribu-
tion of a health risk rather than exclusively targeting
high risk individuals.48 Nonetheless, it is notable that
even with an intervention as aggressive as fortifying
the food supply, neither absolute levels of popula-
tion prevalence or disparities in the prevalence of
low folate status have been completely eliminated.
Given the difficulty in reducing disparities to zero
even with such a large-scale intervention, it is impor-
tant for public health officials to track absolute as
well as relative disparities when prioritizing the health
disparities that should receive the greatest attention
and resources.

Population-level changes in folate intake by age, gender,
KEY MESSAGES
 In the period following folic acid fortification in the US, the absolute prevalence of low RBC folate fell
dramatically for all racial/ethnic and income groups.
 While absolute disparities in low RBC folate status by race/ethnicity and income fell following
fortification, relative measures of inequality increased as the prevalence of low RBC folate status
became concentrated in more disadvantaged groups.
 Targeting of high risk populations is likely needed to eliminate remaining folate disparities in the US.
