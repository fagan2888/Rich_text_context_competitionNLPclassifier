Both H.D. (Hilda Doolittle) and Virginia Woolf were
intrigued by the potentialities of intersubjectivity--shared
meaning, thought, and experience--that media technologies
in the first half of the 20th century made possible on a far
wider scale than previously imagined or experienced. For
H.D., the images produced by the projector bridge differ-
ences created by conventional language, culture, and nation-
ality, thus creating intersubjectivity. Her poems, "Projector"
and "Projector II (Chang)," celebrate the reassertion of light
as deity and speak to the importance of the machine--the
projector--that makes this reification possible. By contrast,
Virginia Woolf privileges the aural in much of her writings,
illustrating in many of her early novels that sound creates the
intersubjective moment. Woolf's last novel, Between the
Acts, is a sustained interrogation of the role of media technol-
ogy in creating and maintaining intersubjectivity, for there
exists within intersubjectivity a challenge to the individual's
ability to know and to act with agency. Both authors under-
stood the dangers associated when the intersubjective
moment is generated by and dependent upon a machine.
Obeying mechanical directives alienates one from one of the
defining characteristics of the human: agency, or the ability
to act. When Woolf (1970) writes in Between the Acts, "They
were neither one thing nor the other; neither Victorians nor
themselves. They were suspended without being, in limbo"
(p. 178), she is considering the audience's sense of them-
selves. However, she is also illustrating that those whose
position as the subject is challenged exist in a sort of limbo--
they are neither their own autonomous self nor are they truly
merged with the group. Intersubjectivity might unify, it
might bridge differences, but it also challenges the autonomy
of the self, ultimately destabilizing the privileged position of
the subject even as it fails to unify members of the group.
The media technologies of the early 20th century seemed
uniquely qualified to pose such a challenge.
By the first decade of the 20th century, both sound and
image technologies had pervaded mainstream culture. Media
technologies such as the gramophone and the film projectors
served as reminders that objects have a life of their own.1 In
his essay "Thing Theory," Bill Brown (2001) notes "the sud-
denness with which things seem to assert their presence and
power: you cut your finger on a sheet of paper, you trip over
some toy, you get bopped on the head by a nut," and argues
that these moments "are occasions of contingency--the
chance interruption--that disclose a physicality of things"
(pp. 3-4). Thus, objects are more than simply the results of
production and consumption. They exert a presence in their
environment, reminding the humans who live with them that
their space is shared--sometimes pleasantly and sometimes
with the disruption that arises from the perversity of inani-
mate objects. Thus, media technologies played a role in pre-
paring the modernist writer to consider the potential agency
of objects. The gramophone, for example, not only played

"They Were Neither One Thing Nor the
Other": Media Technology's Challenge to
the Subject
Tabatha Hibbs1
Abstract
This essay will examine the way in which media technologies, through object agency, produce intersubjectivity and, thus,
challenge the autonomy of the self. For H.D. (Hilda Doolittle), the image produced by the cinema bridges differences
created by conventional language, culture, and nationality. Her poems, "Projector" and "Projector II (Chang)," celebrate
the importance of the projector that reasserts light as deity. By contrast, Virginia Woolf privileges sound in her search for
intersubjectivity. Woolf's last novel, Between the Acts, presents a much bleaker view--particularly of machine-generated
intersubjectivity--of the loss of autonomy in the rise of Hitler and Fascism.

back the human voices recorded on wax cylinders but also
recorded environmental white noise, sounds that the human
ear typically disregarded as meaningless. Furthermore, the
gramophone was quite capable of generating its own sounds:
hissing and scratching when the needle stuck, and "chuffing"
when the needle came to the end of the phonograph disc.2
Such sounds permeated the human body, dissolving ego
boundaries. Likewise, the projector produced images that
could be read across cultural and socioeconomic boundaries.
As both the physical boundary of the body and the social
boundaries of class and nation dissolved, new possibilities
for intersubjectivity emerged.
H.D. and Woolf are not alone in their interest in media
technologies. Such technologies as the phonograph, the
printing press, the typewriter, and the player piano appear in
other works as varied as Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Voice of
Silence," James Joyce's "Aeolus" from Ulysses, Bram
Stoker's Dracula, and Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent.
However, while each of these objects exercise some agency
in the texts, none challenge the position of the subject in the
way that H.D.'s projector and Woolf's gramophone do.
Furthermore, because H.D. privileges the visual in contrast
to Woolf's interrogation of the aural, examining the
"Projector" poems in tandem with Between the Acts allows
the opportunity to consider the influence of early media tech-
nologies on the senses in producing intersubjectivity and, as
a result, challenging the autonomy of the self.
Projected Gods and Intersubjectivity in
H.D.'s Writing
As an Imagist, H.D. privileged sight as "fresh, accurate
access to the exterior world" (Morris, 2003, p. 96). The tenets
of Imagism have been attributed to Ezra Pound (1913), who
declared that "[a]n `image' is that which presents an intel-
lectual and emotional complex in an instant of time" (p.
200). However, the movement saw its earliest beginnings in
the poetry group which had T. E. Hulme at its center. It is
from his thinking about poetry that the aesthetics of Imagism
developed, and Hulme (1955) privileges vision in his consid-
eration of the role of language in poetry, asserting, "A man
cannot write without seeing at the same time a visual signifi-
cation before his eyes. It is this image which precedes the
writing and makes it firm" (p. 79). This assertion suggests
that the physical eye, as much as the mind's eye, plays a vital
role in the creation of the image and, ultimately, the poem,
placing the instigating image--that image that is the starting
point of the poem--squarely in the realm of physical vision
rather than mental imagery.
Hulme's (1955) privileging of vision arises from his con-
tention that language is a "[l]arge clumsy instrument" that
"does not naturally come with meaning" (pp. 83-84). While
language might not be sufficient to communicate adequately
the writer's ideas, vision and the images perceived by vision
might very well be universal. Morris (2003) notes that for the
Imagist, "[s]ight is the acid bath that dissolves the sticky
sludge of rhetoric . . . [and] connects us directly . . . with the
things of this world" (p. 96). By contrast to those who privi-
leged the aural, Morris observes that the Imagists found "in
vision a release from a shared system of signs into a spontane-
ous, intuitive, unmediated apprehension of essences" (p. 97).
Yet, a poet works in language rather than in the visual as does
a painter or a photographer; thus, Hulme demands, "Each
word must be an image seen, not a counter" (p. 79). This ten-
sion, then, between sight and language, between the concrete
thing and the abstract word(s) used to represent that thing is
the foundation of the Imagist aesthetic. Within this aesthetic,
too, lies the desire, if unspoken, for the universal experience
of the emotion, of the moment, and of the thing that lies at the
poem's center, and that is the poem's raison d'être.
For H.D., the image rather than sound provided a means
to bridge differences created by the flawed and arbitrary
mediation of language and to create intersubjectivity.3
Although H.D. is best known for her poetry and prose, her
foray into film reveals her belief that a universal language,
the dissolution of differences, and the intersubjectivity that
might result were dependent upon the image: not the lan-
guage-dependent image created in poetry but the moving
image created by light projected through film. She declares
film "[a] perfect medium [that] has at last been granted us"
(H.D., 1998c, p. 112). This perfect medium is "a subtle
device for portraying the miraculous" (H.D., 1998c, p.
112)--a nod to H.D.'s (1998b) Imagist beginnings--but it is
also the medium by which "there would be no more misun-
derstandings . . . of nations" (p. 117). As Laura Marcus
(1998) observes, "The dream of recapturing a prelapsarian,
universal, pictographic language fed directly into early film
aesthetics" (p. 103). How better to find commonality in com-
munication than through pictures, for while language might
act as a barrier to shared understanding, H.D. believed
images would evoke a universal response from viewers.4
The search for a universal language is centuries old.
Umberto Eco dates the desire for what he terms a perfect
language to the second century A.D. when syncretism gave
rise to the belief in a universal World Soul. Because "[e]ach
language organizes the way in which we talk or think about
reality in its own particular way" (Eco, 1995, p. 21), a uni-
versal language could overcome different cultural and lin-
guistic perceptions of reality, thus making it possible for
those of differing nations to converse without the risk of mis-
understanding. Such linguistic commonality would promote
the sharing not only of ideas but also of consciousness. In
1887, Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof created Esperanto, an artifi-
cial language that he hoped would become the universal lan-
guage that had thus far eluded humankind, but despite its
relative ease of acquisition, Esperanto did not become the
single tongue of humankind. Instead, 19th-century visual
technologies such as photography and the cinema promised
to bridge cultural and linguistic differences more quickly and
effectively than any written or spoken language ever could.
Hibbs 3
Michael North (2005) observes that, initially, photography
was thought to be the new "Rosetta Stone, decoding every
written language by reference to a visual language common
to all" (p. 5). The same observation can be made about the
hopes for and beliefs about early cinema. Just as "photogra-
phy was strongly associated from its very beginnings with
hieroglyphs" (North, 2005, p. 5), so was "the image of (silent)
film" seen "as a form of hieroglyphics, a thinking in pictures
rather than words" (Marcus, 1998, p. 102). Such thinking in
pictures, which were more universal than language, might
create a shared experience and common understanding in
audiences from varying cultural and language backgrounds.
Béla Balázs noted, "[O]n the motion picture screens all over
the world we currently witness the development of the first
international language: that of facial expression and physical
gestures" (as cited in Hansen, 1991, p. 188).5 Film images
then could form the "halo of visual connotations" (Eco, 1995,
p. 149) denied to the writer of poetry and prose, whose work
would be understood only by those who shared the same lan-
guage experiences as the writer.
Thus, if images could overcome differences, then con-
sciousness might be shared with others. This was a hope
widely expressed during the first decades of the 20th century.
H.D. shared this enthusiasm and belief that unity might be
created by the projected image, and she wrote ecstatically
about this, as well as about both light and film in the early
issues of Close Up. In a June 1927 letter to Viola Jordan,
H.D. writes, "I feel [film] is the living art, that thing that
WILL count but that is in danger now from commnerical
[sic] and popular sources" (as cited in Marek, 1995, p. 129).
Her belief in film and "its ability to transform the human
soul" (Marek, 1995, p. 133) permeates the reviews and com-
mentaries that she wrote for Close Up during its first two
years of circulation. Not surprisingly, the film aesthetics she
espoused were similar to those that shaped much of her
poetry. In a series of interlinking essays called "The Cinema
and the Classics," the poet gave voice to her ideas of film
aesthetics and her hopes of the role that cinema might fill.6
H.D. saw film as an opportunity to create art that could cross
national boundaries and believed that her essays could help
shape this art and help it resist the commercial pressures of
Hollywood.
In addition to establishing her theory of film aesthetics,
H.D. also used her contributions to Close Up as a venue for
her celebration of light. In the essay "The Cinema and the
Classics I: Restraint," she declared, "[t]he fascinating ques-
tion of light alone could occupy one forever" (H.D., 1998b,
p. 111). Her adoration of light winds through her contribu-
tions to Close Up, and light takes on mystical properties in
the two "Projector" poems she published in the July and
October issues of the magazine. However, while her writing
celebrates light and film, the projector is the ultimate source
of the light that H.D. deifies in her writing. The idea of pro-
jection pervades H.D.'s poetry. Projection is, as Morris
(2003) observes,
the thrust that bridges two worlds. It is the movement across a
borderline: between the mind and the wall, between the brain
and the page . . . between me and you . . . across dimensions of
time and space. (p. 96)
Thus, the medium of film provided the poet a way to approach
her "broader concerns with language and symbol, psycho-
analysis, mysticism and spiritualism, classicism, and the cel-
ebration of women's beauty and power" (Marcus, 1998, p.
98). Within the walls of the cinema, projected light reached
across the dark to cast images upon a screen, images that
promised in many ways to overcome social and national dif-
ferences, and to become a universal language that might
unite viewers when phonetic language failed. Projected light
is made possible by the projector, a fact celebrated in the
poems "Projector" and "Projector II."
Even as the projector's dynamism and agency made pos-
sible light's reassumption of power in modern culture, it is
the light that most enamored H.D, who situated it as a reani-
mation of Apollo. Laura Marcus (1998) reads the two
Projector poems as "invocations to Apollo, upon whom
[H.D.] bestows the godhead of cinema" (p. 98). In H.D.'s
writing, light is both the tool of the artist and an entity to be
deified. In writing of Kenneth Macpherson's work on the
film Borderline, H.D. notes that "those lights have been
arranged, re-arranged deliberately focussed [sic]. Those who
know anything, even of the technique of mere photography,
realise that Macpherson sculpts literally with light" (H.D.,
1998a, p. 227). Here, light is something to be managed and
to be manipulated; it "is pliant, is malleable. Light is our
friend and our god. Let us be worthy of it" (H.D., 1998c, p.
112). The notion that light is both a friend and a god is clearly
articulated in "Projector" where the acknowledgment of
light's power in the making of films becomes the language of
adoration:
O fair and blest,
[light] strides forth young and pitiful and strong,
a kind of blazing splendour and of gold,
and all the evil
and the tyrannous wrong
that beauty suffered
finds its champion,
light
who is god
and song. (H.D., 1983a, pp. 349-350)
4 SAGE Open
The entity in these lines is a benevolent deity that restores
order and beauty even as it asserts its authority. Its authority,
however, is not omnipotent. Adalaide Morris (2003) reads
"Projector" as H.D.'s evocation of Apollo as "the god of cin-
ema" (p. 104). While such a reading speaks to H.D.'s affinity
for Greek classicism, it does not consider H.D.'s own
acknowledgment that light is something that can be manipu-
lated. H.D.'s assertion that light is pliant and malleable sug-
gests that its deification is limited, subject to the vision and
skills of the film's director. Ultimately, too, light's power
exists through the "mighty rays" (H.D., 1983a, p. 350) of the
projector that creates them. As such, light is a god dependent
on media technology for both its existence and its ability to
"snare . . . in a net" (H.D., 1983b, p. 356) the film's
audience.
Even so, H.D. continues her analogy of light as a god
returned when she suggests that the cinema is a modern tem-
ple. In "Projector," she writes that light "lifts up a fair head/
in a lowly place/shows his splendour/ in a little room" (H.D.,
1983a, pp. 351). The poem's speaker explains, "we had no
temple and no temple fire" (H.D., 1983a, p. 351), suggesting
that the return of light in the form of film creates a place of
worship and meditation within the space of the cinema. This
is reiterated in "Projector II" when the speaker declares the
light "draws us to his altar;/ we worship who no more/ see
star in Grecian water" (H.D., 1983b, pp. 356). The role of
cinema as church is most clearly articulated in "The Mask
and the Movietone" where H.D. (1998b) writes, "Then we
sank into light, into darkness, the cinema palace . . . became
a sort of temple . . . The cinema has become to us what the
church was to our ancestors" (p. 116). For H.D., the cinema
is a place to worship this new god, and the light-god created
by the projector is a source of solace and comfort. This god
promises relief from suffering by "turn[ing] . . . pain to bliss"
(H.D., 1983b, p. 356). The ecstasy experienced by the wor-
shippers in the cinema-temple is expressed by the poem's
speaker, who proclaims:
This is his gift;
light,
light
a wave
that sweeps
us
from old fears
and powers
and disenchantments; (H.D., 1983b, pp. 354)
The tone of religious ecstasy continues as the light-god
speaks in the last three sections of "Projector II" when it
declares the audience is one with him: "You are myself being
free/ as bird/ or humming-bee" (H.D., 1983b, pp. 357).
Although the light-god promises spiritual unification with its
people, the reader is reminded of the physical limitations of
this deity, for its power is confined to the space of the cin-
ema. The light-god may promise the faithful they can "live
lives that might have been,/ live lives that ever are" (H.D.,
1983b, pp. 358), but this can be done only with their "souls
upon the screen" (H.D., 1983b, p. 358). Without the darkness
of the cinema, without the screen as a canvas for images,
and, most importantly, without the projector's "ray[s] of
gilded light" (H.D., 1983b, p. 357), H.D.'s light-god has nei-
ther power nor existence.
In addition to film providing solace to the worshippers in
the cinema-temple, H.D. believed that film had the ability to
unify and to overcome differences. She expresses the belief
that such unity is possible in "Projector" when light
in a new blaze of splendor
calls the host
to reassemble
and to readjust
all severing
and differing of thought,
all strife and strident bickering
and rest; (H.D., 1983a, pp. 349)
Laura Marcus (1998) observes that "[t]he broader context
for H.D.'s conceptualizations of film is, undoubtedly, the
concept and dream of a `universal language'" (p. 102). A
universal language would be possible if film images func-
tioned as modern hieroglyphics. Such images would speak
to the shared associations long embedded in the human
conscious, associations buried but not eroded by differ-
ences in regional and national cultures. These images would
exist between conscious minds and would transcend the
barriers of language so that audience members would expe-
rience a shared understanding. Such a picture language
would overcome the differences in culture and the lack of
understanding resulting from spoken language, thus ensur-
ing a reduction of misunderstandings between people and
between nations, as well as a greater tolerance for one
another's differences. Such understanding and tolerance
might prevent another Great War. These were the hopes
H.D. had for the cinema and for the reawakened light-god
in the 20th century.
Hibbs 5
Despite these hopes, H.D. expresses some ambivalence in
her writing about the cinema as temple and light as the new
god. Her celebration of light and her belief in the ability of
film to overcome differences are tempered by her realization
that a certain mindlessness and loss of agency might occur
within the cinema-temple. In "The Mask and the Movietone,"
she writes, "we depended on light, on some sub-strata of
warmth," likening the audience to "moths in darkness . . .
hypnotized by cross currents and interacting shades of light
and darkness" (H.D., 1998b, p. 116). If the audience is spell-
bound or enchanted, then spiritual or intellectual awareness
becomes difficult, if not impossible. There is no need to
engage with the images on the screen or with the narrative
they represent. It is enough to observe the images and to
receive light's gift of bliss. The cinema, then, might very
well be modernism's opiate of the masses, serving to numb
the audience to the pressures and challenges of daily life.
Of course, the light that hypnotizes the audiences through-
out "Projector II" is possible only through the functioning of
the projector. The projector of H.D.'s poems is a dynamic
object, capable of exerting influence over and challenging
the agency of those in its immediate proximity. It is this
machine's ability to influence, to hypnotize, that gives H.D.
pause even as she celebrates film's potential to create inter-
subjectivity among the audience members. While light might
be the proximate god worshipped by the theater-going sup-
plicants, the projector is the ultimate source of the light and
the images. The light-god of the cinema promises solace and
comfort, but it is the projector--the machine--to which the
audience submits its will and agency. Thus, the silent pic-
tures that H.D. believes will unify the audience are possible
only because of the machine projecting those images upon
the screen. Thus, the images are mechanized, just as is the
light-god that is projected upon the screen. More importantly,
the machine that projects both the light and the images sits
behind the audience and so goes unnoticed in the dim light of
the cinema. The projector then is a god that projects light
away from itself. The supplicants, too, face away from the
source of the light and become lost in the projector's hyp-
notic effect of "interacting shades of light and darkness"
(H.D., 1998b, p. 116), forgetting they are worshipping the
product of a mechanized society. Ultimately, as the speaker
of "Projector II" declares,
your being is my grace
(he says)
your life, my life;
I catch you in my net
of light on over-light;
you are not any more,
being one with snake and bear,
with leopard
and with panther;
you have no life who taste
all life
with bear and lynx; (H.D., 1983b, pp. 356)
The ambivalence of these lines echoes H.D.'s own uncer-
tainty toward the cinema that seemed to fulfill the dream of a
universal language and intersubjectivity even as it obscured
the individuality of those it united in its light.
Subjects, Objects, and Gramophones:
Woolf and Intersubjectivity
Like H.D., Virginia Woolf was profoundly interested in the
possibility of intersubjectivity created by media technolo-
gies. Even more than the poet, Woolf eventually grew to dis-
trust mediated intersubjectivity, particularly auditory media,
and the loss of human agency that could result. Woolf had a
long interest in sound and the intersubjectivity it could pro-
duce and had previously considered sound's ability to create
connections between characters and their world in her earlier
novels. Such connections were treated in a generally positive
light. However, Between the Acts takes a much bleaker view
of these connections, particularly in regard to machine-gen-
erated intersubjectivity. The gramophone's agency, expressed
by the machine's sounds during the pageant, challenges the
subjectivity of those gathered to watch the pageant. The
machine's chuffing and ticking are cues that direct the audi-
ence's movements, so that the humans, while sharing feel-
ings of patriotism elicited by the pageant and its music,
become objects to be manipulated. The gramophone, by con-
trast, seems to develop a life of its own. By using the sounds
made by the gramophone, Woolf is able to illustrate both the
intersubjectivity that results when the ego's boundaries are
dissolved and the dangers that arise when the individual
merges with a group, thus interrogating her own political
views and diminishing hope in the face of the growing power
of Nazi Germany.7
Like many modernist writers who came of age during the
late 19th century swell of media technologies, Woolf was
preoccupied with the role of the senses in organizing and
understanding individual experience, although her attention
was drawn in particular to the aural. While she did not ana-
lyze sound or its impact upon her daily life, her diary entries
are rich with references to sound. Despite her interest in
sound, despite even her tendency to privilege the aural,
Woolf, as Melba Cuddy-Keane (2000) observes, was "rather
negative about the sound of the gramophone which
6 SAGE Open
frequently in her writing `brays' or `blares' or gets stuck in a
worn groove" (p. 75). Nor was she overly enamored with the
wireless or, more particularly, the BBC. Cuddy-Keane also
notes that "Woolf . . . was not an extensive commentator on
technology; its effect has to be found in its pervasive pres-
ence throughout her work" (p. 74). The few comments she
makes tend to be found in her letters rather than in pieces
written for public consumption. In her letter to Ethel Smyth
dated January 6, 1933, Woolf (1975) writes,
I agree with you--the wireless is a humbug--a mere travesty
and distortionment [sic]--I get more pain from it than pleasure.
What with the Germans cutting in and the voice of your friend
God Almighty--growling and grumbling. (p. 146)
Although she had reservations about sound technology,
Woolf recognized that such technologies could play an
important role in creating the connections between people
that she tried to create in her own art.
Such connections were critical to both Woolf's politics
and her aesthetics. She writes in Three Guineas
that the public and private worlds are inseparably connected . . .
A common interests unites us; it is one world, one life . . . we are
reminded of other connections that lie far deeper than the facts
on the surface . . . even now your letter tempts us . . . to listen not
to the bark of the guns and the bray of the gramophones but to
the voices of the poets, answering each other, assuring us of a
unity that rubs out divisions as if they were chalk marks only.
(Woolf, 1966, pp. 142-143)
The connections of which Woolf writes suggest the possibil-
ity of an intersubjectivity existing between people of differ-
ent genders, different politics, and different socioeconomic
statuses. Angela Frattarola (2009) argues that in many of
Woolf's novels, including in Between the Acts, sound is
"used to connect a character to the world" (p. 139). Because,
as David Michael Levin (1989) notes, sound does not "stop
at the boundaries set by the egocentric body" (p. 32), sound
is a means of overcoming the isolation that occurs when the
visual is privileged.8 As the physical body is penetrated by
sound and the individual ego is overcome, connections are
formed. These connections between character and the world,
as well as to the other characters in the novel, become the
means to create the intersubjectivity that Woolf believed
could be achieved in the real world. Readers might be united
by the experience of the novel, even as her characters are
united by the sounds in their fictional world.
While Woolf idealized the intersubjectivity that might be
possible through art, by the time she wrote her final novel, she
had developed reservations about intersubjectivity and the use
of media technology to promote the nationalist fervor on which
Nazism fed. Between the Acts was written between 1938 and
1941, during a period in which Hitler began his assimilation of
Europe. During this time, Woolf (1980) also listened to broad-
casts by both Hitler and Churchill and recognized the tendency
of any government to use sound to create unity among its citi-
zens: "When the 12 planes went over, out to sea, to fight, last
evening, I had I think an individual, not communal BBC dic-
tated feeling. I almost instinctively wished them luck" (p. 306).
That Woolf sought to create intersubjectivity within her work
yet resisted the imposition of government inspired and con-
trolled unity suggests a compelling ambivalence on her part.
In Between the Acts, the gramophone and its agency illus-
trate Woolf's ambivalence toward media technologies and
the intersubjectivity they can produce. Miss La Trobe, the
director of the pageant, is astute in her selection and use of
music to manage the audience, but the gramophone asserts
itself so that it becomes the director of the audience even as
Miss La Trobe directs the pageant. Audience management
begins with the opening moments of the pageant when the
"[c]huff, chuff, chuff sounded from the bushes" gets their
attention: "Then the play began. Was it, or was it not, the
play? . . . Some sat down hastily; others stopped talking
guiltily" (Woolf, 1970, p. 76). The audience is prepared to
respond to cues that the show is about to begin. Particularly
compelling here is the audience's willingness to attend to the
"noise a machine makes when something has gone wrong"
(Woolf, 1970, p. 76). It is not pleasant melodies nor profound
dialogue that attracts the audience's notice, but the chuffing
of a machine that fails to work properly.
As the gramophone expresses its agency, its ability to
influence is apparent: "All looked at the bushes. For the stage
was empty. Chuff, chuff, chuff the machine buzzed in the
bushes" (Woolf, 1970, p. 76). With no one on stage to begin
the performance, the audience looks to the most obvious
source for direction and confirmation of correct behavior: the
misbehaving gramophone. In her discussion of how "tech-
nology has . . . produced our current understanding of sound,"
Cuddy-Keane (2000) observes that "the phonograph enabled
people to think of sound as an autonomous entity in itself"
(pp. 70-71). Sound was not inextricably linked to a physical
object in the way that color and shape had to be. As a result,
the gramophone's chuffing becomes the master of ceremo-
nies, an unseen manager of the audience and the pageant.
Through this persona, the gramophone continues its manage-
ment role throughout the pageant. As with many amateur
performances, the play is beset by forgotten lines, miscues,
and general confusion among the actors, so that the stage is
often empty. Without the guidance of the gramophone, even
in its malfunctioning, the audience would have been adrift:
Chuff, chuff, chuff went the machine. Could they talk? Could
they move? No, for the play was going on. Yet the stage was
empty; only the cows moved in the meadows; only the tick of
the gramophone needle was heard. The tick, tick, tick seemed to
hold them together, tranced. Nothing whatsoever appeared on
the stage. (Woolf, 1970, p. 82)
Even when the stage is occupied by performers, the sounds
and the music "brayed and blared" (Woolf, 1970, p. 79) by
Hibbs 7
the gramophone are often all that the audience hears, for the
"half [the] words" of the actors are "blown away" by the
wind (Woolf, 1970, p. 78). It is the chuffing of the machine,
not the speaking and singing of the performers, that dissolves
ego boundaries; the gramophone's sounds, however unpleas-
ant they may be, unite the individuals in the audience. The
intersubjective moment is created by a machine rather than
by the actors. By tacitly agreeing to follow the implied direc-
tive of the gramophone, the audience members lose their
agency, becoming objects to be manipulated by the machine
and, as a result, losing some of what it means to be human.
Not only does the gramophone provide the initial cues to
the audience that the performance is to begin, the machine's
agency is instrumental in directing audience behavior during
the intervals between the pageant's acts. At the close of the
first act, the gramophone "chants," "moans," and "laments"
the chorus, "Dispersed are we" (Woolf, 1970, p. 95), cuing
the audience to move from their seats to enjoy the tea served
during the intermission. The dispersing audience struggles
momentarily with their dismissal--Dodge wonders whether
to "go or stay" while Giles questions whom to follow (Woolf,
1970, p. 96). Both men, as well as the other audience mem-
bers, are unsure how to disconnect themselves from the
group. However, as the gramophone continues the chorus,
the audience complies, dispersing, only to return when "[t]he
music summon[s] them" (Woolf, 1970, p. 118) for the next
act. They "sink down peacefully into the nursery rhyme . . .
fold their hands and compose their faces" (Woolf, 1970, p.
122). Although the music and the nursery rhymes have been
selected by Miss La Trobe, it is the gramophone's blaring of
these melodies that catches and holds the audience's atten-
tion permeating their ego boundaries to reestablish intersub-
jectivity. During a later interval, it is the "tick, tick of the
gramophone" (Woolf, 1970, p. 154) that holds the audience
together despite their inclination to wander the gardens and
see the house. Since the pageant's opening moments, the
audience has followed the machine's directives--whether
they were the clear instructions to disperse or the more
obscure chuffing call to attend. The machine's sounds have
now penetrated their individual boundaries to unite them into
a group, and it is to the machine's directives that the audience
most consistently responds, abandoning their agency to
assume the role of the object, if only temporarily.
The gramophone also shapes the self-perception of the
audience.As they attend to the sounds and music produced by
the machine, the audience members become aware of the dis-
solution of their ego boundaries: "The inner voice, the other
voice was saying: How can we deny that this brave music,
wafted from the bushes is expressive of some inner har-
mony?" (Woolf, 1970, p. 119).9 This brave music unites the
individual both as audience members and as British subjects;
their experiences are similar, as is the language that attempts
to organize and assign meaning to those experiences.
Furthermore, they recognize the pressures of daily life in dis-
rupting such intersubjectivity: "`When we wake' (some were
thinking) `the day breaks us with its hard mallet blows.' `The
office . . . compels disparity'" (Woolf, 1970, p. 119). By con-
trast to their daily lives, the dissolution of their ego boundar-
ies precipitated by the gramophone's sounds and music allows
the audience to enjoy moments of intersubjectivity and a
sense of belonging. No one is excluded for they understand
that "(m)usic wakes us. Music makes us see the hidden, join
the broken" (Woolf, 1970, p. 120). For a while, they are no
longer the "scraps, orts, and fragments" (Woolf, 1970, p. 189)
that is their usual state of being but are joined into a unified
whole. The unity achieved by the audience is reflective of
Lucy's worldview, which includes all living things:
Sheep, cows, grass, trees, ourselves--all are one. If discordant,
producing harmony--if not to us, to a gigantic ear attached to a
gigantic head . . . and so . . . we reach the conclusion that all is
harmony, could we hear it. And we shall. (Woolf, 1970, p. 175)
The music La Trobe has chosen speaks to the sense of the
audience as "British"; however, it is the gramophone that
first unifies the pageant's attendees as an audience, which is
a more immediate and physically relevant collective than the
national identity provided by La Trobe. As such, the indi-
vidual audience members are acquiescent in this union with
the larger group.
While the audience members embrace their union with
the larger group, they also resist complete and lasting immer-
sion. This resistance begins even as they assemble prior to
the pageant's prelude. Initially, the audience is defined as
having nothing to do--They have gathered on the lawn only
to wait for chairs to be brought. Although the gramophone's
sounds have not yet begun to dissolve ego boundaries, those
milling about the lawn have begun the transformation from
individual to group. However, they resist this consolidation:
They were silent. They stared at the view as if something might
happen in one of those fields to relieve them of the intolerable
burden of sitting silent, doing nothing in company. Their minds
and bodies were too close, yet not close enough. We aren't free,
each one of them felt separately, to feel or think separately . . .
We're too close; but not close enough. (Woolf, 1970, p. 65)
This tension between the need to separate and the need to
belong is lessened by the gramophone's initial chuffs and
ticks, but the individual's resistance to complete immersion
in the group never completely fades as is illustrated during
the interval following the "Victorian Age." The music has
stopped, and the gramophone chuffs and ticks in the bushes.
Now, however, the sounds that had earlier cued the audi-
ence's behavior and held the individuals together as a group
become "maddening" (Woolf, 1970, p. 176). Their earlier
intersubjectivity has been challenged by their competing per-
ceptions of the Victorian era--a period within living memory
of some of the audience. Mrs. Jones recalls her home and her
father reading, believes "it was beautiful" although possibly
a bit "unhygienic" (Woolf, 1970, pp. 173-174), while Etty
8 SAGE Open
Springett views the act as "[c]heap and nasty" (Woolf, 1970,
p. 173). Lucy does not "believe . . . that there ever were such
people. Only you and me and William dressed differently"
(Woolf, 1970, p. 175). Lucy's assessment speaks to her gen-
eral belief in an underlying harmony that unifies all life, that
any differences are as superficial as one's dress. For the oth-
ers, however, their differing perceptions begin the reassem-
bly of the boundaries that normally separate the individual,
so they begin to feel "caught and caged; prisoners; watching
a spectacle" (Woolf, 1970, p. 176). The dissolution of the
group continues throughout the last act, "Present Time.
Ourselves," culminating in the physical dispersal of the audi-
ence to the gramophone's repetitious "Dispersed Are We"
(Woolf, 1970, p. 196).
Karen Schneider (1989) suggests that psychic distress of
the war "undermined [Woolf's] faith in the validity of her
vision of an ultimate, unified reality underlying apparent
fragmentation" (p. 95). Certainly, the "retreating, withdraw-
ing, and dispersing" (Woolf, 1970, p. 202) of the pageant's
audience following their unification speaks to this loss of
vision. However, this loss was also a growing concern on
Woolf's part of the dangers associated with a highly unified
group. The rise of Nazism was a contemporary illustration of
the power of a collective mind that tolerated no differences
or deviations from its worldview. Anyone outside the group
of fascism became an object, an item subject to removal from
society and, ultimately, disposal. That Hitler used media
technology, a technology that earlier had brought Woolf so
much pleasure, must have been even more disturbing.
Woolf's use of the gramophone and its dynamism to illus-
trate the dangers of mediated sound as it penetrates ego
boundaries to create, shape, and manage human emotion
speaks to her anxiety. Galia Benziman (2006) has argued
that, ultimately, Woolf's last novel suggests that "[t]he self-
image is no longer that of `me' and `others' as separate, but
of a big, inclusive `we,' which, unlike the nationalistic or
totalitarian `we,' is not stable and monolithic but accommo-
dates difference" (p. 69). This seems an overly hopeful read-
ing of the text, for after the play ends, the individuality of the
audience members returns.
The most hopeful aspect of the novel's conclusion lies in
the final moments as Giles and Isa prepare to do emotional
battle. Isa is well-aware of Giles's infidelity, while he sus-
pects her desire to be unfaithful. Initially, "they were silent.
Alone, enmity was bared; also love. Before they slept, they
must fight; after they fought, they would embrace. From that
embrace another life might be born" (Woolf, 1970, p. 219).
While the gramophone's sounds effected the most widespread
and lasting intersubjectivity during the pageant, even the
words that Giles and Isa will speak in anger will have the
potential to penetrate the boundaries of their individual selves.
There is the potential for intersubjectivity, however briefly,
between the two that comes from the embodied voice rather
than the mediated directives of a machine. The greater hope is
the new life that might arise from this intersubjectivity. It may
be that this life is better equipped to accommodate differ-
ences, to exist uniquely even among an inclusive "we," and to
resist the dangers of thinking with the herd. That hope springs
to life in the inclusive final sentence of the novel: "They
spoke" (Woolf, 1970, p. 219). In the end, Woolf believes that
intersubjectivity comes from the embodied voice of the
human speaking directly to another.
Conclusion
Both H.D. and Woolf believed that art could unify people of
disparate social, cultural, and national backgrounds. Both
writers also understood that the dynamic and influential
nature of media technologies could create an intersubjectiv-
ity that challenged individual notions of the self, thus desta-
bilizing the privileged position of the subject. Although both
writers valued intersubjectivity, the rise of the National
Socialist Party to power in Germany and Hitler's use of
media technologies to encourage uniformity of thought sug-
gest that intersubjectivity might be as dangerous as extreme
individualism.
It is unclear how H.D.'s perception of film may have
changed with the rise of Nazism. After about 1930, her inter-
est in film--at least as expressed in her writing--seems to
have faded. Her last essay for Close Up was published in
1929, and her last essay about film was contained in the pam-
phlet Borderline, published in 1930. It is likely that the
advent of sound in film played a role in her shifting attention.
H.D. (1998b) writes at the end of the "Mask and the
Movietone" that "[t]here is something inside that the
Movietone would eventually . . . destroy, utterly, for many of
us" (p. 119). The object of destruction is the cinema as tem-
ple: "that half-world of lights and music and blurred percep-
tion" (H.D., 1998b, p. 119). The sound film might produce a
"`bottled' America" (H.D., 1998b, p. 117) that would
improve understanding between nations, but it also chal-
lenged the film image as a universal language, as well as the
shared experience of the audience in the half-light of the cin-
ema. Ultimately, her ambivalence toward both the introduc-
tion of sound to film and the loss of agency on the part of the
audience created a sense of distrust in machine-mediated
intersubjectivity so that her attention turned from the cinema
during the early 1930s back to poetry and prose as her pri-
mary means of artistic expression.
While H.D. believed that film failed as a means of achiev-
ing intersubjectivity, she did not believe that shared con-
sciousness or shared understanding were unachievable goals.
During the late 1930s, she became involved with the Mass-
Observation project. Georgina Taylor (2001) describes the
project as
committed to assembling the facts of everyday existence in this
period of crisis, an anthropology of ordinary lives carried out by
ordinary people. It sought to move away from a focus on
individual production and to remove a distinction between an
Hibbs 9
intellectual or artistic elite and the "masses" by gathering the
opinions of people from all classes and backgrounds and
documenting very ordinary lives. (p. 149)
Such a project must have appealed to H.D. and her desire to
find commonalities and understanding among people. As
war became inevitable and the hope of nations coming to
understand one another faded, H.D. placed her faith in the
people of Great Britain finding a point of intersubjectivity
through the Mass-Observation project, which she hoped
would "help break down these barriers that make eventually
for prejudice and at the last analysis for war" (as cited in
Taylor, 2001, p. 150). Germany and Great Britain might not
find common ground, but H.D. believed the people of Britain
could. Furthermore, she believed they could be united
through sharing responses and observations rather than
through the nationalist propaganda that had created such
patriotic fervor during the First World War. Intersubjectivity
was desirable but not at the expense of the individual's
thought, experience, or agency.
Woolf, by contrast, was less hopeful as she witnessed the
rise of German Nazism even as she drafted Between the Acts.
The exploitation of the aural--the sense Woolf privileged
most--to create the intersubjectivity required to grow the
National Socialist party to power must have troubled her
deeply. The exploitation of media technology informed her
last novel, as the intersubjectivity she had hoped to achieve
in her art is brought to fruition within the pages of Between
the Acts only to be shattered when the pageant's cast forces
the audience to look at themselves in the mirrors. But even
more damning is the manipulation of the audience during
their moments of intersubjectivity, for they become little
more than objects to be directed and managed, by a machine
no less. If inanimate objects can exercise such influence,
what then separates the human from the object? If intersub-
jectivity is stretched into Nazism, then what hope is there for
a common understanding that can overcome differences
while still respecting those differences? These are the ques-
tions Woolf poses in Between the Acts, and these are the
questions that for her are never resolved.
For both H.D. and Woolf, the promise of media technol-
ogy as the means of bridging differences and creating inter-
subjectivity falls far short of their expectations. As H.D.
(1998b) writes, "Too much mechanical perfection would
serve only I fear, to threaten that world of half light" (p. 120).
She is writing of the sound film's intrusion into her universal
language of image, but the mechanical perfection of which
she writes may well refer to the visual and aural media tech-
nologies themselves and their abilities to influence the
masses in numbers and ways that print media never could.
The half light of an intersubjectivity that acknowledges and
allows differences is threatened by the technologies that fill
the air waves and the cinemas with propaganda that tolerates
no variation in thought or ideology. The promise of "a per-
fect medium" is lost to a war machine.

Notes
1. Arjun Appadurai (1986) observes that believing objects to be
without agency is a relatively new paradigm, writing, "the
powerful contemporary tendency is to regard the world of
things as inert and mute, set in motion and animated, indeed
knowable only by persons and their words. Yet, in many his-
torical societies, things have not been so divorced from the
capacity of persons to act and the power of words to commu-
nicate" (p. 4).
2. The gramophone in Virginia Woolf's Between the Acts chuffs
exuberantly throughout the text, often "speaking" over the
actors in the pageant and interrupting conversations between
audience members.
3. Although tradition has it that Pound had already determined
the aesthetic vision of Imagism and recognized those quali-
ties in H.D.'s (Hilda Doolittle) work when he read her poetry
in tea room of the British Museum, Shari Benstock offers
an alternative reading of events in Women of the Left Bank:
Parish 1900-1940. Benstock (1986) suggests that "H.D.'s
poetry crystallized the Imagist conception for [Pound], pro-
viding a standard of poetic practice through which to define
the elements of the movement he wished to found" (p. 322).
Benstock (1986) further suggests that H.D. actually subverted
"Imagist principles in order to accommodate her own views"
and that "our traditional understanding of H.D.'s relation to
Imagism has not only misrepresented her poetic methods . . .
but may have also distorted our understanding of the uses she
made of Greek materials" (p. 327).
4. The belief in the universality of the image was informed, in
some part, by Sigmund Freud's thoughts about dreams. H.D.
(1974) in Tribute to Freud writes that "[Freud] had dared to
say . . . all nations and races met in the universal world of the
dream...its language, its imagery were common to the whole
race . . . The picture-writing, the hieroglyph of the dream, was
the common property of the whole race; in the dream, man, as
at the beginning of time, spoke a universal language" (p. 71).
5. For further discussion of film as hieroglyphics, see Miriam
Hansen's "Hieroglyphics, Figurations of Writing" in Babel
and Babylon.
6. The first, "The Cinema and the Classics I: Beauty," was pub-
lished in the inaugural volume of Close Up in July 1927. The
second essay, "The Cinema and the Classics II: Restraint,"
appeared in Issue 2, published in August 1927, while the
third, "The Cinema and the Classics III: The Mask and the
Movietone," appeared in Issue 5 in November 1927.
7. Pridmore-Brown (1998) also observes how the gramophone
serves "as a tool for controlling the audience gathered at Pointz
Hall. Through this device, Woolf explores fascism's empha-
sis on acoustic communication, its rootedness in the dramatic
orchestration of emotion" (p. 411).

8. Even as attention was given to the role of the aural, the sense
of self that might result if hearing was privileged was some-
what troubling. While the eye can be closed thus shutting off
visual perception, the ear has no such mechanism. Sounds
can permeate the body, so that "the nature of sounds decon-
structs the ego's sense of identity, its sense of itself as a sub-
stantial, self-grounded subjectivity, enjoying an undisputed
certainty in a world under its control" (Levin, 1989, p. 34).
The sense that one is a separate entity enjoying the boundar-
ies of a physical body is destabilized by sound. Thus, Steven
Connor (1997) observes, when hearing becomes the means
of self-definition and understanding, the self is "imaged
not as a point but as a membrane; not as a picture, but as
a channel through which voices, noises, and musics travel"
(p. 207). If bodies are membranes through which sound
travels, then intersubjectivity becomes the norm. The group
with its shared "voices, noises, and musics" should be then
privileged, and the divisive nature of individualism should be
minimized. Yet, the ability of sound to penetrate the body and
the inability of the ear to shut out sound has led to the audi-
tory being experienced "not as a principle of strength, but as
a disintegrative principle" (Connor, 1997, p. 213). When the
aural is privileged, the self that results is one of indistinct
boundaries, and intersubjectivity becomes a possibility, a
state of being that runs counter to the modern Western para-
digm of individuality.
9. In discussing the importance of listening in the development of
the self, Ihde (1976) observes that "within auditory experience
I find myself already within language" (p. 118), a language that
exists within as well as exterior to the individual. Ihde (1976)
adds, "Inner speech as the hidden monologue of thinking-in-
a-language accompanies the daily activities of humans even
when they are not speaking to each other. The voices of others
whom I hear immerse me in a language which has already pen-
etrated my innermost being in that I `hear' the speech which
I stand within" (p. 120). The inner or other voice then of the
pageant's audience is that of both themselves, the voices of
those they hear in their daily lives, and the resonances created
by the music long associated British strength and conquest.
