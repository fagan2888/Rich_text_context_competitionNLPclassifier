Minority Perspectives from the Health
and Retirement Study1
Editor's Note: The three symposia in this series are composed of articles based on
analyses of the Health and Retirement Study, F. Thomas Juster, Principal Investigator.
The articles were first presented as papers at the "Minority Perspectives in the Health
and Retirement Study Workshop," held May 26-27, 1995 at the Institute for Social
Research, the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The study is funded by a National
Institute of Aging Cooperative Agreement. Richard M. Suzman is Program Officer for
the study.
Introduction: Health and Retirement Among
Ethnic and Racial Minority Groups
James S. Jackson, PhD,2 Shirley A. Lockery, PhD,3 and F. Thomas Juster, PhD2
The purpose of the Minority Perspectives in the
Health and Retirement Study Workshop was to ex-
plore issues related to the health and related retire-
ment experiences of ethnic and racial minorities (Af-
rican Americans and Hispanic Americans). The goals
were to begin the empirical examination of the
Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data to stimulate
further thinking and empirical research as this his-
toric study of health and retirement processes con-
tinues over the next decade. This landmark prospec-
tive longitudinal panel study is one of the largest and
1As the general editors of this series of symposia, we would like to
acknowledge that our task was made considerably easier by the contribu-
tions of each of the section action .editors, Drs. Charlie Brown, Melissa
Hardy, and Robert Wallace. Our most difficult tasks were in conceiving of,
and assisting in, the execution of the Minority Perspectives in the Health and
Retirement Study Workshop. The Workshop would not have been possible
without the financial and moral support of Dr. Richard Suzman of the
National Institute on Aging, and the Health and Retirement Study project
staff. We are extremely appreciative of the work of Ms. Liza Chase, Ms. Kelly
Conlin, Ms. Dale Jerome, and Ms. Sally Oswald, whose hard work made the
Workshop a reality. We would also like to give a special thanks to Ms. Dale
Jerome, whose communications with the action editors and authors contrib-
uted to making the process proceed smoothly and efficiently.
Finally, we would like to acknowledge and thank Dr. Rose C. Gibson,
Editor-in-Chief of The Gerontologist, who provided direct support by work-
ing on and participating in the Workshop. Most importantly, she conceived
of the idea of submitting a set of papers from the Workshop to the peer
review process. Ten excellent papers have emerged out of this process.

most ambitious academic social science projects
ever undertaken to investigate health and retirement
processes (Juster & Suzman, 1995a, 1995b). In Wave
1, approximately 13,000 individuals born between
1931 and 1941 were interviewed, including oversam-
ples of more than 2,000 African Americans and nearly
1,200 Hispanics.
It was our expectation that this Workshop would be
just the first step in stimulating interest and research
on these issues among racial and ethnic minority
groups. While all older Americans are vulnerable to
harsh and unequal treatment, certain demographic
subgroups, ethnic and racial minorities, and women
provide stark examples of the types of problems faced
by all elderly. Members of the groups (women, mi-
norities, immigrants, etc.) that are especially vulnera-
ble will show the effects first, but ultimately, age-
related biases and discrimination will affect all older
individuals.
One of the more remarkable facts of the 20th
century has been the change in the quality of mate-
rial life for older Americans. Social Security, Medi-
care, Medicaid, the Older Americans' Act, and anti-
age discrimination legislation have produced major
improvements in the economic and social status of
the current generation of older Americans. The pov-
erty rate among older Americans has been reduced
by over 300%, and it is clear that the type of financial
security enjoyed by elders today is far greater than
282 The Gerontologist
that of their parents and grandparents. Thus, the
material, psychological, and social conditions of life
for older Americans has improved dramatically.
The unparalleled increase in the standard of living
for older Americans has not been enjoyed equally by
all. Significant inequalities in the material and non-
material resources in the lives of millions of older
Americans persist, and it is even growing among
some major demographic groups, especially ethnic
and racial minorities and women (Jackson, 1996).
Many ethnic and racial minority group elderly con-
tinue to lag behind whites in social and economic
status (Chen, 1994). Indicators of income, education,
and health status document the deprived position of
these groups relative to whites. For example, recent
reports (e.g., Bennett, 1992) on the circumstances of
blacks across the entire life course suggest that new
cohorts of elderly minorities will continue to experi-
ence relative disadvantage. While more than a third
of the black elderly continue to live below the pov-
erty level, we know that many black elderly people
are better fed, better housed, and in better health
than in earlier periods of time (Jackson, 1996). Most
of this improvement is because of the introduction of
government assistance programs that provide the
prime support for black Americans and many Latino
and American Indians in older age. A larger propor-
tion of ethnic minorities is heavily dependent upon
these government programs for subsistence in older
age due to histories of poor occupational opportuni-
ties and lack of wealth and private retirement funds.
Recent cutbacks of federal programs, a change in
the economy favoring job creation in highly special-
ized, technologically sophisticated, and education-
ally intensive sectors of the economy, global eco-
nomic competitiveness, and simultaneous growth in
low-paying service positions provide few opportuni-
ties for many of today's minority young adult and
middle-aged cohorts. It is foreseeable that without
significant policy interventions, future cohorts of
older blacks and other racial and ethnic minorities of
color will not be as well off as their white counter-
parts, and it is unlikely that they will maintain the
material living standards of current minority elders
(Jackson, 1996; Stanford & Torres-Gill, 1991; Wil-
liams & Collins, 1995).
Continuing research points to the negative differ-
entials in health status and health services among
whites and groups of color (Jackson & Perry, 1989;
Jackson, Antonucci, & Gibson, 1990; Wykle & Kaskel,
1994). At this point, the exact differences in the struc-
ture of health, the processes of health, and the influ-
ences of service use and health problems experi-
enced among ethnic minority elders remains unclear
(Gibson, 1994; Jackson, 1996). What is clear, how-
ever, is that ethnic and racial minorities suffer poorer
health status at each point of the life course and are
more likely than majority group elders to develop
debilitating chronic health conditions and suffer dis-
abilities in older ages (Wykle & Kaskel, 1994).
Very little empirical research had been devoted to
the study of work and retirement in ethnic and racial
minorities (Jackson & Gibson, 1985; Gibson, 1991b;
Allen & Chin-Sang, 1990; Zsembik & Singer, 1990).
Some earlier work speculated that the entire retire-
ment process, viewed within a life-span context, may
be very different for blacks and other discriminated
against groups (Jackson & Gibson, 1985). Many racial
minorities, because of long histories of dead-end
jobs with poor benefits, have few retirement support
opportunities in the traditional sense; inadequate
income, poor housing, and uncertain futures greet
these groups at retirement age (Chen, 1994). Faced
with limited retirement resources, many ethnic mi-
norities may out of necessity continue working past
customary retirement ages, even when they are in
poor health (Gibson & Burns, 1991). In fact, some
research indicates that these individuals are physi-
cally, psychologically, and socially worse off than
their retired counterparts (Jackson, 1996; Gibson,
1991a). Even the relatively poor but stable govern-
ment retirement benefits many groups receive may
be better than sporadic and poor jobs in the regular
labor market (Chen, 1994).
New national data collection efforts, like the
Health and Retirement Study, are improving the
quality and quantity of available data on the aging
experience of African American and other racial and
ethnic minority Americans. While we can always ask
for more and better data, especially data based upon
longitudinal and cross-sequential designs (Jackson,
1996), the improvement in a few short years has been
impressive. Similarly, the approach to research on
minority elderly has also shown greater recognition
of the heterogeneity among ethnic minority elders
(J. J. Jackson, 1985). Research like the HRS is now
more focused on the role of culture, socioeconomic
status, and gender as important markers of potential
process differences, especially health and retire-
ment, within and among aging groups of color. Re-
cent research studies like the HRS are reversing his-
torical trends of poor data quantity and quality, and
generalizable findings are beginning to emerge con-
cerning health, work, and retirement for elderly
groups of color.
The HRS is not perfect. Adequate samples of non-
black and non-Mexican American ethnic and racial
groups are not available in the study. Greater empha-
sis is needed in the future on social, psychological,
and cultural factors, which play important mediating
roles in health and retirement outcomes among
groups of color (Jackson, Antonucci, & Gibson,
1995). Nevertheless, we believe that the articles in
this issue of The Gerontologist demonstrate the high
quality of empirical social science research that is
possible when quality data are available on health
and retirement processes among nationally repre-
sentative samples of ethnic and racial minorities. We
are sure that you will agree.
