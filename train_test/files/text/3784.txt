Abstract
Objective: To identify the factors that influenced the risk of injury-related disability caused by the
Wenchuan earthquake.
Methods: A chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID) classification tree analysis was
used to retrospectively analyse clinical data from patients who underwent surgical treatment for
earthquake-related injuries in the first 5 days after the earthquake. The CHAID classification tree
explored the relationships between the development of disability and potential influencing factors
including sex, age, time interval between injury and treatment, wound type, preoperative and
postoperative haemoglobin levels, and operation time.
Results: A total of 334 patients underwent surgery; of these, 113 (33.8%) were discharged
with varying degrees of permanent disability. The CHAID classification tree showed that children
(17 years old), a long time interval between injury and treatment, an open wound and a low
preoperative haemoglobin level were significant risk factors for disability.
Conclusion: The results of this study can help to stratify patients according to their medical needs
and to help allocate the available resources efficiently to ensure the best outcomes for injured
patients during future earthquakes.

Introduction
An earthquake is a natural disaster with
strong destructive power that can cause a
tremendous amount of personal injuries and
property loss due to its unpredictability. On
12 May 2008, an earthquake, graded 8.0 on
the Richter Scale, occurred with an epicentre
located at the township of Wenchuan,
Sichuan Province, China. The death toll
and those declared missing exceeded 80,000
and about 400,000 individuals were injured.1
The epidemiology of mortality and injury
means that earthquakes can be differen-
tiated from other natural hazards,2 such as
hurricanes and Food emergencies. Floods
and hurricanes typically cause many deaths
due to drowning but few serious medical or
surgical injuries. By comparison, earth-
quakes not only cause many deaths initially,
but also many severe injuries including
fracture cases, head injuries, thoracic inju-
ries and abdominal injuries,3­5 requiring
complex surgical and resuscitative medical
care. Many injuries will be severe enough to
lead to long-term functional impairment
and disability. Examples include spinal
cord injuries, fractures that develop compli-
cations such as infection or alignment prob-
lems, and crush injuries of the extremities
requiring amputation.6 Physical disability is
an enormous psychological and financial
burden on the population in terms of
resources.
Various clinical factors may be related to
injury-related disability. For example, an
injured person with an open wound may
have serious internal and external bleeding.
In addition, since the protection of the skin
has been penetrated, the wound is easily
contaminated and may become infected.
If the contaminated wound is not cleaned
in a timely and effective manner, this in turn
may lead to long-term disability.7 Therefore,
appropriate medical and surgical treatment
for these injuries is vital to minimize future
functional impairment and disability.8
It remains unclear what the important
factors are that may affect the risk of injury-
related disability following an earthquake.
To understand the significance of the poten-
tial factors and to determine their relation-
ships with injury-related disability, this
current study used a chi-squared automatic
interaction detection (CHAID) classifica-
tion tree analysis to evaluate the factors
identified following the Wenchuan earth-
quake. In this way, injured patients who are
at a high risk of injury-related disability can
be readily identified in order to aid in the
provision of adequate surgical resources and
to develop guidelines for the effective treat-
ment of injured patients during future
earthquakes.
Patients and methods
Patient population
The West China Hospital of Sichuan
University, Chengdu, China, the largest
hospital in China, is only 80 miles (130 km)
south-east of the epicentre of the Wenchuan
earthquake. Therefore, it naturally assumed
the role of a first-line major rescue centre
and received the most seriously wounded
patients.
This study was a retrospective review
of patients injured in the Wenchuan
earthquake, triaged to the Department of
Emergency Medicine, West China Hospital,
who underwent surgical treatment during
the first 5 days after the earthquake between
488 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
14:28 hours on 12 May 2008 and 23:59 hours
on 16 May 2008 and were subsequently
discharged. The exclusion criteria were: (i)
patients without complete medical records;
(ii) patients treated in the emergency room
and released; (iii) patients who underwent
surgery during the study period for reasons
not related to the earthquake. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board
of West China Hospital. Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants.
Routine blood tests, coagulation profiles
and necessary imaging procedures were
undertaken before surgery. Packed red
blood cells were transfused perioperatively
when the patient's haemoglobin levels were
<80.0 g/l. Fresh frozen plasma and platelets
were also transfused according to clinical
need.
All of the following data were retrieved
from each patient's medical records: sex,
age, admission time, injured site, wound
type, preoperative haemoglobin level, post-
operative haemoglobin level, blood transfu-
sion data, surgery performed, operation
time, discharge time and surgical outcome
(recovery and disability). Any of the follow-
ing conditions were considered to be a
disability: (i) paraplegia; (ii) limb loss; (iii)
joint injury with subsequent postoperative
significant movement disturbance; (iv) any
postoperative visually apparent movement
disturbance.
Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistical analysis was used to
summarize demographic characteristics and
data on the injured site, wound type and
surgical outcome. All statistical analyses
were performed using the SPSSÕ statistical
package, version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA) for WindowsÕ. A CHAID model
was used to analyse the relationships
between disability and potential influencing
factors. CHAID is a type of classification
tree technique that is currently used in data
mining and machine learning.9,10 The ana-
lysis proceeds in a stepwise fashion in which
the most significant predictor (the largest 2)
is used to partition the entire sample into
two or more mutually exclusive subgroups.
As in the first step, the cases in a given
subgroup are further partitioned by the next
most significant predictor of the original
outcome. The analysis continues in this
manner until there are no more significant
predictors.11 A P-value  0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
During the first 5 days after the earthquake,
334 patients were admitted to hospital and
underwent surgical treatment for earth-
quake-related injuries. Of the 334 patients,
166 (49.7%) were male. The mean age of the
patient population was 38.1 (range 1­87)
years. A total of 228 (68.3%) patients suf-
fered from open wounds and 106 (31.7%)
patients had closed wounds. Of the 334
patients, 221 patients (66.2%) were dis-
charged without disability, and 113 patients
(33.8%) were discharged with varying
degrees of permanent disability.
Figure 1 presents the proportion of
patients according to the major site of
injury. The most common major site
of injury was the lower limbs, followed by
the upper limbs, spine, head, abdomen, face
and neck, pelvis and chest.
The CHAID classification tree analysis
showed that all participants were initially
split based on the wound type; hence, wound
type was the most important influencing
factor with regard to the subsequent devel-
opment of disability (Figure 2). Patients
with an open wound were at a higher risk
of disability than those patients with closed
wounds. Preoperative haemoglobin level
was another important influencing factor,
particularly when the haemoglobin level was
very low. When preoperative haemoglobin
was <86.0 g/l (node 3), 68.6% of the patients
Liu et al. 489
developed disability. The time interval
between injury and treatment was also an
important variable for the development of
disability. When the time interval was
<21.6 h (node 10), few patients (4.8%)
became disabled, but if the time interval
was >54.7 h (node 12), nearly half of the
patients (48.6%) became disabled. The
CHAID classification tree also showed that
children (17 years) were more likely to
suffer from disability than adults. As nodes 8
and 9 showed, when the preoperative
haemoglobin level was between 86.0 g/l and
107.0 g/l, the rate of the disability in children
was nearly twice as high as in adults (59.1%
versus 33.3%, respectively).
Discussion
The CHAID classification tree analysis
undertaken in this current study demon-
strated that patients with open wounds were
at a relatively high risk of disability: (i) when
their preoperative haemoglobin level was
very low (<86.0 g/l); (ii) when the haemo-
globin level of was low (86.0 g/l ­ 107.0 g/l)
in children (17 years); and (iii) when their
haemoglobin level was not low (>107.0 g/l),
but when the time interval between injury
and treatment was long (>54.7 h).
The warning period for onset of an
earthquake is limited, so it is hard to com-
pletely avoid injuries and loss of life.12

treated by surgical procedures, poor results,
especially disabilities, are often reported
after earthquakes.13­16 However, it remains
unclear what the important factors are that
may affect the risk of developing injury-
related disability. Identification of these
influencing factors is needed to improve
the management of earthquake-related inju-
ries and reduce disabilities. This is of par-
ticular concern in developing countries,
especially in Asia where most earthquakes
strike densely populated areas.17
A devastating earthquake may cause
massive destruction of roads and basic
facilities, so victims often fail to have
access to timely and effective medical atten-
tion, which may further exacerbate their
injuries. In this present study, the interval
between injury time and treatment time were
closely related to clinical outcome. When the
time interval was >2 days, the rate of
disability was much higher than when the
time interval was <1 day. This indicates that
treatment delay is associated with a higher
risk of disability. Therefore, timely emer-
gency treatment of the critically injured
patient is essential to reduce disabilities.18
Wound type was identified as the
most important influencing factor for pre-
dicting disability in this present study.
Injured patients with open wounds were
more likely to become disabled than those
with closed wounds. The reason may be that
the injured patient with an open wound has
the potential for the development of serious
bacterial wound infections and tissue necro-
sis, which would contribute to the disabil-
ity.19 In the Department of Laboratory
Medicine of West China Hospital, Gram-
negative bacilli were cultured from 71.3%
and Gram-positive bacilli were cultured
from 18.9% of the open wounds.20 This

Liu et al. 491
indicates that injured patients should first be
treated with preliminary wound debride-
ment in the earthquake field, and then sent
to hospital for further treatment. This strat-
egy may help to prevent future disability.
In this present study, patients with a
lower preoperative haemoglobin level were
at a higher risk of disability, especially for
patients with an open wound and a haemo-
globin level <86.0 g/l. This indicates that
injuries related to internal and external
bleeding have an important influence on
patient recovery. Excessive bleeding has in
some cases been reported to result in death
or permanent disability.21 The reason might
also be that excessive bleeding might weaken
the immune system, which may exacerbate
wound infection.22 Another reason is that
lower haemoglobin levels decrease the
oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, redu-
cing tissue oxygenation. In this hypoxic
state, patients might suffer from tissue
necrosis leading to permanent disability.23
Therefore, control of bleeding is necessary
for proper wound management.
These current results also suggest that
children were more likely to develop disabil-
ity after an earthquake, which was consist-
ent with a previous study.24 Because of their
limited ability to react to emergencies and
their weaker physical resistance, children
were easily buried underneath collapsible
debris, which exacerbated their injuries,
making them too severe and complex to
fully recover from. It has been reported that
very young children have a relatively lower
resilience to injury and a lower ability to
take proactive actions to cope with post-
disaster conditions.25 For this vulnerable
population, timely treatment and special
medical care should be provided. In terms
of injury prevention measures, this may
reflect the fact that at the time of an
earthquake, children usually do not have
enough knowledge to seek safe places to
shelter. Future education for school-age
children regarding basic safety behaviour
during an earthquake may reduce the like-
lihood of disability within this group.
In conclusion, the present study used a
CHAID classification tree analysis to com-
prehensively explore the influencing factors
for the development of disability among
patients injured in an earthquake, and it
identified those patient groups that are at a
high risk of developing permanent disability.
In terms of available medical resources and
the likelihood of providing timely treatment
for large numbers of injured patients, this
study can help to stratify patients according
to their medical needs, and to help allocate
resources in a manner ensuring the greatest
health benefit for the greatest number of
injured patients.
