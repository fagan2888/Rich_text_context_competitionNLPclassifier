Over the past 25 years, the international and scientific com-
munity has repeatedly attempted to deal with the issue of
sustainability. "Our Common Future" (United Nations [UN],
1987), commonly known as the "Brundtland Report," argues
that sustainable development should meet "the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of future genera-
tions to meet their own needs." It stresses the necessity to
implement economic, social, environmental, and institu-
tional progress that can be maintained over time. Worldwide
concerns about sustainable development are also reflected in
the global food security debate, which states that "food secu-
rity exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social
and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food
which meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an
active and healthy life" (Food and Agriculture Organization
[FAO], 1996). The 1996 World Food Summit (WFS) identi-
fies four main determinants of food security: food availabil-
ity, accessibility to food, food utilization, and the stability
over time of the three previous dimensions; depletion in any
one of these leads to food insecurity.
The first crucial change from the supply-based food secu-
rity concept of 1974 (UN, 1975) came with the access-related
definition of food security (FAO, 1983; World Bank, 1986)
using Sen's entitlements approach (Sen, 1981). Then, the
nutrition approach guided the notion of utilization (Staatz,
D'Agostino, & Sundberg, 1990), highlighting the need for
quality, including good and culturally accepted feeding
practices, food safety, and nutritional value. During the same
period, Maxwell and Smith (1992) sustain the theory that
household access to sufficient and nutritious food at all times
is key to food security. Building on the 1986 World Bank
report "Poverty and Hunger," the stability dimension, related
to the temporal dynamics of food insecurity, was explicitly
acknowledged.
Associating sustainable agriculture and food security,
Speth (1993) suggests orientating development strategies
toward the combined socioeconomic-environment goal of
sustainable food security.
Sustainable food security is actually the concept under-
pinning the 1996 definition of the WFS where environmental
and social issues were further stressed, especially for cli-
matic risks, water availability, biodiversity losses, and
cultural food preferences. The term sustainable food security

Sustainability and Food & Nutrition
Security: A Vulnerability Assessment
Framework for the Mediterranean Region
Paolo Prosperi1,2,3, Thomas Allen4, Martine Padilla1, Iuri Peri2,
and Bruce Cogill5
Abstract
Recurrent food crises and climate change, along with habitat loss and micronutrient deficiencies, are global issues of critical
importance that have pushed food security and environmental sustainability to the top of the political agenda. Analyses of
the dynamic linkages between food consumption patterns and environmental concerns have recently received considerable
attention from the international and scientific community. Using the lens of a broad sustainability approach, this conceptual
article aims at developing a multidimensional framework to evaluate the sustainability of food systems and diets, applicable
to countries of the Mediterranean region. Derived from natural disaster and sustainability sciences, a vulnerability approach,
enhanced by inputs from the resilience literature, has been adapted to analyze the main issues related to food and nutrition
security. Through causal factor analysis, the resulting conceptual framework improves the design of information systems or
metrics assessing the interrelated environmental, economic, social, and health dynamics of food systems.

was already coined in March 1987 in the Brundtland Report.
Yet in 1983, Swaminathan (1983) was among the first to
point out the need for an ecological foundation to food secu-
rity "to protect basic life-support systems of land, water,
flora, fauna, and the atmosphere" (p. 37). In 1987,
Swaminathan reaffirmed the sustainable food security con-
cept, extending it to encompass both nutritional and water
issues, while Gussow and Clancy (1986) were the first to use
the term sustainable diets to define diets both healthy for the
environment and humans.
The multiple interconnected dimensions of these two con-
cerns--sustainable development and food & nutrition secu-
rity--open new avenues for multidisciplinary research, as
demonstrated by the emerging literature on the topic and the
more recent related global events. The main conceptual out-
come of the 2010 International Scientific Symposium on
Biodiversity and Sustainable Diets is the definition of sus-
tainable diets as
those diets with low environmental impacts which contribute to
food and nutrition security and to a healthy life for present and
future generations. Sustainable diets are protective and respectful
of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible,
economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe
and healthy while optimizing natural human resources. (FAO &
Bioversity International, 2012, p. 7)
It is clear from this definition that the issue of sustainabil-
ity of diets closely refers to food and nutrition security. The
sustainable diets definition establishes four main goals for
the governance of a future sustainable food system: human
health and nutrition, cultural acceptability, economic viabil-
ity, and environmental protection (Fanzo, Cogill, & Mattei,
2012). It highlights some crucial elements such as the impor-
tance of biodiversity stocks not just for the agriculture and
the environment but also for adequacy to nutritional recom-
mendations and cultural acceptability. The multiple condi-
tions of sustainability clearly encompass several dimensions.
These conditions refer to different sets of capital that allow
flows of services to be maintained over time. Stiglitz, Sen,
and Fitoussi (2009) suggest that these welfare-producing ser-
vices can be sustained over time when stocks of capital (nat-
ural, physical, human, and social) are transferred to future
generations.
The analysis of the sustainability of food security requires
a shift toward a multidimensional vision (Pinstrup-Andersen,
2009), but also a transversal approach across the multiple
activities leading to diets. Achieving both sustainability and
food security requires more than focusing on agriculture or
on markets or on household food baskets, but to look at the
overall food system (Ingram, 2011). Sustainable food sys-
tems are key for assuring sustainable food security (FAO &
Bioversity International, 2012), and they cannot be pursued
in the absence of food and nutrition security (Buttriss &
Riley, 2013). Food security and food system sustainability
are then indispensable prerequisites to each other, and they
need to be jointly analyzed.
Policymakers and stakeholders play a key role in the gov-
ernance of future sustainable food systems, at a different spa-
tial scale. They need evidence-based scientific information
to define policy and implement actions (Barrett, 2010). The
aim of this article is to develop a conceptual framework,
applied to the Mediterranean region, which links concepts,
methods, and metrics, for a multidimensional joint analysis
of food and nutrition security and food system sustainability.
Building on the resilience literature, the vulnerability
approach (Turner et al., 2003) provides a systemic causal
pathway to analyze the impacts of the main drivers of change
on specific food security and nutrition outcomes. It allows
understanding and assessing the conditions of sustainability
of the food system. This article provides the conceptual
background to develop metrics, relying on evidence-based
scientific knowledge, to inform all stakeholders, particularly
policymakers, on response interventions to major changes at
national and regional scale, to maintain the ability of the sys-
tem to provide food security and good nutrition over time,
while taking into account environmental, social, and eco-
nomic constraints and assets.
We first introduce the Mediterranean context and briefly
review the main issues related to food and nutrition security
and food system sustainability in the region. Developed from
natural disaster and sustainability sciences, the vulnerability
conceptual framework is presented as a valid approach to
capture and model food system sustainability. We then
expose the associated metrics--or information system--to
quantify vulnerability that integrates three essential compo-
nents: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity (Turner et
al., 2003). We finally discuss the utility of this approach with
examples of its possible application to Mediterranean
countries.
Food Insecurity and Environmental
Unsustainability: A Joint Regional
Analysis
Changes in Dietary Patterns and Food Insecurity
Globally, more than 2 billion people are food insecure, either
undernourished, malnourished, or overnourished (FAO,
World Food Programme [WFP], & International Fund for
Agricultural Development [IFAD], 2012; Strang, 2009;
World Health Organization [WHO], 2013). Concurrently,
there is a consensus among the international and scientific
community on the non-sustainability of the western agrofood
system, in terms of its impacts on natural resources and eco-
systems, and on human health with increasing prevalence of
non-communicable diet-related diseases. The Mediterranean
region has been identified as one of the main critical hotspots
of environmental unsustainability due to intense human
activity and agricultural exploitation (Capone, Lamaddalena,
Prosperi et al. 3
Lamberti, Elferchichi, & El Bilali, 2012; Salvati, 2014). A
large part of its population can also be considered food inse-
cure. Using UN anthropometric and population composition
data,1 out of a total population of about 500 million, it is pos-
sible to estimate that at least 215 million adults and children
(44% of total population) are "qualitative and quantitative
food-insecure" in the Mediterranean region.2,3 The geo-
graphical zone represents an interesting testing area of study
in which to carry out a multidimensional analysis of the
interconnected factors that characterize food insecurity and
environmental unsustainability. In this section, we present a
joint analysis of the current situation and show how both
issues intersect.
On the supply side, all the dietary energy supplies (DES)
of the Mediterranean countries4 largely exceed the average
dietary energy requirements. At the same time, the majority
of these countries are strongly dependent on imports, espe-
cially for cereals (except France and Turkey). Furthermore,
the share of DES derived from cereals is still considerably
high (Egypt 65%, Morocco 57%, Algeria 55%, Tunisia 51%,
Libya 49%, Turkey 48%; Food and Agriculture Organization
Corporate Statistical Database [FAOSTAT] 2009, data avail-
able in November 2013).5 This cereal-centered dependency
can lead to a regional and national vulnerability. In particu-
lar, it occurs at the expense of middle- and low-income
groups, and of the national government expenditure. For
example, bread subsidies, amounting to US$2.5 billion per
year, were introduced in Egypt in 2008 (FAO, WFP, & IFAD,
2012). It is also necessary to consider food price volatility, in
particular for cereals, as it affects consumers' capabilities to
access food. Other related socioeconomic factors also deter-
mine access to food, such as adult literacy, which is still low
in some countries (Libya 89%, Algeria 73%, Egypt 72%,
Morocco 56%; United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization [UNESCO], data available in
November 2013). As for the utilization dimension of food
security, nutritional value and food safety remain critical
issues. Infant mortality (Morocco 28, Algeria 26, Egypt
18, Tunisia 14, Albania 13, Turkey 12), child stunt-
ing (Egypt 31%, Syria 27%, Albania 23%, Morocco 23%,
Libya 21%, Algeria 16%, Tunisia 9%), wasting (Morocco
11%, Syria 11%, Albania 9%, Egypt 8%, Libya 6%, Algeria
4%, Tunisia 3%), and underweight (Morocco 10%, Syria
10%, Egypt 7%, Albania 6%, Libya 6%, Algeria 4%, Tunisia
3%) are still considerably high (WHO, data available in
November 2013). In addition to this, obesity and overweight
are growing problems common to all the Mediterranean
countries, both for adults and for children. This double bur-
den of malnutrition is manifest in Egypt with prevalence
rates of 33% in adult obesity and 20% for child overweight,
against 31% for child stunting. Overweight and obesity are
also risk factors in cardiovascular diseases, which contribute
to 42% of all deaths in the Mediterranean (Rastoin & Cheriet,
2010).
Obesity is closely linked to dietary behavior and socio-
economic determinants but also to agricultural policies, pro-
duction systems, and food chain characteristics (Delpeuch,
Maire, Monnier, & Holdsworth, 2009). In the Northern
Mediterranean countries, these diet-related pathologies are
the symptoms of an overconsumption of meat (especially red
meat), dairy products, and eggs (Padilla, 2008), with a ten-
dency toward overconsumption of energy-rich and nutrient-
poor foods (Darmon & Soler, 2013). In Southern
Mediterranean, the double burden phenomenon represents
the chronic phase of a nutrition transition. Statistics show a
change of diet toward a regime that is richer in animal pro-
teins and fats, at the expense of dietary diversity and food
providing important micronutrients (Popkin, 2003). At the
same time, supply shortage and struggle for access to food
remain persistent for large cohorts of individuals. Another
feature of the nutrition transition in the Southern
Mediterranean countries is the change in the share of energy
sources derived from added sugars, with increased intake of
simple carbohydrates and refined sugars (Drewnowski &
Popkin, 1997) and, in particular, a sharp increase in levels of
simple sugar consumption through processed industrial
products (drinks, biscuits, desserts, etc.; Padilla, 2008).
Hence, nutrition transition and malconsumption6 are the
two major food phenomena leading to diet-related diseases
in the Mediterranean. Nutrient-poor "pseudo foods" (Winson,
2004) with high levels of vegetable oils, animal fats, sugar,
and salt permeate the global food system (Popkin, 2005).
Long-established dietary patterns and traditions using local
staples are being replaced with western-style highly pro-
cessed products (Pingali, 2007). This is the case in emerging
economies that are experiencing several phenomena simulta-
neously, such as increased urbanization, household income
growth, greater market penetration by foreign brands, global
supermarket and food service chains, expansion of advertis-
ing and mass media, and highly competitive prices (Sage,
2013). These dynamics lead to qualitative changes in diets
and thus new food security issues, together with changes in
lifestyle and work environment, with a growing tendency
toward sedentary jobs and physical activity increasingly
being limited to leisure time (Gil, Gracia, & Pérez, 1995).
These changes in diets contribute, as causal factors, to the
rising incidence of nutrition-related non-communicable dis-
eases, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and obesity.
The Associated Issue of Environmental
Unsustainability
These dietary changes and the increasing incidence of related
diseases coincide with major transformations in the agricul-
tural and food systems, which have become more global and
complex. These evolutions in food behavior patterns and in
industrial production and processing have joint social, eco-
nomic, and environmental impacts. It is a fact that
4 SAGE Open
the nutritional characteristics of diets are directly related to
environmental conditions, which are consequences of the
production system associated with current food consumption
patterns. The question is to understand to which extent. The
environmental impact of the current agrofood system is a
widely debated question. Darmon and Soler (2013), for
instance, observe a positive correlation between calorie
intake and greenhouse gas emissions. In any case, it should
be noted that the Mediterranean agrofood sector represents
25% of the global Ecological Footprint of the region (Global
Footprint Network, 2012).
The current shift from diverse farming systems to eco-
logically simplified ones, mainly based on cereals, contrib-
utes to micronutrient deficiency, poorly diversified diets, and
thus malnutrition in developed, as well as in developing
countries (Frison, Smith, Johns, Cherfas, & Eyzaguirre,
2006; Graham et al., 2007; Negin, Remans, Karuti, & Fanzo,
2009; Remans et al., 2011; Welch & Graham, 1999). An
important negative outcome of intensive production, in addi-
tion to environmental damage such as soil depletion and ero-
sion, and pollution of surface and groundwater, is the
narrowing of biodiversity base through the use of only the
most profitable varieties. Many of the processes and much of
the equipment used in the food industry have been developed
to transform staple foods with specific characteristics (e.g.,
size, color group, quality category, etc.). As a consequence,
despite an apparent diversity of the final products available
on the market for consumers, genetic resources diversity
tends to shrink. Current industrial production systems favor
limited varieties and monocultures to the disadvantage of
biological diversity (Esnouf, Russel, & Bricas, 2013). The
issue of biodiversity loss is related both to environmental
concerns and to health and nutrition issues, because of its
link with insufficient diet diversity, micronutrient deficiency,
and unhealthy food habits (Burlingame, Charrondiere, &
Mouille, 2009). The importance of food variety and compo-
sition, especially in terms of genetic resources, is increas-
ingly acknowledged. Differences in nutrients between
varieties have a major impact on nutrient intakes; higher con-
sumption of one variety over another can lead to adequacy or
deficiency in certain micronutrients. For this reason, nutri-
tion research looks at both the food composition and con-
sumption dimensions (Burlingame et al., 2009). The alarming
rate of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation, and the
consequent negative impact on food and nutrition security,
also provide strong reasons to reconsider the food systems
and diet approaches. It is necessary to develop and promote
strategies for sustainable food regimes, emphasizing the pos-
itive role of biodiversity to reverse or mitigate the phenom-
ena that cogenerate negative effects on human nutrition and
health (Burlingame, Charrondiere, Dernini, Stadlmayr, &
Mondovì, 2012). However, measuring food and nutritional
biodiversity is a difficult task; the International Network of
Food Data Systems (INFOODS) network developed metrics
that need a large amount of data, which are difficult to
collect.
The environment throughout the entire geographic area of
the Mediterranean is at risk, threatened by the intensive
exploitation of its natural resources, particularly water
(Lutter & Schnepf, 2011; Roson & Sartori, 2010; United
Nations Environment Programme­Plan Bleu, 2006).
Considering the increasing issue of drought in the region, the
intensification of water requirements for food is a major con-
cern (Capone et al., 2012). The high water demand of the
Mediterranean food system reveals a deficit in terms of vir-
tual water exchange for agrofood products (Mekonnen &
Hoekstra, 2011).7 Water consumption trends are directly
related to food consumption patterns as food products bring
with them an internal quantity of water that differs by food-
stuff origin, quality, and quantity. Water requirements for
plant and animal products vary widely. Red meat and dairy
products, for example, are considered highly water-consum-
ing compared with crop production. Thus, the quantity and
types of food demanded strongly implicate the extent of
water allocated and used for agriculture and related produc-
tion activities (Lundqvist, de Fraiture, & Molden, 2008).
Water consumption is therefore also connected to nutritional
composition of food consumed and strictly related to life
habits and to drivers of change affecting the food system.
The relationship between unhealthy foods and highly
environment-impacting foodstuff is tentatively captured by
the Barilla Center's Double Pyramid (Barilla Center for
Food and Nutrition, 2010). Some argue that the more fre-
quently recommended healthy food corresponds also to low-
est environment-impacting products and vice versa.
Consumption of red meat is, for example, often considered
the heaviest variable affecting the sustainability of food sys-
tems and consumed in excessive amounts in developed
countries (FAO, 2006; Lang, Dibb, & Reddy, 2011).
However, evidence is mixed with regard to the general align-
ment of environmental and nutritional recommendations.
For instance, Vieux, Darmon, Touazi, and Soler (2012) show
that high nutritional quality is not always associated with low
greenhouse gas emissions. Certainly no single food can
encompass the wide range of both nutritional and environ-
mental recommendations, without even mentioning eco-
nomic viability and social acceptability constraints.Amyriad
of factors affecting both actors and activities within the food
system explain the nutritional and environmental outcomes
of dietary behaviors. Providing a clearer picture of the circu-
lar dynamics between environmental, health, economic, and
social drivers can help not only to measure impacts or prog-
ress but also to understand interactions, and thus aid decision
making. We suggest tackling this complex challenge by
applying the vulnerability framework to the changes affect-
ing the agrofood system.
Building on Ingram (2011), we defend an approach to met-
rics, which switches not only from the "what we get" (food
security outcome approach) to the "what we do" approach
(food systems-activities approach; p. 419), but which also
considers the "what happens" side (food system­drivers
interactions). The Mediterranean region presents several
Prosperi et al. 5
factors of change affecting food security and environmental
sustainability. The multiple issues related to food insecurity
and unsustainability that have been exposed above for the
Mediterranean region can be analyzed from a multidimen-
sional perspective, as a series of issues or hotspots of vulner-
ability of the different national agrofood systems, and
integrated within a conceptual framework linking concepts,
methods, and metrics.
Vulnerability for a Multidimensional
and Dynamic System Approach
Mechanics of Change and Sustainability
According to the definition of agro-ecosystem sustainability
coined by Conway (1985), "Sustainability is the ability of a
system to maintain productivity in spite of a major distur-
bance, such as caused by intensive stress or a large perturba-
tion" (p. 35). Consistently with the literal English usage of
the verb "to sustain," Hansen (1996) further interprets sus-
tainability as a system's ability to continue through time. If
sustainability is the dynamic ability of a given system to
maintain or enhance its essential outcomes over time and
space, then the concept of vulnerability can provide the ele-
ments to understand the mechanisms affecting the activities
of the system (Turner et al., 2003).
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP­
Disaster Management Training Program, 1994) defines vul-
nerability as the "degree of loss to each element should a
hazard of a given severity occur" (p. 49), that is, the extent to
which an individual or system or geographic area is damaged
in relation to a given change. Downing (1990) states that
"vulnerability is the composite of two prospects: risk of
exposure and risk (or magnitude) of consequence" (p. 11).
The exposure to hazardous events is different from the mag-
nitude of the consequences that result from that exposure.
The vulnerability approach further evolves with Turner et al.
(2003), who established three main components to vulnera-
bility: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.
Adaptive--or copying--capacity corresponds to the
responses that it is possible to implement. The theoretical
basis for this evolution is to be found essentially in the theory
of abilities and capabilities (Sen, 1981).
The vulnerability assessment is today widely acknowl-
edged as composed of three dimensions (Adger, 2000, 2006;
Adger & Vincent, 2005; Allison et al., 2009; Cinner et al.,
2012; Gallopín, 2006; Grafton, 2010; Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change [IPCC], 2001; Kelly & Adger,
2000; Smit & Wandel, 2006): exposure and sensitivity to
single or multiple stressors, and the adaptive capacity to cope
with these. Hughes et al. (2012) adopted such a conceptual
framework to quantify the anthropic effects on coral reefs
and national food security, developing a national-level vul-
nerability index. In the case of the fresh fruit and vegetable
value chains, the vulnerability approach was adopted to
assess the strengths and weaknesses of Mediterranean pro-
duction zones facing an increasing competition from South
East Mediterranean countries (Rastoin, Ayadi, & Montigaud,
2007). The aim was to build an interregional diagnostic com-
parison by means of a Regional Vulnerability Index (RVI).
Vulnerability is a relative measure, and the exposure of
individuals/systems/regions is related to their specific condi-
tions. Similarly, the magnitude of the consequences from this
exposure is linked to these particular characteristics and their
associated sensitivity. Most adaptive capacity analyses tend
to be specific to a place and context while linked across
scales (Turner et al., 2003), and vulnerability is most fre-
quently assessed at national levels (Allison et al., 2009;
Brooks, Adger, & Kelly, 2005; Pelling & Uitto, 2001). The
benefits of assessing vulnerability at the national level are
that results can influence national-level policy responses and
adaptive management strategies (Hughes et al., 2012).
A Causal-Factor Approach
One key conceptual element is a clear distinction between
causal events and outcomes (Dilley & Boudreau, 2001).
Following the introduction by Sen (1981) of the notion of
accessibility beyond availability as a main determinant of
famine, the analysis of food security shifted from a study of
the sole natural causes to the inclusion of societal causes
(Blaikie, Cannon, Davis, & Wisner, 1994). The vulnerability
framework was indicated to describe and assess the multifac-
eted socioeconomic determinants of famine (Borton &
Shoham, 1991; Maxwell & Smith, 1992; Middleton &
O'Keefe, 1997; Ribot, 1995; Swift, 1989; as cited in Dilley
& Boudreau, 2001). The vulnerability approach, based on
natural disaster assessment, was then transposed to societal
causes for the analysis of food insecurity. In particular,
Chambers (1989) and Downing (1990) made considerable
efforts in converting Sen's analysis into assessment methods.
The main result was the expression "vulnerability to famine"
(p. 233), which became widely popular. It was understood in
direct relation to the final outcome. However, Downing
(1990) clearly stated that vulnerability is "a relative measure,
for a given population or region, of the underlying factors
that influence exposure to famine and predisposition to the
consequences of famine" (p. 18), aiming at identifying ele-
ments for a causal factor analysis.
In the food security context, the FAO specified that vul-
nerability is the relationship between risks, resulting shocks,
and resilience to these (FAO, 2004). The coupled risk­shock
component affects population wellbeing and food security,
whereas resilience concerns the strategies implemented to
mitigate the impact of the shocks. Vulnerability is under-
stood as directly correlated to the impact of shocks and is
inversely correlated to resilience (FAO, 2004). While the
natural disaster management approach to vulnerability
involved the identification of a degree of damage on popula-
tions or economic assets, food security specialists applied
6 SAGE Open
vulnerability to measure the intensity of the state of food
insecurity or famine (Dilley & Boudreau, 2001). Hence, it is
possible to define the FAO vulnerability approach to food
security analysis as a direct "outcome approach," while the
natural disaster method is rather a "causal factor approach,"
describing the interactions leading to the final outcomes.
Given the wide and complex sequence of phenomena
involved in food insecurity and environmental unsustainabil-
ity, the causal factor specification can also help to distinguish
several vulnerabilities of specific issues or outcomes. It
allows a dynamic analysis of the particular issues of vulner-
ability, instead of a static identification of vulnerability to a
broad and general final outcome. Furthermore, a broad
understanding of vulnerability on a wide range of sectors or
issues would not be sufficiently focused to implement actions
(Eakin & Luers, 2006;Ionescu, Klein, Hinkel, Kumar, &
Klein, 2009; Luers, 2005). Regarding the multidimensional-
ity of the concepts of food security and sustainability, assess-
ments based on one element or one dimension are no longer
considered sufficient (Aubin, Donnars, Supkova, & Dorin,
2013). There is a rising call for new types of systems analysis
and modeling tools (Nicholson et al., 2009). The fragmenta-
tion of the broad concept of vulnerability in an integrated
general framework is a first response to this need.
Vulnerability has evolved as a term of art and a concep-
tual framework to implement assessment methods in differ-
ent research areas, such as climate impact analysis
(Timmerman, 1981), disaster management (United Nations
Disaster Relief Organization [UNDRO], 1979), food secu-
rity (Chambers, 1989; Dilley & Boudreau, 2001), and sus-
tainability science (Turner et al., 2003). The analysis of
vulnerability can provide a conceptual and methodological
approach to the understanding of sustainability. It offers a
logical conceptual basis and method upon which to build a
modeling causal framework that raises awareness on vulner-
able people or entities to shocks, how and where the shocks
modified the living conditions, which are the response strate-
gies, the identification of the multiple metrics that assess the
phenomena. In addition, Turner et al. (2003) referred to vul-
nerability assessment as a coupled human-environment sys-
tem approach and reaffirmed the role of sustainability and
global change science in improving the bonds between the
science problem and decision-making needs.
Methodological Steps for the
Assessment of Vulnerability
A Composite Indicator
A joint assessment of food insecurity and environmental
unsustainability is strictly linked to the identification of a
methodological framework functioning as an architectural
net. In Rastoin et al. (2007), Cinner et al. (2012), Hughes et
al. (2012), as in the vulnerability composite index of food
insecurity in Manarolla (1989), vulnerability is calculated
through multidimensional score systems. The vulnerability
causal framework is modeled through three dimensions:
exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.
Exposure. Building on sustainability and natural disaster sci-
ences, exposure is considered as the degree to which a sys-
tem experiences environmental or sociopolitical stress
(Adger, 2006), including frequency, magnitude, duration,
and the areal extent of the hazard (Burton, Kates, & White,
1993). It can thus be interpreted as the likelihood of experi-
encing stress or perturbations (Downing, 1990). For the pur-
pose of this work, we define exposure as the degree to which
a system or a country is subjected to changes directly causing
or indirectly prompting food insecurity and environmental
unsustainability. For instance, in a context of dependency on
cereal imports, the share of cereals in total consumption can
indicate the degree of exposure to cereal price volatility.
Exposure is directly correlated with vulnerability.
Sensitivity. Sensitivity can be defined as the consequence of
the exposure to a stress. It is the degree to which a system is
modified or affected by the perturbations or the outcome of
an unwanted event to which the system is exposed (Adger,
2006). It can be understood as the likelihood of experiencing
different magnitudes of consequences of exposure to a stress
or perturbation (Downing, 1990). For instance, price elastici-
ties for cereals may represent the sensitivity to fluctuating
international cereal prices, as they represent the effective
impact of the exposure. Indicators of sensitivity are generally
measuring impacts. As for exposure, sensitivity is directly
correlated with vulnerability.
Adaptive capacity and resilience. The third component of vul-
nerability, related to adaptive capacity, was defined as the
potential of the system to respond to changes (Adger, Brooks,
Bentham, Agnew, & Eriksen, 2004; Burton, Huq, Lim, Pili-
fosova, & Schipper, 2002; IPCC, 2001). Cinner et al. (2012)
and Hughes et al. (2012) propose to disaggregate adaptive
capacity into several categories such as assets, flexibility,
learning, and social organization. In physics, resilience is the
resistance of an object to a given shock. According to Ras-
toin et al. (2007), the concept of resilience is applicable to
biology and human sciences as the resistance of an individ-
ual or a community to an external stress. For instance, when
coupled, exposure and sensitivity negatively affect people's
welfare and food security status. In the case of food price
volatility, resilience contains all the coping strategies that
can be implemented or are already implemented to avoid
exposure to risks and minimize impact sensitivity to the
shock, to overcome detrimental effects. National and global
institutions, for instance, by means of food price protection
policies, safety nets, and subsidies, can encourage these
strategies.
In an institutional context, resilience can represent stake-
holders'reactive capacity to cope with changes. Stakeholders
Prosperi et al. 7
can respond with coping and adapting strategies to rule eco-
nomic, finance, social institutional changes (North, 1991).
Sen (1985) similarly identifies for individuals the capacity to
manage opportunities deriving from risk effects, by means of
the concept of capabilities. The stakeholders, searching in
their natural, human, physical, and social assets, take the
opportunity of the environmental changes, transforming
these resources in capabilities, which allows overcoming the
shocks' impacts and to be prepared for the next risks. For
these characteristics that identify resilience (or adaptive
capacity), the concept is often associated with sustainability
(Conway, 1985; Strunz, 2012). While vulnerability is directly
associated with risks and shocks impacts, resilience is
inversely correlated with vulnerability (FAO, 2004). People
who overcome negative impacts of changes (and end up in
an even better situation) would be resilient; those suffering
from the effects of the modifications would be considered as
vulnerable (Rastoin et al., 2007).
Calculating a Vulnerability Score
In Rastoin et al. (2007), the estimation method is based on
the capabilities approach; vulnerability is then assessed
solely on the one component of adaptive capacity/resilience.
In a more general framework, this approach could be also
associated with the exposure and sensitivity dimensions.
Cinner et al. (2012) and Hughes et al. (2012) calculate vul-
nerability as Exposure + Sensitivity - Adaptive Capacity
(Figure 1). Lower levels of the final score indicate lower
level of vulnerability. Following the original structure
designed by Hughes et al. (2012), keeping the same logical
sequence of signs, Figure 1 outlines several n vulnerabilities.
This specification of n different vulnerabilities of different
issues to different drivers of change aims to capture the mul-
tidimensional feature of sustainability.
The order and the signs used for the methods of calcula-
tion of vulnerability define the relationships between the
three components. However, in a metric-identifying
approach, the indicators come from different sources and
disciplines, and are expressed in different units of measure-
ment. Index values then need to be standardized or normal-
ized. In many cases (Cinner et al., 2012; The Economist
Intelligence Unit, 2013; Hughes et al., 2012), data normal-
ization is based on minimum and maximum values in the
data set, and places on a scale from 0 to 1 (from 0 to 100 for
the Global Food Safety Initiative [GFSI], 2012) using the
typical normalization method "min-max" (Adger & Vincent,
2005; Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and
Development[OECD], 2008):
i X X X X X
min max min
( ) = -
( ) -
( )
/ .
In this formula, X
min
and X
max
are, respectively, the lowest
and highest values for any given indicator. The normalized
value is transformed from a 0 to 1 value to make it directly
comparable with other indicators. This means that the indica-
tor with the highest raw data value will score 1, whereas the
lowest will score 0.
In the examples referred to, the indicator scores are nor-
malized and then aggregated across categories to enable a
comparison of broader concepts across countries.
Normalization rebases the raw indicator data to a common
unit, so that it can be aggregated.
Finally, in our specific case the n particular vulnerabilities
will be calculated following this formula:
V
E E E E
S S S S
=
( )
+( )
AC AC AC AC
min max

- - -
min max min
min max min

m

( )










,
where V = vulnerability, E = exposure, S = sensitivity, and
AC = adaptive capacity.
Another issue that has to be considered is the quantitative
relevance, or weight, that is associated with the different
components. Different metric systems often rely on equal
weights, leaving to policymakers, practitioners, and stake-
holders the opportunity to apply a goal- or priority-oriented
weighting system (The Economist Intelligence Unit, 2013;
Hammond, Keeney, & Raiffa, 1999; McClanahan et al.,
2008; Saaty, 1986).
Based on this approach, it would be possible to rank the
Mediterranean countries in relation to their exposure, sensi-
tivity, and adaptive capacity vis-à-vis changes affecting
agrofood systems in their food and nutrition security
outcomes.
Discussion of the Approach
Metrics, Analysis, and Prospective
The vulnerability approach stresses the need for methods and
metrics that do not just express final results or outcomes, but

provides a system of information that can be interpreted in a
dynamic framework modeling interactions between different
drivers. In particular, the vulnerability framework can be dis-
aggregated in several dimensions according to the different
drivers of change considered: vulnerability to climate
change, vulnerability to price volatility, vulnerability to
demographic transformations, etc. The integrated fragmenta-
tion of the broad vulnerability into specific vulnerabilities
represents a response to the lack of causal factor analysis.
As mentioned above, each specific vulnerability can be
further broken down into exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive
capacity. However, both the sensitivity and adaptive capacity
dimensions of the system have to be assessed according to
specific outcomes or services provided by the food system
that need to be maintained over time. For instance, access to
food may be jeopardized in the short term by high food price
volatility; however, food supply might not be affected in the
same way or to the same extent. Thus, problematic issues or
hotspots, related to the agrofood system and local context,
need to be specified. Three stages of causal factor analysis
can be established through the vulnerability framework. In a
nutshell, the framework allows organizing evidence-based
information and aiding decision-making by clarifying
sequential dynamics, while allowing for prospective or for-
ward-looking analysis.
Therefore, it is important to define issues and challenges
of food security and sustainability before choosing assess-
ment methods (Aubin et al., 2013). The qualitative identifi-
cation of the problematic issues, and then of the variables to
assess vulnerability, can be obtained through a hierarchical
analysis (Rastoin et al., 2007), previous field observations
(Cinner et al., 2012; Hughes et al., 2012), a literature review
and expert consultation, and using statistical methods such as
principal components analysis (Jolliffe, 1986).
The vulnerability framework can lead, for example,
through participatory methods, to the identification of a sys-
tem of indicators and appropriate metrics, offering a method
to capture complexity and interconnectedness between phe-
nomena (Dilley & Boudreau, 2001; Turner et al., 2003).
Furthermore, as indicators inform action (Barrett, 2010),
they are essential to establish the communicative link
between science and policymakers. One essential aim of the
vulnerability analysis remains in the identification of the
response opportunities for decision-making (Dilley &
Boudreau, 2001; Rastoin et al., 2007; Turner et al., 2003).
To summarize, several functions can be attributed to the
vulnerability approach, such as a holistic and novel assess-
ment framework and a dynamic tool for sustainability sci-
ences; a geographical-based approach involving the
participation of local stakeholders; a multiple factor analysis
allowing interdisciplinary research on complex and sys-
temic phenomena; a scheme to conceptualize and develop
metrics, in a system of information and response opportuni-
ties for decision making; a methodology to draw evidence-
based knowledge; a predictive framework to anticipate
consequences of hazards and changes (Adger, 2006; Dilley
& Boudreau, 2001; Füssel, 2006; Locatelli et al., 2008;
Rastoin et al., 2007; Sonwa, Somorin, Jum, Bele, & Nkem,
2012; Turner et al., 2003; Watts & Bohle, 1993). The main
advantages of a vulnerability approach to the analysis of
sustainability of food system activities are summarized in

Identifying Issues and Dealing With
Multidimensionality
Limits to this conceptual approach depend strongly on the
level of accuracy of the application. The main risk is the lack
of a genuine causal factors analysis that can be avoided by
disentangling the multiple vulnerabilities and their compo-
nents. Thus, one crucial element in the application of the vul-
nerability approach resides in the level of accuracy in
defining the problematic issues that are, in our specific case,
driven by nutrition and food security concerns of the agro-
food system.
Furthermore, scholars and practitioners highly focused on
one specific scientific discipline may be skeptical with regard
to the large amount of variables. However, the development
of a multidimensional metrics framework can open a stimu-
lating scientific debate involving experiences from several
disciplines and feed the scientific knowledge base. Indeed, as
observed in sustainability science and resilience thinking,
inter- and trans-disciplinary communication is strictly linked
to problem solving--instead of puzzle-solving--and related
to participative creativity instead of dogmatism (Strunz,
2012). So, the development of the framework aims to create
a flexible tool that can be adapted and modeled (as for a
weighting system) to different users' and to different policy
purposes related to nutrition and food security concerns. The
involvement of the stakeholders is key to building up the
framework and to assigning hierarchy to the indicators
(Aubin et al., 2013).
In conclusion, this scheme provides a multidimensional
vulnerability framework to jointly assess nutrition and food
insecurity and unsustainability. Starting from a specific geo-
graphical region, it represents a tool for policymakers. The
Mediterranean geographical area, as a physical space where
several environmental, social and economic and nutrition
hotspots of vulnerability persist over time, offers a first case
of application. The last subsection presents an analysis of
some representative interactions between drivers of change,
and food and nutrition security issues, together with the
description of the resulting exposure, sensitivity, and adap-
tive capacity.
Examples of Application
Application of the vulnerability assessment framework
requires specifying the context and the issues of concern.
These can be identified by literature review or participative
expert consultation. The analysis of each specific issue or
hotspot of vulnerability (of a given geographical area) allows
us to establish from which point of the causal sequence of
phenomena, the components of exposure, sensitivity, and
adaptive capacity can be applied.
For the sake of illustration, we provide three examples of
how to apply the vulnerability model to the specific geo-
graphical Mediterranean region. Given the nutrition and food
security-driven perspective of this work, three main issues
critical to the food system, namely supply, accessibility, and
nutritional value, are assessed, considering the three compo-
nents of vulnerability. Each issue is analyzed against three
different landscape drivers of change, respectively, climate
change, price volatility and nutritional transition and chang-
ing consumption patterns. This selection of driver/issue com-
binations, restricted to three for the sake of illustration, does
not presume that the drivers cannot have impacts on several
issues.
Food supply­related vulnerability to climate change.National
food supply rests on food production, stocks, and imports
(minus exports). It relies also on quantities used from feed,
seeds, and transformation. Depending on the agrofood policy
strategies and on their financial system conditions, a national
food system can be vulnerable because of several factors or
drivers affecting food supply. The conceptual model pro-
vides an approach that develops a series of questions. A per-
tinent question can be the following: To which extent are the
Mediterranean countries vulnerable to climate change to
supply sufficient food commodities?
Given the crucial issue around water supply in the
Mediterranean region, geographic indicators of the availabil-
ity and quality of water can be considered a relevant measure
of the exposure of a national (or a subnational) food system
to climate change in terms of provisioning of food.
Consequently, sensitivity to this exposure can be expressed
according to the specific level of consumption of water-
demanding commodities by the households or the agroindus-
try. In response, agrobiodiversity could be an indicator of
adaptive capacity to climate change, based on the assump-
tion that biodiversity increases the stocks of crop material to
draw upon to select or develop more drought-resistant crops.
Ability to import from less exposed agricultural systems to
climate change might be another indication of adaptive
capacity.
Food accessibility­related vulnerability to international price vola-
tility.Food accessibility involves both physical access and
affordability for individuals to adequate resource of food. A
research question that emerges can be the following: To
which extent are the Mediterranean countries vulnerable,
considering their economic constraints, biophysical condi-
tions, and social habits, in their access to adequate food in the
face of high price volatility? Given the high cereal import
dependency of some Mediterranean countries (for human
consumption, industry demand, and animal feeding), expo-
sure could be assessed by considering the caloric share of
cereals in a representative household's food basket: The
more cereals consumed, the higher the exposure for import-
dependent countries. Price elasticities for cereals might offer
a proxy for countries' sensitivity to fluctuating international
cereal prices. Conversely, analyzing food consumption pat-
terns, and households' capacity to shift toward cheaper or
10 SAGE Open
locally available food, while meeting the same caloric and
nutritional requirements, may indicate strong adaptive
capacities. Cross-price elasticities illustrate substitution pos-
sibilities. Countries can enhance this adaptive capacity by
implementing food policies that diversify supply sources, by
acting directly on food prices (e.g., subsidies), by providing
social nets for the population (e.g., food stamps) or promot-
ing diversity in consumption patterns.
Nutritional quality­related vulnerability to nutritional transition
and changing consumption patterns. Utilization encompasses
all the factors related to how food is consumed and involves
quality elements. In a nutrition-driven approach, we consider
also nutritional values of foods and adequacy of diets to
nutrient recommendations. Therefore, the research question
in our specific context can be the following: In which way
and to which extent are the Mediterranean countries vulner-
able, considering nutritional value and nutrient adequacy, to
nutritional transition and changing consumption patterns?
Over the past 50 years, the Mediterranean region has
undergone important structural demographic and spatial
transformations with an increasing share of its population
now located in urban centers. Urbanization trends can be
suggested as a proxy for exposure to changing food con-
sumption habits, on the assumption that urban and rural con-
sumption patterns are significantly different. Correlated with
urbanization, industry and labor structures can be selected to
indicate to which extent Mediterranean countries are exposed
to nutritional transition. Subsequently, countries and popula-
tions manifest sensitivity to these exposures with critical
data on the prevalence of health problems directly related to
diet,suchasobesityorcardiovasculardiseases.Governments,
policymakers, and individuals can implement a set of tools to
enhance adaptive capacity, such as ensuring an efficient
health system, improving education and promoting food and
healthy eating and lifestyle habits, guiding consumption pat-
terns, and raising awareness on these issues within institu-
tions and the private sector.
Conclusion
While securing food security is considered a global priority,
there is a contemporary widespread consensus about the
importance of sustainability as a goal for food systems. This
article provides a conceptual hierarchical framework for
modeling the complex relationships between food and nutri-
tion security and sustainability. It initially analyzed the inter-
nationally acknowledged concepts of sustainable
development and food security, describing the interconnect-
edness between them that recent notions such as sustainable
food security or sustainable diets try to capture.
Relying on an approach of the concept of sustainability as
a system property allowing a desirable state to be "sustained"
over generations, assessment methodologies should reflect
the conditions of a system from a holistic and dynamic
perspective. Calling on elements from the vulnerability and
resilience literature, the proposed framework sequentially
disentangles the exposure, sensitivity, and copying/adaptive
capacities of a specific food system to identified stressors or
drivers of change jeopardizing critical food and nutrition
security outcomes.
This approach entails also the assessment of sustainability
with regard to a suitable temporal and spatial scale. Drivers
affecting the sustainability of the food systems have multiple
origins. The proposed framework hierarchically clarifies the
different scale at which drivers and issues interact in a circu-
lar way with feedback loops. While suitable for expressing
the global food-related concerns of a geographical region, it
points out the need for assessment tools adapted to context-
specific questions. Main data and general insights of the situ-
ation of the Mediterranean region help underline the main
critical issues related to food and nutrition security facing the
agrofood system in the region.
A quantitative method is proposed for assessing sustain-
ability of food and nutrition outcomes by means of a precise
correlation between the three components of exposure, sen-
sitivity, and adaptive capacities, which can ultimately be
aggregated in a composite index. The joint assessment of
food insecurity and unsustainability can be expressed through
the language of vulnerability and resilience, as the degree to
which a system is exposed and sensitive to dynamic phenom-
ena, while considering its capability to respond and adapt.
This approach provides the concepts fundamental to the
development of potential indicators or metrics of sustainable
diets and food systems, whose primary goal is to ensure food
security and good nutrition for a healthy and active life.

5. The share of different commodities in total supply is used also
as a proxy metric of dietary diversity, which is strictly linked
to health and nutrition factors.
6. Malconsumption results in an excess intake of calories that
contribute to overweight and obesity, and represents a burden
for the poor across the world (Sage, 2013).
7. The concept of virtual water clearly depicts the global shifts
of water embedded in products. Virtual water associates con-
sumer goods to an amount of water needed to produce them.
For instance, the difference in water consumption was mea-
sured between a diet rich in meat (5,400 liters virtual per day) or
vegetarian (2,600 liters) for American eaters (Hoekstra, 2003).
In particular, virtual water indicates the volume of freshwater
used to produce a given good, counted at the place where the
product was de facto produced (Hoekstra & Chapagain, 2008;
Van Oel, Mekonnen, & Hoekstra, 2009). The concept of vir-
tual water reveals how much water is needed to produce differ-
ent goods and services.
