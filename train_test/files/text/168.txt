This study employs new data on Mexican-origin individuals aged 65 and older in the
Southwestern United States to examine the impact of the age at which an individual immi-
grated to the United States on his or her sources of income and living arrangements. The
data reveal that, in general, those who immigrated after the age of 50 are more dependent
on their families than the native born or those who immigrated earlier in life. Although our
findings must be interpreted cautiously because of small cell sizes, those who immigrated
later in life are found to be less likely than the native born or those who immigrated earlier
to have private pensions and Social Security income. They are also more likely to be living
with their children and to be receiving money from them. We discuss the implications of
recent restrictions on the eligibility of even legal immigrants for Supplemental Security
Income on intergenerational relations and on the potential burden placed on the older
immigrant's family, many of which may be seriously strained in hard economic times.

Evidence From the Mexican American EPESE

Although the United States is a nation of immigrants,
the public and their representatives are more con-
cerned today with the potential welfare burden that
new immigrants might represent than with their po-
tential contribution to our society (Fix & Passel, 1994;
Treas, 1997). These sentiments have resulted in legis-
lation that seriously restricts the eligibility of even
legal immigrants for social welfare and that requires
their sponsors to guarantee support for five years
(Friedland & Pankaj, 1997). These changes in social
welfare eligibility have important implications for fam-
ily reunification and for immigrants who come to this
country in mature adulthood. Younger immigrants come
to find work (Fix & Passel, 1994). Older immigrants,
for the most part, come to join their children and grand-
children. Many simply do not have the resources nor
the opportunity to accumulate enough once they
arrive to support themselves in old age. As a conse-
quence, older immigrants may remain permanently de-
pendent on their families.
Although older immigrants still represent a small frac-
tion of the total immigrant stream, recent changes in
immigration policy have resulted in an increase in the

number of older individuals who are admitted as per-
manent residents each year (Treas, 1997). The new
and harsher social welfare philosophy that denies many
vulnerable individuals, including elderly immigrants,
access to public programs has serious implications for
intergenerational relations and the welfare of both the
old and the young. Although there is no way of knowing
what the long-term effects of the restrictions on pub-
lic support will be, our nation's experience with eco-
nomic dependency suggests that the need that one
level of government ceases to provide for must be pro-
vided for by another level of government, or by other
institutions. In the current anti-immigrant and antiwelfare
climate, families who, out of genuine affection and a
sense of duty to their elders, wish to bring aging par-
ents to live with them, may be forced to choose be-
tween those parents and other needs. Our national
commitment to family values requires that we begin
to understand the impact of social policies on immi-
grant families.
Immigrants and the Welfare Burden
Today's immigrants are very different ethnically
than they were in the past. During the nineteenth
and first half of the twentieth centuries immigrants to
the United States came primarily from Europe (Bean,
Cushing, Haynes, & Van Hook, 1997; Fuchs & Forbes,
1985) and despite the differences between the new
immigrants and longer-term residents, the incorpora-
tion of European Americans followed similar patterns
(Alba, 1990; Lieberson & Waters, 1990). Since the
Vol. 39, No. 1, 1999 59
1960s the composition of the immigrant population
has changed dramatically. Today those who arrive on
our shores are primarily from Latin America and Asia
and, because of limitations on the number of legal
immigrants allowed in, a significant number are illegal
(Fix & Passel, 1994; Massey, Alarcon, Durand, & Gon-
zalez, 1987; Portes & Bach, 1985).
Although the actual welfare burden that these new
immigrants represent is a matter of debate, several studies
based on U.S. Census data show that, except for refu-
gees who are legally eligible for public assistance upon
arrival, immigrants of working age are less likely than
natives of similar socioeconomic backgrounds to re-
ceive public assistance (Bean, Van Hook, & Glick, 1997;
Fix & Passel, 1994; Tienda & Jensen, 1986; Trejo,
1992). There is a great deal of difference in the pro-
pensity of immigrants to use public support, however,
depending upon their nation of origin and age. Mexi-
can, Central American, and Asian immigrants draw
upon public assistance at far higher rates than Euro-
pean immigrant groups, and regardless of their nation
of origin, older immigrants draw upon Supplemental
Security Income (SSI) at higher rates than native-born
individuals (Van Hook, 1996).
The welfare picture for immigrants is, therefore, com-
plex and it is clear that compositional differences among
groups, as well as their individual migration experi-
ences, influence their use of various forms of welfare.
For the most part, the higher rates of welfare use by
Asian and Mexican/Central American immigrants are
accounted for by their less favorable socioeconomic
profiles (Bean, Van Hook, & Glick, 1997; Tienda &
Jensen, 1986). In this article we examine the income
sources and living arrangements of older Mexican-
origin immigrants. We are particularly interested in the
impact of the age at which an individual comes to
the United States on his or her access to income from
private pensions, Social Security, and SSI. Previous work
makes it clear that the most significant factor that
differentiates the economically secure from the in-
secure in retirement is a private pension (Angel &
Angel, 1997). If older Mexican immigrants are less
likely than natives or earlier migrants to have a pen-
sion, and if they do not receive Social Security or SSI,
then they have nowhere to turn but to family mem-
bers. This potential burden may play a role in a
family's reunification decision. Even if an older indi-
vidual provides useful domestic services, the financial
burden he or she can potentially represent may make
reunification impossible.
The Consequences of Later Life Migration
Our examination of the consequences of one's age
at migration is informed by a life-course perspective
from which the motivations for, as well as the conse-
quences of, migration differ for different age groups.
Children, of course, migrate because they accompany
their parents. Young adults, for the most part, migrate
to find jobs and a better place to raise their families.
International migrants have historically been young
people and families seeking new opportunities. Older
people tend not to move, and sending areas often
become old as the young migrate and leave their par-
ents and grandparents behind. At a certain point in
life, giving up one's familiar environment is too great
a cost to pay for uncertain gains in a totally new en-
vironment. Those older individuals who do migrate
usually do so to rejoin their families (Portes & Rumbaut,
1990; Wilmoth, Dejong, & Himes, 1997). Elderly mi-
grants, therefore, are selected both on the basis of
their willingness to move and by the availability of
sponsors in the receiving area.
International migrants are overwhelmingly young be-
cause the young are more adaptable than the old and
find it easier to learn a new language and culture.
Those individuals who migrate in childhood are often
indistinguishable in adulthood from the native born.
Because of their psychological and intellectual adapt-
ability, the young are better able to assimilate into the
new culture, to learn the workings of its institutions,
and to become occupationally and economically suc-
cessful. As a consequence, they have a good chance
of becoming financially independent by the time of
retirement.
Unfortunately, as anyone who has attempted to
learn a second language in adulthood can testify, the
ease with which a language can be learned is lost fairly
quickly, and the older one becomes the more diffi-
culty he or she encounters in adapting to an entirely
new set of cultural rules and institutions. Of necessity,
therefore, the assimilation experience is far less com-
plete, both culturally and structurally, for those who
migrate later in life than for those who migrate in
childhood or young adulthood (Angel & Angel, 1992;
Evans, 1987; Findley, 1988; Kasl & Berkman, 1983;
Rogler, Gurak, & Cooney, 1987). In addition, those
who come with few resources and begin accumulat-
ing assets in mature adulthood simply do not have
the time necessary to amass a large reserve.
Today, family reunification and migration by entire
families means that a significant number of individuals
come to the United States later in life (Angel & Angel,
1992; Treas, 1997). For the immigrant, the family is a
haven both of choice and of necessity. Immigrants of
all ages are more likely than the native born to live
with family members and to rely on them for assis-
tance (Angel & Angel, 1992; Biafora & Longino, 1990;
Weeks & Cuellar, 1981, 1983). For the older immi-
grant, the family is often the only source of instru-
mental and emotional assistance (Angel & Angel, 1992).
Clearly older individuals can provide valuable domes-
tic services that allow other family members to enter
the labor force, thereby enhancing the overall eco-
nomic welfare of a household (Angel & Tienda, 1982).
Nonetheless, because their own income remains low,
the option of living alone often does not exist, and
the needs of the older individual for economic sup-
port often mean that they remain dependent on the
family.
In what follows, we examine the consequences of
the age at which older Mexican Americans came to
the United States on their living arrangements and their
sources of income. One's living arrangements and in-
come sources are closely linked because the adequacy
of one's income determines whether one can live alone
60 The Gerontologist
if one chooses. Previous research also shows that the
sources of one's retirement income greatly determine
the adequacy of one's retirement income. The largest
fraction of the incomes of those retirees who are well
off financially is from private pensions. Those older
individuals who must rely on Social Security alone or
on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) are far worse
off (Angel & Angel, 1997).
The data on which the following analyses are based
are from a new benchmark survey of older Mexican
Americans in five southwestern states. The topic is par-
ticularly timely because of recent changes in immigra-
tion and welfare policy that may affect the elderly im-
migrant. Older immigrants who are sponsored by their
children are forced into dependency on them by the
fact that voluntary immigrants do not qualify for SSI
for a period of five years and by the fact that the
income and asset eligibility criteria for SSI are quite
stringent. In determining eligibility for SSI the sponsor's
income and assets are taken into account. An older
immigrant may well, therefore, find himself or herself
permanently dependent on family because neither em-
ployment nor public support are realistic options.
Data
The study employs data from the Hispanic Estab-
lished Population for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly
(HEPESE), a large, multistage probability sample of
Mexican Americans aged 65 and older who reside
in the southwestern states of Arizona, California, Colo-
rado, New Mexico, and Texas (Markides, Rudkin,
Angel, & Espino, 1997). The present analysis is based
on the first wave of the study, which consists of a
survey of 3,050 individuals. All respondents were in-
terviewed in their homes for approximately two hours
by trained interviewers who assessed their functional
capacity and collected information on nativity, age
at migration, acculturation, demographics, household
structure, and socioeconomic resources. For those in-
dividuals who were too cognitively or physically im-
paired to participate in the study, information on ob-
jective questions was obtained from a proxy familiar
with the older person. Ten percent of the completed
interviews were either entirely or partially carried out
with a proxy's assistance.
Results
The logic of the analysis is as follows. We begin
with detailed descriptions of the socioeconomic pro-
file, including detailed income sources, of older indi-
viduals who immigrated at different ages and com-
pare them to the native born. We present these data
separately for men and women because income sources
for the two genders differ significantly in this sample.
We then examine the living arrangements of married
and single older men and women who immigrated at
different ages and compare those with the living
arrangements of the native born. Finally we present
logistic regressions predicting the three major sources
of income among the elderly, private pensions, Social
Security, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), to
determine the net impact of age at migration on these
various sources of income.
Table 1 presents information on the socioeconomic
profile of Mexican-origin men 65 and older by the
age at which they immigrated to the United States.
The last column presents information for the native
born. Table 2 presents similar information for Mexi-
can-origin women aged 65 and older. Because of the
complex sampling design of the survey, we employ
the program package SUDAAN (Research Triangle In-
stitute, 1995) to adjust for design effects in computing
descriptive statistics, parameter estimates, and tests of
significance in all of the following analyses.
Tables 1 and 2 show that those older individuals
who immigrated when they were 50 years of age or
older have different income profiles than those who
came when they were younger. For both men and
women, those who came in mature adulthood are more
likely than either natives or those who immigrated at
younger ages to report the lowest household incomes.
Those who came when they were 50 or older are
also less likely than natives or those who came when
they were younger to receive Social Security. The find-
ings with regard to private pensions are striking. Al-
though those who migrated later in life are less likely
to report having a private pension than either the na-
tive born or those who came earlier in life, in none of
the age at migration groups does a substantial fraction
of individuals receive income from a private pension.
Only 36% of native-born men report a private pen-
sion and only 6.9% of those who immigrated after

age 50 report income from this source. Because in-
come from a private pension is such an important de-
terminant of an adequate income in old age, the lack
of pension income has significant negative implications
for the Mexican origin elderly generally (Angel & An-
gel, 1997). Finally, Table 1 reveals that for native-born
men and those who immigrated before age 20, the
military is a significant source of retirement income.
In our data this category includes those who receive
Railroad Retirement income, but it consists overwhelm-
ingly of military retirees.
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is the means-
tested support program for unemployed older indi-
viduals who have not contributed enough to the sys-
tem to qualify for regular earnings-based benefits. It is
a particularly important source of income for older
individuals with no private retirement income and few
assets. Although there is some tendency for foreign-
born men to receive SSI at higher rates than the na-
tive born, these differences are not statistically signifi-
cant. Table 2 shows that women rely on SSI much
more heavily than men, but those who arrived later
in life are less likely than those who arrived at the
earliest age to receive SSI. Under the new guidelines,
recent immigrants are barred from receiving SSI for a
period of five years. During this time they are entirely
dependent on their sponsors for support.
Table 2 also reveals that a larger fraction of those
women who immigrated at age 50 or older receive
money from children than those who came before
age 20. In general, then, these data indicate that
women who immigrated at 50 years of age or older
are more dependent on their families for support

than are the native born or those who came earlier in
life.
In order to examine another aspect of older immi-
grants' dependency on family, in Tables 3 and 4 we
present information on the living arrangements of
older married and single Mexican-origin men and
women, again by the age at which they immigrated
to the United States. These tables illustrate the greater
dependence of those who immigrated in mature adult-
hood on others. Among married men and women,
those who came to the United States when they were
50 or older are far less likely than the native born or
those who immigrated at earlier ages to be the head
of the household^ in which they reside. Among single
women (Table 4, second panel), those who came later
in life are far more likely than the native born or those
who arrived earlier to live with someone else, but not
as the head of household, and they are the least likely
to live alone. These data, therefore, suggest that women
who come later in life are heavily dependent on their

families for support. Clearly, at this level of disaggre-
gation cell sizes become rather small so, although our
findings are suggestive, they are only tentative. Again
these data demonstrate that those individuals who im-
migrated earlier in life are more similar to the native
born than they are to later-life migrants.
In Table 5 we present logistic regression models pre-
dicting the three major income sources among the
elderly for single and married individuals. These mod-
els control for several factors that influence the prob-
ability of receiving income from each source, includ-
ing current age, gender, education, age at migration,
problems with instrumental activities of daily living,
one's living arrangements, one's own and one's spouse's
employment status, and the number of children one
has. The reference categories for categorical variables
are listed in parentheses under the variable label. These
models also control for language of interview. Nearly
77% of unmarried and 80% of married individuals re-
sponded to the survey in Spanish. A control for proxy
response was not significant so it was dropped from
the models.
Our focus in this table is on the net impact of one's
age when one immigrated on the probability of re-
ceiving income from the three main sources available
to elders. These models reveal clear net disadvant-
ages among later-life migrants in the receipt of income
from the most common formal sources. Among single
individuals, those who immigrated at age 50 or older
are significantly less likely to receive SSI, Social Secu-
rity, or private pensions. The odds ratios associated
with these coefficients reveal that those who came
later in life are only 46% as likely as the native born
to receive SSI (e-77), 25% as likely to receive Social
Security (e~1-40), and 14% as likely to receive income
from a private pension (e~1").
Among married individuals, those who immigrated
at age 50 or older are less likely to receive Social Se-
curity (21% as likely as the native born). When Span-
ish interview is not included, married indviduals are
also far less likely to receive income from a private
pension. When Spanish interview is included, the co-
efficient for private pension becomes insignificant. For
both single and married individuals, though, the use
of Spanish is associated with a greatly reduced likeli-
hood of having a private pension. Because those who
immigrated at later ages are most likely to have taken
the interview in Spanish (73% for single individuals
and over 97% for married individuals) and to be less
fluent in English, this variable further underscores the
private pension disadvantage of later-life migrants.
Discussion
These data provide some intriguing evidence that
later-life immigrants are particularly dependent on their
families. Because they arrive with few resources, and
have few opportunities and little time to save for re-
tirement, that dependency may in many cases be perma-
nent. Given the recent tightening of eligibility criteria
for SSI and other social programs, this dependency
has important implications for families' decisions as to
whether to bring an older relative to the United States.
For such families the desire to bring their parents or
other relatives to be with them is a natural outgrowth
of love and a sense of obligation. For social policy,

the relevant questions we must address have to do
with the consequences of changes in the way social
welfare is provided for both the older individual and
his or her family.
The recent changes in immigration law and tighter
restrictions on SSI for even legal immigrants run the
risk of making the situation of many older Mexican
immigrants and their families more difficult than it
already is. The Personal Responsibility and Work
Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA)
excluded even legal immigrants from receiving SSI or
food stamps unless they fall into certain exemption
categories (Dunkelberg, 1997). The Balanced Budget
Act of 1997 relaxed some of these restrictions and
allowed those legal immigrants who were receiving SSI
prior to August 22, 1996, or those who were legal
immigrants prior to that date and who subsequently
become disabled, to continue receiving or to qualify
for benefits. These individuals, however, cannot re-
ceive SSI based solely on economic need and old age
as can native-born U.S. citizens.
Immigrants who arrived after August 22, 1996, are
treated very differently, though, and are excluded
from participation in all federal means-tested benefit
programs for a period of five years (Dunkelberg, 1997).
In this new immigration environment those who
sponsor an older immigrant assume a large and po-
tentially burdensome responsibility. For at least five years
family members who wish to bring their aging parents
to live closer to them must provide housing and all of
the older person's other needs, even in the case of
serious disability.
During periods of low unemployment and relative
economic prosperity, many families with dependent
elderly members find it possible to bear the burden
of a dependent older parent. However, as times be-
come more difficult such families may be placed un-
der greater strain because they must provide for both
children and for the dependent elders. Among groups
that are struggling to survive and to move into the
economic mainstream, such a burden may prove
excessive and hinder the social mobility of all con-
cerned.
Our immigration policy has been based on a de-
sire to help reunify families. It reflects a belief that
immigrants have the same rights as those who came
earlier to bring parents, as well as children, to this
nation. Such policies clearly reflect basic values and
imply a certain commitment of material resources to
make that outcome possible. Current antiwelfare and
anti-immigrant public sentiments, however, make the
objective of family reunification more difficult. Fami-
lies that choose to bring aging parents to this country,
and especially those families wno are themselves new
arrivals and who bring aging parents with them, as-
sume a rather large responsibility with no assurance
against serious economic reversals. If the older indi-
vidual becomes seriously disabled the potential drain
on family resources could be devastating. We have
yet to see if private charity will prove adequate in
assisting these families.
Our current welfare policy concerning immigrants
is based on a philosophy that we have not seen for
several decades and one that has serious implications
for the welfare of the elderly population, as does the
dismantling of traditional welfare for children. This harsher
public policy philosophy in which many vulnerable in-
dividuals are denied welfare is new and its full impli-
cations will be known only after several years of ex-
perience. Although there is no way of knowing for
sure at this point, our previous experiences with eco-
nomic dependency suggests that the need that one
level of government ceases to provide for must be pro-
vided for by another. It is doubtful that, at this point
in our history, we as a nation are willing to accept the
serious deprivation that the lack of an adequate sys-
tem of social welfare brought in previous eras. If we
are still committed to family values and to the reunifi-
cation of older parents with their children, some new
means of ensuring their welfare without overburden-
ing vulnerable families will have to be found.
