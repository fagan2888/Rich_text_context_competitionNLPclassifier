Background--There have been significant bidirectional changes in the prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors over
time in the United States, making the net trend in risk for incident CV disease unknown. We assessed these trends by
applying the Framingham Heart Study prediction model to national data.
Methods and Results--The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) II (1976­1980), NHANES III
(1988­1994), and NHANES 1999­2004 are cross-sectional representative samples of the noninstitutionalized
population of the United States. We excluded people with a history of CV disease, pregnant women, participants with
missing CV risk factors data, and individuals outside the Framingham age range of 30 to 74 years. The Framingham risk
function was used to estimate the 10-year risk for incident symptomatic CV disease. We calculated the slope of change
or rate of change per year between NHANES II and III, and between NHANES III and 1999­2004. The difference
between slopes was calculated and compared to zero. The average age-adjusted 10-year CV risk between NHANES II
and III decreased from 10.0% to 7.9% between NHANES II and III, with a statistically significant slope (P0.001).
However, the average age-adjusted CV risk decreased at a lesser magnitude between NHANES III and NHANES
1999­2004 from 7.9% to 7.4% (P0.001). These slopes were significantly different (P0.0001). In women and
middle-aged participants, CV risk did not change between NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2004 (P0.40).
Conclusions--The estimated net risk for CV disease in the US population decreased from 1976­1980 to 1988­1994 but
has changed minimally from 1988­1994 to 1999­2004, particularly in women and middle-aged people. (Circ

Key Words: obesity  epidemiology  prevention & control  risk factors
Cardiovascular (CV) disease represents the most common
cause of death in the United States, accounting for
approximately 1 million deaths annually.1 Multiple reports
have demonstrated significant changes in the prevalence of
CV risk factors over the last 30 years, including downward
trends in cholesterol2 and cigarette smoking,3,4 and an early
decrease in the prevalence of hypertension for the last 10
years.5­9 There have also been increases in the prevalence of
obesity10,11 and diabetes mellitus.12­14 Because these major
CV risk factors provide different strengths of risk for incident
myocardial infarction,15 it is unknown whether the net trend
in risk for incident CV disease in the United States has
increased, decreased, or has remained stable over the last 3
decades.
Epidemiological studies assessing the trend in CV disease
incidence has demonstrated conflicting results in the inci-
dence of myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease as
a whole.16 The ascertainment of temporal trends in incident
CV disease is difficult. Major challenges include change in
the diagnostic criteria for myocardial infarction, changes in
physicians practice, the discovery of new methods in diag-
nosing preclinical coronary disease, and the discovery and
wide implementation of highly sensitive techniques in detect-
ing myocardial injury. Despite the overwhelming evidence
demonstrating a decrease in age-adjusted CV mortality over
the last decades,17­19 it is unclear whether the bidirectional
trends in CV risk factors are reflected in a reduced risk for
incident CV disease.
Validated risk prediction formulas can estimate individual
coronary risk.20 The formulas or algorithms are based on
predictive modeling, which has been extensively validated in
different populations in the United States20,21 and else-
where.22,23 These prediction formulas provide reliable esti-
mates of global population risk and help in identifying
changes in net CV risk.

Using data from 3 consecutive population-based health
surveys in the United States over the past 30 years, we
assessed the trends in the net 10-year-risk for incident CV
disease using the Framingham Coronary Heart Disease risk
score.20 We hypothesized that 10-year risk for incident CV
disease has decreased between 1976­1980 and 1988­1994,
but remained unchanged between 1988­1994 and 1999­
2004 because of the significant increase in the prevalence of
obesity and obesity-related CV risk factors.
WHAT IS KNOWN
 Cardiovascular disease represents the most common
cause of death in the United States.
 Hypertension and dyslipidemia have been well con-
trolled through primary prevention measures.
 An increasing prevalence of diabetes and obesity has
paralleled this decline.
 Validated cardiovascular risk prediction formulas
can estimate individual coronary risk.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
 Cardiovascular risk factors have changed at different
rates in the past 30 years.
 The net 10-year risk for incident cardiovascular
disease in the United States decreased significantly
from 1976­1980 to 1990­1994 but changed mini-
mally thereafter.
 Impact of diminishing change in risk is likely attribut-
able to slower improvements in lipid management and
smoking rates but probably due to the effect of an
increasing prevalence of diabetes and obesity.
Methods
Study Population
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
are 3 cross-sectional surveys representative of noninstitutionalized
people in the United States. The present analysis incorporated major
CV risk factors from NHANES II (1976­1980), NHANES III
(1988­1994), and NHANES 1999­2004, all collected in a standard-
ized manner. Detailed study design and sampling have been de-
scribed previously.24­30
Because our focus was to estimate the 10-year risk for incident CV
disease, we excluded people with a self-reported history of myocar-
dial infarction, angina, or stroke; pregnant women; people with
missing CV risk factor data; individuals 74 years as they were not
included in NHANES II; and subjects 30 years as the Framingham
score was not designed to assess risk in this age group. Of
participants with nonzero weights, we excluded 2310 participants of
a total of 9237 in NHANES II, 1800 participants of 11 137 from
NHANES III, and 1836 participants of 9702 from NHANES 1999­
2004. There were a total of 6927 participants, 9337 participants, and
7866 participants used from each respective survey in the risk
function. The subset of patients with fasting data included 3463
patients for NHANES II, 4494 from NHANES III, and 7866 from
NHANES 1999­2004. NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2004
underwent formal institutional review board approval, which in-
cluded a written informed consent. NHANES II did not have formal
institutional review in the manner in which it is defined currently.
This analysis obtained an exemption from the Institutional Review
Board as the data were deidentified in nature.
Measurements
Lipid analyses were conducted on frozen serum samples shipped on
dry ice to a central laboratory.31 Cholesterol measurements were
standardized according to the Centers for Disease Control­National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Lipid Standardization Program
criteria.31 We used different definitions of dyslipidemia depending of
the parameter used and history of treatment. High cholesterol was
defined as a measured total cholesterol (TChol) 240 mg/dL.
Dyslipidemia was defined as participants having a total cholesterol
(TChol) 240 mg/dL, or a high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL) 40 mg/dL in men or 50 mg/dL in women. Finally,
"Dyslipidemia with TG" included participants with a diagnosis of
dyslipidemia with a triglyceride (TG) level of 150 mg/dL whose
blood results were based on a morning subsample of blood. We also
classified participants according to the history of self-reported
dyslipidemia and treatment for it. These definitions paralleled those
outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult
Treatment Panel III guidelines.32
Plasma glucose was measured using the hexokinase enzymatic
method.13,33 Diabetes prevalence was defined as the sum of the
number or participants with self-reported diabetes on the whole
sample combined with those with glucose level 126 mg/dL on the
fasting morning subsample using methods of Flegal et al,34 and
termed "prevalent diabetes." This calculation includes variance
calculations using jackknife methods accounting for dependence
between the two samples.34,35 This definition of diabetes was based
on the most recent American Diabetes Association consensus state-
ment36 and was slightly different from the definition used in the
Framingham study,20 where the cutoff value for fasting glucose was
150 mg/dL. However, the CV risk associated with a fasting glucose
between 126 to 150 is very similar to the risk of glucose values just
above 150 mg/dL. Undiagnosed diabetes was defined as a fasting
glucose of 126 mg/dL36 and absence of self-reported diabetes.
Differences in blood pressure measurement protocol across the 3
surveys included the number of measurements, the qualifications of
the staff performing them, and whether it was measured in seated or
supine positions. We limited our analysis to sitting measurements.
The first measurement was excluded unless it was the only one
available, and the remaining measurements were averaged to con-
form to procedures used in NHANES 1999­2004. We defined
"history of hypertension" as a self-reported diagnoses of hyperten-
sion and defined "hypertension-measured" if systolic blood pressure
was 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure was 90 mm Hg,
regardless of the presence of self-reported hypertension or current
hypertension treatment. This was performed in line with the manner
the Framingham 10-year risk score incorporates blood pressure
values. This model does not differentiate between diagnosed versus
undiagnosed hypertension, or between those receiving treatment for
hypertension versus those untreated. We also analyzed the preva-
lence of treated hypertension.
Current smoking was defined as current cigarette, pipe, or cigar
smoker. Current cigarette smoking was defined if subjects answered
yes to both questions: "Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in
your entire life?" and "Do you smoke cigarettes now?" Current cigar
or pipe smoking was defined if participants smoked either type
"every day" or "some days." The NHANES definition of current
smoking was slightly different from the Framingham study,20 where
current smoking was defined as smoking regularly during the
previous 12 months.
Weight and height were measured by standard protocols. Body
mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing the weight in kilo-
grams by the square of height in meters. Obesity was defined as BMI
30kg/m2.
NHANES Data
Data and documentation for all surveys were downloaded in Sep-
tember/October 2006 from the NHANES website.37 Combined
sampling weights for NHANES 1999­2004 were created according
to guidelines.38 Age groups consisting of ages 30 to 40, 40 to 50, and
60 to 74 were defined for trend comparisons as recommended by
NHANES III.39

Coronary Heart Disease Risk Function
We used the Framingham formula20 to estimate the 10-year risk for
incident coronary disease, separately by sex, using age, TChol, HDL,
blood pressure (5 categories each), diabetes (yes/no), and smoking
(yes/no). The crude score was calculated based on the linear function
consisting of the sum of  coefficients and transformed into 10-year
predicted CV disease risk. The risk score was used in statistical tests
of change as it had a less skewed distribution than the 10-year risk
itself. CV risk was additionally calculated as if all members were 50
years old.
Analysis
We calculated weighted means, standard errors, and 95% confidence
limits using SAS-callable SUDAAN 9.0.1 to properly account for the
complex survey design. The NHANES examination sample weight
was used for most variables. The morning fasting sample weight was
used for the subsample with values for fasting glucose, low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and TGs. Triglyceride values were
converted to their natural log during the analyses because of the
considerable skewness of the variable.
Results were age­sex standardized by the direct method to the
actual results of the US Census 2000 population.40,41 We did not use
the Year 2000 age-adjustment weights that are commonly used in
mortality estimates, because these weights are based on the predicted
US population in year 2000 and not on actual values. The age groups
used for standardization were 30 to 40, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, and 60 to
74 years. This standardization also served to adjust for missing data
by age and sex. For trend analyses we used F tests. Our primary
outcome was the slope of change or rate of change per year between
NHANES II and III (first time period), and between NHANES III
and 1999­2004 (second time period). For each survey we used the
time frame between the midpoints to measure the elapsed time
between surveys, using 13 years as the average time between the first
2 surveys and 10.5 years between the last 2. The difference in slopes
was also calculated and compared to zero using a t test. A probability
value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The authors had
full access to the data and take responsibility for its integrity. All
authors have read and agree to the manuscript as written.
Results
The Table represents the general characteristics of partici-
pants during the 3 NHANES surveys, standardized to the US
2000 Census, and demonstrates the change in slope between
NHANES II and NHANES III and between NHANES III and
NHANES 1999­2004 and the difference between the slopes.
Figures 1 and 2 show the prevalence change in each of the 5
major CV risk factors over the course of the surveys.
Obesity
The prevalence of obesity rose during each time period, a
trend similar in both sexes. The mean BMI increased in all
age groups, as did the proportion with a BMI 30 kg/m2, but
the rate was higher in females than males. The rate of change
was similar in both time periods.
Hypertension
The prevalence of participants with an elevated blood pres-
sure (those defined as hypertension- measured) significantly
decreased over time, but the decrease was more significant in
the first time period than in the second period for the overall
cohort, in either sex and across all age groups. The proportion
of participants on antihypertensive medications increased
significantly over time. The mean values of systolic blood
pressure dropped in all age groups in the first time period but
increased slightly in period two. Detailed changes in blood
pressure values over time for the whole group and compari-
sons of slopes are listed in the Table. Values separated by sex
or age group are displayed in Appendix 1 and 2.
Hyperlipidemia
The mean TChol decreased during the first time period but
the mild decline in the second period did not reach statistical
significance, whereas LDL steadily decreased during both
periods. Mean HDL showed a modest increase over time, but
the slope was statistically significant only during the second
time period, in line with the significant rise in the use of
medications for dyslipidemia.42 Triglycerides had a nonsig-
nificant increase over both time periods and in all groups.
Changes over time in the prevalence of dyslipidemia using
different definitions and the corresponding slopes are listed in
the Table. Values separated by sex or age group are displayed
in Appendix 1 and 2.
Hyperglycemia and Diabetes
The rate of change for fasting glucose of all persons had a
positive slope in the first time period (P0.001), but in the
second time period the change was insignificant. These trends
were similar across sex and age groups. The rate of change
for the percent of participants with diabetes mellitus had
results parallel to those found for fasting glucose.
Smoking
The proportion of current smokers, cigarette, cigar, and pipe
smokers all decreased over time in both sexes and age groups.
The rate of change was more pronounced in the first time
period than in the second for the whole sample. Although the
proportion of 30- to 49- and 50- to 59-year-old cigar smokers
dropped in the first time period, there was a slight increase in
the rate of smokers in the second time period.
Cardiovascular Risk
The average age-adjusted 10-year CV risk between NHANES
II and NHANES III decreased from 10.0% to 7.9% with a
statistically significant slope (P0.001; Figure 3). However,
the average age-adjusted CV risk showed a smaller decrease
between NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2004 from 7.9%
to 7.4%, (P0.001). The slope between both periods was
significantly higher in the first time period than in the second.
(P0.001). Trends were nearly identical when data were
analyzed assuming that all participants were 50 years old.
When categorized by sex, CV disease risk in women
decreased between NHANES II and NHANES III (P0.001)
but did not change between NHANES III and NHANES
1999­2004 (P0.40). In contrast, men had a trend in CV risk
similar to the entire sample (Figure 4). People from 60 to 74
years of age were the only age group with a decrease in
predicted CV disease risk of similar magnitude in both time
periods (Figure 5). For other age groups, the predicted risk
decreased primarily between NHANES II and III but mini-
mally between NHANES III and 1999­2004. These trends
persisted in our sex-adjusted analysis and analysis of patients
assumed to be 50 years of age (data not shown).

Discussion
Our results, based on data from national surveys representa-
tive of the United States population, demonstrate that CV risk
factors have changed at different rates and directions in the
last 30 years. The net 10-year risk for incident CV disease in
the United States has significantly decreased from 1976­
1980 to 1990­1994, but has changed minimally thereafter. In
women, there was no change in the latter period. Our results
suggest that the stagnation of CV risk reduction can be
explained by the slower improvement in lipid parameters and
smoking rates, by the reversal of the trend in blood pressure
control, and probably by the effect of the increased preva-
lence in obesity-related CV risk factors.
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first
to calculate the trend in the net CV risk for developing CV
disease over the last 3 decades. This period of time is when
most evidence-based strategies for primary prevention of CV
disease have emerged and been widely implemented.17
These data have enormous public health implications, and
suggest that the gain in primary prevention of CV disease that
occurred from 1976­1980 to 1990­1994 has leveled off
during the last time period, despite the discovery and imple-
mentation of effective treatment modalities in managing
dyslipidemia and hypertension,8,32,43 national antismoking
campaigns,44 and efforts related to primordial prevention. Our
results also suggest that the lack of change of the net risk for
incidental symptomatic CV disease may be attributable to the
increased prevalence of obesity,10,11 which translates into a
higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus13,14 perhaps also con-
tributing to the reversal of the trend in blood pressure control

Slope values represent the rate of change between respective surveys (NHANES III versus II or NHANES 1999­2004 versus III). The slope difference represents
the difference between the 2 time periods. All slopes and slope differences are P0.001 unless indicated otherwise. The number of cigarette, cigar, and pipe smokers
may not add up to 100% because of patients who used multiple smoking modalities. The distribution of TGs were skewed, thus a natural log of triglycerides was
used for significance testing.
History of hypertension indicates self-reported diagnosis of hypertension; hypertension on medications, participants with a self-reported diagnosis of hypertension
and on anti-hypertensive medications; history of dyslipidemia diagnosed, participants with a self-reported diagnosis of dyslipidemia; dyslipidemia on medication,

and the slower improvement in lipid parameters. If the
obesity epidemic is sustained45 and smoking rates, blood
pressure, and lipid values continue with similar trajectories,
the net population CV risk can be expected to increase.
It is difficult to determine whether our results will translate
into a larger number of cardiovascular events in the United
States in the coming years. However, the predicted reduction
in the 10-year risk for incident CV disease from 1976­1980
to 1990­1994 shown in the present report was consistent with
the modest decrease in incident CV disease observed in
surveillance studies comparing CV disease rates between the
80s and the late 90s.46 This parallelism between the predicted
reduction in risk and the reduction in events 10 years later
adds validity to our results.
Several studies have assessed temporal changes in individ-
ual CV risk factors, and their results have been for the most
part similar to ours, despite the fact that our analysis was
limited to those without history of coronary disease or stroke
and excluded young adults or those older than 74
years.2,3,8,10,13,47 Our results confirm the previous observation
that the early declines in adult smoking rates might be
halted.3,4 This study also agrees with others demonstrating the
increased prevalence of cigar smoking in the last decade,45
which may explain the minimal reduction of overall smoking
during the latter period, compared to the first time period.
Hajjar commented in 2003 that the prevalence of hyper-
tension might be increasing despite a prior analysis from
NHANES, suggesting hypertension prevalence was declin-
ing.8 Our results support the concept that hypertension has
had a bidirectional trend over the last 30 years, manifested by
a decline in systolic blood pressure values from NHANES II
and NHANES III and a rise in these values between

of awareness and wider use of antihypertensive medications.
Other reports have described the secular trends in serum
lipids from 1960 to 2002, demonstrating that mean TChol and
LDL levels have steadily decreased without significant
changes in HDL and serum TG levels.2 Conversely, our
results illustrate a modest secular increase in HDL, particu-
larly between 1988­1994 to 1999­2004. Several factors may
have contributed to lipid parameter improvement, including
enhanced screening for dyslipidemia and higher use of
medications for dyslipidemia, which can decrease TChol and
LDL but also raise HDL. Dietary changes, particularly a
reduction in saturated fat intake with mild increases in
monounsaturated fat intake, may also explain the increase in
mean HDL. Because exercise levels have remained un-
changed,48,49 the modest improvement in HDL could not be
attributed to changes in physical activity.
Several studies have highlighted the increased prevalence
of diabetes mellitus since 1976, particularly diagnosed dia-
betes, with little change in the prevalence of undiagnosed
diabetes.13,50 Our analysis also shows a significant increase in
the average fasting blood plasma glucose levels over time,
suggesting that the increase in the prevalence of diabetes
mellitus reported elsewhere is not positively confounded
because of changes in diagnostic criteria.
The limitations of the current study relate primarily to the
intrinsic limitations of the NHANES surveys and that of the
Framingham prediction model. As in any survey, participa-
tion bias may have yielded a sample that is not entirely
representative of the population. However, specific to
NHANES is that the nationally represented population ex-
cluded participants residing in nursing facilities, members of
the armed forces, institutionalized participants, or nationals
living abroad. Hence, generalizing the results to these popu-
lations should be done with caution. The survey was designed
specifically to oversample certain subgroups of public health
interest to increase the reliability and precision of health
estimates for these groups. In addition, excluded patients may
have differed from those included in this study. Some
measurements may have differed by survey stage, and our
efforts to standardize values might not be able to create
identical variables. We acknowledge that many NHANES
variables, including those assessing CV disease, are self-
reported and may lead to reporting bias. The definitions of
diabetes and current smoking in the Framingham study were
slightly different than the definitions used in the current
analysis. Finally, although the Framingham risk score was
developed for people with no history of CV disease, a small
fraction of the total sample might have failed to report history
of CV disease and were included in the current analysis.
Although several of these limitations may hamper the validity
of risk estimates in each NHANES survey, these potential
sources of bias and error were present in the three surveys.
Therefore, the comparison of trends in risk may be less
affected than the individual risk estimates.
Our analysis has several strengths. Contrary to other
reports addressing the change in several CV risk factors, we
used widely validated risk scores to predict the risk of
incident symptomatic CV disease. By measuring the net
change in CV risk, we can better estimate the global impact
of preventive strategies, particularly when certain risk factors
improve, others do not change, and others worsen during the
same time period. NHANES data were obtained using a
prospective methodology with standardized measurements
and definitions, and are known to be representative of the US
population. Risk functions derived from NHANES data have
accurately projected the extent of CV events and overall
mortality even in other population groups.51,52 Furthermore,
only 1 other study has evaluated the change in CV risk among
United States adults but only used 2 NHANES surveys, and
relied on the risk model adopted by the National Cholesterol
Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III and not the
precise Framingham formula in estimating overall CV dis-
ease risk, and their results were not age-stratified.53
The Framingham risk score does not account for risk
factors such as family history of premature coronary disease,
exercise, diet, obesity, or body fat distribution. Nevertheless,
at the time the scoring system was developed, exercise,
obesity, and diet were believed to impact and mediate CV risk
through factors already included in the model. Hence, our
findings may actually be conservative risk estimates, as the
increasing prevalence of obesity may have led to higher CV
risk, not only mediated through commonly recognized car-
diac risk factors, but also via obstructive sleep apnea, high
leptin and low adiponectin levels, and changes in other
inflammatory cytokines and adipokines linked with central
obesity.54 Additionally, the Framingham risk score was cre-
ated to help clinicians identify patients at high risk for CV
disease, and therefore simplicity has been a priority even if

that requires sacrificing a small incremental predictive value
with the use of the other risk factors.
The Framingham risk score was derived from a community
sample of white subjects, whereas the population included in
NHANES overrepresents minorities. The validity of Fra-
mingham and other scores predicting CV disease has been
tested in diverse populations and shown different event rates
for any given estimated risk value. Although this weakness
has been addressed and can be partially corrected by doing
appropriate calibration,21 the validity of the overall estimated
risk may be limited. Moreover, CV risk prediction rules can
help to predict changes in event rates after changes in
different CV risk factors occur. For example, in an analysis
showing the change in predicted CV risk in a sample of
patients who underwent bariatric surgery,51,55 the predicted
reduction of cardiovascular events was very close to the risk
reduction subsequently reported in a prospective cohort of
people who underwent bariatric surgery.52 It has also been
shown that the use of risk factor categories provides similar
prognostic information as using noncategorical prediction
functions. The score uses blood pressure and lipid values
regardless of history of diagnosis or medical treatment for
hypertension or dyslipidemia, respectively. Blood pressure
and cholesterol values regardless of use of medications better
capture the impact of public health and clinical factors that
may change over time, and are also less susceptible to recall
bias than definitions based on treatment status. The prognos-
tic performance of Framingham could affect the absolute risk
estimates but not the trend over time because the same
limitations will apply to the 3 time periods. Therefore, our
main findings and conclusions are not hampered by the
limitations inherent to the Framingham risk score.
In conclusion, our study has shown that the estimated net
risk for CV disease in the United States population decreased
from 1976­1980 to 1988­1994, but has changed minimally
from 1988­1994 to 1999­2004. The net CV risk has re-
mained unchanged in women from 1988 to 1994. Cardiovas-
cular risk reduction has been maintained in patients aged 60
or greater, but the difference in risk reduction observed from
NHANES II and III has been minimal in younger people,
especially among those age 30 to 39. The increase in the
prevalence of diabetes and in blood pressure levels may
explain the staggering of the risk reduction from NHANES
III to NHANES 1999­2004. Because obesity may predispose
to diabetes mellitus14 and can aggravate systemic blood
pressure and dyslipidemia, the attenuation in risk reduction
can be at least partially attributed to the growing epidemic.
However, other factors like the attenuation in the reduction of
prevalent smoking and cholesterol control observed in the
second time period compared to the first one might also
explain the results. These results reinforce the need for
aggressive community-wide and office-based promotion of
primordial prevention, with emphasis on physical activity,
exercise, dietary changes aiming for a higher intake of fruits
and vegetables, lower intake of salt and saturated fat, main-
tenance of a healthy weight and smoking control. These
results also underscore the key role of health care providers
managing CV risk factors. These findings also confirm that
the discovery and use of effective medications for lipids and
blood pressure do not translate into global risk reduction,
unless they are paired with strategies preventing the occur-
rence of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia and reduc-
ing the rates of new smokers.

Slope values represent the rate of change between respective surveys (NHANES III vs. II or NHANES IV vs. III). The slope difference represents
the difference between the two time periods. All slopes and slope differences are p < 0.001 unless indicated otherwise. * ­ P<0.05;  ­ P>0.05. The
number of cigarette, cigar and pipe smokers may not add up to 100% due to patients who used multiple smoking modalities. The distribution of
triglycerides were skewed thus a natural log of triglycerides was used for significance testing. There were too few entries to properly test
significance for female pipe smokers.

|| ­ data was not available from NHANES II
# - based on 3,463 patients from NHANES II, 4,494 from NHANES III, and 7,866 from NHANES 1999-2004
Definitions:
History of Hypertension - Self-reported diagnosis of hypertension
Hypertension on Medications - Participants with a self-reported diagnosis of hypertension and on anti-hypertensive medications

History of Dyslipidemia Diagnosed, % - Participants with a self-reported diagnosis of dyslipidemia
Dyslipidemia on Medication, % - Participants with a Total Cholesterol 240 or an HDL 40 in males or 50 in females on medications.
High Cholesterol - measured, % - Participants with a total cholesterol 240
Dyslipidemia - Participants with either a total cholesterol 240 or an HDL 40 in males or 50 in females
Dyslipidemia with TG - Participants with a total cholesterol 240 or an HDL 40 in males or 50 in females and a TG 150, only in the
sample of participants with a morning subsample
Diabetes ­ based on participants with self-reported diabetes and/or a fasting glucose level 126mg/dL
Total Diabetes ­ morning sample ­ prevalence on subsample of participants with only fasting blood glucoses
Undiagnosed Diabetes ­ participants with a fasting glucose 126mg/dL and the absence of self-reported diabetes
Current Smoker ­ Participants currently smoking cigarettes, cigars, or pipes
Cigarette Smoker ­ Participants currently smoking and that have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime
Slope values represent the rate of change between respective surveys (NHANES III vs. II or NHANES IV vs. III). The slope difference represents
the difference between the two time periods. All slopes and slope differences are p < 0.001 unless indicated otherwise. * ­ P<0.05;  ­ P>0.05. The
number of cigarette, cigar and pipe smokers may not add up to 100% due to patients who used multiple smoking modalities. The distribution of
triglycerides were skewed thus a natural log of triglycerides was used for significance testing. There were too few entries to properly test
significance for female pipe smokers.
