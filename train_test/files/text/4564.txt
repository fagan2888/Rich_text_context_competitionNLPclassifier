Special Issue - Student Diversity
The neoliberal economic policies of the past 25 years have
culminated in increased poverty rates and income inequality
(Coburn, 2004). These policies include deregulation of pri-
vate industry, privatization, and decreased public expendi-
tures for safety net services and social service sectors such
as education and health care, inevitably shaping individual
views on causes and solutions to the social problem of
poverty.
In 2014, the United States Department of Health and
Human Services (USDHHS) set the poverty threshold for a
family of four at $23,850. An impoverished family of four
has just $1,987 a month to pay for housing, food, transporta-
tion, and utilities, among other costs (USDHHS, 2014).
Many families at this income level work jobs that lack ben-
efits and health insurance. They often live in substandard
housing and many are just one crisis away from becoming
homeless. Furthermore, the social problem of poverty
impacts and impedes individuals' ability to lead healthy and
productive lives--impacting health and mental health out-
comes, exposure to violence, access to services, and poten-
tial for social mobility (Seccombe, 2000, 2002).
Current Population Survey Annual Social Economic
Supplement (CPS ASEC) 2013 findings indicate that indi-
viduals and families living below the poverty level com-
prised 14.5% of the U.S. population with 45.3 million people
living in poverty (DeNavas-Walt & Proctor, 2014). In the
county where this study was conducted, 10.1% of families
and 13.6% of all individuals reported having an income at or
below poverty level with only 9.8% receiving food stamps or
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) bene-
fits (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). In addition, compared with
the 50 most populous cities in the United States, the south-
eastern city in which this study was conducted was recently
rated as having the lowest social mobility with only 4.4% of
children born in the bottom fifth income level likely to move
to the top fifth income level during their lifetime (Chetty,
Hendren, Kline, & Saez, 2014).
This inability of a person to move up the economic ladder
highlights tremendous racial and socioeconomic disparities
in the region--factors which inhibit the ability of many indi-
viduals and families to reach goals of higher education and/
or move out of poverty (Chetty et al., 2014; U.S. Census
Bureau, 2010). As the only premiere urban research univer-
sity in the region, it is the responsibility of the university to
increase access and inclusion of community members of dif-
fering socioeconomic status.

Teaching Strategies for Addressing
Poverty Awareness With Aspiring
Helping Professionals
Othelia Eun-Kyoung Lee1 and Mary Ann Priester2
Abstract
This study describes the use of guided learning activities that exposed aspiring helping professionals to the challenges and
discrimination experienced by individuals living in poverty. Pretest/posttest and qualitative analysis of participants' reactions
to a Poverty Simulation and a Bridges Out of Poverty Workshop were analyzed to explore perceived learning benefits
reported by 43 master of social work (MSW) students. Incorporating poverty content into masters-level social work
curriculum stimulated classroom discussions about how the lived experiences of individuals living in poverty impact the
service relationship between helping professionals and clients. This observational study evaluated the effectiveness of the
used strategies and methods in impacting individual assumptions about socioeconomic class and illustrated the value of
university­community collaborations in supporting diversity education and awareness both on and off campus.

Poverty-aware practice is advocacy and service provi-
sion that is grounded in an understanding of the centrality of
poverty in the lives of those who experience it and acknowl-
edge the intersection of poverty with other marginalized
identities (Davis & Wainwright, 2005; Krumer-Nevo,
Weiss-Gal, & Monnickendam, 2009). It also includes aware-
ness of how living in poverty impacts the human experience
at the individual-, micro-, mezzo-, exo-, and macro-systems
levels. Rehner, Ishee, Salloum, and Velasques (1997) sug-
gest that a helping professionals' attitude about poverty
impacts how they provide services, interact with their cli-
ents, choose interventions, and make referrals. To illustrate,
a non-structural view of poverty increases the likelihood that
helping professionals will be unsupportive, un-empathetic,
and unable to challenge policy and organizational culture to
best serve individuals living in poverty. These findings sug-
gest that levels of poverty awareness impact helping profes-
sionals' interactions and practice with individuals living in
poverty.
Despite the broad impact of poverty, master of social
work (MSW) programs have failed to adopt poverty curricu-
lum to ensure poverty-aware practice (Davis & Wainwright,
2005). Protecting vulnerable and marginalized populations is
a core value of the social work profession yet poverty aware-
ness curriculum has not been a priority. A survey of the cur-
riculum of 50 top social work schools found that only 12
offered more than one course on the topic of poverty
(Harding, Ferguson, & Radey, 2005). Consequently, MSW
students may overestimate the financial resources that
impoverished individuals receive from benefits such as food
stamps and welfare or minimum wage jobs (Ljubotina &
Ljubotina, 2007; Rosenthal, 1993). Even though social work-
ers make these acknowledgments, they fail to see themselves
as agents of change whose role is to address the social ill of
poverty (Davis & Wainwright, 2005).
Moreover, there is limited research on the role of graduate
education in determining if future helping professionals view
the cause of poverty from a cultural/behavioral or structural
lens. MSW students who took a higher number of social
work courses perceive causal factors associated with poverty
to be related to societal factors such as situational or institu-
tional factors that privilege some groups over others such as
race, gender, class, and so on (Jordan, 2004). Gasker and
Vafeas (2003) found social work students who had taken a
social welfare course were more likely than students who
had not to attribute poverty to structural factors and less
likely to attribute causes of poverty to the characteristics of
the individual (e.g., behavioral or cultural attributes). Yun
and Weaver (2010) had similar findings reporting that of two
groups of students with similar demographic characteristics,
those who took a course that focused on the topics of food
poverty policy, homelessness, and challenges faced by
impoverished individuals were more likely to view poverty
from a structural context than students who enrolled in a
business class focused on the global economy.
Stigma is the devaluation of an individual based on his or
her social identity; poverty stigma is the devaluation of an
individual or group of individuals based on their financial
standing (Reutter et al., 2009). In tandem with neoliberal
economic policies, the neoliberal discourse in relation to
poverty has characterized poverty as a result of individual
failure and/or lack of competency (Beddoe & Keddell, 2016).
Although reduction of stigma is in alignment with the social
justice mission of social work, such discourse and policies
may influence social work student perspectives about factors
associated with poverty thereby influencing social work
practice with individuals experiencing poverty (Beddoe &
Keddell, 2016; Scheyett, 2005). Failure to acknowledge or
address such stigma has scoping implications, as stigma is
associated with social exclusion and exacerbates the impact
of poverty (Crocker, Major, & Steele, 1998).
Educators have made a myriad of suggestions about com-
ponents of poverty training that should be integrated into
social work curriculum, ranging from courses focusing on
social justice to decrease the fatalistic view of poverty to
experiential learning exercises that require students to live at
poverty level or apply for welfare benefits (Harding et al.,
2005). Krumer-Nevo and colleagues (2009) have developed
a conceptual framework for the integration of poverty-aware
curriculum in social work education. This framework con-
sists of four major themes: (a) theoretical knowledge acqui-
sition, (b) practical knowledge acquisition, (c) acquisition of
practical experience, and (d) development of self-reflection
capabilities (Krumer-Nevo et al., 2009). The use of the
framework has yet to be implemented on a broad scale and
effectiveness of the framework in impacting social work stu-
dents'attitudes about poverty or practice behaviors has yet to
be studied. To that end, this study incorporates the poverty-
aware curriculum themes of theoretical knowledge acquisi-
tion and development of self-reflection capabilities. The
poverty series provided students with opportunities to reflect
upon their own ideologies and attitudes about poverty. This
study, in part, aims to examine the effectiveness of these
strategies in enhancing poverty awareness among social
work students.
Methods
Poverty Series
The poverty series consisted of three events: a poverty simu-
lation exercise, an adapted version of the Bridges Out of
Poverty workshop, and a community conversation about pov-
erty. The purpose of the poverty series was to provide campus
and community members with meaningful experiences and
tools to integrate into their classrooms, neighborhoods, agen-
cies, and community interactions. Community partnerships
were solicited to facilitate activities to enhance awareness
about issues facing individuals living in poverty. The authors
cultivated partnerships with the local Crisis Assistance
Lee and Priester 3
Ministry to host the poverty simulation, with the Urban
Ministry Center to host the Bridges Out of Poverty educa-
tional activity, and with local homelessness advocacy groups
and school systems to promote and host a community conver-
sation on poverty experiences of individuals and families.
Poverty simulation.Forty-eight MSW students and 32 com-
munity members participated in a poverty simulation
designed to help participants begin to understand what it
might be like to live in a typical low-income family. This
experiential workshop lasted 3 hr and included an introduc-
tion, the simulation exercise, and a debriefing period in
which participants and volunteers shared their reactions and
experiences to the exercise. Resources were shared to help
participants gain further knowledge about the concepts pre-
sented during the simulation.
A large room in a student center was transformed into a
community with various service providers and vendors
including a food bank, utility company offices, pawnshops,
and other businesses and organizations. Participants were
split into families of various sizes, income levels, and per-
sonal and financial responsibilities. During the simulation,
the families were responsible for feeding themselves, paying
their bills, caring for dependent children and aging or dis-
abled family members, and going to work or school.
Bridge Out of Poverty (referred to as "Bridge"). The Bridge was
a half-day workshop focused on understanding and counter-
acting poverty and its effects and was attended by 43 MSW
students. Based on models developed by Payne, DeVol, and
Smith (2007), participants were encouraged to create a men-
tal model of poverty, review poverty research, examine a
theory of change, and analyze poverty through the prism of
the hidden rules of class, resources, family structure, and lan-
guage. The Bridge workshop provided participants with an
understanding of class differences and common assumptions
we make about people different from us. The workshop
explored poverty from the perspective of individuals and
families and provided strategies and tools that individuals/
communities can use to address the pervasive problem of
poverty.
Community conversation. The third event, a community con-
versation about child homelessness, consisted of the screen-
ing of the documentary Homeless: The Motel Kids of Orange
County, followed by a panel discussion that was open to the
public and was attended by 189 people. The community
panel, which consisted of local school system social work-
ers, service providers for homeless children, and faculty with
a research focus on homelessness, acknowledged that there
are many children and families affected by poverty and
homelessness in the local community. The panel spoke about
the barriers local homeless families face in exiting homeless-
ness, local resources to address these barriers, and the prob-
lem of child/family homelessness in general. The discussion
also addressed the systemic nature of social issues such as
living wage rates, social fragmentation, and the need for
advocacy, education, and greater individual awareness to
address social issues.
Participants and Data Collection
The experiential learning activities of the poverty series were
integrated with a macro-practice theory course that focused
on the impact of organizations, communities, and social
institutions and was taught by the first author. The focal point
of each activity was to address and explore individual
assumptions about socioeconomic status and how those
assumptions intersect with a variety of diversity issues, most
notably race, ethnicity, and social class.
This research study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board for Research With Human Subjects at the
research team's university. MSW students were strongly
encouraged to participate in both the poverty simulations and
the workshops. Students were informed that their participa-
tion and feedback would not impact their course grade.
Respondents were informed that data from the survey would
be used to help develop an understanding of the impact that
each type of event has on changing individual assumptions
about socioeconomic status, as well as identify areas of
improvement and focus for future diversity projects. Due to
a scheduling conflict, only a few MSW students were able to
attend this Community Conversation event. Hence, the study
sample reported here is limited to 43 MSW students who
attended both the poverty simulation and Bridge workshop
(89.6% response rate).
Measures
A questionnaire was designed consisting of poverty-related
measures, attitudinal items, and standard demographic char-
acteristics. A modified version of the Beliefs About Poverty
Scale (Smith & Stone, 1989) was used to assess attributions
of poverty. Participants were asked to indicate the impor-
tance of 12 explanations for the causes of the "problems of
poor people" on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 = not important, 5 =
very important). Seven items of the original scale contained
explicit, judgmental language, stating that poor people are
"dishonest," "dirty," "lazy," and have "lower intelligence."
As these items may not be applicable to measure social work
students' attitudes and are subject to social desirability bias,
they were excluded.
The factors that represented the constructs of interest
were (a) Individualism, or the belief that individuals are
"responsible for their status in a system of social inequality,"
and (b) Structuralism/Situationalism, or the belief that "dis-
proportionately restrictive social structures do not provide
equal alternatives for all people" (Smith & Stone, 1989,
p. 95). A high score on the Individualism subscale indicates
that the participant assigns causal responsibility for one's
4 SAGE Open
poverty to individuals rather than systems, society, or social
structures. A high score on the Structuralism/Situationalism
subscale indicates that the participant assigns responsibility
for the problems of people living in poverty to society or
structural systems. Factor analyses by Yun and Weaver
(2010) identified a third factor, namely, Stigma associated
with poverty. This is particularly relevant for the sample of
social work students.
Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to report sociodemographic
profiles of the poverty series event participants (see Table 1).
Analyses of mean scores and paired t tests were conducted to
examine any statistically significant change after the Poverty
Simulation and Bridge workshop in MSW students' beliefs
and attitudes (Table 2).
Additionally, qualitative content analysis was conducted
on MSW student reflection posts on an online discussion
forum. To analyze this qualitative data, the authors used open
coding derived from the grounded theory approach to exam-
ine the learning benefits reported by social work students
(Glaser & Strauss, 1967). While reading (and re-reading) the
text line-by-line, categories were generated through the
"emic" process to capture experiences from the individual's
point of view (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005, p. 12). The interpre-
tation was driven by themes that emerged from the data to
guide the description of how poverty was understood and
experienced by poverty series event participants.
Findings
Poverty Simulation
MSW students who completed the questionnaires had the
following demographic distributions (rounded to the nearest
percent): 91% were female; 67% were White, 23% African
Americans, 5% Asian American, and 3% Native Americans;
74% were in their 20s, 19% in their 30s, and 7% in their 40s.
After the poverty simulation, participants were asked to
share one word they thought captured their experience.
Frequently mentioned responses were "frustrated," "desper-
ate," "exhausted," "hectic," and "overwhelmed." Positive
reactions also included descriptions such as "interesting,"
"informative," "insightful," and "eye-opening" about the kind
of struggles that clients have to face. One learner reported,
This was an invaluable educational experience that changed my
perspective. I was completely obliviousness to the realities
poverty places on the lives of individuals and families. I never
realized how impossible it was to escape poverty until I assumed
the role of an individual in this situation.
The poverty simulation experience helped participants
begin to understand what it might be like to live in a typical
low-income family. Students expressed appreciation of the
experiential learning opportunity. One student said, "It's one
thing to read about living in poverty, but experiencing it
gives you a whole new perspective." Another reiterated the
sentiment stating, "Seeing my clients experience it and hear-
ing the group mention it today . . . I took a step back. I've just
never thought about it."
Our content analysis indicated that four major themes
emerged from students' reflections postsimulation: (a) roles
in the family, (b) a new understanding of stress and negative
social behaviors, (c) difficult choices, and (d) implications
for professional relationships.
Roles in the family. Participants assumed roles of 26 different
families facing poverty. Roles included newly unemployed,
"breadwinner" recently deserted, Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families (TANF) recipients, individuals with disabili-
ties/senior citizens receiving Social Security, among others.
Students' comments included their own reflection on taking
a particular role in the family. Almost all students were able
to put themselves in the shoes of each family member and

speak from the perspectives of these assigned roles. Consid-
ering that over a half of students (58%) self-identified with
working-class or lower-class families, they appeared to be
very enthusiastic in empathizing with low-income families.
The task for each family was to obtain/maintain food,
shelter, and basic necessities during four 15-min weeks while
balancing the requirements of various service providers with
the realities of daily life. A student who played a 9-year-old
girl raised by a grandmother described,
From a child's perspective I got to feel exactly how it felt to be
ignored by my caregivers who were preoccupied with providing
for the family. It is understandable that neglect is the highest
form of abuse. Coming from an Education background, it
brought back memories that many struggled with [Attentional
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorders], a learning disability, or a
mental health issue. Just like in today's simulation, several of
my [child] clients' parents could not afford medications and it
gravely affected their children's work and classroom experience.
Another student who played a father and breadwinner for a
family of four recalled,
I was laid off during the third week. If you are the only one
working and the family depends on you, what do you do? You
can't have a pity party and you have to figure out different ways
to make ends meet.
One student played a role of a father and husband con-
cerned about his lack of engagement and connection with
his family: "As the sole worker in the home, I found it frus-
trating that I didn't know a lot about what was going on
with my family. At the end of each week, some additional
stressor had befallen our family."Another student expressed
that family engagement and involvement was secondary to
meeting the basic needs of the family: "I spent most of my
time working or running errands. I would only hear small
bits about what was going on with my daughter. Life is tough
when you have no choice but to miss important milestones."
Participants often found they did not have enough money or
time to fulfill all of their obligations: They were required to
face difficult challenges such as lack of transportation and
having only enough money to pay for food or rent.
Enhanced understanding of stress and negative social behaviors.
The second theme is related to daily stress encountered by
impoverished families and related social behaviors. With
regard to their family's financial strain, a student reflected,
I was the only one working a low-income job. My income was
spent on mortgage and utilities during the second and third
week, and then on food and miscellaneous items the 4th week.
My family was living paycheck to paycheck with some
assistance from food stamps, my father-in-law's disability
check, and my daughter's part-time job.
Another student who played a housewife developed gained
insight regarding childcare-related stress and its effects on
employment challenges experienced by her clients:

One of the clients I work with has been struggling trying to
locate a job and care for her daughter and her boyfriend's sons.
Her grandmother will watch her daughter but not her boyfriend's
children, so she has had to turn down two jobs.
Some students gained a better understanding of "learned
helplessness" and the feeling of being "stuck": "Experiencing
[service provider's] lack of empathy for my hardships made
me feel frustrated, like no one cared. I was so desperate to
make ends meet that I began stealing without remorse."
Narrative data revealed students' understanding of nega-
tive social behaviors (e.g., robbery, steeling, revenge, etc.) as
a consequence of stress associated with poverty.
Several participants admitted that they resorted to stealing
to make ends meet. One remarked, "It was interesting how
quickly I sought revenge when I was robbed. I bought a gun
and began planning my revenge. I can see how robbery would
be a real issue for someone in dire straits."Another said, "Even
kids were stealing money or whatever they could to help their
own families." One student expressed remorse for having to
engage in negative social behavior: "I am sorry that my wife
stole your money. We needed cash for my mother-in-law to get
her prescription medicine. That does not excuse what we did."
Reflecting on how the simulation captured the reality of
poverty, students concurred that it was as real as it could be.
One student stated, "It is no wonder that consumers and their
families feel as stressed as they do. It is not a poor work ethic
that has led to their life circumstances; it is a lack of access
to resources."
Difficult choices.Participants seemed to be in accord about
lessons learned about difficult choices that individuals/fami-
lies living in poverty face. For example, a student who
learned that seniors on fixed incomes often must choose
between buying medicine or food remarked, "These individ-
uals have to work hard just to make it through 1 month.
There's always a trade-off; if they choose to do one thing,
they must neglect another."
Another student described the consequences of these dif-
ficult choices: "At one point, I had to choose between keeping
our refrigerator or robbing someone to pay our bills. In the
end, our bills were cut off." The simulation allowed students
to observe how difficult it can be for families to survive, rein-
forcing the realities of living in poverty. One student stated,
Many of our clients work harder to make ends meet than many
of us. I stress about the extras and they stress about the basics. I
think that this experience helped to show that the work ethic is
not lacking in the working poor. They deserve our respect and
admiration.
The poverty simulation led students to rethink the trade-offs
that low-income families have to make. For example, lack of
transportation limited some individual's ability to go to
work, seek child care or other services, and/or shop for their
family:
Finally, it struck me that much of the stress was related to
transportation. I thought about the number of hours people wait
for buses with small children. Much of the week is spent waiting.
We don't give our clients the credit they deserve.
Implications for professional relations. Social work students in
this study were sensitized to the challenges low-income peo-
ple experience while navigating the complex service sys-
tems. Students shared their frustration about receiving
services and what it was like to ask for help. One learner
stated, "This simulation makes you more aware of the strug-
gles our clients face. Social worker's overwhelming casel-
oads and other things contribute to our attitude toward
clients. I will be more mindful of my clients struggle in the
future." Another offered,
I have always been empathetic to those who struggle paycheck
to paycheck but experiencing what they go through was helpful
in understanding their frustration. Navigating the system and
worrying about how you will keep your family afloat is too
much to handle sometimes.
Some students also appreciated the opportunity for peer
learning. One student shared,
It was interesting to see how people started to network among
themselves instead of going to the agencies first. People only
sought help when they were desperate. It is important for social
workers to realize where clients are at and the stress that they are
handling when they reach our office.
Another student who had previously attended a poverty
simulation reflected that "repeating the simulation again
opened my eyes to poverty on a larger scale. I gained a better
awareness each time about poverty and how it affects indi-
viduals in the community." Finally, a student speculated
about the utility of administering the poverty simulation to
high school students: "The exercise would give them insight
into how difficult it is to manage basic life. It might encour-
age some students to make different choices."
Bridges Out of Poverty Workshop
Qualitative analyses of reactions to the Bridges Out of
Poverty Workshop were similar to student responses from
the poverty simulation. However, the workshop had the
added dimensions of focusing on the middle-class perspec-
tive and how the psychosocial stress response to poverty
impacts behavior, skills, decision-making, and generational
poverty.
One student offered, "The [bridge] workshop really made
me understand the way the middle class sees the world com-
pared with those in poverty. For examples, the way we think
about money, relationships, and even social emphasis."
Another stated, "[The workshop] offered more insight into
how there is a different mentality and set of skills that are
Lee and Priester 7
required and developed in order to survive in poverty." While
still others noted that the workshop changed their view about
low-income individuals' willingness to take action to change
their situation:
Yes, it helped me to see the stress involved and how you get
caught in the present trying to survive. [The workshop] changed
my expectations about client's planning for the future and
thinking of consequences . . . It also changed my idea that if they
really wanted to they could improve their life.
At the end of the workshop, students discussed whether
they had a perceptible change of attitude about what life
might be like for their clients. The content analysis of stu-
dents' online discussion board posts revealed that the work-
shop as well as class discussion inspired empathy,
understanding, and a greater ability to strive for social
change. First, students appreciated knowledge gained with
one participant stating as follows: "The workshop opened
my eyes to a lot of the underlying stereotypes and beliefs that
I have about poverty and individuals who are poor and helped
me to see many things in a different light."
Second, students reported developing a new understand-
ing of social class. One learner commented,
I became aware of the hidden rules that affect how members of
each socioeconomic class respond to the world. As a middle-
class member, most of my time is devoted to work, achievement,
and material security, and this notion was directly linked to this
perspective. I also became aware of the family patterns and
values of generational poverty. I was able to understand, find
meaning, and connect with the identified cultural-elements of
families in generational poverty.
Further, the workshop enabled some students to reflect on
their own thinking and behaviors based on their social class.
One participant shared, "Sometimes I'll even catch myself
thinking something and say "Wow, J. [student's name], that's
very middle-class thinking of you." Another stated,
[This workshop] enlightened us to the fact that regardless of our
conscious thoughts, we still operate out of our personal idioms.
It can take considerable effort to understand our client's
viewpoints unless we can let go of some of ours.
Overall, the poverty simulation and workshop helped stu-
dents to see poverty from varied perspectives, examine their
own biases about individuals living in poverty, and identify
challenges to escaping poverty. Some students acknowl-
edged that one of the most difficult things about living in
poverty is being judged. One participant stated, "I also real-
ized how challenging and stigmatizing it is for someone to
receive government services and other service providers."
After participating in the simulation, students discussed a
hope that participants took away a better understanding of
people living in poverty and won't be so quick to judge
individuals living in poverty in the future. One African
American student reflected,
The workshop helped me to see how I have judged other African
Americans more harshly for not finding a way out of poverty,
especially members of my family. I had always thought that
because I was able to get away from poverty that they should be
able to easily do the same if they really wanted to. This led me
to feel that poor people were unmotivated or lazy.
The posttest of the Beliefs About Poverty questionnaire
was conducted at the end of the Bridge workshop. Results of
a paired t test indicated that 43 MSW students who partici-
pated in both the poverty simulation and the Bridge work-
shop reported significant changes on three items, one from
each of the three subscales. Within the individualism factor,
learners' beliefs about different sets of values presented by
low-income families were improved (t = -.4.78, p < .001).
Within the Structuralism subscale, student willingness to
support social programs for poor people was significantly
improved (t = -2.65, p < .01). Among the stigma factors,
students' negative attitudes toward welfare recipients were
improved (t = 2.38, p < .05).
Discussion
This observational study evaluated the effectiveness of teach-
ing strategies and methods in impacting individual assump-
tions about socioeconomic class and to illustrate the value of
university­community collaborations in supporting diversity
education and awareness both on and off campus. Findings
revealed that the poverty series helped students to enhance
their understanding of the financial pressure, emotional strain,
and difficult choices faced by families with living in poverty.
Such understanding may encourage these students to rethink
the positive and negative impacts that professionals can make
in the lives of families with low resources.
Via this experiential learning, students reported increased
empathy for clients who experience poverty-related stigma,
acknowledging that individual factors influencing client situ-
ations may contribute to a negative self-image and decreased
levels of personal agency to improve their situation. By par-
ticipating in the Bridges workshop, MSW students were
exposed to a framework through which individuals can take
action to address poverty on an individual, community, and
systems levels. This resulted in improved attitude toward
welfare recipients and willingness to support welfare pro-
gram. The Community Conversation on child homelessness
provided participants with knowledge about the differential
impact of implications of social phenomena on individuals
living in poverty.
Applying the framework of theoretical knowledge acqui-
sition and development of self-reflection capabilities
(Krumer-Nevo et al., 2009), each activity enhanced partici-
pants' understanding of the culture of poverty, provided an
8 SAGE Open
outlet for them to reflect on their own class status, and provided
them with insight into the lens through which they view indi-
viduals who have a socioeconomic status different from their
own. Hence, part of becoming poverty aware is not only acquir-
ing knowledge about causal factors related to poverty but also
about associated factors related to the stigmatization of poverty
and the impact of such stigma on the individual.
Our findings align with previous research, which indi-
cates that educated social work students are more likely to
view the cause of poverty as structural in nature (Davis &
Wainwright, 2005; Reutter et al., 2009). As evidenced by
survey data and qualitative feedback, both the poverty simu-
lation and the Bridges Out of Poverty workshop helped to
educate social work students about the realities of the pov-
erty and social justice locally and nationally (Jordan, 2004).
This study has important study limitations that merit atten-
tion. With regard to the validity of the modified Beliefs About
Poverty scale (Smith & Stone, 1989), an obvious deficiency is
that the scales use self-report and the items are relatively trans-
parent. The students could respond with what they think to be
professionally and socially acceptable responses. Further, this
study was conducted with MSW students and may not be gen-
eralizable to all graduate students. Findings of this study
should be interpreted in light of the study's limitations.
In spite of these limitations, the poverty series provided
MSW students with the opportunity for personal reflection,
group discussion, and coordinated action. Particularly, our
active outreach and partnership with community agencies is
in alignment with higher education goals of external collabo-
ration to support diversity both on campus and in the com-
munity. Our innovative community collaboration model is
consistent with the University's goal of institutional and
community leadership in effectively addressing issues of
diversity, access, and inclusion.
Finally, the Community Conversation event was able to
engage a vast cross-section of community members includ-
ing currently and formerly homeless individuals, faculty, stu-
dents, service providers, and local government officials.
While data from this event were excluded from the analysis,
anecdotally, attendees of the event expressed gaining a
greater understanding of the impact of programming for chil-
dren experiencing homelessness through the client stories
provided by the social workers and service providers.
Future series of community-engaged learning experi-
ences should target campus and community members more
broadly to provide more collaborative and diverse learning
environments. Furthermore, future research should evaluate
perceived learning benefits for this type of learning experi-
ence and the role of such community-engaged learning
strategies in enhancing topical knowledge across commu-
nity subpopulations.
