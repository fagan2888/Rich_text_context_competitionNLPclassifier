Abstract
Objectives: To investigate the co-prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and carotid
stenosis and to determine predictors related to CAD in Chinese patients with paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation (PAF), presenting without previously diagnosed or excluded CAD.
Methods: Consecutive patients with PAF were recruited. CAD was evaluated using multislice
computed tomography. Intima­media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery was evaluated via
ultrasonography.
Results: A total of 62/192 (32.3%) patients had CAD. Carotid stenosis was observed in 26/192
(13.5%) patients. The co-prevalence of carotid stenosis and CAD was 7.8% (15/192). The
prevalence of carotid stenosis was 8.5%, 16.7%, 25.0%, and 41.7% in patients with zero-, one-, two-,
and three-vessel CAD, respectively. Diabetes mellitus, maximal IMT and hyperhomocysteinaemia
were independently related to the presence of CAD.
Conclusions: The prevalence of CAD was 32.3% in Chinese patients with PAF. Carotid stenosis
and CAD co-occurred in 7.8% of patients, and the prevalence of carotid stenosis correlated with
the severity of CAD. Screening of carotid stenosis is recommended, especially in patients with PAF
and multivessel CAD.

Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common
sustained cardiac arrhythmia and accounts
for a quarter of ischaemic strokes.1 AF is
associated with multiple symptoms, sub-
stantial morbidity and mortality and
decreased health-related quality-of-life
(HRQoL).2 The mortality rate for patients
with AF is almost twice that for individuals
with normal sinus rhythm: a fact that has
been attributed to increased cardiac death
due to underlying heart disease3,4 rather
than to thromboembolism.5
Arterial fibrillation is known to be asso-
ciated with coronary6­8 or carotid athero-
sclerosis.9­11 In patients with AF, the
presence of atherosclerotic vascular disease
is believed to amplify the risk of thrombo-
embolic stroke and vascular death.12­14
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is frequently
associated with carotid stenosis and carotid
atherosclerosis,15 but the co-prevalence of
CAD and carotid atherosclerosis in patients
with AF has not been studied.
The aims of the present study were to
investigate the co-prevalence of CAD and
carotid atherosclerosis, and to determine
predictors related to CAD in Chinese
patients with paroxysmal AF (PAF), pre-
senting without previously diagnosed or
excluded CAD.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study recruited consecutive patients
with drug-refractory PAF who underwent
multislice computed tomography (MSCT)
for coronary evaluation (due to an elevated
risk profile and/or chest pain) at Zhengzhou
People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan,
China, between June 2010 and October
2012. PAF was defined as self-terminating
episodes of AF lasting 7 days. Patients
with previously diagnosed or previously
excluded CAD, dilated or hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy or contraindications to
MSCT were excluded, in addition to
patients who were not in sinus rhythm
during MSCT examination.
All patients provided written informed
consent prior to enrolment and the study
was approved by the ethics committee of
Zhengzhou People's Hospital, Zhengzhou,
Henan, China.
Proatherogenic risk factors
Data regarding proatherogenic risk factors
were collected before MSCT. These included
sex, age, body mass index (BMI), hyperten-
sion (systolic blood pressure ! 140 mmHg or
diastolic blood pressure ! 90 mmHg or
receiving antihypertensive medication), dia-
betes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia (low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]; triglycer-
ide [TG], high-density lipoprotein choles-
terol [HDL-C]), smoking, family history of
CAD, estimated glomerular Eltration rate
(eGFR, calculated using the modification of
diet in renal disease formula),16 hyperhomo-
cysteinaemia (HHcY; total plasma homo-
cysteine [tHcy] !12.0 mmol/l), and previous
transient ischaemic attack or stroke.
Coronary angiography
Multislice computed tomography coronary
angiograms were obtained with 64-slice
scanners (LightSpeed VCT, GE Medical
Systems, Slough, UK) to determine the
presence of CAD. Both the original axial
dataset and curved multiplanar reconstruc-
tions were used. CAD was defined as lumen
diameter stenosis > 50% in ! 1 major cor-
onary artery. Patients were classified accord-
ing to the number of diseased vessels
present: one-vessel disease; two-vessel dis-
ease (disease in two vessels or left main trunk
disease without right coronary artery sten-
osis); three-vessel disease (disease in three
vessels or left main trunk disease with right
coronary artery stenosis).

Carotid atherosclerosis
Carotid artery atherosclerosis was evaluated
within one month before coronary MCST
using duplex ultrasonography with a 10-
MHz linear array transducer. Scanning of
the extracranial common carotid artery
(CCA), the carotid bulb (Bul), and the
internal carotid artery (ICA) in the neck
was performed bilaterally in three longitu-
dinal and transverse projections, and the site
of greatest intima­media thickness (IMT)
including plaque lesions was sought along
the arterial walls using B-mode and colour
Doppler ultrasound. Max-IMT was defined
as the largest carotid IMT in the observed
areas of the CCA, Bul and ICA.17 Carotid
stenosis was defined as atherosclerotic area
stenosis of > 50% or peak systolic velocity
of > 200 cm/s on the above carotid arteries.
All scans were conducted by experienced
laboratory technicians and physicians who
had no prior knowledge of the patient's
clinical characteristics.
Statistical analyses
Data were expressed as mean Æ SD for
continuous variables and n (%) for categor-
ical variables. Normally distributed data
were analysed using unpaired Student's t-
test, 2-test or Fisher's exact test, as appro-
priate. Mann­Whitney U-test was used
when data deviated from a Gaussian distri-
bution (evaluated via Kolmogorov­Smirnov
test). Multivariate stepwise logistic regres-
sion analysis was applied to evaluate the
relationship between demographic and clin-
ical data and the presence of CAD. Data
were analysed using SPSSÕ version 11.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. P-values< 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
The study included 192 patients with PAF
(137 male/55 female; mean age 69.2 Æ 8.6
years; age range 55­81 years). MSCT cor-
onary angiography was successfully per-
formed on all patients (mean heart rate
during MSCT 68 Æ 6 bpm). A total of 74
patients (38.5%) had no coronary artery
stenosis, 56 (29.2%) had nonobstructive
coronary artery stenosis and 62 (32.3%)
had CAD with at least one `significant'
coronary luminal narrowing. Demographic
and clinical characteristics of the study
population, stratified according to the
presence or absence of CAD, are given in
Table 1. Patients with CAD were signifi-
cantly more likely to have diabetes mellitus
(P ¼ 0.018) and HHcY (P < 0.001), and had
significantly higher tHcy (P < 0.001) and
max-IMT (P < 0.001) than patients without
CAD (Table 1). There were no other statis-
tically significant between-group differences
in any demographic or clinical
characteristic.
Of the 62 patients with CAD, 30 (48.4%)
had one-vessel disease, 20 (32.3%) had two-
vessel disease, and 12 (19.4%) had three-
vessel disease. The prevalence of carotid
stenosis in patients with CAD was 24.2%
(15/62). When stratified according to the
number of vessels affected, the prevalence of
carotid stenosis was 8.5% (11/130), 16.7%
(five of 30), 25.0% (five of 20), and 41.7%
(five of 12) of patients with zero-, one-, two-,
and three-vessel disease, respectively
(P < 0.001). In the study population as a
whole, 26 (13.5%) patients had carotid
stenosis and 15 (7.8%) had carotid stenosis
and CAD.
Multiple logistic regression analysis
(using age, male sex, smoking, diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, high BMI, high
LDL-C, high TG, low HDL-C, low eGFR,
HHCY and max-IMT as dependent vari-
ables) found that CAD was independently
associated with HHcY (odds ratio [OR]
2.12; 95% conEdence intervals [CI] 2.12,
5.24), diabetes mellitus (OR 2.08; 95%CI
1.36, 3.06) and max-IMT (OR 3.08; 95%CI
2.34, 5.14).

Discussion
The present study used anatomical assess-
ment to evaluate the prevalence of coexisting
CAD and carotid atherosclerosis among
Chinese patients with PAF, and found that
the prevalence of CAD was 32.3%. In
addition, 7.8% of patients in the present
study had coexisting carotid stenosis and
CAD, and the prevalence of carotid stenosis
correlated with the severity of CAD.
Moreover, diabetes mellitus, IMT and
HHcY were independently related to the
presence of CAD.
The prevalence of AF in the US popula-
tion is expected to increase from 2.3 million

in 2001 to 5.6 million in 2050.18 The preva-
lence of CAD in patients with AF is 18­41%
in Western countries,7,8,19 but only 6.4% in
Japan.20 This disparity may be linked to
differences in patients' backgrounds. The
prevalence of CAD in the present study was
32.3%, consistent with that of Western
countries, and may be related to the inclu-
sion of patients with suspected CAD ele-
vated risk profiles (including a Western-type
lifestyle). Of the 62 patients diagnosed with
CAD in the present study, 32 (51.6%) had
multivessel disease that may require percu-
taneous coronary intervention or coronary
artery bypass graft (CABG). Once diag-
nosed with AF, the presence of CAD has
been shown to be related to recurrent AF
episodes,21 presence of arrhythmia, heart
failure and angina,22 and increased risk of
death.23,24 Epidemiological data have indi-
cated that ischaemic heart disease is one of
the most common underlying causes of
death among patients with AF.25
Few studies have investigated the rela-
tionship between AF and carotid athero-
sclerosis.11,26,27 In a population-based
survey, subjects with carotid atheroscler-
osis were more likely to develop AF than
those without the condition.11 Increased
IMT and arterial stiffness have been found
to be associated with lone AF,10 and
patients with AF have a substantially
higher risk of stroke and death after
carotid endarterectomy.26 A prospective
study reported that carotid stenosis (40­
100%) and AF were signiEcant independ-
ent risk factors for new thromboembolic
stroke.27 In the present study, 13.5% of
patients with PAF had carotid stenosis,
and 24.2% of patients with PAF and CAD
had concomitant carotid stenosis. It is well
established that patients with `significant'
carotid stenosis have an increased risk of
stroke after CABG, and CAD is the most
common cause of morbidity and mortality
following carotid artery endovascular
intervention.28,29
Diabetes mellitus, IMT and HHcY were
independent predictors of CAD in the pre-
sent study. Diabetes mellitus is known to be
an independent predictor of CAD and is
associated with more advanced CAD.30
CAD is a major cause of death and impaired
HRQoL in patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus, and is generally detected at an
advanced, symptomatic stage.17 The early
detection of CAD is therefore critical in the
management of these patients. Carotid IMT
(a marker of early atherosclerosis and vas-
cular remodelling that can be assessed
quickly, noninvasively, and cheaply with
high-resolution ultrasonography) is corre-
lated with conventional coronary risk fac-
tors and is associated with cardiovascular
events and extent of CAD among patients
with known or suspected CAD or type 2
diabetes.10,11,17 Receiver operator character-
istic curve analyses revealed that the area
under the curve was higher for max-IMT
than for mean-IMT.31 In type 2 diabetic
patients without apparent cardiovascular
disease, the addition of max-IMT to con-
ventional risk factors substantially improves
the risk stratiEcation for CAD.17 Studies
have indicated that tHcy concentrations are
correlated with coronary atherosclerosis and
stroke, and can be used to predict mortality
in patients with CAD.32,33 In addition,
HHcY can predict the presence of CAD
and tHcy levels are signiEcantly associated
with the extent of coronary atherosclerosis
in patients with carotid stenosis.33
The present study has several limitations.
First, the study population included con-
secutive patients with PAF alone, and our
findings may not be applicable to those with
nonparoxysmal AF. Secondly, the nonran-
domized design of this single-centre investi-
gation may have influenced the comparative
analysis. Thirdly, no prognostic data were
available. A larger study with follow-up
data may provide more conclusive informa-
tion. While caution is therefore needed in the
interpretation of our data, we consider it
1298 Journal of International Medical Research 42(6)
improbable that these limitations have influ-
enced our main findings.
In conclusion, the prevalence of CAD
was 32.3% in Chinese patients with PAF
presenting without previously diagnosed or
excluded CAD. Carotid stenosis and CAD
co-occurred in 7.8% of patients, and the
prevalence of carotid stenosis correlated
with the severity of CAD. Diabetes mellitus,
IMT and HHcY were independently related
to the presence of CAD. Screening of
carotid stenosis is recommended, especially
in patients with PAF and multivessel CAD.
