Exercise and Affect
There is growing literature demonstrating that exercise is
associated with greater well-being, especially among women
(Brown, Gilson, Burton, & Brown, 2011; Lotan, Merrick, &
Carmeli, 2005; Penedo & Dahn, 2005). In particular, there is
promising evidence regarding the positive influence of exer-
cise and physical activity on several indicators of well-being
including affect (Berger & Motl, 2000; Biddle & Mutrie,
2008). Greater levels of positive affect have been identified
as a hallmark quality of well-being (Russell, 2003). More
specifically, repeated satisfying exposure to short-term posi-
tive affect states, such as those achievable with acute bouts
of exercise, can lead to increased well-being (Lyubomirsky,
King, & Diener, 2005; Rousseau & Vallerand, 2008).
Affect reflects the quality of a subjective feeling state and
Lazarus (2000) describes emotions (or affect) as motiva-
tional, thus, involving reactions to adaptational goals in a
person's life. Affect can be characterized by two dimensions,
namely, valence (positive/negative) and activation (high
activation [HA]/low activation [LA]; Ekkekakis &
Petruzzello, 2002). Whereas HA affect refers to an energetic
state and excitation, LA affect refers to a calm, relaxed or
depressed state. A dimensional definition facilitates the
detection and comparison of broader changes in affect in a
breadth of behavioral domains, such as exercise (Ekkekakis
& Petruzzello, 2002).
Meta-analytic evidence indicates that acute exercise has a
moderate, consistent effect on levels of positive affect (Reed
& Ones, 2006). Although underexamined as an influential
factor in regular exercise engagement, repeated, positive
affective experiences associated with individual (acute)
exercise sessions may sustain motivation over time and this
can facilitate long-term exercise participation (Focht, 2009;
Kwan & Bryan, 2010). Indeed, according to Self-
Determination Theory (SDT) motivation and affective indi-
cators of well-being are intricately connected (Deci & Ryan,
1985, 2002). It is relevant then that the link between exercise
and affect may be particularly evident in active, motivated
individuals who are experienced with exercise (Hoffman &
Hoffman, 2008; Markowitz & Arent, 2010). As some authors

The Moderating Influence of Situational
Motivation on the Relationship Between
Preferred Exercise and Positive Affect: An
Experimental Study With Active Women
Eva Guérin1 and Michelle S. Fortier1
Abstract
Despite convincing evidence supporting the association between exercise and positive affect, this complex relationship
requires further theoretical and person-centered explanation. The nature of one's motivation for exercise, as postulated by
Self-Determination Theory (SDT), may supply a missing and understudied link. The primary aim of this experimental study
was to examine the moderating influence of situational motivation from SDT on the relationship between an acute bout
of preferred exercise, namely running (vs. control), and changes in positive affect. Forty-one active women attended two
sessions to engage in (a) a 30-min moderate-intensity self-paced treadmill run and (b) a 30-min quiet activity (i.e., newspaper
reading). Participants with high introjection versus those with low introjection reported a greater increase in positive affect
from pre- to postrunning and a greater decrease in positive affect from pre- to postcontrol. A "relief from guilt" effect was
postulated to explain these results. Motivational variables accounted for 7% of variance in postrun positive affect. Consistent
with SDT, running because one values this behavior and its benefits (i.e., identified regulation) was significantly associated
with postrun positive affect.

have revealed, it can be informative to study an active popu-
lation because much can be learned regarding the determi-
nants of successful exercise engagement and associated
consequences, which could then be targeted among the insuf-
ficiently active (Duncan, Hall, Wilson, & Jenny, 2010).
Likewise, the relationship between exercise and well-
being, especially affect, seems to be quite pronounced in
women (Gill, Williams, Williams, Butki, & Young, 1997;
Kull, 2002). Studies with women consistently demonstrate
the positive influence of exercise on affective states immedi-
ately afterward (Cramp & Bray, 2010; Gauvin, Rejeski, &
Reboussin, 2000). Improvements in overall positive affect
among women have also been noted, as have improvements
in feelings of vitality (Kelsey et al., 2006; Wendel-Vos,
Schuit, Tijhuis, & Kromhout, 2004). Despite the emotional
benefits, women engage in lower levels of physical activity
than men, which may be related to psychological variables
that are uniquely associated with women's engagement in
exercise (Bassett, Wyatt, Thompson, Peters, & Hill, 2010;
Colley et al., 2011; Segar, Jayaratne, Hanlon, & Richardson,
2002). The SDT framework is one psychological perspective
that has been strongly advocated to explain women's engage-
ment in exercise, including affective experiences, and this
backing is consistent with broader calls in the literature for
more women-focused research looking at exercise
(Ainsworth, 2000; Landry & Solmon, 2002). On a more
global scale, women's mental health, which encompasses
their affective states, deserves attention in its own right as it
generally tends to be poorer than that of men (Denton, Prus,
& Walters, 2004).
Explaining the Exercise­Affect
Relationship
Although the evidence to date is convincing, the relationship
between exercise and well-being is far from simplistic, espe-
cially when it comes to predicting affect (Biddle & Ekkekakis,
2005). Indeed, variability across research findings is indica-
tive that not all individuals who participate in exercise
achieve greater well-being (O'Connor & Puetz, 2005). For
instance, Van Landuyt, Ekkekakis, Hall, and Petruzzello
(2000) found that only half of participants engaging in a
30- min moderate to high intensity cycling task felt progres-
sively better. The implication of these and other findings
such as Brown et al. (2004) is that merely engaging in exer-
cise, in terms of amount and/or intensity, may be insufficient
to accrue affective benefits. Indeed, there is a need for more
sophisticated knowledge of underlying processes with which
exercise may or may not benefit affective states (Berger &
Motl, 2000; Biddle & Ekkekakis, 2005; Ekkekakis, Parfitt,
& Petruzzello, 2011). Specifically, experts have called for
more research on the moderators associated with different
patterns of postexercise affect (Reed & Ones, 2006).
Moderating variables can inform us of the circumstances
under which a given association occurs.
Although exercise characteristics, such as type, intensity,
and duration can modify its association with affect, the evi-
dence remains inconsistent (Markowitz & Arent, 2010). In
addition, a sizable proportion of earlier research on exercise
stimulus factors has been atheoretical, prompting experts to
recommend greater use of theoretical models (Berger &
Motl, 2000; Reed & Buck, 2009). The use of theory allows
researchers to conjure up explanations of how and why cer-
tain phenomena occur (or do not). Despite some conceptual
progress, for example with "dual-mode theory" (Ekkekakis,
2003), physiological processes have been prioritized,
whereas other theory-based variables of a psychological
nature ought to be better accounted for (Berger & Motl,
2000; Ekkekakis et al. 2011; Reed & Ones, 2006). Among
the theoretical, person-centered work that has emerged (e.g.,
self-efficacy), to the authors' knowledge there is still a gap
with respect to moderating motivational variables, as ini-
tially highlighted by Berger and Motl (2000; Raedeke, Focht,
& Scales, 2009). Surely there is a need for more theory-based
enquiries of motivation in this area given the central role of
motivational variables in our understanding of exercise
behavior and of indicators of well-being, such as positive
affect (Biddle & Mutrie, 2008; Sebire, Standage, &
Vansteenkiste, 2009). Examining motivation as one theory-
based link may help explain conflicting evidence in this area.
Self-Determined Motivation
Specifically, the quality of motivation, namely, one's self-
determination as purported by SDT, may supply a missing
link in understanding well-being (in this case, affect)-related
outcomes of exercise (Thøgersen-Ntoumani & Fox, 2007).
Moderation frameworks, using self-determined motivation
have proven useful in explaining behavior­well-being rela-
tionships (Lemyre, Roberts, & Stray-Gundersen, 2007).
According to the founders of SDT, the guiding theoretical
framework for this study, motivation can be distinguished
along a continuum from controlled (extrinsic) motivation,
resulting from demands and/or pressure, to more autono-
mous or self-determined motivation, arising from elements
of volition, choice, and interest (Deci & Ryan, 1985). The
continuum is delineated as having six behavioral regulations
that are increasingly more self-determined (Deci & Ryan,
2002). The influence of motivation is also thought to be hier-
archically organized, whereby the regulations operate at
three levels of generality: situational, contextual, and global
(Vallerand, 2007). Whereas situational motivation refers to a
state of motivation experienced at a specific point in time,
contextual motivation is a more stable motivational orienta-
tion for the activity defined more broadly. Global motivation
implies a person's general orientation to interact with their
environment at large (Vallerand, 2007). Within this hierar-
chy, the level of a given outcome (e.g., postexercise affect)
should correspond to the motivation level that produced it
(e.g., pre-exercise, situational).
Guérin and Fortier 3
Amotivation lies at one end of the continuum and repre-
sents lacking the intention to act and adjacent to it, external
regulation is defined as being motivated according to exter-
nal demands (e.g., to avoid punishment for not running; Deci
& Ryan, 2002). Next, introjection involves a slight internal-
ization, a process whereby regulation of a behavior is taken
in and integrated with one's sense of who they are. Still, there
is little acceptance of it as one's own because, for example, a
woman may be following a running program due to senti-
ments of guilt or shame (e.g., physique-related; Deci & Ryan,
2002). Often, one feels pressure to engage in the activity to
gain a sense of self-worth. Next on the spectrum is identified
regulation; this is the first of the more self-determined moti-
vation types as it arises when an individual values the behav-
ior and assigns it personal importance (e.g., running for one's
health). Ensuing is integrated regulation, which involves
engaging in an activity because it is well assimilated into
one's identity and core values (e.g., "I am a runner").
Measurement of the latter regulation has been much less
common given that empirical distinctions between identified
and integrated regulation have been slower to emerge. Last,
at the other extremity of the continuum lies intrinsic motiva-
tion, as characterized by enjoyment and by inherent satisfac-
tion in an activity, whereby an individual engages in the
activity for its own sake (Deci & Ryan, 2002).
In SDT, it is posited that controlling forms of motivation
(i.e., external, introjected) generally lead to less adaptive
consequences than more autonomous motivation (i.e., intrin-
sic, identified). Studies have consistently shown that indi-
viduals who are more self-determined for exercise tend to
not only engage in more physical activity (Sebire, Standage,
& Vansteenkiste, 2011) but also report greater emotional
benefits, such as elevated general positive affect (Puente &
Anshel, 2010). Self-determined motivation (intrinsic moti-
vation and identified regulation in particular) can also pre-
dict better self-evaluation patterns, which have been linked
to positive affect and well-being (Brunet & Sabiston, 2009;
Thøgersen-Ntoumani & Ntoumanis, 2006). Among regular
exercisers, intrinsic exercise motives have been tied to lower
stress levels and better scores on global indicators of well-
being (Maltby & Day, 2001).
Conversely and still in the exercise context, external
regulation among women has been associated with unstable
self-esteem and greater negative affect (Gagné, Ryan, &
Bargmann, 2003). Moreover, introjected regulation for
exercise has been linked to lower vitality and poorer life sat-
isfaction (Edmunds, Ntoumanis, & Duda, 2007; Thøgersen-
Ntoumani & Fox, 2007). However, results are somewhat
equivocal with introjection because this type of motivation
has also been correlated with behavioral persistence (Sabiston
et al., 2010; Stephan, Boiché, & Le Scanff, 2010). There is
evidence that, for women, higher amounts of introjection can
have a positive influence on intentions and exercise behavior
itself (Markland, 2009; Thøgersen-Ntoumani & Ntoumanis,
2006). This controlling regulation has also been associated
with the intensity with which women exert themselves dur-
ing exercise, which can impact their affect postexercise
(Duncan et al., 2010; Guérin & Fortier, 2012). Indeed,
women have been found to endorse greater levels of introjec-
tion than men (Wilson, Rodgers, Fraser, & Murray, 2004). In
sum, the influence of introjection appears to be ambiguous.
Although introjection can positively predict behavioral
engagement (i.e., exercise), it may simultaneously compro-
mise markers of well-being (i.e., affect), as purported by
SDT (Teixeira, Carraca, Silva, & Ryan, 2012).
There are only a few studies that have examined the influ-
ence of self-determination on positive affect in the acute
phase of exercise. Among them, Lutz, Lochbaum, and
Turnbow (2003) found that higher self-determined contex-
tual motivation toward exercise predicted greater positive
affect after an exercise class. However, their research design
did not allow for testing the specific moderating effect of
self-determined motivation, including the motivational regu-
lations as distinct predictors/moderators, and the authors
focused on contextual motivation. Moreover, Lutz et al. used
the convenience of an exercise class rather than an experi-
mental design. Despite the advantage of naturalistic research
for improved ecological validity, it offers less containment of
confounding influences (e.g., social variables, distractions,
etc.).
Also, there is evidence to support the suggestion that
affective states produced or modified in controlled environ-
ments are not that different from those in nonlaboratory set-
tings (Blanchard, Rodgers, & Gauvin, 2004). Experimental
studies of exercise enable good control of extraneous influ-
ences, allowing for explorations of potential mechanisms
as well as moderating processes/conditions. Therefore, the
focus of the present investigation was on the moderating
effect of motivation on the acute exercise-positive affect
link in the context of an in-laboratory, running experiment.
It would appear that this is the first study to pursue this. In
keeping with expert advice that laboratory researchers
should adequately match an exerciser's usual exercise
modality, we targeted self-reported runners (Kerr & Kuk,
2001). This was also prudent given evidence that exercise
preference and familiarity can influence exercise-related
mood changes (Lane, Jackson, & Terry, 2005). Likewise, a
self-paced running task was deemed favorable as this was
in line with SDT principles of optimizing choice as well as
evidence, showing greater positive affective responses
from self-paced exercise (Vazou-Ekkekakis & Ekkekakis,
2009).
Aims and Hypotheses
The purpose of this within-participant experiment was to
examine the moderating influence of situational motivation
(for running) on the relationship between an acute bout of
preferred exercise (i.e., running vs. control) and pre-post
changes in positive affect. This study was part of a larger
4 SAGE Open
project. The results of a preliminary paper focusing solely on
the running activity showed that introjected regulation inter-
acted with the perceived intensity of the run to predict posi-
tive affect such that women with lower introjection saw
improvements in positive affect as their ratings of perceived
exertion (RPE) for the run increased (Guérin & Fortier,
2012). By comparing a running activity with a control task,
the present enquiry expands on the previous report by testing
the full moderating effect of motivational regulations indi-
vidually. Several premises were tested.
First, a preliminary hypothesis was that participants
would show a greater pre-to-post increase in positive affect
when engaging in a running task compared with a control
task (Blanchard et al., 2004; Reed & Ones, 2006). Second,
based on SDT and the little research to date, it was expected
that women with higher levels of intrinsic motivation and
identified regulation would show strong increases in positive
affect postrunning and not postcontrol (i.e., moderation
effect; Edmunds et al., 2007; Lutz et al., 2003). In contrast,
given prominent feelings of pressure/onus to run that seem
incongruent with pleasant states, women with higher levels
of external and introjected regulations would show a weak or
no change in positive affect postrunning, similar to that
achieved postcontrol (Deci & Ryan 2002; Teixeira et al.,
2012).
Given these speculations, a third and exploratory line of
enquiry targeted the relative effects of motivational regula-
tions on positive affect following the running task specifi-
cally. Based on SDT and previous findings (Lutz et al., 2003;
Edmunds et al., 2007), it was expected that intrinsic and
identified regulations would exert positive influences on
postrun positive affect after controlling for prerun (baseline)
levels of affect. These regulations would explain a greater
amount of variance in postrun positive affect than introjected
or external regulations, as these latter associations with post-
run affect were expected to be weak or even slightly
negative.
Method
Participants
Women between the ages of 25 and 55 years were recruited
from local universities, chiropractic clinics, and sport/chil-
dren stores via posters and word of mouth as well as through
running/athletics websites. Eligible participants reported no
underlying medical condition, were not currently pregnant,
and satisfied a health screening test for exercise. All partici-
pants were active; that is, they reported a minimum of 20 min
of moderate to vigorous exercise at least three times per
week for at least 6 months. It was also required that partici-
pants perceive running as their preferred or most frequent
exercise modality. These criteria were confirmed via self-
report during each participant's initial contact to participate
in this study.1 The final sample size was 41, and this was
deemed satisfactory to detect a medium-sized effect using
repeated measures ANOVAs (GPower 3.1.2) and as estab-
lished from previous studies (Reed & Ones, 2006). Although
small for multiple regressions, these adjunct analyses served
an exploratory purpose and no a priori power analysis was
conducted. That said, similar sample sizes have been used in
other repeated measures investigations in this area as well as
other studies applying hierarchical regression with a similar
number of variables (e.g., Berlin, Kop, & Deuster, 2006).
Measures
Demographic/background measures.
A demographic form
consisted of questions that were both general (e.g., occupa-
tion, height, weight) and running specific (e.g., I have been
running at my current intensity/frequency for: [blank]
months). Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight
(in pounds) multiplied by 703 then divided by height (in
inches) squared. The Godin Leisure Time Exercise Ques-
tionnaire (LTEQ; Godin & Shephard, 1985) was used to
describe participants' current exercise levels . Participants
evaluated the number of days in a typical week they had
engaged in light, moderate, and strenuous exercise. The fre-
quency values were multiplied by their corresponding inten-
sity value, namely 3, 5, and 9, and then summed to provide a
total weekly activity score. All 41 women met a cut-off score
of 24 to be included in the analyses, which is consistent with
recommendations for health benefits and is equivalent to just
over two vigorous and one moderate session per week
(Godin, 2011).
Affect. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS;
Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) was administered to mea-
sure pre- and post-task affect. The PANAS is a popular
instrument to measure affect in SDT research and in exercise
studies (Reed & Ones, 2006). The PANAS is an appropriate
measure across exercise and nonexercise situations (i.e., lab-
oratory studies), although it is a measure of HA affect only
(Ekkekakis & Petruzzello, 2001). Therefore, a welcome con-
tribution in the exercise context was to integrate LA items
into the PANAS, as it had been done in other domains (e.g.,
Abercrombie, Kalin, & Davidson, 2005). Indeed, some
researchers have substantiated that exercise can induce posi-
tive feelings of calmness and relaxation, typical of LA affect,
and they argue that these affective properties should not be
ignored (Blanchard et al., 2004; Gauvin & Rejeski, 2001). In
this study, 11 items (5 positive) established by Feldman-
Barrett and Russell (1998) to assess LA affect were used to
supplement the original PANAS, which is comprised of 20
adjective words (10 positive and 10 negative [also see Aber-
crombie et al.]).2
For each of the 31 adjectives, responses to the stem
Indicate to what extent you feel this way right now, that is, at
the present moment were rated from (1) not at all to (5)
extremely. Examples of adjectives include "excited"
Guérin and Fortier 5
(positive, HA) and "serene" (positive, LA). Given the focus
on positive affect in this study, only these items were
summed, separately for HA and LA, and analyzed.3 Internal
consistency values for all times points in the present study
were robust and can be found in Table 1.
Situational motivation.
The Situational Motivation Scale
(SIMS; Guay, Vallerand, & Blanchard, 2000) was used to
measure situational motivation for running. The SIMS con-
sists of 16 items with four subscales that evaluate the differ-
ent behavioral regulations (Standage, Treasure, Duda, &
Prusak, 2003). Integrated and introjected regulations were
excluded from the original SIMS to condense the scale (Guay
et al., 2000). However, given the relevance of introjection in
this study, an enhanced version of the SIMS was used, which
contained four additional introjection items developed by
Gillet, Vallerand, Lafrenière, and Bureau (2013).4 Responses
to the stem why are you currently [about to run] are anchored
on a 7-point Likert-type scale from (1) corresponds not at all
to (7) corresponds exactly. A sample item is "because I think
this activity is pleasant" (intrinsic motivation).
Average scores were calculated for intrinsic motivation,
identified regulation, and introjected regulation. The psycho-
metric properties of the SIMS are documented elsewhere,
including significant factor loadings for the modified version
with introjection (Gillet et al., 2013; Standage et al. 2003).
The Cronbach's alpha values of the given subscales in the
present study are displayed in Table 1. As expected from a
sample of active participants, scores on external regulation
and amotivation were low and variance levels were negligi-
ble, which contributed to low internal consistency values. No
further analyses were conducted on these regulations; no
hypotheses had been forwarded for amotivation.
Intensity measure. In this study, the RPE scale (Borg, 1982)
was used solely for descriptive purposes regarding the aver-
age perceived intensity of the running task and not for pur-
poses of analysis. Readers can consult Guérin & Fortier
(2012) for a more detailed examination of the intensity vari-
able. The RPE consists of self-reported numerical values
from 6 to 20 that are anchored with descriptors at every odd
integer (i.e., 7 = very, very light; 13 = somewhat hard; 19 =
very, very hard). The RPE has been popularized in studies of
exercise and affect, and its validity and reliability are well
established (W. Russell & Newton, 2008).
Design and Procedures
This experimental study was approved by the University of
Ottawa Ethics Review Board. It followed a 2 (running, con-
trol) × 2 (pre, post) repeated-measures design. A traditional
pre-post design was used based on the results of an important
meta-analytic review (Reed & Ones, 2006) and given that
the focus was, similar to others, on immediate changes in
affect following exercise (Hallgren, Moss, & Gastin, 2010;
Miller, Bartholomew, & Springer, 2005). Each participant
attended two individual sessions (one week apart) at a cam-
pus laboratory. Blinding participants to the task they would
receive at each session was expected to minimize carryover
and expectation effects. Upon arrival, the women provided
written consent after being informed of (a) the purpose to
examine psychological factors during physical and/or non-
physical activities (b) the protocol, namely that at the start of
each session they would be randomly assigned to one of two
tasks (i.e., running, quiet attention-control). In reality, a
within-person comparison of the two tasks was sought and
counterbalancing was used to assign half of the women to the

running task at their first session (n = 21) and the other half
at their second session.
At the start of Session 1, each woman completed the
intake assessment (i.e., background and LTEQ) followed by
the SIMS and the PANAS promptly before being assigned
one of the tasks. Session 2 followed a similar format with the
omission of the intake assessment. Session 2 concluded with
a short debrief (5 min) to inform participants of the compo-
nents of this study.
Running task. Each participant was taken to a private exer-
cise room equipped with a treadmill, a desk, and a chair. The
treadmill control panel was physically detached from the
running belt. This allowed the researcher to easily monitor
and adjust settings according to the participant's requests to
mimic a self-paced, moderate-to-high intensity run. The par-
ticipants completed a 2 to 3 min warm-up at an average
speed of 5.17 km/hr. Next, the researcher sped up the belt to
the participant's desired pace. The researcher remained in
proximity for any requests to alter the speed, the details and
timing of which were duly noted. An average running pace
was calculated by weighting any change in pace by the ratio
of elapsed time at that pace. Conversation and eye contact
between participant and researcher was kept to a minimum.
Participants ran for 30 min as this can be considered to be a
standard duration for examining acute exercise and affective
states (e.g., Van Landuyt et al., 2000). Then, the belt was
slowed to the initial walking speed for a 2-min cool down.
The participant stepped off the treadmill and promptly pro-
vided their running RPE and responded to PANAS.
Control task. Each participant was taken individually to a pri-
vate and quiet room equipped with a chair and a desk on
which was laid out the daily newspaper and a small selection
of general-topic magazines (e.g., home renovations, politics,
and community). The researchers were very discerning in
their selection of neutral reading material; suggestions of
health and body image were minimized to avoid inflation/
deflation influences on affect. This type of quiet, seated con-
trol task is common in exercise studies (e.g., Vocks, Hechler,
Rohrig, & Legenbauer, 2009). The participant was instructed
to occupy her attention with the provided material until the
designated time had elapsed. The researcher busied herself in
the adjacent workspace to mimic the procedures/presence of
the running task. After roughly 35 to 37 min (running task
total time with warm up/cool down), the participant promptly
responded to the PANAS.
Analyses
All data were entered into SPSS Version 18.0. Data screen-
ing procedures were conducted according to guidelines set
out by Tabachnick and Fidell (2007); this included assess-
ments of data entry errors, missing data, outliers, normality
and testing of basic assumptions of analyses of variance and
regression analyses. Table 1 provides basic descriptive statis-
tics and reliability analyses that were calculated for affect
and motivation variables.
Using repeated-measures t tests and bivariate correla-
tions, scores for the three motivational variables were exam-
ined across sessions to justify using average scores of
situational motivation to simplify their inclusion as covari-
ates. To test the preliminary hypotheses, a series of repeated
measures ANOVAs were conducted. Specifically, the data
for HAand LAaffect were subjected to 2 (task: running, con-
trol) × 2 (time: pre, post) ANOVAs, respectively. A series of
post hoc t tests with Bonferroni adjustment ensued to dissect
the findings. Next, to test the moderating influences of situ-
ational motivational regulations as continuous variables, the
ANOVAs were repeated by specifying intrinsic motivation
as well as identified and introjected regulations indepen-
dently as a covariate in each model (i.e., ANCOVA). The
alpha level was adjusted for multiple tests (p < .02). In graph-
ing significant interaction(s), high and low values of the
moderators (motivation covariates) were specified as one
standard deviation above and below the mean (Aiken &
West, 1991).
Last, to test exploratory hypotheses pertaining to the run-
ning task, separate hierarchical multiple regressions were
conducted for postrun HA affect and postrun LA affect as
dependent variables. Namely, for each of the two regression
models, scores on the three motivational regulations were
added as predictors in Step 2 after controlling for prerun
affect in Step 1.
Results
Preliminary Analyses
Mean substitution estimation was used for missing data
points (2.4%) as this amount was less than 5% (Tabachnick
& Fidell, 2007). Using standardized scores, no univariate
outliers were identified for any of the affect or motivation
variables. Normality was confirmed by examining the distri-
butions of the variables (i.e., histograms) and their skewness
and kurtosis values. There were no issues with linearity,
homoscedasticity or collinearity. Last, scores for motivation
toward running remained stable from one session to the next
(ps > .05) and were highly correlated (ps < .01); thus, aver-
age scores across session for the regulations were used as
covariates in the ANOVAs.
Sample and Running Task Characteristics
Seventy-six women volunteered for this study. Thirty-four
were deemed ineligible either on the basis of the aforemen-
tioned criteria or due to scheduling/contacting issues. One
woman was excluded as she failed to attend both sessions.
All demographic information as well as leisure time running
behavior and in-laboratory running information of the final
Guérin and Fortier 7
sample (N = 41) can be found in Table 2. Overall, the women
in this study were middle-aged on average, were well-
educated, and were primarily Caucasian. Healthy BMI and
high activity levels were reported on the whole.
Time and Task Effects
To test the preliminary hypothesis, results of the repeated
measuresANOVAfor HArevealed a significant difference in
positive affect between tasks (F[1,40] = 46.47, p < .001, 2 =
.54) and across time, F(1,40) = 5.83, p < .05, 2 = .13, as well
as a significant interaction between time and task, F(1,40) =
40.52, p < .001, 2 = .50. Statistical values and effect sizes for
post hoc analyses of simple effects can be found in Table 1. As
expected, there was a significant increase in HA positive
affect from pre- to postrunning task and a significant decrease
from pre- to postcontrol task. For LA positive affect, there
was a significant main effect of time, F(1,40) = 20.65, p <
.001, 2 = .34, but not of task, F(1,40) = 2.34, p < .13, 2 =
.06. The interaction between task and time was significant,
F(1,40) = 4.48, p < .05, 2 = .10. Follow-up pairwise testing
of this interaction revealed that, although there was a mar-
ginal increase in LA positive affect after the running task
(p = .54), this increase was actually more pronounced for the
control task (see Table 1). Last, follow-up analyses revealed
that for HA positive affect, levels postrun were significantly
higher than levels postcontrol task. The reverse was found
for LA positive affect, whereby levels postcontrol were sig-
nificantly higher than levels postrun.
Moderating Effects
Repeated measures ANCOVAs were well suited to examine
the moderating influence of motivational variables on time by
task relationships. For HA positive affect, there was a signifi-
cant three-way interaction between task, time, and introjection
as a continuous covariate, F(1, 39) = 4.71, p < .05, 2 = .11.
Figure 1 presents a helpful visual display of this complex asso-
ciation. As shown, for women with higher levels of
introjection (i.e., greater than 1 SD above the mean) both the
increase in HA affect from pre- to postrun and, interestingly,
the decrease in HA from pre- to postcontrol were more pro-
nounced than for those with lower levels of introjection. The
three-way interaction between the identified regulation covari-
ate, task, and time was not significant, F(1,39) = .92, p = .34,
2 = .02, nor was the interaction significant for intrinsic moti-
vation, F(1,39) = .23, p = .34, 2 = .01. For LA affect, there

were no significant interactions between motivational regula-
tions, task, and time.
Motivation Effects for Running
Hierarchical regressions were conducted separately for HA
and LA positive affect to explore the influence of motivation
during the running task specifically. All results can be found
in Table 3. Starting with HA and after controlling for levels
of prerun affect, intrinsic, identified and introjected regula-
tion variables accounted for approximately 7% of the total
79% of variance explained in the model. Identified regula-
tion was a significant and positive predictor of the increase in
HA affect from pre- to postrunning, whereas introjection was
also a positive and marginally significant predictor (p = .05).
However, the beta for intrinsic motivation fell below signifi-
cance levels, remaining so even when the other regulations
were removed from the model (not shown). Motivation vari-
ables did not predict a significant amount of variance in post-
run LA positive affect after controlling for prerun affect.
Discussion
Strengths
The objective of this experimental study was to examine the
effect of situational motivation (for running) on the relation-
ship between running (exercise) and immediate changes in
positive affect. Examining person-centered and malleable
SDT-based variables as modifying agents was unique to this
study and provides innovative theory-driven insight regard-
ing motivational circumstances that may inform underlying
processes (Biddle & Ekkekakis, 2005). Key methodological
features of this study lend strength to our findings, such as
the use of a preferred exercise modality and a laboratory set-
ting in which extraneous factors were minimized. This study
adds support for the acute benefits of exercise on a key indi-
cator of well-being given that increases in positive affective
states surfaced in our sample (Biddle & Mutrie, 2008). As
expected, participants experienced an increase in HA and LA
positive affect after 30 min of running. Moreover, the
increase in HA affect was not seen after the control task.
These findings add to the scarcity of experimental research
in this area, particularly with women (Kull, 2002). This study
supports ongoing efforts to understand the emotional bene-
fits of regular exercise among women and it supplements
literature attesting to the immediate affective benefits of run-
ning as a form of exercise for women (Butryn & Furts, 2003;
Kelsey et al., 2006). From an applied standpoint, for instance
in the context of lifestyle interventions targeting women, the
findings hint that it may be worthwhile to emphasize the
direct benefits of preferred exercise on indicators of well-
being, such as positive affect.
Self-Determined Motivation: Considerations
The distinctive findings pertaining to motivation in this
study, which accounted for a perceptible 7% of the 79% of
variance in positive affect after controlling for prerun affect,
help conjure up a number of interesting deliberations based
on the principles of SDT, our guiding theoretical framework.
We found that introjected regulation was a significant mod-
erator of the relationship between running and affect, with
levels of introjection being positively related to levels of
postrun HA affect. Meanwhile, the moderating effects of
self-determined regulations were not significant. Yet, identi-
fied regulation played a unique, positive role in the increase
in positive affect with running, lending partial support to
SDT (Deci & Ryan, 2002). This finding is consistent with
Thøgersen-Ntoumani and Fox (2007), who found that identi-
fied regulation predicted physical well-being, although they
did not examine exercise-related affective changes.
Still, our nonsignificant results for intrinsic motivation
and the small (yet significant) effect for identified regulation
do not fully align with SDT and past studies reporting sig-
nificant and stronger associations between self-determina-
tion and exercise-induced changes in affect and well-being
(Lutz et al., 2003; Standage et al., 2003;Thøgersen-Ntoumani
& Ntoumanis, 2006). The finding that identified regulation
predicted an increase in positive affect postrunning is

consistent with an SDT assertion that when individuals
engage in exercise because they value the behavior and its
benefits, they are more likely to feel better about themselves
and overall (Ryan & Deci, 2000; Thøgersen-Ntoumani &
Fox, 2007). Our findings for intrinsic motivation, however,
tend to resonate with those of Gagné et al. (2003), who saw
that incoming self-determined motivation among gymnasts
did not significantly predict changes in indicators of well-
being from pre- to postpractice. Although the results for
intrinsic motivation appear counterintuitive given the strong
enjoyment factor that defines this regulation, some authors
have shown that identified motivation may be equally influ-
ential in predicting persistence in health behaviors, such as
exercise, given that strenuous physical activities may not be
perceived as inherently pleasurable (Wilson et al., 2004).
Given that the women who participated in this study were
persistent, high-intensity exercisers, this regulation may hold
particular weight. It should be reiterated however that our
regression analyses were underpowered and that the means
for the self-determined regulations were high and the vari-
ances low. These descriptive statistics are not surprising
given an active sample but could have led to restricted ranges
and ceiling effects that weakened the explanatory power of
these variables, an issue that was compounded by the large
proportion of variance explained by prerun affect.
The results of this study also showed that scoring high on
introjection was associated with experiencing higher levels
of HA positive affect after running. From a conceptual stand-
point, it could be that the source of introjection in the labora-
tory may be different from that of everyday running.
Specifically, the level of introjection and its relationship with
affect could be related to feelings of obligation to the study
and a desire to please the researcher (experimental introject),
rather than, or in addition to, a desire to not let oneself down,
which would arise with regular day-to-day running (personal
introject). Consequently, participants may feel more positive
affect after the run as there is a release from the stress they
have imposed on themselves, including pressures as research
participants (i.e., "I should run because I agreed to do this
study and/or I haven't run today and I need to"). Altogether,
these premises are consistent with the idea that individuals
with greater introjection likely have more contingencies
attached to the pleasure they derive from exercise (Guérin &
Fortier, 2012). Conversely, self-determined regulations may
be more stable and less vulnerable to situational fluctuations
in sources of motivation (e.g., "I always value running"),
thus exerting a lesser moderating influence on pre-post dis-
crepancies in affect in the laboratory, as reflected by our
findings.
Undoubtedly, the findings for introjection in our study are
consistent with its characteristic ties to individuals' self-
worth (Deci & Ryan, 2002). According to Sabiston et al.
(2010), "guilt may motivate reparative action" and thus, for
some women, the running session may have improved affect
by relieving negative feelings from not having yet exercised
(p. 419). Similarly, positive affect can ensue following an
activity for which one has an ego-involved goal orientation
(a form of introjection), perhaps due to a relief from stress
that arises from not having completed the activity/goal (Nix,
Ryan, Manly, & Deci, 1999). Still, experts contend that such
peaks in positive affect may be short-lived and probably not
mentally restorative or conducive to better mental health
(Nix et al., 1999). Thus, introjected runners may not benefit
fully from the revitalization qualities of exercise. It may be
worthwhile to assess feelings of vitality in similar studies in
the future and to do so more longitudinally.
Given the above remarks, it may be prudent to hold reser-
vations regarding possible moderating effects of introjection
on changes in affect over the long term, although this was not
tested in the present study. Although repeated positive affec-
tive experiences with exercise can sustain this type of behav-
ior (Kwan & Bryan, 2010), this behavioral persistence can
also escalate into rigid persistence, such as an exercise
dependence. Hence, short-term postexercise peaks in posi-
tive affect among exercisers displaying high introjection
may not translate into greater well-being over time, despite
engaging in a physically active lifestyle. Stephan et al. (2010)
saw high levels of self-determination as well as introjection
in women who persisted with exercise, hinting that perhaps
introjection must be coupled with more autonomous motiva-
tional forces. However, Stephan and colleagues did not
assess emotional outcomes. Altogether, more attention is
needed on the long-term effects of introjection on affective
states, and this echoes views by Thøgersen-Ntoumani and
Ntoumanis (2006).
Pulling from the experimental design, findings for the
control task also provided worthwhile insights. Indeed, com-
pared with women low in introjection, those with higher lev-
els experienced a greater decrease in positive affect after
completing the nonexercise quiet control task. This affect
drop adds evidence to our supposition that, for these women,
being unable to run or exercise may sustain feelings of guilt
and thwart positive affective states. These findings are con-
sistent with literature on exercise dependency cited above as
well as with, we speculate, research on the influence of pas-
sion (Vallerand et al., 2003). Namely, when obsessively pas-
sionate individuals, as characterized by feeling compelled to
engage in a valued activity, are deprived of the activity, they
experience anxiety and worsening of affect (Vallerand et al.,
2003). That some active women might experience more
negative emotional states from a short relaxing activity is a
cause for concern and hints at the overall complexity of the
exercise-affect link.
Exercise and Affect: Beyond Situational
Motivation
As can be appreciated from these deliberations, it is likely
that other motivation-related variables within SDT or that
align well with SDT, such as passion, may also underlie the
10 SAGE Open
exercise-positive affect relationship. SDT provided a strong
theoretical foundation for this study; within its hierarchical
structure, we spotlight the unique, yet perhaps conflicting,
effect of situational motivation. While this level of focus
contributes to the literature on exercise and affect, future
research may wish to also include how runners' contextual
motivation contributes to the exercise-affect relationship
(e.g., motivational shift). Indeed, there may be a complex
interrelationship between the regulations at various levels,
other SDT constructs like the psychological needs, and exer-
cise outcomes, such as affect (McDonough & Crocker, 2007;
Sebire et al., 2009). This plausible complexity is worthy of
further investigation.
Certain elements of the protocol in the current study were
consistent with the guiding principles of SDT, thereby reduc-
ing confounding effects. Namely, only females who were
familiar with running and who, presumably, felt competent
with running, were selected to participate. In addition, the
self-paced running task promoted participants' autonomy
and was expected to mimic a day-to-day run. However, the
control task consisted of sitting in a quiet room reading the
newspaper, which could have been a welcomed activity for
participants with busy families and hectic schedules. The
possible influence of reading material content on affect
should also be acknowledged. Indeed, participants experi-
enced a greater increase in LA positive affect (e.g., relaxed)
with the control task compared with the running task. The
lack of significant findings for LA for the running task reso-
nates with a study by Bartholomew, Moore, Todd, Todd, and
Elrod (2001) that failed to witness an exercise-related
increase in the analogous state of tranquility. Moreover, these
task-based differences for LA affect may not be entirely sur-
prising given evidence that interoceptive cues arising from
the physiological stimuli of an exercise task can increase lev-
els of activation and alter affective valence (Bryan,
Hutchison, Seals, & Allen, 2007; Ekkekakis 2003).
Limitations and Summary
Lastly, the findings of this study should be interpreted within
the context of certain limitations. Given the small sample size,
regression results must be taken as exploratory and indicative
of trends between variables that will need to be examined in
larger samples. Moreover, additional caution is required in
interpreting the results for identified regulation given that this
subscale revealed a low alpha in our sample, which is similar
to that of other studies (e.g., Ntoumanis & Blaymires, 2003).
In fact, the internal consistency values of the SIMS in this
study warrant further testing of its psychometric properties in
the exercise context. It may be a more psychometrically sound
indicator of situational regulations in other domains and/or
under manipulations of a participants' autonomy (Guay et al.,
2000; Muraven, Rosman, & Gagné, 2007).
In addition, despite the popularity of the pre-post design,
several researchers have taken to assessing affect repetitively
during exercise as this may be more sensitive to exercise
intensity and resistant to dissipation effects (Backhouse,
Ekkekakis, Biddle, Foskett, & Williams, 2007; Ekkekakis et
al., 2011). Moreover, the generalizability of the current find-
ings to natural day-to-day contexts may be limited as the
laboratory could have been experienced as cold and/or bor-
ing (e.g., no music, other runners, scenery), thus influencing
responses. Although we attempted to minimize threats to
internal validity as well as expectancy effects (e.g., via coun-
terbalancing, "blinding" participants), it would be helpful in
future studies to also consider a more extensive variety of
compromising factors inherent in experimental designs, as
outlined elsewhere in the literature (Reed & Ones, 2006;
Thomas & Neilson 2001). Finally, more studies are also
needed that draw on daily experience sampling whereby
women's motivational patterns and affective changes, as
well as any reciprocal influences, can be modeled over time
in natural exercise environments (Guérin, Fortier, & Sweet,
2013; Kwan, Hooper, Magnan, & Bryan, 2011).
In sum, and as guided by SDT, situational motivation can
influence changes in positive affect acquired during an acute
exercise session, although more work is needed on the long-
term effects of a regulation guided by guilt and obligation.
Moreover, given the large amount of variance it explained, it
would be worthwhile to also consider ways of maximizing
pre-exercise affect, in conjunction with motivation, to opti-
mize postexercise benefits.

Notes
1. As this study was part of a larger project examining psycho-
logical variables, physical activity and well-being in active
women with multiple life roles, additional criteria that are not
elaborated on in this paper were also imposed at the time of
recruitment. That is, women also had to be mothers with at
least one child under the age of 18 years living at home, and
had to be employed a minimum of 30-hr/week (full time).
2. Items added to the PANAS to assess LA affect (Feldman-
Barrett & Russell, 1998): relaxed, at rest, serene, calm, at ease
(+); tired, sluggish, droopy, dull, bored, drowsy (-).
3. Although the full PANAS was administered, no analyses could
be conducted on negative affect because this subscale (with
and without LA items) demonstrated low internal consistency
(Cronbach's alpha) in the present study. Other authors have also
Guérin and Fortier 11
reported measurement issues with negative affect in the exercise
context and this issue may play a role in the proper interpreta-
tion of results (Kwan & Bryan, 2010; Lutz et al., 2008).
4. Items measuring introjection in the enhanced Situational
Motivation Scale (SIMS; Gillet et al., 2013): (1) Because I
would feel bad not doing it, (2) Because I would feel guilty not
to do it, (3) Because I want to avoid feeling guilty, (4) Because
I would regret not doing it.
