Abstract
Objective: The optimal plate for fixation of tarsometatarsal joint injuries is controversial. The
objective of this study was to compare the biomechanical characteristics between a locking plate
and 1/4 tubular plate for first tarsometatarsal joint fracture-dislocation.
Method: Finite element analysis was used after establishment of a first tarsometatarsal joint
fracture-dislocation model. Two implant simulations using a locking plate and five-hole 1/4 tubular
plate were designed to simulate fixation of the fracture-dislocation. The displacement of the first
tarsometatarsal articular surface and the stress distribution in the implants were calculated.
Results: A 700-N load was applied to both models. The minimum displacement of the articular
surface in the locking plate and 1/4 tubular plate model was 0.6471 mm and 0.3833 mm,
respectively. The maximum principal stress in the locking plate and 1/4 tubular plate was
1.212 Â 103 MPa and 1.107 Â 103 MPa, respectively.
Conclusion: Use of a 1/4 tubular plate is recommended for fixation of first tarsometatarsal joint
fracture-dislocation after consideration of other factors such as economical issues.

alignment of the midfoot and ensure load
transfer from the forefoot to the midfoot.1 A
plate might be a good choice for fixation of the
first TMT joint, especially for comminuted
fractures of the articular surface that cannot
be fixed with screws. However, the most
suitable type of plate remains controversial.
An improper implant may cause changes in
the local biomechanical environment of the
feet, leading to complications such as implant
breakage, loss of reduction, and malunion.2
Therefore, the biomechanical characteristics
of different plates must be evaluated.
Biomechanical research of the irregularly
shaped first TMT joint is difficult using
corpse specimens.3 Therefore, a three-
dimensional (3D) model of first TMT joint
fracture-dislocation was established by finite
element analysis (FEA), and fixation was
simulated using two kinds of plates: a lock-
ing plate (DARCO Modular Forefoot
System UPS 2.7 Plate; Wright Medical
Group, Memphis, TN, USA) and a five-
hole 1/4 tubular plate (Kanghui Medical,
Changzhou, China). The aim of this study
was to determine the displacement of the
articular surface and the stress distribution
of each plate and thus provide experimental
evidence for the choice of plate when repair-
ing first TMT joint injuries.
Methods
General data
A 35-year-old healthy male Chinese volunteer
(height, 170 cm; weight, 70kg) was recruited.
Physical and X-ray examinations of his foot
showed no deformities or damage. The vol-
unteer provided written informed consent
regarding the potential radiation hazard.
The experiment was approved by the Ethics
Committee of Ningbo No. 2 Hospital.
Equipment and software
The following equipment and software
were used in the present study: (1) a 4D
dual-source CT system (Siemens, Erlangen,
Germany), (2) Mimics 12.0 (Materialise,
Leuven, Belgium), (3) Geomagic Studio
(Geomagic, Morrisville, NC, USA), (4)
SolidWorks 2010 (Dassault Syste
` mes, Ve
´ lizy-
Villacoublay, France), and (5) ANSYS 13.0
(ANSYS Ltd., Canonsburg, PA, USA).
Experimental method
The 4D dual-source CT system was used to
scan the volunteer from the lower segment
of the leg to the whole foot in the neutral
position. The original CT image data were
loaded into Mimics 12.0 to obtain a 3D
model of the foot. After optimization, the
model was loaded into ANSYS 13.0 to
obtain a 3D FEA model of the foot with
66,540 nodes and 349,475 units. The mater-
ials in the model were simplified as homo-
geneous elastic materials. The thickness of
the cortical bone was set at 2 mm, and the
ligaments and plantar fascia were estab-
lished by a two-node truss unit. The model
of the foot was then loaded into
SolidWorks 2010 to simulate cutting off
the dorsal and plantar ligaments between
the medial cuneiform and first metatarsal
and performing an osteotomy along the
articular surface of the first TMT joint, thus
creating a first TMT joint intra-articular
fracture model.4
The geometric parameters of the plates
and screws were loaded into SolidWorks
2010, and two implant models were estab-
lished according to the experiment. The
locking plate was placed on the dorsal side
of the first TMT joint, and trans-articular
fixation was performed with four locking
screws that were respectively fixed to the
plate according to the designed directions.
The five-hole 1/4 tubular plate was also
placed on the dorsal side of the first TMT
joint, and trans-articular fixation was per-
formed with four cortical screws perpen-
dicular to the plate with two screws on each
side of the joint.

According to the mechanism of TMT
joint injury, the ankle was fixed at 30 of
plantar flexion. We set the lowest contact
point of the tibia and fibula and the head of
the first metatarsal with the ground as the
constraint point. The load was 700 N in
accordance with the body weight. The dir-
ection was set from the lower leg perpen-
dicular to the ground, while the reverse
direction was set in the head of the first
metatarsal. The tensile force caused by the
traction of the muscles and ligaments that
around the joint could be offset according to
the principle of the synthesis and decompos-
ition of the force.5
Results
Displacement of articular surface
After application of the 700-N load, both of
the plates provided firm fixation of the
model without breakage of the plates or
destruction of the model. However, the
articular surface still showed a tendency
toward dorsal dislocation in both models.
The maximum displacement in the locking
plate fixation model was 6.4710 mm, which
appeared in the first metatarsal head.
However, the minimum displacement in
this model was 0.6471 mm, which appeared
in the first TMT articular surface. The
maximum displacement in the 1/4 tubular
plate fixation model was 4.5990 mm, which
appeared in the first metatarsal head.
However, the minimum displacement in
this model was 0.3833 mm, which appeared
in the first TMT articular surface (Figure 1).
Stress distribution in both implants
After application of the 700-N load, a
balanced stress distribution was observed
in both the locking plate and 1/4 tubular
plate models. The maximum stress in the
locking plate model was 1.212 Â 103 MPa,
which was mainly concentrated in the holes
of the locking plate and in the locking
screws, especially on the side of the first
metatarsal, which supported more stress
than did the the side of the medial cunei-
form. The maximum stress in the 1/4 tubular
plate model was 1.107 Â 103 MPa, which
was also mainly concentrated in the holes
of the plate and in the screws on the side of
the first metatarsal (Figure 2).
Discussion
FEA is used for biomechanical research
because of its special advantage of high-
accuracy simulation of complex shapes and
material properties.6,7 In the present study,
the original data from the CT scan of the
foot was loaded into Mimics 12.0 software
to obtain an initial 3D model of the foot.
SolidWorks 2010 was then used to cleave the
model according to a Myerson classification
type B1 injury to obtain a model of first
TMT joint fracture-dislocation. ANSYS
13.0 can simulate operations and
assign physical properties to implants.
After loading, calculations could be carried
out to determine the displacement of the
articular surface and the stress distribution
in the implants. However, FEA also has
intrinsic limitations because the mechanical
properties of materials are defined as con-
tinuous, homogeneous, and isotropic; there-
fore, this assumption will be slightly
different from the real situation of the first
TMT joint itself.8,9
According to the mechanism of TMT
joint injury, the model was axially loaded at
30 of plantar flexion of the ankle. To more
accurately reflect the displacement of the
articular surface and stress distribution of
the implants, the fracture line and articular
surface were replaced and bonded by soft
material with a modulus of elasticity of
5 MPa and Poisson ratio of 0.40, and the
titanium plate and screws were replaced with
a material with a modulus of elasticity of
200 GPa and Poisson ratio of 0.28. After
loading, the results showed that the

displacement of the articular surface was
<2 mm in both models, indicating that both
of the implants could provide firm fix-
ation.10 However, the articular surface still
showed a tendency toward dorsal disloca-
tion in both models. In the locking plate
fixation model, the minimum displacement
of the articular surface was 0.6471 mm,
while it was 0.3833 mm in the 1/4 tubular
plate fixation model. These results show that
the firm fixation provided by either the
locking plate or 1/4 tubular plate could
restore the normal anatomy and slight
mobility of the first TMT joint. According
to the FEA results, the maximum displace-
ments were located in the in the head of the
first metatarsal bone in both models.
Therefore, in patients with a first TMT
joint injury, it is advisable to avoid weight
bearing on the foot regardless of whether the
implants are fixed. Continued weight bear-
ing may cause instability of the first ray,
leading to complications such as metatar-
salgia, plantar fasciitis, and pressure ulcer
formation.11
The stress distribution in the implants
was balanced in both the locking plate
and 1/4 tubular plate models. The
implants exhibit a certain stress-shielding
effect, which is beneficial for early fracture
healing and early functional exercise with-
out weight bearing.12 In the present study,
the maximum stress in the locking
plate and 1/4 tubular plate were
1.212 Â 103 MPa and 1.107 Â 103 MPa,
respectively, and mainly concentrated in
the holes of the plates and screws, espe-
cially on the side of the first metatarsal.
Thus, the stress was slightly larger in the
locking plate than in the 1/4 tubular plate,
and the locking plate could accordingly
provide a greater stress-shielding effect. A
certain stress-shielding effect may be bene-
ficial to a fracture, but it can become
detrimental if the stress-shielding effect is
too strong because it may result in
implant breakage and fracture nonunion.13
Therefore, the patient should avoid weight
bearing on the foot when an implant is
present in the first TMT joint. It is advisable
to remove the plate if the patient wants to
walk or run after the first TMT joint injury
has healed.14 During removal of the implant,
surgeons should pay close attention to the
holes of the plates and screws, where the
stress is more concentrated.
The main factor affecting the prognosis of
TMT joint injury is maintenance of the
congruity of the articular surface by
implants. Many kinds of implants can be
used for fixation of the TMT joint.
However, K-wires are considered useless
for fixation of the first TMT joint because
they cannot provide solid fixation.15 Staples
are more suitable for fixation of TMT joint
subluxation.16 Occasionally, in some cases
of comminuted TMT joint fracture-disloca-
tion, the use of cannulated screws will
eventually lead to failure of the fixation
because the guide pin cannot be drilled
though the articular surface. Therefore, a
plate might be the most suitable implant in
this situation. In the present study, we
evaluated both a locking plate and 1/4
tubular plate. The results showed that both
of the plates were suitable for fixation of first
TMT joint fracture-dislocation. The locking
plate used in this study was the DARCO
Modular Forefoot System UPS 2.7 Plate,
which is mainly used for fusion of the
forefoot; however, it can also be used for
fixation of forefoot fractures.17 Compared
with the 1/4 tubular plate used in this study,
it had no obvious advantages in fixing a
fracture-dislocation over a comminuted
fracture-dislocation. Furthermore, a
locking plate may cost more than a 1/4
tubular plate in many developing coun-
tries.18,19 Therefore, fixation of first TMT
joint fracture-dislocation using a 1/4 tubular
plate is more suitable than using a locking
plate with respect to both biomechanical
and economical factors and can be widely
used in the clinical setting.
