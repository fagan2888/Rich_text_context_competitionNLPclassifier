To separate age and cohort effects on decline in normal cognitive aging, we applied growth curve models to
longitudinal data from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging. Data from up to five measurement waves
covering a 16-year period were available from 806 participants (age 50 to 88 at the first wave). We divided the
sample into two cohorts by birth year: 1900­1925 and 1926­1948. We generated components to tap four cognitive
domains: verbal and spatial ability, memory, and speed. We tested cohort differences by using two growth
models: quadratic and two linear slopes. Results indicated significant cohort differences in average performance
at age 67.5 for all components except speed. When we compared linear slopes during the same age range (age 62­
78), we found no cohort differences. Trajectories of change with age in these four domains were fundamentally the
same in middle-old age for individuals born during the first half of the 20th century.
ONE of the primary challenges facing researchers in cogni-
tive aging is to isolate true age changes from the con-
founding effects of time and cohort. It has long been observed
that cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of cognitive aging
do not always suggest the same patterns of change with age in
cognitive abilities (e.g., Schaie, 2005; Schaie & Hofer, 2001;
Sliwinski & Hofer, 1999). Moreover, time-lag studies indicate
significant cohort differences in intelligence. Dramatic in-
creases in IQ test scores over the past century, known as the
Flynn effect, have been documented in many countries (Flynn,
1987; Kaufman, 2001; Neisser, 1998; Rodgers, 1999; Wicherts
et al., 2004). Depending on the trait in question, younger
cohorts exhibit both superior and inferior performance on mea-
sures of cognitive functioning (Bowles, Grimm, & McArdle,
2005; Ro
¨nnlund, Nyberg, Ba
¨ckman, & Nilsson, 2005; Uttle &
Van Alstine, 2003).
One method for advancing our understanding of cohort ef-
fects on cognitive aging is to examine cohort differences in
aging trajectories for various cognitive abilities. In addition to
testing cohort differences in average performance, latent growth
curve models allow us to investigate cohort differences in
average rates of decline with age (McArdle & Anderson, 1990;
Muthen & Khoo, 1998). For example, a recent analysis com-
pared average performance and rates of decline in basic and
advanced vocabulary skills across three cohorts: 1920­1939,
1940­1959, 1960­1979 (Bowles et al., 2005). The authors
reported faster decline in older cohorts for advanced vocabulary
knowledge, but faster decline in younger cohorts for basic
vocabulary knowledge. Using data from a cohort-sequential
study of aging, Reynolds, Finkel, Gatz, and Pedersen (2002)
compared time-based growth curve models in adults older or
younger than 65 years at the first measurement occasion.
Estimates of intercept and linear slope over time differed
markedly between age groups for all three variables: block
design, picture memory, and digit symbol. The conclusions that
researchers make about cohort differences in cognitive aging
may differ depending on whether they use time-based or age-
based models, even if they use entry age as a covariate, because
the time predictor may reflect additional factors beyond aging
processes, including retest and attrition effects (Sliwinski &
Buschke, 1999).
Our goal in the current analysis is to expand on previous
investigations of cohort differences in cognitive aging. Data
from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA;
Finkel & Pedersen, 2004), an ongoing cohort-sequential study
of aging twins, allows us to examine cohort differences in tra-
jectories of aging in multiple domains of cognitive functioning
by using an age-based growth curve model. The sample can
be divided into two cohorts to allow comparisons of aging
trajectories for individuals born during the first and second
quarters of the 20th century. Five testing occasions provide
sufficient data to support estimation of both linear and quadratic
rates of decline in the growth curve models. Because SATSA
includes extensive cognitive assessment, cohort comparisons
can be made for cognitive functioning in four domains: verbal
and spatial ability, memory, and processing speed.
Many researchers and theorists have highlighted the range of
social, historical, and cultural forces that can and often do differ
between cohorts (e.g., Riley, Foner, & Riley, 1999; Schaie,
2005; Settersten, 2006). Clearly, these forces can impact the
cognitive aging process, resulting in cohort differences in the
trajectories of aging. Although identifying the specific factors
that impact cohort differences in cognitive aging is important,
the first step is to describe cohort differences in aging trajec-
tories. Within the growth curve model, there are two ways in
which cognitive aging could differ between cohorts: intercept
and rate of decline. Cohort differences in the forces that
impinge on cognitive abilities could produce an initial cohort
difference in cognitive performance that is then maintained as
aging progresses. In other words, although average perfor-
mance may differ, the rate of decline could be the same across
cohorts. Salthouse (2006) refers to this phenomenon as pre-
served differentiation: The difference between cohorts in aver-
age performance is maintained throughout the aging life span,
resulting in parallel aging trajectories. In contrast, the multiple
forces that influence the aging process could impact both

average performance and rate of decline. It is possible that the
same factor that contributes to higher average performance also
contributes to more successful maintenance of that performance
over the life span. The result is differential preservation
(Salthouse): Cognitive abilities may be better preserved in one
cohort than in the other cohort. The difference in preservation
of cognitive functioning leads to differential rates of decline
and thus divergent aging trajectories.
The results of previous cross-sectional comparisons allow us
to make predictions about cohort differences in average
performance; therefore, we expect cohort differences in the
intercept of the growth curve model in all four cognitive
domains, with higher average performance in the younger
cohort (Bowles et al., 2005; Flynn, 1987; Reynolds et al., 2002;
Schaie, 2005). Conclusions from cross-sectional data may not
transfer to predictions about cohort differences in cognitive
decline, however (e.g., Riley et al., 1999; Schaie & Hofer,
2001; Sliwinski & Hofer, 1999), and few studies of have
reported analyses of cohort differences in rates of decline in
cognitive performance. Two-component theories of intelligence
(Horn, 1988; Horn & Cattell, 1966; Lindenberger, 2001)
predict greater cultural impact on aging trajectories for aging-
resilient (i.e., crystallized) abilities than for age-sensitive (i.e.,
fluid) abilities. Given cohort differences in cultural experience
(cf., Riley et al.; Settersten, 2006), two-component theories of
intelligence suggest that crystallized abilities (including verbal
ability and memory) would follow the differential preservation
hypothesis and exhibit faster rates of decline in the older cohort.
Previous cohort comparisons of rates of decline in vocabulary
provide only partial support for the differential preservation
hypothesis, however (Bowles et al.).
Spatial abilities and processing speed are generally consid-
ered components of fluid intelligence (e.g., Birren & Fisher,
1995; e.g., Lindenberger, Mayr, & Kleigl, 1993; Salthouse,
1996), although processing speed can be conceptualized as
a separate construct (e.g., Cattell, 1971; Horn & Hofer, 1992;
Schaie, 2005). Previous growth curve comparisons report sig-
nificant age group differences in rates of decline for processing
speed and spatial ability (Reynolds et al., 2002). However, two-
component theories of intelligence hypothesize small cultural
effects for measures of fluid abilities (Lindenberger, 2001).
Therefore, it is possible that any cohort differences in expe-
rience will have no impact on rates of decline for measures of
fluid abilities, providing support for the preserved differentia-
tion hypothesis.
METHODS
Participants
Ascertainment procedures for SATSA have been described
previously. In brief, the sample is a subset of twins from the
population-based Swedish Twin Registry (Finkel & Pedersen,
2004). The base population comprises all pairs of twins who
indicated that they had been separated before the age of 11 and
reared apart, and a sample of twins reared together who were
matched on the basis of gender and date and county of birth.
Twins were mailed questionnaires, and a sample of those twin
pairs who were aged 50 years or older in which both twins
responded was invited to participate in an additional in-person
examination of health and cognitive abilities (Pedersen et al.,
1991). In-person testing (IPT1) took place in a location
convenient to the twins. Testing was completed during a single
4-hour visit. The second and third waves of in-person testing
(IPT2 and IPT3) occurred after 3-year intervals. In-person
testing did not occur during Wave 4; therefore, the next wave of
in-person testing is labeled IPT5 and occurred after a 7-year
interval (see Finkel & Pedersen). The fifth wave of in-person
testing (IPT6) took place 3 years after IPT5.
Dementia status was determined by clinical diagnosis based
on current diagnostic criteria (Gatz, et al., 1997), and in the
current analyses we did not include participants who developed
dementia at any point during their participation. The number of
participants at each in-person testing occasion who remained
free of dementia as of IPT5 is 594, 558, 538, 516, and 441. In
total, 806 nondemented individuals had cognitive data available
from at least one testing occasion. In the older cohort, 59% of
participants are women and 41% are men; in the younger
cohort, 58% are women and 42% are men.
The median birth year of the individuals in the sample was
1924. However, participants were recruited into the Swedish
Twin Registry in two waves: twins born in 1925 and earlier and
twins born after 1925 (Lichtenstein et al., 2002). Therefore, we
defined two cohorts on the basis of the recruitment phases:
individuals born between 1900 and 1925 (n ¼ 425) and
individuals born between 1926 and 1948 (n ¼ 381; see the end
note at the end of this article). Sample sizes and age ranges in
each cohort at each testing wave are presented in Figure 1. On
the left side of the figure, truncation at age 50 is evident in the
younger cohort. On the right side, subject mortality is evident in
the upper limits of the age ranges in the older cohorts. In
SATSA, education is rated on a 4-point scale from 1 (elementary
school) to 4 (university or higher). Mean education was 1.75 in
the younger cohort and 1.48 in the older cohort. This is
a statistically significant difference, at t(804) ¼À3.95, p , .01.

COHORT DIFFERENCES IN COGNITIVE AGING P287
In our current analyses we focus on cohort comparisons of
individual performance, making it necessary for us to eliminate
any bias resulting from the inclusion of twins. We fit all models
to a sample that included a randomly selected member of each
twin pair; this is Sample A. We then replicated analyses in a
sample consisting of the other member of each twin pair; this is
Sample B. We randomly assigned individuals from incomplete
pairs to either Sample A or Sample B.
Measures
Four cognitive domains are represented in the SATSA
cognitive test battery (see Nesselroade, Pedersen, McClearn,
Plomin, & Bergeman, 1988; Pedersen et al., 1992): verbal,
spatial, memory, and processing speed abilities. Verbal abilities
are tapped by tests on Information, Synonyms, and Analogies.
Figure Logic, Block Design, and Card Rotations tests assess
spatial abilities. Memory tests include Digit Span, Picture
Memory, and Names and Faces. Finally, Symbol Digit and
Figure Identification tests measure processing speed. Reliabil-
ities for these tests range from .82 to .96 (Pedersen et al.). We
used principal components analysis to construct latent compo-
nents from the individual tests within each domain: verbal,
spatial, memory, and speed. For the verbal, spatial, and speed
components, loadings ranged from .78 to .92 and the
components explained 74%, 67%, and 85% of the variance
among the individual measures. The memory component was
more diverse, including measures of short-term, long-term, and
picture memory. Loadings ranged from .64 to .78 and the
component explained 53% of the variance. Previous compar-
isons of component structure between cohorts and across
testing occasions indicate that the structure does not vary sys-
tematically across age or time (Finkel, Reynolds, McArdle, &
Pedersen, 2005a). To avoid the issue of measurement variance
(cf. Wicherts et al., 2004), we created an invariant definition
of components at each testing occasion by standardizing the
cognitive measures relative to the respective means and
variances at IPT1, and we used the loadings from the principal
components analyses conducted at IPT1 to construct the verbal,
spatial, and memory components. We combined the speed
measures into a speed component by using unit weighting.
Finally, for ease of interpretation, we translated all component
scores into T scores, using means and variances from IPT1.
Statistical Method
We used a growth curve model to examine cohort differences
in cognitive aging. The structural model can be considered as
a multilevel random coefficients model (Bryk & Raudenbush,
1992; Laird & Ware, 1982; McArdle & Anderson, 1990).
The model provides estimation of fixed effects, that is, fixed
population parameters as estimated by the average growth
model of the entire sample, and random effects, that is, inter-
individual variability in intraindividual change in growth model
parameters. Growth curve models take into account missing
data by giving more weight to individuals with the most
time points.
Figure 2 presents a general form of the growth models that
we used in these analyses. Individual scores at any one time are
a function of a latent intercept (I), practice or retest effects (P),
the first age basis (B1
), the second age basis (B2
), and random
error (u0
­u4
). Note that I*, B1
*, and B2
* refer to the
standardized scores of I, B1
, and B2
. Standardized practice
effects can also be included; however, previous analyses have
indicated no interindividual variance around mean practice
effects (Finkel et al., 2005a). The model-fitting procedure
entails fitting individual growth models to all available data;
repeated measurements are indicated by the y0
through y4
variables. Paths from practice to the observed scores indicate
that the entire practice effect was assumed to occur at the first
retest. The paths from the latent age basis parameters to the
observed scores are the age basis coefficients: B1
(t) and B2
(t).
The age basis serves as a marker for the age of the subject at
each time of measurement, adjusted for the centering age. The
random errors or uniquenesses (u0
­u4
) represent unaccounted
variation from fitting the growth model to the cognitive
measures; we constrained these time-specific residual variances
to be equal over time. The means (Mi ¼ mean intercept; Mp ¼
mean practice; Mb1
¼ mean first age basis; Mb2
¼ mean second
age basis) are the estimates of the average performance and
average amount of change. Standard deviations of the in-
terindividual differences in the intercept and change parameters
are indicated by Di, Db1
, and Db2
. Finally, the relationships
among the intercept and rates of change are represented by the
correlations Rib1
, Rib2
, and Rb1
b2
.
We used two versions of the growth model in the present
analyses; each model is defined by the manner in which the two
age bases were parameterized. First, we fit a quadratic model to
the data, setting B1
equal to the linear slope (age) and B2
equal

bases: B1

to accelerating changes with age (age2). We compared param-
eter estimates for intercept, slope, and quadratic terms across
cohorts. We estimated quadratic growth models and tested
cohort differences by using PROC Mixed with maximum like-
lihood estimation in SAS 8.0 (SAS Institute, 1999). However,
comparing quadratic growth models across the different age
ranges encompassed by each cohort does not adequately cap-
ture the overlapping age range that is covered by both cohorts
(i.e., ages 62­78). Therefore, in a second approach, we ex-
panded the standard linear growth model to include two linear
growth rates (Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992; Finkel, Reynolds,
McArdle, Gatz, & Pedersen, 2003): one linear slope before the
centering age and a separate linear slope after the centering age,
with the centering age acting as a pivot point. We estimated and
tested two-slope growth models in Mx by using maximum
likelihood estimation (Neale, Boker, Xie, & Maes, 2003).
It is important to note that one of the fundamental
assumptions of growth curve models is that data are missing
at random (MAR). Without complete mortality data, it is
difficult to establish whether the MAR assumption is met,
although previous investigations of SATSA data suggest that
participants who continue in the study are significantly different
from those who drop out (e.g., personality ratings; see Pedersen
& Reynolds, 1998). Of most importance in a comparison of
growth models across cohorts is to demonstrate that the pattern
of missing data does not differ between cohorts. Table 1
presents the participation rates in the two cohorts. We can see
that although the patterns are fairly similar, the older cohort
is somewhat more likely than the younger cohort to have at
least 3 time points simply as a result of a greater number of
opportunities for participation. However, in the overlapping age
interval where the two cohorts can be compared most directly
(age 62­78; see Figure 1), there was no significant difference
between the cohorts in the rate of missing data.
RESULTS
Quadratic Model
We used quadratic growth curve models to examine cohort
differences in both average performance and rate of change
with age. Age 67.5 was the centering age that we used for the
quadratic growth curve analyses, which we selected because it
crosses three of the five waves of measurement for each cohort.
First we tested three general models that examine cohort
differences in fixed effects (means) and random effects
(variances). In Model 1, we fit the quadratic growth model to
Sample A. In Model 2, we entered cohort as a covariate in the
model, allowing the fixed effects (mean intercept, mean prac-
tice, mean slope, and mean quadratic terms) to differ between
cohorts. In Model 3, we also allowed random effects to differ
between cohorts: intercept, slope, and quadratic variance and
correlation terms, as well as residual variance. We compared
the three nested models by using the difference chi-square test
obtained by taking the difference between the model fits [i.e.,
À2 ln(likelihood)] and testing its significance with the degrees
of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters
of the two models. Comparing Models 1 and 2 provided an
omnibus test of cohort differences in average performance and
average rate of change, and comparing Models 2 and 3
provided an omnibus test of cohort differences in interindivid-
ual differences in the parameters. Parameters estimates from
Model 2 and model fit statistics are presented in Table 2. We
repeated all analyses and model comparisons in Sample B; the
results of model testing in Sample B were consistent with the
results presented here. For all four cognitive components,
model comparison indicated a significant cohort difference in
the fixed effects of the quadratic model. In contrast, model
comparison failed to indicate any cohort differences in the
interindividual differences in the quadratic model. Therefore,
we constrained random effects to be equal across cohorts for the
remaining analyses of quadratic growth curves.
Following the omnibus test of cohort differences in fixed
effects, we tested the significance of cohort differences in

individual growth curve parameters in an additive manner. In
Model 4, only the intercept differed between cohorts, and we
compared model fit with Model 1. In Model 5, both intercept
and practice differed between cohorts, and we compared model
fit with Model 4. Model 6 included separate cohort estimates
for intercept, practice, and linear slope; Model 7 included
separate cohort estimates for intercept, practice, linear slope,
and the quadratic term. (Model 7 is identical to Model 2; both
allow cohort differences in all fixed effects. Note that testing the
growth parameters independently produced the same results as
did the additive method described.)
The resulting changes in fit between these nested models are
provided in Table 3. The quadratic growth curves estimated by
Model 2 (allowing cohort differences in all fixed effects) are
presented in Figure 3. For the verbal, spatial, and memory
components, the results follow the same pattern: significant
cohort differences in the intercept and quadratic term, but no
significant differences in practice or linear slope. The intercept
estimates the average performance at the centering age, and
performance on the verbal, spatial, and memory components at
age 67.5 is significantly lower in the older cohort. The older
cohort also demonstrated a more negative quadratic estimate
(faster decline) than the younger cohort for these three
components. We found a very different pattern of results for
the speed component. The only significant cohort difference
was in the significantly smaller practice term in the older
cohort: The average performance and rates of age-related
decline for the processing speed component did not differ
significantly between the two cohorts.
One concern with comparing quadratic growth curves across
the two cohorts is that the quadratic term estimates accelerating
decline across the entire age range. Given the differences
between cohorts in the completeness of the data, especially at
the ends of the age range (see Figure 1), the precision of the
growth curve models may not be comparable across cohorts.
Therefore, testing cohort differences in the quadratic parameter

may be functionally equivalent to comparing accelerating rates
of decline in middle and late adulthood. To examine cohort
differences in rates of decline, a more direct comparison of
decline in the same age range is required.
Two-Slope Model
The purpose of applying the two-slope model was to
compare rates of decline for the two cohorts precisely where
the age ranges overlap: ages 62 to 78. In the two-slope model,
the first age basis consists of the linear slope prior to the
centering age and the second age basis is the linear slope after
the centering age. To establish a linear slope in the same age
range in the separate cohorts for the purposes of cohort
comparison, we selected different centering ages on the basis of
the endpoints of the overlapping age range (62 and 78). We
centered the data at age 62 in the younger cohort. Consequently,
Slope 1 indicates average linear change with age between
ages 50 and 62, and Slope 2 indicates average linear change
with age between ages 62 and 78. In the older cohort, we
centered the data at age 78; therefore, Slope 1 covered ages 62
to 78 and Slope 2 covered ages 78 to 94. As a result, Slope 2 in
the younger cohort and Slope 1 in the older cohort both covered
the overlapping age range of 62 to 78 years. We fit the two-
slope growth models separately in the two cohorts, and we
compared two models. First, we fit the full model, estimating
separate intercept, practice, Slope 1, and Slope 2 in each cohort,
to the data. In the second model, we constrained Slope 2 in the
younger cohort to be equal to Slope 1 in the older cohort.
Model fitting in Mx was required to model this incongruous
constraint between the two cohorts. Given the differences in
centering ages, interindividual variances were not constrained
to be equal across cohorts. We again compared the two nested
models by using the difference chi-square test.
The parameter estimates from the full two-slope model and
the results of model fitting are presented in Table 4. As the
focus of the two-slope model was comparison of mean slopes,
the 11 variance, covariance, and residual variance estimates
in each cohort are not reported here but are available from
D. Finkel upon request. Parameter estimates for intercept and
practice will differ between Tables 2 and 4 because of the
difference in centering ages: intercept and practice parameters
indicate the average performance and average practice effects at
the centering age. The two-slope growth curves estimated for
each cohort are presented in Figure 4. We fit all models in
Sample A and we repeated model fitting in Sample B; results in
the two samples were consistent and the results from Sample A
are reported. The differences in intercept indicated by the
quadratic growth curve analysis are still evident in the two-
slope models presented in Figure 4. For verbal, spatial, and
memory variables, there is a clear separation of the decline
trajectories for the two cohorts. In addition, all slope estimates
reported in Table 4 are significantly different from zero, with
the exception of slope estimates in the 50­62 age interval in the
younger cohort for the verbal and memory components.
However, as the model-fitting results presented at the bottom
of Table 4 indicate, there are no significant cohort differences in
the average rate of decline in the overlapping age range.
DISCUSSION
Our goal in the current analysis was to examine possible
cohort differences in trajectories of decline for cognitive
variables, as separate from cohort differences in average
performance. We applied two parameterizations of a growth
model to the data: a quadratic model estimating linear and
accelerating decline and a two-slope model estimating decline
in two linear components before and after a midpoint. We
estimated cohort differences in the average performance in the
quadratic approach, and we examined cohort differences in
average age-related rates of decline by using both the quadratic
and two-slope growth models.
Average Performance
By comparing the intercept of the quadratic growth model
across cohorts, we found that the average performance was one
third to one half of a standard deviation lower in the older
cohorts in three of the four cognitive domains: verbal ability,
spatial ability, and memory. We found no significant cohort
differences in average performance for processing speed. It is
important to note that the magnitude of cohort differences in
average performance will depend on the centering age used in
the growth model; general conclusions may be drawn but
interpretations of the size of the cohort difference should be
made with caution. Previous analyses of the Flynn effect
suggest small cohort effects for verbal ability (Flynn, 1987), but
investigations focusing on vocabulary typically report large
cohort differences in samples with 40- to 80-year ranges in birth
years (Bowles et al., 2005; Schaie, 2005; Uttle & Van Alstine,
2003), and Kaufman (2001) reported large cohort differences
for both the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) verbal
IQ and a verbal comprehension index. Similarly, in the present
analyses, cohort differences in average performance were
significant for the verbal component. It is likely that the cohort
differences in education found in this sample are responsible for
at least part of the cohort difference in verbal ability, but
previous analyses indicate that 20th-century trends in education
do not fully explain cohort differences in verbal ability (e.g.,
Alwin & McCammon, 2001; Kaufman; Finkel, Reynolds,
McArdle, & Pedersen, 2005b).

COHORT DIFFERENCES IN COGNITIVE AGING P291
On the basis of previous investigations, we predicted
significant cohort effects for memory and spatial ability, and
these predictions were supported. We found no cohort differ-
ences in average performance for processing speed. A com-
parison of WAIS-R and WAIS-III data also found no cohort
differences for performance IQ or for indices of perceptual
organization and processing speed (Kaufman, 2001). Results
from the Seattle Longitudinal Study also report some cohort
differences for measures of perceptual speed, although the
magnitude of those differences is smallest for Identical
Pictures, the task that is most similar to the Figure Identification
component of the processing speed component used here
(Schaie, 2005). In addition, other tasks with a substantial speed
component (e.g., Word Fluency) exhibit little or no cohort
differences. Two-component theories of cognitive aging
predict smaller cohort differences for age-sensitive abilities
such as processing speed (Horn, 1988; Horn & Cattell, 1966;
Lindenberger, 2001). These results may indicate that slowing
of perceptual speed is a component of primary aging, funda-
mental to the aging process and shaped very little by cohort or
cultural factors.
Rates of Decline
Comparing average performance across cohorts fails to
capture the dynamic processes of change that occur with
cognitive aging. With cohort-sequential data, we can focus not
only on interindividual differences in performance but on
cohort differences in intraindividual change over time (Baltes &
Nesselroade, 1979). Therefore, the primary focus of the current
analysis was to investigate cohort differences in trajectories of
decline for cognitive measures. We applied both quadratic and
two-slope growth models to the data and, as is often the case in
aging research, the form of the question affected the outcome.
Although the quadratic model estimates accelerating age
changes across the entire age range of the sample, the cohorts
differed in the distribution of data available to support the
parameter estimates. As a result, examining cohort differences
in quadratic parameters in the two cohorts functionally com-
pares aging trajectories defined by young-old and old-old age. It
is not surprising, then, that significant cohort differences in
accelerating decline were found for verbal, spatial, and memory
abilities. In contrast, no cohort differences in the quadratic
parameter were found for processing speed. Therefore, we can
conclude that the average rate of decline in processing speed is
fundamentally the same across cohorts.
Applying the two-slope growth model to the issue of cohort
differences in rates of decline allowed us to make direct cohort
comparisons of decline in the same age range: ages 62 to 78. In
that age range, no significant cohort differences in rates of de-
cline were identified for any of the cognitive domains assessed.

In their comparison of longitudinal trends in vocabulary across
three cohorts, Bowles and colleagues (2005) did not constrain
their models to compare aging trajectories in the same age
range. Even so, their results indicate cohort differences in
average performance, but not in the rates of decline in the age
ranges for which the cohorts overlap (ages 35­45 and 55­65).
Taken together, these results are in direct opposition to theories
of cohort differences in cognitive functioning based primarily
on investigations of average performance. Cohort differences in
average performance on cognitive tasks have been strongly
supported by several studies, including the present quadratic
growth curve analysis. The absence of cohort differences in
linear aging trajectories, however, suggests preserved differ-
entiation: Initial cohort differences in cognitive performance are
maintained throughout the aging process. There is a growing
body of evidence for preserved differentiation in cognitive
aging. For example, although researchers find the expected sex
differences in average performance, they report few sex dif-
ferences in rates of decline for measures of cognitive ability
(Aartsen, Martin, & Zimprich, 2004; Caskie, Schaie, & Willis,
1999; Finkel, Reynolds, Pedersen, & Berg, 2006; MacDonald,
Hultsch, Strauss, & Dixon, 2003). Similarly, Salthouse (2006)
reports that, although mental exercise impacts average perfor-
mance, there is no evidence to date that it results in differential
preservation of cognitive abilities (i.e., differential rates of
decline).
In the current investigation, the fundamental nature of these
conclusions is restricted by the limited amount of overlap in the
age ranges covered by the two cohorts (only 16 years) and by
the focus on linear decline when the life-span aging trajectories
are primarily quadratic in nature. Furthermore, the use of time-
based, as opposed to event-based, cohorts may have limited
substantive interpretation of the results. Although it is easy to
pinpoint the date of events that may impact functioning (e.g.,
the 1918 influenza epidemic in Sweden), determining the point
in the life span when the impact of the event will be strongest is
not a simple matter (Alwin, Hofer, & McCammon, 2006).
Therefore, with regard to the impact on cognitive decline in the
second half of the life span, event-based cohort definition may
be as arbitrary as time-based cohort definition. Additional sup-
port for the absence of cohort differences in aging trajectories
would be provided by comparisons of growth models from
cohorts that differ more dramatically than the cohorts used in
the present analyses, such as the first and second halves of the
20th century. In summary, the current analyses indicate that the
dramatic social, historical, and cultural differences between
cohorts (Riley et al., 1999; Schaie, 2005; Settersten, 2006)
impact average performance on cognitive tasks, but they do not
result in cohort differences in the preservation of cognitive
functioning during the second half of the life span. Clearly,
interindividual differences in cognitive aging exist (e.g., Finkel
et al., 2003), and identifying the factors that contribute to
slower rates of decline and thus more successful aging
continues to be of paramount importance.

END NOTES
Although time-based cohorts are typically smaller than 25 years,
previous growth curve analyses of cognitive aging have used
cohorts of 20 years or larger (Bowles et al., 2005; Reynolds et al.,
2002). In addition, dividing the sample into only two cohorts
maximized the power to detect cohort differences. It is also possible
to divide the sample into cohorts on the basis of historical events,
such as the influenza epidemic of 1918 or the Great Depression
(1929). To examine of the impact of dividing the cohorts at different
birth years, we repeated the analyses twice: once with the cohorts
divided at 1918 (1900­1918, 1919­1945) and once with the cohorts
divided at 1929 (1900­1928, 1929­1948). We replicated the
general model-fitting results reported in the text.
