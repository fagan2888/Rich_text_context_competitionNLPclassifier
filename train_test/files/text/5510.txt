Background
A significant health gap exists between Indigenous and non-
Indigenous people in Australia. At last census, Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander people made up around 2% of the
23.5 million population of Australia (Australian Bureau of
Statistics [ABS], 2013). Around a third of Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander people live in major Australian cities
and around a fifth (100,000) live in remote or very remote
areas defined by their distance to service centers (Australian
Institute of Health and Welfare [AIHW], 2004) some literally
thousands of kilometers from service centers--defined as
urban centers with population clusters over 1,000 people
(ABS, 2012). There are around 1,100 remote Indigenous
communities (RIC) in Australia. Just under half of these RIC
consist of less than 20 people but most people (72%) live in
communities of 200 people or more and larger communities
consist of several thousand people (ABS, 2003). The facili-
ties available in remote communities vary depending upon
size but most include fuel supply, office, school, and health
clinic and a basic shop where people can purchase a range of
goods including food.
Furthermore, Indigenous Australians living in remote
communities carry a significant and disproportionate share
of the gap with the 26% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander people living in remote communities accounting for
40% of the health gap (Vos, Barker, Begg, Stanley, & Lopez,
2009). Inadequate or poor nutrition relates to four of the top
seven risk factors contributing to this gap: obesity, high
blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and low fruit and
vegetable intake (Vos, Barker, Stanley, & Lopez, 2007). Diet
is the leading risk of burden of disease for all Australians.
Poor nutrition in RIC relates to several factors. It has pre-
viously been argued that Indigenous Australians derive 95%
of energy intake from purchased foods (A. J. Lee, Bonson, &
Powers, 1996) with the remainder being sourced from tradi-
tional foods acquired through hunting and/or gathering. In
more recent work, the complexity of food provisioning in
remote communities has been acknowledged and whereas
once the community store tended to be the only retail source
of food in communities, independent takeout shops also exist
(Brimblecombe, Mackerras, Clifford, & O'Dea, 2006).
Sources of food supply in RIC vary and now include com-
munity care programs, school canteens, school breakfast and

Mapping Point-of-Purchase Influencers
of Food Choice in Australian Remote
Indigenous Communities: A Review of the
Literature
Joanna Henryks1 and Julie Brimblecombe2
Abstract
Closing the health gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians relies, in part, on addressing the poor levels of
nutrition in remote Indigenous communities (RIC). This article identifies and maps key influencers of food choice at the
point-of-purchase (POP) in Australian RIC and identifies gaps in our knowledge. It is based on a narrative review of the
literature pertaining to food in RIC from a range of disciplinary perspectives including nutrition, ethnography, public health,
anthropology, and remote health to map POP drivers of food choice. In particular, the role of habit is identified as a key factor
that has previously not been discussed in the literature. The conceptual framework can be used as a basis for future POP
research in RIC and provides guidance for social marketers, public health, nutrition, and policy workers operating in this field.

lunch programs, independently managed stores and takeouts,
and food sources from hunting and gathering (Brimblecombe
et al., 2006; Schouten, Lindeman, & Reid, 2013). Although
we acknowledge that the community store is not necessarily
the main source of food supply in a remote community, it is
likely to be a major source.
Current food consumption in remote communities is a
diet dominated by highly processed foods and characterized
by high levels of sugar (predominantly from sugar-sweet-
ened beverages [SSB] and table sugar), low intake of fruit
and vegetables coupled with excessive sodium intake, and
deficiency in a number of micronutrients (Brimblecombe,
Ferguson, Liberato, & O'Dea, 2013). Similar high levels of
SSB (>250 g/d) have been reported in remote Aboriginal
communities, ranging from 298 to 497 g per day according to
totalcommunityfoodanddrinkpurchasedata(Brimblecombe,
Ferguson, Liberato, & O'Dea, 2013), as that reported for
Australian children aged 2 to 16 years (436 g/d; Clifton,
Chan, Moss, Miller, & Cobiac, 2011). Levels of fruit and
vegetable intake of 122 g to 247 g per person reported across
three remote Northern Territory communities are around a
quarter of the recommended intake of 675 g, 300 g from fruit
(two pieces of fruit weighing 150 g each) and 375 g from
vegetables (five pieces of vegetables weighting 75 g;
National Health and Medical Research Council [NHMRC],
2013).
Inconsistent access to quality fruit and vegetables and
high prices are some of the reasons for the low rates of con-
sumption (Council of Australian Governments [COAG],
2009; Meedeniya, Smith, & Carter, 2000). The issue of
access is discussed below; however, price as a consumption
barrier is currently being investigated by the Menzies School
of Health Research in their NHMRC-funded SHOP@RIC
project. This study is investigating the link between pricing
and healthy food purchasing through assessing the effects of
a price subsidy on certain healthy food items or through a
combination of the price subsidy and an in-store nutrition
education strategy (Brimblecombe, Ferguson, Liberato, Ball,
et al., 2013).
Consumers in RIC face many challenges and barriers in
relation to healthy food provisioning and consumption.
Many of the external and environmental factors accounting
for food choice in RIC have been linked to issues of poverty
(see, for example, Brimblecombe et al., 2014; Brimblecombe
& O'Dea, 2009; Carson, Dunbar, & Chenhall, 2007;
Drewnowski & Darmon, 2005; Saethre, 2005), and while not
wanting to minimize the profound impact of poverty on healthy
food choice and consumption, further research to understand
decision making and behavior at the point-of-purchase (POP)
will add another perspective to the task of addressing food-
related issues in RIC. These challenges to some extent have
been explored from different disciplinary perspectives and
have included anthropology (for example, Saethre, 2005),
nutrition (Brimblecombe et al., 2014; Brimblecombe, Liddle,
& O'Dea, 2012), economics (Campbell, 2013) and public
health (Brimblecombe & O'Dea, 2009), and a research
method approach--action research (Adams et al., 2012).
An area that could contribute different frameworks for
exploring these challenges is social marketing. Through
incorporating "other approaches," social marketers can draw
on the broad range of literature rather than just focusing on a
silo approach to challenges, as can often be the case in
addressing challenges faced by RIC. Any social marketing
program that seeks to address the influence of POP on peo-
ple's food choices in RIC will need to take into account the
environmental, social/cultural, store level, and individual
factors to develop a strategy which encompasses upstream,
midstream, and downstream approaches. Social marketing
practice has tended toward a binary approach: upstream or
downstream (Russell-Bennett, Wood, & Previte, 2013).
Midstream approaches, although not entirely ignored (see,
for example, Sacks, Swinburn, & Lawrence, 2009) are not
often considered. We would argue that all three approaches
need to be used to facilitate long-term change in healthier
eating practices in RIC.
A narrative literature review was undertaken to map the
influencers of food choice in RIC. This form of literature
review is useful "when attempting to link many studies . . .
for the purposes of reinterpretation or interconnection" and
consequently it is a "valuable theory building technique"
(Baumeister & Leary, 1997, p. 312). Scopus, Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander HealthInfoNet, Web of Knowledge,
and Google Scholar databases were searched. No date limits
were set but the literature search initially concluded in
November 2013 and was updated in August 2015. The fol-
lowing terms were used across all the databases: (Indigenous
or Aborig* or Torres Strait Islander) AND (remote commu-
nit*) AND (food). A search of the grey literature from gov-
ernment and non-government agencies was also undertaken.
In addition, reference lists of selected papers relevant to the
topic drivers of food choice at the POP in RIC were used as
further sources of information. The search was limited by the
dearth of available literature.
Papers were reviewed for factors that influenced con-
sumer choice at the POP either directly or indirectly. Factors
influencing food choice in RIC go beyond the store level and
for this reason they are explored to contextualize buying
behavior at the POP. Factors were separated into categories
adapted from social marketing approaches: upstream, mid-
stream, and downstream. These provide a useful framework
for understanding systems which impact individual decision
making.
Upstream Context
Upstream social marketing approaches focus on environ-
mental factors including the social determinants of health
(Donovan & Henley, 2010), food availability and choice, and
food price, as well as advocacy and lobbying to influence
policy (Gordon, 2011; Wymer, 2011). It also includes
Henryks and Brimblecombe 3
focusing on a range of actors that have an influence on the
environment of the target audience which can potentially
include politicians, local government policy-makers, media
figures, community activists, corporations, schools, and
foundations (Brimblecombe et al., 2015; N. R. Lee & Kotler,
2011, p. 147).
Policy.The Australian Government initiative Closing the
Gap has influenced and been a feature of health policy in the
Northern Territory and was a response to the Close the Gap
campaign organized by a coalition of Indigenous and non-
Indigenous health and community organizations (Oxfam
Australia, 2009). The campaign focuses on "closing the gap"
between non-Indigenous and Indigenous health outcomes by
2030. Unfortunately, some aspects of single policy efforts
have made little impact on improving nutrition at the popula-
tion level in RIC. For example, the Northern Territory Emer-
gency Response (NTER) income management policy
appeared to have no impact in its early stages of implementa-
tion on increasing people's purchasing of fruit and vegeta-
bles or decreasing purchasing of SSB (Brimblecombe et al.,
2010), both factors that contribute to health. Income man-
agement, in combination with the community stores licens-
ing program that addresses store infrastructure, food quality
and availability, may have (Australian National Audit Office
[ANAO], 2014; Cultural and Indigenous Research Centre
Australia [CIRCA], 2011). Rigorous evaluation of these
strategies is needed to provide the public and communities
with robust evidence on effect. Continued work in influenc-
ing policy needs to focus on housing issues that will improve
people's ability to prepare, cook, and store food. Health Hab-
itat has been instrumental in providing data to demonstrate
that poor design, construction, and a lack of routine mainte-
nance are central to people's abilities to store, prepare, and
cook food and not, as is currently perceived, damage by resi-
dents (Health Habitat, 2013).
Access to healthy food in remote communities was raised
as a concern in the National Strategy for Food Security in
Remote Indigenous Communities (COAG, 2009). If healthy
food is unavailable for purchase in a remote store, clearly it
cannot be consumed. The Stronger Futures in the Northern
Territory Act (2012) addressed concerns raised in the COAG
report through the Food Security component of the Act. This
is aimed at improving access to healthy food in remote com-
munities through the licensing of remote stores (the commu-
nity stores licensing program) and ensuring these stores
stock an appropriate range of healthy food, including a mini-
mum range of fruit and vegetables.
Availability and choice. The impact of policy upon availability
was noted in the previous section; however, food shortages
resulting from inability of stores to be replenished during the
wet season can also have an effect on food availability. A
recent study in one RIC found that food scarcity (not just
healthy food) had a significant effect on food purchases with
perishables, such as meat and fruit and vegetables, the most
affected categories of food--with mean sales dropping by
75% when the store could not be replenished due to wet sea-
son conditions (Scelza, 2012).
Some stores have made specific policies about what to
stock effectively resulting in choice editing. Choice editing
has been defined as "cutting out unnecessarily damaging
products and getting real sustainable choices on the shelves"
(Sustainable Consumption Roundtable, 2006, p. 2). This pro-
cess involves removing products from shelves which are not
sustainable. In the case of food, we can use the concept of
choice editing to support the removal of unhealthy food. An
example is the Mai Wiru Regional Stores Policy in the
Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands, South
Australia. This is a community-driven policy developed with
extensive community consultation and incorporating all
stakeholders. The policy aim was to address access to healthy
food in remote communities. Within this policy framework,
one community successfully removed the top three selling
sugar-sweetened drinks from their store to encourage a tran-
sition toward lower sugar or zero sugar based drinks and
resulted in an overall reduction in available kilojoules con-
sumed from SSB (Butler, Tapsell, & Lyons-Wall, 2011).
Recent research on the broader efforts of the Mai Wiru stores
to improve nutrition on the APY Lands found that despite the
decreased intake of sugar in this one store, overall diet qual-
ity across stores has decreased since 1986 and additional
ongoing resources are required to ensure diet quality
improves (Lee et al., 2015).
Store managers' attitudes and beliefs toward food in RIC
can influence the range of products stocked and their stock
management practices, which affect the choice, quality, and
availability of healthy food. For example, A. J. Lee, Bonson,
and Powers (1996) found that a perceived lack of consumer
"demand" was used to justify not stocking certain healthy
food as the manager claimed these foods were "unpopular."
This was in contrast to other communities in the study where
the managers focused on ensuring a quality supply of healthy
food, which did generate demand. Similarly, a review of
nutrition policy of the Arnhem Land Progress Association (a
retailing cooperative in the Arnhem Land, Northern
Australia) found that store managers' actions resulted in
varying levels of policy implementation across the commu-
nities (A. J. Lee, Hobson, & Katarski, 1996). Thus, despite
policy and legislation, there is still a degree of influence that
store managers have upon the range of products carried in
remote stores and this can potentially affect dietary intake as
well as influence habit formation.
Price. The price of food in RIC in the Northern Territory is
significantly higher than in Darwin or regional centers such
as Alice Springs. The annual Northern Territory Department
of Health Market Basket Survey found that the average cost
of a food basket in remote stores across the Territory was
$824 compared with $558 in supermarkets in major centers
4 SAGE Open
(e.g., Alice Springs, Darwin, and Katherine; Department of
Health [DoH], 2015). This price differential is even greater
when actual food purchasing data are used rather than that of
a hypothetical basket (60% vs. 53%). This price differential
means that people in remote communities on low incomes
are paying much more for food than urban living Australians
(Ferguson et al., 2015).
Furthermore, research suggests that a healthy diet is more
expensive. Diets considered healthy based on lean meat, fish,
and seafood; reduced fat dairy foods; whole grain cereals;
and fruit and vegetables are more costly in terms of the
amount of kilojoules provided per dollar compared with high
sugar and processed foods which are nutritionally poor but
cheaper in energy value (Andrieu, Darmon, & Drewnowski,
2005; Brimblecombe & O'Dea, 2009; Drewnowski &
Darmon, 2005). Brimblecombe, Ferguson, Liberato, O'Dea,
and Riley (2013) found that although diet could be improved
within current expenditure, it would still not meet Australian
dietary guidelines. The energy value of food appears impor-
tant particularly for families experiencing financial con-
straints (Andrieu et al., 2005; Brimblecombe & O'Dea,
2009).
Research into the price elasticity of food in Australia
found that some categories of food are inelastic (bread, fresh
vegetables, sugar, and jam) whereas for other categories,
demand is elastic (meat, rice, margarine, and preserved veg-
etables), and dairy products, fresh fruits, and some other
meat categories (ham, sausage, bacon) are estimated to have
unit elastic demand (Ulubasoglu, Mallick, Wadud, Hone, &
Haszler, 2010). It is likely that the elastic categories (where
people are sensitive to changes in price and stop or reduce
buying when price increases) compete with non-food items
such as electricity bills and other household items including
mobile phones. The mobile phone is a valued commodity
and usage continues to increase in remote Australia (Kral,
2012; A. Taylor, 2012).
In contrast to the concept of price elasticity/inelasticity, a
paper based on the experience of Arnhem Land Progress
Aboriginal Corporation (ALPA) states that "Aboriginal peo-
ple will pay almost anything for something they want; con-
versely if they do not want something it is impossible to
giveaway" (McMillan, 1991, p. 283). More recent research
observed an apparent increase in soft drink sales throughout
the Australian Government stimulus payment period
(Brimblecombe et al., 2010). This suggests that while price is
likely to be an influencing factor, people also need to value
the item they are buying. Healthy food may be less valued
for some of the reasons outlined in this article and when
goods in general cost more, there is less money available to
make healthy food choices.
Price subsidies are a tactic being touted as a means of
increasing consumption of healthier food. A systematic
review examining the effectiveness of price subsidies in pro-
moting healthy food purchase and/or consumption found
that, with one exception, subsidies increased purchase and/or
consumption (An, 2012). Subsidies were trialed on a large
scale in the Healthy Incentives Pilot which is a United
States­based project in which low-income households
enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(SNAP) received fruit and vegetable subsidies and found
that participants consumed almost 26% more fruit and veg-
etables than non-participants (Bartlett et al., 2014).
Along with independently owned stores, Outback Stores
and ALPA are the two main organizations providing manage-
ment assistance to retail stores in RIC in the Northern
Territory. Both these organizations have health and nutrition
policies in place which are aimed at increasing and facilitat-
ing intake of healthy food in RIC. In relation to price, ALPA
subsidizes 100% of freight costs on fresh fruit and vegetables
(ALPA, n.d.). Outback Stores are less prescriptive but state
that they "employ effective pricing strategies favoring the
affordability of healthy food lines" (Outback Stores, n.d.).
An evaluation of these strategies could help inform similar
policies for independently managed RIC stores.
Midstream Context
Midstream social marketing focuses on the impact of peo-
ple's more immediate environment on behavior such as
workplaces, schools, local communities, and service deliv-
ery organizations (Gordon, 2013). This can also include
friends, family, and influential others (N. Lee, Rothschild, &
Smith, 2011). Thus, social and cultural norms come into play
in a midstream approach.
Demand sharing.The distribution of goods and services in
RIC Indigenous communities takes many forms. Demand
sharing is one such form and relates to the "demanding"
rather than sharing of resources such as use of vehicles, alco-
hol, tobacco, and food (McDonnell & Martin, 2004). It is a
complex behavior (Peterson, 1993) and can occur in both
verbal and non-verbal forms and can be direct or indirect
(Altman, 2011). It is not our aim to discuss the various ways
in which demand sharing operates but rather to explain how
it can impact upon consumer decision-making and choice at
the POP.
The literature suggests that demand sharing can influence
choice at the POP in three ways: First, as a practice where
people purchasing food are obligated culturally through kin-
ship ties to buy or provide food for others when requested
(Smith & Daly, 1996). Saethre (2005) illustrates this with an
example of a woman purchasing extra food knowing others
(in addition to those in her household) would request a share.
Second, through avoiding such requests (or potential
"demands") by keeping food purchases to a minimum or by
buying takeout to ensure there is no "extra" food which can
be requested by others (Saethre, 2005, p. 7) or by being selec-
tive in the types of foods purchased to minimize cost in shar-
ing food. Finally, people may also choose times of the day to
shop when they believe fewer people will be demanding food
Henryks and Brimblecombe 5
and may therefore purchase and consume more expensive
items in these visits (Saethre, 2005). In each instance, the
concept of demand sharing influences what food is pur-
chased at the store level.
Indulging children.Similar to the rise of "pester power" in
non-Indigenous households throughout Australia (Dixon,
Scully, & Parkinson, 2006), children in RIC can have a sig-
nificant impact upon what is purchased at the store or super-
market. Children's demands for sweet food and drink are at
most times indulged and these demands become a driver of
food provisioning and consumption (Hamilton, 1981). Peter-
son (1993) discussed the upbringing of children as "highly
indulgent" (p. 863) compared with typical Anglo-Saxon
child-rearing practices. Similarly, Kruske, Belton, Ward-
aguga, and Narjic (2012) found that Indigenous beliefs
around children are markedly different to those of non-Indig-
enous. This includes the belief that "each child is an indepen-
dent, autonomous human being, capable of communicating
his or her needs from birth" (Kruske et al., 2012, p. 783). Not
surprisingly, this impacts upon parental choices in food deci-
sion making and provisioning.
A midstream approach could focus on modifying social
norms around healthy eating and in feeding children. Current
norms include indulging children such as meeting demands
for unhealthy food and drinks. Further research needs to be
undertaken to better understand these cultural norms and
how they specifically influence and impact upon healthier
eating practices. Other midstream approaches that are already
in practice include the policy work undertaken by some
Indigenous organizations to manage the supply of healthy
food in their communities (Butler et al., 2011). Having store
policies that ensure confectionery is not placed at eye level
of children or within easy reach could assist parents in cop-
ing with demands of children.
Food literacy.Consumer knowledge of what constitutes
healthy food is important if people are to consciously choose
food that is nutritionally sound. It has been recognized as a
priority in the recent National Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Health Plan (Commonwealth of Australia [CoA],
2013). Food literacy can be defined as follows:
A collection of inter-related knowledge, skills and behaviours
required to plan, manage, select, prepare and eat foods to meet
needs and determine food intake.
Food literacy is the scaffolding that empowers individuals,
households, communities or nations to protect diet quality
through change and support dietary resilience over time. (Vidgen
& Gallegos, 2012, p. 72)
As identified in the above definition, food literacy needs
to be considered at more than just an individual level: This
reinforces that environmental and individual behaviors are
interdependent. For instance, if a community store in a RIC
is stocked with a variety of highly prominent sugar-sweet-
ened breakfast cereals, individuals require knowledge and
skills about how to make healthier choices in what is referred
to as the "obesogenic environment" (Vidgen & Gallegos,
2012, p. 72).
Recent research into exploring ways of promoting and
supporting culturally appropriate healthier food choice in
one RIC suggests that community members prefer to gain
knowledge through practical means such as observing and
participating in food gathering and preparation in a social
context either in home, via family role models, or out of
homeincommunity-basedorganizations(Colles,Maypilama,
& Brimblecombe, 2014). This approach to food literacy
requires further research but is consistent with earlier com-
munity-directed programs (Rowley et al., 2000). The find-
ings of two recent studies suggest dietary benefits for
Aboriginal participants from "hands-on" programs that aim
to enhance food preparation and food literacy skills (Abbott,
Davison, Moore and Rubinstein, 2012; Nilson, Kearing-
Salmon, Morrison & Fetherston, 2015; Pettigrew, Jongenelis,
Moore & Pratt, 2015.
Indigenous people probably share a common knowledge
of healthy/unhealthy food as the general Australian popula-
tion, but perceive non-Indigenous people to have a much
greater knowledge of non-traditional food products and diet
equivalent to their in-depth understanding of traditional
foods (Brimblecombe et al., 2014).
Downstream Context
Finally, downstream social marketing focuses on the indi-
vidual and tends to place responsibility for change with the
consumer. As such, it's often been criticized for ignoring the
larger environmental issues and other social determinants of
health that are beyond the control of the individual (Donovan,
2011; Lefebvre, 2011). However, it is the category where
behavior occurs and such programs clearly have their place
in a holistic approach to the issue. It is also the arena where
most service providers engage. For example, public health
nutritionists providing nutrition services to communities not
only provide dietary counseling to patients referred to them
through health services but also often carry out cooking dem-
onstrations and other nutrition education and promotional
activities. Other examples in the non-government arena
include programs such as the Uncle Jimmy Thumbs Up!
operated by the Jimmy Little Foundation. This program uses
music, education, and store signage to promote healthier
food choices among young people in RIC.
The majority of consumer purchase decisions are made at
the POP. This includes any decisions made at the store
including at the shelf, end of aisle, and check out. Inman,
Winer, and Ferraro (2009) found that just under half of con-
sumer buying decisions are made at POP although this can
increase to 93% depending upon the context. Other market
6 SAGE Open
research has estimated this figure to be around 90% (Gander,
2005). Intuitively, this would suggest the POP to be an area
worth exploring in relation to consumers in RIC. In the con-
text of RIC, research has not identified a clear and cohesive
picture of drivers that influence decision making and choice
at the POP which could be used to enact social marketing
campaigns targeting behavioral change. The remainder of
this article explores and maps both store and individual POP
influencers of food choice.
POP Store-Level Factors Affecting Consumer
Buying Behavior
Packaging. Packaging can play a role in product choice at the
POP. McDonnell and Martin (2004, p. 17) identified the
impact a change of product packaging played in altering con-
sumer behavior:
During interviews a number of store managers detailed
experiences of products no longer selling because companies
changed their packaging.
These managers suggested that it was a failure by custom-
ers to recognize the new packaging as being the same prod-
uct. Other research supports this. For example, McMillan
(1991) argues that high brand loyalty to packaging is the
result of familiarity with packaging: "If tea comes in a blue
packet you don't buy it in a yellow one. The fact that one is
Bushells and one is Liptons is beside the point" (p. 283).
Since this study was undertaken (over two decades ago),
there is now increased television and media access in RIC
and people are likely to be exposed to brands via advertising
and other forms of communication not as easily available at
the time of the study. Either way, visual recognition and
familiarity is a driver in food purchase behavior: If consum-
ers are unable to recognize a product, they are less likely to
purchase it (Dahlen, Lange, & Smith, 2010, p. 90).
In-store cues. In-store stimuli (such as shelf talkers and post-
ers) have been noted to increase the degree of involvement
and consequently purchase, even with low involvement pur-
chases (Mitchell & Harris, 2005); however, a review of spe-
cific nutritional interventions on POP behavior found that
grocery store interventions were less successful than those in
workplaces and universities (Seymour et al., 2004) and POP
in-store nutritional information had mixed results (Glanz &
Yaroch, 2004). In addition, people tend to go to those sec-
tions of a retail outlet that they feel are relevant to their shop-
ping needs (Puccinelli et al., 2009). Other in-store cues
include physical product placement on shelves and end of
aisle gondolas and displays. Chandon, Hutchinson, Young,
and Bradlow (2009) used eye-tracking experiments and
found that although top- and middle-shelf positions gained
more attention than low-shelf positions, it was only products
located in top shelf positions that led to brand evaluation, a
precursor to purchase. Hence, it is important to ensure that
in-store behavior in RIC is understood so that signage and
POP cues are placed in high traffic areas and evaluated.
Arecent project by the Menzies School of Health Research
aimed at improving nutrition by developing a resource pack-
age for using shelf labels that highlight and promote healthier
food and drink choices in RIC found there were several nutri-
tional labeling programs used in RIC including Queensland
Health Green Label Program; Heart Foundation Tick and
Jimmy Little Thumbs Up! This research also tested commu-
nity developed labels in four pilot sites and found that the data
suggested that "shelf label projects could have the potential to
increase sales of labeled items within product groups where
there is a clear healthier option" such as breakfast cereals
(Menzies School of Health Research, 2013, p. 28).
In addition, the appearance of fresh fruit and vegetables
can influence purchase. The quality of fresh fruit and vegeta-
bles in RIC has been raised as an issue (Leonard, 2003).
Factors such as storage, transportation, and poor retail stock-
ing and presentation practices can result in fresh fruit and
vegetables appearing less than visually appealing.As appear-
ance is a key measure of quality in the fresh fruit and vegeta-
ble category, dried out, shriveled, or limp produce can deter
purchase (Grunert, 2002; J. Taylor & Westbury, 2000).
POP Influencers: Individual Factors Affecting
Purchase Decisions
Habit. Recent research suggests that most routine purchase
decisions are based on habit, constituting as much as 95% of
buying behavior (Martin & Morich, 2011). Habits make
choice at the POP easy as there is little conscious engage-
ment with the buying process: Consumers act on auto pilot
and choice is based on repeat purchase behavior. For exam-
ple, a study of one remote community in the Northern Terri-
tory, Lajamanu, found that despite the store stocking an
assortment of food, only a narrow range of food was pur-
chased. In particular, Saethre (2005) observed that only some
types of food stuffs were purchased despite there being wider
range of food available for purchase (p. 155).
A more recent study of food patterns in a remote commu-
nity found that there was a high intake of refined carbohy-
drates and a low intake of fruit and vegetables (Brimblecombe
& O'Dea, 2009), and a limited number of food types provid-
ing the majority of nutrients. The pattern was strong enough
to suggest habitual buying behavior. Some research suggests
that this food habit stems from the days of rationing where
white bread and sugar were staples (Saethre, 2011), and these
staples continue to form the basis of people's diets. This
habit results in a failure to purchase new potentially healthier
food unless consumers are encouraged to try these foods
through marketing or sales promotions. The concept of habit
plays an important role in food choice and is well recognized
by the food industry in their use of marketing strategies to alter
unfavorable brand buying behavior and encourage habitual
Henryks and Brimblecombe 7
behavior aimed at brand loyalty. However, as yet, it has not
been explored within the remote Indigenous context.
The role of habit (at the realm of the individual) has been
previously ignored in the RIC food context: possibly because
the focus is on finding things that are unique to the context
rather than seeking similarities or sameness with consumers
in the general Australian population. A rarely used theory
which may assist in understanding habit is the Theory of
Interpersonal Behavior (Bamberg & Schmidt, 2003; Triandis,
1977). This considers behavior to be a function of intention;
habit and situational constraints or facilitators. With the
exception of "intention," we have explored in this article the
impact of habit and situational factors on the impact of food
buying in RIC. Further research is required on habit as is
research into situational factors such as in-store cues--we
would suggest both are important in directing behavioral
change at the POP.
According to the theory of interpersonal behavior, inten-
tions are influenced by four factors including affect toward
the behavior (i.e., emotions attached to a behavior), cogni-
tive consequences of the behavior, social norms, and obliga-
tion to perform the behavior according to an individual's
values (Donovan & Henley, 2010, p. 137; Triandis, 1977).
Improving our understanding in this area will assist the
development of targeted social marketing strategies using
new technologies. For example, the increasing use of social
media in RIC suggests this is a tool that can be incorporated
into a social marketing strategy. One approach could be to
develop a mobile APP to assist people to make healthier food
choices at the POP allowing people to seek out the informa-
tion they needed, when they needed it (Henryks,
Brimblecombe, & Bidstrup, 2014).
Who buying for. The recipient of the food can influence what
is being purchased. A study in an urban Aboriginal commu-
nity found that providing filling meals to satiate hungry chil-
dren was a key concern of research participants (Adams
et al., 2012). This resulted in high energy foods, such as
white bread spread with margarine, being utilized to "fill up"
family members. In one remote community, people referred
to "lifelong foods" to be those most commonly purchased
(such as bread and sugar) as they filled one up, could be
shared, and easily stored (Brimblecombe et al., 2014).
Age.Older Indigenous people will often prefer familiar
foods including packaged and soft foods which could be
related to poor dental health (K. Schouten, personal commu-
nication, August 7, 20131). Other preferences relate to early
life experiences and current food supply and can include
high consumption of tinned corn beef, fatty meat including
lamb chops, sausages, and mince which is occasionally fla-
vored with packet soup mix, damper, tea, sugar, white bread,
and full cream milk powder (Kouris-Blazos & Wahlqvist,
2000; Wahlqvist, Kouris, Gracey, & Sullivan, 1991). This
also relates to habit as a POP driver.
In non-Indigenous communities, adolescents buying for
themselves are more likely to choose nutritionally poor food
as health and nutrition concerns are not strong drivers of
food choice (Story, Neumark-Sztainer, & French, 2002).
Anecdotal evidence suggests that children in remote com-
munities are given a lot of autonomy including their own
money to shop and thus younger people buying for them-
selves are often more likely to buy high sugar beverages in
preference to water. Similarly in broader Australia, younger
people consume more high sugar beverages (ABS).
Marketing and media influence.The impact of mainstream
advertising on remote community food choices is a topic that
requires further research, with a recent study (Brimblecombe
et al., 2014) citing this as a potential factor in the food choices
made by younger people in the community. Older people in
this community expressed concern for the influence they felt
advertising was having on young people's food choices.
Research from the early 1990s suggested that media cam-
paigns and the mobility of Aboriginal people influenced
demands for branded sugar-sweetened products just as in
non-Indigenous Australia (McMillan, 1991). A recent sys-
tematic review of food marketing to children found that
"food marketing influences children's food behavior and
diet-related health" (Cairns, Angus, Hastings, & Caraher,
2013, p. 214) and although not explored in the RIC context,
there is no evidence to suggest that children in RIC respond
differently to marketing as children in other contexts.
Income.A characteristic of food purchasing in low-income
and disadvantaged communities is the cycle of "feast and
famine" linked to the fortnightly income payment cycle
(Saethre, 2005). Food is purchased when the payment is
received and then as the fortnight progresses and money
dwindles, food items considered staples and cheaper are pur-
chased (which are often those with low nutritional value)
until the money runs out or money is obtained from others. In
the feast part of the cycle, a larger range of foods (including
fruit, vegetables, and meat) is purchased (Cutter, 1978, cited
in NHMRC, 2000). Food insecurity is experienced at a much
higher rate in the Indigenous population than the non-Indig-
enous. One in five Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peo-
ple live in a household where someone goes without food
when the household runs out compared with less than one in
20 non-Indigenous people (ABS, 2015).
Convenience and the practicality of cooking.Convenience in
relation to food in RIC does not only refer to the motivation
to save time (as it often does in consumer behavior literature)
but carries other implications such as issues around the prac-
ticality of storage and food preparation. It is not uncommon to
find houses without adequate cold food storage or working
cooking facilities (McDonnell & Martin, 2004; Saethre,
2005). A study of all houses found that 62% of houses were
not considered functional in relation to infrastructure required
8 SAGE Open
for the storage and preparation of food (Bailie & Runcie,
2001). This included basic components such as a kitchen
bench (missing in 26% of houses) stove top and oven (miss-
ing or not functional in 41% and 42% of homes respectively).
Furthermore, only 42% of houses were identified as having a
functioning refrigerator. Indicators suggest that not much has
improved. Health Habitat, working with Indigenous Austra-
lians, found that only 6% of 7,800 houses tested between
1999 and 2013 have the entire functioning infrastructure
required to being able to store, prepare, and cook food
(Health Habitat, 2013). The data are sourced from over 190
projects across Australia (and not just remote communities)
that have tested items in more than 7,500 houses and repre-
sents the living conditions of over 50,000 Australians.
Some forms of food preparation rely on access to stoves
or microwaves and potentially refrigeration to store ingredi-
ents or prepared food that is not immediately consumed.
Outdoor cooking is also an option; however, cooking on
open fires is complicated by the potential for demand shar-
ing. The process of cooking food outside may draw people
who can see the food and either directly or indirectly demand
a share (Saethre, 2011). In addition, cooking outside involves
additional effort and like non-Indigenous Australians, people
in RIC do not always have energy or time to collect wood
when they want to eat. However, it should be noted that these
are observations and, to our knowledge, have not been
explored from the perspective of Indigenous people.
The lack of basic cooking and storage equipment influ-
ences buying behavior at the POP as people are more likely
to purchase either prepared meals (e.g., takeout), food that
can be reheated in store (e.g., using store microwaves), or
food that requires minimal preparation (e.g., tinned meat and
bread). If healthier convenience type foods are not available,
the purchase and consumption of less healthy options cannot
be prevented. These behaviors are a way of getting around
having to cook and can also be viewed as a strategy to cir-
cumvent the lack of cooking facilities; however, it also
means that children of these households have limited expo-
sure to and opportunity to learn food preparation skills.
Implications and Further Research
POP drivers and influencers provide guidance for developing
a social marketing strategy to address the challenge of nutri-
tion in RIC. These factors individually or in tandem drive
decision making at the POP. The results of colonization
including the transition from a traditional food diet to a non-
traditional diet that is high in refined carbohydrates and
sodium and low in fiber and several micronutrients has
resulted in entrenched poor health issues and thus long-term
plans are critical: change will not happen in the short term.
However, with many stores now being owned by the com-
munity in which they operate, opportunities exist to research
effective POP strategies that would not only support but also
facilitate healthier eating in RIC.
The role of habit (the realm of the individual) has been
previously ignored in the RIC food context: possibly because
the focus is on finding things that are unique to the context
rather than seeking similarities or sameness with consumers
in the general Australian population. As previously stated,
further research is required on habit as is research into situ-
ational factors such as in-store cues--we would suggest
both are important in directing behavioral change at the
POP.
Conclusion
A significant health gap exists between Indigenous and non-
Indigenous people in Australia where Indigenous Australians
living in remote communities carry a significant and dispro-
portionate share of this gap. Inadequate or poor nutrition is
a key contributor to this health disparity and burden of dis-
ease for Indigenous Australians (Vos et al., 2007). The chal-
lenge of poor nutrition in RIC has been researched from a
variety of disciplines and perspectives. This article adds a
new perspective on the issue by discussing the extant litera-
ture through the lens of social marketing. Specifically, driv-
ers of food choice at the POP have been mapped and
although they have been drawn from existing literature, our
article suggests that in addition to upstream and midstream
approaches, habit and intention should be a key focus for
future research.
