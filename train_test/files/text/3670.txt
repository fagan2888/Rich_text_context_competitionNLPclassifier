This research studied the resilience of graduating university
students in a Philippine setting and how this construct is
determined by parental attachment and love language.
Luthar, Cicchetti, and Becker (2000) described resilience as
"a dynamic process encompassing positive adaptation within
the context of significant adversity" (p. 543). The two critical
conditions implicit in the quote are exposure to threat and
positive outcome. Resilience is the "process of, capacity for,
or outcome of successful adaptation despite challenging or
threatening circumstances" (Masten, Best, & Garmezy,
1991, p. 426). Three different situations may also be
observed: (a) individuals who have experienced traumatic
events but have been able to recover well; (b) persons who
belong to high-risk groups, but who have more favorable
outcomes than expected; and (c) persons who show positive
adaptation despite life stressors (Masten etal., 1991).
In a paper presented by Gilligan (2003), he describes
resilience not as a fixed trait but as a quality in children and
young people having a good sense of belonging, and self-
efficacy to confront adversities. These qualities would be
brought out in the context of committed and encouraging
relationships from others--parents, relatives, teachers, other
adults, and peers. In this discourse, Gilligan explored the
ways in which adults and professionals can act to nurture
resilience in young people. He contends the need to first,
value the capacities of children and young people; second,
recognize the naturally occurring supports and resources
found in the children's everyday lives; and third, to consider
a strengths perspective in practice, policy, and research
(Gilligan, 2003).
Positive parenting characterized by warmth, responsive-
ness, appropriate discipline, and secure attachment (Howell,
Graham-Bermann, Czyz, & Lilly, 2010; Stein, 2006) are key
protective factors in children growing up at risk. In homes
exposed to intimate partner violence, better maternal mental
health is a component to more positive outcomes. Mothers
with fewer depressive and traumatic symptoms are more able
to maintain positive and warm child attachment and interac-
tions, which can support the mastery of developmental tasks
such as emotion regulation and pro-social skills (Howell
etal., 2010). Twin studies on the impact of maternal warmth
reveal that the twin who received the most maternal warmth
had fewer behavioral problems as concordant for bullying
victimization(Bowes,Maughan,Caspi,Moffitt,&Arseneault,
2010) and have positive adjustment despite socio-economic

Parental Attachment and Love Language
as Determinants of Resilience Among
Graduating University Students
Sally I. Maximo1,2 and Jennifer S. Carranza1
Abstract
The influence of parental attachment and love language on the resilience of graduating university students was studied in a
Philippine setting. Using the survey method (N = 843), it was found that a secure attachment and receiving love from parents
result in higher resilience. The parental love languages quality time, words of affirmation, and acts of service significantly
contributed to resilience. These are love languages that provide emotional, motivational, and practical resources that build
resilience. While quality time contributed the most to resilience, a secure attachment is most especially required of fathers
whereas words of affirmation and physical touch are needed from mothers. Sons need quality time from their fathers and the
physical touch of their mothers. Daughters benefit from quality time with mothers alongside a secure attachment and words
of affirmation from their fathers. This study emphasizes the parental factors of attachment and love as external resources
of resilience. The research highlights the quality of parent­child relationship experience that would support the resilience of
young adults. Results also point to the advantage of having loving parents and a secure parental attachment.

deprivation as a risk factor (Kim-Cohen, Moffitt, Caspi, &
Taylor, 2004). Apart from parental behavior, broader family
functioning such as the children's perception of family
coherence and stability are associated with positive adapta-
tion among maltreated children (Haskett, Near, Ward, &
McPherson, 2006).
Parental Attachment and Resilience
Bowlby (1979) conceptualized attachment as
the propensity of human beings to make strong affectional bonds
to particular others and of explaining the many forms of
emotional distress and personality disturbance, including
anxiety, anger, depression, and emotional detachment, to which
unwilling separation and loss give rise. (p. 127)
The behavior of attaining and maintaining proximity to an
attachment figure, usually conceived as stronger and/or
wiser, "characterize human beings from cradle to the grave"
(Bowlby, 1979, p. 129). Such is prevalent during early child-
hood; however, it becomes apparent in adulthood when a
person is distressed, ill, or afraid.
The need to balance attachment and exploratory behav-
iors was emphasized in the writings of Bowlby (1979) and
Ainsworth and Bell (1970). There are genetic biases that bal-
ance this need to attach with the need to separate from moth-
ers. The latter would promote exploration and acquisition of
knowledge, which will help species to adapt to their physical
and social environment (Ainsworth & Bell, 1970). When
children are provided with conditions of this balance, Bowlby
asserted that they grow up secure and self-reliant and, in rela-
tion to others, they tend to be more trusting, cooperative, and
helpful. Sensitive parenting is a key ingredient to developing
a secure internal working model. Pathogenic parenting is
common in psychiatric referrals of anxious and insecure
individuals.
The influence of parental warmth and mental condition
on the outcome of adolescent and adult children has been
explored by some contemporary studies. McKinney and
Milone (2012) found that parental psychopathology and
parenting are related to late adolescent psychopathology.
Perceived positive parenting increased the likelihood of late
adolescent psychopathology in the context of high perceived
parental psychopathology. The authors posit that children
tend to identify more strongly with parents who provide
positive parenting; hence, this higher level of identification
and involvement may lead to a stronger transmission of
parental psychopathology. In a study among Chinese ado-
lescents for instance, pressure from parents to perform well
in school may have negative effects on their psychological
functioning. However, it was also found that greater paren-
tal warmth generally reduced the association between the
parents' academic pressure and the adolescents' symptoms
of depression and anxiety (Quach, Epstein, Riley, Falconier,
& Fang, 2015). Results of a qualitative meta-synthesis of
studies among adult children having parents with mental ill-
ness revealed that the central theme revolved around rela-
tionship issues with reference to a lack of emotional affect,
distorted perceptions of others, hyper vigilance of others'
emotional states, and mistrust of others (Murphy, Peters,
Jackson, & Wilkes, 2011). These findings may reinforce
Bowlby's attachment theory. However, the results of the
meta-synthesis also highlighted that experiences of parental
mental illness have also generated creativity, resilience, and
personal growth, which questions the automatic correlation
of parental mental illness and trauma.
Atwool (2006) saw the significance of combining resil-
ience and attachment theories such that it signifies relation-
ships as key to all aspects of resilience--culture, community,
relationships, and individual factors. Both theories facilitate
the understanding of the adaptive nature of behavior and the
types of relationship experiences necessary to promote posi-
tive adaptation.
Parental relations have been studied to be important in
encouraging resilience. In a study among youths ages 9 to
15, it supported that parental responsiveness improved the
prediction of the children's emotional resilience. Both
mother and father parenting behaviors were seen as making
unique contributions to the emotional functioning of children
(Boughton & Lumley, 2011). A difference between mothers
and fathers was also established in a longitudinal study con-
sidering first-born children living in traditional mother-
father-child homes (Steele & Steele, 2005). The researchers'
data suggested that when understanding and resolving emo-
tional conflicts within themselves, these children were highly
influenced by their relationship with their mothers. However,
their relationship with their fathers will more likely influence
their understanding and resolution of emotional conflicts in
the outer world of human interaction--for example, with sib-
lings and peers.
Throughout adolescence, reliance on parents decreases,
but this does not necessarily mean that the attachment rela-
tionship diminishes.Around this time, attachment may extend
from parents to peers, with peers often becoming the pre-
ferred persons to spend time with and receive comfort from
(Noller, Feeney, & Peterson, 2001). One view of this change
of relationships is that peer groups and friendships provide
important "way stations" during the separation process from
parents (Goossens & Marcoen, 1999). However, parents still
perform a critical function as secure base from which to
explore peer relationships and different roles and identities.
The secure base allows a child to explore this external world
and return safely if the need arises (Noller etal., 2001).
Resilience and Love Language of
Parents
Several studies demonstrate that the primary factor in resil-
ience is having caring and supportive relationships within
Maximo and Carranza 3
and outside the family. Relationships that create love and
trust provide role models, and offer encouragement and reas-
surance that help bolster a person's resilience. Other
researches take warmth and responsiveness to be a good
indicator of love and have investigated the long-term effects
of warm and responsive parenting on children (Maccoby,
1980). Hill, Stafford, Seaman, Ross, and Daniel (2007)
reviewed several works showing that warm and responsive
parenting develops intrinsic resilient capacities and mediates
coping responses to many adversities including poverty, ill
heath, substance abuse, youth crime, bereavement, or com-
munity violence.
Many adolescents identify the value and importance of
maintaining positive, respectful, and loving relationships
with parents, a closeness that can override the effects of
poor peer relationships (Noller & Patton, 1990). A sense of
belonging and connectedness to family, and feeling loved
and respected in the family, is a protective factor for a num-
ber of risk behaviors, including suicidal behaviors, sub-
stance abuse, and violence (Fuller, McGraw, & Goodyear,
1999). Caring and connectedness surpass a range of demo-
graphic characteristics, such as single versus two parent
families, as protective factors against risky behaviors
(Rayner & Montague, 2000).
Chapman and Campbell (1997) described love lan-
guages into specific behavioral expressions, namely, physi-
cal touch, quality time, gifts, acts of service, and words of
affirmation. Children are behaviorally motivated and they
respond better when parents convey love concretely through
these actions. Chapman and Campbell (1997) said that
"every child has an emotional tank, a place of emotional
strength that can fuel him through the challenging days of
childhood and adolescence" (p. 17). Parents must fill their
children's emotional tanks with unconditional love for
them to operate as they should and reach their potential.
This research operationalized love based on Chapman and
Campbell's concept of love languages.
Gender Differences: Resilience and
Parenting
Protective factors may differ across gender. For instance,
girls tend to become resilient by building strong, caring rela-
tionships, whereas boys are more likely to build resilience by
learning how to use active problem solving (Bernard, 1995).
Further evidence that resilience may yield gender differences
comes from the research of Werner and Smith (1992). In
their longitudinal study of high-risk children, it was found
that scholastic competence at age 10 was more strongly asso-
ciated with successful transition to adult responsibilities for
men than women. However, factors such as high self-esteem,
efficacy, and a sense of personal control were more predic-
tive of successful adaptation among women than men. In the
stress domain, males were more vulnerable to separation and
loss of caregivers in the first decade of life, while girls are
more vulnerable to family discord and loss in the second
decade. Thus, the factors that influence resilience may differ
in males and females.
Overholt and Ewert (2015) found that males and
females gained resilience by participating in the outdoor
adventure program. Both and males and females cited
stressful events, uncertainty, physical difficulty, and peer
relationships as contributors to resilience development.
These experiences were reported as contributing to self-
confidence and self-reliance. While women were espe-
cially concerned with the physical challenges of the
expedition, men emphasized relational difficulties. Males
decreased in reported levels of resilience, whereas females
experienced increased levels. Many of the men entered
the program with a high level of confidence and later find-
ing humility as they learned to cope with the challenges.
Expeditions are often framed in terms of their physical
challenges without much emphasis on the other challeng-
ing aspects such as interpersonal relationships. This dif-
ference in evaluation and expectation may be an artifact of
the ways in which individuals are socialized in terms of
gender and gender identity.
With regard to parenting, Doucet (2009) argued that
despite ideologies and norms changing over time, beneath
the surfaces of everyday practices, there is still a constant
pull back to those primary assumptions about women as
primary carers and men as secondary caregivers. In her
study on fathers, there is a strong sense that women feel
guilty about leaving their child to go back to work and
men feel guilty about leaving their work to care for their
child. Mothers feel pulled toward care and connection
while fathers feel pulled toward paid work and
autonomy.
However, using a maternal lens in understanding fathers
means that paternal forms of nurturing are ignored or
obscured. For example, with regard to the issue of emotional
responsibility, a maternal lens misses the ways in which
fathers promote children's independence, playfulness, and
physicality, and these outdoors approach to the care of
young children are viewed only as second best, or invisible,
ways of caring. One of Doucet's conclusions in parenting is
that, rather than using a maternal lens and comparing fathers
with mothers, what is required are novel ways of listening
to, and theorizing about fathers' approaches to parental
responsibilities.
Some previous studies exist exploring the differences in
paternal and maternal influences on affective measures
(Barton & Kirtley, 2012) and problem behaviors (Malmberg
& Flouri, 2011) among sons and daughters as well as core
beliefs in young women (Blissett etal., 2006). In this study,
we would also present paternal and maternal influences on
the resilience of sons and daughters. Specifically, this study
could determine which attachment styles and love language
of fathers and mothers are best predictive of the resilience of
their sons and daughters.

Cultural Issues
The resilience among the Filipinos may relate to having a
more interdependent self-construal (Peña-Alampay, 2003).
The Filipino self is perceived as connected with others from
a deep sense of kapwa or referring to the oneness of the self
with others. In a study among Filipino adolescents, Rufino
Ramos (2007) found that the implicit meaning of happiness
is consistent with a collectivist perspective. Happiness is
contextualized in meaningful interpersonal relationships
with emphasis on friendship and family support. Kapwa
and the collectivist culture seep through many of the
Filipinos' values and patterns of feelings, thoughts, and
actions. The understanding of Filipino resilience may also
then be understood in line with interdependence, kapwa,
and a collectivist mind-set.
This research was conducted among graduating students
of a university in the northern part of the Philippines. This
study first explored the general influence of parental attach-
ment and love language on the resilience of these students.
The specific paternal and maternal influences were also dealt
with. Differences between the parental influences on the
resilience of sons and daughters were likewise specifically
tackled. The researchers hypothesized that a secure attach-
ment would relate positively to resilience compared with
insecure attachment. Generally, the love languages were
hypothesized to relate positively to resilience as well. This
study also explored which of these combined parental factors
would best predict the resilience of the students as a whole
and also that of the high stress group.
Method
Research Design
The descriptive method was used as this research aims to
provide information about how resilience varies in relation
to parent­child attachment and parental love languages. The
survey is the main tool employed. The researchers used
quantitative measures to gather and analyze data.
Correlational methods and tests of differences were used to
analyze the quantitative relations of the variables parental
attachment and love languages with resilience. Cross-
sectional design was used to compare existing differences
among the target groups.
Population and Locale of the Study
For the survey questionnaires, 843 valid respondents were
included in the statistical analysis. These are graduating uni-
versity students of Saint Louis University, Baguio City,
Philippines. Their mean age is 19.97 (SD = 1.026) and to be
valid to answer the questionnaire, these students must be
Filipinos and not exceeding 23 years old. There were more
females (67%) than males (37%). The university caters
mostly to students coming from middle-income families.
College life is challenging especially for students who have
to hurdle the demands and requirements of graduation. They
also have to deal with the complexities of their lives outside
the academe. Several of these students may be juggling work
and studies while some are young parents caring for their
children. In addition, they have to fulfill their other interper-
sonal roles in relation to their parents, romantic partners, sib-
lings, and friends.
Data Gathering Tools and Procedures
Upon administrative and ethics approval of this study, the
researchers distributed the questionnaires through the fac-
ulty or supervisors of graduating university students from
different undergraduate courses. The students were pro-
vided informed consent through a letter attached to the
questionnaires.
Questionnaire.The entire questionnaire is self-administered
and may be completed within 20 to 30 min. The graduating
students answered the questionnaires the week immediately
after the mid-term examinations, hence, adding to the stress
component essential in resilience studies. The main mea-
sures used with their descriptions are as follows:
The College Life Stress Inventory (Renner & Mackin,
1998). This consists of a list of 101 stressful events that the
students may have encountered within the last 12 months.
Each event has a corresponding stress rating and the sum
of these ratings is computed to derive the stress rating per
respondent. Some items were slightly modified to make them
more content valid based on the culture. For example, attend-
ing an athletic or social event (e.g., games, parties; note that
social events/parties were not included in the original).
The Relationship Questionnaire.These are four statements
each describing the attachment patterns to a specific relation.
The attachment categories are based on the four-factor model
of Bartholomew and Horowitz (1991). Half of the question-
naires distributed would measure attachment to their fathers
while the rest would measure attachment to their mothers as
secure, pre-occupied, dismissing, or fearful. A 6-point rating
scale is used with the following ratings and respective qualita-
tive meanings: 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = some-
what disagree, 4 = somewhat agree, 5 = agree, and 6 = strongly
agree. This same 6-point scale was used for the Parental Love
Language Scale and the Resilience Measures.
Parental Love Language Scale. This is a 15-item measure of
the five-categories of love languages, which are (a) words of
affirmation, (b) quality time, (c) gifts, (d) acts of service, and
(e) physical touch. Based on the descriptions of Chapman
and Campbell (1997), the researchers made three behav-
ioral items to represent each of the love language categories.
For the reliability of the measure given the sample of this
Maximo and Carranza 5
research, Cronbach's alpha coefficients were derived as fol-
lows: (a) Full Scale (n = 15),  = .93; (b) words of affirma-
tion (n = 3),  = .85; (c) quality time (n = 3),  = .81; (d) gifts
(n = 3),  = .81; (e) acts of service (n = 3),  = .73; and (f)
physical touch (n = 3),  = .86.
The Child and Youth Resilience Measure­28 (CYRM-28,
2009).The CYRM-28 (2009) is a 28-item tool designed
as part of the International Resilience Project (IRP), of the
Resilience Research Centre in Nova Scotia, Canada. It is a
screening tool for resilience among the youths aged 12 to
23 years and it adopts an ecological model where individ-
ual, relational, communal, and cultural resources could be
explored. The computed reliability coefficients using the
entire sample are as follows: (a) Full Scale (n =28),  = .91;
(b) individual resilience factors (RF; n = 8),  = .70; (c) rela-
tionship RF (n = 6),  = .70; (d) community RF (n = 8),  =
.76; and (e) cultural RF (n = 6),  = .75.
Short Resilience Scale­7 (SRS-7). This is a seven-item test
of resilience that the researchers developed based on the
definition of resilience. The items pertain to a combination
of behaviors that can help persons overcome difficulties
or confront stresses in more effective ways. The computed
reliability coefficient is  = .82 (n = 7). Compared with the
CYRM-28, which mostly describes external resources, this
measure pertains more to qualities found within the person.
For this research, resilience was measured by combining
the items in the CYRM-28 and SRS-7.
Results
The influence of parental determinants on resilience was
explored through test of differences via ANOVA, t tests,
Pearson product­moment correlation coefficients, and hier-
archical multiple regression analysis. Test of differences are
first presented followed by the correlational methods.
Test of Differences
Differences in attachment styles.The dominant attachment
style of the respondents was identified based on the item
rated highest in the Relationship Questionnaire. Only those
with one highest rating on the four items were categorized. A
total of 564 respondents (66.90% of 843; Secure n = 367,
Dismissing n = 100, Pre-occupied n = 77; Fearful n = 20)
were categorized. One-way ANOVA was computed. The
obtained F(3, 561) = 17.478, p < .001, is significant with
attachment having a moderate effect (2 = .085) on resil-
ience. The Tukey method shows that those with secure
attachment have higher resilience level than those with fear-
ful and dismissing attachment.
Differences in level of love received.Two contrasting groups
were derived based on the scores in the love language full
scale. The resilience level of the upper 27% (those who were
loved more; n = 207) and the lower 27% (those who were
loved less; n = 235) were compared via t tests for indepen-
dent samples. The obtained t(440) = -14.913, p < .001, is
significant with very large effect (2 = 0.336). Those who
have received more love from their parents have signifi-
cantly higher resilience (M = 5.1724; SD = .39857) com-
pared with those who have received less love (M = 4.4734;
SD = .57969).
Correlational Method
Secure attachment has a significant positive relationship
with resilience, whereas fearful and dismissing attachments
(both avoidant) have a significant negative relationship with
resilience. Pre-occupied attachment is not significantly
related to resilience. The full scale love language and its cat-
egories are positively related to resilience.
Hierarchical Multiple Regression Analysis
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were computed by
first entering attachment measures followed by love lan-
guages measures as predictors of resilience. Pre-occupied
attachment has insignificant Pearson correlations with resil-
ience and therefore was not entered into the regression.
Resilience Among Young Adults
Attachment Styles significantly contribute to the variability
of resilience in all conditions in Model 1 (Table 2) with all F
values significant. When combined with Love Languages
(Model 2 in Table 2), the variances accounted for by the
parental determinants on resilience significantly increase as
observed by the higher values of Determination Coefficients

(R2) in Model 2 compared with Model 1. Moreover, the
added contributions of Love Languages (R2 Change, Model
2), over and above what is contributed by Attachment, are
still substantial with all F Change in Model 2 significant.
Given the beta coefficients in Table 3, the substantial
parental predictors of resilience (betas italicized and in
parentheses) are identified for the general group and for the
target subgroupings.
Resilience among the young adults in general. Results show that
quality time, words of affirmation, and acts of service from
both parents are more substantially associated with the resil-
ience of the general group. While quality time and a secure
attachment from fathers associate more to resilience, the
mothers' quality time, words of affirmation, and physical
touch substantially relate to the young adults' resilience.
Resilience among the high stress group. The high stress group
consists of the upper 27% scorers in the College Life Stress
Inventory (Renner & Mackin, 1998). Quality time from both
parents, and even separately, either from fathers or mothers,
made a significant contribution to the variation in the resil-
ience of the high stress group. To a certain extent, resilience
is also associated with paternal attachment that is more
secure ( = .246) and less dismissing ( = -.183).
Resilience among sons. The resilience of sons is substantially
accounted for by the love languages quality time and physi-
cal touch from both parents. Specifically, quality time from
fathers and physical touch from mothers made a higher con-
tribution to the resilience of sons.
Resilience among daughters. Quality time and words of affir-
mation from both parents made a significant contribution to
the variation in the resilience of daughters. Resilience is
more associated with quality time from both fathers and
mothers. In addition, a secure paternal attachment and words
of affirmation from their fathers also link to the daughters'
resilience.
Discussion
The findings confirm the hypotheses that resilience is posi-
tively linked to secure attachment and negatively linked to
insecure attachment. Lower resilience is expected of inse-
cure attachment specifically for the avoidant types--fearful
and dismissing. Resilience seems to entail approach behav-
iors that individuals with avoidant attachment would less
likely do. Secure persons tend to be more trusting, coopera-
tive, and helpful with reference to others. They would more
likely seek help having an internal working model that the
others--parents, relatives, teachers, other adults, and peers--
are dependable.This coincides with Benzies and Mychasiuk's
(2009) idea of optimizing resilience, that is, secure individu-
als as opposed to avoidant ones are more likely to strengthen
their protective factors at all interactive levels of the socio-
ecological model.
The findings likewise support that resilience is positively
linked to Parental Love Language. Those who received more
love from their parents are more resilient. Chapman and
Campbell (1997) described the concept of emotional tank in
people, which gets filled when loved by others. When the
emotional tank of people is not empty, they can draw out inner
strength, which is most especially needed in times of stress.
Parental Determinants of Resilience
The three love languages combined, namely, quality time,
words of affirmation, and acts of service, contribute signifi-
cantly to resilience. Quality time is expressed when parents
show genuine interest through attention, listening, understand-
ing feelings, and doing things together with children. Quality
time encourages communication and active listening. This
corroborates Zabriskiel and McCormick's (2001) observation
that spending time together and enjoying fun activities is asso-
ciated with kids and parents having a stronger emotional bond.
The emotional recharging provided in quality time enhances
resilience. Resilience is likewise linked to receiving words

of affirmation from parents that reflect kindness, accep-
tance, encouragement, and appreciation. Words of encour-
agement helps promote and restore a person's self-esteem.
This finding is reinforced by Jennifer Kolari's (2009)
descriptions of the long-term impact of words on brain and
neurological pathways. Repeated exposure to yelling fuels
fear and anxiety, and a poor self-image that conditions chil-
dren to anticipate poor, unsupportive responses and nega-
tive experiences from the world, whereas positive verbal
messages, empathy, and the feeling of being heard tend to
nurture the self, create positive expectations, and lay the
foundation of resilience.
Acts of service entails receiving practical help like finish-
ing house chores, providing needs and wants, as well as
being assisted in projects and homework. Resilience in
young adults is higher when they recall their parents render-
ing them needed service like cooking, fixing stuff, and
driving among others. Acts of service help build cooperation,
trust, and a sense of safety. It promotes resilience as by
receiving help, people may develop a more positive schema,
that is, life is not after all difficult, that problems have solu-
tions, and that others are available for support. In sum, paren-
tal love expressed through (a) quality time, (b) words of
affirmation, and (c) acts of service, respectively, provide the
emotional, motivational, and practical resources needed to
build resilience in young adults.
Paternal and Maternal Influences
Generally, quality time from both parents contributes largely
to the resilience of these young adults. In addition, a secure
attachment to fathers and the mothers' expression of love
specifically through words of affirmation and physical touch
play a role in resilience as well.

The role of a secure paternal attachment on resilience of
young adults may relate to the finding of Rosenberg and
Wilcox (2006) who contend that the outcome in children is
reflected in greater confidence to explore surroundings and
better social connections with peers. The interaction of
fathers to their children tends to promote independence and
an orientation to the outside world. As a guide to the outside
world, children are influenced to explore the world comfort-
ably and to exhibit self-control and pro-social behavior. This
corroborates Steele and Steele's (2005) research data sug-
gesting that children's relationship with their fathers will
more likely influence their understanding and resolution of
emotional conflicts in the outer world of human interac-
tion--for example, with siblings and peers. Many RFs are
elements of the external world. Hence, when children have a
secure attachment to their fathers, they are more able to navi-
gate their external world and effectively tap on these RFs.
This study also shows that mothers who express love
through physical touch and words of affirmation contribute
to the resilience of young adults. Words of affirmation that
include encouragement and praises, especially from mothers,
can increase self-esteem. Increasing self-esteem enhances
feelings of competencies in basic life and problem-solving
skills thereby promoting resilience. Mothers who have also
provided affection through touch (hugs, kisses, embrace)
contributed to the young adults' resilience. Future research
may try to delve more on this connection although the find-
ings seem to correspond with previous studies on touch and
its influence on the survival and development of children
such as the premature infants placed naked between their
mother's breasts for extended periods of time (Feldman,
Weller, Sirota, & Eidelman, 2003). Follow-up studies reveal
that by 10 years of age, these children also showed attenu-
ated stress response, improved autonomic functioning, orga-
nized sleep, and better cognitive control (Feldman, Rosenthal,
& Eidelman, 2014). Another connected study is on how mas-
sage therapy was shown to increase the weight of pre-term
babies (Field, 2001) and to decrease the stress hormone cor-
tisol and increase one's immune function (Field, 1998). It has
proven to alleviate stress related to job, aging, and pregnancy
(Field, Hernandez-Reif, Diego, Schanberg, & Kuhn, 2005).
Field (2002) also observed that intervention using massage
therapy decreased aggressive behavior and increased empa-
thetic behavior among violent adolescents. From these cor-
roborative studies, it may be implied that when young adults
receive loving physical touch, most specially from their
mothers, it is related to a more effective structure in the brain
and the body that allows them to behave more effectively.
These behavioral and cognitive controls are essential in
building resilience.
High Stress Group
Quality time is a strong predictor of the resilience among the
high stress group. Stress can cause emotional exhaustion;
hence, stressed people need a nurturing companion to restore
emotional strength. Having someone who encourages com-
munication helps stressed people process the distressing
emotions that accompany stress. Clear and open communica-
tion allows them to share their reactions, accept emotions,
and link them to outside sources of support.
It can be observed that a secure paternal attachment, and
not a dismissing one, predicts the resilience of the high stress
group. Earlier it was mentioned that fathers orient children to
the external world, an outdoors approach as termed by
Doucet (2009). A secure connection with fathers facilitates
the development of an internal working model that the exter-
nal world is trustworthy. Securely attached individuals are
more comfortable exploring their environment allowing
them to find the resources they need to handle their stresses.
Resilience Among Sons and Daughters
Sons need quality time from their fathers. By spending qual-
ity time with their sons, fathers are able to model and teach
behaviors necessary for living. Therapist, educator, and
author Michael Gurian (1998) discussed the role of the mas-
culine nurturing system in the development of adolescent
boys who seek the challenge and kindness of environments
full of male energy to inculcate discipline, morality teaching,
and emotional sustenance. By reviewing studies on the role
of fathers, it was noted that they spend more stimulating and
playful activities with their children (Doucet, 2009;
Rosenberg & Wilcox, 2006). Children learn to regulate their
feelings and behavior in these interactions. Roughhousing,
often engaged in by boys with their fathers, can teach chil-
dren to deal with aggressive impulses and physical contact
without losing control of their emotions. The skills and
behavioral control processes learned by sons from their
fathers could enhance their resilience.
Sons also need physical touch from their mothers as this
predicts their resilience. Gurian (1998) described the emerg-
ing brain of an adolescent male during the second decade.
Being more spatial than females and with increasing testos-
terone levels, boys tend toward activities that verge on vio-
lence, physical activity, physical gesturing, and physical play.
Males will then be more likely to be physical having fewer
verbal tools than females in response to intense emotive reac-
tions like anger. Given the advantage of physical touch on
stabilizing physiological responses, it can be implied that
young adult males who have received more maternal physical
touch will tend to be more resilient, able to regulate their
aggressive impulses, and capable of behavioral control.
Sons need quality time from their fathers, and daughters
need quality time from their mothers. Gender socialization
occurs when children experience different child care behav-
iors from their mothers and fathers. Reviewed Filipino stud-
ies (Liwag, Dela Cruz, & Macapagal, 2002) show that
although many Filipinos share the belief that child-rearing
practice is a joint parental responsibility, in reality, the mother
Maximo and Carranza 9
is still ranked as the primary caretaker of her children. It was
also reported that during childhood years, girls naturally
become closer to their mothers while boys become closer to
their fathers. In the normal course of gender identity forma-
tion, daughters and sons identify with their same-sexed par-
ent. Parents then become powerful models of masculine and
feminine behaviors for their children. Daughters could learn
best to solve problems encountered by women through their
relationship with their mothers. From their fathers, daughters
need to feel secure and receive words of acceptance, appre-
ciation, and encouragement from them. This supports find-
ings that positive father­daughter relationships have shown
benefits in the areas of career success, relations with other
men, trust, joy, and self-confidence (Nielsen, 2007).
Conclusion
Parental factors are one of the external resources of resil-
ience. The study indicates that approach behaviors, charac-
terized by secure attachment, make one more resilient as
opposed to avoidant behaviors. Results also imply that lov-
ing parents raise resilient children. Three love languages,
namely, quality time, words of affirmation, and acts of ser-
vice, contribute most to resilience. To love effectively, par-
ents need to, first, be a presence in the lives of their children,
that is, to become a source of emotional support. Second,
parents need to be an affirmer of their children's strengths
and, third, to be a loving steward by providing the practical
needs of their children. Quality time, words of affirmation,
and acts of service are love languages that provide emo-
tional, motivational, and practical resources, respectively.
When children are loved well by their parents, their emo-
tional tank gets filled and they get primed, bodily and psy-
chologically, to face the challenges of life.
This study also provides insight on paternal and maternal
influences most contributing of the young adults' resilience.
Quality time from both parents is a basic love language that
contributes most to resilience, especially when high stress is
encountered. A secure attachment to fathers is an advantage
as they have the role of orienting their children to the exter-
nal world. When securely attached to fathers, children are
more likely to view their external environment as a relatively
safe and comfortable place to explore. The mother's nurtur-
ing role, through affirming words and physical affection,
contribute to resilience as this may help build self-esteem.
Moreover, the loving touch of mothers helps the body to
respond with lesser anxiety and greater calm. Maternal love
appears to enhance the children's physical and psychological
readiness to confront the demands of the external world. This
research provided evidence that parental love is a protective
factor that allows children to build resilience and its effect
continues even until young adulthood.
Fathers and mothers have essential roles in developing
resilience in their children. Both sons and daughters need
quality time most especially from their parents of the same
sex. Apart from emotional support, quality time allows for
the social learning of skills that father­sons and mother­
daughters relationship could provide. In sum, this study sup-
ports the hypothesis that secure attachment and greater
parental love result to higher resilience in young adults.
Several recommendations could be made from this study's
findings. First, young adults are encouraged to continue their
bonds with their parents and family and to increase their aware-
ness of available support systems that help build their resil-
ience. Parents are urged to spend quality time with their
children, to affirm their worth, and continue providing practical
help. Related community institutions (schools, churches, men-
tal health agencies, government sector, etc.) could foster resil-
ience building programs among its constituents through
relevant activities such as curriculum development in schools,
seminar/workshop offerings, and the establishment or strength-
ening of supportive agencies.
Future research may explore how far parent­child attach-
ment and parental love languages can predict or influence
resilience throughout adulthood. Although this study proved
that the variables parental attachment and love are predictive
of resilience, other explanatory research designs are called
for to validate a cause and effect relationship. This study
included a very limited age range and setting for its respon-
dents. Different findings may result granting a more diverse
age group and population.
