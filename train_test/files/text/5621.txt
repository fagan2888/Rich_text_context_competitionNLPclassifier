Policymakers seeking to enhance educational outcomes have
adopted numerous choice policies designed to increase com-
petition in public education. Market-based theories of school
choice favoring competition in education argue that increased
parental choice will enhance the efficiency of not only choice
schools but also nonchoice schools by stimulating improve-
ment in the entire system (Chubb & Moe, 1990; Hoxby,
2000). Critics of choice policies, however, are concerned
about the unintended consequences of adopting market-
based policies in education. One persistent concern is the
potential increase in racial and socioeconomic segregation in
public schools (Frankenberg, Siegel-Hawley, & Wang, 2011;
Henig, 1994; Levin, 1998; Lubienski, 2005; Smith & Meier,
1995). Charter schools have had strong bipartisan support for
more than 15 years now from both sides of the aisle in
Congress. Race to the Top program that began in 2009
requires states to prepare plans that are in line with the edu-
cation-reform criteria, which include the growth of charter
schools. As we move into the new phase of charter school
growth, it is important to keep tracking the improvements
and changes in nonchoice schools, as well as choice schools,
and whether and the degree to which the improvements are
accompanied by stratification along race or socioeconomic
status.
Most states have adopted charter school legislation and
support the school founders to increase the quality and effi-
ciency of schooling not only in the charter schools them-
selves but also in the entire public education system. Many
educational reformers find competition indispensable for
public schools improvement (Lubienski, 2006). An early
report by U.S. Department of Education showed that the
charter school authorizers interviewed cited creating compe-
tition in the public school system as the primary reason they
awarded charters (Policy and Program Studies Services
[PPSS], 2004). Those who support charters see these alterna-
tive schools as a promising policy option to lift urban educa-
tion. Scholars have argued that charter schools might reduce
existing stratification, particularly in locations where tradi-
tional public schools are highly segregated, by either reduc-
ing middle-class parents' willingness to move to the suburbs
or to send their children to private schools or by empowering
disadvantaged parents to choose schools without residential
limitations (Greene, 2000; Hassel, 1999). Overall, the move-
ment has been enjoying wide support from politicians from
both sides of the partisan line, a large group of educators, and
parents, and consequently the number of charter schools has
grown rapidly. An ever-increasing number of studies on vari-
ous aspects of charter schools are published. In addition to
their effect on their own students' achievement, studies

Charter Schools and Student
Compositions of Traditional Public
Schools
Nevbahar Ertas1
Abstract
One of the most contentious urban education policy issues in the United States today is the expansion of charter schools
and its repercussions. Does the expansion of charter schools affect the racial and socioeconomic composition of traditional
public schools in the United States? This study provides empirical evidence on this question by relying on a panel design
that uses school-level data from two states that have experimented with charter schools for more than 15 years: Ohio
and Texas. Using county-level, spatial, and enrollment-based measures of charter exposure, the changes from pre- to post-
charter-legislation stages in the student compositions of public schools that do and do not face competition from charters
are examined. The results suggest that charter school presence contributes to aggregate-level changes in the share of non-
Hispanic White and free-lunch-eligible students in traditional public schools in both states in different ways.

continue to investigate their influence on the racial and
socioeconomic compositions of traditional public schools
(Frankenberg et al., 2011; Garcia, 2008; Ni, 2010). The vari-
ation in charter school laws across different states contrib-
utes to the difficulties of understanding with any single study
or method the full range of impacts created by such policies.
Therefore, examining experiences in different states is cru-
cial for acquiring a more complete picture of the influence of
charter schools.
This study takes advantage of the rapid increase in the
number of charter schools in two states, Ohio and Texas, to
investigate whether the expansion of charter schools con-
tributes to the changes in the racial and socioeconomic com-
position of the public schools in these states. Both states had
no charter schools in 1995 but had more than 300 opera-
tional charter schools in the 2009-2010 school year.1 By
using two-period school-level panel data and several county-
level, spatial, and enrollment-based measures of charter
exposure, this study explores the systemic effects of charter
schools on student distributions by addressing the following
questions: (a) Does the presence of charter schools contrib-
ute to the aggregate changes in the racial and socioeconomic
distributions of students in traditional public schools? (b)
How do the sizes and scopes of changes vary according to
different measures of exposure?
Background
While the average changes in the composition of students
served by public schools cannot capture the full extent of
segregation or integration in schools, this study focuses on
composition of student body as a first step in beginning to
understand whether the charter school movement contributes
to how student groups are sorted across schools. Empirical
studies focusing on racial patterns of enrollment in public
schools show that most public schools in the United States
are already highly segregated and that demographics of the
public school system in many areas represent an unbalanced
distribution of students by race and socioeconomic status
(Clotfelter, 1999; Frankenberg et al., 2011; Ni, 2010).
Evidence from other countries, which have experienced
wide-ranging school choice reforms, shows that the schools
have become significantly more polarized along ethnic and
socioeconomic lines than before in some instances (Ladd &
Fiske, 2001) and indicates that unfettered choice could
potentially increase stratification (Schneider, Elacqua, &
Buckley, 2006). The conclusions from research on charter
schools and their effects on student distributions are mixed.
The following two sections focus on the theoretical argu-
ments and the empirical studies, respectively.
Theoretical Arguments
Scholars suggest a variety of reasons why student distribu-
tions might change (Fiske & Ladd, 2000; Frankenberg et al.,
2011; Schneider et al., 2006; Smith & Meier, 1995; Wells,
Holme, Lopez, & Cooper, 2000). First is the influence of
several aspects of parental demand, which is a key element in
the success of any school choice policy. Parents may choose
schools not only for their academic reputation but also for a
variety of other reasons, including peer group preferences
and geographical proximity. If parents value certain peer
group characteristics and sort their children into schools
along racial and class lines, existing stratification may
deepen (Smith & Meier, 1995). Although most surveys of
parents show that all parents value academic quality and that
few refer to the composition of the student bodies in schools,
studies based on the actual behavior of parents found that
parental decisions do appear to be influenced by factors such
as demographics (Henig, 1990; Schneider & Buckley, 2002;
Schneider et al., 2006; Weiher & Tedin, 2002). Another
aspect regarding parental demand is the ability of parents to
make well-informed decisions. Research on other forms of
public school choice has clearly demonstrated that there are
significant information disparities between different groups
of parents and that the average parent does not have very
accurate information about the conditions in schools
(Schneider, Teske, & Marschall, 2000; Schneider, Teske,
Marschall, & Roch, 1998).
Second, despite the racial/ethnic balance enrollment
guidelines some states set for their charter schools
(Frankenberg & Lee, 2003a), schools can influence their
student distributions through a variety of mechanisms
(Wamba & Ascher, 2003), such as recruitment and admis-
sion policies, marketing mechanisms, and transportation to
the school. Wamba and Ascher (2003) described several
examples from different states, such as schools tailored to
specific populations by adopting specific curriculum con-
tent to cater to minority parents or private to charter conver-
sion schools, which take advantage of the new laws to gain
access to government funds without necessarily changing
enrollment. Some of these strategies may lead to concentra-
tions of certain types of students. In addition, the viability
of a charter school depends on its financial resources and
thus its capacity to attract students. When students transfer
from public schools to charter schools, the funding follows
the student.2 Critics worry that the new schools will drain
the already limited funding of traditional schools. They also
worry that financial and academic pressures may compel
schools to avoid high-cost students (Miron & Nelson, 2002)
or that recruitment and admission policies or marketing
mechanisms may affect the profile of applicants (Wamba &
Ascher, 2003; Wells, 2002). Furthermore, whether trans-
portation of charter students is required or left as a parental
responsibility may seriously affect the pool of applicants
(Wells et al., 2000). Keeping these concerns in mind,
researchers warn that existing stratification and segregation
may deepen as choice increases if the necessary institu-
tional arrangements and regulations, such as well-designed
and enforced equity provisions, are not created (Cobb &
Glass, 1999; Schneider et al., 2006; Smith & Meier, 1995;
Wells et al., 2000).
Ertas 3
In contrast, charter school supporters value and wel-
come the competition created by charter schools and per-
ceive these schools as part of the solution to the persistent
segregation and stratification problems. While charter
schools are still public schools, policy allows them to be
free of bureaucratic constraints that affect other public
schools and to develop creative, innovative curricula or to
use new teaching methods in hopes of attracting parents
and students and becoming "public education's `R&D'
arm."3 Charter schools are presented as laboratories that
can test and find better approaches to education that can
transform the larger public education system (U.S.
Department of Education, 2004). Besides creating oppor-
tunities for innovation and incentives for other public
schools, as charter schools do not use established atten-
dance zones, they may weaken racial isolation by expand-
ing choice to families in poor neighborhood schools
(Greene, 2000; Hassel, 1999; Viteritti, 1999). The theoreti-
cal arguments outlined above suggest primarily three ways
for charter schools to induce change in public schools.
First, flexible and innovative charter schools may act as
incubators of new ideas and approaches, which traditional
public schools can adopt. Second, if losing students has
direct financial effects, public schools have an extra incen-
tive to adopt better programs and increase performance.
Third, public schools may also change if charter schools
influence the student composition of public schools by
absorbing more disadvantaged or problematic students or
by attracting the best and brightest students.
Empirical Findings
The empirical research on effects of competition from char-
ter schools is growing (Carnoy, Jacobsen, Mishel, &
Rothstein, 2005; Frankenberg et al., 2011). Much of the
earlier research regarding this issue is cross-sectional com-
parisons of whom the schools are serving (see, for example,
Finn, Manno, & Vanourek, 2000; Frankenberg & Lee,
2003a; Nelson et al., 2000). Earlier National Study of
Charter Schools sponsored by the U.S. Department of
Education concludes that the proportion of White students
in charter and public schools is about the same, providing
no evidence of increased segregation (Nelson et al., 2000).
During the same period, in the Charter Schools and Race
study sponsored by the Harvard Civil Rights Project,
Frankenberg and Lee (2003b, 2006) compared racial com-
position and segregation of charter schools by state and
concluded that charter schools are largely more segregated
than public schools.
Other studies, primarily focusing on academic perfor-
mance, examined whether charter schools absorb more
advantaged students from public schools and worsen
school systems for troubled students, which is sometimes
referred to as the academic skimming problem. Hoxby
(2003) found that on average students with lower grades
transferred to charter schools in Chicago, suggesting no
skimming on an academic basis. Hanushek, Kain, and
Rivkin (2002) in Texas; Booker, Zimmer, and Buddin
(2005) in California and Texas; and Bifulco and Ladd
(2004, 2006) in North Carolina used student-level data that
enabled them to track the moves of students from tradi-
tional public schools to charter schools or back over time.
All three studies found that the charters might lead to addi-
tional racial and ethnic concentrations, primarily because
of black charter school students selecting into more racially
isolated schools. More recent studies examining data from
Michigan (Ni, 2007, 2010) and Arizona have reached simi-
lar conclusions of charter school intensifying the isolation
of disadvantaged or minority students in especially some
urban schools and for some grade levels more than others.
Petrilli (2009) found promising effects toward integration
in D.C. schools that use specific and carefully designed
diversity policies such as a lottery system to recruit student
that takes into account the already segregated neighbor-
hood patterns.
Three studies used variations of the difference-in-
differences estimates, also utilized in this article, to study
the effects of charter schools on student composition of
public schools. The basic idea behind the difference-in-
differences estimator is to model the treatment effect by
estimating the difference between outcome measures at two
time points for the treated and the control observations and
then comparing the difference between the groups (Buckley
& Shang, 2003; Card & Krueger, 1994). Hoxby (2001), in a
study of the effects of charter schools on the achievement
of public school students in Arizona and Michigan, defined
treatment school districts as those where charter schools
account for more than 6% of district enrollment, based on
average annual enrollment change in a Michigan school
(which was 5.1% prior to 1994). The findings reveal that
the Michigan and Arizona public schools raised achieve-
ment in the face of competition from charter schools and
that the increased achievement was not a result of cream-
skimming of students. Dee and Fu (2004) compared
changes in the student-teacher ratio and racial segregation
in Arizona, which introduced charter schools, and New
Mexico, which did not. They found that charter schools
drew White non-Hispanic students from traditional public
schools and caused a reduction of resources in Arizona. In
a district-level analysis, Ross (2005) estimated the effects
of charter school presence on the segregation of traditional
public schools within districts in Michigan. The analysis
measured charter presence first with dichotomous variables
indicating existence of a single- or multiple-charter schools
within a district then with dichotomous variables indicating
that the charter schools account for below or above 7% of
district enrollment (the median enrollment rate in Michigan
in 1999). The results show that several forms of public
school segregation have been exacerbated in Michigan dis-
tricts with high levels of charter school enrollment.

Data and Method
Regression models relying on the difference-in-differences
estimation method are used to model the charter school
exposure effect by estimating the difference between out-
come measures at two time points for charter-exposed
schools and the control schools and then comparing the dif-
ference between the groups. Both states had no charter
schools in 1995, but by 2009, both had more than 300 charter
schools. Using the 2009 data, schools are categorized as
those that face competition and those that do not, and then
the differences in the outcome measure between these groups
of schools are compared--First, the differences between the
schools are compared in 2009, and then the same difference
between the same schools are compared in 1995 to control
for potential disparities between the two before charter
schools existed. Then, the difference between the differences
is compared, hence the name difference-in-differences.
The data used in this study come from multiple sources.
The main school-level data are drawn from the National
Center of Education Statistics (NCES) Common Core Data
(CCD) for the 1995-1996 and 2009-2010 school years to cre-
ate two-period panel data of traditional public schools in
Texas and Ohio. The CCD is a comprehensive, annual,
national statistical database on all public elementary and sec-
ondary schools in the United States. The school-level data
include information on the racial and ethnic composition of
students and on the number of students on free or reduced-
price lunches. The first period represents the last year before
any charter schools were established and the second period
includes the data from the recent post-charter-legislation
environment that can be matched with current county-level
data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Table 1 shows the number
of charter and traditional public schools and students in these
states based on U.S. Department of Education data. Both
states had no charter schools in 1995, then by the 2009-2010
school year, 323 charter schools were operational in Ohio
and 536 in Texas. A higher percentage of public schools are
charter schools in both states in comparison with national
averages. About 4.7% of public schools are charter schools
in the nation, compared with 8.5% of Ohio schools and 6.2%
of Texas schools.
After data on all schools from each state for pre- and
postlegislation periods were extracted from the CCD,
charter, special, vocational, and other alternative schools
were removed.4 Then, the schools that were not operational
for both periods were taken out, as they cannot be used for
panel estimates. This reduced the sample size to 2,884
schools operational in both periods in Ohio and 5,456 tradi-
tional public schools operational in both periods in Texas.
Data on charter schools were used to create a series of inde-
pendent variables, which are described in detail in the fol-
lowing section.
Dependent Variables
The two main dependent variables for this analysis are the
percentage of students who are non-Hispanic White and the
percentage of students who are eligible for free or reduced-
price lunches. The first outcome variable was used to track
the changes in the concentrations of minority and non-His-
panic White students. Proportion of non-Hispanic White stu-
dents is a commonly used and reported education indicator,
also featured in the Department of Education's publications
as an important indicator of the condition of education in the
United States. The second outcome variable provides a proxy
measure of low-income family status. Previous research has
found an association between higher percentages of students
who are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches and lower
average academic scores in schools.
Competition Measures
To categorize schools into those that are heavily exposed to
charters and those that are not, three criteria (specifications)
have been used. First, traditional public schools that have
one or more charter schools in the same county are compared
with other schools that do not have any charter schools in the
same county. Second, the traditional public schools that have
one or more charter schools within a 5-mile radius is com-
pared with other schools that do not have charter schools
nearby. Third, the percentage of public school students that
are enrolled in charter schools in each county for school year
2009 is calculated. Traditional public schools that operate in
counties with above-median charter school enrollment were
compared with other traditional schools located in counties
with less than median charter enrollment.5 Special and voca-
tional charter schools were also removed similar to the main

public school data set. This means that the analyses do not
include those charters opened to serve students with specific
disabilities exclusively.6
Following the literature that points out the importance of
location in school choice and the studies focusing on compe-
tition effects, the first two of these measures are spatial in
nature. Location is an important determinant of charter school
selection by parents, especially for minority and low-income
households, because although charter schools are open to stu-
dents from outside the school district, the transportation costs
of switching to distant schools would be higher for them
(Henig & MacDonald, 2002; Kleitz, Weiher, Tedin, &
Matland, 2000). In creating the groupings, public schools that
have at least one, five, or more, or nine or more charter
schools in the same county are compared with other public
schools. As all these three specifications produced similar
results, comparisons are reported using the first measure.
Because counties vary widely in size, the number of schools
per county may not reflect the actual competitive pressure
some schools face. Geographic variables based on spatial
proximity may provide a better measure to group schools.
Therefore, a spatial equation was used to convert latitude and
longitude differences between traditional public and charter
schools into actual distances in miles on the surface of the
earth.7 Then, these distances were used to count the number
of charter schools within 5 and within 10 miles of each tradi-
tional public school. These two spatial specifications pro-
duced similar results. Thus, the second measure on which the
schools are grouped and the results are reported is whether the
traditional public school has at least one charter school within
a 5-mile radius. The third charter exposure measure was
based on enrollment. The share of public school population
enrolled in charter schools still represents a minor portion of
the total enrollments in these states, so schools that are located
in counties with heavy charter attendance may feel more
competitive pressures to maintain their student populations.
Control Variables
Many social and demographic characteristics are likely to
influence the student composition of schools, such as the
racial composition of the local population and levels of pov-
erty. For example, if there is a general increase in the poverty
levels of the school-aged population in the area over the time
period of this study, we would expect to see an increase in the
share of free-lunch-eligible students in the schools. Charter
schools are not confined to students living in the district
where the school is located; in fact, the point of choice
schools is to enable families to choose schools outside of the
traditional school district if they want to. Therefore, to con-
trol for other factors that may cause changes in the dependent
variables from 1995 to 2009, the models include county-
level economic and demographic indicators. These controls
show the changes between the pre- and postlegislation years
in the percentage of 5- to 17-year olds in poverty, the
percentage of the 5- to 19-year-old county population who
are White non-Hispanics, logarithmic transformation of total
county population, and the real median household income.
The data for these control variables come from Small Area
Income and Poverty Estimates of the U.S. Census Bureau
(2010).8 Charter schools are alternatives to not just tradi-
tional public schools but also to private schools. Changes in
the size of the private school population may also affect out-
come measures; therefore, the proportion of private school
enrollment per county was also included as a control.9 To
calculate what percentage of students attends private schools
within a county, the Private School Survey (PSS) data from
1995 and 2009 school years were used.
Statistical Analysis
First, the changes in the mean values for the two outcome
measures for the groups of schools were investigated. To test
whether the observed effects were driven by changes across
counties during that period, a school fixed effects regression
model, which allowed inclusion of controls for other possi-
ble factors for the change, was used. The model takes on the
following form10:
Y T T C
it it
= + + + × +
    
0 1 2 3
X ( ) ,
where Y
it
is the dependent variable for school i in year t, X
is a vector of control variables, T is a year dummy coded 1
for observations in the 2009-2010 school year, and C is the
competition measure. The parameter of interest is on the
interaction term (T × C). The coefficient 
3
measures the
changes unique to schools that face competition after the
introduction of charter schools.
Endogeneity is a common problem in this type of educa-
tional policy and program evaluations that use observational
data. The main problem stems from the fact that the units of
observation may not be randomly assigned to participate in
the policy or program in question. In the context of this study,
it is possible that the observed effects of charter school pres-
ence on the proportion of non-Hispanic White and free-
lunch-eligible students in the nearby traditional public
schools actually represents preexisting trends that are also
driving the location of the charter schools. Although the dif-
ference-in-differences estimation method provides a simple
yet powerful technique for estimating treatment effects with
observational data (Buckley & Shang, 2003), it is impossible
to control for everything completely, especially in an open
policy area such as school choice. In using this estimation
technique, the models compare the differences between
groups of schools as well as the differences of pre- and post-
charter-legislation measures so that time-invariant factors
that may have affected the student composition and charter
school location were differenced out.
Previous research utilizing variants of the estimator has
generally used observations from some other control state
6 SAGE Open
that did not experience the policy intervention, for exam-
ple, a neighboring state that did not have charter schools.
The selection of the control state is very important and
often turns out to be grounds for critique, as the model is
based on the assumption that the contemporaneous changes
in the control state reflect the similar unobserved and time-
varying determinants of the treatment state. As there are
many variations in the charter laws and educational histo-
ries, as well as regional demographic trends in different
states, in this article, multiple competition criteria within
the same state were used to assign schools to treatment and
control groups. This ensured that the treatment and the
control schools are affected similarly by other unmeasured
factors such as other statewide policies. It should be noted
that in states with charter laws, all schools, including those
that do not have any charters in their county, can be affected
by the charter schools. They may not be directly exposed
to the risk of losing students who transfer to charters close
by, but the possibility of new charter schools opening in
the area may be enough to stir change. In other words,
there is no pure control group. If this is true, then the
results from these analyses will underestimate the true
charter school effect.
Results
Table 2 shows the racial composition and the percentage of
students eligible for free lunches in traditional and charter
public schools in the two states based on the sample in com-
parison with national figures. The charter laws vary from
state to state, reflecting the varying educational histories and
the power of different political and civil groups supporting or
opposing charter schools. Some of the provisions in state
laws may have direct implications for charter schools'impact
on the public education system. In Ohio, racial/ethnic bal-
ance provisions simply indicate that the racial and ethnic bal-
ance of the schools should not differ from the composition in
the community, whereas Texas charter law contains no spe-
cific discrimination provisions (Frankenberg & Lee, 2003a;
U.S. Charter Schools Website, 2006). Despite the racial and
ethnic balance guidelines, both states have racially imbal-
anced enrollments. In both states, the percentage of black
students in charter schools is exceptionally higher than that
in public schools. In Ohio 38.7% and in Texas 20.1% of pub-
lic charter school students are non-Hispanic White (com-
pared with 37.3% of charter school students and 54.8% of
public school students nationwide). Charter schools also
serve slightly higher proportions of free lunch eligible stu-
dents in both states.
Results from the three criteria used to measure charter
school presence are reported in Table 3. As discussed previ-
ously, the first treatment group includes traditional public
schools that have one or more charter schools in the same
county (3,904 schools in Texas and 2,074 schools in Ohio).
The second treatment group includes traditional public
schools that have at least one charter school within a 5-mile
radius (2,865 schools in Texas and 1,442 schools in Ohio).
The third treatment group includes traditional public schools
that are located in counties where charter schools enroll
more than the median percentage of public school students
(2,738 schools in Texas and 1,449 schools in Ohio). Basic
means estimates in Table 3 show that the average share of
non-Hispanic White students fell more in traditional public
schools that faced competition from charter schools in both
states from the 1995-1996 school year to the 2009-2010
school year. There is also a decrease in the share of non-
Hispanic White students in other control schools, although
the size of the change is considerably smaller. This implies
that the introduction of charter schools may have caused this
reduction. However, charter schools may be located in coun-
ties with different racial compositions in the first place. If
the location choice is nonrandom, the observed effects can
be biased. The difference-in-differences approach deals
with part of this issue by looking at the contemporaneous
changes in the control schools, which have no charters in
their county or within their spatial proximity. This is because
the estimates control the differences between the two groups
before the implementation of the policy.

When the difference of the differences between the two
groups are calculated (for example, -10.0 to -3.8) in Ohio to
separate the impact of charter schools, the initial results show
that the introduction of charter schools leads to a 6.2 percent-
age-point decrease in the share of non-Hispanic White stu-
dents in Ohio traditional public schools that face charter
competition in their county. The spatial and enrollment-
based measures show similar but overall slightly larger
results.
In the models for free- and reduced-price-lunch-eligible
students, the basic estimates show effects in different direc-
tions across states. The estimates show that the average share
of free-lunch-eligible students in traditional public schools
rose by 7.9 percentage points with the county-level measure
and 13.9 percentage points with the spatial measure and 11.2
points with the enrollment-based measure from the 1995-
1996 school year to the 2009-2010 school year in Ohio. In
Texas, the differences of the differences are negative--the
share of free-lunch-eligible students increased in this time
period for the treatment and control schools, but more for the
control schools, suggesting that charter schools contribute to
the reduction in the share of free-lunch-eligible students in
traditional public schools.
The changes in the means suggest some statistically dis-
tinguishable effects that may occur due to charter presence,
but they are only average changes across the groups of
schools in those states in this time period. Tables 4 and 5
present the results from the fixed effects regression models
that incorporate the demographic and economic controls. In
these tables, the coefficient of interest is the interaction term
between the postlegislation year and the competition vari-
able. The first column for each state shows the results from
the first county-level exposure measure (C1 = school has one
or more charters in the same county), the second column
shows the results from the models with the second spatial
exposure measure (C2 = school has one or more charters
within a 5-mile radius), and the third column shows the
enrollment measure (C3 = school is in county with above-
median charter enrollment). Significant results are marked
with asterisks.
The regression results suggest that the existence of charter
schools contributed to the reduction of the share of non-His-
panic White students in traditional public schools that face
charter competition in both states. The size of the effect and
the sensitivity to the competition measure varies across
states, but the overall negative effect remains significant
across models. The initial differences in the means for Ohio
schools show the largest change in the share of non-Hispanic
Whites in public schools with a decline of 6.2 percentage
points. With the addition of county-level controls, the size of

the effect is reduced to 4.9 percentage points but remains
significant. For the schools that experience direct competi-
tion within a 5-mile radius, the share of non-Hispanic White
students is reduced by 7.6 percentage points. With the addi-
tional controls, the size of the coefficient is reduced to 6.3
but remains highly significant. In the models with the enroll-
ment-based measure, the basic model shows a 6.7 percent-
age-point decrease in the share of non-Hispanic White
students in the treatment group. The change reduces to 6.1
percentage points with the controls but remains highly
significant.
In Texas, schools that have charter schools in their coun-
ties saw the non-Hispanic White percentages of their students
drop by a statistically significant 6.5 percentage points more
than schools in other counties. Introducing the county-level
controls reduces the size of the coefficient to 4.3 percentage
points, but the coefficient remains significant. Schools with
charter schools within 5 miles saw the non-Hispanic White
percentage drop 5.6 percentage points more than schools
without competition that close. With control variables, we
still observe a statistically significant 4.1 percentage-point
reduction. The results with the enrollment-based specification
also suggest that the introduction of charter schools reduced
the share of non-Hispanic White students in traditional public
schools by 4.2 percentage points even after controlling for
changes in the county populations and demographics. In sum,
for the racial composition outcome, all models show signifi-
cant and negative effects.
The results from the free-lunch-eligible models are pre-
sented on the right sides of the tables. The results suggest
that charter presence in these states is associated with the
share of free-lunch-eligible students in traditional public
schools, but the size and direction of the effect vary across
states. The results for Texas show reductions in the share of
free-lunch-eligible students in traditional public schools are
in counties that experience heavier charter exposure. Relative
to schools without charter schools in their counties, schools
with one or more charters in their counties experienced
approximately a 2.8 percentage-point drop in their share of
free-lunch-eligible students. With the addition of county-
level controls, the size of the effect actually increases to 5.1
percentage points and remains significant. In the models

with the spatial measure, charter school presence again con-
tributes to the reduction in the share of free-lunch-eligible
students--by a statistically significant 1.9 percentage
points--and with the additional controls, the effect size again
increases modestly (compared with the first specification) to
2.9 percentage points. For public schools located in counties
with above-median charter enrollment, with the addition of
controls we observe a significant 4.2 percentage-point drop
in the share of free-lunch-eligible students, which is similar
to the results of the other models.
The results from the simple model for Ohio schools show
that the charter school competition contributes to increases
in the share of free-lunch-eligible students in traditional pub-
lic schools. Even after controlling for demographic and
socioeconomic changes, the size of the coefficient shows an
increase of 4.3 percentage points for the county-level speci-
fication and 9.5 percentage points for the enrollment-based
specification. Relative to other public schools, public schools
with charter schools nearby experienced approximately a
12-percentage-point rise in their share of free-lunch-eligible
students. This model produced the largest effect size among
all models. In sum, all specifications show significant
declines in the share of free-lunch-eligible students in Texas
and significant increases in the share of free-lunch-eligible
students in Ohio.
Discussion and Conclusion
Poverty and inequality are the biggest challenges facing
urban public education today and promoting school choice
has gained popularity across the country as a way to address
these long-standing problems. Majority of the states now
have hundreds of charter schools serving thousands of stu-
dents, and advocacy groups are working to pass charter leg-
islation in the remaining states and to modify existing
legislation to allow for growth and success of these schools.
As charter schools continue to proliferate around the country
and to attract public and scholarly attention, their impact on
the public education system comes to the forefront as a major
public policy question. Many discussions of such system-
wide effects revolve around the academic achievement
issues; however, changes in the composition of the student
body is another important dimension of system-wide effects
created by the introduction of charter schools in the public
education system. This study focuses on the racial and socio-
economic composition of students in traditional public
schools in two states that have experienced a certain degree
of charter competition in the last decade. The analysis pro-
vides additional empirical evidence on observed changes in
student distributions by relying on a panel design and school-
level data. The results based on these data consistently sug-
gest that the introduction of charter schools is associated
with changes in the share of non-Hispanic white students in
traditional public schools in both states. The estimates from
the race models are negative and robust at the county-level,
spatial, and enrollment-based specifications, which is consis-
tent with findings from previous research using data from
other states. Charter presence measured in all three ways
showed significant reductions in traditional public schools'
non-Hispanic White student populations, but the magnitude
of the change generally increased in the models with the spa-
tially more precise measure. The controls explained away
some of the change and reduced effect size, but all coeffi-
cients still remained significant. The effect size ranged from
4.1 to 6.3 percentage points across models. The analyses
show that charter school presence is associated with changes
in the share of free-lunch-eligible students in traditional pub-
lic schools during the time period of the study, but in differ-
ent directions. The regression results showed that while the
traditional public schools experiencing charter school com-
petition more intensely saw a decline in their share of free-
lunch-eligible students in Texas, but they experienced an
increase in their share of free-lunch-eligible students in Ohio.
These changes range between 2.9 and 11.9 percentage points.
These results do not suggest that charter schools would
necessarily lead to additional segregation or concentration of
certain types of students. The shifts identified in the models
have shown a more complex aggregate impact than simple
skimming. This suggests that the details of the legislation
and implementation have the potential to minimize any
unwanted sorting. Consequently, it is critical that we keep
track of aggregate changes, especially as the observed asso-
ciations are robust and sensitive to different measures and
significant even after controlling for changes in the popula-
tion and private school enrollments in the area. The current
popularity of the charter schools is undeniable, yet as
Frankenberg et al. (2011) stated "severe lack of essential data
on charters is of concern. Basic questions about the extent to
which charter schools enroll low-income and ELL students
cannot be conclusively answered and represent major
research and civil rights policy concerns" (p. 47). To create
an inclusive school system and realize the integrative poten-
tial of charter schools, more research and systematic data
collection, as well as cooperation and communication
between charter school founders and operators, policy mak-
ers, and researchers are needed. Charter school reform is a
complex policy that has very extensive repercussions on the
public education system. No single study can fully character-
ize the systemic impacts created by charter schools in a con-
clusive manner. In this study, this complex phenomenon has
been studied from a rather narrow empirical perspective, so
it should be noted that this analysis merely points out a pat-
tern, it does not explain it. If charter presence is systemati-
cally associated with declines in the enrollment of
non-Hispanic White students in nearby traditional public
schools, this may imply that some sorting is taking place in
the face of charter competition; however, further research on
the characteristics of the schools and the policies is needed to
explain the underlying mechanisms as this study has certain
limitations that need to be taken into account when
10 SAGE Open
considering the results. First, this study uses school-level
data; therefore, it is important to interpret the results as aver-
age changes that do not apply to each individual charter
school. Second, the analysis deals with only two states and
cannot be generalized to other states, which may have
entirely different experiences with charters. Third, carefully
selected control variables and school-level fixed effects
models utilizing the difference-in-differences estimation are
used to address the influence of preexisting trends, but in
evaluating complex policies involving individual choice, it is
difficult to account for all sources of potential endogeneity.
Keeping these constraints in mind, this study provides an
empirical account of changes in the student composition of
traditional public schools from two states that allow charter
schools. These observed aggregate-level changes over a
14-year period put forward many questions and suggest
interesting avenues for further research that may increase our
understanding of the charter school effect. First, the effect
sizes are pretty small, but that is expected as these schools
are still a minor portion of the educational landscape. Charter
schools may be still too few to create any substantial effect
on the student distributions in the public school system. As
the laws become more permissible and the number of charter
schools increases, are we going to observe larger effects?
Second, why is there a decline in the average proportion of
non-Hispanic White students served by traditional public
schools in these states in the face of charter presence? State-
level data presented earlier show that charter schools serve
disproportionately more black students when compared with
traditional public schools. If charter schools are not enrolling
these White students, does this mean that the schools choose
to locate in areas with already high levels of minority concen-
tration and speed up the ongoing departure of non-Hispanic
White families to other areas or private schools?
Third, while the traditional public schools in both states
experienced reductions in their shares of White students, the
changes in their levels of free-lunch-eligible students were in
opposite directions. Can these dissimilar findings in different
states be reflecting differences in educational histories, provi-
sions in the legislations, and operation of charter schools in
different states? If so, which aspects of legislation and opera-
tion explain the observed difference? One possible explana-
tion is the now defunct 75% provision in Texas charter
legislation. In 1995, the Texas Legislature passed laws allow-
ing 20 open-enrollment charter schools, which increased to
100 by 1997 then eventually to 215 schools and an unlimited
number of open-enrollment charter schools serving students
at-risk of failure or dropping out of school. However, if a
school enrolled 75% or more at-risk students, it qualified as a
75% Rule charter school and was not subject to the cap (Texas
Center for Education Reform [TCER], 2002). This provision
was eliminated in 2001, but the results regarding the share of
free-lunch-eligible students in the models may reflect the
transfer of the at-risk students from traditional schools to
charters under the early 75% rule. Finally, why does the size
of the effects, especially in the models investigating the
changes in the share of free-lunch-eligible students, vary this
much across states and measures? For example, why do we
see the largest effects in Ohio schools that have charters in
close proximity? Examining the landscape in Ohio, it can be
observed that educational management organizations (EMOs)
are very actively involved in the charter schools in the state
(Hill & Lake, 2005). Previous research has shown that EMO-
operated schools tend to be strongly racial segregative for
minority and majority students as compared with the compo-
sition of the sending district (Miron, Urschel, Mathis, &
Tornquist, 2010) and they seek out more Black students but
are also focused on selecting fewer poor students than tradi-
tional public schools (Ertas & Roch, 2012). Could there be a
relationship between the positive and large effect sizes and
the possible inclination of some profit-oriented EMOs to
serve fewer disadvantaged and costly students? What other
policy variables such as racial balance provisions or transpor-
tation requirements in the charter school legislation have
affected these patterns? As the charter schools proliferate, we
can observe the effects in other states in future studies and
hopefully discover differences in operation and legislation
that lead to the most desirable and equitable outcomes.

Notes
1. Texas adopted its charter legislation in 1995, but the first
school opened its doors in 1996. Ohio adopted charter school
legislation in 1996. Most studies of charter schools, with the
exception of large projects funded by U.S. Department of
Education or charter school interest groups focus on a single
state, which limits the ability to generalize from the findings.
The analyses in this article use data from two states that dif-
fer considerably with regard to their demographic makeup
and policy history, to examine whether similar changes exist
in different contexts and whether the direction and magnitude
of the change vary. Two states are in different census regions.
Texas is in west south central division and Ohio is in east north
central division. By 2011 figures, the percentage of Hispanic
Ertas 11
or Latino Origin were 38.1% at Texas, compared with 3.2% in
Ohio. Percentage of non-Hispanic White were 44.8% in Texas,
and 81% in Ohio. The legislation and the history of charter
schools in each state are different as well (see, for example,
Center for Education Reform [CER], 2012, or Greene, 2002).
The charter laws vary from state to state, reflecting the varying
educational histories and the power of different political and
civil groups such as teacher unions. According to charter law
scores published annually by the CER, Texas was ranked as the
29th and Ohio as the 18th most charter friendly in the United
States (CER, 2012). Ohio also opted for a system of multiple
sponsors, as opposed to a centralized approach. Alongside
Minnesota, it is the only other state that allows nonprofit
organizations to sponsor schools (Palmer, Terrell, Hassel, &
Svahn, 2006). In sum, two states in the study were selected
to maximize diversity with regard to geography, social and
political context, and legislative variations. However, it is not
possible to generalize findings from two states to the entirety
of the education system in the country. Future research should
continue to examine student distributions across and within
schools in other states with substantial charter school presence
such as Arizona, California, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, North
Carolina, and Pennsylvania.
 2. One may argue that this incentive will work for charter schools
and regular public schools; however, it is reasonable to expect
charter schools to engage in selective admission policies to a
greater extent than traditional public schools. Most students
are assigned to their neighborhood public schools on the basis
of their residential locations.
 3. The phrase is taken directly from U.S. Secretary of Education's
Foreword to the Innovations in Education: Successful Charter
Schools report (U.S. Department of Education, 2004).
4. School names and the highest grade served were also
reviewed, and schools whose names contained the following
character strings were also eliminated from the analyses: juve-
nile, detention, det., evening, program, center, office, hospital,
homebound, teleteaching, special, headstart, deaf, blind, kin-
dergarten, and early childhood.
 5. The median of counties that at least had one charter school in
2009 is used.
6. By law, charter schools must ensure that students receive
the program and services on their Individualized Education
Programs (IEPs). As charter schools are public schools, under
the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), they
are responsible for ensuring that special education services
are available to students with disabilities. However, previous
research on this topic has shown that charters consistently
serve fewer students with disabilities than public schools, even
when schools for students with specific disabilities are consid-
ered (U.S. Department of Education, 2000). Different reasons
have been suggested to explain this disparity including poten-
tial discrimination against students with disabilities for mon-
etary reasons (Ramanathan & Zollers, 1999), unpreparedness
by school operators (Estes, 2000; Lange, 1997), ignorance by
school operators regarding obligations under the law.Although
the provision of special education services and underrepresen-
tation of students with special needs in charter schools is an
important topic in charter school research, the issue of whether
the needs of students with disabilities are being met is out-
side the scope of this article. As the numbers served by charter
schools increase, future research tracking these students across
schools and those focusing on specialized charter schools will
contribute to this literature.
 7. The equation used is as follows:
Distance = 180 / p × (ACOS ((SIN(p / 180 × lat_1) ×
SIN(p / 180 × lat_2)) + (COS(p/180 × lat_1) ×
COS(p / 180 × lat_2) × COS(p / 180 ×
ABS(long_1 ­ long_2))))) × 69.11,
where lat_1, long_1 and lat_2, long_2 are the latitudes and
longitudes of two points. The result from the equation is multi-
plied by 69.11, which is the approximate number of miles per
degree on the earth.
8. These variables are merged into the Common Core Data
(CCD) files by using county identifiers. All control variables
show changes in the measures between 1995 and 2010.
9. It is important to control for private school enrollment, spe-
cifically when the states have prevalent voucher programs. For
example, Ohio has a number of statewide voucher programs.
Some are small such as the Autism Scholarship Program
that was enacted in 2003 and targets children with autism.
Educational Choice Scholarship Program (or EdChoice) was
enacted in 2005 and serves students who attend public schools
that are in Academic Watch or Emergency in the state's rat-
ing system. The most recent one (Jon Peterson Special Needs
Scholarship) was enacted in 2011 and provides vouchers to
students who have an IEP. These programs allow private
school scholarships to be paid by public funding for students
attending low-performing schools.
10. The dependent variables are changes in outcome measures
between 1995 and 2009. The fixed effects regressions were
estimated using the "areg, absorb" command in Stata on data
in the long format. This is equivalent to adding a dummy for
each school, but the value of each school coefficient is not
shown in the tables presenting results from the regression
models.
