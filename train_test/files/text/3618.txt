Social capital has been defined as connections among indi-
viduals' social networks, including group membership, char-
acterized by trust between individuals and norms of
reciprocity that facilitates collective action and cooperation
for mutual benefit (Kawachi, Kennedy, & Glass, 1999;
Putnam, 2000; Putnam, Leonardi, & Nanetti, 1993). Social
capital is an established health determinant, independent of
other social and behavioral determinants (Giordano, Ohlsson,
& Lindström, 2011), and its dimensions at the individual and
community levels are associated with individual and popula-
tion health (Kawachi, Kennedy, Lochner, & Prothrow-Stith,
1997; Moore, Haines, Hawe, & Shiell, 2006; Viswanath,
Randolph-Steele, & Finnegan, 2006; Yip et al., 2007).
However, questions still surround the relevance of social
capital for health outcomes, and researchers are seeking
measures within specific social contexts to investigate its
effects (Giordano et al., 2011).
To clarify the associations between social capital and
health, a critical step is to differentiate between structural
social capital and cognitive social capital (Harpham, 2008;
Hurtado, Kawachi, & Sudarsky, 2011). Structural social cap-
ital refers to behaviors (e.g., participation in associations)
that facilitate access and influence networks providing social
support or other potentially beneficial resources (Harpham,
2008; Hurtado et al., 2011). Cognitive social capital (e.g.,
trust and reciprocity) refers to values, perceptions, and
expectations regarding social behaviors that provide a sense
of community belonging and safe and stable representation
of reality (Harpham, 2008; Hurtado et al., 2011). In other
words, structural social capital refers to what people do (e.g.,
participation in associations and networks), and cognitive
social capital refers to what people think (e.g., values and

Psychometric Analysis of a Scale to Assess
Norms of Reciprocity of Social Support
in Community-Based and Congregation-
Based Groups

Abstract
Reciprocity, a core component of social capital, is rarely theorized or measured leaving the relationship between reciprocity
and health ambiguous. Historically, reciprocity measures have not been used in the context they were designed causing
measurement error. This multi-phased study was designed to develop and validate a reciprocity measure for formal and
informal groups within communities and congregations as part of a more comprehensive social capital measure. In-depth
interviews (n = 72), cognitive interviews (n = 40), and an expert review panel guided item development and selection for
content validity. South Carolina residents (n = 500) completed the 10-item Reciprocity of Social Support (RSS) Scale during
2008-2010. Construct validity was supported through an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) that confirmed a two-factor model
for the scale for community- and congregation-based groups. Cronbach's  values indicated items were highly correlated for
community groups and church groups. Psychometric analyses of the RSS Scale support convergent and divergent validity for
the community- and congregation-based groups. Mean RSS Scale scores were not statistically different between community-
and congregation-based groups. This scale has proven psychometric properties for utilization in future research investigating
reciprocity of social support in community- and congregation-based groups and will be useful to examine whether reciprocity
(by context and type of group) is associated with physical and/or mental health.

perceptions) that influences individuals' behaviors toward
mutually beneficial collective action (Harpham, 2008;
Krishna & Uphoff, 2002) and is therefore likely to precede
the actions included in structural social capital. For the pur-
poses of this article, reciprocity will be examined through the
lens of cognitive social capital, that is, what people value or
believe they or others in their network would do under cer-
tain circumstances.
Reciprocity has long been of theoretical interest in the
social sciences. In Alvin Goulder's (1960) seminal publica-
tion, he provided a theoretical explanation of reciprocity and
clarified the concept as patterns of returning or responding to
benefits received. He described reciprocity as "moral
cement" that stabilizes social relationships by creating a
sense of obligations to one another (Goulder, 1960). Harpham
(2008) explained that reciprocity as a two-way behavioral
relationship: when someone has helped someone there is an
expectation that the favor will be returned when needed.
Stone (2001) emphasized reciprocity as a core construct of
social capital because it is an indicator of the quality of social
relationships that impacts people's abilities to solve common
problems (Stewart-Weeks & Richardson, 1998).
Social Capital in Faith Groups and
Community Groups
Social capital depends on context at individual and group
levels (Kawachi & Berkman, 2000). Tangible and intangible
resources are a function of specific social connections
(Cattell, 2001). Community participation, through formal
and informal groups, is thought to produce more social capi-
tal (Putnam, 2000) because it facilitates access to resources
(Hurtado et al., 2011) and provides individuals with a sense
that they can solve their problems through collective action
(Hawe, 1994; Zakus & Lysack, 1998).
Putnam (2000) suggests that faith communities may be
the single most important source of social capital in the
United States. Faith communities commonly contribute to
social services and community cohesion through social capi-
tal (Dinham, Furbey, & Lowndes, 2009). In the United
States, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam all have commit-
ments to peace, justice, honesty, service, personal responsi-
bility, forgiveness, respect, and obligation to others that can
contribute to the development of trusting relationships
(Furbey, Dinham, Farnell, Finneron, & Wilkinson, 2006).
Thus far, no studies have examined whether faith groups also
contribute to reciprocity in relationships.
Wald and Calhoun-Brown (2007) estimated that between
three fifths to three fourths of the American adult population
were members of a Christian church. In 2009, 41.6% of
Americans reported attending church at least once a week or
almost every week (Newport, 2010). Church attendance lev-
els varied across U.S. regions, with the highest levels in the
South and Midwest (45%-63%; Newport, 2010).
Furthermore, according to the Corporation for National and
Community Service (CNCS, 2006), U.S. adults have been
more likely to volunteer through religious organizations
compared with civic, educational, political, professional,
hospital, or recreational organizations with proportions vol-
unteering varying by age from 36.5% among 45- to 54­year-
olds to 45.5% among those 65 years and older. No other type
of organization has comparable levels of involvement
(CNCS, 2006). This high level of volunteerism helps account
for the role of faith communities in fostering social capital.
Measuring Reciprocity
Reciprocity is a core part of cognitive social capital (Abbott
& Freeth, 2008; Stone, 2001), and there is evidence that reci-
procity of social support may impact health outcomes. For
instance, a study by Moskowitz, Morris, and Schmidt (2010)
examined reciprocity of social support in a low-income pop-
ulation and found a balanced proportion of giving and receiv-
ing may buffer the effect of stressors more than the absolute
amount of received support.
However, in most social capital studies, scholars rarely or
inadequately theorized or measured reciprocity (Abbott &
Freeth, 2008; O'Brien, Burdsal, & Molgaard, 2004; Stone,
2001), leaving the relationship between reciprocity and
health ambiguous (Abbott & Freeth, 2008). This may be in
large part because social capital constructs are multi-dimen-
sional, not entirely distinct from one another, and the same
questions are often used to measure different constructs, par-
ticularly among the constructs of trust and reciprocity
(Blaxter, 2004). The reciprocity measures that do exist are
often used out of contexts for which they were designed
(Abbott & Freeth, 2008). As a result, measures are often
worded with underlying assumptions about relationships
(e.g., "friends" and "neighbor"), which may not be meaning-
ful to respondents, (Abbott, 2009; Harpham, 2008) if the
terms are not further defined for the respondent. Common
reciprocity measures that use the terms neighbors and friends
include "Have you assisted neighbors or friends? Have your
neighbors or friends assisted you?" (Ziersch, Baum,
MacDougall, & Putland, 2005). In relation to the term
friends, respondents may have various meanings ranging
from friends that receive greeting cards to those called on
during difficult times (Abbott, 2009). Therefore, inferences
regarding the respondents'relationship to his or her "friends"
remain unclear, and may have varied impacts on health
(Abbott, 2009). Common reciprocity measures that use the
term neighbor or neighborhood include the ones mentioned
previously, as well as "In my neighborhood, most people are
willing to help others" (Pollack & von dem Knesebeck,
2004). The term neighbors can also be confusing to respon-
dents because respondents may define neighbor differently
(e.g., a neighbor who lives on the respondents' street com-
pared with a neighbor who lives in the respondents' commu-
nity). Such general terms (i.e., friends, neighbors, and
neighborhoods) may be imprecise indicators of
Pope et al. 3
particularized social capital, that is social capital that occurs
within specific groups of people; therefore, such general
terms may not accurately depict the respondent's relation-
ship in a particular context. To address these contextual mea-
surement issues, Dudwick, Kuehnast, Nyhan Jones, and
Woolcock (2006) recommend that field researchers have a
thorough understanding of the context in which the measures
are developed, so the measures for different groups are rele-
vant and understandable to the local population being stud-
ied. For example, researchers may rely on local cultural or
ethnic idioms that more clearly convey the intended relation-
ship to the respondent.
Other common measures for reciprocity solicit level of
agreement with generalized statements such as "Most people
try to be helpful" in the General Social Survey (Kawachi et
al., 1999) or "People are helpful" and "People look after
themselves" from the World Values Survey (Inglehart,
Basáñez, Díez-Medrano, Halman, & Luijkx, 2004). Such
generalized questions, though simple, do not capture the
complexities of social relationships (Abbott, 2009) or the
social context (Abbott & Freeth, 2008; Stone, 2001). Some
social capital literature presents measures that conflate reci-
procity and trust measures, even though they are two sepa-
rate constructs. Letki and Evans (2005) use both in an effort
to measure trust in a single scale. Newton (1997) advised that
failure to conceptualize separate dimensions of social capital
will confuse our understanding of how these dimensions
empirically operate.
Furthermore, many studies have examined social capital
based on outcomes (i.e., volunteerism and political participa-
tion), but do not examine mechanisms of social capital
(Calhoun-Brown, 2005), such as reciprocity among commu-
nity members, including faith communities. During a broad-
based consultative workshop (Dinham & Shaw, 2012),
reciprocity was identified as a valued aspect of faith com-
munities by congregation-based groups. Members of congre-
gation-based groups said that reciprocity should be measured
to demonstrate contributions for faith communities and to
assess the level of support generated within faith communi-
ties. However, few quantitative measures capture reciprocity
in the context of communities, and no measures exist to
assess reciprocity in the context of faith communities
(Dinham & Shaw, 2012). Thus, these lack of reciprocity
measures leave the relationship of reciprocity and health
unknown in particular contexts; therefore, it is necessary to
develop and refine measures of reciprocity in specific com-
munity settings using qualitative data (Dudwick et al., 2006),
which will help determine whether different types of groups
(i.e., community-based groups and congregation-based
groups) differentially affect health outcomes (Morgan &
Swann, 2004).
The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a
measure of reciprocity for formal and informal groups within
specific contexts (community and congregation) to deter-
mine whether levels of reciprocity differ by context. A scale
that measures reciprocity will allow future studies to exam-
ine whether reciprocity (by context and type of groups) is
associated with physical and/or mental health.
Method
Study Design
A multiphase study was conducted using scale development
methods outlined by DeVellis (2003). The reciprocity scale
development was part of a larger project to develop and test
the Relationships in Community Groups (RCG) question-
naire, a multi-dimensional measure of social capital. The
overview of study phases for the construction of the
Reciprocity of Social Support (RSS) Scale is outlined in
Table 1.
In Phase I, perceptions of norms of reciprocity in com-
munity- and congregation-based groups were assessed using
in-depth interviews to support content validity. In Phase II,
the qualitative data from Phase I were used to generate items
and response categories, which were subsequently reviewed
by an expert panel for content validity. In Phase III, the items
and response categories were evaluated using cognitive
interviews, which led to revisions of the items and response
categories, further assessing content validity. In Phase IV, a
variety of psychometric methods were utilized to evaluate
reliability and validity of the scale, which included the
assessments of construct validity (i.e., convergent and diver-
gent validity). Mean comparisons were also performed for
community- and congregation-based groups. These methods
and results for each study phase are described in subsequent
sections.
The study protocol was approved by the University of
South Carolina's Institutional Review Board. Written
informed consent was obtained for all participants in Phase I
and Phase IV. Oral consent was obtained from participants in
Phase III. The development of the RSS Scale was part of a
study that developed a more comprehensive multi-dimen-
sional measure of social capital for community- and congre-
gation-based groups. Participants in Phase I and III received
US$20 for their time in the study (between 40 and 90 min)
and participants in Phase IV received US$10 for their time in
the study (between 20 and 60 min). The limitation to
Christians was solely for the qualitative portion of the survey
development: the structure and language of the scale reflected
those of Christian faith because of the initial setting of pre-
liminary work.
Study Setting
The setting for study phases was in South Carolina. In effort
to include participants with varied racial, educational, and
income levels, participants were recruited from eight coun-
ties across the state.

Phase I: Conceptual Framework and Qualitative
Methods
The methods in which the reciprocity of social support items
was developed contributed to content validity. Phase I was
guided by a conceptual framework (see Figure 1). Trust has
been shown to be inversely associated with common mental
illnesses (De Silva, McKenzie, Harpham, & Huttly, 2005).
Therefore, it would not be surprising for people with mental
illness to score low on individual social capital scales (i.e.,
trust and/or reciprocity scales; De Silva et al., 2005). As
Figure 1 illustrates, high levels of trust often lead to formal
and informal group participation, and high levels of social
participation often result in increased trust between group
members (Lindström, 2004), although limitations of physical
health may reduce social participation (Yong, 2012). The
research team theorized that as members experience inter-
personal trust with group members, they may also experi-
ence reciprocity of social support and a sense of belonging to
the group that leads to future experiences of trust, reciprocity
of social support, and a continued sense of belonging experi-
enced between group members. Furthermore, individuals
may experience enhanced positive mental health outcomes
and have downstream effects of protective and improved
physical health outcomes.
From the theoretical framework, investigators developed
an in-depth interview guide using open-ended questions to
elucidate participants' values, perceptions, attitudes, and
opinions regarding social capital constructs, including reci-
procity between group members (Krishna & Shrader, 1999).
Interview items included (a) study participants' group par-
ticipation in the past year; (b) identification of the one group
that was most important to them; (c) for the identified group,
participants commented on the other group members' inter-
est in helping others (Krishna & Shrader, 1999), which
investigated the cultural norm and values held about reci-
procity within the group (Stone, 2001); and (d) the benefits
received from the connections within the groups, which
informed whether participation in social networks was due to
a norm of reciprocity (e.g., act out of obligation or for the

networks (Stone, 2001).
Phase I: In-Depth Interviews
Prior to the current project, several of the authors imple-
mented a congregation-based holistic health intervention
aimed at older adults meeting in small, interracial groups.
Named Heart, Soul, Mind, and Strength (HSMS), groups
met weekly for 2 hr over a 1-year period. Participants from
that program were included in Phase I of the study because
investigators thought there may be additional mechanisms
related to social capital that resulted in broader health
benefits.
In 2008, in-depth interviews were conducted (n = 72).
Phase I inclusion criteria for participants were African
American and White adults (ages 50 and above) who were
residents of South Carolina. Phase I study groups were
defined by three levels of religious participation: (a) HSMS
participants (n = 24), (b) regular attendees of religious ser-
vices who were not HSMS participants (i.e., attended reli-
gious services at least once a month; n = 24), and (c)
infrequent/non-attendees of religious services (i.e., did not
attend religious services more than twice a year; n = 24),
each level stratified by race--AfricanAmerican and White--
for a total of six study groups of n = 12 each. The HSMS
participants were randomly selected to participate in the in-
depth interviews. Regular attendees of religious services and
infrequent/non-attendees of religious services were selected
using a snowball sampling method from eight counties in
South Carolina.
All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and
researchers provided hand-written notes for each interview.
Interviews were coded using QSR NVIVO7 software (QSR
International, Burlington, Massachusetts, United States).
Each transcript was independently reviewed and analyzed
by two researchers (H.C.P. and M.C.M.) using an open cod-
ing process (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). Themes were identi-
fied across the six study groups based on supporting
comments from at least two participants. Coders met on a
frequent basis to discuss and compare the themes they iden-
tified independently and discussed coding issues until agree-
ment was reached. The codebook contained a list of defined
codes.
Phase I: Results
Seventy-six percent (n = 55) of the participants were women.
All participants were 50 years or older (M = 66 years, SD =
10.90). Table 2 highlights Phase I participant demographic
characteristics. Thematic analysis identified the types of
groups to which participants belonged (i.e., community- and/
or congregation-based groups); the most important groups in
which they participated (i.e., community- and/or congregation-
based groups); their group's interest in helping others,
whether within and/or outside their group; and reported ben-
efits of group participation, usually described in terms of the
social support participants provided and/or received in their
group. Comments reflected the types of social support expe-
rienced: tangible, emotional, informational, positive social
interaction, and spiritual (Krause, 2002; Sherbourne &
Stewart, 1991).

aWhen congregation-based groups were assessed, the phrase church group was used
in place of community group.
Phase II: Item Development
The social capital literature and results of the thematic analy-
sis guided the development of a large pool of items and
served to support content validity of the measure. During the
second study phase, investigators developed 63 items to
measure reciprocity of social support. An expert review
panel with relevant expertise in medicine, social work, social
determinants of health, epidemiology, and health promotion,
played an integral role by helping to guide the development
of the questionnaire. The panel met twice a month for
approximately 6 months to determine which questions to
include in the social capital measures. Item inclusion was
based on items that were theoretically congruent with the
reciprocal nature of social support provided and received in
a group setting, consistent with the literature or qualitative
findings, and structurally appropriate (i.e., concise, not dou-
ble barreled, without multiple negatives; DeVellis, 2003).
Phase II: Item Selection
The reciprocity scale development was part of a larger proj-
ect to develop and test a comprehensive measure of social
capital for community groups. Therefore, to reduce partici-
pant burden in this study and in future studies, 10 items were
selected from the item pool based on the relevance to the
study population from the original 63 items. Five items were
selected to measure the likelihood the participant would pro-
vide social support to group members, and 5 items were
selected to measure the likelihood the participant would
receive social support from group members.
Items were informed primarily by the work of Sherbourne
and Stewart (1991). The item on emotional support, that is,
positive feeling from experience with group members was
derived from participant comments about helping others or
being helped during times of personal and emotional diffi-
culties, producing the phrase following the stem "to get
through a difficult time emotionally." Positive social interac-
tion, defined as the availability of sharing enjoyed activities,
was reflected in the item "to do something enjoyable with."
Informational support, offering or receiving advice, informa-
tion, guidance, or feedback, was assessed by the item "to
share (your/their) experiences and knowledge." Spiritual
support (Krause, 2002), characterized as support in the realm
of faith beliefs, was based on participant comments about
feeling supported on their faith journey, finding spiritual
guidance, and most frequently providing and receiving
prayers, which led to the item, "to provide spiritual support,
that is, pray for (you/them)." Sherbourne and Stewart (1991)
define tangible support as provision of material aid and
behavioral assistance. Participants commented on assisting
others and/or being assisted usually during an illness, which
led to the item "to take a meal if (they/you) were sick."
Phase III: Cognitive Interviews
The items and question formats for the social capital mea-
sures, including the RSS Scale items, were examined using
cognitive interviews (n = 40) to support content validity.
Cognitive interview participants' demographic characteris-
tics were similar to participants who completed the survey in
Phase IV (see Table 2). Participants were asked to discuss
their reactions to the 10 reciprocity items to identify issues
related to order, comprehension, wording, clarity, and
response categories (Willis, 2005). Field researchers (HP and
MM) and expert review panel iteratively reviewed field
notes and made subsequent changes to the scale based on
participant feedback.
Phase III: Results
The cognitive interviews led to modifications to the page for-
mat, directions, item wording, and response categories. The
sample size was expanded until no new instrumentation
issues emerged; ultimately, cognitive interviews were used
to examine nine versions of the RSS Scale. See Table 3 for
the final RSS Scale items.
Phase IV: Procedures Used for Testing
Psychometric Properties
Following content validation from the in-depth interviews,
expert panel review of scale items, and cognitive interviews,
a variety of psychometric methods were utilized in Phase IV
to evaluate reliability and validity of the RSS Scale, and sep-
arate analyses were run for the community- and congrega-
tion-based groups.
Participants for Phase IV were a convenience sample of
500 adults. Researchers (H.C.P. and M.C.M.) recruited
Pope et al. 7
individuals from various community settings (e.g., parks,
workplaces, laundromats, flea markets, convenience stores,
recreational centers, fund raising events, civic clubs, and
churches) to achieve a diverse sample that varied by age,
race, and education.
Phase IV: Study Measures
In addition to the RSS Scale, other measures developed for
the larger project to assess social capital in community
groups were administered at the same time and included an
11-item RCG Trust Scale and a 2-item RCG Sense of
Belonging Scale, developed by the authors using the same
rigorous procedures as the RSS Scale and will be reported in
separate manuscripts.
RSS Scale. The 10-item scale assessed the social support pro-
vided and received within each participant's community-
and/or congregation-based group. The RSS Scale is displayed
in Table 3. A Likert-type 5-item response scale was used for
all items (1 = not at all to 5 = very likely), which was scored
by taking mean scores of the responses for the 10 items.
Higher scores indicated higher levels of reciprocity of social
support in the group.
RCG Trust Scale.An 11-item scale was developed to assess
trust in community- and/or congregation-based groups. The
scale measured four components of trust: openness, benevo-
lence, honesty, and dependability (Hoy & Tschannen-Moran,
1999).
RCG Sense of Belonging Scale.A two-item scale was devel-
oped to assess an individual's sense of belonging in a com-
munity- and/or congregation-based group.
Lubben Social Network Scale­6 (LSNS-6).The six-item self-
reported scale measured active network size of friends and
family, potential instrumental support, and perceived confi-
dents (Levy-Storms & Lubben, 2006; Lubben, 1988). This
scale demonstrated high levels of internal consistency, stable
factor structures, and high correlations with criterion vari-
ables (Lubben et al., 2006).
Socio-demographic characteristics.Items elicited key socio-
demographic characteristics: gender, level of education,
marital status, race/ethnicity, age, length of residency in cur-
rent community, and length of membership and frequency of
participation in selected group.
Phase IV: Analysis
Data were scanned into Excel© spreadsheets using
Teleform© software, and imported into SAS© version 9.2
for data management and analysis, including descriptive sta-
tistics of participants'demographic characteristics and scores
from the RSS Scale, RCG Trust Scale, RCG Sense of
Belonging Scale, and the LSNS-6.
To assess construct validity, an exploratory factor analy-
sis (EFA) was conducted separately using promax rotation
for community- and congregation-based groups to determine
whether the survey items assessed the same latent dimen-
sions and whether all items loaded similarly for each group
type. According to Hatcher (1994), the minimal number of
subjects for EFA should be greater than 100, or 5 times the
number of variables being analyzed; therefore, the study
groups were an adequate sample size for the analysis.
Convergent validity, a form of construct validity, was
tested by Pearson correlation analyses between the RSS
Scale and the RCG Trust Scale in community- and congrega-
tion-based groups. The theoretical framework predicted the
two scales should have strong positive correlations.
Convergent validity was also tested by Pearson correlation
analyses between the RSS Scale and the RCG Sense of
Belonging Scale. It was hypothesized that the scales should
have strong positive correlations because they are theoreti-
cally related. Divergent validity, a form of construct validity,
was tested by Pearson correlation between the RSS Scale and
the LSNS-6. It was hypothesized that the RSS Scale and the
LSNS-6 assess related although distinct constructs; there-
fore, it was predicted that there would be weak positive cor-
relations between the RSS Scale and the LSNS- 6. Last,
Cronbach's  (Cronbach, 1951) assessed internal consistency
of the 10-item RSS Scale in community- and congregation-
based groups. A "high" value of  (.70) is considered desir-
able in most social science research studies (Nunnally &
Bernstein, 1978).
Phase IV: Results
The average age of the participants (n = 500) was 45.95 (SD
= 17.95), and 68% (n = 342) were female, 54% (n = 268)
were white, 50% (n = 251) graduated from college or had
completed any graduate study, 46% (n = 230) were married
or living with a partner, and 34% (n = 172) had lived in their
community 1 to 10 years. Socio-demographic variables were
controlled for in all subsequent analyses. Phase IV partici-
pant socio-demographic characteristics are presented in
Table 2.
The RSS Scale took a few minutes to complete, but was
administered along with other measures of social capital, so
the entire survey took on average 40 min to complete (rang-
ing from 20 to 60 min).
A repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine
whether RSS Scale scores would vary for individuals who
participated in a community-based group and a congrega-
tion-based group (n = 233). Results indicated that congrega-
tion-based groups had a slightly higher mean RSS Scale
score (M = 4.45, SD = 0.58) compared with community-
based groups (M = 4.36, SD = 0.73), though the difference
was not statistically significant, F(1, 232) = 2.79, p = .0963.

Note. Bold items indicate high loadings (above 0.40).
aItems 4 and 9 (spiritual support) and 5 and 10 (tangible support, that is, take a meal if they were sick) evidenced low-loadings (below .40) for both factors
in the community group members. When the items with low loadings were dropped (Items 4, 5, 9, and 10), the two-factor model was run again with the
six items that originally had high loadings (above .40).
bTotal number of participants exceed n = 500 because each participant could report they belonged to community- or congregation-based groups, or both.
EFA
The responses to the 10-item RSS Scale were subjected to an
EFA using squared multiple correlations as prior communal-
ity estimates. The principle factor method was used to extract
the factors. A rotation was not possible. A scree test sug-
gested two meaningful factors. The results of the EFA are
displayed in Table 4. A factor loading 0.40 is considered
desirable in social science research (Costello & Osborne,
2005).
EFA- and Community-Based Groups
For both types of groups, a two-factor model was used based
on the hypothesis that social support is provided and received
by members of a group. For members of community-based
groups, Items 1, 2, and 3, all related to providing support to
other group members, loaded strongly on the first factor (fac-
tor loadings from 0.64 to 0.85) and Items 6, 7, and 8 loaded
strongly (range from 0.60 to 0.78) on the second factor,
related to support received from members of the community
group. Items 4 and 9 (spiritual support) and 5 and 10 (tangi-
ble support, that is, take a meal if they were sick) evidenced
low-loadings (below 0.40) for both factors in the community
group members. When the items with low loadings were
dropped (Items 4, 5, 9, and 10), the two-factor model was run
again with the six items that originally had high loadings
(above 0.40). Results indicated a model fit for a two-factor
model. From the original items, Items 1, 2, and 3 loaded
strongly on the first factor, social support provided to
members of a community group, now ranging from 0.68 to
0.74, and Items 6, 7, and 8 loaded strongly on the second fac-
tor, social support received from members of a community
group, ranging from 0.69 to 0.77.
EFA- and Congregation-Based Groups
For congregation-based groups, a parallel two-factor model
was tested. Items 1 to 5 loaded strongly on the first factor
(0.51-0.82), for social support provided to members of a con-
gregation-based group. Items 6 to 10 loaded strongly on the
second factor (0.60-0.80), social support received from
members of a congregation-based group.
Convergent Validity
The RSS Scale had a very strong positive association with
the RCG Trust Scale for community- (r = .71) and congrega-
tion-based groups (r = .72; p  .0001 for both). The RSS
Scale had a strong positive association with the RCG Sense
of Belonging Scale for community- (r = .60) and congrega-
tion-based groups (r = .625; p  .0001 for both); therefore,
convergent validity was established based on analyses.
Divergent Validity
The RSS Scale had a weak positive association with the
LSNS-6 for community- (r = .26, p  .0001) and congrega-
tion-based groups (r = .15, p = .0110), which established
divergent validity.

Internal Reliability
Cronbach's  values were high and consistent within the
RSS Scale for both study groups. The raw  coefficient for
the reciprocity scale was .92 for community-based groups
and .93 for congregation-based groups, well above the
acceptable level of .70 (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1978). In
community-based groups, the raw  coefficient for the sub-
scale social support provided was .87 and was .89 for the
subscale social support received. In congregation-based
groups, the raw  coefficient for the subscale social support
provided was .87 and was .91 for the subscale social support
received. Removal of any items did not dramatically alter the
internal reliability of the scale. See Table 4 for the results of
the EFA using a two-factor model and Cronbach's  values if
an item was removed for community-based groups and con-
gregation-based groups.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first scale developed to mea-
sure reciprocity of social support that is suitable for commu-
nity- and congregation-based groups that has been created
using a rigorous scale development process. Results indi-
cated that the scale performed very well on tests of reliability
and validity--content validity and different forms of con-
struct validity, including convergent and divergent validity.
Norms of reciprocity were explored in community- and
congregation-based groups using in-depth interviews.
Through cognitive interviews and an expert review panel,
items and response categories were assessed, strengthening
the scale's content validity (Knafl et al., 2007) and readabil-
ity, allowing the scale to be self-administered.
The RSS Scale performed as expected in validity tests.
Scree test findings suggested two meaningful factors. This
procedure helped inform the decision to use a two-factor
model, which reinforced the research team's hypothesis of
the conceptual nature of reciprocity of social support, spe-
cifically that social support is provided (Factor 1) and
received (Factor 2). The EFA provided evidence that the
items capture reciprocity of social support as two-factor
models for both group types. It was hypothesized that there
would be two factors of the reciprocity of social support--
the first, social support provided to group members (Items
1-5), and the second, social support received from group
members (Items 6-10). Results indicated that the norms for
reciprocity of social support in community-based groups
include providing and receiving emotional social support,
positive social interaction, and informational social support,
which has been found to have protective effects on mental
health (Berkman & Glass, 2000; Gjerdingen, Froberg, &
Fontaine, 1991; Janevic et al., 2004). Spiritual and tangible
social support did not have adequate factor loadings in a two-
factor model for community-based groups; therefore, these
items (4, 5, 9, and 10) can be excluded when measuring reci-
procity of social support in community-based groups.
However, the results of the EFA for norms of reciprocity
in congregation-based groups included all 10 items.
Therefore, the additive value of belonging to a congregation-
based group compared with a community-based group may
stem from providing and receiving spiritual and tangible
social support. For future studies, the full scale may be used
to explain the buffering effects of congregation-based groups
on health outcomes compared with community-based
groups.
As hypothesized, tests of convergent validity supported
very strong positive correlations between the RSS Scale and
the RCG Trust Scale for the community- and congregation-
based groups (r = .71, .72; p  .0001 for both study groups)
and strong positive correlations for the RSS Scale and the
RCG Sense of Belonging Scale for the community- and con-
gregation-based groups (r = .60, .625; p  .0001, for both
study groups). Tests of divergent validity of the RSS Scale
and the LSNS-6 demonstrated a weak positive association
for the community- (r = .26, p  .0001) and congregation-
based groups (r = .15, p = .0110).
The Cronbach's  values obtained in this study indicated
that the items for community groups ( = .90-.91) and church
groups ( = .92-.93) were highly correlated.
Results of this study provided evidence that community-
and congregation-based groups contribute to reciprocal
social support. Although results indicated that congregation-
based groups contribute to higher levels of reciprocity of
social support, levels were not significantly higher than com-
munity-based groups and thus do not confirm a difference in
reciprocity of social support for these groups. However, the
differences in item loadings for four factor suggest there are
aspects of reciprocity that differ between the two types of
groups. Currently, there is a lack of literature comparing reci-
procity of social support in community- and congregation-
based groups, so there is no empirical literature with which
results can be compared. Further research is needed to
explore whether significant differences in levels of reciproc-
ity of social support exist within particular community- (e.g.,
volunteer groups) and congregation-based groups (e.g.,
faith-based support groups, prayer groups).
Although reciprocity is a core construct of social capital
(Stone, 2001), little is known about it, as it is very rarely
theorized, defined, or measured (Abbott & Freeth, 2008).
Previous studies suggest that reciprocity is an indicator of the
quality of social relationships (Stone, 2001), results in tan-
gible and intangible resources (Cattell, 2001), facilitates
access to resources (Hurtado et al., 2011), and impacts peo-
ple's abilities to solve common problems through collective
action (Hawe, 1994; Stewart-Weeks & Richardson, 1998;
Zakus & Lysack, 1998). Therefore, a valid and reliable mea-
sure of reciprocity is needed to determine if reciprocity of
social support experienced in different types of groups (i.e.,
community-based groups and congregation-based groups)
differentially affect health outcomes; Morgan & Swann,
2004).
10 SAGE Open
To address this paucity, the RSS Scale will now allow for
more sophisticated social capital theories to be examined and
will assist in the advancement of understanding the relation-
ship between reciprocity of social support in community-
and congregation-based groups and the associations of
protective health effects, particularly on mental health. If an
association does exist, reciprocity of social support may be a
targeted strategy for the prevention and management of
chronic illnesses or the maintenance of healthy behaviors.
Kawachi and Berkman (2001) found that protective
effects of social ties on mental health are not uniform across
groups in society. Therefore, this measure may enable detec-
tion of variation in social support reciprocity among com-
munity- and congregation-based groups by demographic
characteristics (i.e., age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and
socioeconomic status).
Limitations
The RSS Scale demonstrated reliability and validity in the
sample in which it was developed; however, these findings
should be interpreted in light of several limitations. This
study used a convenience sample. Participants' reciprocal
behaviors related to social support may not have been repre-
sentative of the larger population. Importantly, religious
homogeneity of the qualitative work and validity sample
limits the generalizability of the scale's validity. The in-depth
interviews were conducted with individuals belonging to a
Christian Protestant denomination and the validity sample
included only individuals of Christian faith. This is an indi-
cation where the scale is relevant for the Christian popula-
tion, but may be less applicable in other faith traditions (e.g.,
Judaism or Eastern religious traditions).
In addition, the in-depth interviews that guided item for-
mation were performed in a population of adults aged 50 and
above; other aspects of reciprocity may not have been cap-
tured that are relevant to younger age groups. Moreover,
women were overrepresented in the in-depth interviews and
during administration of the instrument. However, reliability
and validity testing indicated positive findings when admin-
istered to the study sample that ranged from ages 18 to 94
and to men, which indicates the scale is appropriate to use in
various age groups and for men and women.
Finally, this scale may not be appropriate to use outside
the Southern United States. The scales were developed in
communities across South Carolina, which included high-
income and very-low-income areas; however, further psy-
chometric testing is needed for the scales if used in varied
geographic and developing regions, so the items reflect the
norms of reciprocity specific to the contexts of interest. For
example, participants in this study did not identify self-
esteem as an important dimension of social support, which
refers to others'communications indicating the person is val-
ued (e.g., letting the person know they are competent at
something or have an admired personal quality; Cohen &
Wills, 1985). However, self-esteem has been found to be an
important dimension of support among various populations
in previous studies (Brookings & Bolton, 1988; Cohen &
Wills, 1985).
Conclusion and Future Research
The RSS Scale for community- and congregation-based
groups was developed over a 2-year process, which included
qualitative work for item development and validity and reli-
ability testing. To our knowledge, this scale is the first with
proven psychometric properties that can be recommended
for utilization in future research investigating reciprocity of
social support in community- and congregation-based
groups. An interesting finding from the study, as indicated by
the EFA, was that the norms of reciprocity of social support
for church groups include spiritual and tangible social sup-
port. Future research should focus on understanding the
additive value of belonging to a congregation-based group
compared with other community-based groups, and whether
the additive value of a congregation-based group is associ-
ated with protective mental and physical health outcomes.
Furthermore, our results showed small differences in mean
RSS scores across different group settings (i.e., higher, but
not significantly different scores in congregation-based
groups compared with community-based groups). Further
research is needed to investigate these differences and deter-
mine the implications of reciprocity in specific group set-
tings. Recommendations of future research include adapting
the scale for use in other faith communities and additional
cultures, including developing countries and various ethnic
and religious populations.
