Introduction
Historians of statistics will likely always debate the prove-
nance of the Thomas Mann­Whitney Houston collaboration
that led to the eponymous U-test. Hence, it is vitally impor-
tant to document the origins of innovation that undergirds
research, as it often involves more than simply the applica-
tion of existing methodology. This article tells a story about
crime and a problem-solving methodological approach. It
tells of analytic hoops we jumped through in our research
examining why many types of crime have been falling in
England and Wales (Figure 1) and elsewhere over the last
quarter century.
The purpose of the story is to show how and why we
focused on `data signatures' to analyse the source of the puz-
zling and pervasive crime drops that began in many countries
from the early 1990s (and a little earlier for some property
crimes in the United States). Our focus on the data signatures
found in the crime drop has been useful in eliminating many
of the reasons that have been advanced for the crime drop as
well as for corroborating one of them, at least for now (Farrell,
2013; Farrell et al., 2014).
The story begins in 2006 when we wrote our first research
grant proposal on this topic, and at the time of writing in mid-
2015, our third sequential project is underway. It is begin-
ning to look like a research programme ­ almost as if we
planned it (see, for example, Farrell, 2013, in press; Farrell
and Brown, in press; Farrell et al., 2008, 2010, 2011a, 2011b,
2014; Farrell and Tilley, in press; Tilley, 2012; Tilley et al.,
2011, 2015a, 2015b; Tseloni et al., 2010, 2012, 2014; Tseloni
and Thompson, 2015; Van Dijk and Tseloni, 2012). Our
overarching research question throughout has been: did
security cause some or all of the massive drops in crime? To
cut to the chase, our conclusion so far is as follows:
·
· Security played a key role in the major falls in vehicle
crime and domestic burglary, and probably other
crimes including violence, over the last two decades.
The policy implications are huge: crime policy should
more vigorously encourage the development of security for

data signatures to examine the role
of security in falling crime

Abstract
This article describes realist evaluation research combining data signatures and theories of causal mechanism as a means of
shedding light on why crime has declined in recent years. A data signature is an empirical indicator of how or why something
has occurred. The use of multiple signatures ­ a `dish' ­ from different angles and contexts can, if they point in the same
direction, result in a form of triangulation that reduces the chance of interpretive error. The signatures identified strongly
suggest that more and better security played a key role in the global `crime drop', and in so doing, they rebut rival hypotheses.

those other crimes that are currently increasing. These
include cyber-crime, theft of smartphones and similar high-
value portable electronics, and the growing prominence of
organised crimes such as illicit trafficking of different types.
The realist deal
Key to the research has been a problem-solving approach,
which is consistent with a realist orientation to evaluation
(Pawson and Tilley, 1997). Pawson and Tilley stressed the
development of Context Mechanism Outcome Pattern
Configurations (CMOCs). CMOCs refer to the causal
mechanisms that are activated or deactivated when a pro-
gramme or policy is introduced in a range of contexts lead-
ing to changed regularities, producing an outcome pattern.
The more precisely the changes in regularities can be specified
through the CMOC conjecture, the more confidence can be
had in the conjecture. The problem-solving counterpart to
CMOCs is the development of interventions where prob-
lems are identified (`Scanning'), casual mechanisms gener-
ating them analysed (`Analysis'), measures developed that
with undermine relevant mechanisms generating the prob-
lems (`Response') and evaluations undertaken to determine
whether the problem has been eliminated or ameliorated
(`Assessment'). These terms form the acronym SARA,
which was devised by Eck and Spelman (1987), and has
been widely used to capture this process. In our work, we
began with a puzzling outcome ­ steep, widespread and
unexpected drops in crime rates ­ rather than a programme
to assess. However, the approach we have adopted accords
well with Pawson and Tilley's realist evaluation and with
Eck and Spelman's SARA process.
In particular, the identification of a series of data signa-
tures has been critical to our work. Data signatures per se are
not new (cf. Bowers and Johnson, 2004; Garwood et al.,
2000; Pawson and Tilley, 1997), but their formal demarca-
tion as a methodological tool for crime prevention research
has been spurred on by Eck and Madensen (2009). They find
that `The analysis of crime signature change, as part of crime
prevention evaluations, can improve the internal validity of
evaluation findings'. (Eck and Madensen, 2009: 59). They
highlight the distinctiveness of the mechanisms associated
with different situational crime prevention interventions and
the associated outcome patterns that would follow from the
activation of these mechanisms. Our triangulation work is
consistent with three important points on signatures made by
Eck and Madensen (2009: 69):
·
· Signature changes consistent with expected interven-
tion mechanisms eliminate rival explanations;
·
· Signature changes inconsistent with the expected
intervention mechanism undermine the validity of the
conclusion that the intervention produced the crime
change;
·
· The more specific and prominent the change in signa-
tures, the fewer viable candidate explanations there
can be.

Farrell et al. 3
The more precisely an observed pattern accords with
the expected signature, the more confident we can be in
attributing causality to it, as also stressed by Pawson and
Tilley.
A proto-realist evaluation, to which Pawson and Tilley
refer as one of their exemplars, which also accords well with
Eck and Madensen's emphasis on crime signatures, is
Laycock's study of property marking in South Wales villages
as a means to prevent domestic burglary (Laycock, 1985,
1991). Overall falls in domestic burglary in the villages fol-
lowed introduction of the initiative. Laycock, however,
`directed her outcome measurements towards precise theo-
retically expected effects' (Pawson and Tilley, 1997: 91).
One mechanism might involve retrieving stolen property and
another detecting offenders with stolen goods. Both were
measured but neither found. Laycock conjectured that inten-
sive and persuasive publicity leading to increased perceived
risk to local burglars (remembering that the contexts was iso-
lated villages in a Welsh Valley), deterring them from offend-
ing, might comprise an important mechanism to generate
falls in burglary (the initiative had been highly publicised
when first introduced to encourage uptake in the villages).
Cleverly, Laycock also tracked offending patterns after her
first report was published and received positive publicity,
and immediately subsequent renewed falls in burglary
appeared to corroborate her conjecture. Her conclusion was
that rather than the property marking per se producing
the crime drop, it was the intensive and persuasive publicity
that risks to local offenders were being increased. The out-
come signature was consistent with one but not the other
explanation.
The specifics of the data signature approach as it relates to
the historical crime drop on which our research focused
should become apparent as the remainder of the article
unfolds.
International relations
In parallel with the analysis described below, we examined
the global crime drop. Back in 2007, it was not as well-
known that crime had declined in many countries, and we
confirmed the general finding of others (Van Dijk et al., 2007
in particular) and added to the knowledge base. We used
the International Crime Victims Survey (ICVS) which is a
unique resource as the only cross-national standardised
general victim survey (Mayhew and van Dijk, 2014). It has
been conducted every 3­5 years since 1989 across many
countries, with small but representative national or city sam-
ples and an identical questionnaire. This means its findings
are widely comparable, unlike police statistics which have
definitional reporting and recording differences, and national
crime surveys, which have definitional and survey methodol-
ogy differences (Van Dijk and Tseloni, 2012).
We examined five volume crime types ­ domestic bur-
glary, theft from the person, theft from car, car theft and
assault ­ using multivariate multilevel regression modelling
in an innovative manner: treating the different time periods
of country-level data as repeated measures within each coun-
try to test for a linear or non-linear trend. Three of the insights
this provided will be highlighted here (see Tseloni et al.,
2010 for the full story). First, cross-nationally, domestic bur-
glary and car theft were the first offences to decline, and they
did so from the first ICVS sweep in 1988. Theft from the
person and theft from cars began their decline with the 1995
sweep with assault declining from the 2000 sweep. Second,
volume crime drops were roughly similar across countries
except for burglary which, to the extent that could be deter-
mined with the more fragmented available data, fell faster
outside Europe, North America and Australasia. Third, in
addition to displaying common cross-national trends, the
crimes of burglary, theft from the person and car theft were
highly correlated cross-nationally, while assault appeared
strongly related to burglary and car theft.
The international analysis is an important counterpart to
the analysis that follows. The likelihood that crime declined
rapidly by chance in many countries at a similar time is van-
ishingly small. For us, this implies the possibility of a com-
mon cause which first impeded car thefts and burglaries then,
perhaps via a spill-over effect, other crime types including
violence. In addition, it means that we suspect our England
and Wales-oriented work, described below, has broader geo-
political implications.
Our argument is, thus, that the data signatures we exam-
ine, although relating largely to one country, suggest more
general patterns and hence a way of addressing a major puz-
zle in criminology. Of course to corroborate this, what we
have done would need to be replicated by research in other
countries to determine whether similar distinctive signatures
are found there also.
The other logistic regression
We used the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW,
formerly the British Crime Survey) as our main data source.
It provides data for crimes occurring in 1981 onwards, was
conducted infrequently in the 1980s, biennially in the 1990s
and continually since 2001/2002.Akey feature is that it gath-
ers much additional information including some on security
measures, albeit with varying consistency over time.
We will skip past most survey method issues here, but
experienced readers will know that the task of analysing sep-
arate sequential data files such as those of the CSEW is an
immensely time-consuming task which necessitates great
attention to detail. Each annual survey sweep requires sepa-
rate analysis with new code to be written. It requires signifi-
cant skills such as repeated reorganisation of the files ­ or
what is known to us as the other logistic regression. So we
are surprised and thankful to have made it thus far, and have
two exhausted research assistants ­ who ruthlessly aban-
doned the team once they got their PhDs ­ to show for it.
4 Methodological Innovations
It's a sign of the crimes!
We started by analysing car theft, in part because we believed
its decline to be under-researched (see Farrell et al., 2008).
The first three signatures we identified provide information
on the causal role of security. If opportunity is driving car
theft, then we would expect to see some specific changes
where security measures are introduced to reduce it.
1. The average age of stolen vehicles should increase
because newer vehicles have better security.
2. Door lock-forcing should decline much more than
other means of entering vehicles, due to central dead-
locking systems.
3. Temporary theft for joyriding and transportation
should decline sooner and faster than permanent
thefts for chopping and re-sale ­ because younger
less experienced offenders were more easily deterred.
We find that all these expectations are met. The change in
means of entry to vehicles is shown as Figure 2 by means of
example.
We were able to replicate the results with Australian data
and added a fourth signature to the repertoire when we hap-
pened upon a natural experiment:
4. In Australia, electronic vehicle immobilisers were
introduced in one state (WesternAustralia) in advance
of elsewhere. Car theft fell sooner in that state and
then fell in the rest of the country, both times tracking
the spread of security (Farrell et al., 2011b).
Note that the statistical signatures only make sense when
informed by the theoretical mechanisms by which different
types of security device ought to work: we have information
on central locking, electronic immobilisers (but also mechan-
ical immobilisers ­ often the awkward old steering wheel
clamps known as clubs or crook-locks), car alarms and track-
ing devices ­ and this aspect of the work is described next.
Competing explanations for the drop in car theft would, of
course, have also to be consistent with these specific patterns.
Auto crime and autocorrelation
After releasing an early version of part of the work in a news-
letter (Farrell et al., 2008), we were astonished at the speed
with which teams in other countries replicated and extended
it (though some may have evolved in parallel). By now, with
some variation in method and data, the finding that security
caused the fall in car theft appears true for Australia, England
and Wales, the Netherlands and the United States (Fujita and
Maxfield, 2012; Van Ours and Vollaard, 2013), with support-
ing evidence on the effectiveness of electronic immobilisers
from Germany and elsewhere (Bassman, 2011; Brown,
2013). Not only does the replication bode well, but since
automobile security was improved (often by legislation) at
different times in different countries, together the studies
provide the fifth signature:
Figure 2. Means of entry to vehicles 1995­2010 (CSEW).
Farrell et al. 5
5. The timing and trajectory of the spread of security in
different countries appears to track the introduction
and spread of electronic vehicle immobilisers.
Although it was not part of the research by the present
authors, some confirmation of the likely importance of secu-
rity was identified by interviews with offenders in Australia
(Brown, 2015). Offenders were asked why they thought
property crime had declined and the most popular response
was that it was due to security.
But which security devices work best? And which work
best for different types of car crime? Here, we included theft
from cars as well as vandalism, initially comparing crime
rates for cars without security to those with particular types.
This evolved into what we termed the Security Impact
Assessment Tool (SIAT). The SIAT uses odds ratios of the
likelihood of crime when particular security devices, or com-
binations, are present, to tease out their relative crime pre-
vention effects (Farrell et al., 2011a). The term we adopted
for the measure this generates is the Security Protection
Factor, or SPF, which is the same acronym as Sun Protection
Factor ­ and both measure the units of time, relative to the
absence of protection, after which the user is burnt.An exam-
ple of SIAT output is shown later for burglary. Conceptually
though, what it does is quantify the effectiveness of different
combinations of devices. The SPFs are our sixth statistical
signature and told us that:
6. Specific security devices and their combinations vary
greatly in their security effectiveness, which varies
by crime type, and these patterns fit with theoretical
expectation.
We found tracking devices to be very effective against
car theft but they were not around much in the 1990s when
crime plummeted. Of devices that were, we found elec-
tronic immobilizers to be the most effective, mechanical
immobilisers and central locking systems to be also quite
effective, alarms only modestly effective, and other
devices (window etching, parts marking) of little use.
Theft from vehicles is more likely to be interrupted by
central locking than electronic immobilisers, which makes
sense since a car with only the latter remains easy to break
into but is harder to steal. Car alarms only ever had a mod-
est effect, but it was larger against theft from cars, which
also makes sense (i.e. conforms with theoretical expecta-
tion of how the preventive mechanism works) as the less
experienced offenders committing these crimes are more
easily deterred.
An important finding is that devices work much better
when used in combination. That is, combinations of good
devices produced non-linear benefits. Electronic immobilis-
ers and central locking were dominant but cars with those
plus an alarm and a tracker were found to have a car theft
SPF of 25 against theft ­ that is, to be 25 times safer than a
vehicle without security. The importance of combinations of
devices was confirmed in subsequent analysis of household
security devices and burglary which is detailed next.
Alarming implications
The focus shifted to domestic burglary for the second main
strand of the research. Building on the car theft work, we
applied the SIAT to household security devices. This was
more challenging because of the larger number of burglary
devices recorded in the CSEW. There were nine devices in
total which in principle produce hundreds of combinations.
We identified the most prevalent devices and combinations
and focused our analysis on them. We found that burglary
security devices, individually but especially in certain com-
binations, are much more effective than car security. As
expected, some work better than others and combinations are
particularly effective, sometimes exponentially so. You can
rest easy if you have the combination of: Window locks,
Internal lighting on a timer, Door deadlocks and External
sensor-lighting, which in our shorthand became the WIDE
combination (we had long been using one-letter abbrevia-
tions to summarise the myriad permutations), as shown in
Figure 3 (`External & Internal lights, Window & Door
locks').1 We found WIDE to provide 49 times the protection
of `no security' against burglary. So to prevent burglary, not
just the more the merrier, but the WIDEr the better (Tseloni
et al., 2014; Tseloni and Thompson, 2015).
An unanticipated finding from our research ­ but one that
in some ways gives it that real-world feel ­ is the finding that
burglar alarms appear to be largely ineffective (Tilley et al.,
2015).Although there has been previous research into house-
hold security devices, most of it tends to group security
devices together, so it is possible this has been missed. While
it has long been known that most alarm activations are false
(Litton and Pease, 1984; Sampson, 2011) and therefore may
not mobilise much formal or informal surveillance, it was a
largely unanticipated finding that warrants further research.
Sneaky measures
Two things were particularly troublesome in the early stages
of the research into household burglary ­ so much so that
they potentially falsified the security hypothesis. The first
was that, even before burglary plummeted in 1993, a fair pro-
portion of households already had some security of different
types. The second was that while there was a significant
increase in security levels when burglary fell, it was too
modest to account for the fall. So how, we pondered, could
security be responsible if there was already a fair bit of it and
if it failed to increase hugely?
The answers appear to be quality and combinations. We
strongly suspect the quality of security devices dramatically
improved from the early 1990s ­ but that this is masked in
the simple counts of the prevalence of individual devices.
6 Methodological Innovations
Finding a signature to test this conjecture was challenging.
To try to do so, we developed a sneaky measure that drew on
how we had examined car theft, and looked at how offenders
gained entry (with inspiration for sneaky measures from
Garwood et al., 2000). We grouped entry methods into two
broad types:
·
· Forced entries ­ where security was overcome, includ-
ing lock-forcing on doors or windows, the removal or
breaking of door panels or windows;
·
· Unforced entries ­ where no security was overcome
including unlocked doors, entry with a key, pushing
past the occupant or use of deception.
If it was security that improved, then the signature we
would expect is that burglaries where security was involved
would fall sooner and faster than the others. This is what
occurred, shown in Figure 4. The issue is most evident
when means of entry via doors or windows are examined
separately. It is clear that a reduction in forced entries
accounted for the bulk of the decline in household burglary
whereas other types of entry declined less and declined
later (Figures 5 and 6). While this does not directly show a
change in the quality of devices, it does show that it was
forced rather than unforced entries that declined, for which
the best explanation we can come up with is more and bet-
ter security.
While the data were imperfect, we were also able to gain
some insight into the use of combinations of devices.
Unfortunately, the best data were only available from 1998
onwards but we extrapolated the trends backwards. Rather
uncannily, the extrapolated trends identify a dramatic
increase in the use of combinations of the WIDEr more
effective devices in the early 1990s at the time when bur-
glary began to fall. The same data imperfections meant the
proportion of households without any security devices
appeared to have fallen dramatically in the early 1990s due
to different definition of `no security' prior to the 1998
CSEW. These signatures dovetail well with the analysis of
between-device variation in effectiveness and previous
analysis of the role of combinations of devices against car
theft.
So, there is mounting evidence that security may have
induced the fall in household burglary. But how and why
would security have spread and improved? We anticipate
that the improvement in security occurred via the spread of
home improvements, particularly insulation and double-
glazing (sometimes termed storm windows). Double-glazed
windows have two tougher panes of glass, and have stronger
frames such that breaking them is more difficult. Further,
double-glazed windows and doors tend to have built-in rather
than add-on locks which means they are more likely to be
used (the awkward nut on the bolt is not left lying around or
lost). Figure 7 shows the spread of fully double-glazed
households in the United Kingdom and the drop in burglary
in the 1990s, and while the data are incomplete across the
timespan of the decline in burglary, they are at least some-
what indicative.

Farrell et al. 7
This burglary analysis is detailed in a study that is under
review for publication at the time of writing but versions of
the findings were presented at the conference to mark the end
of our funded research on burglary and an international
conference (Farrell et al., 2015b; Tilley et al., 2015).
Independent support appears to derive from the recent work
of Brown (2015) in Australia. Offenders were asked why
they thought crime had declined and the most popular
response was that they believed it was due to security.
Looming violence
What about violence? This is probably the biggest question
remaining and the topic of our more recently awarded
research grant. We suspect that security played a key role
both directly and indirectly. For some crimes such as rob-
bery, the effect is likely to have been direct. Banks and com-
mercial stores, buses and taxis have all introduced an array of
improved security measures to reduce robberies. A recent US

study demonstrated that taxi-driver homicides fell in the
1990s in those cabs with security cameras installed, relative
to a control group without (Chaumont Menendez et al.,
2014). Older readers will remember the days when bus driv-
ers carried a large bag of fare monies ­ the days before cor-
rect-payment by machine and a secure drop-box for cash.
Late-night shops now tend to have limited cash on the prem-
ises and an array of design improvements. We anticipate that
these and other measures reduced violence in and around
many public and private premises and spaces. Robbery
disproportionately results in homicide, and other homicides
are assaults-gone-wrong, so their decline may have reduced
homicide as a natural statistical consequence.
Alongside the adoption of security technology to protect
their cars and homes, individuals may have become more
crime risk-averse, adopting or modifying their routine

Farrell et al. 9
activities to reduce their exposure to stranger and acquaintance
violence, especially in night-time economy (Ganpat et al.,
2015; Garius, 2015). Here, the distinct signature would include
reduced levels of exposure to risks of stranger violence in pub-
lic places and hence lower levels of actual violence among
previously highly victimised groups showing enhanced pre-
cautionary behaviour. However if `street' crime is more dif-
ficult due to security it is possible that this also nudges
adolescents to stay indoors.
We are also exploring the indirect effects, that is, how
falling property crime may have reduced violence. It may
surprise some generalist readers to learn that most `career
criminals' are not specialists. That is, they tend to commit
different types of crime across the spectrum of property and
violence ­ including sexual victimisation and domestic vio-
lence (Farrington, 1998; Piquero et al., 2014; Richards et al.,
2013; Smallbone and Wortley, 2004). Since most crime is
property crime, they commit mainly that plus a small amount
of violence. Perhaps much of that violence is committed
while undertaking, following-through on, or in the wake of
completed property crimes, which could mean the reduction
in property crime has triggered some of the broader reduc-
tions in violence. So, for example, acquisitive property crime
is a precursor of fencing, and car theft may be a precursor to
crime requiring a getaway vehicle such as suburban burglary.
We term this the keystone hypothesis because the removal of
the volume property crimes may, like the removal of the key-
stone in an arch, have caused all the other crime types to
tumble.
The second main indirect route we are examining is the
debut crime hypothesis. This involves examining the extent
to which early-career offenders who are stifled if their debut
crimes ­ mainly shoplifting, car theft and other property
crimes ­ do not progress to commit the broader array of
crimes including violence. The signatures for this might
include falling levels of acquisitive criminal activity among
younger offenders followed by falls in violence as they reach
later adolescence, while levels of violent behaviour are
maintained in other cohorts whose onset of criminality has
not been inhibited by increases in security relating to typical
debut crimes. Promising evidence on changing criminal
career patterns speaks to this hypothesis (Farrell et al., 2015b).
Hence, we suggest that while there is a great need for further
research into security and the violent crime drop, there are
some promising avenues to pursue.
Conclusion: of signatures and
significance
Triangulation from a variety of data signatures and sources
is, statistically speaking, an oddity. If one indicator has, say,
a 5% chance of error, then two independent indicators,
for example, based on different data sources, imply a
(0.05
×
0.05
=
0.0025) 0.25% chance and three, a 0.0125%
chance, and so on. With the broad range of data signatures
identified to different data, plus some near-replications from
other countries in relation to the car theft and burglary work,
and since these findings fit with theoretical expectation at
different levels plus there is reason to anticipate some broader
application of these findings, then what, statistically
speaking, is the chance of error? Well do not look at us
because we do not know. But we now feel fairly safe sug-
gesting that there is good evidence to support the security
hypothesis while recognising that a long and winding
research road lies ahead.
And we hope for responsible criticism and attempts at fal-
sification, and challenge researchers to identify suitable data
sources that facilitate such efforts. But we would also ask
readers to identify plausible alternate hypotheses that could
account for the various data signatures described herein, for
we cannot. For example, when considering a rival hypothe-
sis, first consider why it might reduce forced but not unforced
entry to households. Then run it past some of the other signa-
tures because a plausible rival hypothesis should be consist-
ent with each one.
Crime drop research falls increasingly into the domain of
modern history. It will require archival research and imagi-
native efforts to pursue. Trawling through the records of
security manufacturers, insurers, construction companies,
the market research industry, business groups and others,
could shed light on where, when and what security develop-
ments occurred and were implemented. In-depth interviews
with experts including ageing offenders or ex-offenders (see
Brown, 2015) and experts involved in security at and around
the time, are required. The clock is ticking on the last aspect
because the likelihood of retirement of domain-specific
experts increases daily. Other sources of information should
emerge as the work progresses, consistent with the nature of
the investigative triangulation approach.
The most important policy conclusion suggested by the
research is that society should put time and effort into encour-
aging elegant security solutions. The process can, we feel, be
accelerated. Government should assist the corporate sector in
reducing its crime emissions ­ products and practices that
generate volume crimes: it took decades to get secure cars,
and we should have had secure phones long ago, while there
is scope for Internet service providers to secure key compo-
nents of the Internet much more immediately.And society has
a significant comparative advantage over even the most adap-
tive of offenders. This story of our use and abuse of statistical
data signatures and theories of causal mechanisms has been a
key component of how we reached this conclusion. Rather
than arrest for the wicked, we advocate elegant design and
secure solutions that remove crime opportunities.
What we have described here is a research programme
that embodies iterative progression and the development of
multiple data signatures to test context-mechanisms outcome
pattern conjectures relating to security improvements and the
crime drop. This investigative triangulation approach sits
within the realist evaluation framework: confidence in a

conjecture can be multiplied where successive signatures
corroborate one another and where alternative explanations
can be compared for their consistency with signatures. The
idea of multiple `signatures' specifically comes from situa-
tional crime prevention and was initially formulated for eval-
uating small-scale interventions to address specific crime
problems. We suspect that the method has more general
application and its use in this article is intended to illustrate
this and to encourage others working in different fields.
There are many sources of data collected using many differ-
ent methods. To mix metaphors, just as we need to select
ingredients from a well-stocked larder to cook a bespoke
dish, so too we need to look to data source larders to select
the ingredients to empirically test our hypotheses. In refer-
ring to a dish, we hope the culinary allusion is not too
abstract, for we regularly taste each doughy signature as it ...
proves.
