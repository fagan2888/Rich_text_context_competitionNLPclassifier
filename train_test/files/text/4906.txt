Abstract
Objective: To investigate associations between running speeds and contraction times in 8- to
13-year-old children.
Method: This longitudinal study analyzed tensiomyographic measurements of vastus lateralis and
biceps femoris muscles' contraction times and maximum running speeds in 107 children (53 boys,
54 girls). Data were evaluated using multiple correspondence analysis.
Results: A gender difference existed between the vastus lateralis contraction times and running
speeds. The running speed was less dependent on vastus lateralis contraction times in boys than in
girls. Analysis of biceps femoris contraction times and running speeds revealed that running speeds
of boys were much more structurally associated with contraction times than those of girls, for
whom the association seemed chaotic.
Conclusion: Joint category plots showed that contraction times of biceps femoris were
associated much more closely with running speed than those of the vastus lateralis muscle. These
results provide insight into a new dimension of children's development.

Introduction
The study of motor development is
undoubtedly one of the most interesting
fields of research into integral children's
development. Shore described the influence
of the neurophysical background on integral
children's development and the impact of
underdeveloped and differentiated levels of
management of movement on this develop-
mental path. He highlighted particularly the
role and impact of early experiences,
approaches, and processes.1 The transition
from a lower to a higher stage of develop-
ment depends on a number of factors, the
most significant being physical growth,
environmental influences, and self-activity.
Among environmental influences, the pres-
ence of stimuli provided by physical/sports
activities is ranked specifically. According to
the theory of integral development, there is a
close relation between a child's physical,
motor, intellectual, emotional, and social
development.2 Children's muscle compos-
ition has attracted increased interest as it
could help us to understand better their
motor and physical development. The inva-
siveness of the approaches used in this field,
however, is the main barrier to obtaining
data on muscle composition. The most
commonly investigated muscles are the
vastus lateralis (VL)1 and biceps femoris
(BF).3 To date, most studies have been
cross-sectional. Longitudinal studies are
rare, and their sample sizes are mostly small.
An important milestone in the research of
skeletal muscle was achieved by Dahmane,4
who, via histochemical and biomechanical
analyses, demonstrated that each muscle of
the human body is unique and that the
skeletal muscles of the lower and upper
limbs have varying numbers and volume
percentages of slow (type 1) and fast (type 2)
twitch fibers. She also showed that it is
possible to demonstrate a difference in the
number and volume percentages of slow and
fast twitch fibers via tensiomyography
(TMG), whereby several contractile param-
eters may be defined.4 The TMG method,
proposed by Valenc
 ic
 in 19905 for the study
of muscles, has the advantages of being
noninvasive and selective. Hence, TMG is a
suitable method for determining the propor-
tion of slow and fast twitch muscle fibers in
skeletal muscles.6
According to Valenc
 ic
 and Knez,7 TMG
can be used to assess skeletal muscle con-
tractile properties, which are related to
muscle composition.4,6 Contraction time is
correlated with the proportion of slow
twitch skeletal muscle,8­10 and it has been
shown that not only the contraction time,
but also the delay time and relaxation half-
time, should be known for a more valid
identification of muscle composition.
Sprinting speed--one of the distinguish-
ing indicators of successful motoric
performance in children--develops through-
out childhood and adolescence as children
grow and mature.11 Running speed during
childhood and adolescence develops in a
non-linear manner owing to the large mat-
urational influences associated with
increased limb length and muscle mass and
the changing intrinsic muscle­tendon prop-
erties. Therefore, failure to master sprinting
may be an enormous barrier, preventing
children from gaining more complex phys-
ical activity skills.11
Surprisingly, little is known about the
association between muscle contraction
times and sprinting speeds. The search in
Web of Science (Thomas Reuters, USA)
and PubMed (National Center for
232 Journal of International Medical Research 45(1)
Biotechnology Information, U.S. National
Library of Medicine, USA) bibliographic
database using the string ``contraction time''
and muscle and speed and (sprint* or run*) at
the time of designing the study revealed no
articles. Therefore, one of the aims when
analyzing the data collected during the
5-year longitudinal study presented here
was to research the associations between
various running speeds and muscle contrac-
tion time category values in 8- to 13-year-old
children using multiple correspondence ana-
lysis (MCA). The following research ques-
tions were posed:
1. What kinds of associations, if any, exist
between running speed and VL and BF
muscle contraction times?
2. What is the difference in running speed
and VL and BF muscle contraction time
associations between boys and girls?
3. What is the difference in running speed
and muscle contraction time association
between the VL and BF muscles?
Participants, materials, and methods
Participants were recruited from three
Slovenian regions in September 2001:
Central Slovenia region, Drava region, and
Coastal-Karst region. Three primary
schools in each region, were selected ran-
domly. Participants came from five
Slovenian towns (Figure 1): two major
cities in central and northeast Slovenia and
three small towns in the coastal region.
Thus, we ensured that the sample covered
much of Slovenia.
The researchers then organized work-
shops for the schools' head teachers, phys-
ical education teachers, children, and
parents with the aim of presenting the
purpose of the study and inviting potential
participants. In total, 300 children aged 8
years at the beginning of this study and 13 at
the end of this study were recruited, 100
from each region. Among them, 265 chil-
dren participated in the baseline study: 138
male (M) and 127 female (F). The selection
process was performed in a random manner

to prevent any possible bias (e.g., gender,
geographic distribution, anthropometric
characteristics). The most important inclu-
sion criterion was good health, although the
researchers confirmed that none of the chil-
dren had a history of neuromuscular dis-
orders or muscle disease. Before carrying
out the research study (baseline or follow-
up), the children and their parents were
informed that participation in the study was
on a voluntary basis and that the partici-
pants could drop out from the study at any
time and for any reason. Additionally, the
researchers pointed out that the results of
the longitudinal study would be used only
for research purposes. On this basis, the
parents of the participants gave their written
consent for the children to participate. All
procedures conformed to the 1964
Declaration of Helsinki and were approved
by the National Medical Ethics Committee
of the Republic of Slovenia.
For the first follow-up study, 263 children
(125 M, 138 F) participated; in the second,
252 children (127 M,125 F); in the third, 179
children (98 M, 81 F); in the fourth, 175
children (98 M, 77 F); and in the fifth (last),
176 children (96 M, 80 F). In total, 107
children (53 M, 54 F) (initial average age
9.1 Æ 0.5 years) completed all six longitu-
dinal measurements and were selected for
the analysis. The study participants were in
the third grade at primary school at the
baseline and in the eighth grade at the last
follow-up.
Research design and measures
The 5-year longitudinal research study was
performed once per school year, from 2001
to 2006. Each session included cross-
sectional (single point), quantitative meas-
urements of anthropometric characteristics,
contractile properties of skeletal muscles,
and running speed.
During the study, six repeat measure-
ments were performed from the third to
eighth grades of the children's primary
school education. The same procedure was
used at each measurement. Because all
major physical or sport activities were
discouraged before each measurement
(approximately 2 days), the research team
informed each school of the exact date on
which each stage of the study was to be
implemented at least 1 week before it
occurred.
Measurements of skeletal muscle
contractile properties
TMG measuring method. TMG is a method for
measuring skeletal muscles' contractile
properties.10 It determines the muscle's
mechanical responses based on radial
muscle belly displacement induced by a
single electrical stimulus.12 TMG is imple-
mented mostly by a TMG S1 system (TMG
Science for Body Evaluation). The method
was first introduced as a measuring tech-
nique and was then proposed as a method
for defining parameters. Later, the link
between the amplitude of the mechanical
TMG response and the relative muscle force
was introduced--which is a linear relation.7
The TMG method was then evaluated for
these uses, and its validity was proven in
several studies, including long-term
stability.13­16
Two muscles, VL and BF (leg-dominant
sites), were chosen for the measurements,
which are shown in Table 1. We used a single
1-msec pulse, applied through the cathode
and anode, to elicit a twitch contraction.
The stimulation current at the start was just
above the contraction threshold and was
increased gradually until the response amp-
litude ceased to increase. Two maximum
twitch responses were recorded and saved.
The maximum displacement amplitude
and contraction times were calculated from
each twitch response.5,7 Maximum displace-
ment amplitude (in millimeters) was
defined as the peak amplitude on the
234 Journal of International Medical Research 45(1)
displacementÀtime curve of the TMG
twitch response. The contraction time (in
milliseconds) was the time from 10% to 90%
of the maximum displacement amplitude.17
The average value of these parameters
extracted from two twitch responses was
used for further analysis. Various experts
from the fields of electrical engineering and
computer science, physical education tea-
chers, and undergraduate sport sciences
students performed the measurements. A
medical doctor supervised all measurements.
Measurement of running speed
Before measuring maximum running speed,
all participants were ``warmed up'' appro-
priately for approximately 20 minutes.
The warm-up process was composed of
the following.
­ Running (5 minutes)
­ Stretching (5 minutes)
­ Warm-up running practice (10 minutes)
Each participant's warm-up followed the
same procedure and was led by the same
person. Each participant completed two
experimental sprints. We measured max-
imum running speed at a distance of 7 m
from a flying start that was 10 m long. The
participants performed preliminary runs
during the measurement process, followed
by the first photocell checkpoint, and after
7 m the second photocell checkpoint. We
divided the running distance into 7-m seg-
ments and identified a position from which
we could calculate the sprint speed. Each
participant repeated the sprint twice, and the
better result was used for further analysis.
Maximum running speed was measured
using a wireless Brower measurement
system (Brower Timing Systems, Draper,
UT, USA).
Data analysis
Six sets of measurements were obtained for
each participant. A set consisted of the
Table 1. Measurements of vastus lateralis and biceps femoris muscles.
Position of measurement
Vastus lateralis: Measurements on the VL were performed in the supine position at 30 knee flexion,
where 0 represents the extended joint.
Biceps femoris: Measurements on the BF were performed in the prone position at 5 knee flexion.
Procedure
1. Place the muscle to be measured in a relaxed, predefined position and evoke muscle contraction by
applying a brief electrical stimulus.
2. Prepare a pair of self-adhesive stimulation Pals electrodes (50 mm diameter) (AxelGaard, Fallbrook, CA,
USA).
3. Measure the muscle in a bipolar way in that the negative electrode (cathode) is installed 5 cm distal and
the positive electrode (anode) 5 cm proximal to the measurement point.
4. Select the measurement point where the belly muscle is largest while ensuring that the selected place is
between the two electrodes. Start the experimental measurements (with palpation and re-installation of
the electrodes and sensors if needed). Because each muscle has its own specific anatomical structure,
some adjustments may be needed regarding the locations of the measuring equipment.
a. Vastus lateralis: Set the sensor perpendicular to the skin overlying the muscle belly at 30% of the femur
length above the patella on the lateral side.
b. Biceps femoris: Set the sensor perpendicular to the skin overlying the muscle belly of the BF at the
midpoint of the line between the fibular head and the ischial tuberosity.

muscle contraction times for the VL and BF
together with the running speed. For the
analysis performed in the present study, we
were not interested in absolute changes in
muscle contraction times or running speed
during childhood development. We were
interested in the changes in the contraction
times and speed categories and the associ-
ation between these two entities. We used
the MCA18 to analyze the changes and
associations. MCA is a multivariate statis-
tical technique used to analyze multi-way
contingency tables that unveils some corres-
pondence between columns (variables) and
rows (category values). Its aims are similar
to those of principal component analysis,
but it uses categorical, rather than continu-
ous, data. MCA enables the user to associate
variables and their category values graphic-
ally. The MCA results are presented as ``bi-
plots.'' The proximity of category values in a
bi-plot presents the degree of association
between them (the closer the values, the
greater is the association). Each bi-plot can
be characterized by naming the dimensions,
which adds a qualitative viewpoint to the
analysis--one of the advantages of MCA.
The other notable advantage is the visual-
ization of many associations on a single
bi-plot, including associations between vari-
ables, associations between category values
of a single variable, and combinations of the
two. Thus, MCA might reveal more infor-
mation than, for example, correlation ana-
lysis or analysis of variance. A possible
weakness might be that the associations are
presented graphically and their magnitude
cannot be quantified exactly. We used IBM
SPSS Statistics 23 software (SPSS, Chicago,
IL, USA) to perform the MCA.
Each measured variable was discretized
prior to analysis. For the sake of the read-
ability of bi-plots, only four category values
were calculated for each transformed vari-
able. For running speed, we used very slow,
slow, fast, and very fast. For contraction
times, we used below average minus the
standard deviation (ÀSD), below average
(ÀAvg), above average (þAvg), and above
average plus the standard deviation (þSD).
Category values were obtained using SPSS
Visual Binning Automatic Transformation
(SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
The MCA of the VL contraction time and
running speed for boys (Figure 2) at six ages
showed that all running speed category
values formed their own clusters (i.e., very
slow, slow, fast, very fast), regardless of how
far away they were located from each other
or from both slow contraction time category
values. This clustering revealed the follow-
ing assumptions.
­ All running speed category values were
very different from each other, the most
different being the very slow speed cat-
egory value.
­ Neither of the slow running speed cat-
egory values was associated with VL
contraction times.
­ Boys' running speed category values
remained closely associated with each
other throughout the study, meaning
that boys who were very slow stayed
very slow, boys who were very fast stayed
very fast, and so on.
No structured associations could be
established between the fast speed running
category value and VL contraction times.
Additionally, the joint category plot shows
that the very fast speed category in 13-year-
old children is associated with below-
average VL contraction times at the ages
of 12 and 13 years (Figure 2).
A joint category plot for VL contraction
time and running speed for girls at six ages
(Figure 3) showed that all four running
speed category values formed their own
clusters that were located far away from
each other. Additionally, the very slow and
236 Journal of International Medical Research 45(1)
fast category values were located far away
from the VL contraction time category
values. This clustering revealed three
assumptions.
­ All running speed categories were very
different.
­ Running speed category values very slow
and fast were independent of VL con-
traction times.
­ Girls' running speed category values
stayed closely associated with each other
throughout the study, meaning that girls
who were very slow stayed very slow, girls
who were very fast stayed very fast, and
so on.
It is interesting to note that contraction
times labeled ­SD (contraction times: ­Avg
­SD) were also grouped in an isolated
cluster, meaning that extremely low contrac-
tion times did not have any effect on running
speed and that extremely low VL contrac-
tion times were categorically constant
throughout the study period. Low running
speed for girls was associated with under-
average VL contraction times and very fast
running speed with extremely high VL con-
traction times (þSD).
The MCA of BF contraction time and
running speed for boys at six ages showed
that all four running speed category values
formed clusters located far away from each

other, meaning that the four running speed
category values were not associated. As
above, the running speed category values
stayed constant: slow boys stayed slow and
fast boys stayed fast (Figure 4).
In contrast to the VL muscle, running
speed categories were associated with the BF
contraction time category values. These asso-
ciations can lead to the following conclusions.
­ Very slow and slow running speeds were
associated with very slow contraction
times, which were more than 1 SD from
the average BF contraction time.
­ Very fast running speeds were associated
with very fast contraction times, which
were less than 1 SD from the average BF
contraction time.
­ Fast running speed was associated with
below-average contraction times
The MCA of BF contraction time and
running speed for girls at six ages showed
that the extreme running speed category
values--very slow and very fast--formed
their own clusters located far away from
each other and far away from the BF
contraction time category values (Figure 5).
This clustering revealed three assumptions.
­ The extreme running speed category
values--very slow and very fast--were
very different from each other.
­ Neither extreme running speed category
value was associated with the BF con-
traction time.
Figure 3. Correspondence analysis of vastus lateralis and running speed for girls at six ages.
238 Journal of International Medical Research 45(1)
­ Girls who were very slow or very fast
remained very slow or very fast during all
6 years of the study.
­ The þSD muscle contraction times were
grouped in one cluster, meaning that
the highest contraction time category
value stayed constant throughout the
study.
Additionally, contraction times labeled
þSD (contraction times above average þ 1
SD) were grouped in an isolated cluster,
meaning that extremely high BF contraction
times had no effect on running speed. In
contrast, slow and fast running speed cat-
egory values were associated with
different BF contraction time categories.
Nevertheless, no clear association could be
established between running speeds and BF
contraction times.
The associations between contraction
time category values and running speed
category values in regard to gender and
muscle are summarized in Table 2. There are
some clear associations at specific category
values, in contrast to other category values,
where there seem to be no association
between speed and contraction times.
A comparison of the clustering of muscle
contraction time category values and that of
running speed category values shows that
the same running speed category values are
always grouped in one coherent cluster.
Thus, participants' categorical running

speed did not changed with age. In contrast,
muscle contraction time category values did
not form coherent clusters, meaning that
there were some categorical changes in
muscle contraction times associated with
the participants' ages.
Regarding gender, the running speed of
boys was less dependent on VL contraction

times than that of girls. This finding is in
contrast to that of the BF muscle, where
girls' BF contraction times had either no or
unstructured associations with running
speeds compared with those of boys, in
whom there were some clear associations.
Joint category plots showed that BF con-
traction times were associated more closely
with running speeds than were those of the
VL muscle. It is interesting that extremely
high contraction times (above average þ 1
SD) were not associated with running speeds
for the BF muscle, in contrast to the VL
muscle, where extremely low contraction
times (below average À 1SD) were not
associated with running speeds.
The dimensions
After examining the muscle contraction
speed category values and running speed
category values, all four bi-plots' dimensions
were named in an equal manner. The x-axis
represented the ``Running speed,'' and the
y-axis represented the ``Contraction time.''
The following general observations about
associations between contraction times and
running speed could be derived based on
these dimensions.
. VL muscle: The association is propor-
tional (higher contraction times result in
higher running speeds).
. BF muscle: The association is inversely
proportional (higher contraction times
result in slower running speeds).
Discussion
The analysis just described contributes a
new insight into children's skeletal muscle
development. We can summarize the results
by taking into consideration the research
questions posed earlier. In general, the
association of muscle contraction time and
running speed was established, although
clear associations exist only for specific
category values of the two variables. There
are gender differences in the association of
running speed and muscle contraction times.
It seems, however, that the associations in
boys have more structure that those in girls.
The structure of associations differs between
muscles as well as the type of association
(proportional for VL and inversely propor-
tional for BF).
Associations between muscle contraction
times and running speed
The aim of this longitudinal study was to
gain insight into the development of chil-
dren's skeletal muscles, focusing on the
associations between running speed and
muscle contraction times, and comparing
age- and gender-related differences. Our
analysis revealed the presence of an associ-
ation between muscle contraction times and
running speed. Loturco et al.19 discovered
similar associations in adults. Their study
confirmed that the TMG-derived velocity of
BF contraction--calculated from the ratio
between maximum radial displacement and
the sum of contraction time and delay
time--is associated with 20 -m and change-
of-direction sprint performances of elite
soccer players. Bell et al.20 showed that the
distribution patterns and ultrastructure of
skeletal muscles in children did not differ
from those in normal adult tissues. Hence,
the combined results of these two studies
support the outcomes of our research.
The period from ages 7­10 for girls and
7­12 for boys--called ``late childhood''--is
characterized by rapid linear growth of the
limbs. The next growth surge occurs during
adolescence and lasts for about 2 years, from
around ages 11­13 in girls and 12­14 in
boys. At this stage, some of the body's
dimensions rapidly increase. Our study,
however, showed that the running speed
category values generally did not change
during that period. Unfortunately, no other
Zavrs
nik et al. 241
similar published studies could be found.
The lack of comparable studies could be
because skeletal muscle composition is dif-
ficult to measure in healthy children. Some
studies have investigated VL composition in
adults, but there have been few studies on
children20 or adolescents.21
Gender differences
Our study showed that there were gender
differences in the association of running
speed and muscle contraction times, which
had been confirmed previously with correl-
ation analysis and published elsewhere.22
The analysis showed some gender differ-
ences in the VL muscle: (1) the contraction
time changes with age (faster in boys than in
girls); (2) maximum running speed of the
boys over the whole measurement period
increased, whereas for the girls it increased
only up to the seventh grade; (3) the con-
traction times of VL first declined until the
fourth grade and later increased (signifi-
cantly more in boys than in girls). These
accomplishments could be attributed to the
fact that the early school period is the most
important for the development of children's
motor potentials and for learning movement
patterns. Usually, children learn new move-
ment techniques quickly and with little
effort.23,24 As children develop coordin-
ation, they usually change the way they
run. From a technical point of view, boys
run more correctly, including their use of the
two-headed muscle of the thigh (BF).
Praprotnik et al.25 studied the correlation
between the BF muscle and the maximum
speeds of male sprinters. They found that
optimal running resulted from using a
proper technique and taking advantage of
the BF. It was also found that boys perform
better than girls in most tests of coordin-
ation.26 The myelination of the nervous
system is crucial for muscle responsiveness.
Additionally, significant differences in the
muscle contraction speed coincide with
``blast growth'' during middle and late
childhood and adolescence.27 S
 imunic

et al.28 showed that overall muscle mass is
13­17% greater in boys than in girls
between the ages of 8 and 13 years, which
could be an additional source of gender-
related differences in running speed.
According to Always et al.,29 women have
a smaller cross section of muscle fibers than
men, which could be why they have a shorter
contraction time. Contrary to the above
studies, some researchers claim that there
are no significant differences in the percent-
age of fiber types between genders.30,31
Muscle differences
We confirmed that the structure of associ-
ations, as well as the type of association
(proportional in VL and inversely propor-
tional in BF), differs between these muscles.
The VL muscle is an anti-gravitational
muscle and so receives many mechanical
stimuli for its adaptation (i.e., hypertrophy).
The BF is not an anti-gravitational muscle
and therefore has few everyday mechanical
stimuli. The two-headed thigh muscle (BF)
can be trained to a greater extent because it
contains the largest number of type IIc, or
satellite-based, fibers, which, depending on
the functional requirements of the body, can
be transformed into type I or type II fibers.
Limitations
Our study has some limitations. First is the
selection of the research environment: only
three of twelve Slovenian regions were
selected for the study. Second is the use of
a non-standardized measurement tool.
Because other studies on children's physical
activities already exist, it might have been
better to use some previously developed
measurement tools. Nonetheless, the meth-
ods used in the present study were quite
similar to those of other studies, so com-
parison may still be possible.

Conclusion
By using MCA of VL contraction time and
running speed for girls and boys, we were
able to show that running speed categories
are different in boys and girls. For boys, the
very slow speed category was the most
different. Also in boys, the slow and very
slow running speed categories were independ-
ent of VL contraction times, in contrast to
the situation in girls, for whom very slow and
fast running speed categories were independ-
ent of VL contraction times. Interestingly,
boys' running speed categories stayed con-
stant throughout the study, whereas only two
categories remained constant for girls (very
slow and fast). Our study also revealed that
boys' running speed was less dependent on
VL contraction times than that of girls.
The MCA of BF contraction time and
running speed for boys and girls revealed
that, in boys, contrary to what was observed
with the VL muscle, running speed cate-
gories were associated with BF contraction
time categories. In boys, fast and very fast
running speeds were associated with con-
traction times below ÀSD from the average
BF contraction time. In contrast, girls' fast
and very fast running speed categories were
very different and independent of BF con-
traction times. Our study also showed that
boys' running speed categories were much
more structurally associated with BF con-
traction times than those of girls.
Comparing the MCA results for the VL
and BF contraction times and running
speeds for boys and girls shows that the
BF contraction times were associated much
more closely with running speed than were
the VL contraction times. It was also found
out that extremely long contraction times
of the BF are not associated with
running speed, in contrast to the VL whose
extremely short contraction times are not
associated with running speed.
The present results provide insight into a
whole new dimension of a child's develop-
ment. We are confident that our assessment
of the contractile parameters in two skeletal
muscles, VL and BF, will contribute to the
general understanding of children's skeletal
muscle development. It is important to note
also the longitudinal nature of this study as
such studies are rare in our field of interest.
