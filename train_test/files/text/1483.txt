Abstract
Estimating the population distribution of the usual intake of a nutrient relative to that of another nutrient requires
determination of individual-level ratios. If intake data are available on a per-day basis, as with 24-h dietary recalls, those
ratios can be determined in 1 of 2 ways: as the usual ratio of intakes or the ratio of usual intakes. Each of these ratios has its
own meaning and determination; the ratio of usual intakes is conceptually consistent with determinations obtained from
FFQ data. We present a method for estimating the ratio of usual intakes that uses bivariate modeling of the 2 nutrient
intakes in question. Application of the method to the NHANES data for the years 2001­2004 yielded estimated
distributions for percent of usual energy intake from total fat, percent of usual energy intake from saturated fat, and usual
sodium intake per 1000 kcal (4184 kJ) of usual energy intake. Distributions for both the total population and for age-gender
subgroups were estimated. Approximately 60% of adults (.19 y) had a usual total fat intake that was within the
recommended range of 20­35% of total energy, but only ~34% had a usual saturated fat intake ,10% of total energy. The
results changed only minimally when the other definition of usual intake, the usual ratio of intakes, was adopted. J. Nutr.

Introduction
A major purpose of dietary surveillance or monitoring is to
evaluate dietary intakes relative to some standard. Standards
may be averages, around which the population's intakes should
be distributed, or thresholds, above or below which the
population's intake should fall, but they are all established
with regard to usual intake, generally defined as the long-run
average daily intake over a period of time (1,2). This is
important because diets vary considerably from day to day.
Nonetheless, the primary assessment method used in dietary
surveillance is the 24-h dietary recall (3), a method that
inherently captures intake one day at a time and thus yields a
large amount of within-person variation.
In previous work on estimating the proportions of the
population meeting recommended dietary intake levels, inves-
tigators have either presented the distributions of the reported
values (4) or have adjusted the variance of the distribution to
exclude within-person variation (5­8). Only the latter methods
successfully remove the within-person variation and produce
distributions of usual intake that have approximately the correct
spread or variance. However, these methods have heretofore
been available only for intakes of single dietary components that
are consumed nearly every day by nearly everyone [see Dodd
et al. (9) for a review].
In dietary surveillance, it is often of interest to examine the
population distribution of usual intake for a ratio of 2 dietary
components. Examples include the distribution of intakes of
saturated fat, total fat, or sodium, each expressed as a ratio of
total energy intake. Estimating such distributions from national
survey data that are based upon dietary intake reports from 24-h
recalls is not trivial.
It has been noted previously (10,11) that there are 2 ways of
describing the distribution of ratios of intakes. Likewise, 2
definitions of an individual's usual intake ratio are available.
First, one could take the long-term mean of the daily ratio of
intakes, which we will call the usual ratio (of intakes). Second,
one could take the ratio of the long-term means of the daily
intakes, which we will call the ratio of usual intakes. A simple
(but rather extreme) example shows that these are different.

Suppose that a person consumes on alternate days 10,000 kJ, of
which 4000 kJ are from fat, and 6000 kJ, of which only 600 kJ
are from fat. Using the usual ratio, the usual percent energy from
fat is the average of 40 and 10%, i.e. 25%. Using the ratio of
usual intakes, the usual fat intake is 2300 kJ, the usual energy
intake is 8000 kJ, and their ratio is 29%.
The question of which definition is the more appropriate for
purposes of dietary surveillance is not an easy matter to resolve,

because the decision may depend on biological knowledge that is
often lacking. The usual ratio is simpler to calculate, but the
ratio of usual intakes is conceptually consistent with the ratio
that would be determined from FFQ, because they query long-
term intake. For this reason alone, it is desirable to have a
statistical method for estimating the ratio of usual intakes and
deriving its distribution in the population from 24-h recall data.
Therefore, our purposes in this article are to describe the
methodology for estimating the population distribution of
the ratio of usual intakes and to apply the method to estimate
the distributions of several ratios. A feature of the method is the
ability to estimate distributions in subpopulations. Accordingly,
we also present distributions according to selected age and
gender groups. Finally, we compare the results of estimating the
population distribution of the ratio of usual intakes with those
for the usual ratio and shows that the difference was small in the
examples.
Methods
Data. The data for this study were obtained from 17,889 participants
in the 2001­2004 NHANES. All recalls obtained from individuals aged
$1 y were included except those deemed unreliable by survey staff (297
individuals), those reporting breast milk consumption (39 individuals)
because breast milk intake was not quantified, and 1 individual who
reported fasting on the survey day.
Dietary intakes were assessed via computer-assisted, interviewer-
administered 24-h recalls. In 2001, a single recall was requested from all
individuals. In 2003­2004, 2 recalls were requested of all participants.
The first dietary interview was conducted in a mobile examination center
and the second was conducted 3­10 d later via telephone.
The NHANES has a complex, multistage, probability design. For this
study, one of the authors (K.W.D.) created replicate weight sets suitable
for the balanced repeated replication method of variance estimation. The
replicate weights were based on the dietary survey weights accompany-
ing the NHANES data files, which adjust for survey design, nonresponse,
day of week, and any sequence effect in the second recall.
The NHANES 2001­2004 surveys were approved by the NHANES
Institutional Review Board under protocol no. 98­12. Further informa-
tion about the NHANES is available elsewhere (12).
Estimating the population distribution of the ratio of usual
intakes. The method, described briefly here, is based on a joint bivariate
model for the 2 nutrients (the numerator and the denominator of the
ratio) in question. A more precise and technical description is provided in
the Supplemental Appendix.
Each reported nutrient intake was first mathematically transformed
to approximate normality using a Box-Cox (power) transformation. The
transformation was chosen to minimize the mean squared error around a
straight line fit to a weighted QQ plot using the sampling survey weights
of each participant.
The data were then analyzed using a bivariate linear mixed effects
model, including the following terms for each nutrient: an intercept
(fixed effect), an indicator for whether the reported day was a weekday
or a weekend (fixed effect), an indicator for the sequence number (first
vs. second) of the report (fixed effect), indicators for age group (fixed
effects), a subject-specific term (random effect), and a within-subject
error term (random error). For the analysis of children's intakes, an extra
covariate for gender (fixed effect) was included. For adults, men and
women were analyzed separately.
The covariate weekday/weekend was included to accommodate the
difference in intake that often occurs between the weekend (Friday to
Sunday) and the rest of the week. The covariate sequence number was
included to accommodate the possibility that participants report less
fully on the second recall than on the first. The first recall was taken to be
the unbiased report.
The covariate age group, which is a factor with several levels, was
includedto allow estimation of the distributionwithin specific age groups.

Including a covariate in the model allows estimation of distributions in
subpopulations and results in much greater precision than analyzing the
model on only the subset of data from that subpopulation (13).
The subject-specific terms of the 2 nutrients were assumed to have a
bivariate normal distribution, with 2 variances and a covariance
estimated from the data. Likewise, the within-subject terms were
assumed to be bivariate normal and independent of the subject-specific
terms and required another 2 variances and a covariance to be estimated.
The model parameters could be estimated, because many participants
completed more than one 24-h recall. If there are no repeated
determinations, then within-subject variance parameters could not be
estimated. In the data from NHANES 2001­2004, 69% of the
participants completed 2 24-h recalls.
The model was fitted to the data using the NLMIXED procedure in
the statistical software package SAS and the sampling weights of each
participant were incorporated into the analysis. The output yielded
estimates of the fixed-effect and random-effect model parameters,
including the within-subject covariances. Three runs of the NLMIXED
procedure for each type of ratio were performed on children aged 1­8 y,
males aged $9 y, and females $9 y.
Monte Carlo simulations were then run using the parameter values
estimated from the model. These simulations generated usual intakes of each
nutrient for a large number of pseudo-individuals (the details of these
simulations are described in the Supplemental Appendix). The ratio of usual
intakes was calculated for each pseudo-individual and, using the sampling
weights, the percentiles of the distribution of ratios of usual intakes were
estimated. SE were estimated using balanced repeated replication.
These procedures were used to estimate distributions for 10 age-gender
subgroups. The distributions for men and women $19 y were estimated by
combining the distributions of 4 finer age groupings according to the
population proportion in each subgroup. Results are shown for the
following ratios: total fat:energy, saturated fat:energy, and sodium:energy.
Values in the text are means or proportions 6 1 SE, or estimated percentiles.
The SAS code for performing these analyses is available at http://riskfactor.
cancer.gov/diet/usualintakes/.
Estimating the population distribution of the usual ratio. The
method for estimating the population distribution of the usual ratio is
simpler than for the ratio of usual intakes, because it is based on the
univariate distribution of the ratio of daily intakes rather than on the
bivariate distribution of the numerator and denominator. Several
methods can be applied directly to individuals' 24-h recall reported
daily ratios (5,6,13) and would be expected to give very similar results.
For this report, the one-part version of a method developed at the
National Cancer Institute (13) was used.
Results
The estimated mean percentage of usual energy intake from total
fat in the total population was 33.6 6 0.2% and the median
33.3% (Table 1). The 5th and 95th percentiles were 25.1 and
42.9%, respectively. There was modest variation with age, with
older persons tending to have a higher percentage intake and
very little difference between men and women.
The estimated mean percentage of usual energy intake from
saturated fat in the total population was 11.2 6 0.1% and the
median 11.0% (Table 2). The 5th and 95th percentiles were 7.8
and 15.0%, respectively. The youngest children (1­3 y) had the
highest percentage; the percentage was lower in children aged
4­18 y and lowest in adults . 19 y, with little variation among
adults by age group or between men and women.
The estimated mean usual intake of sodium per 1000 kcal
(4184 kJ) of usual energy intake in the total population was
1554 6 7 mg and the median was 1538 mg (Table 3). Intakes
were lower among young children (1­3 y). Intakes were also
slightly lower among younger adults (31­50 y) than older adults
(.50 y). Differences between men and women were minor.

estimates for these ratios and the estimated distributions for
other ratios are available.7
The methodology described also allows estimation of the
proportion of the population whose ratio of usual intakes
falls within a chosen interval. An estimated 62 6 1% of the
population had a usual total fat consumption that was within
the acceptable macronutrient distribution range for total fat
(20­35% of energy) as set by the Institute of Medicine (14)
(Table 4). The proportion meeting this recommendation was
lowest in the 51- to 70-y age group, where only 52 6 2% did so.
Approximately 34% of the adult population's usual saturated
fat consumption was ,10% of energy, as recommended by
the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2). The proportion of
children meeting that recommendation was smaller.
The difference between the estimated distribution of the ratio
of usual intakes and the distribution of the usual ratio of intakes
for the same 3 ratios was small (Tables 5­7). The differences
were in both directions but very small compared with the
quantity estimated. All differences were ,3% of the estimated
value.
Discussion
The method described in this article has provided for the first
time, to our knowledge, estimates of the distribution of ratios
of usual intakes of nutrients to usual energy intake for the U.
S. population and age-gender subgroups. Ratios give more
direct information on the quality of the composition of the
diet consumed than is provided by absolute intakes of
nutrients and distributions of such ratios have heretofore
been unavailable.
For the 3 examples given, differences between men and
women were minor. Thus, although absolute intakes of these
nutrients differed substantially between men and women, after
adjustment for energy intake, the intakes were very similar.
Because there are 2 different definitions of usual intake of a
ratio, investigators may ask which to use and whether it matters
which is used. The following formula provides the investigator
with a method of judging whether the 2 definitions will lead
to similar results. Denote an individual's ratio on a given day
by x/y. If CVy
is the within-person CV of the denominator
(expressed as a proportion, not as a percentage) and CVx
is that
of the numerator, and if rxy
is the within-person correlation
between the numerator and denominator, then:
individual0s usual ratio ffi ð1 þ CV2
y
2rxy
CVx
CVy
Þ
3 individual0s ratio of usual intakes:
This approximate result is obtained using Taylor's expansion
and should provide reasonable accuracy for CV ,0.75. It is
similar to and mathematically consistent with the expression
given by Krebs-Smith et al. (10), although those authors were
concerned with ratios at the population level rather than at the
individual level. The closer the bracketed expression is to 1.0,
the closer the usual ratio will be to the ratio of usual intakes and,
consequently, the closer the 2 methods of estimating the
population distribution of usual intake will be for the ratio of
nutrients in question. Data from repeat 24-h recalls in the Eating
at America's Table Study (15) indicate that the within-person
CV for energy is ~0.32, for saturated fat is 0.37, and for sodium
0.43 [Supplemental Table 1 in (11)]. The within-person corre-
lations with energy were 0.78 for saturated fat and 0.71 for

sodium [Supplemental Table 1 in (11)]. Thus, the bracketed
expression above for the saturated fat:energy ratio is equal to
1.010 and for the sodium:energy ratio is 1.004, values that are
close enough to 1 that one would expect very little difference
between the methods. That the values are so close to 1 is due to
the relatively high correlation between numerator and denom-
inator, together with the similarity in their CV.
As predicted by the above formula, the results presented in
Tables 6 and 7 show very little difference between the 2
methods for the saturated fat:energy ratio and the sodium:
energy ratio. Table 5 shows that the difference was also small
for the total fat:energy ratio. The formula predicts, however,
that differences could be more important in other situations.
For example, in a case where the denominator has a high CV
and the numerator has little or no correlation with the
denominator, one might expect larger differences. Thus, ratios
of micronutrients, such as vitamin C, to energy may display
larger differences.
In view of the possibility of larger differences being found
between the 2 methods, it would seem appropriate to identify if
and when one of the definitions is more appropriate. As
mentioned in the Introduction, this choice is difficult in the
absence of relevant biological information. For example, high
intakes of saturated fat are considered deleterious and it is
recommended that Americans consume ,10% of energy from
such fatty acids. What is less clear is whether this ratio of 10% of
energy should not be exceeded on a diurnal basis or over time. If
each day's ratio has some relevance, then the usual ratio may be
more appropriate. If, however, the relevant ratio is the propor-
tion of all energy consumed over a long period of time derived
from saturated fat, then the ratio of usual intakes may be more
appropriate. For most ratios of interest in nutrition, biological
information to guide choosing the most relevant ratio is not yet
available. It may be that one or the other method will be found to
be more appropriate for some ratios than others. Most nutri-
tionists we have questioned have stated a preference for the ratio
of usual intakes, perhaps reflecting an intuition that this term
better reflects the steady state of an individual. As mentioned
earlier, the ratio of usual intakes has the added advantage of being
conceptually consistent with determinations based on food
frequency data.
The method described can be applied to data gathered by
repeated 24-h recalls on nutrients or other dietary constituents
that are consumed nearly every day by nearly everyone in the
population. The method is intended for use on quite large
datasets with sample sizes of at least 1000 or more, especially if
distributions in population subgroups are to be estimated. If one
is interested in the distribution of a total population only, then a
sample of several hundred may suffice.
On occasion there is a need to examine the population
distribution of the ratio of an episodically consumed food or
nutrient (one that is not typically consumed every day) to
another food or energy. For example, one may be interested in
cholesterol intake from eggs as a proportion of total cholesterol
intake. In such cases, the required statistical modeling becomes
more complex. Methods using an extension of the 2-part model
described by Kipnis et al. (16) are now being developed to allow
the estimation of these types of distributions.
