Abstract
Objective: This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology and changes in antibacterial
susceptibility of children in Shenmu City, northern Shaanxi, and provide a basis for rational
drug use.
Methods: The distribution and drug resistance pattern of pathogenic bacteria isolated from
children were retrospectively analysed.
Results: A total of 573 strains of pathogens were cultivated. A total of 201 (35.07%)
strains of Gram-positive cocci and 183 (31.93%) strains of Gram-negative cocci were detected.
A total of 189 (32.98%) strains of fungi were detected. The resistance rate of Staphylococcus
to penicillin was 100% and that to erythromycin was 90.69%. There were varying degrees
of resistance to other drugs, but no single strain had vancomycin resistance. Gram-negative bacilli
were generally resistant to ampicillin, but had low resistance to the combined preparation
of enzyme inhibitors, quinolones, and aminoglycosides, and were highly sensitive to imipenem
and meropenem.
Conclusion: Gram-negative bacilli are the main pathogens of bacterial infection in the paediatric
ward. Strengthening clinical monitoring of bacterial distribution in paediatric clinical isolates and
understanding changes in drug resistance are important for guiding the rational use of antibiotics.
These measures could also prevent emergence and spreading of resistant strains.

Introduction
Antimicrobial resistance is the ability of a
microorganism (e.g., bacteria, viruses, and
some parasites) to stop an antimicrobial (e.g.,
antibiotics, antivirals, and antimalarials)
from working against it. As a result, standard
treatments become ineffective, infections per-
sist, and infections may become severe and
can also spread to others.1 Antimicrobial
resistance is an internationally documented
threat to health.2 Bacterial infections that are
resistant to antibiotics can limit the availabil-
ity of effective treatment options, rendering
some commonly encountered bacterial infec-
tions challenging to treat.3 Antibiotic-
resistant infections are also twice as likely to
be associated with greater morbidity and
mortality and are associated with increased
healthcare costs.4 Antibiotics are a keystone
for treating bacterial infections and children
receive these drugs more frequently than any
other class of medication. However, inappro-
priate and unnecessary use of antibiotics
in the past decades has increased the emer-
gence of resistant bacterial strains.5 Children
receive a lot of primary healthcare services,
and as such, receive an excessively high
number of antibiotics compared with
middle-aged populations.6 Children are also
major drivers of infection within commu-
nities and can contribute to the spread of
bacteria from person to person.7 Nearly 80%
of childhood cases of urinary tract infection
in poorer countries are resistant to amoxicil-
lin, and 60% are resistant to co-amoxiclav.
More than a quarter of children are resistant
to ciprofloxacin (Cipro), and 17% to nitro-
furantoin.8 All of the above-mentioned
factors require clinicians to be responsible
for a correct diagnosis and treatment for
affected children as soon as possible to avoid
unnecessary disability and death. Despite
this, little research has been published
describing the microbial spectrum and anti-
microbial resistance profile of bacteria from
paediatric patients in China. Therefore, an
understanding of the pathogens and anti-
biotic resistance associated with paediatric
infections at our hospital and in nearby
regions is necessary. In this study, we
selected clinical data from patients who
were admitted to the Paediatric Department
during January 2011 to December 2015 for
retrospective analysis of the distribution of
bacterial species and changes in drug resist-
ance. This study aimed to determine the
profile and susceptibility patterns of bacterial
pathogens associated with infections in
paediatric patients during 5 years.
Materials and methods
Source of strains
Pathogens were isolated from specimens
that were collected from all children who
were admitted to Shenmu Hospital during
January 2011 to December 2015. A total of
573 strains were isolated from 419 male
patients and 154 female patients.
Ethics statement
Non-routine procedures were used, and
only data regarding the results from culture
and sensitivity of specimens were analysed
retrospectively. Therefore, no consent was
required from the patients' caregivers.

Bacteriological identification
Isolation and culture of bacteria were car-
ried out according to the ``National Clinical
Practice Guidelines''.9 Bacteria were identi-
fied by the automatic bacteria analyser
VITEK - 2 identification system and a
manual method.
Drug sensitivity test
The fully automatic bacterial identifica-
tion instrument VITEK - 2 MIC and the
K-B (Kirby Bauer) Paper Slice diffusion
method were used to test drug sensitivity.
Antimicrobial impregnated absorbent paper
discs were provided by Oxoid Company
(UK) and Kangtai Company (China). Test
methods and criteria were performed
according to the latest standards of the
American CLSI (Clinical & Laboratory
Standards Institute) Standards.10 The
choice of antimicrobials was as follows:
penicillin (10 U), ampicillin (10 mg), pipera-
cillin (100 mg), oxacillin (1 mg), ampicillin/
sulbactam (10 mg/10 mg), amoxicillin
(20 mg/10 mg), cefoperazone/sulbactam
(75 mg/30mg), cefazolin (30 mg), cefuroxime
(30 mg), cefotaxime (30 mg), amikacin
(30 mg), gentamicin (10 mg), a high concen-
tration of gentamicin (120 mg), ciprofloxacin
(5 mg), vancomycin (30 mg), erythromycin
(15 mg), clindamycin (15 mg), meropenem
(10 mg), imipenem (10 mg), sulfamethoxa-
zole/trimethoprim (1.25 mg/23.75 mg), and
aztreonam (30 mg). Mueller­Hinton
medium was used for drug sensitivity tests.
M-H agar, supplemented with 5% defibri-
nated sheep blood, was used for determining
sensitivities of Streptococcus pneumoniae,
Streptococcus pyogenes and other strepto-
coccus spp. Haemophilus spp. were used to
supplement the basic medium for culture
of Haemophilus influenzae. The above-
mentioned antimicrobial sensitivity paper
discs and culture medium were provided by
Oxoid and Kang Tai Companies.
Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase strains
were confirmed by the double-disc method.
The antimicrobials used were cefotaxime/
clavulanic acid (30mg/10mg) and ceftazidime/
clavulanic acid (30mg/10mg), both provided
by Oxoid Company.
Quality control strains
Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Staphylococcus
aureus ATCC29213, and Pseudomonas aeru-
ginosa ATCC27853 were purchased from the
Shaanxi Provincial Clinical Laboratory.
Statistical analysis
VITEK - 2 identification system software
was used for analysis and processing of
all of the original test data. IBM Statistics
SPSS 21 Premium (Chicago, IL, USA) and
GraphPad Prism 6 (La Jolla, CA, USA)
statistical analysis software were used for the
statistical analysis.
Results
Distribution of specimens and strains
During January 2011 to December 2015, 573
strains of pathogens were isolated from
73.2% (419) male patients and 26.8% (154)
female patients. The Fisher­Irwin test
showed a significant difference in the
number of isolated strains between sexes
(2 ¼ 246.514, P < 0.0001). When we divided
the time period into three quantum zones,
spanning 20 months each, we found that the
portion of male children steadily increased
over time (Kruskal­Wallis 2 ¼ 25.20,
P < 0.01). A total of 73 (12.8%) children
were aged less than 28 days, 254 (44.4%)
were between 29 days and 1 year, 124
(21.6%) were between 1 and 3 years, 67
(11.7%) were between 3 and 6 years, and 55
(9.6%) were older than 6 years. The average
length of stay in hospital was 6 days and the
mean Æ standard deviation was 7.8 Æ 4.0
days (Table 1).

The distribution of pathogens included
285 respiratory specimens, 68 blood speci-
mens, 26 cerebrospinal fluid specimens,
24 urine specimens, and 11 faecal specimens
(Table 2). A total of 201 (35.07%) strains
of Gram-positive cocci and 183 (31.93 %)
strains of Gram-negative cocci were
detected. The main five bacteria were
Escherichia coli (9.94%), Klebsiella pneumo-
niae (7.32%), coagulase-negative staphylo-
cocci (9.94%), Staphylococcus aureus
(2.79%), and Enterobacter cloacae (2.79%).
A total of 189 (32.98%) strains of fungi were
detected. A significantly higher number of
pathogens were isolated from respiratory
secretion and blood compared with other
types of secretions. The yearly (2011­2015)
distribution ratio of pathogens is shown in
Table 3. The distribution of pathogens
according to variety of specimens is shown
in Table 4.
Drug-resistant rate
Among common Gram-positive bacteria,
16 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and
27 strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus
were isolated. The average resistance rate of
Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus
haemolyticus against penicillin was 100%.
Among macrolides, the resistance rate of
erythromycin was >80%, but no vancomy-
cin-resistant staphylococci were found
(Table 5). Among Gram-negative bacilli,
the Escherichia coli resistance rate for ampi-
cillin and piperacillin was >80% while its
resistance rate against first, second, third,
and fourth generation cephalosporins was
nearly 70%. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa
resistance rate to ampicillin was 100%.

Additionally, except for the low resistance
rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa against
the third generation cephalosporin ceftazi-
dime and fourth generation cephalosporin
cefepime, its resistance rate was higher than
90% against all other cephalosporins. The
resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to
levofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin, imi-
penem, and meropenem was <10%, while
its resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam was
30%. Escherichia coli was not resistant to

Discussion
Shenmu City coal mining has resulted in ser-
ious smoky air pollution, rendering the air
quality poor. This has caused an enormous
increase in infections of the respiratory tract
in hospitalized children.11 Thereis anupward
trend of yearly detection of pathogens, but
the overall number of pathogens that are
detected annually has decreased.12
Our study showed that the main patho-
gens of paediatric infection were Gram-
positive bacteria, accounting for 35.07%,
while Gram-negative bacteria accounted for
31.93% and fungi accounted for 32.98%.
These numbers of infected pathogens are
consistent with most domestic reports.13
The predominance of Gram-negative bac-
teria in hospital-acquired infections is prob-
ably due to the fact that patients are treated
with antimicrobial agents before admission.
Additionally, many individual clinics do
not perform allergy tests, and thus use
macrolides of which the main antimicrobial
spectrum is of Gram-positive bacteria.14
This results in a low detection rate of
Gram-positive bacteria, while Gram-
negative bacteria have become predominant
in examinations of pathogens in hospitalized

patients. Our study showed that detection of
coagulase-negative staphylococci infection
was highest among all hospital infections
and its detection rate was much higher than
that of other bacteria. This finding is
in accordance with previous studies.15 The
pathogenicity of coagulase-negative staphy-
lococci is less than that of Staphylococcus
aureus. However, in the case of immuno-
compromised patients, infection may still
occur, especially an increasingly growing
resistance of these strains (e.g., methicillin-
resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci),
suggesting that coagulase-negative staphy-
lococci is an important nosocomial infection
pathogen.16 Monitoring in children shows
that 33.33% of Streptococcus pneumoniae
is resistant to penicillin, while 100% of
Streptococcus pneumoniae is sensitive to
vancomycin and rifampicin, which has
important implications for treating penicil-
lin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Our 5-year study of paediatric infections
also showed that the main five Gram-
negative bacteria were Escherichia coli,
Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae,
Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. This finding is consistent with
the international literature.17,18 Among
Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus hae-
molyticus is the most common, followed by
Staphylococcus aureus.19 Fungal infection
also affects a large proportion of children,
with the main cause being Candida albicans.
Common Gram-negative bacilli show gen-
eral resistance against ampicillin and

adverse reactions in children, their use in
children is already limited.20 Our study

aeruginosa was 100% sensitive to ceftazi-
dime, cefepime, amikacin, fluoroquinolone,
and aztreonam. Enterobacter cloacae was
also highly sensitive to fluoroquinolones,
cefoperazone/sulbactam, cefotaxime, and
amikacin. The resistance of Gram-negative
bacilli to imipenem and meropenem is lower
in Shenmu City than that of other regions in
China,21 which may be related to the strict
control of antimicrobial drug use in our
hospital.
Overall, the situation in Shenmu City
regarding resistant paediatric pathogens is
serious. There is an urgent need to strengthen
monitoring of the distribution of pathogens
and bacterial resistance. Strict implementa-
tion of antimicrobial management, and good
use of consultation and an approval system
resulting in the rational use of antibiotics are
also required. At the same time, food and
drug supervision agencies and health admin-
istrative departments should strengthen
supervision of antimicrobial drug purchase
and strictly supervise prescription drugs,
especially in private clinics and drug retail
outlets. Publicity on antibacterial drug health
education should be increased through print
and social media to avoid pre-hospital, non-
prescription, irrational use of antibiotics. In
short, prevention and control of bacterial
drug resistance in standard paediatric treat-
ment is an important task.
