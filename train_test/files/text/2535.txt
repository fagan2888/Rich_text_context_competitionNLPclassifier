Measuring Green Productivity Growth for
China's Manufacturing Sectors: 1991­2000*
Jing Cao
Received 4 October 2006; Accepted 23 July 2007
Over the past two decades, China has sustained rapid economic growth of 8­
10 percent, part of which is attributed to the positive total factor productivity
(TFP) growth. However, this extraordinary economic performance has been
accompanied by severe environmental pollution and associated health damage.
The conventional TFP method is biased in interpreting the progress of technology
change because it does not consider non-marketable residues, such as environ-
mental pollution, and, hence, efficiency improvements in terms of pollution
abatement technology and environmentally friendly management are ignored.
This bias might direct our attention to less efficient use of environmental friendly
abatement technologies or send wrong signals to policy-makers. To address this
issue, the present paper applies a modified welfare-based green TFP approach,
treating environmental damage as non-desirable (negative) residual output.
Therefore, environmental efficiency is taken into account to accurately interpret
technological progress from a social welfare point of view. Based on a national
time-series input­output table, historical capital and labor input data for China
and sectoral level air pollution emission data from 1991 to 2000, the empirical
results suggest that with increasingly stringent environmental regulations, many
pollution intensive sectors, such as electricity, primary metal and chemical
industries, improved their environmental efficiency in the late 1990s. However,
because of the weak environmental regulations in construction and transportation,
and in sectors primarily composed of small private or township and village
industrial enterprises, firms within these industries contributed to increasing
environmental degradation.
Keywords: total factor productivity, green productivity growth, environmental
pollution, technology change.

I. Introduction
China's rapid economic growth in the 1990s, which averaged between 8 and
10 percent per annum, has attracted worldwide attention (NBS, 2003). Many
productivity growth studies have attributed this rapid growth rate to the growth
of total factor productivity (TFP) in China. Yeh (2004) estimates that China's
TFP growth was 3.7 between 1978 and 1995, which accounts for 40 percent of
GDP growth in China. Kaneko and Managi (2004) calculated that China's
overall TFP was approximately 4.9 percent between 1987 and 2001, and Ho and
Jorgenson (2001) estimated China's overall TFP to be between 0.6 and 2.2
between 1981 and 1995. However, these TFP studies only measure the improve-
ment in terms of economic efficiency in conventional outputs and inputs, such
as capital, labor and intermediate inputs, for which the quantity and prices can
be directly observed from the market.
With rapid economic growth, China's energy use and environmental pollution
have increased significantly, and the environmental quality in China has continued
to deteriorate. Based on estimates by the World Bank (1997) and Ho and Jorgenson
(2007), in 1997, total environmental damage accounted for approximately
2­8 percent of total GDP. Therefore, because they do not consider undesirable
non-market outputs, such as environmental pollution, conventional TFP studies
are seriously misleading in explaining true technology changes in terms of both
production efficiency and environmental efficiency from the social point of view.
In the late 1990s, the Chinese Government started to implement a series of
environmental regulations, including direct command and control in pollution
abatement technologies, national emission control standards and pollution levy
systems on both particulate matters and sulfur dioxide. These policies have been
particularly implemented in pollution intensive sectors, such as the electricity,
the primary metal and the chemical sector. With the gradual stringency of environ-
mental regulation, firms have been diverting more resources to pollution treatment
to meet the environmental standards. Therefore, even if there is slow TFP growth
in terms of conventional inputs or outputs, as long as R&D improves environmental
quality or environmental efficiency, from the perspective of sustainable development
an improvement is still achieved in terms of true technological progress. In
contrast, for some rising markets with increasing demands, such as construction
and transportation industries, the conventional TFP approach might overestimate
true productivity growth by ignoring the rapidly increasing pollution emissions
and associated environmental damage cause by these industries.
Let us do a simple thought experiment to consider this issue. Suppose that
firms have multiple ways of producing the same amount of output with the same
quality; one is to use a conventional pollution-intensive production technology
with less factor inputs such as capital and labor, and the other involves green
production but requires more of other factor inputs. The conventional TFP
approach suggests that the cheaper pollution intensive technology has higher
productivity using less conventional inputs, whereas the green production with
GREEN PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH IN CHINA 427

more resources allocated to pollution abatement would imply low productivity
growth. Undoubtedly, this reflects the traditional view that environmental
regulations negatively impact productivity growth. However, neoclassical
economic theory also asserts that what really matters is not how much in goods
is produced in society, but the available welfare level where consumers optimize
their consumption choices given the resource constraints. In the conventional
TFP framework, without considering the dimension of consumption on environ-
mental quality, the optimal condition that requires the productivity frontier to
be tangent with the utility curve would lead to a misleading efficiency point.
The conventional approach does not take into account the substitution between
commodity consumption and environmental quality.
Therefore, the conventional approach does not provide a reliable indicator of
overall economic efficiency, because it only captures the loss in factor costs as
a result of stricter environmental regulations but ignores the gains in environmental
benefits. More importantly, this biased measurement will inevitably direct our
attention to less efficient use of environmentally friendly abatement technologies
and instill a bias to government policies.
In sum, if one wants to measure how rapidly changes in technology progress,
in terms of both commodity production and environmental efficiency from a
social welfare point of view, the conventional TFP index needs to be extended
to a green TFP index framework. The latter method not only considers conven-
tional inputs, such as labor, capital, intermediate energy and non-energy inputs,
but also incorporates the non-market value of environmental costs. Therefore,
this method can be used to investigate real productivity growth and technology
changes from the perspective of sustainable development.
The paper proceeds as follows. In Section II, a summary of the published
literature on empirical TFP estimates in China, recent developments in the
methodology of green TFP accounting, and applications in the developed countries
is presented. Section III provides a detail explanation of how to construct the
index on sectoral output, capital, labor and intermediate inputs, as well as
quantifying the aggregate price and quantity index of environmental health
damage. In Section IV
, the flaws in the conventional TFP methodology framework
are discussed and a new framework for calculating green TFP is presented.
Empirical estimates of green TFP for China's manufacturing sectors are given
in Section V, and Section VI concludes the paper.
II. Literature Review
Economic theory to measure a society's productivity growth was developed
more than half a century ago. The notion of efficiency or productivity change as
a measure of change in economic efficiency was first introduced in Stigler's
1947 paper. Following Stigler, studies were conducted by Solow (1957), Dennison
(1962) and Kendrick (1961). The definitive work by Jorgenson and Griliches
(1967) shifted the literature's focus from labor productivity to TFP, which measures
ASIAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL 428

how well a society uses its scarce resources. Over the past 50 years, a tremendous
amount of literature has contributed to the intellectual development of TFP
measurement, including Jorgenson et al. (1987) and Gordon (1987).
There have been many conventional TFP measurement studies in China, at
both the aggregate level and at detailed census and survey data level, in particular
for the period after the economic reform of 1978. Young (2000) estimates the
TFP growth of the non-agriculture sector to be only 1.4 percent per year. Ho
and Jorgenson (2001) used the gross output data from a time-series input­output
table, rather than value-added data alone, and measured the sectoral TFP and
calculated the aggregate for China. Their results suggest that for the sample
period of 1981­1995, the agriculture sector showed substantial productivity
growth; in the manufacturing sector, some industries exhibited positive pro-
ductivity gains whereas others experienced negative productivity growth. Ren
and Sun (2005) constructed a more recent time series input­output table with
data from 1981 to 2000, and calculated the TFP growth of all two-digit level
sectors. They then calculated the Domar-weighted aggregate at the national level
for four sub-periods. Their study shows that, first, there was a fast TFP growth
from 1981 to 1984, followed by steady TFP growth at 3.14 and 3.83 percent
from 1984 to 1988 and from 1988 to 1994, respectively, and, finally, very slow
TFP growth of only 0.52 percent from 1994 to 2000. Jefferson et al. (2000) and
Woo et al. (1994) investigated productivity growth with different ownership
structures using detailed survey data rather than economic aggregate data, and
found that collective-owned enterprises have higher TFP growth than state-
owned enterprises (SOE) or other ownership enterprises; results for TFP growth
in SOE are inconclusive, with both positive and negative effects. Zhang et al.
(2001) conducted similar research, and suggested that foreign owned enterprises
have the highest efficiency score and that SOE have the lowest. Although
measuring TFP at both macro and micro levels has been extensively studied,
current TFP literature only takes into account the market output, while leaving
out the non-market part of the production process: environmental damages.
Green accounting, particularly green GDP, has become an important topic
attracting attention from both academia and government policy-makers. It is widely
accepted that the conventional national GDP account needs to be adjusted to
account for the degradation of both environmental and natural resources. The
State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) and the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS) have already formed working groups for calculating green
GDP. There have also been some trial estimations of China's green GDP. For
example, Lei (2001, 2002, 2005) suggests that about 3­7 percent of GDP in the
1990s was actually achieved at the cost of the degradation of natural resources
and the environment. He also points out that from a sustainable development point
of view, 40­60 percent of annual GDP growth should be deducted to compensate
for environmental degradation. However, Lei only calculates the green GDP for
1992, by constructing an environmental accounting extension of the official
1992 input­output (IO) table, which only gives a value term for the static quo

of a single year 1992, rather than indicating the dynamic efficiency changes in
the whole Chinese economic system. Therefore, following a similar idea of green
accounting, the present paper extends the `green' concept to productivity.
Green GDP only measures the size of economic activities, whereas green TFP
aggregates over all sectors indicate the efficiency changes of `green' productivity
over time.
Currently, there are still very few studies considering how non-market
resources should be incorporated in a model of productivity growth. This is
partly due to the fact that the prices and quantities of those non-marketable
resources, such as changes in environmental quality or natural resource stocks,
are not readily available. In addition, the equivalence between the producer's
model and consumer's model are not reliable for calculating the weights
(Swinand, 1999). The first attempt was made by Repetto et al. (1996), who
point out that the conventional method of TFP accounting ignores environmental
damages. They revise the concept by augmenting the conventional output to
`total' output, which takes into account the emissions released from the production
process. However, the model in Repetto et al. is not derived from productivity
theory, and the input shares are still the same as those in the conventional TFP
framework. Because consumers face different marginal prices for an output
compared with producers, the equivalence link between the producers' and
consumers' model would be broken. Swinand (1999) further addresses this
issue, and extends the model in Repetto et al. to a welfare-based `total resource
productivity (TRP)' framework, which is applied to the agriculture sector in
USA, by estimating the marginal abatement cost of pesticide leaching in ground
water. In addition, the social price of clean water is determined. Although Swinand
corrects the price and weights in the paper by Repetto et al. and provides a
theoretical basis for the green TFP, he still uses pollutant emissions as the quantity
to measure the growth index of environmental damages. Therefore, Swinand's
paper ignores the complexity of the emissions' air dispersion process: people in
different geographic sites and exposed to varying conditions inhale different
dosages of pollutants. Hence, different environmental impacts are generated.
This paper follows Swinand's TRP approach, but revises Swinand's emission
index to create an environmental damage index; that is, an index of monetized
physical impact of pollution. In addition, this paper conducts an industry level
green TFP analysis for all the manufacturing sectors in China. Ideally, one
needs to quantify the time-series environmental damages of all the pollutants
and their various impacts on human health, crop productivity, forests, water
bodies, the ecosystem and physical infrastructure. However, many environmental
experts believe that air pollution damage to human health dominates other types
of environmental impacts. For example, based on a World Bank study, the total
pollution costs in China are approximately US$54bn a year, which includes
urban and indoor air pollution, lead exposure, water pollution, and acid rain on
crops, materials and the ecosystem (World Bank 1997). It is estimated that total
air pollution-induced health damages are the largest component of pollution

costs: making up approximately 80 percent of the total damages.1 Because of
data limitations, the present study only considers air pollution-induced health
damage in the green TFP framework.
III. Data
The present paper uses data from IO tables that were constructed from NBS raw
data by Professor Ren Ruoen and his group at Beihang University (Xu et al.,
2005). Time-series IO tables, in particular `Use' or `Activity' tables, which
consist of inter-industry sections (dimensioned 33 commodities by 33 commod-
ities), value-added row sections, and final demand sections, are used. The labor
input data used in the present study was constructed by Professor Yue Ximing in
Renmin University, based on the value estimates from the time-series IO tables
and data from the household survey of income distributions in China.2
The methodology used in this study to compile the output, capital, labor and
intermediate inputs closely follows that in Ho and Jorgenson (2001), Jorgenson
et al. (2005) and Jorgenson et al. (1987). The present paper provides a short
description of the method of calculating the price and quantity index of conventional
gross outputs and all inputs.
The environmental emission data in this study is primarily collected from the
Sinton Energy Databook (version 6) (Sinton et al., 2004). The environmental
damage valuation using the intake fraction method follows previous estimation
work in a computable general equilibrium model of the Chinese economy (Cao
et al., 2005; Ho and Jorgenson, 2007).
III.1 Measuring capital input
To construct an index of capital input for each industrial sector Kjt
, the present
paper uses the Divisia method to derive the capital aggregate over multiple
types of capital assets: structures, equipments and auto vehicles.

( j = 1, 2, . . . , 28; k = structure, equipment, auto vehicles).
1. Based on the World Bank's (1997) estimate, the willingness to pay valuation of urban air pollution-
induced health damages are US$32 343, indoor air pollution health damages are US$10 648, and
the total pollution costs are US$53 589.

The value shares are computed from data on capital stock and the rental price
of capital services for each sector, cross-classified by type-structure, equipment
and auto vehicle. The measurement of capital inputs is discussed in length by
Ren and Sun (2005).
III.2 Measuring labor input
The labor data on employment is compiled from the 1982, 1990 and 2000
Population Census and the 1987 and 1995 Sample Population Survey. Estimation
of a compensation matrix is derived from three rounds of household surveys of
income distribution, the China Household Income Project (CHIP) survey,
conducted by the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, the Asian Development Bank, and the Ford Foundation, with additional
support provided by the East Asian Institute at Columbia University.3 Yue et al.
(2005) provide a detailed discussion of the measurement of labor inputs. An index
of labor inputs is constructed for each sector Ljt
using the Divisia method to aggregate
various types of labor, which are cross-classified by sex, age and education.
, (2)
where
( j = 1, 2, . . . , 28; l = cross classification of sex, age, education).
III.3 Measuring output and intermediate input
A time-series IO table is used to construct indexes of sectoral outputs and
intermediate inputs. Note adjustments have been made to transform the old
1981 Material Product System form IO table to the System of National
Accounts form. All the time-series current price `Use' tables are based on four
benchmark-year tables: 1981, 1987, 1992 and 1997 (see Ren et al., 2005).
An index of intermediate inputs is constructed for each manufacturing sector
by assuming the aggregate sectoral energy and non-energy material intermediate
input {Ejt
Mjt
} can be expressed by a translog function of its component {Eiit
Mjit
}.
Similar to the capital and labor index calculation, Equation (3), provides the
growth index of energy and non-energy intermediate input:

III.4 Measuring environmental damage index
An important assumption made in the present paper is that the environmental
damages at the sectoral level are treated as undesired residual outputs or positive
inputs, so that they can be directly incorporated into the TFP measurement
framework, as other conventional capital, labor and intermediate inputs or outputs.
To derive the green TFP growth rate at the sectoral level, one needs to estimate
the value of environmental damages and construct the price and quantity
indexes for each sector.
Intake fraction method of estimating the time-series quantity of health effects
To estimate time-series health damages to calculate the price and quantity of
environmental damage indeces, this paper applies the intake fraction (iF)
method to calculate health effects from the historical emissions of TSP, SO2
and NOx for each individual sector. Recall that total emissions are collected
from Sinton et al. (2004), and are made up of combustion emissions and non-
combustion (process) emissions.
, (4)
where x = TSP, SO2
, NOx, j = sector 1, 2, 3, . . . , 28, EMjxt
is the annual emissions
of pollutant x (in kilotons), and the C and NC superscripts denote combustion
and non-combustion, respectively.
In the environmental health literature, the intake fraction (IF) is defined as
`the integrated incremental intake of a pollutant released from a source or source
category (such as mobile sources or power plants), summed over all exposed
individuals during a given exposure time, per unit of emitted pollutant' (Ho and
Jorgenson, 2007, pp. 293). The intake fraction of pollutant x from source r is
defined as:

where Cxd
is the change in concentration at location d as a result of emissions
EMXY
, POPd
is the population at d, and BR is the breathing rate (Ho and Jorgenson,
2007). The industrial iF index (50 km) in China has been calculated from the
atmospheric dispersion models for the monitoring region in five sample urban
areas for various sectors (Wang et al., 2007). Following similar adjustments in
Ho and Jorgenson (2007), the iF parameter for the whole of China is scaled by
multiplying the 50 km local sample iF parameter by a factor of three. Therefore,
a time-series iF parameter index at the national level (N) can be constructed as
in Equation (6), where  is the adjustment parameter for converting air dispersion
model iF sample parameters to the extended parameters at the national level,
POPt
is the urban population at year t,4 and POPt0
is the urban population at
t0
= 1997, which was chosen as the base year in the intake fraction estimations:
. (6)
Hence, one can estimate the health effects by sector. Following Ho and
Jorgenson's (2007) definition, the total dosage DOSEjxt
of pollutant x for sector
j is defined as the product of iFxt
and the total national emissions of pollutant
x from sector j. Now substitute in the definition of the intake fraction from
Equation (5), and the dosage can be interpreted as the quantity of pollutant x
inhaled by the total population in location d exposed to concentration C of
industrial emissions from sector j, summed over all locations d in the country
(Ho and Jorgenson, 2007).
. (7)
This paper also takes into account secondary particles of sulfate (SO2
) and
nitrate (NOx), thus the dosage of total PM10
can be expressed as follows:
. (8)
Based on the epidemiology literature, one can derive the quantity of physical
health damage Djht
of each health endpoint h for sector j, by multiplying the
dose-response coefficients DRhx
by the pollutant dosage DOSEjxt
, and dividing
by the breathing rate BR, then summing over all the pollutants x:
(h = mortality, respiratory hospital admissions), (9)
where h denotes various types of health endpoints, including mortality, respiratory
hospital admissions, emergency room visits, restricted activity days, lower
respiratory infection/child (asthmatic), asthma attacks, chronic bronchitis,
respiratory symptoms and so forth.

The impact of pollution on each health endpoint is only a subcategory of the
aggregate negative `output' of health damage. Differing from Repetto et al.
(1996) and Swinand (1999), this paper does not use emissions to calculate the
quantity index of health damages, but uses the physical impacts of health
effects directly to calculating the quantity index.
Estimating the time-series price of health effects
If one treats environmental quality as a normal good (i.e. people demand more
when their income increases), then the time-series unit price of health damages
needs to be updated with time t.
Mortality The valuation of mortality is based on the willingness to pay (WTP)
approach, which reflects an individual's preference on environmental quality. In
view of the technical, financial and temporal requirements for generating local
WTP estimates, a benefit transfer (BT) approach is used to calculate the value
of averted premature deaths. Following Ho and Jorgenson (2007), the present
paper uses the average value found in the Zhou and Hammit (2007) study of
Beijing and Anqing: approximately 367 600 yuan. GDP per capita is used to
adjust the unit price of averted premature death to each time point t:
. (10)
Morbidity The BT method is also applied to derive a morbidity value, which is
based on the World Bank (1997) study. First, the US dollar currency value used
in the World Bank's study is converted to the Chinese yuan, and then the unit
value of each morbidity endpoint h is adjusted by GDP per capita in China and
CPI in the USA:
. (11)
Aggregate index of sectoral health damage output
The sections above summarize the calculation of quantity and price indexes for
each health endpoint for each manufacturing sector. To construct an aggregate
index of health damage output (negative) or input (positive) over all the health
endpoints, including mortality, respiratory hospital admissions, chronic bronchitis,
this paper assumes that sectoral health damages, Djt
, can be expressed as a
translog function of each individual component of health Dhj,t
. The corresponding
index of sectoral health damage is a translog quantity index of individual health
endpoint damage:

.
An alternative way to measure the quantity index of environmental damages
is to use the index of quality adjusted life years (QALY) method, which combines
both the length and quality of life into a single measure. This method has been
extensively used in studies concerning cost-effectiveness in developed countries.
However, the QALY method requires enormous data, including human charac-
teristics and lifetime projections. In the developing countries like China, it is
very difficult to apply this method to measure environmental damages because
of the inadequacy of the available data. Therefore, the present paper still uses the
conventional `environmental damage impact path' method and dose-response
functions to measure air pollution-associated health damages.
III.5 The concept of green output
Green GDP has been used by environmentalists and economists for many years by
adjusting the traditional GDP concept through a deduction of negative environ-
mental and resource impacts. To measure `true' productivity growth, one must
not only capture the efficiency of a society's use of scarce marketed resources,
but also take into account the efficiency of non-market resources, such as air quality.
For this purpose, this paper defines a new `green output' concept W for the
green TFP calculations. This is an aggregate index of the market output Y and
non-market residue `output' of negative environmental damages D:
d ln W = sy
d ln Y + sd
d ln D, (13)
where sy
and sd
are the share of the value of market output Y and the share of
the value of environmental damages D in the value of `green output', respectively.
Because environmental damages are negative, residual `output', sd
, is a negative
term that implicitly suggests that the shadow price of negative environmental
quality is negative as well. Whether environmental damages are treated as negative
outputs or as positive inputs, the results are the same numerically.
IV. Methodology
The basic idea here is to incorporate the non-market undesirable output `pollution'
into the green TFP framework. Let us start with the conventional TFP

methodology, assuming that the total technology change is the unexplained
residual of productivity growth (Solow, 1957). Then one can treat environmental
damages, predominantly air pollution-associated health damages (World Bank,
1997), as an undesirable non-market traded `output' from the production process,
and return it to the conventional TFP framework, as discussed in Section IV.2.
IV.1 Measurement of conventional total factor productivity index
Because the present paper focuses on TFP at the industry level, let us assume
that each sector has a unique linearly homogenous function f j(·). The production
is characterized as constant returns to scale. The sectoral output Yj
can be
expressed as a function of two primary inputs, capital input Kj
and labor input
Lj
, and two aggregate intermediate inputs, energy aggregate Ej
and non-energy
material aggregate Mj
. T denotes time that indexes technology level:
Yj
= f j(Kj
, Lj
, Ej
, Mj
, T). (14)
Now, sectoral TFP can be derived by taking total logarithmical differentiation
of Equation (14), which yields:
(15)
In reality, each sector might face different wages or rental prices as well as
different marginal products of their inputs. Therefore, this paper models specific
prices for all the inputs. Now the sectoral planner needs to maximize the sectoral
profits subject to the production function (Equation 14)

, Mj
, T) - PK, j

- PL, j
· Lj
- PE, j
· Ej
- PM, j
· Mj
. (16)
Taking first-order conditions will yield the sector specific equilibrium
conditions
(17)
Equation (17) suggests that the marginal product of all primary and inter-
mediate inputs must be equal to the sectoral specific factor or input prices. In
addition, the following identity must hold, which suggests that the value of total
outputs should equal the value of total inputs.

Substituting the first-order conditions (Equation 17) into Equation (15), one
derives:
(19)
Rearrange the terms, and the conventional TFP can be derived as follows:
(20)
Equation (20) is referred to as the Divisia index of TFP change.
In practice, because of the discrete data points in time, a translog function
is usually assumed if constant returns to scale conditions and concavity
constraints are satisfied. Therefore, for the two discrete periods t and t ­ 1, the
average TFP change can be approximated using the Tornqvist index of TFP
change, which was proved by Diewert (1976):
TFP =  ln Yj
- (
K,j
 ln Kj
+ 
L, j
 ln Lj
+ 
E, j
 ln Ej
+ 
M, j
 ln Mj
), (21)
where x = xT
- xT-1
denotes the change between period T ­ 1 and T, and  is the
two-period average share of the input in the nominal value of adjusted output.
Therefore, the rate of productivity change is defined as the residual of the
growth rate of output after deducting the growth rate of all its input indexes,
which are weighted by their cost share of the total output value.
For each discrete period T, the value share of each input is defined in
Equation (22):5

IV.2 Measurement of green total factor productivity index
Now the conventional TFP can be extended to the green TFP framework by
adding the non-market and undesirable output: environmental damage. Pittman
(1983) proposes a producer-cost measure to model pollution as an undesirable
output. He defines national income as the value of total goods consumption
minus the total abatement costs of reducing pollution. Repetto et al. (1996)
counter that argument by showing how the productivity growth measure
misrepresents the industrial process by taking only pollution abatement costs
into account and ignoring pollution damage averted. Repetto et al. also conduct
an empirical study of green productivity in electricity power, pulp and paper,
and agriculture sectors in the USA.
In addition, following Repetto's work, several recent studies argue that
pollution should not be valued at its (negative) shadow producer's price, but at
its (negative) shadow consumer price from the social welfare perspective,
thereby suggesting that the consumer's marginal rate of substitution between
pollution and numeraire composite good replace the marginal abatement cost
(Swinand 1999; Chaston 1997; Chaston et al. 1997; Swinand 1999). Although
Repetto's study makes a significant contribution in this field, as Swinand (1999)
points, Repetto does not derive his green TFP measurement from productivity
theory. In addition, the present paper finds that Repetto's green TFP method
revises the share weight for output and pollutant emissions, but keeps the same
input share parameters for other inputs, as in the conventional TFP framework;
this might violate the dual identity between the production model and the
consumption model (Equation 26).
Using a similar consumer demand-side approach, as in Chaston et al. (1997) and
Swinand (1999), let us modify the conventional TFP analysis by posing a transforma-
tion function Wj(·), with the scale of the green output denoted as a scalar, wj:
wj  Wj(Yj
, Kj
, Lj
, Ej
, Mj
, Dj
, T), (24)
where Yj
= f j(Kj
, Lj
, Ej
, Mj
, T) and Dj
is the quantity of environmental health
damages. wj denotes the maximum scale level of augmented output,6 which
includes both desirable marketable outputYj
and undesirable non-marketable Dj
.
Now taking the total logarithmic derivative of Equation (24) and solving
for the partial derivative of Wj with respect to the time-based technology level
6. The scale of output can be normalized to unity with no loss of generality.
GREEN PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH IN CHINA 439

T, we can derive a similar equation to Equation (15) in the conventional TFP
framework:
(25)
The change in Wj with respect to time-based technology level T is defined as
green productivity growth: green TFP in this paper.
Now the identity equations are given as follows:
. (26)
Based on standard perfect competition, constant returns to scale, and the
necessary conditions for profit maximization, the following first-order conditions
can be derived, which make Equation (25) tractable in practice:
(27)
Substituting the above first-order conditions (27) into Equation (25), we
obtain the green TFP as follows:
(28)
As with the approximation procedure for the conventional TFP discussed in
Section IV.1, one can derive a Tornqvist index of green TFP change as follows:
GreenTFP = ß

), (29)
where x = xT
- xT-1
denotes the change between period T ­ 1 and T, and ß is the
two-period average share of the input in the nominal value of adjusted output.
Compared to the conventional TFP approach, in this green TFP framework there
is one additional negative output term or positive input term, an environmental

of the share parameter is not the value of marketable output, but the value of
green output in which the damages of environmental pollutions are netted out.
V. Empirical Results
Table 1 lists a snapshot view for the year 2000 based on the IO table. In this
study, there are 28 manufacturing sectors, in which the largest sector by value-
added or gross output is construction, followed by electrical machinery and
chemical sectors. The sector with the lowest gross output is gas utilities. The
sector with the largest capital stock is the transportation sector, followed by the
electric sector. The construction sector not only produces the largest gross output
but also requires the most labor inputs. The transportation sector consumes the
second most labor. The gross output of the total 28 manufacturing sectors was
19 193 billion yuan in 2000, equalling approximately 72 percent of GDP.
Table 2 gives the growth rates of output, inputs and health damage averaged
over 1991­2000. Some `high tech' industries and light manufacturing industries,
such as electrical machinery, communications, instruments, furniture and fixtures
and apparel industries, grew very fast. Industries that are heavy polluters, such as
construction, chemicals, primary metal, stone, clay, and glass industries, also grew
fast in our sample period. The gross output growth rate of the biggest air pollution
emitter, the electricity sector, is modest at approximately 9.2 percent per year.
Growth of sectoral capital, labor, energy aggregate inputs, and non-energy
material aggregate inputs are reported in the next four columns of Table 2.
Recall that because it is assumed that the growth rate in the capital quality is
too small, the growth rate in capital input is roughly equal to the growth in the
capital stock. In most energy intensive and some heavily polluted sectors, such
as coal mining, oil and gas extraction, construction, miscellaneous manufactur-
ing, transportation, electric utilities and gas utilities, the growth rate of capital
input is higher than that of output. For these sectors, the growth rates are mainly
driven by the rapid growth rates in capital inputs. However, this might be due to
an overestimate or poor guesses of the initial capital stock for those sectors. For
example, in the electricity sector, the deflators used in Ren's capital dataset
might be underestimated. In the other sectors, the growth rates of capital inputs
are smaller than the growth rates of the gross outputs.
The growth rate in labor inputs is modest for most of the manufacturing sectors.
In the 1990s, most trade-oriented sectors and labor-intensive sectors, such as
apparel, leather, construction, electrical machinery, miscellaneous manufacturing,
electric utilities and gas utilities, had very high growth rates. For the energy and
non-energy material aggregate, growth rate patterns for labor inputs are similar
to output growth. Although some sectors had higher growth in energy aggregate
inputs, others had higher growth in non-energy aggregate inputs.

Using the environmental damage estimation methods introduced in Section
III.4, the sixth column of Table 2 provides the growth rate of the quantity index
of environmental health damage for the sample period 1991­2000. One can see
that in many manufacturing sectors, the growth rate of environmental damage
far exceeds the growth rate of gross output, or any of the inputs, except for
rapidly growing industries, such as electrical machinery, instruments, motor
vehicles, transportation equipment, communications, or some relatively cleaner
industries, such as printing, publishing, and leather industries. This suggests
that although China has experienced rapid growth in overall output or GDP,
environmental damage is growing more rapidly in many sectors. Those negative
impacts are currently ignored by the conventional accounting systems. Green
GDP and green TFP are two promising methods for adjusting these biases.
The conventional TFP and green TFP calculations of the contribution of energy
aggregates, non-energy material aggregates, and capital and labor inputs are shown
in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Table 4 also presents the negative contribution of
environmental damages for the green TFP method in column six.
The biggest contributor of environmental damages is non-energy materials.
The contributions from energy, capital and labor inputs are relatively low,
except for the communication sector in which the contribution of capital input
is very high, explaining almost half of output growth. Oil and gas extraction,
and the transportation sector also have high growth rates of capital inputs; this
could be explained by their huge amounts of capital instalments in new facilities.
Because of the slow growth rates of the Chinese labor force, the contribution of
the growth rate of output is also very low for most of the manufacturing sectors,
except for some labor-intensive sectors, such as construction, apparel, leather,
transportation, communications and gas utilities. The smallest, even negative
contributions are also those that have low growth rates in gross output, such as
coal mining, textile mill products, and oil and gas extraction.
This paper finds that for some `high tech' sectors, such as electrical machinery,
instruments, and communications, the growth rate of TFP is fairly high. Some
energy and resource-related sectors, such as metal and nonmetal mining, primary
metal, petroleum and the coal product sector also show high positive TFP
growth. This could reflect the rapid technology changes in these sectors, as well
as the the rapid transfer of foreign technology or improved management practices
in these sectors during the 1990s. However, the other energy-related sectors,
such as oil and gas extraction, electric utilities and gas utilities all show negative
TFP growth. This result might be explained by the fact that land input is not taken
into account because of data limitations. The large price effects from economic
reforms might also have affected the results. For example, before economic
reform, some government-protected sectors had lower than average input prices.
After economic reform and deregulation, their input prices were raised to the
market level. Therefore, the growth rate of inputs is biased upward and might drive
down overall sectoral TFP growth. In addition, the estimates on the rate of return
to capital in these sectors might be biased, because of insufficient official data.

As shown in Table 4, the value share of environmental damage to the value
of output is very small for most of the manufacturing sectors, except for the
electric utilities and transportation sectors. The first column of Table 4 shows
the revised output, which is equal to ß

 ln Yj
in equation (29). Because ß
Y, j
exceeds 1, the first column in Table 4 actually has a larger value of output com-
pared to the first column in Table 3. Because this paper uses green output as the
denominator to calculate the weighted average of value shares of all inputs, the
contributions of energy aggregate, non-energy material aggregate, and capital
and labor inputs are slightly larger than those in Table 3. The sixth column of
Table 4 shows the contribution of the environmental health damage. Note that
the share parameter on environmental damage is negative; therefore, the
positive contribution of environmental damage suggests that the growth rate
of environmental damage is negative. This indicates that there are efficiency
improvements in terms of pollution abatement in that sector. One can see that

energy intensive sectors, in particular electric utilities, have very negative
contributions to environmental damage. This suggests there were negative
improvements in technical efficiency in terms of pollution abatement of the
1990s, although this effect is partly magnified by the relatively high weights of
environmental cost shares compared to other sectors. Similarly, gas utilities,
transportation, petroleum and coal products, paper and allied, and construction
sectors all indicate that environmental damage became worse in the 1990s.
Only coal mining, metal and nonmetal mining, food products, transportation
equipment, and miscellaneous manufacturing sectors improved pollution
abatement efficiencies. For all other sectors, the contributions of environmental
damage are almost zero. This could be because there was no change in terms of

the emission abatement, or the weight of damages was too small. For those
sectors, the conventional TFP and green TFP would derive the same results.
This paper further divides the decade from 1991 to 2000 into three periods:
1991­1994, 1994­1997 and 1997­2000. The summary results of the growth
rate and contribution of environmental damages for all the 28 manufacturing
sectors are given in Table 5.
In the first period 1991­1994, China shifted from a conservative planned
economy towards a more open market economy. In particular, after Deng
Xiaoping's trip to southern China, the country officially declared that it would
build a socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics, which was
accompanied by a rise in numerous `development zones' in coastal cities of east
and southeast China. With rapid FDI inflow and further reform of the SOEs,
China's overall GDP increased very fast and the growth rate exceeded
10 percent annually. However, during this period, energy use and resource use
increased very rapidly; energy efficiency was very low and environmental policy
lagged behind economic policy. Environmental damage escalated very quickly,
in particular in electricity utilities, gas utilities, petroleum and coal product,
and primary metal sectors. From Table 5, one can see that the growth rates of
environmental damage for the pollution-intensive sectors, such as electric utilities,
primary metal, petroleum, and coal products, in 1991­1994 were higher than
those in the other two periods. From the contribution of the environmental
damage, we can see that the electricity utilities sector had the most negative
contribution because it was one of China's most polluted sectors. Similarly,
primary metal, construction, chemicals, petroleum and coal products also made
large contributions in terms of environmental damage.
For the second period of 1994­1997, the importance of the SOE was down-
graded while private ownership, township and village industrial enterprises
were elevated as important components of China's economy. Although these
small private firms were more able to fit into the new market-oriented economy,
very few of them were equipped with emission abatement facilities or end pipe
treatments at that time. Therefore, for sectors like stone, clay, glass, printing
and publishing, leather, and paper, the growth rate of environmental damage
was very high. In 1996, SEPA enlarged the geographical area to collect the SO2
emission charge at 0.20 yuan per kg for SO2
emissions. However, environmental
regulations (and their implementation) were still very weak right after the
policy changes. Therefore, heavy polluting sectors, such as electric utilities, gas
utilities and primary metal, continued to contribute to high growth rates of
pollution emissions and environmental health damage.
In the third period of 1997­2000, the Chinese Government further expanded
the area for SO2
pollution charge collection to almost the whole country. Two
acid rain control zones were designated in southern and south-eastern China. In
addition, China's coal washing capacity increased significantly from 1996 to 2000,
over which period annual SO2
are estimated to have reduced by approximately
0.18 million ton (Hao et al. 2001). In addition, a series of industrial policies,

power sector regulation, and effective environmental policy regulations, especially
command and control policies with requirements for end pipe abatement
technologies, started to play an important role in reducing particulate matters
and SO2
. The economy's structural change and shift in the types of energy used
also improved technology efficiency of pollution mitigation. This is evident in
Table 5: for pollution intensive sectors, such as electric utilities and primary
metal, the growth rates of environmental damage have dropped by almost
60 percent. In the chemical industry, the growth rate of damage is even negative.
In addition, for the electricity utility sector, the contribution between 1997
and 2000 is only ­0.2, only one-quarter of that in the other periods. The negative
contribution in the primary metal sector also decreased to approximately
one-quarter of its previous contribution. Because of the negative growth rate of
environmental damage, the contribution in the chemical sector even had a
positive contribution between 1997 and 2000. In contrast, because of the increasing
demand for gas usage, for the gas utilities sector, the growth rate of environmental
damage was positive and doubled between 1997 and 2000.
For some modern `high tech' sectors, such as machinery, non-elect sector,
motor vehicles, transportation equipment, and instrument, the growth rates of
environmental damage are declining for all three periods. This might be
because of the overall efficiency improvement in the whole decade.
A new phenomenon of a dramatically rising real estate market appeared in the
late 1990s. Therefore, the growth rate and negative contribution of environmental
damage in the construction sector increased very quickly, with the rate almost
tripling. In the stone, clay and glass sector, the growth rate and negative
contribution of environmental damage almost doubled as well.
One can also see that in the transportation sector, environmental damage also
increased dramatically from about 3 percent between 1991 and 1997 to about
12 percent between 1997 and 2000. The contribution of environmental
damage from 1997 to 2000 had increased by over eight times compared to the
1991­1994 period. This is primary due to the rapidly increasing demand for
transportation and motor vehicle, as well as the weak environmental policy on
controlling motor vehicle emissions.
China's environmental policy implementations concerning small private
firms and township and village industrial enterprises (TVIE) were still very
weak during 1997­2000. Therefore, environmental damage was still increasing
quickly in the sectors that were primarily composed of small firms, such as food
products, textile mill products, apparel, lumber and wood, furniture and fixtures,
paper and communications. Most of the sectors in this category seem to have
small low growth rates in environmental damage between 1991 and 1994,
which might reflect their overall efficiency improvements in the production
activities.
The calculations in this paper are still very crude, and only health damage
associated with air pollution were included. In future studies, other types of
environmental damage, such as water pollution, ecosystem degradation, should

be incorporated to provide a more complete picture of green productivity in
China. However, the proposed new green TFP methodology and empirical study
in this paper still shed some light on the trends of environmental technological
efficiency and the effectiveness of air pollution-related environmental policies
in China's manufacturing sectors.
VI. Conclusion
Increasing environmental damage is threatening China's future sustainable
development. It is clear that the Chinese Government must become more con-
cerned about both economic productivity growth and environmental protection.
However, the conventional TFP method would bias the overall technological
efficiency estimation and ignore any efficiency changes in emission abatements
and environmental damages. From a welfare point of view, our study provides
an unbiased measure, green TFP, for estimating the overall efficiency changes
created through both production technologies and environmental technologies
and from efficiency improvements through enhanced management.
For the decade from 1991 to 2000, the most important period for China's
ongoing economic reform, we found that the overall environment deterioration
of 1991 to 1997 was slightly mitigated in the late 1990s due to the stringent
environmental regulation implemented in some heavily polluted sectors, such
as electricity utilities, primary metal and chemical industries. However, the
environmental damage caused by those sectors with many small private firms
and TVIE continued throughout the whole decade. Driven by the growth in real
estate and motor vehicle markets, rising environmental damage and negative
contributions to green TFP in the construction and transportation sectors are
posing serious challenges to SEPA and the Chinese Government.
Although this green TFP framework is a very useful tool for measuring
efficiency changes in terms of environmental technology or management, one
should also keep in mind that this method should not replace the conventional
TFP measures, but only supplement the existing TFP accounting method.
Currently, our estimation of China's green TFP is still very crude. Because of
data limitations, the present study scope is limited to the measurement of air
pollution-associated health damages in the green TFP framework. Therefore, a
more reliable record of productivity growth depends on an adequate informa-
tion data base regarding all pollutants. This requires the coordination of both
SEPA and the NBS to coordinate developing an environmental database, for
providing more complete and reliable data to explain the past, and to guide
future directions in environmental policy reform.
