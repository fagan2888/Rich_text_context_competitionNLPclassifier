Depression With Atypical Features
in the National Comorbidity Survey
Classification, Description, and Consequences
Louis S. Matza, PhD; Dennis A. Revicki, PhD; Jonathan R. Davidson, MD; Jonathan W. Stewart, MD
Background: Atypical depression has been found to be
distinct from other types of depression in terms of psy-
chiatric symptom profile and treatment response. How-
ever, debate continues regarding its specific character-
istics, impact, and diagnostic criteria. The current study
was conducted to increase understanding of atypical de-
pression diagnosed using only the reversed vegetative
symptoms of hypersomnia and hyperphagia.
Methods: An atypical depression group (n=304 [36.4%
of the depressed sample; 39.0% when weighted to ap-
proximate the national population]) was identified within
the US National Comorbidity Survey, which assessed psy-
chiatric disorders among a nationally representative
sample using the Composite International Diagnostic In-
terview. The atypical group was identified based on DSM-
III-R criteria for a major depressive episode, in addition
to atypical features of hypersomnia and hyperphagia.
Comparison groups were those with nonatypical depres-
sion (n=532) and individuals without a psychiatric dis-
order (n=4071).
Results: Compared with nonatypical depression, atypi-
cal depression was associated with a greater percentage
of women and an earlier age of onset. The atypical group
also reported higher rates of most depressive symp-
toms, suicidal thoughts and attempts, psychiatric co-
morbidity (panic disorder, social phobia, and drug de-
pendence), disability and restricted activity days, use of
some health care services, paternal depression, and child-
hood neglect and sexual abuse (P.05). Compared with
people without psychiatric disorders, the atypical group
reported higher rates of disability and restricted activity
days, use of all mental health care services, parental de-
pression, and childhood abuse (P.001).
Conclusions: This analysis of a nationally represen-
tative US sample suggests that overeating and over-
sleeping can be used to identify an atypical depression
subgroup that is distinct from other depressed patients
in terms of demographics, psychiatric comorbidities,
and abuse history. Findings also suggest that atypical
depression is associated with increased distress, sui-
cidal ideation, and disability compared with nonatypi-
cal depression.

WEST AND Dally1 pro-
posed the term
atypical depression
to describe a type of
depression that was
unique in its symptom profile and re-
sponse to drug treatment. Subsequent
studies have consistently found that pa-
tients with atypical depression demon-
strate relative unresponsiveness to tricy-
clic antidepressants, but tend to respond
well to monoamine oxidase inhibitors.2-5
In addition to these differences in treat-
ment response, patients with atypical de-
pression have been shown to differ from
other depressed patients in terms of psy-
chiatric symptom patterns,6-10 biological
profile,11-13 sleepcharacteristics,14 ageofon-
set,6,15-17 and male-female ratio.15,16,18,19 De-
spite this substantial body of evidence in-
dicating that atypical depression is a valid
specifier of mood disorders, debate in the
literature continues regarding its specific
characteristics and diagnostic crite-
ria.20-22 Partly as a result of these defini-
tional inconsistencies, physicians may have
difficulty recognizing atypical depres-
sion, and consequently, they may fre-
quently initiate ineffective pharmacologi-
cal treatments.23,24 Thus, further research
is needed on the characteristics and diag-
nostic criteria of atypical depression.
The Columbia criteria, which were
developed by a group of researchers at Co-
lumbia University, New York, NY, are
commonly used for diagnosing atypical de-
pression.17 According to this diagnostic
system, an episode of major depression is
classified as atypical by the presence of
mood reactivity in addition to any 2 of the

following 4 symptoms: hypersomnia, either increased ap-
petite or weight gain, leaden paralysis, and rejection sen-
sitivity. This diagnostic approach has been used to ef-
fectively identify an atypical depression group in
numerous clinical studies,25-29 and it was incorporated as
a specifier of a major depressive episode of major de-
pressive disorder and bipolar mood disorder in the no-
menclature of the DSM-IV.30 However, other research-
ers have questioned the Columbia criteria, particularly
with regard to the central role of mood reactivity.8,20-22
The current study used a different diagnostic ap-
proach that emphasizes reversed vegetative symptoms for
identification of atypical depression. The reversed veg-
etative approach identifies atypical depression based on
hypersomnia and hyperphagia, in contrast to the insom-
nia and weight loss commonly found in melancholic de-
pression. Some empirical research has suggested that this
relatively simple approach can reliably identify an atypi-
cal depression group, although it does not consider mood
reactivity. For example, one study of depression sub-
types compared demographics, symptom profile, and
treatment response between reversed vegetative pa-
tients with mood reactivity and those without mood re-
activity.22 Few differences were found between the groups,
suggesting that mood reactivity was not necessary for the
identification of an atypical group in that sample. Further
support for the reversed vegetative approach is provided
by research that has diagnosed atypical depression solely
on the basis of these symptoms. These studies have gen-
erally identified groups with the expected atypical charac-
teristics such as earlier age of onset, greater proportion of
women, and more comorbid anxiety symptoms com-
pared with other depressed patients.6,7,10 In addition, re-
sultsofaclinicaltrialsuggestthatreversedvegetativesymp-
toms may be important for guiding treatment strategies.
That study found that a monoamine oxidase inhibitor was
more effective than placebo for treating atypical depres-
sion with reversed vegetative symptoms, but also found no
drug-placebo differences for depression without reversed
vegetative symptoms.31 If the reversed vegetative diagnos-
tic approach can identify atypical depression with reason-
able accuracy, its relative simplicity may be a significant
advantage in primary care settings, where atypical depres-
sion is frequently unrecognized and thus at risk for inef-
fective treatment.23,24
The present study identified a group of atypical
depressed participants in a national survey sample on
the basis of the reversed vegetative symptoms of hyper-
somnia and hyperphagia. This atypical depression
group was compared with a nonatypical depression
group and a comparison group of individuals without a
psychiatric disorder. A range of variables was examined
in these analyses, including psychiatric comorbidities,
suicidal thoughts and behavior, use of health care ser-
vices, disability days, and history of abuse. It was hy-
pothesized that the current atypical depression group
would demonstrate features similar to those of atypical
groups in previous studies, thus providing additional vali-
dation for the reversed vegetative diagnostic approach.
In addition, analyses were expected to provide in-
creased understanding of the characteristics and conse-
quences of atypical depression.
METHODS
SAMPLE
The sample was selected from the US National Comorbidity
Survey (NCS),32 a nationally representative household survey
of persons aged 15 to 54 years in the 48 coterminous United
States, along with a supplemental sample of students living in
campus group housing. The NCS was administered to 8098 re-
spondents between September 14, 1990, and February 6, 1992,
in face-to-face interviews occurring in the participants' homes,
averaging more than 2 hours in length. The response rate was
82.4%. The sample distributions on demographic variables such
as age, sex, race, marital status, and socioeconomic status were
similar to population distributions reported by the US Census
Bureau. The data in all analyses were weighted to adjust for se-
lection rates, response rates, and sociodemographic discrep-
ancies between the final sample and the US population. Char-
acteristics of the full sample as well as additional description
of the NCS design and weighting procedures are reported
elsewhere.32,33
As previously reported, the NCS interview was adminis-
tered in 2 parts.34 Part 1, which included diagnostic assess-
ment, was administered to the full sample of 8098 partici-
pants. Part 2 was designed to assess the consequences of
psychiatric disorders. It included assessment of risk factors and
use of health care services, and it was administered to 5877 re-
spondents selected from the total sample.
DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT AND
DETERMINATION OF DEPRESSION SUBGROUPS
The DSM-III-R diagnoses35 were assigned on the basis of re-
sponses to a modified version of the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 1.0),36 which was administered as
part of the NCS. The CIDI is a structured diagnostic interview
that was designed to be used by trained interviewers who are
not clinicians. The CIDI diagnoses examined in this study have
demonstrated adequate reliability and validity in the World
Health Organization CIDI field trials37 and an NCS clinical re-
appraisal study of the CIDI.38
For this report, analyses included only the NCS respon-
dents who met DSM-III-R35 criteria for a major depressive epi-
sode during the year before completing the survey (n=836) and
the respondents who had never had a psychiatric disorder
(n=4071). The participants within the depression group were
then classified as having atypical or nonatypical depression on
the basis of their responses to questions concerning specific
symptoms. The NCS only assessed depressive symptoms of the
respondents' self-defined worst lifetime episode. Because pat-
terns of atypical features tend to be stable across depressive epi-
sodes,39-41 symptoms of this single depressive episode were con-
sidered to be adequate for classification purposes.
The atypical depression subgroup (n=304 [36.4% of the
depressed sample; 39.0% when weighted to reflect the na-
tional population]) was identified according to the presence of
hypersomnia and hyperphagia. Subjects were considered to have
experienced hypersomnia if their depressive episode included
"a period of 2 weeks or longer when nearly every day you were
sleeping too much." Subjects were considered to have experi-
enced hyperphagia if they endorsed either of the following 2
items: "at least 2 weeks when you had an increase in appetite"
or "a period when you gained 2 pounds a week or 10 pounds
altogether."
Subjects who had a major depressive episode, but did not
meet these criteria for atypical depression, were placed in the
nonatypical depression comparison group (n=532). This group
is fairly heterogeneous with regard to the depressive vegeta-

tive symptoms. The majority of this group (53.1%) had mel-
ancholic features of undersleeping (eg, early morning awak-
ening) and undereating (eg, weight loss). The remainder of
this group reported the following combinations of vegetative
symptoms: 7.8% possible atypical (overeating or oversleep-
ing), 10.3% possible melancholic (undereating or under-
sleeping), 26.7% mixed (overeating/undersleeping or over-
sleeping/undereating), and 2.2% nonvegetative (no vegetative
symptoms reported).
ASSESSMENT OF ADDITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS
The NCS was a broad survey that assessed a wide range of char-
acteristics related to mental health. The present study used a
subset of these characteristics to compare the atypical depres-
sion group with the nonatypical depression and the no disor-
ders groups. Six types of characteristics were selected: (1) de-
mographics, (2) comorbid psychiatric disorders, (3) depressive
symptoms, (4) use of health care services, (5) history of abuse
and parental depression, and (6) disability days and restricted
activity days. Specific variables within these categories are de-
scribed in the following paragraphs.
Demographic Characteristics
Sex, ethnicity (white, African American, Latino, or other), level
of education (0-11, 12, 13-15, or 15 years), and marital sta-
tus (currently married, divorced/separated, or never married)
were examined. The respondents' age and their age of onset of
the first depressive episode were also examined.
Psychiatric Comorbidities
The atypical and nonatypical groups were compared in terms
of their comorbidity with other DSM-III-R disorders as as-
sessed by means of the CIDI. These analyses examined preva-
lence of the following diagnoses within the year before com-
pleting the survey: dysthymia, manic episode, panic disorder,
agoraphobia, simple phobia, social phobia, generalized anxi-
ety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, drug dependence,
and alcohol dependence.
Depression-Related Symptoms
The atypical and nonatypical groups were compared with re-
spect to a number of depressive symptoms to provide a more
thorough picture of atypical depression. These symptoms in-
clude periods of 2 weeks or more with decreased energy, an-
hedonia, feelings of worthlessness, and difficulty concentrat-
ing. In addition, suicidality was assessed with items asking
whether respondents had ever attempted suicide, thought about
committing suicide, or had a period of 2 weeks or more when
they felt like they wanted to die.
Use of Health Care Services
Several items were selected from the NCS to compare the use of
health care services of subjects with atypical depression, non-
atypical depression, and no psychiatric diagnoses. These yes-
or-no items asked whether the respondent had seen various types
of health care professionals or received various types of treat-
ments for "emotions, nerves, or use of alcohol or drugs." For the
current study, items were selected that assessed whether respon-
dents had ever been admitted for a night in the hospital, seen any
health care professional, or been to the hospital emergency de-
partment. Additional items were selected to assess use of health
care services within the year before the survey. These questions
asked whether respondents had seen a general practitioner, a psy-
chiatrist, a psychologist, a social worker, or a counselor; taken
any prescription or antidepressant medication; and felt that they
might need to see a professional.
History of Abuse and Parental Depression
Five items were selected from the NCS to compare rates of abuse
history and parental depression of subjects with atypical de-
pression, nonatypical depression, and no psychiatric diag-
noses. Three items asked whether respondents were ever "physi-
cally abused," "seriously neglected," or "sexually molested" as
a child. Two items asked whether the respondent's natural
mother or father "ever have periods lasting 2 weeks or more
when she/he was depressed, down in the dumps, or blue most
of the time?" A composite variable was then created from these
questions to assess whether either parent had a history of de-
pression.
Disability Days and Restricted Activity Days
A series of 4 questions assessed disability days and restricted
activity days, quantifying respondents' decreases in activity level
during the 30 days before completing the survey. Disability days
were defined as the number of days respondents were "totally
unable to carry out normal activities," including work and lei-
sure activities. Restricted activity days were defined as the num-
ber of days respondents were "able to work and carry out your
normal activities, but had to cut down on what you did or did
not get as much done as usual." For each question, a fol-
low-up item queried, "How many of these days were due to your
emotions, nerves, mental health, or use of alcohol or drugs?"
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The present analyses were conducted using respondents from
the NCS sample who fit into the following 3 study groups: atypi-
cal depression, nonatypical depression, and no psychiatric dis-
orders. Analyses of items that appeared in Part 1 of the NCS
(demographics, psychiatric comorbidities, and depression-
related symptoms) were conducted on a sample of 4907 par-
ticipants from the total NCS sample who fit into the following
3 study groups: 304 with atypical depression, 532 with non-
atypical depression, and 4071 with no disorder. Analyses of items
that appeared in Part 2 of the NCS (use of health care services
and disability and restricted activity days) were conducted on
the smaller sample of 2772 respondents of the 5877 to whom
Part 2 was administered: 294 with atypical depression, 509 with
nonatypical depression, and 1969 with no disorder.
Descriptive statistics were calculated. For continuous vari-
ables, means and SDs are reported. For categorical variables, per-
centages for each study group are reported. To assess whether
the atypical depression group differed from each of the 2 com-
parison groups with respect to the demographic variables of sex,
race, education, and marital status, 2 analyses were performed.
Separate sets of logistic regressions were used to compare
the atypical depression group with the nonatypical depression
and no disorders groups for dichotomous dependent vari-
ables. These analyses examined group differences in comor-
bidity, depressive symptoms, use of health care services, abuse
history, and parental history of depression while controlling
for sex, race (white or nonwhite), and education (12 or 12
years). Each equation contained a dichotomous depression vari-
able as a predictor (coded as 1 for atypical depression and 0
for the comparison group). Odds ratios (ORs), 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs), and significance levels are reported. All
significance tests were 2-tailed.
Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and t tests were used to
compare the groups with respect to continuous variables. The

ANOVA models compared all 3 groups in terms of age, dis-
ability days, and restricted activity days. Significant group dif-
ferences were then examined with Student-Newman-Keuls post
hoc tests. A t test compared atypical with nonatypical depres-
sion with respect to age of onset. Results of all analyses were
considered statistically significant at a level of P.05.
RESULTS
DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS
In comparisons between the atypical and nonatypical de-
pression groups, no significant differences were found for
education (2
3
=2.7; P.45; Table 1), but there were sta-
tistically significant differences in all other demographic
variables. The atypical depression group had a higher pro-
portion of women (2
1
=9.2; P.002), and the 2 groups dif-
fered with respect to ethnicity (2
3
=9.0; P.02) and mari-
tal status (2
2
=8.4; P.02). A follow-up logistic regression
was performed to explain the marital status difference, us-
ing a dichotomous depression subtype variable as a pre-
dictor (coded as 1 for atypical depression and 0 for non-
atypical depression) and a dichotomous marital statusÂ­
dependent variable (coded as 1 for never married and 0 for
currently married or separated). This model demon-
stratedthattheatypicalgrouphadsignificantlygreaterodds
of never having been married (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.1;
P.004).Comparedwiththenonatypicaldepressiongroup,
atypicaldepressionwasassociatedwithayoungerage(mean
age, 30.5 years [SD, 10.4 years] vs 32.4 years [SD, 10.4
years]; t834

age,21.7years[SD,9.4years]vs24.2years[SD,10.6years];
t691
=3.6; P.001).
In comparisons between the atypical depression and
the no disorders groups, significant differences were found
for all demographic variables (Table 1). The atypical de-
pression group had a higher proportion of women
(2
1
=44.6; P.001), and the 2 groups differed with re-
spect to ethnicity (2
3
=19.8; P.001), education (2
3
=17.8;
P.001), and marital status (2
2
=40.5; P.001). A fol-
low-up logistic regression was performed to explain the
marital status difference, and the atypical group had sig-
nificantly greater odds of never having been married (OR,
1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0; P.001). The atypical depression
group was also associated with a younger age (mean age
for the no disorders group, 33.1 years [SD, 11.1 years];
t4373
=4.5; P.001).
PSYCHIATRIC COMORBIDITIES
As shown in Table 2, all ORs were positive, suggesting
that atypical depression was associated with higher over-
all rates of comorbidity than nonatypical depression. Spe-
cifically, the atypical depression group had significantly
greater odds of having panic disorder, social phobia, and
drug dependence. The 2 groups did not differ signifi-
cantly in odds of having dysthymia, a manic episode, ago-
raphobia, simple phobia, generalized anxiety disorder,
posttraumatic stress disorder, or alcohol dependence.
DEPRESSION-RELATED SYMPTOMS
The atypical depression group had significantly greater
odds of reporting anhedonia, feelings of worthlessness,
and decreased energy (Table 3). In addition, atypical
depression was associated with greater odds of suicidal-
ity, including suicide attempts, suicidal thoughts, and
wanting to die (Figure 1). No differences were found
for concentration difficulty.
USE OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES
Compared with nonatypical depression, atypical depres-
sion was associated with greater odds of going to a hos-
pital emergency department for mental health problems
(Table 4). The atypical depression group also had in-
creased odds of taking antidepressants. The 2 groups did
not differ in whether they had been admitted to a hos-
pital, taken any prescription medication, or seen mental
health or medical professionals for psychiatric prob-
lems. Compared with the no disorders group, the atypi-
cal depression group had significantly greater odds of us-
ing all health care services (Table 5).
HISTORY OF ABUSE AND
PARENTAL DEPRESSION
Compared with nonatypical depression, atypical depres-
sion was associated with significantly greater odds of hav-

ing a father with a history of depression (Table 4). The
analyses of the mother's history of depression and the
either-parent composite variable found odds in the
same direction, but the results were not statistically sig-
nificant. The atypical depression group also had in-
creased odds of having been neglected or sexually mo-
lested. Analysis of physical abuse revealed similar
results that reached borderline significance (P=.059).
Compared with the no disorders group, the atypical de-
pression group had significantly greater odds of having
a mother and father with a history of depression and
significantly greater odds of reporting physical abuse,
neglect, or sexual abuse (Table 5).
DISABILITY DAYS AND RESTRICTED
ACTIVITY DAYS
After controlling for sex, ethnicity, and level of educa-
tion, ANOVA models demonstrated significant group dif-
ferences in the following 4 variables (means are shown
in Table 6): disability days (F7,2762
=18.9; P.001), re-
stricted activity days (F7,2762
=21.2; P.001), disability days
due to mental health (F7,2762
=10.2; P.001), and re-
stricted activity days due to mental health (F7,2762
=27.5;
P.001). Post hoc tests showed the same pattern of re-
sponses for each of the 4 dependent variables. Specifi-
cally, atypical depression was associated with signifi-
cantly greater numbers of disability days and restricted
activity days than the 2 other groups, and nonatypical
depression was associated with significantly greater num-
bers of disability days and restricted activity days than
the no disorders group (Figure 2).
COMMENT
Findings indicate that patients with atypical depression are
distinct from other depressed patients. Analyses demon-
strated numerous differences between the atypical depres-
sion group and the 2 comparison groups. Results concern-
ing characteristics that had been previously examined
among these groups were largely consistent with those of
previous literature. For example, compared with the non-
atypical group, the atypical depression group had a higher
percentage of women,16,19,20 an earlier age of onset of de-
pression,6,16,17,19,20 and a higher rate of suicide attempts.20
Patterns of psychiatric comorbidities were also consistent
with previous results in that the atypical depression group
had relatively high rates of panic disorder,6,7,21 social pho-
bia,7,9,10,19,20 and drug abuse.6 These comparisons between
atypicalandnonatypicaldepressionsuggestthatthisstudy's
atypical depression group is similar to atypical depression
samples identified in other studies.
This study also provides additional insight into atypi-
cal depression by examining characteristics that have not
been addressed in previous research on this disorder.
Compared with the nonatypical group, the atypical de-
pression group was more likely to report suicidal thoughts.
The atypical depression group also reported greater num-
bers of disability days and restricted activity days, and
they were more likely to use antidepressants and visit hos-

Furthermore, the atypical depression group was less likely
to have ever been married. It is possible that this pattern
results from interpersonal difficulties related to the com-
mon atypical characteristics of rejection sensitivity and
mood reactivity, which might contribute to instability in
close personal relationships. Although atypical depres-
sion has occasionally been referred to as a minor or a mild
form of depression,42 current results are consistent with
more recent reports, suggesting that atypical depression

can occur in severe cases.20,43 These findings suggest that
that it is important to identify atypically depressed pa-
tients in clinical settings because atypical depression may
be associated with greater impairment and risk than other
types of depression.
Current findings have implications for the assess-
ment of depressive symptoms in clinical research. Be-
cause atypical depression appears to be common and as-
sociated with significant distress, it may be important to
measure improvement in atypical features when evalu-
ating treatments. However, the most commonly used
symptom measures in clinical trials of antidepressants,
the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Mont-
gomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, focus primar-
ily on the melancholic symptoms of depression.44,45 Con-
sequently, it may be advantageous to consider using other
instruments that can capture improvements in symp-
toms of atypical depression. For example, the Inventory
of Depressive Symptomatology includes items that as-
sess atypical features.46,47
Findings also suggest directions for future re-
search concerning the etiology of atypical depression.
Compared with the nonatypical group, the atypical de-
pression group reported significantly higher rates of pa-
ternal depression and a nonsignificant trend toward higher
rates of maternal depression, suggesting a possible pat-
tern of family history. Atypical depression was also as-
sociated with significantly higher rates of childhood ne-
glect and sexual abuse as well as nearly significantly greater
rates of physical abuse (P=.059). The abuse history re-
sults are consistent with a previous study that found in-
creased rates of childhood physical and sexual abuse
among depressed patients with reversed neurovegeta-
tive features in the Ontario community sample.48 A twin
study has demonstrated a partial genetic basis for atypi-
cal depression.39 The rates of early trauma in the cur-

rent sample and the Ontario sample suggest that envi-
ronmental factors may also play a role. For example, some
cases of atypical depression may be a form of traumatic
stress reaction, with symptoms that are distinct from post-
traumatic stress disorder. Because the NCS assessed per-
sonal history with general retrospective questions, how-
ever, current findings should be interpreted with caution,
and further research is needed to draw conclusions about
etiology.
A limitation of the current study involves the diag-
nostic criteria used to identify the atypical depression
group. The atypical depression group was identified
according to the 2 reversed vegetative symptoms,
hypersomnia and hyperphagia. Although some previous
studies have used this reversed vegetative diagnostic
approach,6,7,39 the DSM-IV and most clinical studies use
the relatively complex Columbia criteria,17 which
include 3 additional symptoms: mood reactivity, leaden
paralysis, and rejection sensitivity. Because the NCS did
not assess these 3 symptoms, it is not possible to evalu-
ate the consistency between the present study's atypical
group and a group identified according to the DSM-IV
criteria for depression with atypical features. It is likely
that the reversed vegetative classification system
resulted in a number of false-positive (ie, subjects in the
atypical depression group who would not meet DSM-IV
criteria) and false-negative findings (ie, subjects not
included in the atypical depression group who would
meet DSM-IV criteria). Despite this diagnostic limita-
tion, however, the current results suggest 2 justifica-
tions for using the reversed vegetative criteria when it is
not possible to evaluate all 5 atypical features in the
Columbia criteria. First, the atypical depression group
in the present study is similar in several respects to
atypical groups defined in previous samples using the
Columbia criteria, suggesting substantial overlap
between patients identified with the 2 approaches. Sec-
ond, the reversed vegetative approach identified a clini-
cally meaningful group with increased distress, comor-
bidity, disability, and suicidal risk compared with other
people with depression.
Both the Columbia criteria and the reversed vegeta-
tive approach have strengths. The Columbia system has
a history of careful empirical development,17 and it may
have greater diagnostic precision because it assesses subtle
emotional symptoms. In clinical settings, however, this
diagnostic complexity is likely to be an advantage only
for practitioners who are adequately trained to inter-
view patients about psychiatric characteristics such as
mood reactivity and rejection sensitivity. In contrast, the
relative simplicity of the reversed vegetative approach may
be a significant advantage in primary care medical set-
tings, where atypical depression is frequently unrecog-
nized.23,24 Compared with the Columbia criteria's subtle
emotional characteristics, the 2 reversed vegetative symp-
toms are objectively defined and easy to identify. If these
relatively simple features can truly identify atypical de-
pression with reasonable accuracy as suggested by cur-
rent findings, inclusion of these features in mental health
screenings may improve the recognition and treatment
of atypical depression in clinical settings.
The current study has 2 additional limitations as-
sociated with the NCS assessment procedures. First, di-
agnoses made with the fully structured interview used
in the NCS may not be consistent with clinical assess-
ments,49 and therefore, results should be interpreted with
caution. Second, the NCS data set does not include suf-
ficient information to examine the overlap between atypi-
cal depression and the full range of bipolar disorders. The
NCS includes diagnosis of manic episodes, and a small
proportion of the depressed sample in the current study
met criteria for bipolar I disorder (weighted percent-
ages: 9.6% had a manic episode in past year; 10.4%,
lifetime). Several studies suggest, however, that atypical
features may be associated with bipolar II disor-
der.20,50,51 Because the NCS did not assess history of hy-
pomanic episodes, it is not possible to identify partici-
pants who meet bipolar II criteria.

Overall, this analysis of a nationally representative
sample suggests that overeating and oversleeping can be
used to identify a distinct atypical depression subgroup
that is associated with increased distress and disability
compared with other depressed groups. These in-
creased risks, including relatively high suicide rates, un-
derscore the importance of recognizing and effectively
treating patients with atypical depression. Based on the
current findings, a diagnostic approach involving only
the 2 reversed vegetative symptoms appear to be a rea-
sonably accurate screening strategy for identifying the
atypical subgroup among depressed patients who pre-
sent in general practice settings.
