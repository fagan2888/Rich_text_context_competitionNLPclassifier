Impact of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms
on Public Health in the United States
David O. Wiebers, MD; James C. Torner, PhD; and Irene Meissner, MD
Background and Purpose: Unruptured intracranial aneurysms constitute a significant public health
problem that has not been quantified. The purpose of this study is to document the magnitude of this
problem in the United States.
Methods: National Hospital Discharge Survey data from 1979, 1984, and 1989 served as the basis for
calculating patient numbers and frequency distributions. Cost estimates included the direct costs of
hospitalization and surgery for those who had surgery, disability and lost income from morbidity, and lost
income from mortality.
Results: The estimated lifetime cost (including hospitalization, surgery, morbidity, and mortality) for
annual cases of patients hospitalized with unruptured intracranial aneurysms in the United States is
$522,500,000 compared with $1,755,600,000 for patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Conclusions: These data underscore the need to better understand unruptured intracranial aneurysm as
a risk factor for subarachnoid hemorrhage, to define other subarachnoid hemorrhage risk factors, and to
optimize the management of patients with these conditions. (Stroke 1992;23:1416-1419)
KEY WORDS · cerebral aneurysm · epidemiology · subarachnoid hemorrhage
Several factors underscore the observation that
unruptured intracranial aneurysms constitute a
significant and growing public health problem.
First, intracranial aneurysms are common in the gen-
eral population.1-6 Several large autopsy studies have
reported a wide range for overall frequency of intracra-
nial aneurysms, defined as a saccular dilatation of an
arterial wall that measures 2 mm or more. The frequency
range at autopsy had been 0.2-9.9%, with a mean of
approximately 5%, suggesting that among the United
States population alone, approximately 11 million per-
sons have or will have intracranial aneurysms. Second,
the mean age of the population is increasing, and intra-
cranial aneurysms appear to develop with increasing
age.7 The incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage from
an intracranial aneurysm also increases progressively
with age.8 Finally, in recent years, the widespread use of
computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging
head scans as well as magnetic resonance angiography910
has greatly increased the capacity for noninvasive and
incidental diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms.
We sought in this study to document the magnitude of
the problem of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in
the United States.

stay nonfederal hospitals in the 50 states and the
District of Columbia. We reviewed the data for the
years 1979, 1984, and 1989. In 1979 and 1984, the face
sheet and medical summary of sampled medical records
were the source documents for the data used in the
survey.1112 In 1989, a third of the hospitals in the survey
submitted data in machine-readable form.13 During this
period, the information was coded according to the
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
(ICD-9).14 Patients with primary or secondary diag-
noses of unruptured intracranial aneurysm were used in
this study (ICD-9 code 437.3). Cost estimates for this
analysis included the direct costs of hospitalization
(estimated at $1,200 per day for an average of 14 days
per patient) and the cost of surgery for those who had
surgery (estimated at $11,000). Length of hospital stay
estimates were derived from NHDS data, with separate
determinations for patients with subarachnoid hemor-
rhage and those with unruptured intracranial aneurysm
as the primary diagnosis. The frequency of surgery was
estimated at 35% of patients hospitalized based on the
usual practice of 40 centers in the United States,
according to a questionnaire survey conducted in 1989.
The cost of morbidity was expressed both in terms of
lost income and the cost of disability, and morbidity was
described for three age groups: <45 years old, 45-64
years, and >65 years. Patients in group 1 had an
estimated survival of 25 years; patients in group 2, 15
years; and patients in group 3, 5 years. The morbidity
was based on an operative morbidity figure of 6%,
which is compatible with prior clinical series reporting
operative morbidity and mortality for unruptured intra-
cranial aneurysms.15"21 Severe disability from surgery
was estimated at 4% and mortality at 3%.15"21 The lost
income from disability and mortality was calculated as

$14,000 per year, and the disability cost from severe
disability was calculated as $20,000 per year.
For comparison, the cost of aneurysmal subarachnoid
hemorrhage was calculated in a similar manner by using
primary or secondary diagnoses of subarachnoid hem-
orrhage (ICD-9 code 430) from NHDS data. The overall
number of cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage was mul-
tiplied by 0.75 because as many as 25% of patients with
subarachnoid hemorrhage may have another source,
such as an arteriovenous malformation or an unknown
source. Direct hospital costs were estimated as $1,500 a
day for a mean of 18 days, and an estimated 25% of
patients underwent surgical clipping.822 For the costs of
morbidity and mortality, the same age groups of pa-
tients were used with estimates of overall morbidity,
including operative morbidity of 6%, 12%, and 23.4%
for age groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and serious
disability of 4% in all age groups.23 Overall mortality by
group was estimated at 15%, 28%, and 44%, respec-
tively, based on prior results from the Cooperative
Aneurysm study23 and population-based experience.8
The number of patients by age group with unruptured
and ruptured aneurysms was based on prior clinical
series.7.24-25
Results
Figure 1 illustrates the numbers of patients with
subarachnoid hemorrhage, unruptured intracranial an-
eurysms, and aneurysmal clipping according to NHDS
data for the years 1979, 1984, and 1989. Tables 1 and 2
reflect the economic impact of unruptured intracranial
aneurysms and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage,
respectively.
We used a conservative estimate of 10,300 patients
hospitalized annually with unruptured intracranial aneu-
rysm, which reflects the mean of the 1979,1984, and 1989
survey years. The estimated lifetime cost for annual cases
of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms hos-
pitalized in the United States is $522,500,000, including
hospitalization, surgery, morbidity, and mortality. The
analogous figure for patients with aneurysmal subarach-
noid hemorrhage in the United States is $1,755,600,000
for annual cases (Figure 2).

Discussion
The NHDS data subsequent to 1989 were not
available at the time of this study. Although ongoing
technological developments such as high-resolution
magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance angiog-
raphy are providing much more powerful tools for
making the diagnosis of unruptured intracranial aneu-
rysms as small as 3 mm in diameter,9 the impact of
these technologies may not be fully reflected in NHDS
data. Because only hospitalized patients are included
in the NHDS, these data undoubtedly underestimate
the impact of patients with unruptured intracranial
aneurysms. This underestimation may be more pro-
nounced in the future if more patients are studied and
followed with outpatient technologies.
An additional consideration regarding the impact of
unruptured intracranial aneurysms involves patients
with future rupture from undipped aneurysms. Such
patients would be included in subsequent NHDS data
under the classification of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
The overall cost for these subsequent ruptures is esti-
mated at $181,100,000 based on rupture rates of 2% per
year and current cost estimates, as presented in "Sub-
jects and Methods." This number suggests that approx-
imately 1/10 of the impact of subarachnoid hemorrhage
derives from previously identified unruptured intracra-
nial aneurysms.
Because this study is predicated on several assump-
tions, a sensitivity analysis was conducted by varying
several parameters, including incidence rates, morbidity
and mortality from surgery and subarachnoid hemor-
rhage, surgical rates, length of hospital stay, and life
expectancy, to illustrate the effect such variation would
have on the total cost estimates (Table 3).
Despite convincing evidence for an overall decrease
in stroke rates from 1945 to 1984,26 there has been no
apparent change in incidence or age at onset of sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage from 1945 to 1984. Although
mortality from subarachnoid hemorrhage showed a
decreasing trend for this period,27 the change was only
marginally significant. The lack of significant declines in
incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage relates at least
in part to an inability to identify and properly manage
risk factors. Unruptured intracranial aneurysm consti-
tutes the most definitive risk factor for subarachnoid

delineate the relation of this risk factor and other
cerebrovascular risk factors to subsequent aneurysmal
rupture and to optimize the management of patients
with these conditions.
