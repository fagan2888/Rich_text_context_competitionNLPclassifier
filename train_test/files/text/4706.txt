Article
One of the oldest humor theories claims that humor is a form
of aggression (e.g., Hobbes, 1950). Support for this theory
has been found for cartoons (e.g., Byrne, 1956). People seem
to find aggressive cartoons funnier than non-aggressive ones.
One of the strongest pieces of evidence for this effect was
presented by McCauley, Woods, Coolidge, and Kulick
(1983) in a series of six studies. They found that participants
rated aggressive cartoons as funnier than non-aggressive
ones regardless of participants' demographics (children, stu-
dents, adults, native vs. foreign born, socioeconomic status)
andthestudymaterialused(differentcartoonsets).McCauley
and colleagues (1983) correlated the mean rankings of the
aggressiveness of a certain set of cartoons (rated by one
group of participants) with the mean rankings of the funni-
ness of the same set of cartoons (rated by a different group of
participants) and found a strong positive correlation.
Although further replications found some support for the
connection between humor and aggressive or disparaging
content in cartoons (Zillmann, 1983), other studies failed to
do so (Deckers & Carr, 1986), and yet others have found
negative correlations (Love & Deckers, 1989). This incon-
sistency suggests that there may be other factors (e.g., indi-
vidual differences) influencing the connection between the
aggressiveness and funniness of cartoons.
Indeed, some studies have found individual differences in
the described effect. Women judged sexist cartoons to be less
funny, regardless of how aggressive the cartoons were (Love
& Deckers, 1989). Boys and girls who rated violent cartoon
films as funnier also had higher scores on neuroticism, psy-
choticism, sensation seeking, and a higher sensitivity to
reward (but not to punishment; Aluja-Fabregat &
Torrubia-Beltri, 1998). When using ratings of painfulness
instead of aggression, men were found to rate painful car-
toons as funnier (low positive correlation), whereas women
were found to rate them as less funny (medium negative cor-
relation; Barrick, Hutchinson, & Deckers, 1990). Although
some of these studies used slightly different methods (e.g.,
Aluja-Fabregat & Torrubia-Beltri, 1998) compared with the
original study by McCauley and colleagues (1983), more
recent research suggests that the effect of aggressiveness on
humor in cartoons is not as general as has been proposed, but
may be moderated by individual differences (see also La
Gaipa, 1968; Prerost, 1983).
The aim of the present study was to replicate the findings
of the parent study of McCauley and colleagues (1983) and
to further examine possible moderating effects. The follow-
ing adjustments were made: (a) a larger sample size (n > 100)
was obtained than in the initial studies by McCauley and col-
leagues (1983; median = 20), resulting in higher statistical
power; (b) participants had to also rate cartoons for painful-
ness, which has been found to have a higher variability than
aggression ratings, leading to a more reliable correlation
with funniness (Deckers & Carr, 1986); (c) funniness may
also have something to do with the intelligence of the punch

Are Aggressive Cartoons Really Funnier?
A Replication
Stefan Stieger1,2 and Anton K. Formann2,
Abstract
Research has found that more aggressive cartoons are perceived as funnier. The current study (N = 106; 16 cartoons)
examined this finding in more detail by additionally including painfulness and cleverness rankings of cartoons, and by examining
possible moderating effects of different humor styles, self-esteem (explicit, implicit), and social desirability. Aggressive or
painful cartoons were not perceived to be funnier, but were rated as having a cleverer punch line. Effects were only weakly
correlated with participants' humor styles, but were independent of self-esteem and social desirability. This suggests that
aggressive cartoons are not in general perceived to be funnier than non-aggressive ones, and that there may be other
moderators influencing this effect (e.g., the type of cartoons, definition of aggression and funniness, cultural aspects).

line; participants, therefore, also rated cartoons for their clev-
erness; (d) a within-subject design was implemented (in con-
trast to McCauley et al., 1983), where each participant ranked
cartoons on all four dimensions (i.e., aggressiveness, funni-
ness, cleverness, painfulness); (e) the order of administration
of the four rankings was varied (i.e., four different pre-ran-
domized orders), which allowed us to control for series
effects (i.e., participants ranking cartoons for aggression may
be reluctant to admit that they also find them funny; for
example, Gollob & Levine, 1967).
To examine individual differences, measures of explicit
(i.e., conscious, deliberate) and implicit (i.e., automatic,
habitual) self-esteem and a measure of humor styles were
administered because their correlation with humor has con-
sistently been reported in past studies (e.g., Kuiper & Martin,
1993; Martin, Puhlik-Doris, Larsen, Gray, & Weir, 2003;
Stieger, Formann, & Burger, 2011). For example, individuals
using affiliative humor (e.g., telling jokes to amuse others) or
self-enhancing humor (e.g., having a humorous outlook on
life) tend to have higher self-esteem compared with individ-
uals using aggressive humor (e.g., sarcasm, teasing) or self-
defeating humor (e.g., amusing others by saying denigrating
things about oneself). Therefore, a possible hypothesis would
be that individuals using positive humor styles, such as affili-
ative or self-enhancing humor, will find aggressive cartoons
less funny, whereas individuals using negative humor styles,
such as aggressive or self-defeating humor, will find aggres-
sive cartoons funnier. Furthermore, when individuals rank
cartoons both on humor and aggression, these rankings could
be in danger of being influenced by impression management
or social desirability concerns. Therefore, a measure of social
desirability was additionally included.
Method
Participants
Participants (N = 106; 51 men) were mainly from Austria
(83%; Germany 17%) and had a mean age of 29.3 years (SD
= 11.6; range = 14-69 years).
Measures
Cartoon ranking task.Eighteen cartoons were randomly
selected from a single cartoonist (www.nicht-lustig.de). A
single cartoonist was explicitly used to avoid influences
from different cartoon characteristics, for example, color
versus black-and-white and fictitious physiques versus real
humans or animals. The cartoons were checked for their
appropriateness (e.g., variation in aggressiveness) by the
authors and research assistants, which resulted in the exclu-
sion of two cartoons. Finally, 16 cartoons were used for the
study. Cartoons were color-printed, laminated, and num-
bered on the back. Participants had to rank all cartoons from
1 to 16 in descending order (without ties) according to
funniness, aggressiveness, painfulness, and cleverness,
respectively. Except for the funniness ranking, all ranking
tasks were accompanied with a definition to prevent ambigu-
ity--Aggressiveness: "Are the cartoon figures showing
aggressive facial expressions or gestures? Are they acting
aggressively (i.e., provocation) or are they forcing someone
to do something?" Painfulness: "Is there any physical and
emotional harm as a consequence of violence of the comic
figures against others or themselves?" Cleverness: "How
surprising or clever is the punch line?".
Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ). The 32-item HSQ (Martin
et al., 2003; German form: Stieger et al., 2011) assesses four
styles of humor: affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, and
self-defeating humor ( = .85, .73, .72, .72) using a 7-point
Likert-type scale (1 = totally disagree; 7 = totally agree).
Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES).The RSES (Rosenberg,
1965; German form: von Collani & Herzberg, 2003) is a
10-item measure of explicit self-esteem using a 4-point Lik-
ert-type scale (0 = totally disagree; 3 = totally agree;  =
.78).
Initial preference task (IPT). With the IPT (Kitayama & Kara-
sawa, 1997), participants rated the letters A to Z on a 7-point
Likert-type scale (1 = I don't like at all; 7 = I like). Individu-
als rate their initial name letters superior to non-name letters
(i.e., name­letter effect). This effect has been proposed as a
measure of implicit (i.e., automatic, unconscious, habitual)
self-esteem. As recommended, a duplicate administration
was used and the name­letter effect was calculated sepa-
rately for the first and last name initial (Stieger, Voracek, &
Formann, 2012). To control for possible series effects, four
pre-randomized lists of letters were used (r
tt,first name
= .82;
r
tt,last name
= .77).
Social Desirability Scale­17 (SDS-17).The SDS-17 (Stöber,
2001) comprises 17 items with a true/false response format
( = .76) and is a widely used scale for measuring social
desirability.
Procedure
Several research assistants recruited participants from the
general population through their personal contacts (e.g.,
friends, relatives) and by word-of-mouth, resulting in a com-
munity-based sample. After a brief instruction, participants
performed the cartoon ranking tasks (each participant was
assigned to one of the four pre-randomized different orders),
followed by the first administration of the IPT, then a second
cartoon ranking task, the SDS-17, RSES, HSQ, third cartoon
ranking task, the second administration of the IPT, and
finally the fourth cartoon ranking task followed by basic
demographic questions (sex, age, nationality, initial letter of
first and last name).

Analysis
Following the procedure of McCauley and colleagues (1983),
the median ranks for aggressiveness, funniness, painfulness,
and cleverness were calculated separately for each cartoon
(i.e., analysis on cartoon level). Next, Spearman rank-order
correlations were computed for these median ranks for all of
the four ranking dimensions (see Table 1).
For the analyses of individual differences, all rankings of
each participant were correlated with each other, thus result-
ing in six Spearman rank-order correlations (i.e., analysis at
the participant level). These correlations were transformed to
Fisher's z prior to analysis. Funniness­cleverness and
aggressiveness­painfulness correlations were excluded from
further analyses because they were not central to the research
question. IPT effects were calculated separately for the first
and last name initial (Stieger et al., 2012) using the recom-
mended I algorithm (LeBel & Gawronski, 2009).
Results
Cartoon Characteristics: Are Aggressive Cartoons
Funnier?
Order of rankings had no effect onto correlations (all Fs <
1.72, all ps > .17) and was therefore not considered in the
following analyses. The cartoons showed large variance
regarding their mean ranks on funniness (funniest cartoon =
4.8, least funniest cartoon = 10.5), aggression (most aggres-
sive = 5.3, least aggressive = 13.4), painfulness (most painful
= 3.3, least painful = 13.6), and cleverness (most clever =
5.5, least clever = 10.5). So in every category, there was a
clear tendency toward the most and least funny, aggressive,
painful, and clever cartoon (all Kruskal­Wallis tests: p <
.001). This suggests that the used cartoons were heteroge-
neous enough on aggressiveness, funniness, painfulness, and
cleverness to establish effects.
The assumed rationale that aggressive cartoons are per-
ceived as funnier (McCauley et al., 1983) was not replicated
(Table 1). In addition, painfulness rankings, which have been
suggested as a more appropriate measure (Deckers & Carr,
1986), were not correlated with funniness.1 As expected, car-
toons that were perceived to be cleverer were also perceived
as funnier, and more aggressive cartoons were found to be
more painful. Interestingly, cartoons that were rated as being
cleverer were also rated as more aggressive and more pain-
ful. This can be interpreted as mild support for the hypothesis
of McCauley and colleagues (1983), insofar as more aggres-
sive (which may be similar to painful) cartoons were also
perceived as being cleverer (which may be similar to
funniness).
Person Characteristics: Is the Effect Moderated
by Individual Differences?
Order of rankings had no impact on the present study's vari-
ables (all Fs < 1.91, all ps > .13) and Spearman rank-order
correlations were not sex-specific (all |ts| < 1.16, p > .25).
Hence, the following analyses were not separated for differ-
ent orders of rankings and participant sex.
There was high variability within Spearman rank-order
correlations (range = -.60 to 1.00), suggesting that individ-
ual differences may have had an influence on the basic effect
on the cartoon level, which was anticipated based on past
research results. Out of 36 possible moderating effects tested
(see Table 2), only two significant correlations were found
(both for the self-enhancing humor style). Participants with
higher self-enhancing humor found painful cartoons funnier
but aggressive cartoons less funny.
Discussion
The effect that aggressive cartoons are funnier was not repli-
cated in the present study, even though the design used had
higher statistical power than the initial studies (McCauley et
al., 1983), insofar as we used 5 times more participants (N =
106 vs. n
mean
= 20) and 45% more cartoons (n = 16 vs. n
mean
= 11). Our results corroborate those of Deckers and Carr
(1986), who also did not find a significant correlation (r =
.22, ns) when using a different set of cartoons than McCauley
and colleagues (1983). Furthermore, Deckers and Carr
(1986) found an effect with painfulness (r = .30, p < .05),
although of much lower size than the aggressiveness correla-
tion of McCauley and colleagues (1983; r
mean
= .65, range =
.49-.90). Again, this effect could not be replicated with the
current study. What was found instead were significant cor-
relations between cleverness and painfulness, as well as
between cleverness and aggression. Cleverness was defined
by the question "How surprising or clever is the punch line?"

which is very similar to funniness. Thus, the aggressiveness­
funniness relationship found by McCauley and colleagues
(1983) could be reinterpreted as an aggressiveness­clever-
ness or painfulness­cleverness relationship.
Thus, the basic effect does not seem to be as general as
reported (McCauley et al., 1983). Moreover, it must be noted
that research on the topic lacks exact definitions and clear
demarcations of what is meant by aggressiveness, funniness,
painfulness, or cleverness. Aggression (e.g., verbal aggres-
sion, physical aggression) and funniness (e.g., duration of
laughing, surprise of the punch line; see Martin, 2007) are
both broad concepts that can be operationalized in many dif-
ferent ways.
Furthermore, a number of general humor theories propose
that individuals prefer jokes or cartoons in which the target
person is unaffiliated (i.e., a member of a social out-group
rather than an in-group member; see Ferguson & Ford,
2008). The current study entirely used fictional cartoon fig-
ures. Thus, it may have been that participants did not per-
ceive the cartoon figures as group members at all (neither
in-group nor out-group).
Furthermore, regarding Ruch's factor-analytical investi-
gations, three types of humor can be classified: incongruity-
resolution humor (i.e., classical humor), nonsense humor
(e.g., Gary Larsen cartoons), and sexual humor (see Martin,
2007). McCauley et al.'s cartoons were rather of the first
type, whereas our cartoons were of the second type, which
could also be the reason for the nil effect.
Another possibility could be related to the social percep-
tion of the cartoon figures. Gutman and Priest (1969) found
that jokes from socially acceptable aggressors were per-
ceived as funnier than jokes from socially unacceptable ones.
This also applies to the victim of the joke, but the rationale is
switched. Jokes about socially unacceptable victims are
found to be funnier (i.e., "deserves" the aggression; Gutman
& Priest, 1969) than jokes about socially acceptable victims.
Although these results only apply to jokes and not cartoons,
it could be that participants in the present study did not judge
the cartoon figures in relation to social acceptability at all,
because cartoon figures were fictional. This may have low-
ered the chances of detecting a possible funniness­aggres-
sion link.
Finally, although we avoided using cartoons from differ-
ent cartoonists, the cartoons we used nevertheless differed in
several respects that we did not control for. For example,
having a look at the cartoons from nichtlustig.de, some are
scatological, others are cute or represent dark humor, some
involve animals, and some only humans. We judged the car-
toons used on these dimension and found that none of them
had scatological phrases or can be regarded as "cute." One
cartoon can be regarded as representing dark humor, six
depicted only animals, and five showed animals as well as
humans. Although post hoc analyses were not possible
because of the too low sample size, future research might try
to take further moderating cartoon characteristics into
account.
From the individual perspective, only the self-enhancing
humor style showed significant correlations. Interestingly,
participants with a self-enhancing humor style found painful
cartoons funnier, but aggressive cartoons less funny. Self-
enhancing humor is characterized by generally humorous
outlook on life and maintaining a humorous perspective even
in the face of stress and hardship (Martin et al., 2003). This
humor style is positively associated with openness to experi-
ence, self-esteem, and psychological well-being, and repre-
sents a positive form of humor (contrary to the negative
forms such as aggressive and self-defeating humor styles).
This might be the reason why participants with this humor
style did not judge aggressive cartoons as funnier. In the
same vein, these participants also judged painful cartoons as
funnier. Aggressiveness was defined as violent or aggressive
acts against others whereas painfulness was defined as harm
to others or oneself. So aggressiveness was clearly defined as
other-related, whereas painfulness was unspecific about the
target. Although this rationale sounds reasonable, it should
be treated with caution because correlations were weak and

only these 2 of our 36 correlations reached statistical signifi-
cance. Thus, the uncovered results may also reflect a statisti-
cal Type I error.
Although the uncovered results are mainly nil findings,
this study adds to the current literature in two respects. First,
aggressive cartoons may be not as funny as has been pro-
posed and, second, although the high variability within cor-
relations proposes individual differences, this variability
may be rather due to other potential variables (e.g., type of
cartoons, definitions of aggression).

Note
1. It is reasonable to assume that the relationship between aggres-
siveness and funniness might be not linear, but rather inversely
U shaped. Overly aggressive cartoons might be experienced
as too extreme, which in return reduces their funniness again.
Indeed, a curve estimation analysis found that a quadratic
model explains more variance than a linear model (R2
linear
<
.01; R2
quadratic
= .14), but both models were still not significant
(F < 1.07, p > .37).
