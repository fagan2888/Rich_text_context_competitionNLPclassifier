Abstract
Objectives: To investigate paraoxonase-1 (PON1
) lactonase activity, myeloperoxidase (MPO)
activity (as a marker of inflammation) and antioxidant status in plasma of patients with type 1
diabetes mellitus.
Methods: Whole blood and plasma samples were collected from patients with diabetes and
healthy control subjects. PON1
lactonase and MPO activities and total antioxidant capacity (TEAC)
were determined in plasma. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was quantified in whole blood.
Results: Plasma PON1
lactonase and MPO activities were significantly higher and TEAC was
significantly lower in patients with diabetes (n ¼ 18) compared with healthy control subjects
(n ¼ 20). There were significant positive correlations between PON1
lactonase activity and MPO
activity and HbA1c level, and plasma MPO and HbA1c. There were significant negative correlations
between PON1
lactonase activity and TEAC, and MPO activity and TEAC.
Conclusions: Increased lactonase activity may inefficiently compensate for the high level of
chronic inflammation and low antioxidant capacity in the plasma of patients with type 1 diabetes
mellitus.

Introduction
The paraoxonase (PON) family comprises
three enzymes (PON1
, PON2
and PON3
)
with structural homology and common
antioxidant properties.1 PON1
has been
widely studied due to its anti-atherogenic
function and role in cardiovascular disease.1
The enzymatic activities of PONs include
paraoxonase, arylesterase and lactonase,
which catalyse the hydrolysis of organo-
phosphates, aromatic esters and lactones,
respectively.2 Alterations in circulating
PONs (for example, the concentration and
activity of PON1
) have been reported in a
variety of diseases involving oxidative stress,
including diabetes mellitus.3
Chronic inflammation is common in
patients with type 1 diabetes,4 manifesting
as elevated inflammatory markers,5 immune
activation6 and oxidative stress.7,8 These
factors are strongly associated with the
initiation and progression of atherosclerosis
and cardiovascular disease.9 Plasma myelo-
peroxidase (MPO) is a valuable marker of
chronic inflammation, endothelial dysfunc-
tion and cardiovascular disease.10
Diabetes is associated with high levels of
oxidative stress and damage.11 Antioxidant
systems are major mechanisms for protect-
ing cells from oxidative stress-induced
damage, and imbalances in the redox mech-
anism may contribute to the pathogenesis or
complications of diabetes mellitus.12,13
There is conflicting information regarding
the antioxidant status of patients with dia-
betes, however.14,15
In spite of a lack of information regard-
ing PON1
lactonase activity in patients with
type 1 diabetes, its aryl esterase and para-
oxonase activities are known to be
decreased.16,17 Factors including increased
oxidative stress and protein glycation have
been found to be at least partially respon-
sible for these changes.3
The aim of the present study was to
investigate PON1
lactonase activity, plasma
MPO (as a marker of inflammation) and
antioxidant status of patients with type 1
diabetes.
Patients and methods
Study population
This case­control study recruited sequential
patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus
(defined according to criteria of the
American Diabetes Association18) undergo-
ing treatment at the NC Paulescu National
Institute of Diabetes, Nutrition and
Metabolic Diseases, Bucharest, Romania,
between January 2011 and January 2012.
Patients were examined for specific chronic
complications of diabetes, including micro-
angiopathy, macroangiopathy and hyper-
tension. Exclusion criteria for all study
participants were: acute hyperglycemia
crisis; inflammatory or infectious disease;
active liver disease; acute vascular disease;
current immunosuppressive therapy; and
vitamin C or E supplementation. All
patients were receiving subcutaneous insulin
for glycaemic control, with a target glyco-
sylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of <7%.
Healthy staff members were recruited as
volunteers and included as control subjects.
No attempt was made to age- or sex-match
the control population.
The study was approved by the ethics
committee of the NC Paulescu National
Institute of Diabetes, Nutrition and
Metabolic Diseases, Bucharest, Romania.
Written informed consent was obtained
from all study participants.
Plasma preparation
All participants provided peripheral blood
samples after an overnight fast. Blood (5 ml)
was collected into sterile tubes containing
34 IU lithium heparin and centrifuged at
548 Â g for 15 min at 4C. The resulting
plasma was placed on ice prior to storage at
524 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
À80C until further analysis. Plasma was
used for the assay of PON1
, MPO and total
antioxidant activity. HbA1c was quantified
in whole blood (2 ml) collected into
sterile tubes containing potassium­EDTA
(1.2­2.0 mg EDTA/ml of blood).
Sample analysis
All assays were performed on a Perkin-
Elmer Lambda EZ 210 spectrophotometer
(Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA, USA), and
were carried out on duplicate samples.
Total protein was assayed via the
Bradford method (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA, USA). Optical density was
measured at 595 nm against a bovine serum
albumin standard curve.
Plasma PON1
lactonase activity was
determined using dihydrocoumarin
(DEPCyMC; Sigma-Aldrich Chemie,
Steinheim, Germany), as described previ-
ously,19 with absorbance measured at
270 nm. Enzymatic activity was expressed
as U/ml.
MPO activity was determined with the
o-dianisidine­hydrogen peroxide method.20
The change in absorbance was measured at
460 nm (" 11 300/mol per cm) for 5 min.
Results were expressed as units of MPO/
mg protein, with 1 unit of MPO defined as
the quantity of enzyme degrading 1 nmol
hydrogen peroxide/min at 25C.
Total antioxidant activity was deter-
mined using the 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetra-
methylchroman-2 carboxylic acid (Trolox)
equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC)
assay developed by Miller et al,21 with
modifications.22 Optical density (absorb-
ance) was read at 734 nm against 5 mmol/l
phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). The
percentage inhibition of absorbance (dir-
ectly proportional to antioxidant activity)
was calculated. The assay was calibrated
against a Trolox standard curve. Plasma
TEAC was expressed as mmol of Trolox
equivalent per litre of plasma.
Whole blood HbA1c was quantified by
standardized immunoturbidimetry (Cobas
IntegraÕ; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany) in accordance with the manufac-
turer's instructions.23
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as adjusted predictive
values based on a linear regression model,
using age as the independent variable. No
data imputations were performed. The data
were, therefore, corrected for age as a
potential confounder. Between-group differ-
ences were determined using parametric
(two-tailed Student's t-test) or nonpara-
metric (two-tailed Wilcoxon) tests. The
strength of association between pairs of
variables was assessed using Spearman
rank correlation analysis. Data analyses
were performed using InStat version 3
(GraphPad Software; La Jolla, CA, USA).
P-values <0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
The study included 18 patients with diabetes
(7 male/11 female; mean age 42.4 Æ 3.1
years; age range 18­59 years) and 20 healthy
control subjects (13 male/7 female; mean age
24.7 Æ 1.3 years; age range 17­41 years). The
demographic and clinical characteristics of
the participants are shown in Table 1.
Patients were significantly older and had
significantly higher HbA1c than controls
(P < 0.001 for both comparisons).
Data regarding plasma antioxidant cap-
acity and enzyme activities are shown in
Table 2. PON1
lactonase and MPO activities
were significantly higher and plasma TEAC
was significantly lower in patients than in
controls (P < 0.001 for each comparison).
In the patient group, there were signifi-
cant positive correlations between PON1
lactonase activity and MPO activity
(r ¼ 0.997, P < 0.0001) and HbA1c level
Savu et al. 525
(r ¼ 0.983, P < 0.0001), and MPO activity
and HbA1c (r ¼ 0.982, P < 0.0001). There
were significant negative correlations
between PON1
lactonase activity and
TEAC (r ¼ À0.968, P < 0.0001), and MPO
activity and TEAC (r ¼ À0.996, P < 0.0001).
Discussion
The present study identified increased levels
of PON1
lactonase activity and decreased
total antioxidant capacity in the plasma of
patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus com-
pared with healthy control subjects. The
TEAC assay is a validated, standardized
method for determining total antioxidant
capacity of a biological sample.24 Our data,
therefore, suggest defective antioxidant
function in type 1 diabetes despite apparent
upregulation of PON1
lactonase. It is pos-
sible that this may be due to the known
decrease in activity of PON1
when disso-
ciated from high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
to the lipoprotein-free serum fraction under
diabetic conditions.25 It has been shown that
the higher the concentration of glucose in
plasma from patients with diabetes, the
higher the rate of PON1
dissociation from
HDL.26
In vitro studies have found that that
various oxidative stress systems differen-
tially impair PON1
activities,27 and that
HDL-bound PON1
lactonase is less sensitive
than HDL-bound PON1
arylesterase in the
same specific oxidative environment.27
Similar data have been found in patients
with type 2 diabetes.28 PON1
lactonase
activity has also been shown to decrease
with higher carotid intima­media thickness,
suggesting that this enzyme is an independ-
ent risk factor for atherosclerosis in patients
with diabetes.28 Substrate availability may

also influence PON1
lactonase activity in
diabetes.29 Homocysteine and homocyst-
eine­thiolactone are natural substrates of
PON1
lactonase,30 and high homocysteine
concentrations are an independent
risk factor for cardiovascular disease.31
Homocysteine­thiolactone is a naturally
occurring metabolite of homocysteine in all
human cells, and may be responsible for its
deleterious effects.32 Clinical studies have
indicated that PON1
lactonase activity and
homocysteine levels vary in diabetes and
some metabolic diseases.33
Plasma MPO activity was also increased
in plasma from patients with diabetes com-
pared with control subjects in the present
study, and MPO activity was positively
correlated with HbA1c. This suggests that
diabetes is characterized by chronic inflam-
mation, in accordance with data showing the
importance of plasma MPO concentration
and chronic inflammation as predictors for
atherosclerosis progression in coronary dis-
ease.34,35 Studies have found that MPO
activity is a source of reactive oxygen species
(ROS),36 amplifying the ROS-induced
impairment of endothelium-dependent
relaxation via reduction of nitric oxide bio-
availability.37 Furthermore, MPO is a well
established inflammatory marker related to
endothelial dysfunction and coronary dis-
ease,10 and ROS are considered to be medi-
ators of chronic inflammation in diabetes.38
PON1
lactonase reduces lipid peroxides
and exhibits peroxidase-like activity.39 The
positive correlation between PON1
lacto-
nase activity, MPO activity and HbA1c in
our patients with type 1 diabetes therefore
suggests a protective role of PON1
in the
development of atherosclerosis, in accord-
ance with data indicating a role for PON1
in
the prevention of atherosclerosis and car-
diovascular disease.40 It could be speculated
that the increased peroxidase-like activity of
PON1
lactonase may reflect a compensatory
response against ROS overproduction gen-
erated by MPO activity.
There are several limitations of our study.
The incomplete evaluation of all activities of
PON1
results in limited characterization of
PON1
function in type 1 diabetes. The
quantification of homocysteine or homo-
cysteine­thiolactone would allow better
characterization of PON1
lactonase activity
or other activities, such as arylesterase.
Isolation of serum lipoproteins would
permit analysis of serum PON1
distribution
between HDL and lipoprotein-deficient
serum, and the comparison of PON1
bio-
logical functions in these fractions. This
study was also limited by its small sample
size, although this is more likely to bias the
results toward a negative finding (due to
insufficient statistical power) than a false-
positive result.
In conclusion, our study suggests that
increased lactonase activity may inefficiently
compensate for the high level of chronic
inflammation and low antioxidant capacity
in the plasma of patients with type 1
diabetes mellitus. This observation underlies
the antioxidant properties described previ-
ously in relation to the lactonase activity of
PON1
.
