Introduction
The Internet is revolutionizing interpersonal relations with
the availability and growing acceptance of online social net-
works. These networks provide rich and versatile platforms
for diverse interactions and sharing of information (Antoci,
Sabatini, & Sodini, 2013; Montesano, 2013). Youth from
different cultures subscribe and access all sorts of informa-
tion from these platforms. Through this process of network-
ing and information sharing, knowledge is developed and
possibly deployed as individuals or group members may
deem fit. These include acquiring and sharing of informa-
tion on health and other topical issues. The speed at which
information spread and the possible implications for indi-
viduals and society are overwhelming. As such, some coun-
tries have called for censoring and restricted access, and
some have argued in favor of unrestricted access (Warf,
2011). To the latter group, unlimited Internet access is indis-
pensable for information dissemination as it has the poten-
tial of promoting the health and well-being of different
social groups, especially the youth.
In terms of disease burden, young people are among the
most affected by the various social categories. A possible
implication is a need for self-care practices and searches for
health information, especially on socially stigmatizing con-
ditions, like sexual and mental health problems. This possi-
bility may become complicated by an established culture of
self-medication and poor health systems performance. Over
the decades, efforts have been made to address the poor
health performance as well as discourage self-medication as
a healthy practice. Despite these efforts, marginal achieve-
ments have been obtained, thereby calling for more attention
and understanding. Self-care practices (ability to purchase
prescribed drugs without a prescription sheet from a quali-
fied physician) are widespread among undergraduates in
Nigeria (Fadare & Tamuno, 2011; Osemene & Lamikanra,
2012). Against this backdrop, the possibility of abusing some
drugs remains high as shown in the abuse of antibiotics
(Fadare & Tamuno, 2011; Famuyiwa, Aina, & Bankole-Oki,
2011). Thus, this article investigates online health seeking
and its possible influence on decision making among
Nigerian undergraduates.
With the challenges of regulating and maintaining prompt
access to quality and trustworthy health information, there is
a need to focus on the implications of this development in
health care service delivery and consumption among young

Online Health Information Seeking
Pattern Among Undergraduates in a
Nigerian University
Oluwaseun I. Obasola1 and Ojo Melvin Agunbiade2,3
Abstract
Based on a cross-sectional design, this study investigates online health seeking and its possible influence on decision making
among 400 university undergraduates in Nigeria. From the results, it was found that daily Internet use was on the average
(33.7%), and use was constrained by the poor power supply, the high cost of the Internet access, and poor delivery of services.
Health information sought covers nutrition, fitness/exercise, HIV/AIDS, malaria, sore throat, mental health, menstrual pain,
and sexual/reproductive health. The majority (72.7%) who perceived available health information as accurate and dependable
had an opportunity to seek similar information on their health conditions from different online sources. A high proportion
(202) claimed that they consulted a physician after that, just a few (54) of the respondents consulted a traditional healer, and
a few others relied on self-medication (10%) or asked friends for suggestions (11%). Thus, there is a need to provide reliable
Internet connection and enlighten the Nigerian youth on criteria for assessing quality online health information.

people (Cline & Haynes, 2001; Minichiello, Rahman, Dune,
Scott, & Dowsett, 2013; Murero & Rice, 2013; Siliquini
et al., 2011). Similarly, improved access to health informa-
tion could also prompt help seeking from informal sources
and self-medication, depending on context and nature of
health or disease conditions. As a result, studies on where
individuals get health information and whether they use
online resources have become a major research focus in
recent times (Percheski & Hargittai, 2010). Nonetheless,
Kam, Stanszus, Cheah, Heerasing, and Yi Tie (2010) noted
that studies with a primary emphasis on the use of Internet by
university students as a source of health information are not
common. Hence, exploring the utilization of the Internet by
this unique group is important. Young people represent the
most active Internet users among all ages who are using the
platform daily for information seeking and communication
(Kim, Park, & Bozeman, 2011; Singh & Brown, 2014).
Nigeria, the most populousAfrican country, has a teeming
population of young people who are mobile phone users,
with increasing access to the Internet (Stork, Calandro, &
Gillwald, 2013). The Internet access and usage in Nigeria are
on the rise with the advent of telecommunication companies
providing wider access through mobile phones (Kadiri &
Alabi, 2014). With this development comes higher exposure
to different kinds of information, including those relating to
health and disease conditions (Amaugo, Papadopoulos,
Ochieng, & Ali, 2014). This article proceeds with a focus on
the relevant literature on online health seeking among youth.
The context through which empirical evidence was gener-
ated came next and was followed by a presentation of the
results. The discussion of the findings in relation to existing
knowledge on online health seeking was followed with the
conclusion.
Youth and the Use of the Internet for
Health Information
Online health information seeking has its benefits and short-
comings. Parts of the benefits include timeliness and a broad
range of information on specific and different health and dis-
ease conditions. Through this process, health information
becomes readily available in a way that patients' knowledge
becomes widened and relevant for more participation in ther-
apeutic relationships (Sillence, Briggs, Harris, & Fishwick,
2007). It could also promote the making of more informed
decisions and compliance with medications. However, online
access to health information also raises debates about the
quality, trustworthiness, and applicability of the enormous
volume of health information among different social catego-
ries (Cline & Haynes, 2001).
Escoffery et al. (2005) in a study among college students
in the United States showed that the use of the Internet
among students is rising. Specifically, the study showed that
more than 70% of the respondents had used online health
information, and more than 40% reported using it frequently.
This increase is similar to Kitikannakorn and Sitthiworanan's
(2009) findings among students in Thailand. In both studies,
about 70% of the students with access to online health infor-
mation sought information on general health, disease treat-
ment, and nutrition. Reasons for using the Internet include
easy access and availability of updated information. Youth's
involvement and active consumption of online health infor-
mation also reflected in Horgan and Sweeney's (2012) find-
ings in Ireland. The Horgan and Sweeney's (2012) study
showed that more than 66% of the students use the Internet
to search for health information on a specific illness, social
health fitness, and nutrition information. Shaikh, Shaikh,
Kamal, and Masood (2008) also indicated that 43.4% of the
students in Islamabad used the Internet for seeking health
information. In contrast, a survey in India by Birpreet,
Singh, and Kumar (2011) indicates a low (14%) usage of the
platform for health information, despite the number of stu-
dents using the platform for other things. Infrastructural
developments, availability of quality Internet access, and
ownership of the computer or mobile phones with the
Internet access accounted for significant variations in terms
of access. This is vital to improving Internet access, espe-
cially among rural dwellers. Beyond the structural con-
straints and benefits, the quality of health information,
adequacy, and trustworthiness remains paramount to the
information seeker and the society.
The quality of health information provided through the
Internet has emerged as a major issue, especially with the
growing rate of utilizing this platform for firsthand and
snappy information (Scott, Gilmour, & Fielden, 2008). This,
according to Birpreet et al. (2011), led to the evolution of the
Internet Healthcare Coalition (IHC), a group of private and
not-for-profit organizations regulating health care sites and
services on the Internet. Thus, there is a need for more stud-
ies on perceived usefulness and trustworthiness of the qual-
ity and quantity of health information that is accessible to the
youth, in particular, who are early adopters of new things,
including health information.
Available evidence indicates that access to the Internet is
increasing among tertiary institution students in Nigeria
(Ajuwon, 2015), Ghana (Owusu-Acheaw & Larson, 2015),
and South Africa (Oyedemi, 2012); yet, few studies have
examined online health seeking patterns among this category
of young people (Marful & Winter, 2015). In Nigeria, a few
exceptions of studies with similar focus exist (Ajuwon, 2003;
Nwagwu, 2007; Stork et al., 2013). Nonetheless, these stud-
ies did not focus on the patterns, quality, perceived trustwor-
thiness, and utilization of online health information in
making health-related decisions.
Hence, this study investigates the use of the Internet
among undergraduates in a Nigerian University. Particular
focus is on the use of the Internet as a source of health infor-
mation, the type of health information sought, and their per-
ceptions of the quality of online health information. Online
health seeking is becoming widespread among young people
Obasola and Agunbiade 3
in particular. This may have serious implications for well-
being and health outcomes, especially in social contexts
where health system performance is poor and self-medica-
tion is common. It is envisaged that this study would be valu-
able in the development of online health information
interventions that may better reach this group, as well as
address prevailing health information needs or challenges
among young people in Nigeria.
Method
With the use of a cross-sectional research design, the study
concentrated on undergraduate students at the University of
Ibadan, the premier university in Nigeria. Cross-sectional
design is useful in investigating online health information
seeking among students (Nwagwu, 2007). Attention was
purposively focused on recruiting male and female under-
graduates from cognate faculties. These were faculties where
students were exposed to courses with little or inadequate
information on health-related matters. The eight faculties
were arts, sciences, law, the social sciences, education, agri-
culture and forestry, technology, and veterinary medicine
(see Table 1 for details). The faculties excluded were public
health, pharmacy, clinical sciences, dentistry, and basic med-
ical sciences. Students from these colleges were deemed
more knowledgeable about health-related issues than those
in the other faculties included in this study.
Recruitment of survey participants involved word of
mouth and posting of handbills and posters in conspicuous
locations and lecture theaters within the eight targeted facul-
ties. The handbills and posters contained information on the
study objectives and contact details of the lead author. Also,
eight field-workers with relevant experience on the social
survey were trained with the research instrument for data
collection. The field-workers were undergraduates in the tar-
geted faculties, and they informed eligible study participants
about the research and the voluntariness of participation.
The available statistics on student population showed
that there were 11,036 undergraduate students in the eight
faculties (University of Ibadan, 2012). With the aim of focus-
ing on undergraduates with limited knowledge of health-
related matters, a nonprobability sampling technique was
adopted in the selection of 400 respondents. An average of
50 students was recruited from the eight faculties. The pur-
posive selection of the respondents helped in targeting a cat-
egoryofrespondentsfromthesamplingframe.Nonprobability
sampling approaches are compatible with cross-sectional
designs. In similar study populations, such sampling
approach has produced useful results from studies investigat-
ing health behaviors among undergraduates (Iliyasu,
Galadanci, Abubakar, Ismail, & Aliyu, 2012; Imaledo, Peter-
Kio, & Asuquo, 2013; Oppong & Oti-Boadi, 2013).
The data collection period was from January to March
2014. Voluntary participation of all respondents was sought
through verbal consent and filling of informed consent
forms. All the students were briefed on nature and purpose
of the study, and were encouraged to ask questions before
participation. Only those who were willing to participate
and gave their verbal and written consent were given cop-
ies of the questionnaire. Adequate time was taken to
explain to the respondents their right to withdraw from the
study, and that the result of the study had no personal
implications.
Data Collection
The survey instrument used in eliciting information from
students was anonymous, and it included detailed questions
about respondents' demographic characteristics, use of the
Internet, frequency of use of the platform, type of health
information sought, their assessment of online health infor-
mation, and decisions taken after accessing health informa-
tion online. The survey questions were based on evidence
from the literature and cues from previous studies that have
examined online health information seeking (Leung, 2008;
Yan, 2010). All the questions were close ended. The respon-
dents were asked to specify the frequency of use, quality of
health information sourced from the Internet, and the per-
ceived trustworthiness of the information, using a 4-point
scale with, 1 = unreliable, 2 = fairly reliable, 3 = very reli-
able, and 4 = accurate.
To ascertain the validity of the questionnaire, it was given
to experts in demography and statistics at the University of
Ibadan to review. Feedbacks from the reviewers were used to
improve the draft questionnaire. The questionnaire was also
pretested at another tertiary institution (the Polytechnic of
Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria) among 30 students. Based on the
findings from the pretest, some questions in the instrument
were adjusted to make them easy to complete. Using
Cronbach's alpha, a reliability coefficient was calculated for
the questionnaire, and a value of .71 was obtained. A total of
500 copies of the questionnaire were self-administered.
However, only 400 were found valid for the analysis. This
represents a response rate of 80%.

Data Analysis
The quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows
Version 17.0. Descriptive statistics, such as frequency counts,
percentages, mean, and standard deviation, were used to ana-
lyze the demographic details of the respondents. Using chi-
square, the bivariate analysis was focused on gender
differentials in terms of access to online health information,
the frequency of its use, perceived trustworthiness, and deci-
sions made about online health information.
Ethical Consideration
Voluntary participation of all respondents was sought through
verbal consent. All the students were briefed on nature and
purpose of the study, and were encouraged to ask questions
before participation. Only voluntary respondents who gave
both written and verbal consent were given the question-
naire. Adequate time was also taken to explain to the respon-
dents their right to withdraw from the study, and that the
result of the study had no personal implications.
Results
The age range of the 400 respondents was between 17 and 27
years. The average age of the respondents was 21.9 years.
Table 2 reveals that majority of the students were between
age 17 and 23 years. Less than 16% were above 27 years.
The predominant group among the respondents was the
second-year students (31.5%), and the least represented were
those in their final year (10.5%). A similar proportion of
males (48.8%) and females (57.7%) participated in the study.
The frequency of Internet use on a daily basis was on the
average (33.7%) when compared with those who access the
Internet for health-related information on a weekly basis
(22.2%) (see Table 2).
The frequency of the Internet use and volume of data
accessed per time depend on some factors. These include
structural factors, such as access to the computer system at
school or at home, availability of high-speed Internet Service
Providers, and affordability of the available services among
different social categories of students. With the relatively
low frequency of daily Internet access among the respon-
dents (as shown in Table 2), it was important to observe fur-
ther how sources of access influence the frequency of the
Internet use within the study population (see Table 3).
Ownership of a computer system or mobile phone with the
Internet access is an important determinant of the frequency
of use and the proportion of the time individuals allocate to
online information seeking. Among the respondents, 39.8%
claim having accessed the Internet in cybercafes. More than
50% of the respondents accessed the Internet through a per-
sonal computer (37%) and mobile phones (16.5%). Access to
the Internet through school was low, as only 6.8% (27) used
their school computer laboratory to access the platform.
Table 4 contains a summary of reported constraints to
Internet access. A probe into some of the prevailing con-
straints to frequent Internet access showed that 42% of the
respondents perceived the cost of the Internet access as a
major constraint. This was followed by epileptic power
(33%).
Furthermore, with the financial constraints on the Internet
access to the respondents, we probed further to understand
the implications regarding the volume of data accessible per
time. This is important for young people who would like to
engage in online activities, including seeking health-related
information. As contained in Table 5, more than 50% of the
respondents reported a bill of more than 1,000 Naira, an
average of US$6.5 to access data plan of about 200 megabits
on a mobile phone or personal computer system. Accessing
the Internet at cybercafes and the university's computer labo-
ratory provided the users more volume of data as against per-
sonal and mobile phones.
Figure 1 depicts the health information requested by the
respondents. The information covered included nutrition, fit-
ness/exercise, HIV/AIDS, malaria, sore throat, mental
health, menstrual pain, and sexual/reproductive health. The
most sought among the options mentioned by the respon-
dents is information about HIV/AIDS. A reasonable propor-
tion of the respondents also sought information on diet,
sexual/reproductive health, and mental health.
The Internet as a fountain of information also carries the
possibility of spreading adequate and inadequate health
information. This exposes health information seekers to the

benefits and dangers associated with the use of such informa-
tion. Hence, we assessed respondents' perceptions of the
quality of online health information accessed. Based on the
perceived usefulness and trustworthiness of online health
information, about 40% of the respondents considered infor-
mation sought as quite reliable. A similar proportion also felt
that the available information was accurate and dependable.
As shown in Table 6, the majority (72.7%) of the respondents
who perceived available health information as accurate and
reliable also had an opportunity to seek similar information
on their health conditions from different online sources. This
might have influenced their perception of the information
accessed. However, from a bivariate analysis, no significant
difference was observed between male and female respon-
dents about the perceived accuracy and dependability of
information sought.
Online health information seeking might not end at the
level of knowledge acquisition on a health need or lead to a
decision to seek help. As shown in Table 7, a high proportion
(202) of the respondents in this study claimed that they con-
sulted an orthodox physician because of the information
accessed online. Within this category of respondents, just a
slight variation was observed in the percentage of male
(48%) to female (52%) who consulted a physician after
accessing the needed information. Similarly, a fewer propor-
tion (54) of the respondents claimed consultation with a tra-
ditional healer owing to the information accessed. However,
there were those who did not consult a physician or a tradi-
tional healer but relied on self-medication or asked friends
for suggestions.
Discussion
Online health information seeking is growing wide among
youth, especially among those in colleges and other higher
institutions of learning. Access to timely and relevant health
information is essential to develop healthy practices that
could improve health outcomes. This makes it necessary to
investigate the sources of access, constraints to access, and
health reasons for seeking online information, trustworthi-
ness, and decisions associated with accessed health
information.
Access to the Internet is widespread among the respon-
dents in this study. This might be associated with the fact that
all the respondents in this study were university undergradu-
ates. At this level of study and with growing availability of
personal computer system and mobile phones with Internet
facilities, it is expected that a somewhat high rate of access

may exist. This aligns with findings from previous studies in
Nigeria (Ajuwon, 2003; Amassoma, Ayanda, & Tijani, 2010;
Ayanbadejo, Sofola, & Uti, 2008). However, this may not be
an actual representation of the Internet access among univer-
sity students in Nigeria. The University of Ibadan, where the
study was conducted, is the premier university and located in
an urban area of Oyo State, Nigeria. This provides a privi-
leged position that may be different from other universities
in Nigeria, especially those located in rural areas or areas
where the level of infrastructure is far below what is obtained
at the University of Ibadan.
There are initiatives to improve Information and
Communications Technology in all state-owned tertiary
institutions in Nigeria (Ani, 2010; Apulu, Latham, &
Moreton, 2011). Quality and affordable Internet access
remains a challenge for many students in Nigeria (Ani,
2010). This problem has existed for decades as shown by the
poor state of infrastructure in Nigerian universities. With the
possible health implications, it would be encouraging to see
a reduction in access cost and an increase in quality of the
Internet access. This will also improve the knowledge base
of Nigerian youth in general. However, as earlier stated, an
immediate concern is the poor performance of the health care
system and the porous monitoring of patent medicine ven-
dors in Nigeria (Osemene & Lamikanra, 2012). The study
indicated that more students accessed the Internet using per-
sonal computers, whereas only 16.4% accessed the platform
via mobile phones. In addition, more of the study partici-
pants accessed the Internet using cybercafes. This result
aligns with previous studies that have explored the use of the
Internet among Nigerian students (Ajuwon, 2003; Nwagwu,
2007). Findings from these studies also revealed that more
students accessed the platform via cybercafes. On the con-
trary, Stork et al.'s (2013) results showed increased access to
the Internet among young people in African countries via
mobile phones. With the growing base of mobile telecom-
munication subscribers in Nigeria, it is expected that under-
graduates in universities located in rural areas may enjoy the
Internet access as their counterparts in urban areas (Stork
et al., 2013). However, this depends on other factors, such as

ownership of a mobile phone with Internet facilities and abil-
ity to subscribe to an affordable data plan. This is indicated
in the results as the cost of the Internet access topped the list
of prevailing constraints to frequent Internet access; as a
result, more students accessed the Internet from cybercafes.
The frequency of the Internet use affects the quality of time
spent by online health information seekers on searching and
verifying information of interest. In this study, the rate of the
Internet access was somewhat low, as about one third of the
total respondents accessed the Internet on a daily basis. This
corroborates earlier studies which reported that cost, poor
Internet service delivery, and the need to attend to other things
could constrain the quality of time and access to the Internet,
especially among university students (Ani, 2010). The need
for regular physical contacts between the respondents and
their lecturers could also be a hindrance. This is because other
mediums of facilitating active learning are grossly lacking in
the study setting and the larger Nigerian society. With the pres-
ent way of promoting teaching in many Nigerian universities
(Ani, 2010), there are possibilities that lecture, assignments,
reading, and other activities might have increased the avail-
able time for online information search, as much time is
required when accessing a low-speed Internet service. While
mobile phone access to the Internet was an alternative source
for the respondents, fluctuations in services, limited Internet
features on low-cost mobile phones, and the cost of mobile
phone subscription may also influence or limit the kind of
activities that can be carried out on phones and the possibility
of balancing lecture time for flexible online health seeking.
It is noteworthy that the respondents in this study sought
online health information for different health conditions.
Among the females, the search for information on menstrual
disorder was dominant. This corroborates existing evidence on
the increasing prevalence of the disorder among young females
and the search for help from different sources, including the
Internet (Guvenc, Kilic, Akyuz, & Ustunsoz, 2012; Nair et al.,
2012). The situation is similar to other findings in the Nigerian
context (Iliyasu et al., 2012; Nwankwo, Aniebue, & Aniebue,
2010; Titilayo, Agunbiade, Banjo, & Lawani, 2010). Largely,
the search for information on sexual/reproductive health is
understandable as the respondents are in their reproductive
ages. The reliance on the Internet for sexual and reproductive
health Information portrays acceptability and the fruitfulness
the virtual space may have in addressing the sexual and repro-
ductive health challenges among young people in Sub-Saharan
Africa. As young people are sexually active, there are chances
of engaging in risky sexual practices that expose some of them
to infections that require more information to aid their decision
to seek help. Access to timely sexual and reproductive health
information is useful in several dimensions. It increases the
young people's participation in protecting and promoting their
sexual and reproductive health as well as becoming more
informed about the consequences of their actions and inactions.
The association of sexually transmitted infections with stigma
may also be influencing the need for information in a manner
that protects the identity of the information seeker. However,
there is a need for caution, as the availability of sexual and
reproductive health information through the Internet does not
imply a substitute for seeking help from health facilities in the
event of any infection. This is necessary especially in social
settings where the practices of self-medication and stigma are
associated with treating sexually transmitted infections.
Furthermore, a significant dimension of the findings in
this study is the use of information sought in reaching a deci-
sion. As stated earlier, this represents a level of confidence in
the information, which portrays danger, as many of the
respondents relied on verification of the information sought
through various online sources, which may not be from pro-
fessional physicians. From another position, the reliance on
several sources as a form of verification of available infor-
mation may be useful in empowering the respondents in tak-
ing informed decisions and being active when interacting
with their physicians. In the same vein, the possibility of
acquiring erroneous information can also hamper the quality
of relations in therapeutic interactions.
This article adds to the body of knowledge on online
health information seeking among young people in Nigeria
by focusing on the perceived dependability of the available
information and the associated implications for help seeking
from both formal and informal sources. The findings have
important implications for health information seeking among
young people in Nigeria. However, there are limitations in
generalizing the results to all youth, including those dwelling
in urban areas. The young people in this study were univer-
sity undergraduates who might differ from those outside the
university or in rural areas. The study is also limited by rely-
ing on quantitative data without generating qualitative infor-
mation that could have been useful in understanding how
context and health conditions influence the kind of informa-
tion being accessed and associated health decisions. Despite

the deficiencies in cross-sectional design, this approach pro-
vided an opportunity to elicit online health seeking among
university undergraduates with similar socioeconomic char-
acteristics. It assessed the possible implications of this prac-
tice for health practices and outcomes among this group of
youth and similar youth in other institutions of higher learn-
ing in the study setting.
Conclusion
The Internet access and use remain low among the study par-
ticipants. Compounding the situation are the poor power sup-
ply, the high cost of the Internet access, and poor delivery of
services. Existing constraints to the Internet access might
encourage quick check of health information without giving
adequate attention to cross-checking or verifying the authen-
ticity of the information from other sources. With the poor
access and urge to quickly surf the Internet for health-related
information, the chances are high that inadequate information
may be sought. This shortcoming may strengthen further the
practice of self-medication and delays in prompt health seek-
ing at formal sources. Furthermore, there is a need for practi-
tioners in the Nigerian health sector to take an active position
in providing timely and context-relevant information to the
growing need for online health information. This also affords
the sector an opportunity to take a lead position in regulating
and ensuring the availability of health-related information,
especially that which is related to locally common health con-
ditions. Such efforts will also complement existing initiatives
aimed at improving active participation of the Nigerian youth
in promoting and sustaining healthy practices.
