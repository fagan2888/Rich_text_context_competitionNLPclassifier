Bullying behavior continues to be a salient social and health-related issue of importance to educators, criminal justice practitioners,
and academicians across the country. While discourse on school bullying is abundant, previous studies are limited in explaining
the predictive effect of factors such as individual/demographic variables, school environmental variables, and school antibullying
preventive measures. Using a nationally representative sample of 12,987 private and public school students in the United States,
the current study examines school safety measures and students' perceptions about school environments (or climate), especially
school rules and punishment. Findings reveal that the variables of security guards, fairness and awareness of school rules, gangs
and guns at school, students misbehaving, and teachers' punishment of students were statistically significant predictors of bullying
victimization. Implications of these findings for school anti-bullying programs as well as directions for future research are discussed.
1. Introduction
In recent decades, school bullying and victimization, which
continues to be a serious social and health problem in the
United States, has received extraordinary levels of attention
from the public, criminal justice practitioners, academicians,
and educators [1­3]. A significant number of empirical stud-
ies indicate that bullying and victimization is an increasing
problem on school grounds and one that has negative conse-
quences for both bullies and their victims [3­8]. For example,
the School Crime Supplement survey (2007) showed that 32
percent of students reported being bullied at school, while
only 28 percent of students in 2005 reported being bullied
[9]. Recently, Dinkes et al. [10] found that 75 percent of US
public school principals indicated that schools reported one
or more violent incidents to the police, and 25 percent of
public schools reported school bullying on a daily/weekly
basis. Numerous studies [11­15] also document that school
bullying is physically and psychologically detrimental to the
victims.
Limited empirical studies [16­22] have examined pre-
dictors of bullying victimization, and few have focused on
individual and school-related factors. Yet these studies found
that individual demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, and
race) and school characteristics (e.g., presence of gangs at
school, and police/school staff members' supervision) are
significantly related to victimization. For example, a study
by DeVoe et al. [17] found that victims of school bullying
are more likely to be younger and white and to report the
presence of gangs in their schools.
Most previous research on bullying, however, suffers
from several limitations. First, the majority of prior research
has focused on bullies, types of bullying, and related pre-
vention/intervention strategies. Second, many studies have
focused on physically aggressive bullying and victimization
while ignoring psychologically/emotionally aggressive vic-
timization, despite the fact that many children are known
to be bullied not only physically, but also psychologi-
cally/emotionally [3, 23]. Third, while schools have attempted
to create safer environments by implementing a variety of
2 Journal of Criminology
preventive strategies and programs, such as the use of school
security technologies (e.g., metal detectors, and surveillance
cameras), school security guards, and anti-school-bullying
programs during the last decade, few studies have examined
whether these preventive strategies and technologies have any
significant effect on reducing bullying victimization [17, 22].
The current study, using a nationally representative
sample of adolescents in the United States, takes a more
holistic approach and addresses these limitations. Primarily,
the focus of the current study is to determine whether
various school safety strategies, the school environment, and
individual social demographic factors are significantly related
to each of the school bullying victimization categories. It is
hypothesized that students who attend schools where there is
a heightened safety outlook (including school safety strategies
for a more safe and protective school environment/climate)
will have less incidents of victimization than schools that
do not have such an environment. Additionally, this study
will examine three different categories of school bullying
victimization (physical, psychological, and both physical and
psychological bullying victimization) in an effort to help
schools develop more strategic plans for reducing bullying
and victimization.
1.1. School Bullying Victimization and Negative Consequences.
According to Olweus [13], school bullying is defined as
physical and/or emotional harm inflicted by students within
the geographical boundaries of a school campus. More often,
bullying includes repeated incidents of harm, is generally
characterized by an imbalance of power and/or an asym-
metrical relationship among students [7, 13], and harm is
directed at specific students (or targets) [24]. Victimization
(being bullied) of school bullying is therefore defined as
repeated exposure to physical and emotional harm from more
powerful students on campus [13].
Although the prevalence of victimization of school bul-
lying varies in empirical studies, prior research has found
that a significant number of children have been victims of
school bullying [13, 25­27]. For example, a study by Silvernail
et al. [26], using a sample of 4,496 youths in public schools,
found that 41 percent of students reported being teased in a
mean way and 38 percent reported being victims of physical
bullying (i.e., being hit, kicked, and/or pushed). Orpinas
et al. [25] found that almost half of the students in the
sample were victims of physical bullying and similar numbers
were emotionally and/or verbally bullied at school. More
recently, the 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Survey indicated that
approximately 8 percent of adolescents (aged 12­18 years)
in the sample were being threatened and injured by other
students. Overall, the results consistently report that our
children are victimized by other students on school ground.
A number of empirical studies have found that school
bullying has detrimental effects on a victim's physical and
psychological well-being and also hurts his/her academic
standing [7, 28­35]. For example, victims of school bullying
are more likely to suffer serious mental health disorders,
such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and unhappiness,
and are at greater risk for committing suicide [28, 33­35].
In addition, bullied victims are more likely to experience
relational problems with their school peers, to be rejected
by their peers, to dislike school, and to have lower grades
[7, 29, 33]. These findings clearly show that victimization
of school bullying is serious problem that requires changes
to school environments in order to improve safety among
students.
1.2. Predictors of School Bullying Victimization. Although
any student can be a victim of school bullying, there are
consistent characteristics of victims. Several empirical studies
have found that individual demographic characteristics (e.g.,
gender, age, and race) are significantly related to school
bullying victimization [16­18, 20, 21]. For example, Graham
and colleagues [18] and Rodkin and Berger [36] found that
girls are more likely than boys to be victimized at school
and to identify themselves as victims. Age and grade level
have also been found to be significant predictors of being
victimized [13, 16, 17]. A study by Whitney and Smith [21]
shows that risk of being bullied decreases with age. DeVoe
et al. [17] also found that 14 percent of 6th graders in the
sample reported being victimized, while only 2 percent of 12th
graders were victims of school bullying. Similarly, Olweus
[13] found that elementary and middle school students were
more vulnerable to victimization than high school students.
Regarding the relationship between race and school bullying
victimization, the findings are mixed. A study by Seals and
Young [37] indicates no significant difference between whites
and racial minorities, while Mouttapa et al. [38] found that
Asian youths were more likely than other racial groups being
victimized at school. Other studies [39­41] found that stu-
dents with mental health problems (e.g., anxiety, depression,
unhappiness, aggression, and emotional difficulties) appear
to be more vulnerable to school bullying victimization than
students without mental health problems.
Prior empirical studies also indicate that negative interac-
tions with parents and a home environment where domestic
violence is present are significantly related to school victim-
ization. Youths who have been rejected by parents and/or
exposed to a harsh home environment, such as hostility
and violence among family members, are more likely to be
victims of school bullying [42­45]. In addition to individual-
related characteristics, lifestyle and opportunity influence
bullying victimization. Adolescents who are more exposed to
opportunities to engage in risky behavior (e.g., skipping class
or getting involved in a fight) have a higher probability for
victimization than others.
Other studies [46­49] found that school characteris-
tics and climate (i.e., school conduct/discipline, teachers'
attitudes, teachers' support, rule clarity/enforcement, and
students' respect) are significant predictors of school vic-
timization. In contrast, adolescents attending schools where
teachers paid attention to bullying and intervened in or
stopped bullying problems were less likely to be victimized
[48].
Also, research shows a significant relationship between
school safety/adult supervision and bullying victimization
at school [49­51]. These studies found that students were
Journal of Criminology 3
less likely to be victimized when schools increased staff
supervision of student activities in hallways and in the
cafeteria. Additionally, students attending schools in which
teachers were aware of school policies on bullying and in
which school professionals handled victimization problems
adequately tended to be victimized less often [50]. In contrast,
lower levels of involvement by teachers in the establishment
and enforcement of policies on aggressive student behavior
were associated with higher rates of bullying and victimiza-
tion [52].
Gottfredson and his colleagues [53] reported on a mul-
tilevel study of the effects of the school climate on students'
victimization using a large national sample of secondary
schools from the National Study of Delinquency Prevention
in Schools. The researchers predicted that better discipline
management (i.e., perceptions of the fairness of school
rules/rule enforcement and perceptions of the clarity of rules)
is related to lower levels of student victimization. Results
from another study on the effects of school level security and
related issues on the degree of school bullying victimization
have been mixed. Schreck et al. [8] found no evidence
that school guardianship, such as school guards/hallway
supervision, metal detectors, and visitor sign-in protocols,
affected overall rates of students' victimization in school
once individual and school characteristics were controlled.
However, they found that students at schools with locker
checks and corporal punishment policies experienced less
victimization.
1.3. Theory of School Climate and School Bullying Victimiza-
tion. A few studies have focused on the role that the school
climate, including school characteristics, plays in bullying
victimization; most studies, however, overlook the ecological
dimension of school bullying and victimization although
framing school violence within this model is perhaps the
most cogent approach. Bronfenbrenner [54], in discussing a
more holistic perspective to human growth and development,
proposed an ecological model governed by the reciprocal
relationship an individual has with his/her environment.
Extrapolating from his theory, a few researchers have pro-
posed mechanisms of bullying victimization by employing
an ecological model whereby adolescent development is
influenced by both their proximal environment and other
environmental contexts including fluid interactions with
parents, peers, teachers, and the school climate [55, 56].
Bullying victimization can thus be best understood within
this framework.
The central features of ecological perspectives are four
different ecological levels of interaction: (i) microsystem;
(ii) mesosystem; (iii) exosystem; and (iv) macrosystem [54].
The microsystem involves interactions with the individ-
ual's immediate or proximal environment. The microsystem
includes patterns of activities, roles, and interpersonal rela-
tionships. Families are generally the first microsystem within
which adolescents function [54]. For instance, parents may
have the closest and the greatest influence on an adolescents'
behavior. The second ecological system is the mesosystem,
which refers to interrelations of two or more elements within
the microsystem. Harmonious relationships between parent
and peers or parents and school may influence an adolescent's
behavior. Thirdly, the exosystem is defined as a "system that
is not in direct interaction with the developing person but
has indirect effects on the person" [54, p. 26]. For instance,
parents in poor neighborhoods may face greater obstacles
in taking proper care of their children. If there is a lack of
resources in such neighborhoods, the relationship between
lack of parental support and lack of community resources
may not directly affect an adolescent's behavior, but indirectly
affect it. The last system is identified as the macrosystem,
which includes influences by one's culture, norms, and laws
of society [54], In sum, the theory of ecology of human
development has not produced one uniform set of explana-
tions for interaction between individuals and environment.
Rather, it provides many possible explanations, such as
various interactions between parent, peer, school, and/or
community factors from all of these ecological sources. It
does, however, provide the best theoretical framework for
studies on bullying victimization because it describes fluid
and reciprocal interactions between peers, some of which
negatively impact those in asymmetrical power relationships
on campus.
1.4. Research Questions and Hypotheses. In sum, we believe
that further research is necessary to better understand the
etiology of bullying victimization, especially focusing on
the effects of school prevention/intervention strategies and
school environments on victimization. We first examine
whether school safety equipment and strategies are signif-
icantly related to various types of bullying victimization.
Based on the extant literature, it is expected that security
guards and security equipment have significant effects on var-
ious types of bullying victimization. Second, we expect that
school environments (e.g., awareness/fairness of school rules
and punishment and presence of gangs and guns at school)
are significant predictors of each type of victimization. Third,
we examine whether individual demographic characteristics
and deviant behaviors are significantly related to bullying
victimization.
2. Method
2.1. Sample and Procedure. Self-reported data on bullying
victimization were collected from 22,686 adolescents in the
2005/2007 school crime supplement (SCS) as a part of the
National Crime Victimization Survey in the United States.
SCS uses a rotating panel design of randomly selected house-
holds and is a collaborative cross-national study examining
school-related victimization among school-aged adolescents
to provide specific information for policymakers and prac-
titioners. In particular, SCS is designed to examine several
direct and indirect characteristics of bullying victimization
and bullying victims. In addition, the SCS component asks
respondents about school life, participation in extracurric-
ular activities, access to drugs, weapon carrying, and other
school-related issues. To obtain a nationally representative
sample, data were collected from school-aged adolescents
(between 12 and 18 years old) who were in middle school
4 Journal of Criminology
and high school. Since the purpose of the current study is to
understand school safety measures related to victimization at
school, the analysis is restricted to those who were enrolled in
private or public education programs during the six months
prior to the interview. Therefore, a total of 12,987 students
were eligible for the current study (59.3% ( = 6833) in 2005
and 55.1% ( = 6154) in 2007, resp.).
2.2. Dependent Variable. Even though bullying is considered
an aggressive behavior [57], bullying includes more subtle
patterns of violence such as taunting, teasing, name calling,
and spreading rumors [13]. In line with this assumption
regarding more subtle forms of bullying, a review of prior
research suggested key differences between students whose
bullying victimization involved physical or emotional/verbal
abuse versus students who did not experience any victim-
ization. For the purpose of the present study, therefore,
bullying victimization was defined by the most widely used
criteria [13]: (0) no victimization; (1) physical victimiza-
tion; (2) emotional victimization; and (3) both types of
victimization. Physical victimization is defined by four items:
"During this school year, has any student bullied you, such as
threatened you; pushed/shoved/tripped; you done anything
to you against your will; and destroyed your property." The
definition of emotional victimization also comprises four
items: "During this school year, has any student bullied
you, such as made fun of you or called you names; spread
rumors; excluded you" and "has anyone called you an
insulting or bad name at school having to do with your race,
religion, ethnicity, disability, gender, and sexual orientation."
Responses for each victimization item were recorded into a
categorical variable which was coded 0 if the respondent had
not experienced any such victimization incidents at school,
coded 1 if the respondent had experienced at least one of
these physical victimization incidents at school, coded 2 if the
respondent had experienced at least one of the emotional vic-
timization incidents at school, and coded 3 if the respondent
had experienced both physical and emotional victimization
incidents at school. The dependent variable used in our
analysis differs from that in some prior studies in that it
adds both physical and emotional victimization as a separate
category along with traditional categories including physical
and emotional victimization. This particular process allows
both physical and emotional victimization category to be
compared to a reference category (i.e., none) simultaneously.
2.3. School Characteristics. The SCS records contained mea-
sures of several characteristics commonly expected to differ-
entiate types of victimizations (see Table 1). Two groups of
school security measures were supposedly related to school
bullying victimization. The measured variable school security
guards included whether a respondent's school had security
guards or staff/adults in the hallways. We also employed
the school safety equipment measure that asked whether a
respondent's school had a metal detector, locked doors, or
security cameras. Among these three items, locked doors
and security cameras were selected as proxy variables for
school safety equipment. The school safety measures had a
dichotomous (1 = yes/0 = no) response.
In addition to school safety measures, we employed
school climate measures including fairness of school rules,
awareness of school rules, and awareness of school punishment.
Three items were combined to measure fairness of school
rules: "School rules are fair"; "Same punishment for breaking
rules"; and "School rules strictly enforced" (see Table 1).
It is expected that students who believe that school rules
are fairly and strictly administrated will be less likely to
have bullying victimization than other students who distrust
school's discipline management [53]. For further analysis, the
average scores were calculated based on these three items
so that the higher scores indicate that students think school
rules/punishments are trustworthy and fair. The reliability
coefficient (Cronbach's ) for fairness of school rules was 0.67.
The variable awareness of school rules asked whether "every-
one knows school rules," and awareness of punishments asked
whether "students know the punishment." Each item had
a four-point Likert-scale response ranging from 1 (strongly
disagree) to 4 (strongly agree).
Previous research on bullying victimization found that
school-related variables, such as students misbehaving, gangs
at school, guns at school, types of school, and school location,
were associated with bullying victimization [17]. In particular,
it is hypothesized that such school environment including
students misbehaving, gangs or guns at school are positively
related to each type of victimization. To examine the effects
of school-related characteristics on victimization, we used
three variables: students misbehaving, gangs at school, and
guns at school. A single item is used to measure fellow stu-
dents' misbehavior at school: "How often are you distracted
from doing your schoolwork by students misbehaving." The
response options for the item ranged from 1 = never, 2 =
Almost never, 3 = sometimes, and 4 = most of the time. Gangs
at school ("Are there any gangs at your school?") and guns
at school ("Do you know any students who have brought a
gun to your school during this school year?") were coded
into a binary variable (1 = yes/0 = no). In addition, since
public schools and schools located in urban areas may have
a higher percentage of bullying victimization compared with
their counterparts (i.e., private schools and rural areas) [21],
types of school (1 = private and 0 = public) and school location
(1 = urban and 0 = rural) were also included in the model in
order to control the potential intervening effects of type of
school and school location on bullying victimization.
2.4. Individual Characteristics. Because prior research indi-
cates that some social-demographic individual characteristics
are significant predictors of bullying victimization, we exam-
ine whether age, gender, household income, race/ethnicity,
deviant behaviors, academic performance, and extracurricu-
lar activities are significantly related to bullying victimization.
Age is an interval level variable, ranging from 12 to 18
years old. Sex is a dichotomous variable, coding male as 1
and female as 0. Race is also a dichotomous variable with
nonwhite as 1 and white as 0. Ethnicity is a dummy variable,
coding Hispanic as 1 and non-Hispanic as 0.
Additional measures of individual characteristics were
skipping class and fighting in the last 6 months; all were

6 Journal of Criminology
dichotomous variables coded 1 for yes and 0 for no. A
single item, "During this school year, across all subjects have
you gotten mostly?," was used to measure students' school
performance, and the response options were 1 = F; 2 = D;
3 = C; 4 = B; and 5 = A. The SCS also measured students'
participation in extracurricular activities consisting of items
asking, "Have you participated in athletic teams, spirit groups
(e.g., cheerleading or pep club), performing arts, academic
clubs, or student government?," which we coded as Extra-
Curricular Activities (1 = yes/0 = no). (In order to check
for any possible multicollinearity (MC) problems among
independent and control variables, the variance inflation
factor (VIF) and tolerance statistics were calculated. Results
confirmed that there was no severe MC problem among those
variables (VIF < 1.46, tolerance > 0.69). Thus, the current
study simultaneously included all available school safety and
socioeconomic variables as well as control variables in the
regression models).
2.5. Analytic Strategy. Since the primary dependent variable
was a nominal variable with four discrete categories (i.e.,
consisting of unordered categories of no bullying, physical
bullying, verbal bullying, and both physical and verbal bul-
lying victimization), a multinomial logistic model (MNLM)
was used to estimate the effects of school safety variables on
school bullying victimizations. The MNLM is preferable to
binary logistic regression analysis because it takes account
of the unordered nature of the dependent variable and
provides more efficient estimations by producing multiple
logits simultaneously [58].
Missing values (data) are important because the improper
handling of missing values will produce biased coefficients
[59]. Thus, a missing data analysis was also conducted to
ensure the quality of the analysis. The preliminary results
confirmed that the missing observations of most of the
variables in this study's data occur completely at random.
However, some independent variables were found to be
significantly different between complete and incomplete data
(e.g., school guard). To correct this problem, we estimated the
multinomial logistic regressions using the sampling weight
option (pweights) in STATA [60]. In particular, we employed
an inverse probability weight (IPW) procedure so that all
observations from the complete data were given more weight
than others when computing estimates. An IPW procedure
consists of two practical steps. First, a logistic regression
analysis was conducted to estimate a subject's probability
of being fully observed (Prob [ = [1, 1, 1, . . . , 1] | 0
]).
Then, the inverse of these probabilities were calculated and
used to re-weight contributions to generalized estimating
equations in a completer-only analysis (i.e., MNLM with
pweights). Finally, STATA yields robust standard errors that
automatically adjust potential misspecifications bias since
probabilities are only estimated in the main model [61].
3. Findings
Table 2 illustrates the descriptive statistics for the dependent
and independent variables used in this analysis. Of 12,987
students, approximately 33 percent of students reported
experiencing some form of bullying in the previous school
year. Among those bullied students, slightly more than
half had been emotionally bullied (52 percent), and about
39 percent had experienced both physical and emotional
bullying, followed by physical bullying (nine percent). This
relatively low level of bullying victimization was found to be
in several large-scale studies [1]. One recent study found that
almost a third (29.9 percent) of their sample (15,000 US junior
high and high school students) reported moderate to frequent
involvement in bullying including the bully, the victim, or the
bully-victim [7].
In terms of school safety measures, most schools had
security guards (and/or assigned police officers), school staff
members, or other adults supervising the hallways and class-
rooms (70 percent). Most schools had security equipment,
such as locked entrance or exit doors (61 percent) or security
cameras (70 percent), to monitor and secure the school
during the day.
Most students also reported that school rules were fair
and that they were aware of school rules and punishments.
Some students reported gangs at school and that they knew
of students who had brought a gun to their school (27
percent and five percent, resp.). With regard to demographic
characteristics of students, few students had skipped a class
(seven percent) or gotten into a fight (six percent) in the
previous six months. Most of the students indicated that they
had been participating in extracurricular activities such as
athletics, spirit groups, and arts during the previous school
year (67 percent). Finally, the average age of the students was
about 15 years old, with a standard deviation of 1.90, and
about half of the students were male (51 percent). Roughly
20 percent identified themselves as nonwhite and Hispanic
or Latino.
Table 3 presents results from a multinomial logistic
regression with inverse probability weighted estimation. (We
also estimated multinomial logistic regressions without IPW
estimation. Although the magnitudes of coefficients were
slightly changed, the significant results were remaining con-
sistent throughout the models. Finally, it should be noted
that the number of observations after listwise deletion of
incomplete cases for both regression models are 6,988 and
6,891, resp.). The results indicated that the variables of
security guards, fairness and awareness of school rules, gangs
and guns at school, students misbehaving, and teachers'
punishment were found to be statistically significant pre-
dictors of overall bullying victimization. More specifically,
students attending schools where security guards (and/or
police officers) were present in the hallways were less likely to
report being victims of physical bullying, emotional bullying,
and both physical and emotional bullying (exp (b) = 0.68,
0.80, and 0.74, resp.). None of security equipment had a
significant effect on each type of bullying victimization
except one model. That is, students who attend schools with
locked doors were more likely to report physical bullying
victimization (exp (b) = 1.49). If the level of fairness of
school rules were to increase by one unit, the relative risk
of experiencing emotional or both physical and emotional
bullying (versus none) would be expected to decrease by

factors of 0.91 and 0.86, respectively, given the other variables
in the model are held constant. Similarly, students' perception
of their awareness of school rules and punishments were
also negatively related to physical bullying victimization
and emotional bullying victimization, respectively. That is,
students who reported a higher level of awareness of school
rules were less likely to report victimization for physical
bullying (exp (b) = 0.73). Similarly, students who knew
punishments also were less likely to be emotionally bullied
than their counterparts (exp (b) = 0.87).
In addition, the presence of gangs in respondents' schools
increased the relative risk of bullying victimization, par-
ticularly for emotional or both physical and emotional
forms. However, after controlling for students' individual
characteristics, the presence of gangs in the schools became
a nonsignificant predictor for physical bullying. The same
patterns were found with respect to the presence of guns
in the schools. In other words, students who knew of other
students who had brought a gun to the school or saw
another student with a gun at school were more likely to be
victimized by emotional and both physical and emotional
bullyings (exp (b) = 1.48 and 1.88, resp.). Students who
were frequently distracted from doing their school work
because other students were misbehaving (e.g., talking) were
more likely to report victimization for all forms of bullying.
Students who thought their teachers spent too much time
punishing students had a greater risk of being victims of
emotional and both physical and emotional bullyings (exp
(b) = 1.13 and 1.38). Finally, security equipment (i.e., security
cameras), type of school (public versus private), and school
location (urban versus rural) were not statistically significant
predictors of bullying victimization.
With regard to individual and demographic character-
istics, students who skipped classes were more likely to be

emotionally bullied, and students who were in one or more
physical fights at school in the previous six months were at
greater risk of being victims of all forms of bullying (e.g., exp
(b) for physical bullying = 7.06). Students who participated
in any type of extracurricular activities were more likely to
report being victims of emotional and both physical and
emotional bullyings. Students who maintained a higher GPA
were less likely to be victims of both physical and emotional
bullying (exp (b) = 0.86). Nonwhite and Hispanic students
were less likely than whites and non-Hispanics to report being
victims of both physical and emotional bullyings (exp (b) =

4. Discussion
Many researchers have examined the effects of individual-
level (or microlevel) characteristics on victimization of school
bullying. And, only a few researchers have examined the
effects of school safety equipment/strategies on victimiza-
tion. However, existing research has usually tested for vic-
timization based on non-nationally representative samples.
Furthermore, the majority of prior victimization studies paid
lesser attention to the etiology of different types of bullying
Journal of Criminology 9
victimization. The current study, using a national representa-
tive sample of youths in the United States, addresses several
limitations of prior research on school bullying victimization.
The study provides a test of variables that examine bullying
victimization, especially focusing on individual/demographic
and school environmental factors and school antibullying
measures. Next, we summarize the key findings of the current
study and implications for future research.
Overall, the current findings show that several individual
characteristics (i.e., school performance, race, ethnicity, and
gender) are significantly related to physical, emotional, or
general (i.e., both emotional and physical) bullying vic-
timization. Consistent with prior studies [62, 63], there is
a negative association between academic achievement and
victimization, in that academically competent respondents
are less likely to report being victims of general school
bullying. Also, the results show that boys are more likely to
be bullied physically, while girls are more likely to report
emotional bullying. These findings may suggest that boys are
particularly susceptible to intimidation if they appear out-
wardly weak, while girls are more likely than boys to engage
in relational bullying, to use rumors or misinformation, and
to deny (or shun) targets [64]. Interestingly, the findings
indicate that non-white adolescents are less likely than their
white peers to report general school bullying, consistent with
several prior findings that minority youth were less likely to
be victimized than white youth [7, 30]. However, there is
some disagreement in the literature about racial differences
in victimization. For example, Hanish and Guerra [65] found
that white adolescents were the highest ethnic group at risk
for victimization among different racial and ethnic groups.
Findings from Seals and Young [37], on the contrary, found
that there is no clear-cut evidence regarding the role of race
and ethnicity on peer victimization. That being said, the
relationship between race and ethnicity and vulnerability to
bullying is still unclear and seems to vary. Because of the
mixed findings regarding race and ethnicity, there is a need
for further research to better understand the crucial role of
race and ethnicity on peer victimization.
As expected, the findings indicate that students' delin-
quent behaviors are significantly related to school bullying
victimization. The results show that those respondents who
reported starting and/or being involved in physical fights
at school in the previous six months have a greater risk of
being a victim of physical and emotional bullying. Thus, it
is highly possible that adolescents who behave aggressively
toward others are indeed more likely to engage in interper-
sonal conflicts and then become a target of retaliation by
peers, as suggested by Perry et al. [66]. In addition, this is
consistent with previous findings that individuals engaged
in risky or deviant behaviors, or whose lifestyle has exposed
them to risky environments, are more likely to experience
victimization [67­69].Unexpectedly, the results indicate that
students who participate in various extracurricular activities
are more likely to be subjects of emotional and general
bullying. This finding contrasts with a prior study that found
that extracurricular activities had a preventive effect on
school violence [70]. Although further research is necessary
to better understand the relationship between extracurricular
activities and school bullying victimization, we can speculate
that students who engage in extracurricular activities may
have more opportunities to interact with bullies without staff
supervision, especially if these activities are after school.
Various school environmental factors have significant
effects on bullying victimization on school grounds. The
presence, in school, of gangs and guns and teachers' frequent
use of punishment have salient effects on both physical and
emotional school bullyings victimization in the expected
directions. We also found the prevalence of other students'
distracting behaviors to be important in predicting both
physical and emotional bullyings victimization. Conversely,
students' perceptions of the fairness of school rules is nega-
tively related to school bullying victimization, in that students
who perceive greater fairness in school rules are less likely
to be victimized physically and emotionally. These findings
clearly indicate the importance of reducing students' expo-
sure to adverse school environmental factors and improving
school fairness in discipline and rules in order to reduce
school bullying victimization.
Our analyses of school safety measures show that stu-
dents attending schools where security guards (and/or police
officers) are present in the hallways are less likely to be
bullied. Students may feel safe in their school, and bullies
may have limited opportunities to bully other students when
schools employ security personnel [71]. Interestingly, the
findings show that security equipment (i.e., locked doors) is
not significantly related to school bullying victimization, even
though the installation of security equipment in schools has
become a popular preventive/deterrent measure. This finding
is consistent with previous findings [72, 73] that school-
based security equipment measures do not fundamentally
address school bullying and victimization. It may be pos-
sible that locked doors create a heavily scrutinized, prison-
like feeling and that intrusive searches foster unwelcoming
school environments [74]. Consequently, students may feel
oppressed, which in turn may lead them to engage in school
violence and bullying [8, 72, 73, 75]. Regarding security
cameras, the results from multinomial logistic regression
analyses also yield unexpected results. Inconsistent with our
expectation, security cameras (a proxy measure for security
equipment) were found to be positively associated with
physical bullying. That is, students at schools with security
cameras tend to experience slightly more physical bullying
victimization. It seems impossible to argue that the security
cameras are a cause of physical bullying victimization. A
feasible explanation for this particular finding is that schools
installed security cameras because of increasing number of
physical bullying victimization among students.
Notably, it is concluded that other school-related charac-
teristics (i.e., gangs at school, guns at school, and teachers'
punishment) are not effective in reducing physical victimiza-
tion nor effective in reducing risk of emotional victimization.
This result is perhaps not surprising. Students may not be
involved in any type of inappropriate behaviors, if they are
aware of the likelihood of being caught because of high
security strategies and aware of the potential consequences
because of school rules. This is true despite enrollment in
schools characterized by poor security measures.
10 Journal of Criminology
Another explanation can be offered. According to Ma
[76], a school climate characterized by students' disruptive
behaviors may encourage bullies. Similarly, Nansel et al. [7]
found that bullies reported a significantly poor perception
of school climate. Bullies can incorporate and employ new
techniques to bully other students. For example, bullies avoid
physical interaction, which may result in physical signs (e.g.,
damaged property, physical signs or bruises, etc.), rather than
verbally abuse or ignore the other students completely to
avoid being caught by school officials (REVIEWER 1 ­ no. 2).
5. Future Directions and Implications
Given our findings, an interesting question remains to be
addressed: how can school safety strategies maximize effec-
tive outcomes that reduce the risk of being bullied? The
answer to this question undoubtedly involves future research
to test the efficacy of intervention strategies. First, research
should closely examine the specific characteristics of school
safety measures. As prior research has shown, perceptions
of school safety conditions, such as gated/locked school
entrances, visitor sign-in protocols, metal detectors, and
security cameras have direct and indirect relationships with
school violence [71]. By including these perceptions of the
quality of school safety conditions, we can gain a better sense
of the effect of safety strategies and their ability to prevent
bullying victimization.
Second, school bullying interventions should also focus
on the interplay between factors such as students' family,
school, and community characteristics and students' procliv-
ity to bully others at school. From the victim's perspective,
it is important to understand how these factors interact
with bullying and how these factors can be taken into
account in order to develop better intervention programs
that help to create safer school environments. Thus, it is
becoming increasingly clear that a more holistic approach
that moves beyond the geographical boundaries of a school
may be needed to prevent school bullying. In addition,
research should investigate the characteristics of bullying
and of victimized children that are associated with students'
experience of bullying victimization. Understanding these
factors will lead to a more thorough evaluation of school
violence and, subsequently, better prevention programs.
Overall, the results of the current study point to the
critical role that school security guards/resource officers and
the school climate/environment play in students' risk of
becoming victims of school bullying. The results also show
that individual background characteristics influence the risk
of victimization. However, the main goal of the current study,
namely, the effect of school security equipment on victimiza-
tion, has not been realized. Nonetheless, our findings have
obvious implications for preventing victimization in schools.
First, the findings of the current study imply that gender
is an important predictor of bullying victimization. Indeed,
female students may be more vulnerable to emotional/verbal
threats because of negative peer evaluation and loss of peer
relationships, while males are more likely to be hurtful
because of their attitude toward social dominance [77].
Therefore, interventions may work best when combined with
gender-specific programs. In particular, school prevention
strategies should focus on enhancing pleasant social experi-
ences within the school, encouraging relational ties among
female students. For male students, prevention efforts should
focus more on fostering adaptive cognitions for aggressive
and disruptive behavior.
As school bullying has received a significant amount of
attention, several models and approaches of bullying pre-
vention programs have emerged. According to Espelage and
Swearer [50], there are over 300 school-based antibullying
programs. Although all of the models vary by background,
procedures, type of curriculum, and participants, each model
shares common goals to achieve outcomes such as identifying
the bully and victim, helping to cope with negative conse-
quences of bullying, providing support and protection for
victims, and reducing school bullying [50, 78, 79]. However,
many evaluations studies have reported mixed and incon-
sistent results across samples and measures [80, 81]. The
mixed results suggest that there is no single best approach
to school bullying prevention. Based on our findings, many
school-related characteristics were associated with emotional
victimization across the United States. Although emotional
bullying has detrimental effects on victims, relatively little
attention has been given to this type of bullying [82]. In
enhancing existing school bullying prevention program, both
educators and stakeholders must be aware of less obvious acts
of bullying victimization, such as emotional bullying.
The findings of the current study also imply that an
unsupportive school climate clearly contributes to bullying
victimization. The school-wide physical and social environ-
ments can serve as protective factors that contribute to a
safe and healthy school. Thus, it is necessary to create a
school climate that it proactive in inhibiting bullying and
is transparent in its intolerance of bullying. In particular,
it is important for schools to address students' distracting
behaviors and the presence of gangs at school. According
to Fox and Burstein [83], gangs and gang activity on school
grounds increase violence because gangs are willing to terror-
ize an entire school, create fear among students, and disrupt
the school climate. Strategies should focus on generating
school resources that are likely to discourage students from
joining gangs and engaging in violence, in order to decrease
the level of violence in school. Overall, no matter how
diligent and responsible security strategies are in preventing
school bullying, there can be no absolute guarantees that
bullying will not occur. However, if school staff/officials,
parents, and the community seek interagency coordination
and collaboration to better facilitate informal social control,
these may prove to be decisive factors that can prevent school
bullying and successfully suppress gang activities.
