Relationship between hepatitis C and microalbuminuria: Re-
sults from the NHANES III.
Background. Hepatitis C infection is associated with diabetes
mellitus and insulin resistance and it is suggested that metabolic
syndrome is common in patients with hepatitis C. Microalbu-
minuria is common in patients with diabetes and metabolic
syndrome; however, no studies have examined the relationship
between microalbuminuria and hepatitis C infection.
Methods. We conducted a nested case-control study to ex-
amine the relationship between nondiabetic subjects with hep-
atitis C infection and microalbuminuria by using the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES
III) database. Study cohort consisted of 15,336 adults from the
United States who had hepatitis C antibody measured as part of
the NHANES III. The prevalence of microalbuminuria and the
metabolic syndrome were compared between individuals with
positive hepatitis C infection antibody (N = 362) and matched
controls (N = 995). Additional analyses were conducted to de-
fine the association between hepatitis C infection and microal-
buminuria.
Results. Prevalence of microalbuminuria in patients with hep-
atitis C infection was 12.4% and it was significantly higher than
in controls (7.5%) (P = 0.001). This difference persisted even af-
ter excluding diabetics from the analyses (11.4% vs. 6.7%) (P =
0.001). However, there was no difference in the prevalence of
the metabolic syndrome between two groups (19% vs. 19%)
(P = 0.9). After controlling for relevant covariates, hepatitis C
infection was independently associated with microalbuminuria
in subjects without diabetes (odds ratio 1.99, 95% CI 1.38­2.85)
(P = 0.008). Older age and African Americans were indepen-
dently associated with microalbuminuria in nondiabetic hepati-
tis C patients.
Conclusion. Hepatitis C infection is independently associ-
ated with microalbuminuria but not the metabolic syndrome.
Older age and African Americans are strongly associated
with microalbuminuria in nondiabetic hepatitis C subjects.
More research is needed to explore the implications of these
observations.
Key words: microalbuminuria, metabolic syndrome, hepatitis C.

Chronic hepatitis C infection is associated with higher
prevalence and incidence of diabetes mellitus [1­8]. Stud-
ieshavealsoshownthatnondiabeticpatientswithchronic
hepatitis C have higher prevalence of insulin resistance.
Because of the association between hepatitis C and di-
abetes and insulin resistance, it is of interest to explore
if individuals with hepatitis C have higher prevalence of
the metabolic syndrome. In one uncontrolled study, the
prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in patients with
hepatitis C was nearly 63% [9]. However, there are no
controlled studies that systematically evaluated the asso-
ciation between hepatitis C and the metabolic syndrome.
Microalbuminuria is defined as subclinical urinary ex-
cretion of albumin and it has been shown to predict the
progression of renal disease in patients with diabetes as
well as cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the
diabetic and the general population [10­12]. It clusters
with the metabolic syndrome and studies have shown
a relationship between microalbuminuria and individual
components of the metabolic syndrome (hyperglycemia,
insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, and
hypertension) [10­15]. As patients with hepatitis C are
known to have higher prevalence of some components of
the metabolic syndrome, one could hypothesize that in-
dividuals with hepatitis C may have higher prevalence of
microalbuminuria.However,thishypothesishasnotbeen
formally tested. Additionally, hepatitis C infection is also
commonly associated with chronic renal disease. This ex-
trahepatic manifestation is either related to intrinsic renal
disease or cryoglobulinemia. Because of the strong asso-
ciation between hepatitis C infection and chronic renal
disease, it would be of importance to explore if unselected
patients with hepatitis C infection have higher prevalence
of microalbuminuria.
We have conducted a nested case-control study by
using NHANES III (the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey) database to examine if
(1) individuals with hepatitis C had higher prevalence
of metabolic syndrome and microalbuminuria than the
matched controls, (2) hepatitis C was independently asso-
ciated with microalbuminuria in nondiabetic individuals,

METHODS
The NHANES III was conducted in the United States
from 1988 through 1994 by the National Center for
Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. The NHANES III used complex, multistage,
stratified, clustered samples of civilian, noninstitutional-
ized populations with age 2 months and older to collect
information about the health and diet of people resid-
ing in the United States. A detailed description of the
survey and its sampling procedures are available on its
Web site (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/
NHANESIII Reference Manuals.htm). This study was
approved by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) In-
stitutional Review Board and all participants provided
written informed consent.
Study cohort and definitions
During the survey period, 18,162 subjects underwent
physical examination and laboratory assessment at a
mobile examination center. After excluding subjects
<20 years old who lacked plasma glucose values (N =
1132) and those with missing hepatitis C (N = 479) or
plasma glucose (N = 674) or urine albumin data (N =
541), the remaining 15,336 participants constituted our
study cohort (Fig. 1).
Individuals with detectable antihepatitis C infec-
tion antibody [by second generation enzyme-linked im-
munosorbent assay (ELISA)] in the absence of a positive
hepatitis B surface antigen and serum transferrin satura-
tion >50% were considered to have hepatitis C. Age,
gender, ethnicity and body mass index (BMI)-matched
individuals with normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
(40 U/L in men and 31 U/L in women), undetectable
hepatitis C antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen, no sig-
nificant alcohol consumption or serum transferrin satura-
tion 50% constituted the "control group." Depending
upon the availability, one to threee controls were ran-
domly selected for each participant with hepatitis C. The
average alcohol consumption was calculated based on
theresponsestotwosurveyqueriesthatquestionedabout
the number of days of drinking over the past 12 months
and the number of drinks per day on a given drinking
day. The average alcohol consumption >one drink/day
in women and >two drinks/day in men was considered as
significant alcohol consumption [16].
Subjects were considered to have diabetes mellitus if
their fasting plasma glucose 126 mg/dL or if they re-
ported ongoing usage of antidiabetic medications, either
oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin injection [17]. Sub-
jects were considered to have hypertension if their sys-
tolic pressure 140 mm Hg or diastolic pressure 90 mm
Hg, as defined by the recent Joint National Committee
on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of
High Blood Pressure (JNC VII) guidelines, or if they re-
portedcurrentusageofantihypertensivemedication,orif
Liangpunsakul and Chalasani: Relationship between hepatitis C and microalbuminuria 287
they were told by their physicians of having hypertension
[18].
The presence of the metabolic syndrome was deter-
mined based on the guidelines proposed by Third Report
of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult
Treatment Panel (ATP III) [19]. The ATP III clinical def-
inition of the metabolic syndrome requires the presence
of three or more of the following: (1) waist circumference
>102 cm in men and >88 cm in women; (2) triglyceride
level 150 mg/dL; (3) high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
cholesterol level <40 mg/dL in men and <50 mg/dL in
women, (4) systolic blood pressure 130 mm Hg or dias-
tolic pressure 85 mm Hg; and (5) fasting plasma glucose
110 mg/dL [19].
The presence of insulin resistance was estimated by
the Homeostasis Model Assessment Method (HOMA),
a measure of insulin resistance which is calculated using
the equation [fasting insulin (lU/mL) × fasting glucose
(mmol/L)]/22.5 [20].
The urinary excretion of albumin was expressed as
amount excreted per milligram of urinary creatinine. In-
dividuals with urine albumin levels between 30 to 300 lg
per mg creatinine were considered to have "microalbu-
minuria." Individuals with urine albumin levels greater
than 300 lg per mg creatinine were considered to have
"significant proteinuria" [21].
Laboratory measurements
The laboratory procedures followed in the NHANES
III are described in detail elsewhere. All venous blood
samples were immediately centrifuged and shipped
weekly at -20C to a central laboratory. Antibodies
to hepatitis C infection were measured by a second-
generation enzyme immunoassay (Abbott Laborato-
ries, Chicago, IL, USA). Serum transaminases were
determined using the alpha-ketoglutarate reactions.
Blood glucose was measured by modified hexokinase
method. Cholesterol and triglycerides were measured
quantitatively by a peroxidase-catalyzed reaction and
HDL cholesterol was measured following the precipita-
tion of the other lipoproteins (Boehringer Mannheim,
Indianapolis, IN, USA). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol was calculated by using the formula: LDL =
total cholesterol - (triglyercide/5) - HDL. Serum crea-
tinine level was measured by the modified Jaff´
e reaction
(Hitachi 737 analyzer; Boehringer Mannheim). Urinary
albumin was measured by a solid-phase fluorescent im-
munoassay.
Statistical analysis
Quality control procedures, database management,
and statistical analyses were performed using SAS soft-
ware for Windows, version 8 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
USA). Descriptive statistics such as mean, standard de-

viations (SD), ranges, and percentages, were used to char-
acterize the study patients. Comparisons between groups
were made using Student t test for the continuous and
chi-square (v2) test for the categorical variables. Uni-
variate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were
conducted to explore (1) the relationship between hep-
atitis C and microalbuminuria and (2) the variables that
are independently associated with microalbuminuria in
nondiabetic individuals with hepatitis C. Variables with
univariate P values < 0.05 were entered into the multi-
variate analyses. The strength of association was reported
as odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI and P values. A P value
of < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

no difference in the waist circumference, subjects with
hepatitis C had significantly higher prevalence of dia-

23]. The prevalence of hepatitis C in patients with the
metabolic syndrome was 1.8% and it was significantly
lower than the participants without the metabolic syn-
drome (2.6%, OR 0.67, and 95% CI 0.52­0.88).
Microalbuminuria in hepatitis C
The prevalence of microalbuminuria in the entire co-
hortwas9.8%,andafterexcludingthediabetics,itspreva-
lence was 7.9%. The prevalence of microalbuminuria in
individuals with hepatitis C was significantly higher than
the controls (12.4% vs. 7.5%, respectively) (P = 0.001)
(Table 2). This difference in the prevalence of microal-
buminuria persisted even after excluding subjects with
diabetes from the analyses (11.4% vs. 6.7%) (P = 0.001).
Similarly, the prevalence of significant proteinuria was
significantly higher in patients with hepatitis C than the
controls (1.9% vs. 0.2%) (P = 0.001) (Table 2).
In order to establish the independent association be-
tween microalbuminuria and hepatitis C, univariate and
multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted
on subjects without diabetes in our cohort after control-
ling for the relevant covariates (N = 13,990) (Table 3).
These analyses showed that hepatitis C was indepen-
dently associated with microalbuminuria (OR 1.99 and
95% CI 1.38­2.85) (P = 0.008).
In order to examine why some patients with hepatitis
C have microalbuminuria, we performed the univariate
and multivariate logistic analyses on hepatitis C patients
without diabetes (N = 325) (Table 4). Older age (OR 1.05
and 95% CI 1.03­1.08) (P = 0.01) and African Americans
(OR 3.97 and 95% CI 1.70­9.29) (P = 0.002) were inde-
pendently associated with microalbuminuria in patients
with hepatitis C. The prevalence of microalbuminuria in
older African American subjects (age 50 years) with
hepatitis C was 33.3% and it was significantly higher than
in African Americans <50 years of age (11.3%) or Cau-
casians 50 years of age (18.3%) or Caucasians <50 years
of age (5.9%). The statistically significant relationship be-
tween microalbuminuria and age and race was indepen-
dent of hypertension.

Analyses of hepatitis C patients who are hepatitis C
infection RNA positive
The NHANES III subsequently released the hepatitis
C infection RNA data on the stored serum samples and
we have conducted a separate analysis to examine the
prevalence of microalbuminuria in subjects who are hep-
atitis C infection RNA positive and the controls matched
according to the criteria listed above. Of the 363 patients
who had detectable hepatitis C antibody, 263 (72.5%)
were hepatitis C infection RNA positive. This subanal-
ysis consisted of 261 hepatitis C infection RNA-positive
subjects (two patients had no matched controls) and 727
matched controls. The prevalence of microalbuminuria in
individuals with positive hepatitis C infection RNA was
significantly higher than the controls (12.6% vs. 7.3%, re-
spectively) (P = 0.03). This difference in the prevalence
of microalbuminuria persisted even after excluding sub-
jects with diabetes from the analyses (11.8% vs. 6.0%)
(P = 0.01).
DISCUSSION
Several important findings have emerged from this
case-control study. First, we found that individuals with
hepatitis C have significantly higher prevalence of mi-
croalbuminuriathanthematchedcontrolsafterexcluding
subjects with diabetes. Second, we found that hepati-
tis C was independently associated with microalbumin-
uria. Third, the association between hepatitis C and
microalbuminuria was independent of diabetes, insulin
resistance, or the metabolic syndrome. Finally, we failed
to find an association between hepatitis C and the
metabolic syndrome.
OurfindingthathepatitisCisindependentlyassociated
with microalbuminuria is novel and may have important
clinical implications. In general, microalbuminuria is con-
sidered to be a predictor of progressive renal disease and
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetics and
general population. It is clearly established that hepatitis
C infection is associated with renal disease [24]. Hepati-
tis C is not only associated with membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis (related or unrelated to cryoglobu-
linemia) [24­27], but studies have also demonstrated that
subjects with hepatitis C increase the risk of protein-
uria following liver or kidney transplantation [28­30].
Recently, Ishizaka et al [31] suggested that hepatitis C
infection is associated with atherosclerosis. In this study
consisting of 4784 individuals from Japan, authors have
shown an association between hepatitis C seropositivity
and carotid atherosclerosis that was independent of tradi-
tional risk factors for atherosclerosis. However, we would
like to point out that our patients with hepatitis C had sig-
nificantly more favorable lipid profile (lower LDL and
higher HDL) than the controls. More research is needed
to confirm if individuals with hepatitis C have increased
atherosclerosis and if microalbuminuria can predict renal
disease and/or atherosclerosis in individuals with chronic
hepatitis C.
Our study has several limitations that deserve further
discussion. First, we defined the presence of microal-
buminuria based on a single measurement of urinary
albumin, rather than multiple measurements as recom-
mended by the American Diabetes Association. Al-
though it would be ideal to define microalbuminuria
based on multiple urine collections, unfortunately the
NHANES III was a cross-sectional study, and as such
it lacked sequentially collected urine samples. There is
precedent in the literature that examined the associa-
tion between metabolic syndrome and microalbumin-
uria using the NHANES III database [32]. Second, as
liver histology data were not available, we could not as-
sess the relationship between the severity of liver dam-
age and the prevalence of microalbuminuria. Third, our
observations are descriptive in nature and do not offer
mechanistic clues to why patients with hepatitis C infec-
tion have higher prevalence of microalbuminuria. The
NHANES III did not measure cryoglobulin levels and it
also lacked adequate data on the rheumatoid factor mea-
surements. Finally, because of the cross-sectional nature
of the survey, temporal relationships between hepatitis C
and microalbuminuria could not be established. Despite
all these limitations, we believe that our study makes sev-
eral important and hypotheses-generating observations.
CONCLUSION
Hepatitis C is an independent predictor of microal-
buminuria in subjects without diabetes. The prevalence
of the metabolic syndrome in patients with hepatitis C
is not significantly different than the matched controls.
Older age and African Americans are strongly associ-
ated with microalbuminuria in nondiabetic hepatitis C
subjects. More research is needed to confirm these find-
ings and to examine their implications.
