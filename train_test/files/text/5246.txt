Introduction
Maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) has received
substantial international attention and is high on global
health and development agendas. Investing in MNCH is rec-
ognised as contributing to poverty reduction, economic
growth and productivity, and more stable societies (Singh,
Darroch, Ashford, & Vlassof, 2009). Poor MNCH remains a
significant problem in many low- and middle-income coun-
tries (LMICs) and poses a significant gap to achieving the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This review and
commentary on the literature focuses on South Sudan, a
country that continues to face considerable challenges in
meeting MNCH care needs and improving health outcomes.
Drawing on both gray and published literature, it provides an
overview of the MNCH situation in late-2014, and seeks to
bring together available information on the MNCH-related
challenges facing South Sudan's people and systems.
Framing Maternal and Child Health Within the
Millennium Development Goals
Of the eight MDGs, set in 2000 with a 2015 end-point, three
are specifically focused on health: MDG 4--Reduce Child
Mortality, MDG 5--Improve Maternal Health, and MDG
6--Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and other Diseases. Explicit
attention to MNCH prompted many global initiatives, includ-
ing the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health
(PMNCH) hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO)
and UNICEF and established in 2005 (PMNCH, 2013), and
the Countdown to 2015 for Maternal, Newborn, Child
Survival. Recognizing the need for a global strategy, United
Nations (UN) Secretary General Ban Ki-moon launched
"Every Woman, Every Child" in 2010, which set out the key
areas requiring action to mobilise financing, strengthen pol-
icy, and improve service delivery (PMNCH, 2010).
The MDG 2015 target date has sparked global debate sur-
rounding what should follow. The UN-led global consulta-
tion on health from October 2012 to February 2013 led to a
report on Health in the post-2015 period. Among a range of
proposals that included a focus on universal health coverage,

Maternal and Child Health in South
Sudan: Priorities for the Post-2015
Agenda
Ngatho Mugo1,2, Anthony B. Zwi1, Jessica R. Botfield1,
and Caitlyn Steiner1
Abstract
The Republic of South Sudan continues to face considerable challenges in meeting maternal, newborn and child health
(MNCH) care needs and improving health outcomes. Ongoing instability and population displacement undermine scope for
development, and damaged infrastructure, low coverage of health services, and limited government capacity and a human
resource base have resulted in a fragmented health system. Despite considerable attention, effort and support, the issues
and challenges facing South Sudan remain deep and sustained, and urban­rural disparities are considerable. There is a need
to maintain investments in MNCH care and to support developing systems, institutions, and programs. This review of the
literature offers a commentary and appraisal of the current MNCH situation in South Sudan. It explores the barriers and
challenges of promoting MNCH gains, and identifies priorities that will contribute to addressing the Millennium Development
Goals and the emerging health priorities for the post-2015 development agenda.

the determinants of health and the unfinished MDG agenda,
was also recognition of the significant challenges posed by
conflict to improving health in many countries (The World
We Want, 2013).
Discussions around health on the post-2015 agenda iden-
tified "the unfinished MDG health agenda; a changing
agenda for global health; and health in the context of sustain-
able development" (UNAIDS, UNICEF, United Nations
Population Fund [UNFPA], & WHO, 2012). Schweitzer,
Makinen, Wilson, and Heymann (2012) recommend "the
current MDGs are likely to have to be included in some form
in the post-2015 goals" (p. 9). Critique surrounding the glob-
ally set quantifiable metrics and targets associated with the
MDGs are balanced with recognition that the ability to have
some form of targeting and universally agreed goals is of
value.
MDGs 4 and 5 are closely related, and have seen consid-
erable gains in the health status of women and children, with
under-five and maternal mortality rates falling by nearly
50% in recent years (Horton, 2012; UN, 2012). Despite this,
neither goal will be met for most countries, and where prog-
ress has been made, this is often unequally distributed (UN,
2012), with disparities evident in health status and the cover-
age of health interventions between and within countries
(Bhutta et al., 2010).
Accelerating progress requires adopting an integrated
package of essential interventions, structured around a
continuum of care approach, with services delivered by
functioning health systems (PMNCH, 2011). Evidence-
based interventions are well-known (PMNCH, 2011) and
feasible in resource-poor settings (Lule et al., 2005; You,
New, & Wardlaw, 2012). Despite knowledge of effective
and appropriate interventions, ensuring universal access
to essential health services remains challenging in
LMICs.
Maternal and Child Health Millennium
Development Goals in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
The SSA region has the highest rates of neonatal, under-five,
and maternal mortality. Neonatal mortality sits at 35 deaths
per 1,000 live births and has seen the least improvement over
the last 20 years. Although the average rate of reduction of
under-five deaths doubled from 1.2% per year (1990-2000)
to 2.4% per year (2000-2010), the overall mortality rate is
still high at 121 deaths per 1,000 live births. The rate of
decline is insufficient to meet the target of a two-thirds
reduction set through the MDGs. Similarly, although mater-
nal mortality has nearly halved globally since 1990, the
global target of reducing the maternal mortality ratio (MMR)
by three quarters is unlikely to be achieved by 2015, particu-
larly in SSA, the region with the highest MMR (500 deaths
per 100,000 live births) and where 56% of all maternal deaths
occur (UN, 2012).
"Post"-Conflict Maternal and Child Health
Challenges
Health in fragile and conflict-affected states is handicapped
by the legacy of violence on society, systems, and economic
development. Such states are often characterised by "eco-
nomic volatility, political instability, infrastructural collapse
and human resource scarcity," all of which contribute to the
deterioration of population health and challenges in stabilis-
ing systems (Haar & Rubenstein, 2012, p. 289). Haar and
Rubenstein (2012) cite evidence of worsened health status
and challenges in establishing stable health systems in frag-
ile and conflict-affected states as compared with their geo-
graphic neighbors and economic equivalents. Bornemisza
and Zwi (2008) highlight the dearth of health systems
research in fragile and conflict-affected states, despite the
longstanding recognition of the impact of conflict on health
systems (Zwi & Ugalde, 1989a, 1989b). By 2012, no fragile
or conflict-affected state had achieved a single MDG (Wyeth,
2012).
MNCH often deteriorates during a period of conflict. In
addition to poor health outcomes resulting from violent con-
flict and its effects on the health system, "girls and women
are particularly at risk as they are less likely to be able to
protect themselves from violence" (Southall, 2011). Infants
and children experience heightened risk of communicable
diseases, physical and mental trauma, and developmental
disorders as compared with their non-conflict-affected coun-
terparts (Bustreo, Genovese, Omobono, Axelsson, &
Bannon, 2005). Women and girls are at a greatly increased
risk of sexual and other forms of gender-based violence and
the associated risks to physical and psychosocial health and
well-being (Southall, 2011).
Objectives of the Article
This article focuses on South Sudan and brings together
available information on MNCH in late 2014, highlighting
the ongoing challenges facing its systems and people. We
undertook a narrative review, drawing on a range of data-
bases such as Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar, to iden-
tify relevant peer-reviewed and gray literature. We drew on
these data and insights to reflect on what is known about the
MNCH situation in South Sudan, and its relationship to con-
flict and health system development. Although admittedly
not fully comprehensive, we draw on available evidence to
synthesise the issues being faced and contribute to debates
around South Sudan development prospects, including the
2015 MDG deadline.
South Sudan Background and Health System
South Sudan general background.The Republic of South
Sudan is the world's newest nation, gaining independence in
Mugo et al. 3
2011 (Karimi, 2011). Its capital and largest city is Juba,
located in the southern state of Central Equatoria (Wakabi,
2006). The population of South Sudan in 2008 was 8.26 mil-
lion (South Sudan National Bureau of Statistics, 2012). It is
a land-locked country, bordered by Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African
Republic, and Sudan (South Sudan National Bureau of Sta-
tistics, 2012).
Although both Sudan and South Sudan are rich in natural
resources, South Sudan in particular has an abundance of
natural resources and contains the majority of oil reserves.
Although this has the potential to contribute to economic
growth and poverty reduction, giving South Sudan a major
advantage over many "post"-conflict1 governments (National
Population Council, 2010), it is also a source of ongoing con-
flict and instability--the so-called "resource curse" (Mbaku
& Smith, 2012), as witnessed again in 2013 and 2014.
After 21 years of civil war in Sudan, the signing of a
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between the
Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation
Movement/Army (SPLM/SPLA) in January 2005 brought an
end to Africa's longest running conflict between the North
and South (UNFPA, 2006). Six years later, the Republic of
South Sudan declared independence on 9 July 2011 (Embassy
of the Republic of South Sudan in Washington, 2011; Karimi,
2011). A timeline of major political developments in South
Sudan from 1956 to date highlights ongoing instability
(Table 1).
Background to South Sudan health system.Damaged infra-
structure, limited human resources, weak stewardship, and a
proliferation of non-government organisations (NGOs) char-
acterise health systems in many countries emerging from
conflict, and lead to disrupted and fragmented delivery of
health services (Roberts, Guy, Sondorp, & Lee-Jones, 2008).
In South Sudan, two decades of civil war resulted in a largely
dysfunctional health system and contributed to the deterio-
rating health status of the population during and after the
conflict (Neuse, Davis, Masbayi, Harvey, & Rajkotia, 2008),
leaving a third of the population without access to adequate
health services (Rajkotia, Boulenger, & Pressman, 2007).
The health status of the population is marked by high health
needs, limited health service provision, and significant
urban­rural and regional disparities (Roberts, Damundu,
Lomoro, & Sondorp, 2010).
The Ministry of Health (MoH) operates in line with the
decentralisation policy of the interim constitution of South
Sudan (2005) and the Local Government Act (2009).
According to the "Health Sector Development Plan 2011-
2015," the decentralised organisational structure should be
based on four levels of administrative structure: central,
state, county, and community (MoH & Government of South
Sudan [GoSS], 2011), as shown in Figure 1 and outlined

below. However, the reality on the ground shows many func-
tions underdeveloped, particularly at the lower levels.
It is envisaged that the Central MoH will provide policy
guidance, leadership, and funds for services, and is respon-
sible for monitoring and evaluation. The State MoH, located
in each state capital, is responsible for annual management
work plans, joint assessments, planning, monitoring and
evaluation, the referral system, and implementation of gov-
ernment health care and services. The County MoH should
oversee monthly management work plans, joint strategic
planning based on local needs, assessment and analysis of
local health and managerial needs, supervision, guidance and
monitoring, the referral system, and implementation of
health care and services. The Community MoH (Primary
Health Care Units and Centers) should ensure implementa-
tion of the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS), weekly
work plans, outreach activities, the referral system, and com-
munity participation (Rajkotia et al., 2007).
The BPHS outlines a package of health care services that
should be affordable and accessible to the majority of the
population, at the primary and secondary health care levels.
It covers curative, promotive, preventive, and managerial
activities (MoH & GoSS, 2011). Combined contributions
from the GoSS and the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) ini-
tially allowed for the provision of the BPHS (Health Systems
for Outcomes, 2009); however, according to the Health
Sector Development Plan 2011-2015, NGOs are often the
primary providers (MoH & GoSS, 2011).
The functioning of health care services within South
Sudan is described by the MoH (MoH & GoSS, 2011) as
structured around four key levels: community, primary, sec-
ondary, and specialised care, linked by a referral system.
Community health care should be provided by community
health workers, maternal and child health workers, and home
health promoters. Primary health care units are meant to be
the first point of contact between communities and the health
system and should provide basic preventive, promotive, and
curative care for around 15,000 people. These units aim to
provide higher-level services for around 50,000 people and,
in addition to services offered by primary health care units,
provide basic diagnostic laboratory services and maternity
care. County hospitals and state hospitals should provide
secondary-level care, including comprehensive obstetric
care, in-patient care, and surgery, for around 300,000 and
500,000 people, respectively. Numerous gaps and challenges
are encountered at each of these levels, however, particularly
in equipping and strengthening them to reach even minimum
standards (MoH & GoSS, 2011).
Health indicators.More than 50% of the South Sudanese
population lives below the poverty line, with particularly
high levels of poverty in rural areas (South Sudan National
Bureau of Statistics, 2012). This is comparable with the SSA
average of 47% of people living on less than $1.25 a day
(UN, 2012). The adult literacy rate in South Sudan is also
low at just 27% (53% urban areas and 22% rural areas) with
the rate among females half that of males (South Sudan
National Bureau of Statistics, 2012). Minimal progress has
been made toward meeting the MDG targets (Mustafa &
Alsiddiq, 2007; WHO, 2009). The GoSS is working toward
achieving these goals, but has argued it will require time
beyond 2015 (GoSS, 2011). Maternal, newborn, and child
mortality indicators used for monitoring progress toward the
achievement of MDGs 4 and 5 remain high (Table 2).

Mugo et al. 5
Mortality rates and other indicators are also presented below.
Data vary considerably by place of residence, mother's edu-
cation, gender, and wealth index, although data classified
according to these determinants are not always available.
In South Sudan, nearly 7% of women aged 15 to 49 marry
before their 15th birthday, a substantial reduction from
16.7% in 2006. However, 45% still married before the age of
18 in 2010, which is an increase from the 2006 average of
41% (MoH & National Bureau of Statistics, 2013). Young
women experience exacerbated problems during pregnancy
and delivery due to incomplete body growth (Bearinger,
Sieving, Ferguson, & Sharma, 2007), and are particularly at
risk of obstetric fistulae and obstructed labor.
In 2010, the average rate of contraception use for women
married or in union in South Sudan was 4%, only 0.5%
higher than in 2006 (MoH & National Bureau of Statistics,
2013). This can be compared with 8% in Sudan as a whole
(including Southern Sudan at that time; GoSS MoH &
Southern Sudan Commission for Census, 2007) and 25% in
SSA (UN, 2012). Access to family planning is strongly
linked to gender equity, empowerment of women, education,
and employment, and is a vital component to saving lives
and preserving health through preventing untimely and
unwanted pregnancies (Cleland et al., 2006; Grown, Gupta,
& Pande, 2005; Prata, Sreenivas, Greig, Walsh, & Potts,
2010; United Nations Children's Fund, 2012). Polygamy and
polygyny are common in South Sudan, with 41% of all
unions in 2010 being polygynous. Fewer than 10% of those
in polygamous unions use safe sex practices (MoH &
National Bureau of Statistics, 2013).
In Sudan (including Southern Sudan) in 2006, 36.4% of
women received antenatal care (ANC) from a medical doc-
tor, 12.7% from a nurse or midwife, and 14.5% from a tradi-
tional birth attendant. This contrasted with Southern Sudan
at the same time, where only 9.8% of women received ANC
from a medical doctor, 16.4% from a nurse or midwife, and
28.6% from a traditional birth attendant (GoSS MoH &
Southern Sudan Commission for Census, 2007). Thus, only
26.2% of women in Southern Sudan receivedANC by skilled
health personnel in 2006; this increased to 40.3% in 2010;
however, only 17% of women had the recommended 4 or
more ANC visits (MoH & National Bureau of Statistics,
2013). Pregnancy outcomes in LMICs can be greatly
improved through ANC (WHO, 2005).
The majority of maternal deaths occur during labor, deliv-
ery, and the immediate post-partum period, and as most are
preventable, it is essential that a skilled health professional
be available during childbirth. In Sudan as a whole, 49% of
births were delivered by skilled personnel in 2006: doctors
(6%), nurses or midwives (17%), and auxiliary midwives
(26%). These figures are substantially lower in the states of
Southern Sudan, with only 4% of deliveries being delivered
by a doctor and 7% by nurses and midwives. In both Northern
and Southern states, in 2006, traditional birth attendants
assisted with 20% of births (GoSS MoH & Southern Sudan
Commission for Census, 2007), which increased to 34% in
South Sudan in 2010 (MoH & National Bureau of Statistics,
2013). In 2006, friends and family assisted in 16% of births
in the North and 36% in the South (GoSS MoH & Southern
Sudan Commission for Census, 2007).

The postnatal period is critical for mothers and newborns
as they are at the highest risk of death during delivery and in
the first hours and days following childbirth. Newborn sur-
vival is inextricably linked to the health and survival of the
mother; thus, the early postnatal period is an important
period for delivering integrated interventions to both.
Postnatal care services from a skilled health care provider
following delivery optimise mother and newborn health, pro-
mote healthy behaviors and healthy household practices, and
strengthen linkages between maternal health and child health
programs (Sines, Syed, Wall, & Worley, 2007). Data on the
postnatal period in South Sudan appear to be scarce.
A child born in South Sudan has a 25% chance of dying
before age five(WHO, 2009); high mortality in under-fives is
associated with pneumonia, malaria, and diarrheal diseases.
Malnutrition is common: 27.6% of children below five are
moderately or severely underweight and 12.2% severely
underweight (MoH & National Bureau of Statistics, 2013).
South Sudan has one of the lowest levels of immunisation in
the world (UNICEF, 2011), with some sources suggesting
this has deteriorated over the past five years, whereas others
suggest this results from variations in data collection and
sampling. In 2010, only 4.3% of children aged 12 to 23
months had vaccination cards available, compared with
around 13% in Southern Sudan in 2006. Measles vaccination
coverage differed little between 2006 and 2010 (27.7% vs.
26.3%, respectively), as did the proportion of children who
received all recommended vaccinations (2.7% in 2006 vs.
2.6% in 2010; MoH & National Bureau of Statistics, 2013).
Health System Influences and Challenges in
South Sudan
The line between acute humanitarian intervention and lon-
ger-term health development in South Sudan is blurred
(Cometto, Fritsche, & Sondorp, 2010; Downie, 2012), as in
many "post"-conflict and fragile states (see, for example,
Macrae, Zwi, & Gilson, 1996). Recurring bouts of violence
and political instability make transitioning from humanitar-
ian service provision into national development challenging
for government officials, development partners, and citizens.
Decades of humanitarian assistance "fragmented horizon-
tally a variety of actors (at least 76 NGOs and six UN agen-
cies) and vertically across multiple disease-specific control
programmes" coupled with costly, short-term and inefficient
operations, severely impeded the development of institu-
tions, systems, policies, and personnel to contribute to lon-
ger-term development in Southern Sudan (Cometto et al.,
2010). Post-independence optimism was shattered by the
government's decision to halt oil production in January 2012,
hindering both planned health system development and dam-
aging relationships with external donors (Green, 2012).
A broad set of issues have an impact on effective develop-
ment and are briefly described below.
Governance. Throughout the period of conflict and immedi-
ately following the referendum, governance in Southern
Sudan was absent or constrained by the low capacity of gov-
ernment and lack of personnel. Initiatives aimed at improv-
ing governance following the referendum had mixed results
(Bennett et al., 2010), although the launch of the Health Sec-
tor Development Plan in early 2012 provided an opportunity
to facilitate improvement. Governance and implementation
arrangements are coordinated by development partners, usu-
ally in collaboration with South Sudan's MoH. Despite the
MoH demanding greater ownership, some concern around
the level of "fiduciary and governance risks" remains (Aus-
tralian Agency for International Development [AusAID],
2012). The lack of personnel skilled in policy, planning, and
oversight presents a serious challenge for governance
(Downie, 2012).
Security. Localised conflicts remain in South Sudan, due in
part to disputes over border areas and oil-revenue sharing
(the British Broadcasting Corporation [BBC] News, 2014;
GoSS, 2011; Maxwell, Gelsdorf, & Santschi, 2012; United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], 2013;
UNICEF, 2011). Widespread conflict broke out in South
Sudan in December 2013, leading to thousands of deaths and
the displacement of more than half a million people before a
ceasefire was signed between the government and rebels on
January 23, 2014 (Whiting & Migiro, 2014). By late 2014,
tensions remained high, and over 1.9 million people were
reported to be displaced since December 2013, of whom 1.4
million were displaced internally (Office for the Coordina-
tion of Humanitarian Affairs, 2014).
South Sudan also continues to experience other ongoing
conflicts and security challenges, including intertribal con-
flicts, widespread landmines and unexploded ordnance,
influx of returnees, and natural disasters. Years of conflict
contributed to the disintegration of social fabric, leading to
decreased protection and conditions exposing people to high
levels of violence and exploitation (UNICEF, 2011).
Landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) pose a con-
tinued threat to communities in South Sudan, despite grow-
ing awareness and control efforts (GoSS, 2011). The National
Mine Action Authority, which oversees relevant activities in
South Sudan, and other associated organizations have
increased the awareness of nearly two million people con-
cerning mine risks and have removed more than 50,000 land-
mines and UXOs (UN Mission in South Sudan, 2013).
South Sudan also faces a degree of internal insecurity
resulting from the return of refugees from camps in other
countries of Africa, refugees fleeing to South Sudan from
conflicts elsewhere in Africa, and growing numbers of inter-
nally displaced people (IDP) due to ongoing instability. The
number of IDPs remained high in 2013 (UNHCR, 2013).
In addition to experiencing prolonged conflict, South
Sudan is also prone to natural disasters; a National Baseline
Mugo et al. 7
Household Survey conducted in 2009 found that 56% of the
population suffered from drought or floods (GoSS, 2011).
Funding/international aid environment.In the presence of
recurrent violence and instability in South Sudan, several
key funding programs were ended simultaneously and
replaced by less generous programs (Downie, 2012). The
MDTF, which had covered several key health initiatives in
South Sudan, was operationally closed on December 31,
2012, and financially closed at the end of June 2013 (Inde-
pendent Evaluation of the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for South
Sudan [MDTF-SS], 2013). The MDTF marshalled the finan-
cial resources of several external donors, but concerns
regarding ongoing funding remain. The MDTF contributed
to establishing and strengthening state institutions and
expanded public services and delivery. One identified prob-
lem was the transition from the Rapid Impact Emergency
Project (RIEP) to more sustainable services and systems
(Independent Evaluation of the MDTF-SS, 2013).
South Sudan was due to receive a US$130 million credit
from the World Bank Group's Fund for the poorest countries,
the International Development Association (IDA; World
Bank, 2013), as well as funding and support from several
other sources including United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) and Department for
International Development, UK (DFID; MoH, n.d.). It was
hoped that some oil revenues would also be directed to
MNCH, given its focus within the National Health Plan
(Downie, 2012; Rai, Ramadhan, & Tulchinsky, 2012).
Adequate levels of sustained funding are vital to improving
health outcomes (Zwi, 2011).
To better coordinate health service delivery between the
ranges of stakeholders in South Sudan, a "division of labour"
has been implemented, based on geographical coverage
among three key health development partners: USAID,
DFID, and the World Bank. Stakeholders involved in the
financing and provision of health services in South Sudan
include health development partners, international NGOs,
national NGOs, faith-based organisations, and the private
sector (MoH, n.d.).
Coordination, fragmentation, and aid effectiveness. Before inde-
pendence, health assistance to South Sudan was character-
ised as being "supply driven" (Downie, 2012, p. 11). Like
many conflict-affected states, development partners and
NGOs provided fragmented services suited to their own
interests, covering selected regions. Fox and Manu (2012)
suggest that coordination by the major development partners
in South Sudan improved following a geographic division of
responsibility for health assistance among development
partners.
Promoting aid effectiveness is a significant issue given
prior history of fragmentation and poor coordination. Global
attention to development effectiveness has led to attention
being focused on issues such as national ownership, mutual
accountability, transparency, and coordination--all relevant
to more effective aid. Debates concerning this broader aid
and development context simultaneously offer guidance and
place pressure on both the South Sudanese government and
its development partners to promote better practice.
South Sudan is a founding member of the g7+, an inter-
governmental organization of "fragile" and "post"-conflict
states. It draws on the New Deal for engagement in fragile
states, a declaration concerning how best to progress devel-
opment in the least developed states with the support of the
international community (Dyori, n.d.). The New Deal (g7+,
2011) offers guidance on engagement between fragile states
and their development partners, and specifically sets out
objectives concerning the achievement of five peace- and
state-building goals as the foundation for progressing the
MDG targets. These include promoting "legitimate politics,"
security, justice, economic foundations, and revenues and
services. South Sudan is piloting the New Deal and com-
pleted its first fragility assessment in late 2012, the first ele-
ment of the "pathway out of fragility" (Ministry of Finance
and Economic Planning, 2012).
Maternal and Child Health Service-Related
Challenges
Access. Delays in seeking medical care are a significant fac-
tor contributing to maternal deaths (Geller, Cox, Callaghan,
& Berg, 2006; Mathai, 2008), and women with obstetric
complications in LMIC, such as South Sudan, face numerous
barriers to access (Barkat, Rahman, Bose, Com, & Akhter,
1997; Mbaruku, van Roosmalen, Kimondo, Bilango, &
Bergström, 2009), as outlined below.
Geographical
Pregnant women in South Sudan often experience consider-
able time delays when trying to reach a health facility for
treatment (Karoshi & Keith, 2009; Sivaganesh & Senarath,
2009). Geographic barriers impede women with obstetric
complications from accessing emergency obstetric care
(Borghi, Ensor, Somanathan, Lissner, & Mills, 2006).Access
is generally worse in rural than urban areas, and 83% of the
population in South Sudan is rural (South Sudan National
Bureau of Statistics, 2012). Women in South Sudan may
travel long distances by foot to reach health centers (Murphy,
2007), as many villages do not have road access and families
do not have access to vehicles or public transportation. It
may take literally days for women with life-threatening con-
ditions to reach a health care facility; many women die from
treatable complications.
Financial
The cost of receiving health care is another major constraint
in South Sudan, due to the need for transportation, physician
8 SAGE Open
and facility fees, and the cost of medications and other medi-
cal supplies (Borghi et al., 2006). Pregnant women may be
seen by community members as a "burden" due to the high
costs, often unaffordable by families, associated with child-
birth. The government has committed to free services in the
public sector (GoSS, 2011); however, under-the-counter
payments have been reported, which will require ongoing
monitoring (Rajkotia et al., 2007), and, as in other settings,
time lost seeking money to pay for care may delay access to
crucial services and lead to loss of life (Lewis, 2003; Prata
et al., 2010).
Cultural and Social
At a global level, achieving the MDG targets relies heavily
on women's empowerment and equal access to education,
work, health care, and decision making, yet MDG 3, con-
cerning the promotion of gender equality and empowerment
of women, remains largely unfulfilled (UN, 2012). Women
in rural areas often do not have the power to seek, receive, or
communicate around health issues, including information
that can help prevent maternal mortality such as safe abor-
tion, family planning, and antenatal care (Lewis, 2003). Girls
continue to be discriminated against with respect to educa-
tion at all levels, yet education enables women to gain the
knowledge, confidence, skills, and opportunities to increase
their social and economic status in their household and in
society (Gill, Pande, & Malhotra, 2007). Educated women
have better health outcomes; for each additional year of edu-
cation achieved by 1,000 women, two maternal deaths will
be prevented (World Bank, 2002).
Gender inequalities and discrimination lie at the root of
child marriage, common in South Sudan. The most recent
Household Health Survey indicated that 7.3% of girls are
married before 15 years of age, and 45.2% before 18 (MoH
& National Bureau of Statistics, 2013). Early marriage has
harmful consequences associated with risks of pregnancy,
sexual violence, and sexually transmitted infections includ-
ing HIV. Pregnancy and delivery are particularly dangerous
for adolescents, who have a five times greater risk of dying
in childbirth than women in their 20s (WHO &UNFPA,
2006).
The contraceptive prevalence rate among married women
or those in other unions is particularly low in South Sudan,
reflecting the high levels of illiteracy and lack of education
about reproductive health and family planning (Rajkotia et
al., 2007; WHO, 2009). Even with education opportunities,
women, and especially adolescents, often lack access to con-
sistently and appropriately stocked family planning services
and distribution points (Aquilina et al., 2006). South Sudan
has high fertility rates, estimated at 6.7 births per woman
(MoH, 2011), which exacerbate the high risk of maternal
death (MoH & National Bureau of Statistics, 2013; New
Sudan Center for Statistics and Evaluation & UNICEF,
2004).
Gender inequality is also high in South Sudan, and gen-
der-based violence widespread (Learning on Gender and
ConflictinAfrica,2012;WorldBank,2013).TheIndependent
Evaluation of the MDTF-SS (2013) found that gender
inequality was not a Task Force priority during initial imple-
mentation phases, and it was not until 2009 that it received
proper attention. Addressing gender inequalities has now
been identified as a key priority in South Sudan (GoSS,
2011; MoH & GoSS, 2011).
There are many forms of traditional practice in South
Sudan, and much health-seeking behavior relates to tradi-
tional medicine. Traditional healers are often sought due to
personal beliefs, or because no other means of health care is
available or accessible (MoH, 2009). According to the
National Baseline Household Survey 2009, 47% of the house-
hold population in South Sudan that does not have access to a
health care facility seeks help from traditional healers (South
Sudan National Bureau of Statistics, 2012). South Sudan is
home to more than 60 ethnic groups (Jok, 2011; Kimenyi,
2012), held together primarily by their shared struggle and
collective opposition to the north (Jok, 2011). Health-seeking
behavior in general, and for these varied groups, remains
inadequately understood (MoH & GoSS, 2011; National
Population Council, 2010), and a key objective of the 2011-
2015 Health Sector Development Plan is to improve access
to, and the delivery of, quality primary health services
through, among other things, mobilising the community
around appropriate health care seeking (MoH & GoSS, 2011).
Applying multi-faceted concepts of access to primary
health care, as elaborated by Levesque, Harris, and Russell
(2013), will be helpful in identifying enablers that should be
supported and barriers that need to be addressed.
Health facilities and human resources for health.Human
resources for health (HRH) play a pivotal role in the avail-
ability, accessibility, and equity of health services. The avail-
ability of skilled birth attendants able to detect, prevent, and
manage obstetric complications as well as to provide drugs,
equipment, and other supplies is the single most important
factor in preventing maternal deaths (Rosenfield & Schwartz,
2005). South Sudan's health worker density is far lower than
the minimum threshold recommended by the WHO (Gupta
et al., 2011). In 2009-2010, there were a reported total of 189
physicians across 8 states (a doctor/population ratio of
1:65,574) and 309 midwives (a midwife/population ratio of
1:39,088; MoH, 2010). Figures vary however, with other
sources suggesting 1 midwife for every 125,000 women
(Kolok, 2013).
South Sudan has experienced a critical shortage of skilled
human resources in all sectors, including health (MoH &
GoSS, 2011). Development of institutional and human
resource capacity is a stated government priority (MoH,
2010), and although innovative training of frontline health
workers has commenced, considerable constraints remain
(Fehling et al., 2013).
Mugo et al. 9
Even when women do have the means of reaching a health
service, inadequate numbers of high quality services and facil-
ities (and insufficient numbers of qualified personnel to staff
the services) can increase delays and raise the risk of maternal
mortality. Delays can occur when facilities do not have the
capacity to perform basic services, which can put women with
emergency complications at heightened risk of maternal mor-
tality (Karoshi & Keith, 2009). Poor maternal health outcomes
in South Sudan are strongly connected to poor prenatal, deliv-
ery, and postnatal care services in health facilities (Rai et al.,
2012), and inadequate links between the community and the
first level of the referral system significantly increase the risk
of maternal death for women. Health facilities in South Sudan
often also face chronic shortages of medicines and other nec-
essary supplies. Medicines are supplied through the MoH,
however transportation to facilities, and storage within these
facilities, remains a significant challenge (Ministry of Health
& Government of South Sudan, 2011).
Health service providers in "post"-conflict settings need
to understand and be sensitive to the differing community
perspectives around health and health care, and of the impor-
tance of building trust in health services (Zwi, Bunde-
Birouste, Grove, Waller, & Ritchie, 2006). They must also be
sensitive to historical inequalities, socio-cultural and eco-
nomic developments, and eroded trust that might be present
(Schweitzer et al., 2012).
Discussion
This review has reflected on the widespread MNCH needs
and challenges in South Sudan. The civil war fractured social
structures, displaced millions of people, destroyed much of
the physical infrastructure, and led to the collapse of the pub-
lic health system, resulting in high morbidity and mortality
(GoSS, 2011). Despite efforts by the GoSS and the interna-
tional community, South Sudan remains far from achieving
the MDGs, a major challenge in all "fragile" and conflict-
affected states. A broad and comprehensive approach to
addressing population-based MNCH is required, along with
ongoing support to developing institutions and systems.
Priority Areas
Three priority areas emerge from this narrative review: (a)
addressing the macro-political and "post"-conflict security
and development context, (b) focusing on the key determi-
nants of health, and (c) building the health system, its capac-
ity, and its capabilities, with the support of the international
community. These priorities are interrelated and should be
simultaneously considered in addressing MNCH needs,
though are discussed separately below.
Macro-political and "post"-conflict security and development con-
text.South Sudan and other "fragile" and "post"-conflict
states have shown least progress toward meeting MDG tar-
gets and exhibit the most pressing health and development
needs. The conflict-to-peace transition and the challenges of
nation building are fundamental, requiring deep and sus-
tained commitment by both government and development
partners. These are mutually reinforcing--charting a vision
for the country's development and establishing a sense of
security and stability along with effective governance are
central to securing international community support and
engagement.
The debate around the MDG targets and the development
goals being formulated for the post-2015 period highlight the
search for solutions to some of the most complex develop-
ment needs. This debate, however, also provides some
opportunity and space, in part in association with the g7+ and
other "fragile" and "post"-conflict states, to highlight the
specificity of their needs alongside their commitment to
addressing the development deficit present within their
countries. Nascent local civil society, along with engaged
global civil society, will play an important part in keeping
this debate alive and accountability in focus (The World We
Want, 2013).
Key determinants that influence health outcomes.This narra-
tive review highlights the poor health status and MNCH out-
comes in South Sudan, and draws attention to the need to
address the determinants of health if improved outcomes are
to be achieved. Despite the many obstacles and challenges in
South Sudan, peace and security, and addressing basic needs
of nutrition, shelter, employment, and water and sanitation,
among others, require attention. Gender equality, and the
education of girls and women, is vital and requires high lev-
els of government commitment and leadership, as "low rates
of primary school completion and high gender disparities
pose enormous challenges to the development of South
Sudan" (UNICEF, 2011). The South Sudan Household
Health Surveys of 2006 and 2010 demonstrate that women
with more years of schooling have both higher levels of
knowledge about health and better health outcomes, as do
their families.
The UN-led Consultation on Health in the Post-2015
Agenda emphasised that the most disadvantaged, margin-
alised, stigmatised, and hard-to-reach populations in all
countries must be prioritised, and equity must be made
explicit in the post-2015 goals (The World We Want, 2013).
This echoes broader calls for the more central role of rights
within this agenda and the focus on reducing disparities and
inequalities. That report also recognised that the goal of
achieving universal health access must improve governance
and access to decision making, as well as reduce those barri-
ers that relate to gender, income level, and geography (The
World We Want, 2013). Improving upstream interventions
must complement those operating through health systems
and services.

Improved health system and services.This article brings
together an extensive range of insights into health system
functioning, performance, and challenges in South Sudan.
Ongoing conflict has a detrimental impact on health status
and health system development, although considerable
efforts are now underway to try and move beyond the "post"-
conflict challenges and to consolidate nation building. A
major element of this agenda is establishing and maintaining
effective services operating within a broader health and
development policy with long-term objectives. We have
highlighted the key challenges present, with an emphasis on
applying what is already known to be effective in improving
and securing MNCH outcomes for populations in LMICs.
Informing policy with evidence (Bowen & Zwi, 2005)
requires acute sensitivity to local context. Applying well-
established guidance and policies, building and working with
trustworthy and committed development partners, is likely to
be an essential component of this long-term effort.
The literature highlights the lack of skilled MNCH ser-
vice providers as the greatest obstacle to achieving improved
MNCH in South Sudan (Nelson et al., 2011), with the major-
ity of births still attended by family or friends rather than a
trained provider, and delays in seeking medical care contrib-
uting to maternal deaths. Human resources for health are
critically low in South Sudan and require ongoing invest-
ment and commitment to building institutions. Fujita et al.
(2013) examined the role of midwives in addressing high
maternal mortality in "post"-conflict Cambodia, and high-
lighted the importance of political commitment, high level
leadership, capable mid-level managers, and supportive
development partners, if systems and institutions are to be
built on an effective and sustainable basis. These all apply to
South Sudan.
The health and humanitarian situation in South Sudan,
with particular reference to MNCH, requires substantial
financial and technical assistance from the international
community (Rai et al., 2012). Rai et al. (2012) indicate that
technical support should include establishing good gover-
nance practices, creating a conducive environment for pooled
funding and programs, and establishing an accountability
framework. Zwi (2011) argues that the seven "sins" associ-
ated with "aid" funding should be carefully avoided in rela-
tion to development assistance for health; these include
being patient, being more generous, and committing to lon-
ger-term building of institutions. Health systems and ser-
vices should also take into account general lessons learned;
according to the Independent Evaluation of the MDTF-SS
(2013), recommendations for successful projects included
the following:
a. strong national leadership;
b. careful preparation, with realistic development objec-
tives and implementation schedules;
c. recognition of capacity constraints of national imple-
menting institutions;
d. avoiding top-down approaches;
e. integrating risk assessment and mitigation measures
into the design; and
f. establishing a robust field implementation presence,
with management oversight, and regular engagement
with national counterparts.
The South Sudan health sector development plan (MoH &
GoSS, 2011) notes the importance of monitoring, evaluation,
and operational research. Enhancing our understanding of
context--historical, cultural, political, economic, and devel-
opmental--and of current capacity and its constraints will be
important to assuring appropriate support and capability
strengthening.
Post-2015 Agenda
Several issues reflected in the Thematic Consultations for the
post-2015 development agenda are acutely relevant to South
Sudan: the need to focus on health and related inequalities
and disparities, the importance of recognising specific con-
texts such as conflict and fragility, the centrality of universal
health coverage, and the associated right to health.
Innovations on the ground and the role of civil society and
responsiveness to the community also receive attention.
The Thematic Consultation highlighted the importance of
gender equality, accountability, and sustainability as guiding
principles for the new development agenda. It argued that
MDG health priorities would continue to feature in the post-
2015 agenda given the importance of women's and children's
health, HIV, and other infectious diseases especially in SSA
(The World We Want, 2013). A DFID evaluation of the Basic
Services Fund in South Sudan (Johnson, Ockelford, &
Power, 2013) found that gender equity had not been suffi-
ciently highlighted; addressing this gap will be core to
enhancing health and development. The post-2015 develop-
ment framework should be more "people-centred and rights-
based . . . " with goals and indicators with "universal
relevance . . .", while highlighting the importance of country
context (The World We Want, 2013).
Conclusion
This narrative review has sought to contextualise the MNCH
challenges in "post"-conflict South Sudan. We have high-
lighted ongoing constraints, barriers, and impediments to
improving health outcomes across the MNCH continuum.
We draw attention to these within the broad context of inter-
national community support to "post"-conflict states and
have highlighted opportunities arising as a result of South
Sudanese independence, commitment to the MDGs, debates
around the post-2015 development agenda, and the emer-
gence of the g7+, which allows South Sudan to engage with
its peers and develop shared objectives and frameworks for
nation building.
Mugo et al. 11
We emphasise a number of core challenges that remain--
securing the peace and building macro-economic and politi-
cal stability; addressing the determinants of health; and
building services and systems that are attuned to the realities
on the ground. Much remains to be done, however, and sus-
tained, multi-layered, and dependable support are required if
advances for MNCH are to be achieved in South Sudan.
