Characteristics of Hypertension in
Young Adults With Autosomal Dominant
Polycystic Kidney Disease Compared
With the General U.S. Population
Catherine L. Kelleher, Kim K. McFann, Ann M. Johnson, and Robert W. Schrier
Background: Patients with autosomal dominant poly-
cystic kidney disease (ADPKD) often develop hyperten-
sion before any abnormalities in renal function are
detected clinically. Therefore, standard screening (serum
creatinine and urinalysis) of young individuals with unex-
plained hypertension to exclude renal parenchymal disease
would rarely detect ADPKD.
Methods: Data from 516 subjects with ADPKD (217
male and 299 female), aged newborn to 55 years with a
normal serum creatinine and no proteinuria based on urine
dipstick, studied between 1985 and 2000, were compared
with data from similar subjects from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (1988­
1994) and NHANES IV (1999­2000) data, by gender.
Results: There was a highly significant occurrence of
hypertension in young patients with ADPKD when com-
pared to patients aged 20 to 34 years in the U.S. popula-
tion. The hypertension in patients with ADPKD occurred
in the absence of abnormal renal function or abnormal
urinalysis.
Conclusions: These data indicate that renal ultrasound
screening of young hypertensive individuals (aged 20 to
34 years) should be considered when searching for causes
of secondary hypertension. Identifying affected ADPKD
individuals early in their disease will permit aggressive
blood pressure treatment and early inhibition of the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system, which has been shown to
reverse left ventricular hypertrophy, an important cardio-
vascular risk factor. In the present era of renal replacement
therapy, cardiovascular complications are the main cause
of death in patients with ADPKD. Am J Hypertens 2004;

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
(ADPKD) is the most frequent life-threatening
hereditary disease, occurring in 1 in 400 to 1000
people of European descent.1,2 This disease is more fre-
quent than sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, muscular
dystrophy, hemophilia, Down's syndrome, and Hunting-
ton's disease combined,3 and accounted for 2.3% of end-
stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States between
the years 1997 and 2001.4 Efforts to slow the progression
of this disease and delay the need for renal replacement
therapy are being investigated clinically and at the basic
science level. From a clinical perspective, it is important to
identify treatable risk factors associated with early pro-
gression in the course of the disease. Several factors that
predict a more rapid deterioration of renal function include
age, male gender, gross hematuria, proteinuria, type 1
gene mutations on chromosome 16 compared with type 2
mutations on chromosome 4, renal cyst volume, hyperten-
sion, increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI), and
African American ethnicity.5­9
Of these risk factors for renal dysfunction in ADPKD,
hypertension is the only treatable condition identified to
date. Moreover, hypertension in patients with ADPKD is
associated with a high incidence of left ventricular hyper-

trophy.10 Left ventricular hypertrophy is a known risk
factor for cardiovascular complications, which are now the
most common cause of death in patients with ADPKD.11
Studies of hypertension in patients with ADPKD have
implicated increased activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldo-
sterone system (RAAS).12­14 A prospective randomized
study showed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors re-
versed left ventricular hypertrophy to a greater extent than
calcium channel blockers in patients with ADPKD.15 More-
over, in the same study, aggressive control of blood pressure
(BP) (120/80 mm Hg) in patients with ADPKD was asso-
ciated with reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy to a
greater extent than standard BP control (135 to 140/85 to
90 mm Hg).15 The recent improvement in BP control in
patients with ADPKD16 is associated with a later onset of
ESRD in both men and women with ADPKD.17
Therefore, early identification of individuals with AD-
PKD is imperative to allow aggressive treatment of hy-
pertension. Although family history is helpful in
identifying affected individuals, on questioning only 60%
of patients with ADPKD reveal a positive family history.18
In this article, we explore the specific characteristics of
hypertension in young patients with ADPKD as compared
with hypertension in young individuals in the general U.S.
population. With the recent availability of the fourth
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES IV), the epidemiology of hypertension in the
United States is accessible and current. With the goal of
early diagnosis, the purpose of the present study was to
analyze the incidence of hypertension in patients with
ADPKD versus hypertension in the U.S. population, par-
ticularly between the ages of 20 and 34 years.
Methods
Study Population
From June 1985 to December 2000, a total of 828 adults
and children with ADPKD without ESRD participated in a
longitudinal study at the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center to define the natural history of ADPKD.
All protocols were approved by the Colorado Multiple
Institutional Review Board, and all subjects provided writ-
ten informed consent. Of the 828 subjects, 516 met the
following inclusion criteria for analysis: 1) one full exam-
ination at the University of Colorado General Clinical
Research Center (GCRC), 2) a normal serum creatinine
concentration (1.2 mg/dL for women; 1.5 mg/dL for
men), 3) a normal dipstick protein (0 or trace; 11 subjects
missing dipstick data but with urinary protein excretion
300 mg/24 h were included), 4) age less than 55 years,
5) not of the African American ethnicity, and 6) subjects
were not in another hypertension treatment study. Of the
516 ADPKD patients, 123 were the only member in their
family in the study and the other 393 patients had an
ADPKD relative in the study. The data analyzed were
from the subjects' first study visit and reflect care before
study participation.
A complete medical history and physical examination
were performed at the initial study visit to the GCRC.
Blood pressures were measured by trained nurses using a
Dinamap apparatus (Critikon Inc., Tampa, FL). In adults,
hypertension was defined as mean systolic BP 140 mm
Hg or mean diastolic BP 90 mm Hg while sitting or on
antihypertensive medication with a previous diagnosis of
hypertension. In children (18 years), hypertension was
defined as greater than 50% of measured systolic or dia-
stolic BPs above the 95th percentile for age-, gender-, and
height-matched children.19
Laboratory data obtained at this initial GCRC visit
included routine serum chemistries and two 24-h urine
collections to measure protein excretion. Urinary protein
concentrations were determined by the Coumassie blue
dye-binding method. The mean of the two collections was
used to assess each individual's level of proteinuria (in
milligrams per 24 hours).
Data from patients with ADPKD (ages newborn to 55
years) collected from 1985 to 2000 were compared with
NHANES data from two time periods: 1988 to 1994
(NHANES III; 2958 male and 3249 female subjects) and
1999 to 2000 (NHANES IV; 2602 male and 2834 female
subjects). The NHANES data were obtained from four
sources: 1) a table published by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention,20 2) published analysis of
NHANES data,21 and 3) raw data files from NHANES III
and NHANES IV made available to the public.22,23 The
NHANES III data (1988­1994) were compared with
ADPKD data from 1985 through 1994; the years 1985 to
1987 were included in the ADPKD data to have sufficient
sample size for comparison. Similarly, the NHANES IV
data (1999­2000) were compared with ADPKD data from
1995 through 2000. The presence of hypertension in chil-
dren (aged newborn to 19 years) could only be compared
with the NHANES IV data, as the NHANES III data were
incomplete for children. Similarly, NHANES IV data were
used for comparisons of BP control and treatment, as these
data were not available in NHANES III. The NHANES
studies include subjects with secondary hypertension, but
presumably 90% to 95% of the subjects have essential
hypertension.
Statistical Analyses
The 2 test of independence was used to identify gender
differences regarding the prevalence and treatment of hy-
pertension among patients with ADPKD. Continuous vari-
ables were compared with Student t test. Because
significant gender differences were identified, all subse-
quent analyses were performed separately for male and
female subjects. The 2 tests of independence were per-
formed to compare the ADPKD patients with the general
U.S. population (NHANES data) with regard to differ-
ences in the percentage with hypertension, the percentage
with BP controlled at or below 140/90 mm Hg, and the

were considered significant at the .05 level.
Results
Comparison of ADPKD Male
and Female Patients
Five hundred sixteen subjects with ADPKD were included
in the analysis, 217 males and 219 females (Table 1). Only
7% of the subjects were documented to have been
screened for ADPKD because of hypertension; the reason
for the ADPKD diagnosis was unknown in 28%. Of the
516 subjects in the study, 191 (37%) had a history of
hypertension or were hypertensive at the time of the study
visit. Of the 516 subjects, 393 had a relative in the study
and 123 did not. Inclusion of this information did not alter
the conclusions of the study. A significantly higher per-
centage of ADPKD males than females were hypertensive
(Fig. 1), with greater gender differences noted between the
ages of 20 and 44 years. Because of these differences,
subsequent analyses were separated by gender.
Prevalence of Hypertension in ADPKD
Subjects Versus the U.S. Population
The prevalence of hypertension in subjects with ADPKD
in our database was compared with the prevalence of
hypertension in the white U.S. population as reported in
the NHANES studies for two time periods. The first period
is depicted in Fig. 2. Dramatic differences are shown in the
prevalence of hypertension in male and female subjects
with ADPKD compared with male and female individuals
in the general white U.S. population for all age groups.
The more recent results are depicted in Fig. 3. Differences
are seen in each group under the age of 45 years, but the
most dramatic differences are seen in the 20- to 34-year
age group.

The percentage of male and female hypertensive subjects
with BP controlled at or below 140/90 mm Hg in the
ADPKD and NHANES IV subjects are shown in Fig. 4A.
A significantly greater percentage of ADPKD subjects had
their BP controlled (for both genders) as compared with
the U.S. white population.
The percentages of both male and female hypertensive
subjects receiving antihypertensive therapy in the ADPKD

receiving antihypertensive treatment; however, this differ-
ence was significant only in women.
Discussion
Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor affect-
ing 50 to 60 million U.S. residents.24 Autosomal dominant
polycystic kidney disease is associated with hypertension
in a large percentage of cases.25 At present, with the
availability of renal replacement therapy (dialysis and
renal transplantation), the major cause of death in patients
with ADPKD is cardiovascular events.11 The observation
that nearly 50% of hypertensive ADPKD subjects (mean
age 41 years) exhibit left ventricular hypertrophy10 sug-
gests that untreated hypertension has been present for a
considerable time. This is not unexpected given that hy-
pertension occurs early in ADPKD and precedes any de-
cline in renal function.25 Aggressive BP control (120/80
mm Hg) in patients with ADPKD more effectively re-
verses left ventricular hypertrophy than standard BP con-
trol.15 Moreover, improvement in BP control and the use
of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been
associated with later onset of ESRD in both male and
female subjects with ADPKD.17
Unexplained hypertension in young individuals be-
tween the ages of 20 to 34 years generally leads to a
workup for secondary causes of hypertension, as recom-
mended by the Joint National Committee on Prevention,
Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pres-
sure (JNC) VII.26 A normal serum creatinine, absence of
proteinuria by dipstick, and clear urinary sediment are
measured to exclude renal parenchymal disease. However,
these criteria would miss the diagnosis of ADPKD in
young individuals where hypertension occurs before pro-
teinuria or a decrease in renal function.
Because ADPKD has an autosomal dominant pattern of
inheritance, one parent usually has the disease. However,
on questioning, 40% of ADPKD patients do not have a
family history compatible with ADPKD.18 This may occur
because the disease is mild in other affected family mem-
bers and they did not develop symptoms to prompt a
diagnostic evaluation. It may also occur because the pa-

tient has a spontaneous new mutation (de novo mutation)
not present in previous generations that may be passed on
to the offspring.
The occurrence of ADPKD in the United States is
between 1 in 400 to 1000 individuals; thus, as many as
500,000 to 600,000 Americans are affected with AD-
PKD.18 It is now clear that sensitive renal ultrasound
studies can diagnose ADPKD, even in utero.18 Neverthe-
less, such an early diagnostic approach is generally only
undertaken in the presence of a family history of ADPKD,
an elevated serum creatinine, or an abnormal urinalysis.
Early diagnosis of ADPKD with widespread renal ul-
trasound screening of all 50 to 60 million hypertensive
patients in the United States in the absence of a family
history of ADPKD is neither cost effective nor practical.
The presence of microalbuminuria, an amount of urinary
albumin excretion that is not detected by commercial
dipsticks, has been shown to be correlated with a high
incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with
ADPKD.7 However, detection of microalbuminuria in
young hypertensive patients would not be specific for
ADPKD. Only renal imaging has been shown to be spe-
cific and sensitive for the diagnosis of ADPKD in young
individuals.27,28 The diagnosis of ADPKD in individuals
less than 30 years old is made by either the presence of
two cysts (unilateral or bilateral) together with a positive
family history for ADPKD or the presence of five cysts
bilaterally in the absence of a family history of ADPKD.
In addressing this important issue, the results of the
present study were analyzed separately for men and
women because of the greater predilection of hypertension
in men as compared to premenopausal women. The results
in the NHANES IV (1999­2000) data as compared to
patients with ADPKD clearly demonstrate that the inci-
dence of hypertension between the ages of 20 and 34 years
is 49% in the ADPKD population versus approximately
7% in the general U.S. population. The challenge is to
identify ADPKD in young hypertensive individuals with-
out a known family history and during a period when these
individuals often have normal renal function and a normal
urinalysis.
The present results also show that BP control (140/90
mm Hg) in patients with ADPKD is improved compared
with BP control in the general U.S. hypertensive popula-
tion. The educational approaches in place for ADPKD
patients may account for this difference.16 The percentage
of patients receiving antihypertensive medications was
greater in patients with ADPKD than in the NHANES IV
subjects (although only significantly different for women).
However, treatment patterns probably do not completely
explain the difference in control. Because the RAAS is
activated in patients with ADPKD more than in patients
with essential hypertension,13 the recent increased use of
inhibitors of the RAAS may contribute to improved BP
control in patients with ADPKD.16
African American subjects were excluded from the
present study because too few African American subjects
with ADPKD were enrolled to generate data for a separate
comparison with the NHANES data. Autosomal dominant
polycystic kidney disease, however, does affect African
Americans5 and more studies in this population are nec-
essary.
Screening young hypertensive patients for ADPKD
(34 years of age) who have a standard negative workup
for other common secondary causes of hypertension, in-
cluding other renal parenchymal diseases, primary hyper-
aldosteronism, and renal vascular disease, with a renal
ultrasound would add approximately $300 to the costs.
Although ESRD due to ADPKD is estimated to cost $1.8
billion per year, an analysis of cost savings must await
documentation of an effective therapy to decrease or pre-
vent ESRD related to ADPKD. However, some patients
want to know whether they have a genetic disease because
it makes a difference in their decision making regarding
health care and family planning. On the other hand, some
individuals may not want to know because of insurance
eligibility issues. Given the increased incidence of cerebral
aneurysms,29 the diagnosis of ADPKD may also affect the
physician's response to neurological complaints. Early
diagnosis and aggressive treatment of hypertension offers
the potential to prevent development of left ventricular
hypertrophy and cardiovascular complications in patients
with ADPKD.6,10 Although hypertension in patients with
ADPKD correlates with increased renal volumes and more
rapid progression to ESRD, there is a need for an ade-
quately powered, prospective randomized study to evalu-
ate whether aggressive lowering of BP and blockade of the
RAAS will slow the progression of the renal disease. The
National Institutes of Health is supporting a 5-year multi-
center prospective randomized clinical trial (HALT poly-
cystic kidney disease) that will involve 1250 patients with
ADPKD. The hypothesis is that inhibition of the RAAS
with a combination of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme
inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker will be more
effective than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor
alone. The Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)
study, which had a 2.2-year average follow-up, included
200 patients with ADPKD but did not randomize the
patients in relation to their antihypertensive medications.30
No improvement in renal function was observed with
more aggressive BP control but the study may have been
underpowered.
In summary, the results of the present study indicate
that when the diagnostic workup for a secondary cause of
hypertension in patients between the ages of 20 and 34
years is negative, even in the presence of a normal serum
creatinine and urinalysis and a negative family history, the
physician still should consider the possibility of ADPKD.
This diagnosis can be confirmed in nearly 100% of pa-
tients with ADPKD by age 30 years with a renal ultra-
sound. The potential prevention of cardiovascular
complications by early intervention with blockade of the
RAAS and a lower BP goal of 125/75 mm Hg may
decrease morbidity and mortality. Although uncontrolled
1033

hypertension may accelerate progression of most renal
diseases, the role of aggressive BP control and blockade of
the RAAS in the renal progression of ADPKD must await
the HALT PKD results.
