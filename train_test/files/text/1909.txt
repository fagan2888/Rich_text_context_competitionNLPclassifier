Objective: To examine young adult outcomes in a na-
tionally representative US cohort of young adults grow-
ing up with a chronic illness.
Design: Secondary analysis of nationally representa-
tive data from wave III (in 2001) of the National Longi-
tudinal Study of Adolescent Health.
Setting: United States.
Participants: The analytic sample comprised 13 236
young adults aged 18 to 28 years at wave III.
Main Exposure: Self-report of a chronic physical ill-
ness(asthma,cancer,diabetesmellitus,orepilepsy)inado-
lescence. Respondents with asthma or nonasthmatic
chronic illness (cancer, diabetes mellitus, or epilepsy) were
compared with individuals without these conditions.
Main Outcome Measures: Self-report of high school
graduation, ever having employment, currently having
employment, living with a parent/guardian, and ever re-
ceiving public assistance.
Results: Three percent of young adults had nonasth-
matic chronic illness (cancer, diabetes, or epilepsy), and
16.0% had asthma. Most young adults with chronic ill-
ness graduated high school (81.3%) and currently had em-
ployment(60.4%).However,comparedwithhealthyyoung
adults, those with nonasthmatic chronic illness were sig-
nificantly less likely to graduate high school, ever have had
employment,orcurrentlyhaveemploymentandweremore
likely to receive public assistance. Compared with young
adults with asthma, those with nonasthmatic chronic ill-
ness again had significantly worse young adult outcomes
on all measures.
Conclusions: Most young adults growing up with a
chronic illness graduate high school and have employ-
ment. However, these young adults are significantly less
likely than their healthy peers to achieve these impor-
tant educational and vocational milestones.

gests relationships between chronic illness in childhood
and higher rates of unemployment, receipt of Supplemen-
tal Security Income (SSI), and lower income, but find-
ings regarding the effect of childhood chronic illness on
high school graduation rates are inconsistent.
A major limitation of previous research is the inclu-
sion of young adults whose chronic illness was seasonal
allergies or asthma of uncertain severity. The inclusion
of seasonal allergies or asthma of uncertain severity with
more serious conditions reflects a noncategorical ap-
proach to childhood chronic illness, which is based on
the assumption that the effects of chronic illness are simi-
lar across disease categories. The noncategorical ap-
proach is well accepted; however, analytically combin-
ing common conditions with varying levels of severity,
such as asthma and seasonal allergies, with more severe
conditions may obscure the effects of more severe child-
hood chronic illness.1,14-16
This study examines 4 young adult outcomes that may
be associated with childhood chronic illness in partici-
pants in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (Add Health), a nationally representative US
sample. We consider the following outcomes: high school
graduation, employment history, current living situa-
tion, and receipt of public assistance. Based on previous
literature, we hypothesize that young adults with chronic
illness other than asthma have lower rates of high school
graduation and employment and are more likely to live
with their parent/guardian and to receive financial sup-
port from public programs. We also expect that young
adults who report having asthma (severity not known)
have outcomes similar to those of young adults without
chronic illness because much of this group will likely have
mild asthma.
METHODS
DATA
We used data from waves I and III of the Add Health contrac-
tual data set. Add Health is a nationally representative sample
of US adolescents enrolled in grades 7 through 12 in the 1994-
1995 school year (wave I). More than 90 000 children and ado-
lescents in 132 schools participated in the wave I in-school sur-
vey, with 20 745 respondents (aged 12-19 years) also completing
subsequent in-depth home interviews in the 1994-1995 school
year. Wave III follow-up interviews (n=15 170) were con-
ducted approximately 7 years after wave I, in 2001, with a 77%
response rate. As previously reported,17 total bias related to at-
trition is low (1%). More information regarding sampling pro-
cedures and study design can be found elsewhere.18 Inclusion
criteria for the present analysis were participation in waves I
and III (n=14 322) and complete data on all variables of inter-
est (n=13 236). Data regarding socioeconomic status and race/
ethnicity are drawn from wave I; the remainder of the mea-
sures are based on wave III.
MEASURES
Chronic Illness
At wave III, when respondents were aged 18 to 28 years, re-
spondents were asked whether they had ever been diagnosed
as having asthma, cancer, diabetes mellitus, or epilepsy; no other
childhood chronic illnesses were asked about in the survey. Re-
spondents who reported having asthma only were included in
the asthma group; respondents who reported at least 1 of the
other illnesses (regardless of whether they also had asthma) were
included in the nonasthmatic chronic illness group. All other
respondents were included in the healthy (no chronic illness)
group. It was not possible to separate those with mild asthma
fromthosewithmoresevereasthma,sothisheterogeneousgroup
was treated as a separate group. For analysis, dummy vari-
ables were created to indicate asthma, nonasthmatic chronic
illness, and healthy (reference). A dichotomous variable was
also created to compare the healthy group with participants with
any chronic illness, including asthma.
Young Adult Outcomes
Respondents were coded as high school graduates (1) if they
reported having a high school diploma or a GED (general equiva-
lency diploma) and as not high school graduates (0) if they had
neither. We included 2 indicators of vocational status: ever hav-
ing had full- or part-time employment and having current full-
or part-time employment. Each was coded as a dichotomous
variable (1=yes and 0=no).
Severaldichotomouseconomicoutcomeswereexamined:cur-
rently receiving support in the form of food stamps from the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and cur-
rently receiving disability insurance/workers' compensation/
unemployment benefits or SSI (1=yes and 0=no). In addition,
livingsituationwasassessedbasedonahouseholdrosterbygroup-
ing respondents who currently lived with a parent/guardian (1)
separately from those in other living situations (0).
Control Variables
All analyses included controls for factors that could indepen-
dently contribute to young adult outcomes: socioeconomic sta-
tus of family of origin, race/ethnicity, sex, and age. Socioeco-
nomic status was based on highest educational level for either
parent/guardian as reported by the child/adolescent at wave I;
dummy variables were created to code for less than high school,
high school graduate, some college, college graduate, and school-
ing beyond college, with less than high school as the reference
category. Race/ethnicity was based on wave I self-report and
was divided into non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, His-
panic, and other, with non-Hispanic white as the reference cat-
egory. Age at wave III was kept as a continuous variable. Sex
was coded as male (0) or female (1).
Data Analysis
Bivariate associations between outcome variables and illness
status were examined first across all 3 groups and then be-
tween groups using the 2 test. Multivariable Poisson regres-
sion was used to calculate risk ratios for dichotomous out-
comes, controlling for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and parent/
guardian educational level.19 Multivariate analyses were
conducted in multiple steps. In model 1, the nonasthmatic
chronic illness and asthma groups were each compared sepa-
rately with the healthy group. In model 2, the nonasthmatic
chronic illness group was compared with the asthma group.
Analyses were conducted using statistical software (Stata ver-
sion 11.0; StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas). Both models
adjusted for the clustered, stratified survey design, and sample
weights were applied to generate national population propor-
tional estimates.

RESULTS
PARTICIPANTS
Table 1 includes the sociodemographic characteristics
of the sample, the percentages in each illness group, and
the overall frequency of each outcome. Three percent of
the sample reported a nonasthmatic chronic illness (can-
cer, 116 [0.9%]; diabetes mellitus, 120 [0.9%]; and epi-
lepsy, 163 [1.2%]), 2111 (16.0%) reported having asthma,
and 10 726 (81.0%) reported none of these illnesses. The
mean (SD) age of the sample was 22.0 (0.16) years and
was the same across groups. Based on 2 tests, all socio-
demographic characteristics were significantly associ-
ated with illness category (results not shown).
ADULT OUTCOMES IN BIVARIATE ANALYSES
Table 2 displays bivariate associations between illness
groups and young adult outcomes, with significance test-
ing across all 3 groups shown. All outcomes, except liv-
ing with a parent/guardian, were associated with illness
category. Young adults with nonasthmatic chronic ill-
ness had the lowest rates of high school graduation, ever
having had employment, and currently having employ-
ment and the highest rates of receiving financial sup-
port from SNAP and SSI or disability insurance. The
asthma group, compared with the healthy group, had
slightly lower rates of currently having employment and
living with a parent/guardian and slightly higher rates of
ever having had employment and receiving support from
SNAP and SSI or disability insurance (Table 2).
ADULT OUTCOMES
IN MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS
In Table 3, we provide 2 models. The first model com-
pares the asthma group and the nonasthmatic chronic
illness group with the healthy group. The second model
comparestheasthmagroupwiththenonasthmaticchronic
illness group. The lower part of Table 3 displays asso-
ciations between control variables and young adult out-
comes as estimated in model 1. For model 1 there were
significant differences between young adults with non-
asthmatic chronic illness and their healthy peers for all
outcomes except living with a parent/guardian. Young
adults with nonasthmatic chronic illness were less likely
to graduate from high school, to ever have had employ-
ment, and to currently have employment and more likely
to receive SNAP support and SSI/disability insurance
(Table 3). There were no differences on any of the young
adult outcomes between those individuals with asthma
and their healthy peers except that those with asthma were
less likely to live with their parent/guardian.
Model 2 shows that the nonasthmatic chronic illness
group was significantly different from the asthma group
on all outcome variables. The nonasthmatic chronic ill-
ness group was less likely to have graduated high school,
to ever have had employment, and to currently have em-
ployment and more likely to receive support from SNAP,
to receive SSI/disability insurance, and to live with a par-
ent/guardian (Table 3).

diabetes mellitus, and epilepsy) had completed their high
school education, had current employment, and did not
receive financial assistance from programs such as SSI
or SNAP. However, compared with their healthy peers,
this group of young adults had poorer educational, vo-
cational, and financial outcomes. These findings are con-
sistent with other research and confirm in a nationally
representative US sample the negative association be-
tween childhood chronic illness and important young
adult outcomes. For example, the consequences of young
adults with chronic illness not graduating high school
has real-world significance because adults without a high
school diploma earn approximately $7000 less per year
than do those with a high school diploma.20
Asthma is the most prevalent chronic illness of child-
hood, and young adults with moderate to severe asthma
frequently have unmet health needs and require ongo-
ing medical care.21,22 However, studies that include asthma
or seasonal allergies in the chronic illness group with-
out considering severity may be underestimating the effect
of chronic illness on young adult outcomes. Studies based
on samples with large proportions of young adults with
asthma or allergies that do not take severity into ac-
count show less effect of chronic illness on educational
outcomes compared with studies that exclude those with
mild severity.9 Conversely, a Finnish case-control study
that included only moderate to severe asthma in the
chronic illness group showed lower educational attain-
ment and employment.7 The present findings from the
analysis of US young adults with chronic illness are con-
sistent in demonstrating the need to distinguish asthma
severity levels. In studies with fewer participants, smaller
differences that occur when asthma severity groups are
combined might not be detected; hence, including asthma
without considering severity may lead to an optimistic
bias regarding the young adult outcomes of those grow-
ing up with childhood chronic illness.
The noncategorical model for examining chronic ill-
ness is a valuable way of examining the outcomes of child-
hood chronic illness because there is a plausible com-
monpathwaybetweenhavingsignificantchildhoodchronic
illness and impaired young adult outcomes.1,15 There are
multiple mechanisms by which children with chronic ill-
ness might struggle to become successful young adults,
including educational problems related to missing school,
psychological distress related to health problems, and fam-
ily stress related to parental/guardian anxiety regarding a
child's health or finances.2,23-25 The exact mechanisms are
notyetknownandmaydifferbasedongenericanddisease-
specific characteristics. The present findings suggest that

it is important to consider illness severity when catego-
rizing individuals as having childhood chronic illness and
examining adult outcomes of illness.
These findings are particularly relevant to pediatri-
cians taking care of children with chronic illness who are
interested in supporting such patients in a successful tran-
sition to adulthood and adult medical care. The 2002
American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on
health care transitions acknowledges the role of physi-
cians in facilitating such transitions and notes the im-
portance of a close relationship between physician and
patient.26 To promote the broader success of children
growing up with chronic medical conditions, pediatri-
cians must recognize that these children are at in-
creased risk for poor educational, vocational, and finan-
cial outcomes as young adults.
The present analysis has several limitations. First, ow-
ing to data limitations, only 3 chronic illnesses could be
included in the nonasthmatic chronic illness group. It is
likely that there are more children with significant chronic
illnessthanthe3.0%identifiedbythepresentstudy.Ifother
chronic illnesses have similar implications for adult out-
comes, the differences documented herein between the
healthy and chronic illness groups may be underesti-
mates. Second, the present study did not take into ac-
countotherdetailsregardingthetiming,severity,andtreat-
ment of the conditions examined, which are all factors that
may affect young adult outcomes. Finally, there may be
mediatorsofyoungadultoutcomesthatarespecifictothose
growing up with diabetes mellitus, cancer, and epilepsy
and that have distinctive implications. For example, those
conditionscouldpotentiallyaffectcognitiveprocesses;cog-
nitive impairment would negatively affect the young adult
outcomes examined herein. This type of cognitive effect
contrasts with the more generic effects of growing up with
a chronic illness, such as increased family stress, finan-
cial distress, missed school, and altered peer relations,
which could affect young adult outcomes.27 Identifica-
tion of the salient mediators is needed to develop tar-
geted interventions that support young adults with chronic
illness as they enter adulthood.
Future study is needed to examine noncategorical and
disease-specific factors that affect the young adult out-
comes of those growing up with childhood chronic ill-
ness. Specific mediators, such as school absenteeism, cog-
nitive impairment, parent/guardian financial stress, and
psychiatric illness, warrant investigation. In addition, lon-
gitudinal studies are needed to examine the trajectories
that children with chronic illness follow as they move
from childhood/adolescence to adulthood. The mean age
of young adults in this study was 22 years; further study
of adult outcomes, such as college graduation, mar-
riage, and other long-term psychosocial and financial out-
comes, is needed.
In conclusion, most young adults with chronic ill-
ness graduate high school, are employed, and do not re-
ceive governmental financial assistance. However, the re-
sults of this study confirm the increased risk of poor
educational, vocational, and financial outcomes in young
adults with chronic illness. Continued efforts are needed
to support children growing up with chronic illness to
become successful adults, particularly interventions that
target educational attainment and vocational readiness.

problems.

Announcement
Trial Registration Required. In concert with the Inter-
national Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE),
Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine will re-
quire, as a condition of consideration for publication,
registration of all trials in a public trials registry (such as
http://ClinicalTrials.gov). Trials must be registered at or
before the onset of patient enrollment. This policy ap-
plies to any clinical trial starting enrollment after July 1,
2005. The trial registration number should be supplied
at the time of submission.
For details about this new policy, and for informa-
tion on how the ICMJE defines a clinical trial, see the
editorials by DeAngelis et al in the September 8, 2004
(2004;292:1363-1364) and June 15, 2005 (2005;293:
2927-2929) issues of JAMA. Also see the Instructions to
