Abstract
Significant public health problems associated with methamphetamine
(MA) production and use in the United States have emerged over the
past 25 years; however, there has been considerable controversy about
the size of the problem. Epidemiological indicators have provided a
mixed picture. National surveys of the adult U.S. population and school-
based populations have consistently been used to support the position
that MA use is a relatively minor concern. However, many other data
sources, including law-enforcement groups, welfare agencies, substance
abuse treatment program admissions, criminal justice agencies, and
state/county executives indicate that MA is a very significant public
health problem for many communities throughout much of the coun-
try. In this article, we describe (a) the historical underpinnings of the
MA problem, (b) epidemiological trends in MA use, (c) key subgroups at
risk for MA problems, (d ) the health and social factors associated with
MA use, (e) interventions available for addressing the MA problem, and
( f ) lessons learned from past efforts addressing the MA problem.

CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE
EPIDEMIOLOGY OF
METHAMPHETAMINE USE
Estimates of use and abuse of metham-
phetamine (MA) in the United States come
from several epidemiological sources that have
presented a mixed, controversial picture of the
problem. Statistics from the most widely cited
surveys, including the National Survey on Drug
Use and Health (NSDUH) and the Monitor-
ing the Future study (MTF) have consistently
shown that MA use is a relatively minor con-
cern among both adult and youth school-based
populations (43, 96). Specifically, trends in the
percentage of past-year MA use among persons
12 years and older has remained relatively sta-
ble, with estimates ranging from 0.7% in 2002
to 0.6% in 2007, with incidence rates (number
of persons aged 12 and older who had used
MA for the first time within the past year)
fluctuating from 299,000 persons in 2002, to
260,000 in 2003, to 318,000 in 2004, to 192,000
in 2005, to 259,000 in 2006, and to 157,000
in 2007 (96). Similarly, the MTF survey has
shown a decline in the annual prevalence of
MA use among youth in eighth, tenth, and
twelfth grades since 1999. Annual prevalence
rates of MA use among secondary students in
2008 were 1.2% for eighth graders, 1.5% for
tenth graders, and 1.2% for twelfth graders,
which are down considerably from rates in
1999 (3.2%, 4.6%, and 4.7%, respectively)
(43).
Clearly, these national-based surveys are a
valuable source of information on illicit drug
use among the general population; however,
individuals with illicit drug­related problems,
especially MA users, are often encountered on
the streets or in jails or prisons, in delinquent
camps and juvenile group homes, in hospitals
and emergency rooms, in publicly funded treat-
ment facilities, and in other informal systems
that provide social services. Fortunately, many
other data methods routinely collect informa-
tion about MA use and address national survey
limitations to provide a more complete picture
of MA use trends in the United States.
Data from other epidemiological indica-
tors, such as the Drug Abuse Warning Net-
work (DAWN), sponsored by the Substance
Abuse Mental Health Services Administra-
tion (SAMHSA), the National Institute on
Drug Abuse's Community Epidemiology Work
Group (CEWG), and SAMHSA's Treatment
Episode Data Set (TEDS), provide useful infor-
mation related to MA-related emergency room
episodes at hospitals, MA-related criminal jus-
tice encounters and referrals to jail, and MA-
related admissions to publicly funded treatment
facilities. Data from these sources (during the
early 1990s through 2005) present a picture
that contrasts with that portrayed by the na-
tional survey data (75). Foremost, admission
data from publicly funded treatment facilities
licensed by the 50 state drug abuse agencies that
receive federal funds demonstrate gradually es-
calating trends in MA use in the United States
through the 1990s and well into the twenty-first
century (see Figure 1) (97). Additionally, data
reported by DAWN, which provides statistical
estimates of drug-related visits to emergency
departments for 21 metropolitan areas across
the United States, indicate rising MA-related
visits (71). Furthermore, MA use has been a sub-
stantial problem for the criminal justice system
as reflected by law-enforcement data, includ-
ing arrests and seizures at the local level (67).
In fact, in 2005 alone, 39.2% of reporting state
and local law-enforcement agencies cited MA
as their greatest drug threat (66).
Since 2006, these data sources have begun
to show stabilizing or downward trends in MA
use at the local level (56), as reflected by law-
enforcement data (arrests and seizures) and
emergency room data from 20 of 22 metropoli-
tan areas. Similarly, as shown in Figure 1, treat-
ment admissions for MA showed a decline in
2006 for the first time. The wave of MA prob-
lems that penetrated most U.S. states during
the past decade and a half has been closely
linked to the availability of the ingredients
needed to make MA (77); such availability has
been halted through recent strict federal pre-
cursor control prevention efforts (2003­2006)

restricting retail sales of MA's main ingredient,
pseudoephedrine.
As with national surveys, despite the util-
ity of these other data indicators to understand
comprehensively the scope of the MA problem
in the United States, caution should continue
to be taken when interpreting or making in-
ferences from the data, particularly given the
variations in the way data are collected and re-
ported by various data systems and agencies.
Overall, multiple data sources should be con-
sidered when attempting to understand the na-
ture and scope of a drug problem (95), as well
as to inform the focus and development of pre-
vention and treatment efforts.
Despite recent trends, MA still remains a
major public health problem in the United
States (15). In addition, a growing area of
concern has been the increasing trends of MA
use globally. Epidemiological data from several
countries, including regions of Southeast and
East Asia (i.e., Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia,
Malaysia, and the Philippines), Canada,
Australia, South Africa (i.e., Cape Town),
and parts of Europe (e.g., Czech and Slovak
republics) indicate that MA production, traf-
ficking, and use are steadily increasing (14, 28,
58). Given the continuing, though somewhat
stabilizing, use of MA in the United States and
the growing trends in use internationally, MA
use remains a primary focus of current drug
policy and treatment efforts both domestically
and internationally (66).
HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF
THE MA PROBLEM IN THE
UNITED STATES
The accessibility and availability of the in-
gredients used in MA production have been
major contributors to the MA problem in
the United States because MA is manufac-
tured using readily available retail products
(e.g., pseudoephedrine, hydrochloric acid, red
www.annualreviews.org · The U.S. Methamphetamine Problem 387
phosphorus, ether, etc.), and numerous recipes
on how to produce MA are widely available on
the Internet (27). Although there are increasing
reports of the growing misuse of pharmaceuti-
cal amphetamines (methylphenidate, Adderall,
and Concerta) (51, 57) particularly among col-
lege students, the vast majority of amphetamine
that is abused illicitly is manufactured MA.
The MA problem has evolved over time.
Use of amphetamine-type stimulants (ATSs),
including MA, in the United States predates
World War II. Amphetamine tablets were ex-
tensively used by soldiers on all sides of the con-
flict during World War II to reduce fatigue and
suppress appetite (1). During the late 1960s, an
era of extensive drug experimentation, use of
ATS pills became problematic among young
adults, especially college students. Increased
rates of amphetamine injection brought with it
serious medical and psychiatric consequences,
prompting the drug prevention slogan, "Speed
kills." The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Pre-
vention and Control Act of 1970 sharply lim-
ited the accepted medical uses for prescribed
amphetamines, which served to reduce greatly
the ATS problem in the United States during
the 1970s. By the late 1970s, use of ATSs was
limited to a few circumscribed geographic areas
in California and Oregon, where MA continued
to be manufactured illicitly, mostly by motor-
cycle gangs. Their practice of carrying MA in
the crankcases of their motorcycles led to the
slang term "crank" for MA.
Increased problems associated with MA
resurfaced in the 1980s as motorcycle gangs
began to produce much larger amounts and
expand their customer base in Southern
California and Oregon. Through the 1980s,
MA use was fairly limited to Caucasian men,
many of whom were truck drivers, construction
workers, and other blue-collar workers. The
typical route of administration was intranasal.
During this same period, MA use in Hawaii be-
gan to increase dramatically, particularly on the
island of Oahu, as a new form of MA called
Ice began to be imported into the state from
the Philippines and Southeast Asia. This crys-
tallized form of MA was heated and inhaled as
a vapor, and as users discovered the increased
intensity of euphoria produced by the smoked
drug, smoking became the dominant route of
administration for MA in Hawaii and subse-
quently throughout the United States.
During the 1990s, the manufacture and
distribution of MA expanded in two major
ways. MA cooking in mom-and-pop home
laboratories became widespread throughout
California and other West Coast states, as
well as in Oklahoma, Missouri, and the Rocky
Mountain states. Because these labs are eas-
ily detectable by the strong odor produced in
MA production, the expansion of MA produc-
tion and use became concentrated in rural ar-
eas where labs were less detectable. At the same
time, large laboratories, called superlabs, that
produced much larger quantities of MA de-
veloped in Southern California and Northern
Mexico. MA from these labs was distributed by
Mexican drug trafficking groups to key distri-
bution points in the West and Midwest, includ-
ing Salt Lake City, Oklahoma City, and Des
Moines. The expansion of the MA supply by
these two sources resulted in the availability of
massive quantities of MA throughout the West
and Midwest at very low prices.
In 2004, many state governments began to
pass laws restricting the sale of the primary
MA precursor, pseudoephedrine, to reduce the
domestic production of MA and prevent the
ongoing spread across populations and com-
munities. The purchase of over-the-counter
cold and sinus preparations containing pseu-
doephedrine became limited in a number of
ways. In most states, the number of packages
of these medications that could be purchased
at one time was restricted, some states took the
medications completely off the open counter
and put them behind the counter, and other
states required purchasers to show identifica-
tion and sign for their pseudoephedrine prod-
ucts. In 2005, the federal government passed
the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act,
which placed federal regulations on the sale of
products containing pseudoephedrine and fur-
ther reduced its availability for use in MA man-
ufacture. These precursor control efforts have
388 Gonzales
·Mooney
·Rawson
significantly decreased the availability of MA in
many parts of the United States and have re-
sulted in dramatic increases in the street price
of the drug (56).
As inexpensive MA availability increased
through the western half of the United States,
the demographic profile of MA users expanded
to include Latinos, Asian/Pacific Islanders,
Native Americans, gay and bisexual men, of-
fender populations, women, and adolescents (6,
12, 20, 26, 78, 80, 90). In addition, the in-
creased availability of MA became apparent in
the Southeastern United States after 2000, and
by 2005, high rates of MA use were reported in
almost all parts of the United States, except for
the Northeastern corridor.
KEY TRENDS: POPULATIONS
DISPROPORTIONATELY AT
RISK FOR MA USE
Men Who Have Sex with Men
Elevated rates of MA use have been reported in
many men who have sex with men (MSM) com-
munities throughout the United States, with
associations to high-risk sexual behaviors that
increase the transmission of communicable
diseases, including increased numbers of ca-
sual and anonymous sexual partners, decreased
condom use, sex trading, group sex, more fre-
quent and longer sexual episodes, and anal in-
tercourse (21, 29, 72, 91). The relationship
between MSM, MA use, and infectious disease
infection is a significant public health issue in
the United States because MSM populations
are the only behavioral risk group experienc-
ing an increase in the incidence of HIV and
other sexually transmitted infections (91). HIV
incidence in MSM averages 1.6% per year and
differs geographically (9, 89). Incidence rates of
HIV are tripled for MSM who use MA com-
pared with nondrug-using MSM (8). Within
this group, MA use is also associated with el-
evated levels of sexually transmitted infections,
such as syphilis (4%) (109). A recent report by
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention on the connection between MA use,
high-risk sexual behavior, and infectious dis-
ease transmission in MSM communities sug-
gests that this combination of factors poses a
major threat of a renewed increase in rates of
HIV infection among MSM (10). Furthermore,
risk of HIV infection is exacerbated among MA
users with a history of infection with other sexu-
ally transmitted infections, such as genital gon-
orrhea, genital herpes, and hepatitis B (88).
Women
Unlike many other illegal drugs, MA is a drug
that appeals equally to men and women. Among
treatment samples of MA users, data indicate
that nearly as many women enter treatment
for MA dependency as men (6, 38, 79), and
female youth are more likely to use MA than
their male youth counterparts (26, 78). Un-
like men, women tend to report that their
initial MA use stemmed from the desire to
lose weight or to cope with depression. MA
use by pregnant women can jeopardize the
health of their unborn children (108). One
study found that pregnant MA-using women
had a 3.5-times greater likelihood of hav-
ing a lower-birth-weight child and preterm
births than did non-MA-using pregnant women
(93).
MA-using women are more likely to report
previous exposures to trauma, including phys-
ical and sexual abuse (61), as well as to suf-
fer from psychological distress, including mood
disorders and suicidality (22), than are MA-
using men. This is especially true for MA-using
women offenders (60). MA use also plays a ma-
jor role in domestic violence (7). MA use is
involved in almost 90% of the domestic dis-
pute cases investigated across the United States
(102). Although both men and women MA
users report increased sexual desire while un-
der the influence of MA (78), men tend to ex-
perience greater sexual enhancements and de-
sires that have been linked to more unusual
and riskier sexual acts (7). In qualitative inter-
views with MA-using women, Brown et al. (7)
found that violence and coercion tend to occur
in MA users' relationships, particularly because
www.annualreviews.org · The U.S. Methamphetamine Problem 389
MA-using males may demand riskier sexual acts
of their female partners and may be unwilling
to accept a refusal.
Criminal Offenders
MA use has been a significant problem for the
criminal justice system. MA abuse is highly as-
sociated with criminal and violent behaviors
(19) that tend to result in increased incarcer-
ations and other problems within the crimi-
nal justice system (18). In fact, the majority of
county law-enforcement agencies report that
MA is the primary drug problem among of-
fenders (49), with men and women reporting
use at fairly equal rates. This notion is further
demonstrated by the share of MA-related treat-
ment admissions referred by the criminal justice
system, which is 50% higher than admissions
for other substances of abuse (96).
HEALTH CONSEQUENCES
OF MA USE
MA is a potent stimulant with high abuse po-
tential and can be smoked, snorted, injected, or
taken orally. The desirable short-term effects
of MA, or the initial rush, are characterized by
increased energy and alertness, an elevated pos-
itive mood state, and decreased appetite (76).
Compared with other stimulants (e.g., cocaine
and nicotine), the half-life of MA is quite long,
ranging from 8 to 12 hours.
As a central nervous system stimulant, MA
facilitates the release of norepinephrine and
dopamine from nerve terminals and, to a lesser
extent, blocks their synaptic reuptake (47).
The resulting catecholamine surge mediates
many of the acute symptoms and physiological
changes associated with MA intoxication, in-
cluding elevated heart rate and blood pressure
(69). By constricting blood vessels and depriv-
ing tissues of oxygen, excess circulating nore-
pinephrine may contribute to organ damage.
Likewise, the oxidation of accumulated cate-
cholamines may lead to the formation of re-
active oxygen species and subsequent cellular
toxicity (44, 45).
Chronic MA use is associated with seri-
ous medical conditions affecting multiple or-
gan systems (64, 65, 77). Cardiovascular risks
include chest pain, arrhythmias, hypertension,
cardiomyopathy, and acute myocardial infarc-
tion, even in relatively young users (45, 99,
107). Autopsy studies have demonstrated in-
creased frequencies of accelerated coronary
artery disease and cardiac hypertrophy in MA
users relative to controls (44). Elevated rates
of electrocardiogram abnormalities, including
prolonged QTc (corrected QT) interval, have
also been documented in studies of MA users
(30, 64).
In a recent investigation of MA-related
emergency department visits (N = 353), the
most common presentations associated with
MA use were mental health problems (18.7%),
trauma (18.4%), skin infections (11.1%), and
dental pathology (9.6%) (32). Seizures and
stroke have also been reported in the context
of MA intoxication in both emergency depart-
ment and hospital settings (73, 82, 106). Other
MA-related neurological complications include
movement disorders; during intoxication, users
may exhibit hyperkinetic movements, repetitive
or stereotyped behaviors, (55, 94), or choreo-
athetoid movement disorders (52, 81).
An association between MA use and severe
dental disease, known as "meth mouth," has
been highlighted in recent literature (13, 64).
Putative mechanisms of MA-related tooth de-
cay include xerostomia (i.e., dry mouth), ex-
cessive soft-drink consumption, poor oral hy-
giene, and the acidic composition of the drug
(48). In addition, dermatologic manifestations
of MA use have been found to result from self-
inflicted injury during intoxication, infection
from repeated injection, or accidental burns
during the process of MA manufacture. MA
users may repeatedly scratch or pick at their skin
in the context of drug-induced perceptual dis-
turbances such as formication, or the sensation
of insects crawling on or underneath the skin
(3, 53).
Prior studies have demonstrated MA-
induced neurotoxicity to dopaminergic path-
ways in the brain, particularly after high doses

or chronic use (86). Investigators have observed
in MA abusers reductions in striatal dopamine
transporter activity (DAT), which may be clin-
ically associated with cognitive deficits and
slowed motor function (104). According to
recent estimates, up to 40% of MA users
exhibit global neuropsychological impairment
(83). Significant neurocognitive deficits related
to frontostriatal and limbic circuits in the
brain have been observed, including in exec-
utive functions, memory, attention, language,
psychomotor functions, and visuoconstruction
(62, 86, 92). Studies have shown that DAT ac-
tivity and cognitive functioning may partially
recover with sustained abstinence from MA
(103, 105).
In addition to physical health consequences,
MA use is associated with a range of psychi-
atric manifestations. The most common psy-
chiatric symptoms experienced by MA users
include anxiety, depression, and psychosis (23,
110), and the severity of these symptoms may
be related to the quantity and/or frequency of
MA use, the route of administration, and in-
dividual differences in sensitivity to the drug
(31). MA-induced psychotic symptoms, which
mimic those of schizophrenia, include paranoid
ideation, delusions, and auditory and visual hal-
lucinations. Psychotic symptoms occur tran-
siently in a substantial proportion of MA users
(59) and, along with other psychiatric symp-
toms, typically subside within a week of absti-
nence (69). However, in a subset of users, psy-
chosis may persist for several months or longer
after sustained abstinence (42, 100). When
intoxicated, users may become agitated or
violent (82, 110), and nearly one-third of
treatment-seeking users have reported a history
of suicide attempts (24, 110). A recent study ex-
amined differences in health-related quality of
life between a normative U.S. population and a
MA-dependent, treatment-seeking sample and
found that the MA sample reported substan-
tially lower mental health status perceptions
than did the normative U.S. population (25).
Table 1 presents a summary of health factors
associated with MA use.
SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES
ASSOCIATED WITH MA USE
MA use poses significant public health chal-
lenges to health care professionals, social
service providers, policy makers, and the law-
enforcement community. In a recent economic
assessment, MA use cost the United States
$23.4 billion in 2005 alone. This estimate in-
cluded costs associated with morbidity and
mortality, criminal justice and social welfare
services, environmental clean-up from MA
chemical production, and most significantly,
lost productivity and reduced quality of life
(71). The social harms experienced by neigh-
borhoods from systemic violence (trafficking
and dealing) and MA production are tremen-
dous. The manufacture and production of MA
require chemicals that are explosive, corrosive,
and flammable and that can result in burns,
respiratory ailments, poisoning, and fires. In
one California county, 15% of the MA labs
www.annualreviews.org · The U.S. Methamphetamine Problem 391
identified by law enforcement were found be-
cause of fires (36). Further, because manu-
facturing of MA also occurs in automobiles
(including trunks), there is an increased oppor-
tunity for distribution and spills of toxic wastes
and chemicals into the environment, which can
pollute ground water sources (36). Given the
nexus that exists between MA use and criminal
involvement (19), criminal records and jail sen-
tences result in the loss of access to social wel-
fare benefits (40) and lost quality of life, as well
as economic hardships for the offender's family
and foster care exposure for their children (34).
Furthermore, because MA use in particular
has been linked to many psychiatric difficul-
ties, such as depression, irritability, insomnia,
paranoia, and aggressive behaviors, it presents
a particularly serious risk for neglect and abuse
to the children in these environments. Accord-
ing to the Impact of Meth on Children survey
by the National Association of Counties, which
was conducted in 300 counties in 13 states,
MA is a major cause of child abuse and ne-
glect: 40% of child welfare officials reported
an increase in out-of-home placements because
of MA in 2005. Moreover, MA use results in
increased child abuse crimes (68, 74). This in-
formation is concerning because neglected and
abused children are at risk of social, emotional,
developmental, and behavioral problems dur-
ing childhood and adolescence, as well as cogni-
tive, psychological, and permanent brain dam-
age or physical impairments (16, 33), and even
death (41).
Furthermore, these young children are ex-
posed to MA, a highly psychoactive stimulant,
and the toxic precursor chemicals associated
with its production, exposures that undermine
their health and well-being (85). In almost
10,000 seizures of MA labs documented by the
Drug Enforcement Agency, over one third had
children under the age of 15 years present (85).
INTERVENTIONS FOR MA USE
Acute agitation with paranoid ideation is the
most common emergency department presen-
tation of MA intoxication. In many cases,
treatment does not require the use of medica-
tions, but rather a brief treatment intervention
or referral to specialized treatment. When med-
ications are employed, the choices are usually
between a benzodiazepine and an antipsychotic.
Traditionally, haloperidol in 5 mg parenteral
repeated doses is used, often in combination
with 1­2 mg of lorazepam and 1 mg of the
anticholinergic benztropine. Patients receiving
haloperidol alone tend to experience more ex-
trapyramidal reactions (2). It remains unclear
whether benzodiazepine or neuroleptic medi-
cations should be preferred in the treatment of
MA-induced agitation. No specific treatments
for MA psychosis have been established, and
protocols similar to those used for MA acute
intoxication described above are the most com-
monly used approaches.
Research collected over the past two decades
has demonstrated, to a large extent, that psy-
chosocial treatment for MA dependency is ef-
fective, resulting in measurable and desirable
changes in drug use and other social behaviors
compared with no treatment (77). Interventions
that have been found to be effective in empirical
tests include cognitive behavioral interventions
that focus on self-efficacy skill building and re-
lapse prevention (11, 79), contingency manage-
ment approaches that provide motivational in-
centives for demonstration of desired nondrug
use behaviors (84), stepped care for transition-
ing MA users through continued treatment lev-
els based on need (46), and drug court for MA-
dependent offenders (39, 54). To date, there are
no approved pharmacological treatments for
MA dependency (63); however, several treat-
ments show potential, including bupropion (17,
70, 87) and methylphenidate (98).
Attempts to break the cycle of drug use and
crime have included providing drug treatment
to offenders while in prison. The most common
treatment modality used in prisons is the ther-
apeutic community (TC). In California specifi-
cally, MA-using offenders are supported by the
Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act
(SACPA), also known as Proposition 36, which
was voted into law in 2000 (50). SACPA re-
quires that nonviolent adult drug offenders be

offered treatment in lieu of incarceration. Since
the law's implementation, more than 30,000 of-
fenders have received SACPA treatment each
year, the majority of whom are MA users
(101).
MA users are seen as some of the most dif-
ficult drug treatment patients, owing to pro-
tracted physiological and psychological prob-
lems caused by the drug's impact on neural
pathways. Factors related to successful treat-
ment outcomes among MA users include lower
levels of MA use at treatment admission (fewer
than 15 days of MA use out of the previous 30),
shorter histories of MA use (2 years or less), re-
tention in treatment for at least 90 days, and pe-
riods of abstinence during treatment of at least
3 consecutive weeks or greater (35, 79). Stud-
ies examining risk factors for poor treatment
outcomes among MA users have identified
continued MA use during treatment, injection
use, having less than a high-school education,
young age at treatment admission, having a
disability (4, 35), polydrug use (5), childhood
trauma and abuse (61), and having an under-
lying psychiatric disorder (22, 24). Continued
treatment participation and active recovery ef-
forts, including frequent 12-step program par-
ticipation, have been associated with successful
treatment outcomes among MA users over time
(25, 37).
IMPLICATIONS
The serious MA problem that evolved in the
United States over the past 20 years has signifi-
cantly impacted the public health, social wel-
fare, and criminal justice systems and offers
many lessons for public health policy in the
United States and other countries.
First, there needs to be an adequate epidemi-
ological assessment system in place to bring
emerging drug problems to the attention of
public health officials and policy makers. The
current U.S. epidemiological monitoring sys-
tem is not adequate to fully identify and recog-
nize emerging drug problems, as was witnessed
by the slow recognition of the seriousness of the
MA problem. MA use emerged as a small local
problem and spread exponentially from west to
east over a 20-year span without a coordinated
federal response.
Second, an effective monitoring system
should incorporate public health indicators and
data from multiple systems including criminal
justice agencies (both police departments and
correctional facilities), the educational system,
social welfare agencies, and the primary care
and mental health systems to adequately iden-
tify specific subgroups and geographical com-
munities that are impacted.
Third, a coordinated national response
should include comprehensive prevention and
treatment programming. Prevention efforts
for MA in the United States have been
sparse and regional (i.e., Montana, Kansas, and
California). Only during the past few years have
prevention efforts for MA been initiated at the
national level.
Fourth, the response to the needs of ad-
dicted individuals should be based on a public
health approach as opposed to a criminal jus-
tice approach. Tens of thousands of MA users
filled prisons in the Western and Midwestern
United States long before there was an orga-
nized and meaningful response from the public
health system.
CONCLUSION
This article has provided a critical examination
of the development of the MA problem in the
United States, including patterns and trends in
MA use and key characteristics of high-risk sub-
groups, as well as interventions that have been
used to address the problem. It is unlikely that
MA will disappear from the landscape of drug
abuse problems challenging U.S. systems at the
federal, state, and local levels. The few tar-
geted efforts aimed at reducing and/or prevent-
ing the MA problem over the past two decades
clearly demonstrate that a strategic program of
research, prevention, and treatment must be de-
veloped and continuously funded to address the
MA problem adequately.
