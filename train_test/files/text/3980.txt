Article
Although the U.S. homeless population has slightly decreased
in recent years, far too many individuals remain homeless. It
is evident that the appropriateness of the current structure of
services and modes of delivery require evaluation and modi-
fication to meet existing needs. There has been limited litera-
ture that examines the health, lifestyles, and goals of the
homeless and potential interventions, which will move indi-
viduals from homelessness to self-sufficiency and social
reintegration. Community health nurses are in a key position
to participate in interdisciplinary care models for the home-
less through awareness of health, lifestyles, and identifica-
tion of personal and vocational goals.
Literature Review
Despite the interventions provided by various social services
programs and religious and governmental organizations,
homelessness continues to be a significant issue in the United
States. While it is impossible to measure with exact certainty
the number of individuals experiencing homelessness in a
given day or year, an estimated 633,782 individuals were
reported as homeless in January, 2012 (National Alliance to
End Homelessness, 2013). From 2011 to 2012, there was a
modest decrease in homelessness of 0.4%, which is represen-
tative of approximately 2,235 people (National Alliance to
End Homelessness, 2013). The rate of homelessness was 20
homeless persons per 10,000 persons in the general popula-
tion (National Alliance to End Homelessness, 2013). The
problem has been perpetuated over the past two decades by
the lack of affordable housing and a concurrent increase in
poverty. The poverty rate increased by approximately 5%
between 2010 and 2011 with 48 million persons living in
poverty in 2011 (National Alliance to End Homelessness,
2013). The circumstances leading to homelessness are
numerous and can be classified as personal, financial, and
structural (Christiani, Hudson, Nyamathi, Mutere, & Sweat,
2008). Personal causes of homelessness include mental
health issues, addiction, physical health issues, and domestic
violence. Structural and financial causes include lack of
employment, decreased access to health care, minimum
wage jobs incapable of providing self-sufficiency, lack of
affordable housing, foreclosure, recession, medical bank-
ruptcy, and decrease in public assistance programs.
The majority of homeless are single adults with a variety
of complex medical, mental health and addiction issues. The
morbidity and mortality rates are higher for the homeless
population as compared with the general population with
cardiovascular diseases comprising the leading cause of
death (Randers et al., 2012).
In many instances, the homeless population exists from
day to day lacking a plan or sense of direction for the future.
Many of the services currently in existence to serve the
homeless aggregate support a day to day existence by pro-
viding meals and shelter but lack educational, vocational,

Lifestyles and Goals of Homeless Male
Shelter Users
Kelly A. Schwend1, Maureen Cluskey1, and Michael Cordell1
Abstract
The purpose of this study was to assess the health, lifestyles, and goals of homeless male shelter users. The mixed-methods
descriptive non-experimental study was conducted at a homeless shelter cot program. The Dykeman biopsychosocial
interventional model was used as a framework for this study. Thirty men utilizing the program were interviewed using the
Chapin Lifestyle Assessment Survey. In addition, the men were asked about their social support system and goals. The results
demonstrated that the group had a strong sense of responsibility for their own actions, a desire to learn, and were motivated
to make a meaningful contribution. Goals focused on obtaining employment and securing housing. Shelter staff was reported
as a source of social support.

and case management components that facilitate reintegra-
tion into society and move individuals to self-sufficiency.
Providing for basic necessities and safety is of paramount
importance but is only the first step in the process of provid-
ing holistic care to the homeless population. Most of the
homeless seeking assistance focus on meeting immediate
needs for food and shelter and do not address the issues that
have led to homelessness (O'Toole et al., 2007). To provide
holistic care to the homeless, it is imperative that surround-
ing social and personal issues be addressed (Tsai, Mares, &
Rosenheck, 2012; Williams & Stickley, 2011). Homeless
individuals often experience social isolation and stigmatiza-
tion. Possessing an affiliation with a group or organization
provides the individuals a sense of societal belonging,
thereby facilitating social reintegration (Tsai et al., 2012).
Homeless adults may better benefit from a model of long-
term management rather than crisis management of food and
shelter (Kim, Ford, Howard, & Bradford, 2010). Supportive
housing alone does not affect societal reintegration of home-
less adults. Providing choice and a sense of control over
one's living environment may slightly affect psychological
well-being and satisfaction with housing in this population
(Tsai & Rosenheck, 2012b).
To move individuals from poverty, addiction, chronic dis-
ease, and homelessness to self-sufficiency and reintegration
into society, the provision of structured, goal-oriented pro-
gramming is essential. One such biopsychosocial interven-
tional model is multidimensional and is designed to meet the
complex and holistic needs of the homeless population
(Dykeman, 2011). The model includes four components. The
first component is initial interface with the homeless client
where basic physical and safety needs are assessed and
addressed. The second phase focuses on mental health status
and cognitive capabilities as well as the as the ability to
access community resources. This adaptive functional
assessment describes the client's skill set for coping with
various social and environmental demands such as relation-
ships, school, and work. The need for referrals and associ-
ated case management is often identified. The third
intervention phase focuses on psychological counseling to
address lifestyle issues surrounding work and social demands
as well as self-concept and spirituality. The fourth phase of
the intervention addresses client advocacy. This is accom-
plished when working on a one on one basis with clients and
also when assisting them as they negotiate local, regional,
and federal resources. This type of supportive housing and
comprehensive case management provides the much-needed
resources beyond the basics of meals and shelter to assure
that the personal, social, and environmental issues leading to
homelessness are addressed.
While there is an abundance of literature describing the
challenges and experiences of the homeless in terms of physi-
cal, mental, and social challenges, few studies examine the
perspectives of the homeless population in terms of health,
lifestyle, and goals. To effectively care for the homeless
population, it is imperative that health care professionals
possess insight into and awareness in these areas. Ideally, the
function of shelters should be to provide temporary crisis or
transitional residence in conjunction with active and ongoing
collaboration with the homeless population on goal-directed
educational and vocational training, which facilitates self-
sufficiency instead of merely providing for basic necessities.
Supporting housing models need to focus on social reinte-
gration and improvement of clients' life satisfaction (Tsai
et al., 2012; Tsai & Rosenheck, 2012a). Community health
nurses are in a key position to participate in interdisciplinary
teams and provide expertise in case management, wellness,
health promotion, and maintenance.
Method
To further expand the body of knowledge related to the
health, lifestyles, and goals of homeless men, a study was
conducted at a homeless shelter with an overnight cot pro-
gram for homeless men in a Midwestern city. The study was
a mixed-methods design of descriptive statistical analysis
and naturalistic inquiry using qualitative data (Patton, 1990).
Homelessness was theoretically defined as "an individual or
family living in a supervised publically or privately operated
shelter designated to provide temporary living arrange-
ments"(U.S.DepartmentofHousingandUrbanDevelopment
[HUD] Homeless Emergency and Rapid Transition to
Housing Act, 2011, p. 75995). Operationally, homeless was
defined as residents sleeping in the local shelter cot program.
The Lifestyle Assessment Survey (Chapin & Ivey, 2004) was
used to measure health and lifestyles. Open-ended interview
questions inquired into events leading to homelessness, long-
and short-term personal goals, and social support. Interviews
were conducted by a male registered nurse research assistant.
This nurse was chosen due to his prior relationship with the
men and their comfort with the nurse.
Sample and Procedure
There was an average of 40 to 50 men sleeping at the shelter
nightly. A convenience sample of 30 homeless men was
interviewed. All men sleeping at the shelter were above the
age of 18 years. Participants were solicited during the morn-
ing breakfast. Those choosing to participate received two bus
passes and a bottle of water as an incentive for participation.
After an individual introduction to the study by the inter-
viewer, informed consent was understood if the individual
verbally chose to proceed with the interview. The study was
approved by the agency and the university institutional
review board.
Instrumentation
Participants were interviewed using the LifestyleAssessment
Survey (Chapin & Ivey, 2004). The survey consisted of 60
Schwend et al. 3
questions on a 5-point Likert-type scale. There were six sub-
scales dividing lifestyle into Physical Health, Emotional
Well-Being,IntellectualEnrichment,Life­WorkSatisfaction,
Social Effectiveness, and Spiritual Awareness. Each subscale
consisted of 10 statements reflective of a positive lifestyle.
Participants were asked to rate their lifestyle behaviors with
a maximum score of 50 in each subscale. Possible total
scores range from 60 to 300 with higher scores indicating
more positive lifestyle behaviors and lower scores
indicating less positive lifestyle behaviors and a need for
improvement.
In addition, participants were interviewed regarding their
social support system, events leading to homelessness, and
their personal goals for the week, month, and year.
Demographic variables included age, number of years home-
less, and level of education. The interview format was cho-
sen due to a potential lack of reading ability and to assure
comprehension of the survey items, and to allow for open-
ended questions that encourage free responses. Participants
were able to seek clarification regarding statements. Each
interview took place in a private setting located in the shelter
and lasted approximately 30 min.
Results
The results of the study found the average age of homeless
men to be 45 years with ranges of 24 to 69 years. Eighty-six
percent completed high school or additional education. The
majority of men were found to be on the street 1 to 5 years
with outliers ranging from 10 to 44 years.
The mean score for the participants on the Lifestyles
Assessment Survey (Chapin & Ivey, 2004) was 188 with
scores ranging from 133 to 244 of a possible 300. Overall,
this score indicated the group as "having the right idea but
more work is needed" according to the Lifestyle Assessment
Survey. Internal consistency of items on survey was demon-
strated with a Cronbach's alpha of .917. Survey item means
indicate areas that lend opportunity for programming and
lifestyle improvement. Individual questions were reviewed,
and 7 mean scores were at or above 4.0/5.0. Three individ-
ual questions had mean scores of 2.0/5.0 or less. See
Table 1.
The mean total score of the Lifestyle Assessment Survey
was compared for the men who reported being homeless for
less than 2 years with the total score of those reporting being
homeless for 2 years or more. It was hypothesized that those
being homeless for a longer time would report a less healthy
lifestyle. There was no significant difference between the
mean total scores of the two groups, t(28) = 1.008, p> .05.
For the analysis of the open-ended questions, a cross-case
analysis was done individually by three researchers to
describe the data. Each question was reviewed, and items
were grouped by topic and color coded. Subsequently,
researchers gathered to compare grouped items and discuss
the interpretation of the data.
There were a variety of responses to the question associ-
ated with events leading to homelessness. The responses
were grouped into four categories: relationships, economic,
substance abuse, and health. Relationship responses were
related to loss; many had divorced or lost a parent who had
been providing a home. Economic responses were related to
job loss, money mismanagement, and child support. The loss
of a driver's license also affected ability to find employment.
Many study participants were forthright with responses
related to substance abuse. Alcoholism, drug abuse, and mul-
tiple DUIs (driving under the influence) were reported as
events leading to homelessness. In addition, substance-
abuse-related health issues including depression, multiple
surgeries, and a bleeding disorder were reported as factors
leading to homelessness.
All of the study participants had personal goals. Short-
term goals focused on employment, whereas long-term goals
were related to housing. The immediate or weekly goals
were related to getting sober, being healthy, and finding a
job. Monthly goals included finding a home, while goals for
the year were staying sober, getting a job, finding a home,
and finding transportation.
Friendship and emotional support were reported from
many men. Most participants reported having family and
friends. Some singled out parents and siblings. In addition,
the shelter staff was reported to be a source of social
support.
Limitations
A significant limitation of the study was the lack of a com-
parison group for the assessment tool. Specific metrics were
not available from the author. In addition, the tool may have
not been the most appropriate to utilize with this population.
It is possible the tool did not capture data specific to this
population, particularly information regarding physical
health and health promotion behaviors. Finally, the sample
size was small, and interviews were conducted by one inter-
viewer at one homeless shelter with an exclusive male popu-
lation. Therefore, results may not be generalizable.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to assess the health, lifestyles,
and goals of homeless male shelter users. The literature
describing these concepts in the homeless population is lim-
ited. The findings of this study suggest that this sample of
homeless men have a broad range of lifestyle behaviors and
personal goals. Many of the study participants, like many
homeless, have made poor lifestyle choices related to sub-
stance abuse, which in turn, resulted in their homelessness.
The mean of the total score on the Lifestyle Assessment
Survey demonstrates this population is in need of assistance
to increase healthy lifestyle choices, health promotion, and
health maintenance behaviors. To best address the broad
4 SAGE Open
range of needs of this population, an interdisciplinary
approach utilizing a biopsychosocial model (Dykeman,
2011) is essential. Services for the homeless population must
provide interdisciplinary interventions including supportive
housing, which facilitates social reintegration, assistance
with obtaining employment or vocational training, and the
provision of comprehensive health care services.
In the Dykeman (2011) model, physical and safety needs
are initially assessed. Although basic safety needs are being
addressed in the shelter cot program, physical and health
promotion parameters were demonstrated as lacking. Mean
scores on the Physical Health subscale were the lowest of all
subscales (26.0/50.0). Although participants reported daily
aerobic exercise, it can be assumed this is related to walking
around town as they have no permanent housing or shelter at
this emergency facility. More structured exercise programs
could benefit these men. To address the issue of physical fit-
ness, community health nurses must be innovative in their
approach and encourage aerobic activities in ways the home-
less population can easily access and participate. Street soc-
cer is one such activity that has demonstrated success
(Randers et al., 2012). Incentivizing organized exercise or
walking programs may increase daily aerobic activity. Other
item means in the Physical Health subscale were very low.

This group of homeless men did not report avoidance of
tobacco or other dangerous drugs. The community health
nurse might refer or design programs in smoking cessation
and/or partner with Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or
Narcotics Anonymous (NA). Additional health measures of
diet, health exams, substance abuse, rest, and relaxation are
not typically under the control of the homeless. Therefore,
the Physical Health subscale may not have been ideal to
accurately assess physical health parameters in the homeless
population.
The Lifestyle Assessment Survey subscale on Emotional
Well-Being mean was 32.0/50.0. This score reflects a sense
of responsibility for one's actions, an acceptance of self and
life circumstances, possessing a sense of humor, and deriv-
ing enjoyment from life. It is both troubling and noteworthy
that the lowest subscale item mean ascertaining whether the
individual felt loved was 2.1/5.0. Overall, despite being
homeless, the resiliency of the human spirit prevailed, and
individuals reported a relatively high degree of emotional
well-being and acceptance of their life station.
The Lifestyle Assessment Survey subscale on Intellectual
Enrichment was the second lowest mean (30.0/50.0) of the
six subscales. Although participants reported they enjoyed
learning new information, the opportunities to express cre-
ativity, enjoy a variety of entertainment, and acquire and
share new information are limited in a shelter setting. Nurses
in collaboration with community agencies can provide pro-
graming on a variety of health topics, entertainment, creative
art and music classes, and speakers with discussion on cur-
rent world events.
The Lifestyle Assessment subscale on Life­Work
Satisfaction mean (35.1/50.0) was the highest of the six sub-
scales. Participants reported being motivated to make a
meaningful contribution, were willing to accept new or extra
responsibilities, and were receptive to feedback regarding
their life work. The mean for an item in the subscale related
to the balance between life work and leisure was particularly
low (2.8/5.0). This is most likely reflective of the survival
mode reality in which homeless individuals exist. Shelter
program directors are in a position to facilitate partnerships
with agencies and community colleges for skills training and
job placement.
The Lifestyle Assessment Survey subscale mean on
Social Effectiveness was 33.2/50.0. The low mean on the
subscale item related to involvement in the local community
(2.0/5.0) is likely reflective of the social isolation a marginal-
ized group experiences. The highest mean for an item on the
subscale was related to acceptance of others of a different
race, gender, or faith (4.1/5.0). Although shelter residents
may not feel part of the local community, a sense of belong-
ing and a culture of friendship exist. The men enjoy camara-
derie with fellow residents. Shelter staff were frequently
reported to be a source of social support and identified as
family.
The Lifestyle Assessment Survey subscale mean for
Spiritual Awareness was 31.4/50.0. Item means for respect-
ing the beliefs of others (3.8/5.0) and acting to help and care
for others (3.7/5.0) were the highest. This is also supported
by the reported sense of community in the interviews related
to social support. Similarly, Tsai and Rosenheck (2011) con-
cluded that assessing and promoting spirituality may benefit
homeless populations in both clinical and psychological
outcomes.
A hallmark finding in this study was the lack of feelings
of esteem from others, as participants had to contemplate
whether or not they felt loved. Dykeman's (2011) third inter-
vention phase recommends a focus on counseling surround-
ing work, social demands, and spirituality. Health
professionals at this shelter need to be aware that shelter per-
sonnel may be identified as "family" and, therefore, are an
important source of social support. Therapeutic relationships
and professional boundaries must be negotiated by nurses
and social services personnel while being viewed by home-
less clients as supportive and caring. Finally, persons who
were previously homeless identified that a critical compo-
nent of moving off of the streets was someone reaching out
to them (MacKnee & Mervyn, 2002). It is important that
community health nurses and other health professionals
interfacing with this population validate and promote these
attributes, as this will facilitate the process of goal setting
and attainment necessary to move from homelessness to
self-sufficiency.
In the Dykeman (2011) model, the second intervention
phase addresses cognitive capabilities and mental health sta-
tus. It is noteworthy that 86% of the sample reported gradu-
ating from high school. This level of educational attainment
suggests a strong potential for success with vocational train-
ing. Future services directed toward this population should
focus on educational and vocational programs that chal-
lenge and encourage these men to succeed. Goals should be
directed toward attaining and maintaining sobriety, obtain-
ing appropriate housing, and securing employment.
Community health nurses must partner with addiction
recovery specialists and social services personnel to facili-
tate optimal outcomes for this population. Transitioning
from homelessness into a community residence is a tremen-
dous undertaking because of the complex psychosocial
issues inherent in the homeless population. Homeless per-
sons will require more assistance and support while navigat-
ing the social service system after obtaining housing, as
obtaining housing alone is not sufficient. On obtaining
housing, continued and long-term additional assistance in
the form of supportive housing and active case management
is necessary to improve outcomes. Ongoing social support
can facilitate improvement in physical and mental health
outcomes (Stein, Nyamathi, & Zane, 2009). Continued
monitoring and support will facilitate a successful transition
(Drury, 2008).
6 SAGE Open
Community health nurses possess the knowledge, atti-
tude, and skills to lead and take the initiative in the develop-
ment of a tool to more accurately assess the health and
lifestyles of the homeless. Traditional tools may not accu-
rately assess physical health and health promotion behaviors.
Further study, which includes a modified assessment of those
parameters, is warranted. Interventions must be tailored to
meet the unique and individual needs of this population.
Finally, community health nurses must assume a leadership
role and advocate for changes in public policy and streamlin-
ing of services, which facilitate the process of social reinte-
gration (Daiski, 2007; Dykeman, 2011).
