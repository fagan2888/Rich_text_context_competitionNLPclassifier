Introduction
Gender relates to a set of cultural expectations according to
which men and women behave (Kruger, 1997). Each cul-
ture assigns certain roles and standardized patterns of
behavior to its members that allow them to organize their
lives in a consistent and predictable way. In normative
order, cultures and societies prescribe normative role
behavior and ease-down interaction of individuals (Lindsey,
2010). Normative role behavior is collectivistic that delim-
its individual freedom and tie them to predetermined rights
and duties as well as expectations. The socially constructed
and culturally defined realities are closely associated with
the development of stereotypes that are predetermined
notions or images, which define various spheres of activi-
ties including gender.
Stereotyping is the act of judging someone on the basis
of one's perception of the group to which that person
belongs. In other words, it is "the unconscious or conscious
application of (accurate or inaccurate) knowledge of a
group in judging a member of the group" (Agars, 2004,
p. 104). A stereotype is a view that is held by one or more
individuals about a group to make overgeneralization of the
characteristics of that group (Bell, 2007). Through stereo-
typing, people are categorized according to the characteris-
tics they have in common, including gender, age, race,
ethnicity, language, religion, and so on. In sociological dis-
course, stereotyping is closely associated with prejudicial
judgment characterized by rigid and irrational generaliza-
tion about an entire community of people. More specifi-
cally, gender stereotypes are deep-rooted perceptions of the

Abstract
Gender stereotyping and gender role development is one of the debatable concerns to sociologists especially those who
are interested in sociology of gender. This study attempts to investigate the role of family inculcating gender stereotyping
in Pakhtun culture and its impact on gender role development conducted in public-sector universities of Malakand Division,
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The data were collected through in-depth interview method using interview guide
as a tool of data collection. A sample size of 24 respondents consisting male and female students and teachers (8 samples from
each university through purposive sampling technique) was selected from three universities in the region, that is, University
of Malakand, University of Swat, and Shaheed Benazir Bhutto University Sharingal (main campus). The collected information
has been analyzed qualitatively where primary information has been linked with secondary data for further elaboration
and attainment of grounded facts. The study reveals that gender stereotyping and gender role formation are sociocultural
and relational constructs, which are developed and inculcated in the institutional network, social interaction, and social
relationships especially in family. The study indicated that in family sphere, gender stereotyping and gender role formation are
the outcome of gender socialization, differential familial environment, and parents' differential role with children. The study
recommends that gender-balanced familial environment, adopting the strategy of gender mainstreaming and positive role of
media, can overcome gender stereotyping and reduce its impacts on gender and social role formation.

characteristics of male and female, which support the con-
tinuity of specific gender roles (Suter, 2006).
Based on gendered division of labor and social roles, men
and women are often represented stereotypically according
to the traits they are assumed to possess by virtue of their
biological makeup (Lindsey, 2010). Several studies point to
stereotyping on the basis of their sex-related characteristics
(Sanders & Peterson, 1999). It is viewed that gender stereo-
types are formed during the process of learning and commu-
nication in which sociocultural and interactional factors play
the role of key socializing agents (Leaper & Friedman,
2007). The factors and agents also include family as a basic
and primary source of gender socialization (J. E. Jacobs,
1991) where social roles are assigned based on gender
(Eccles, 1983; J. Jacobs, 2000). Family as a foremost social-
izing agency transmits simplistic labels and deep-rooted
messages considered specific for a feminine woman and a
masculine man. In family, different role models are assigned
to women and men according to what is traditionally attrib-
uted to each sex. Similarly, on the basis of a set of physical
qualities and psychological characteristics defined by family,
society labels tasks which are known as gender stereotypes.
In many societies, masculinity is identified with competi-
tiveness, aggressiveness, and independence, whereas femi-
nine stereotypes revolve around a set of beliefs that define
women as caring, altruistic, affective in interpersonal rela-
tionships, child friendly, emotionally expressive, sensitive
and empathetic, and above all submissive and passive
(Ridgeway & Balkwell, 1997). Based on the argument, this
study then attempts to investigate the role of family institu-
tion in nurturing gender stereotypes among Pakhtuns. The
study mainly focuses on the role of family in preserving,
reinforcing, and thus perpetuating gender differentiation,
gender socialization, gendered division of labor, and parents'
differential treatment that inculcate gender stereotypes and
resultantly affect gender role development.
Statement of the Problem
As a male-dominated patriarchal society, Pakhtuns1 segre-
gate gender roles according to the social order. Along with
sex differences in perceived qualities, a socially shared and
culturally defined set of expectations about gender behavior
exists according to which individuals behave (Javaid, Omer,
& Jabeen, 2012). Dichotomous stereotypical images regard-
ing gender roles are common, and role development is less
natural and more sociocultural based on predetermined
notions. Masculine roles are instrumental that link family to
the external world, whereas females manage domestic activi-
ties. The projection of sexism in the traditional and patriar-
chic familial environment of Pakhtuns plays a substantial
role in providing a conducive environment to stereotypical
dichotomy.
The development of gender stereotyping is not haphazard
or automatic, rather facilitated by various sociocultural and
relational factors. The foremost among them is family, which
plays a significant role in the development of gender stereo-
types, and because of physical and social proximity, social-
ization, raring, and caring, the role of women is often
stereotyped (Lindsey, 2010). In Pakhtun society, family
institution operates under the influence of patriarchy2 along
with customs and traditions manifested in awarding more
space to men. For instance, the birth of male child is sym-
bolic of increased family power and is thus celebrated,
whereas female birth does not bring such celebrations (Naz
& Rehman, 2012). Similarly, key decisions related to mar-
riage, mate selection, and other familial issues are dominated
by men. The normative social order restricts women and
tends to favor men to become the guardians and the rulers.
Patriarchy protects male ideology and nurtures negative gen-
der values. This study then is an attempt to investigate famil-
ial factors that contribute to stereotyping and highlights
institutional mechanism for reinforcing and preserving gen-
der stereotypes among Pakhtuns. It also attempts to explore
the impact of stereotyping on gender role development.
Method
This research study is qualitative in nature based on both sec-
ondary and primary information. For secondary information,
a thorough review of literature has been carried out where
gender stereotypes are highlighted in a thematic manner. The
primary data are gathered from students and teachers of pub-
lic-sector universities of Malakand Division.
To enrich the findings of the study, the primary data also
include in-depth interviews through interview guide. A total
of 24 interviews were conducted in the three universities, 8
from each including University of Malakand, University of
Swat, and Shaheed Benazir Bhutto University, Sharingal.
Selected through purposive sampling, a gender-balanced rep-
resentation from each university was ensured, that is, 2 male
students, 2 male teachers, 2 female students, and 2 female
teachers.3 Besides, the collected information related to the
study has been analyzed qualitatively where primary infor-
mation has been linked with secondary data for further elabo-
ration and attainment of grounded facts.
Areas of Analysis Based on Primary and
Secondary Data
Gender Socialization and Gender Stereotyping
Socialization is the process through which a child becomes
an individual respecting his or her environment's laws,
norms, and customs. Gender socialization is a more focused
form of socialization; it is how children of different sexes are
socialized into their respective gender roles (Giddens, 1993)
and taught what it means to be male or female (Morris,
1988). Gender socialization begins at the moment of birth,
and from the time when people ask one and the simple
Hussain et al. 3
question, is it a girl or a boy (Gleitman, Fridlund, & Reisberg,
2000, p. 499)? Similarly, gender and gender role formation
are primarily learned through the dominant agencies of
socialization, such as family, peer, school, and so on, which
are considered "teachers" of the society.
Through socialization, one can learn what is appropriate
and improper for both genders (Crespi, 2004). To sociolo-
gists, socialization is a process through which individuals
learn the way of life that includes culture and other capabili-
ties acquired by humans as members of the society (Booysen
& De Witt, 1995; Haralambos, 1985; Lindsey, 1997;
Popenoe, Cunningham, & Boult, 1998). Moreover, it is a
lifelong process where individuals are believed to accumu-
late knowledge of the rules and regulations, norms and val-
ues, attitudes, customs, and other role requirements that are
acceptable to their society and culture (Haralambos, 1985).
In this connection, every society presents a prescription
regarding the content that individual members have to con-
form to, to become active members of the society. Similarly,
through socialization, individuals are inducted to social
world to learn gender appropriate role.
In this regard, gender role is learned through the process
of socialization where individuals learn behaviors and atti-
tudes prescribed by the society. Through this process, a par-
ticular culture and society shapes and reshapes the type and
kind of men and women they like them to be (Hensline,
1996). Similarly, each and every society of the world pre-
scribes particular behaviors and attitudes for men and women
appropriate in different situations, which constitute gender
norms in the form of prescriptive guidelines and resultantly
form gender roles (Doyle & Paludi, 1991). With regard to
gender role development, social learning perspective links it
with a lifelong learning process, which is carried by social-
ization through social institutions such as family, peers,
media, and religion. Furthermore, it is carried out through
observation, imitation, and reinforcement mechanism that
provide a ground for character building and role formation
(Lynn, 1996).
In familial environment, people learn specific sets of gen-
der role requirements and responsibilities in accordance to
their relevant social statuses. In addition, people also learn to
recognize the pressure of external forces that compel them to
conform to, even when they do not accept the role definitions
others have for them. Children learn the traditional gender
roles where such roles help to sustain gender stereotypes, for
example, males are believed to be aggressive, independent,
and task-oriented, whereas females are assumed as more sen-
sitive, emotional, people-oriented, and dependent. In this
regard, extracts have been taken from field information as
evidence material to the secondary data mentioned. The field
data reflect different views of the interviewees that come in
support to the secondary data, while somehow it has con-
founded the literature. The question regarding socialization
was asked as follows: "When and how did you start knowing
gender stereotyping?"
In response to the questions, different opinions and
responses were recorded having unanimity and disagreement
at some points. In this regard, majority of the respondents
reflected that knowing the stereotyping usually starts at the
early childhood. In such type of situations, children face a
kind of taunt and social stigma while indulging in tasks of
opposite gender, that is, playing Gudyani (Dolls), Chindro,
Mirgaaty,4 and so on, as such games are viewed as feminine.
Among the respondents, extractions have been taken from
the interview of Respondent 13 (male student) where he
expresses,
. . . I used to play the traditional games at the early childhood
without observing the masculine or feminine games. I had my
female cousins who were my ultimate friends and we had to play
games such as Gudyaani (Dolls), Chindro, Mirgaaty, etc. In
most of the cases, my father observed me and daunted me
severely for playing such type of womanly games. I was
discouraged to mix-up with females as it was against the cultural
patterns and traditions of the family as well as community.
This sort of compulsion over children creates a sense and
identity of their gender where they are directed through ste-
reotypic socialization that male children should not join the
company and games related to females, and females should
avoid masculine activities. Besides, in response to the next
question that when and where do gender stereotypes form,
the respondents reflected in majority that mostly gender seg-
regation occurs at the early puberty or teenage. It was added
by the respondents that the gender segregation occurs at the
time when two opposite sexes, that is, boys and girls, come
in contact or gather with one another, which is mostly forbid-
den by the family and community. In this connection, the
communal perception is highly taken into consideration.
Respondent 9 (male student) tells,
. . . Since the very early age, I used to visit the traditional Mela
(mostly celebrated at Eids) in my village along with other
members of the family especially the female relatives. In this
way, I confronted a strong and strict communal rejection for
doing so when few of community members complained my
father after our visit. My father severely scolded me and even
slapped me many times that it was a bad job I had involved in.
At the same time (while meeting the consequences) I realized
that male and female are the two different streams that are not
allowed to be mixed up. Since that, I hear the resilience of those
slaps and avoid the mixing up with opposite gender as it is a kind
of sin.
Resultantly, the discussion so far in terms of literary and
empirical information reflects that socialization is mostly cul-
tural in nature, which is inculcated to the followers inside fam-
ily and community. Cultural transmission and inculcation is an
ancestral process that is reinforced through imitation and mod-
eling of the socializing agencies, particularly parents inside
the family. In the same manner, the new generation in the area
4 SAGE Open
under study has been acknowledged with gender-specific roles
since their birth that continues throughout their life span. In
this regard, the concluding field information leads to a smaller
theory that differential gender socialization and compulsive
familial environment create gender differences that become
gender stereotypic and finally develop gender role.
Differences Between Boys and Girls and Gender
Stereotyping
Gender differences are developed through the process of
socialization where such differences are strengthened during
childhood as well as adolescence. For example, before the
age of 3 years, there are fascinating differences between boys
and girls that further create differences in their interaction. In
this way, boys mostly attempt to dominate, control, and try to
find out the answer of the question "Am I better than you?"
and they try to present themselves as being strong and inde-
pendent. Similarly, they also establish their dominant social
status; even then, they try to continue and use the masculine
autonomy to maintain their position in the long run.
Contrary to boys, girls try to establish and sustain their
relationships where they often ask the question, "Do you like
me?" because boys and girls want to adopt and do different
things; they start to avoid each other at the age of 3 or 4
years. At the age of 6 years, girls mostly do not like the rough
and tough male-type play and dislike boys' dominance, and
therefore, they choose the girls as playmates instead of boys.
In childhood, boys mostly do not like girls' games. Indeed,
boys are not ready to adopt feminine characters and even feel
shame to do so, whereas this is not the case with girls. In this
way, boys always want to be active and competitive, and
seem less interested to win friends and make relationships
(Basow, 1992).
The facts in terms of gender differences have prevalence
in the area under study as well, although this research has
identified some other areas that are missing in the prevalent
literature such as gender differences in games, domestic
activities, peers' participation, and so on. In this regard, the
questions asked in terms of gender differences were as fol-
lows: What are gender differences, and are they different or
stereotyped? And, how do biological characteristics deter-
mine and influence gender role?
To examine the difference in light of primary data, the
respondents were interviewed where their response has been
accounted and explained. The gender differences are empha-
sized by the respondents in a high number, that differences
do found in the area among boys and girls. The differences
are mostly cultural and psychological where the behavioral
aspects also have a dominant role. The Pakhtun generation is
inculcated with identification of such differences since birth
though socialization.
In light of gender differences, males are labeled with to
show Ghairat or bravery which inculcated by the elders
through storytelling of the forefathers. They must act in a
traditional manner keeping the decorum of their culture in
mind. On the contrary, females are taught with emotionality
and delicacy through examples from the past. In addition,
females mostly urge on this outlook including their physique
in terms of delicacy while keeping the traditional norms.
Although they are less likely involved in beautification of
themselves, as it is against the customary law, yet traditional
Singhaar (makeup) is observed. Males in this category are
found to show aggression and bravery to reflect their domi-
nance and supremacy. Through this way, they take the bridle
of leadership and thus form a patriarchic structure. Females
on the contrary are taught to be submissive and obedient.
To authenticate the statement, interview (with Respondent
7, female teacher) has interesting information regarding
gender differences. As a female teacher, she expresses,
. . . of all the other obligations that a Pakhtun female has to obey
and follow, I was less likely taught about the gender differences.
As the environment of my home is educated and most of the
members are cooperative and open minded. I have taken my
education in coeducational institution and having an employed
status. Instead of all these facilitations, I have been restricted
and internalized with the gender differences. I have been
inculcated with the femininity, obedience, submission and
distance from the opposite gender. In most cases, I had to mix-up
with my colleagues in some kind of parties and functions, where
I was strictly discouraged to attend such gatherings where I had
to submit my will and obeyed. In this way, I learned and realized
the statement "Do as the Romans do," if I was to be part of the
culture, community, and family. Currently, I believe that both
the males and females are two sides of a stream that go parallel
to a long way, but can't meet.
The field information shows that gender differences are
not natural but rather the production of sociocultural pack-
ages where such packages are practiced in different institu-
tions especially in family. In a family, through socialization,
parents enact stereotypic images regarding male and female
where children learn all such differences and internalize
them. At early ages, individuals do not know about gender
differences where they are on the disposal of their parents;
children know about their gender as male or female, and
adopt roles that their parents prescribe to them.
In addition, it has been cleared from the findings of
research studies conducted so far along with current study
that there are differences between males and females, where
such differences are strengthened and internalized by both
genders through the process of gender socialization. In famil-
ial environment, parents are the primary influence on gender
role development in the early years of one's life (Kaplan,
1991; Miller, 1987; Santrock, 1994). Family in fact, unlike
other groups, is characterized by a specific way of living
(Donati, 1997; Saraceno, 1988) and constructing gender dif-
ferences through a process that is surely biological but also
relational and social. Family is the social and symbolic
place where difference in general and sexual difference in
Hussain et al. 5
particular are believed to be fundamental and at the same
time constructed (Donati, 2006).
In concluding remarks, it has been observed from second-
ary and field information that gender socialization is a means
to create gender differences whereby individuals learn about
their gender and adopt roles, which are viewed as gender
appropriate. In the course of socialization carried out in family
at early age, parents take in consideration the stereotypic
images of such differences while treating their children as
boys and girls where individuals are socialized differently
under the socially and culturally defined notions--stereotypes.
In this way, the proposed research assumption that "differen-
tial family environment, parental socialization and gender
socialization in family lead to the development of gender ste-
reotyping which further puts stress on traditional masculine
and feminine gender roles" is proved valid and authentic.
Parents' Role in Inculcation of Gender
Stereotyping
Research studies show that parental behavior toward their
children, either overt or covert, is the primary influence on
gender role stereotyping development in early life (Crespi,
2004; Kaplan, 1991; Santrock, 1994). Parents play a key role
in children's socialization and provide a suitable environ-
ment in family where they contact with their children in a
face to face interaction. Parents teach stereotypes through
different ways and behaviors in daily life, for example, the
way they use to dress their children and decorate their chil-
dren's rooms, the toys they give their children to play with,
and their own attitudes and behavior toward them that
increase the inculcation of gender stereotyping (Hetherington
& Parke, 1999).
In family, parents take in consideration the emotionality of
their children whenever they make conversations with them,
and similarly, they discuss matters differently with sons and
daughters (Dunn, Bretherton, & Munn, 1987). In this context,
parents especially mothers talk more with their daughters and
encourage them for more supportive and affiliative speech
and remarks in relation to others as compared with sons
(Leaper, Anderson, & Sanders, 1998; Leaper, Leve, Strasser,
& Schwartz, 1995). Contrary to this, mothers encourage inde-
pendence and autonomy in their sons (Pomerantz & Ruble,
1998), and they rarely discuss same matters with their daugh-
ters (Fivush, 1989). In regard of father and mother role in
gender socialization and stereotyping, Leaper (2000) identi-
fied that mothers as compared with fathers used to encourage
collaborative play with sons and daughters, but similarly, they
favor affiliative play with daughters; they are encouraged for
supportive and responsive interaction with others, whereas
the reaction of fathers was negative especially with their sons
for cross-gender behavior.
In addition, parents share their thoughts, experiences, and
behaviors with children and provide resources in the com-
munity to assist them in developing healthy gender attitudes
(Sales, Spjeldnes, & Koeshe, 2010). Parents also socialize
their children through storytelling, which is one of the domi-
nant ways of socialization whereby children learn regarding
their gender and gender role. Through storytelling, children
are familiarized with the valued attributes and personal traits.
In this regard, Fiese and Skillman (2000) have highlighted
many patterns of storytelling for the development of gender-
typed characteristics, values, and related traits among chil-
dren. These studies also identified that parents especially
fathers used to tell the stories of bravery, success, and
achievement to their sons, whereas mothers especially told
the stories of emotions, expression, relationship, and support
to their daughters (Fiese & Skillman, 2000).
Furthermore, it has also been identified that the emotion-
ality level of men and women is different where women are
viewed as emotionally passive, whereas men having mascu-
line attributes are aggressive. In this way, through the pro-
cess of socialization, gender stereotypes are developed and
inculcated inside family where parents treat their children
with an internalized stereotypic manner to enact their sons
with anger, strong, and agentic, whereas girls with passive,
weak, and delicate. This stereotypic socialization defines and
decides different and separated spheres both for male and
female and resultantly provides a ground for gender role
development. In the context of current research study, gender
stereotyping is socially constructed reality as supported by
the literature, which is deep-rooted in the sociocultural norms
of Pakhtun society. Under this gender stereotypic mecha-
nism, in Pakhtun traditional society, men are viewed as earn-
ers to support their families and are involved in buying and
selling, agricultural activities and jobs, and so on, and there-
fore are appreciated and encouraged both by parents and
community members (such notion is supported by majority
of interviewees). Similarly, the parents (teachers) were asked
how they treat their children where their replies show that
being parents living in traditional areas, they consider and
even teach their sons to be active, aggressive, brave, domi-
nant, and independent, whereas daughters are prescribed
with to-do household chores and are supposed to be submis-
sive, weak, and dependent (viewpoint of teachers in major-
ity). Such viewpoints and the obtained findings reflect the
inculcation of gender stereotypes facilitated by parents' role
and behavior, which they have with their children. Among
the respondents, the ideas of Respondent No 13 (male stu-
dent) have interesting elaborations, which reflect,
. . . I am a traditional and pure Pakhtun and love to follow
Pakhtunwali as my code for which I feel honored. My father has
been telling me the past and old stories of our grandparents, their
lives, their culture, their activities and so on. I have been told
with the old Hujra (guest house) system where decisions were
used to be taken for conflicts by an elder who was my
grandparent. Since my childhood, I have conceptualized the
picture of those brilliant personalities in my mind and I try to act
like them somehow at times. During my childhood and teenage
I used to draw beard and moustaches on my face through a
6 SAGE Open
marker and pencil, wore his Paghrhi (turban), handed his Kontai
(stick) and sit in Hujra. Some of my village-mates were asked to
be the servants and the remaining were the parties having
conflict on land or other matters for which I made the decisions.
Such acting has been so deeply internalized in my mind that
those personalities have become my role models and I believe
that all Pakhtun males should be like them. Pakhtun must be
brave, aggressive, decision-maker, fighter, muscular and
un-fearing of any threat or situation.
The findings observed so far from the extracts of inter-
views explicitly indicate that the stereotypic images--
notions such as anger, bravery, boldness, cooperativeness,
decision making, and so on--related to males and females
are not inherent but rather developed among individuals
through the process of socialization. The family or parents
teach their children in a way to give them an impression to
exhibit such type of masculine characteristics as members of
society and culture.
Similarly, however, field information reflects that a
Pakhtun female should be of contrary nature where she has
to be passive, low tuned (while talking), caretaker of others,
cooperative, shy, and so on (views of respondents in major-
ity) In addition, similar views have been documented from
the extracts (of interview) of Respondent 21 (female inter-
viewee) as
. . . we have been taught under the rules of Pakhtunwali in family
that women are born in the four walls; they have to live inside
the four walls and after death to be again buried in the four walls
of the grave. Such inculcation reflect the strict observance of
Purdah (veil) on female folk as we (all females in the family)
have to keep distance from male members whether relatives or
outsiders. In addition, it has been emphasized on us to cool,
calm and less talkative when males (particularly elders) are at
home, while strictly directed to keep the tone of voice at lowest
level when talking at home. Further, we have to submit our wills
in decisions taken for family or individuals that also include our
personal matters such education, mate selection, employment or
property. In this connection, our familial and cultural norms
have been settled and we are obeying them whole heartedly.
(Similar remarks also noted from the extractions of interviews
with Respondents 3, 10, 14, 17, and 22)
While analyzing the mentioned facts about both cases, it
is clear that men (among Pakhtun) are lying at the dominant
edge, whereas women at the low. Men are the decision mak-
ers for the whole community being elder of the village,
whereas women are unable even to decide their own personal
matters. Such are the stereotypical images that have been
emerged from the prevalent normative structure in collabora-
tion with customary law of the culture. Resultantly, these
images are inculcated and internalized by the young genera-
tion of Pakhtun society where parents play a dominant role.
It is clear from the aforementioned discussion that parents
play a key role in the development of gender and gender role
in early years of life. Parents encourage their children for
gender appropriate activities, such as they emphasize on girls
to play with dolls and boys with trucks as supported by
research studies (Eccles, Jacobs, & Harold, 1990). In addi-
tion, parents send predetermined messages to children that
they think will give signals to sexes for gender appropriate
role (Arliss, 1991). Parents also adopt different ways to
speak and play differently with boys and girls. They use
reward if the children conform to and punishment if the chil-
dren intent to break the normative order of gender roles, for
example, when a boy plays with dolls, he is discouraged and
similarly, a general statement is made that boys are emotion-
ally strong and should not adopt feminine games and charac-
ters (Gleitman et al., 2000; Morris, 1988). Similarly, if the
parents do not send any messages intentionally, it is enough
for children to notice the differences between sexes by
observing the adults in surrounding; thus, they observe and
notice others and accordingly behave. In this connection, the
prevalent stereotypic knowledge, that is, men are instrumen-
tal, aggressive, and tough, whereas women are emotionally
expressive and submissive, is enough for children to act like-
wise. Finally, the findings drawn from field information and
secondary data validate the assumption that differential
parental socialization inside family leads to the development
of gender stereotyping and gender role formation.
Differential Treatment in Family and Gender
Stereotyping
The available literature and secondary sources highlighted
that gender stereotypes are deeply rooted within the realm of
sociocultural structure and are transferred to next generation
through the process of socialization (Basow, 1992). In this
regard, most of the traditional societies have made strong
distinctions between the traits and attributes associated to
gender, whereas this is not the case with few developed soci-
eties (Davidson & Gordon, 1979). Children in familial envi-
ronment are socialized differently, where the parents try to
prepare their offspring for appropriate gender roles. In this
connection, Basow (1992) extracted from her research find-
ings that due to differential treatment in family, children
behave and develop their role differently. For example, in
most of the traditional cultural setups, boys are discouraged
to cry; they are also prepared to be emotionally strong in
painful and unfavorable situations. An expression of bravery
and strength is given by resembling them to tigers where it is
assumed that tigers do not cry, whereas this is not the case
with girls, because they are considered weak. Keeping such
notions in view, boys being strong and brave are socialized to
be competitive and success-oriented (Booysen & De Witt,
1995). Furthermore, parents use their internalized differen-
tial treatment while socializing their children, which means
that their beliefs and values will affect their parenting skills.
What knowledge and beliefs regarding gender and gender
role parents have acquired will be transferred consciously or
unconsciously to their children. In this regard, to clarify the
Hussain et al. 7
theme of current research study regarding differential treat-
ment and gender stereotyping in the context of family, views
of the respondents are illustrated as follows:
. . . In our traditional family system, males and females are
treated differently. Our parents tend to encourage male children
to be active and girls to be passive. Most of our parents are very
close to their sons as compared to daughters. (Interviewees 7,
15, 16, 23, and 24, respectively)
There seems an obvious demarcation between male and
female segments pertaining to treatment by the parents. In
this regard, views of one of the female respondents have
been elaborated as follows, where she expresses,
. . . treating male and female differently is a passion as well as
fashion in the current scenario of cultured and traditionally
founded societies. Although I have not been deprived of the
rights that are deemed necessary in my survival, growth and
well-being yet if I analyze my life critically there seems some
kind of discriminative treatment with us. I (even all the females
in my home) am treated differently than my brothers and other
male members at home in different aspects of life. Here I would
express that discrimination in serving the food to males earlier
than that of males is discrimination as it hits the sense of
inferiority. In addition, we have always been suggested and
directed while selecting a dress for us where males had the
authority to wear what they desired for. Besides, I have observed
an obvious difference in my schooling where I hadn't any say to
select the institution and field for my studies which solely in the
hands of my elder males. The most irritating and important
decision of life is considered as mate selection to whom we are
liable to spend the whole life, is thoroughly out of our access
where males have the authority in this context. On the basis of
such differences, it is obvious that there is a gendered culture in
our society that restricts our mobility and movement as well and
makes the female segment a dependant and oppressed stream.
Similarly, an example can be extracted from the work of
Basow (1992), where she argued that it is evident that par-
ents' differential treatment and reaction affect children's
behavior in the future endeavors of life; for example, par-
ents have been observed reacting negatively to their chil-
dren, especially girls, whenever the girls are observed in
masculine character and boys in feminine character.
Deferential treatment of parents has also been observed in
case of toy selection that the buy for boys and girls, while
its intensity becomes high and significant, whenever par-
ents prefer to assign household activities to girls and out-
door chores to boys.
Furthermore, in most of the research studies, it has also
been observed that parents' differential behavior with boys
and girls in a single familial environment sharpen the preva-
lence of gender differences in daily life. Mostly, the parents
follow the traditional, already defined, and socially con-
structed notions, that is, stereotypes while socializing children,
where these stereotypes represent the collective knowledge,
customs and traditions, and convictions and conventions of the
society concerned (Macrae, Stangor, & Hewstone, 1996).
Through the help of this projection, individuals learn to
develop a stereotypic belief regarding the group with whom
they belong, which in the long run affect their behavior or role.
Such stereotypic behavior is learned, transmitted, and changed
in the course of socialization. With respect to socialization,
family reinforces the existing stereotypic knowledge to the
youngsters.
The aforementioned discussion indicates that gender dif-
ferences are not biological, but rather sociocultural and rela-
tional, where these differences are primarily identified and
then inculcated in family. Likewise in other societies and
cultures, family is considered one of the basic and primary
sources of socialization where children, youngsters, and
adults are socialized. Family holds the responsibility to teach
individuals about gender appropriate behavior and guide
them regarding the cultural and societal expectations of the
sex-typed activities. Inside family, boys and girls are social-
ized differently under the existing socially and culturally
defined patterns regarding males and females. Furthermore,
they are trained to adopt specific masculine and feminine
roles; these gender roles are assigned to them under the pre-
vailing stereotypic image of males and females, which are
considered constant and pervasive.
The information obtained from secondary sources and
field data validate the proposed assumption that differential
familial environment, parental socialization, appreciation,
and discouragement lead to the development of gender ste-
reotyping and role formation. This assumption also adds
knowledge to the Social Learning Theory which focuses
upon gender socialization, imitation, as well as reward and
punishment that find children while living in family.
Division of Labor in Family and Gender
Stereotyping
In the course of gender socialization, parents treat their chil-
dren differently and assign them different tasks considered
appropriate to their gender. In this context, parents follow the
already defined notions--stereotypes that are constant and
pervasive in each and every society and culture of the world.
Furthermore, in family sphere, activities are divided between
males and females on the basis of their gender where males
are supposed to handle outdoor activities such as farming,
business, shopping, and other having masculine or energetic
characteristics, whereas female are assumed to handle
domestic chores such as cooking, washing, sweeping, and
taking care of youngsters. This sort of division of labor is
also prevalent in Pakhtun society where on the basis of pre-
determined notion--stereotyping regarding males and
females--they are viewed fit for certain activities. Among
Pakhtuns, this division seems very much unique because of
its strict nature where both genders are restricted to follow
the expected pattern of behavior as well as the larger societal
8 SAGE Open
expectations. The domestic sphere, which is specified only
for females, is highly emphasized, and their participation in
outdoor activities is strongly discouraged. Similarly, male
members in Pakhtun society are directed to be the followers
of masculine expectations and not to be indulged in feminine
activities.
Relevant to findings extracted from secondary data, filed
information analyzes the mentioned phenomenon addressing
Pakhtun culture with its uniformity and variability. In the
context of cultural uniformity, just like other cultures,
Pakhtuns also exhibit the patterns related to division of labor
between two genders; they confine women to domestic
chores and men to outdoor activities. However, as far as the
variability is concerned, Pakhtun culture has certain different
and unique ways to assign domestic sphere merely to women,
and activities out of house are regarded as men-oriented with
strong prohibition for both genders not to participate in the
sphere of opposite gender (supported by majority of respon-
dents). Furthermore, to validate the argument about stereo-
typic division of labor in Pakhtun familial sphere, views of
the interviewed respondents are illustrated where they were
of the opinion that
. . . family is the place where we are socialized and come to
know about their gender as male and female. To them, gender
role identification is carried out through clear and strict division
of labor where parents prescribe certain activities specific for
boys and girls.These activities are considered gender appropriate
in our culture. Under this division of labor males are supposed to
handle outdoor activities like farming, shopping, business,
earning etc while females are confined to domestic chores like
cooking, washing, take care of youngsters, helping mothers, etc.
(Response of the Interviewed Respondents 1, 3, 8, 14, and 15,
respectively)
In this connection, Interviewee 15 (male respondent)
reflects unique information where the division of labor
expresses the gender stereotyping in the area. He expresses,
. . . I have been taught to behave as a traditional Pakhtun following
all the codes of Pakhtunwali and obliging the expected role. In
response, I persevered not to compromise on my manly-Pakhtun
outlook and deal things and situations as expected. At some
stages I feel the situation of my sisters very pathetic and poignant
where they work from dawn to dusk having no acknowledgment.
I also have tried to discuss the issue with my parents that being
members of the family and house it is also our obligation to take
care of the different activities such as cooking, or washing the
floor, which was denied. At few moments, I assisted my sisters in
washing the floor and helped them out when they were cooking.
I was amazed that even my mother scolded me and taunted that
these are womanly jobs and men should not be involved. In
addition, she reflected that men having assistance to women in
domestic chores bring bad omen to the family home, which was
distressful for me. Besides, my father was informed when I didn't
abrogate the assist them, who in response treated me harshly and
threatened for bad consequences if I didn't abandon what I was
doing. It seems as if the tasks assigned to us are heavenly and
prescribed in the Holy Scriptures because they are enforced too
strictly.
With reference to division of labor in the family, field data
show that to sustain familial matters, activities are divided
among family members on the basis of gender where the phi-
losophy behind division of labor is to assign different roles to
males and females. This sort of division of labor in family
creates a dichotomy and promotes gender stereotyping which
play its role in gender role formation.
Similarly, various research studies have supported the
prevalence of division of labor creating gender stereotyping.
It has been observed that men and women perform different
jobs; men work outside the home, whereas women work
inside the home as unpaid housewives, where such dichot-
omy is internalized by children from very early age, and they
remain attached with such stereotypic gender roles in their
future (Gleitman et al., 2000). In addition, in domestic
sphere, parents also assign different tasks to boys and girls
on the basis of attached characteristics to each gender; boys
are given the responsibilities to do maintenance-related
activities, such as mowing the lawn, and girls are expected to
handle the tasks of cooking and washing (Basow in Witt,
1997). The mentioned segregation of gender-related tasks
creates awareness among individuals whereby they come to
know that certain tasks have been restricted to males and are
known as masculine tasks and others to females referred to
as feminine tasks (Witt, 1997).
It is concluded from the discussion that family is the place
where individuals come in contact with family members and
find them a source for their upbringing and socialization.
Equally important with the role of other family members,
parents play a pivotal role to socialize their children. Familial
environment shapes and reshapes individuals' attitudes and
personality and guides them for gender appropriate behavior.
In family, parents start teaching children's roles shortly after
birth, for example, boys are cuddled, kissed, and stroked less
than girls, whereas girls are less often tossed and handled
roughly. In playing with their infants, parents appreciate and
praise the activities of boys for being tough and hard due to
which boys realized themselves as superior. From then
onward, in peers' company, in schools, and even in work-
place, the idea that males are superior is reinforced. This gen-
dered and biased family relationship is internalized by the
individuals and then used as an institutionalized mechanism.
Under this mechanism, most of the decisions such as mar-
riage, business, economic, and so on, are carried out by the
dominant male segment in the family. It further restricts the
roles of both males and females in different spheres of
life such as education, jobs, or other decisions. Finally, in the
light of concluding remarks, the proposed assumption that
"differential family environment, parental socialization, and
gender socialization in family lead to the development of
gender stereotyping which further puts stress on traditional
Hussain et al. 9
masculine and feminine gender roles," is approved and
validated.
Findings and Conclusion
The data reveal that gender stereotyping is a sociocultural
production, which is developed and inculcated in the net-
work of institutions, social interaction, and social relation-
ships. In contributing sources, family is the dominant one,
which is a milestone in the inculcation of gender difference
through gender socialization, gender differentiation, division
of labor, and differential parental role in the context of
Pakhtun patterns of males and females or masculinity and
femininity. The data show that family teaches individuals
about gender appropriate and inappropriate behavior and
guides them regarding the cultural and societal expected
channels. Such roles are assigned to individuals and are
ensured through division of labor and differential association
in their daily life of traditional gender stereotyping where the
traditional gender roles are emphasized and even encour-
aged, whereas contemporary social roles especially for
females are discouraged. The extracted findings indicate that
differential treatment of parents to view their daughters as
delicate, weak, emotional, sensitive, and dependent, and sons
as strong, aggressive, brave, and independent encourages
children to behave respectfully.
Similarly, parents' differential and stereotypic treatment
projects gender differences and segregation when they dress
their children, decorate children's rooms, give them toys to
play with, and so on, by following certain defined and
approved patterns of Pakhtun culture that inculcate gender ste-
reotyping and form gender roles. In addition, in family, parents
assign certain activities to males such as outdoor matters such
as earning, farming, shopping, and so on, whereas females are
confined to domestic chores such cooking, washing, and car-
ing of youngsters, which directly or indirectly project gender
stereotypic division of labor. The study findings show the gen-
dered and biased familial environment which is internalized
by individuals in the context of boys and girls differently and
becomes a base for institutionalized behaviors as males and
females in various spheres of life when they come out of fam-
ily such as peers association, education, and employment.
The overall discussion thus concludes that gender stereo-
typing and gender role formation are not biological but rather
sociocultural and relational where such entities are the out-
come of gender socialization, differential familial environ-
ment, traditional and stereotypic division of labor, and
parents' differential role with children. Family in Pakhtun
society as a biological and social unit socializes children,
youngsters, and adults in the respective manners--predeter-
mined notions of masculinity and femininity which play a
substantial role in the development of gender stereotyping.
Similarly, gender role formation is a relational process embed-
ded in the sociocultural ream of Pakhtun society where indi-
viduals are assigned different roles specific to males and
females and expect them to perform their roles according to a
normative order. In this mechanism, society adopts the
socially defined and culturally approved notions to make a
criterion for the assignment of roles to males and females on
the basis of their sex characteristics or qualities where these
notions become compulsive and are referred to as gender ste-
reotypes. Gender stereotyping as a process reflects the mean-
ings of what men and women are and what they should be,
creating a dichotomy of gender role in different spheres of life
such as family sphere, peers, education, workplace, and so on.
Recommendations
In the light of findings and results extracted from current
research study, few recommendations are put forwarded to
sort out gender stereotyping embedded in the sociocultural
fabric of Pakhtun society especially in the sphere of family.
The recommendations are given below.
Familial Environment
Gender stereotypes are primarily developed in family in
early ages and then strengthened by gender socialization, dif-
ferential parental treatment, and parental role model of
behavior toward children. These stereotypes have long-term
effects over the lives of individuals such as their education,
employment, and other spheres in which they participate.
Therefore, it is essential to sort out gender stereotyping at the
earliest age, thereby changing parents' psyche and attitudes.
Their behavior with children should be free of discrimination
and stereotypic attitudes. In this regard, there is need to con-
vince parents especially fathers to adopt gender-balanced
behavior while socializing and treating their children. In
addition, to prevent children from adopting gender stereotyp-
ing belief systems requires conscious efforts from parents to
challenge stereotypes and also for the roles and behaviors
adopted by adults themselves to become de-gendered.
Gender Mainstreaming
To address gender concerns holistically, it is essential to
mainstream gender in all institutions of society especially in
family. Gender mainstreaming is the process whereby an
assessment and implication for men and women of all
planned actions such as legislation, policies, or other pro-
grams at all levels is carried out. It is a strategy for making
women's as well as men's concerns and experiences an inte-
gral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring,
and evaluation of policies and programs in all socioeconomic
and political spheres so that women and men benefit equally.
Role of Media
Media constantly reinforces the traditional stereotypes of
women and men and thus needs to be addressed to promote
10 SAGE Open
gender equality by using a gender lens sensitively. Media
should project positive aspects of society, thereby highlight-
ing the negative stereotypes, especially women's stereotypes,
in the context of family. Media should play a role to discour-
age women's confinement merely to domestic chores and
men's roles to outdoor activities. As such type of projection is
apparent in both electronic and printed media, where through
different advertisements, pictorial presentation, stage dramas
and movies. In addition, media should highlight that women's
role in life is changing worldwide as well as in Pakistan; it is,
therefore, necessary for media to motivate women for adopt-
ing new and demanding roles that are deemed necessary for
their socioeconomic empowerment and development.

Notes
1. Pakhtun is an ethnic group mostly living in the province of
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa having distinct lifestyle under the
umbrella of Pakhtunwali.
2. Patriarchy is an important concept of sociology used to cover
various aspects and dimensions of human life, but for the pur-
pose of current research study, this term has been defined and
used in a single frame, that is, the domination of man over
woman merely in familial and related aspects.
3. The selected universities in the area provided a ground where
male and female students and teachers easily shared their
knowledge and experiences regarding gender stereotyping.
Being educated, female teachers and students of the universi-
ties are not fully free from the deep-rooted cultural restrictions.
Although there are certain spheres where females' position is
in transition and whereby they are not more caged in the cul-
turally constructed gender dichotomy of masculine and femi-
nine role structure in the traditional Pakhtun society, being part
of this culture and society, they have passed and are passing
from the experiences related to gender stereotyping. Therefore,
females (students and teachers) were included in the samples of
8 respondents making 50% of the whole from each university. In
this regard, the sample of 8 respondents has been taken with the
ratio of 2 male students, 2 male teachers, 2 female students, and
2 female teachers, which further gives the justification of gender
equality and research objectivity. Similarly, the researcher has
taken a sample size of 24 respondents for this research study.
4. Folk and indigenous games mostly played in the rural areas of
Pakhtun society.
