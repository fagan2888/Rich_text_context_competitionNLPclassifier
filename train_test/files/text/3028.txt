AND UNDERINSURED

THE STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH
Insurance Program (CHIP),
passed by Congress as part of
the Balanced Budget Act of
1997, is intended to extend health in-
surance coverage to a significant pro-
portion of the nation's uninsured chil-
dren, thereby increasing their access to
health care services.1 The program pro-
vides for generous federal grants to
states, which in turn have substantial
latitude in designing the specifics of
their programs. Targeted on unin-
sured children in families with in-
comes less than 200% of the federal
poverty level, CHIP will provide ei-
ther Medicaid or private insurance cov-
erage. The latter must guarantee a ben-
efit package consistent with state or
federalemployees'benefits,butwithup-
per limits on cost-sharing amounts to
protect low-income children. Most of
the states plan to use Medicaid as their
CHIP mechanism, either wholly (27
states) or in combination with a pri-
vate insurance program (10 states).2
There is an extensive literature com-
paring access to care for uninsured and
insured children.3-10 Being uninsured re-
duces the likelihood a child has any
physician contact during a time pe-
riod and reduces the number of visits
for a child with some contact. The full
effect is about 30% to 50% fewer visits
by uninsured children than those in-
sured by either Medicaid or private in-
surance.Clearly,then,theevidencesug-
gests that CHIP will lead to increased
use among those who participate in the
program.
A limitation of this literature, how-
ever, is that with only 1 exception, it
is based on national data. In contrast,
the CHIP program is to be undertaken
by individual states, and policymak-
ers care about differential impacts in
their own jurisdictions. These differ-
ences may be substantial. There exist
differences among states in the health
status of children and their access to
care, which may affect program out-

Context Although an extensive literature exists comparing national access to health
care for uninsured vs insured children, few data exist regarding differences in access
across states.
Objective To examine variation in access to physician services for uninsured children in
10 states, the safety net's role in explaining this variation, and the potential effects of the
State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) on insurance coverage and access.
Design and Setting The population-based Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Fam-
ily Health Insurance Survey, conducted between summer 1993 and spring 1994 in 10
states (Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Okla-
homa, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington), with a response rate of families by state
ranging from 61% to 83%.
Participants A total of 8565 children who were uninsured (1586), covered by Med-
icaid (2723), or covered by employer-sponsored private insurance (4256) for 1 full
year prior to the survey.
Main Outcome Measures Percentage of low-income children who are uninsured
and predicted annual physician visits by state if insurance was provided to uninsured
children in families with incomes of less than 200% of poverty level.
Results In the 10 study states, low-income children ranged from 61% to 86% of all
uninsured children and the uninsured rate for low-income children varied from 9% to
31%. On average, providing public coverage would increase annual physician visits
from 2.3 to 4.6 (a 105% increase), but the increase would range from 41% to 189%
across states. The annual physician visit rate in the 3 states with the highest access for
the uninsured was 160% of that in the 3 lowest-access states. Safety net capacity in
the high-access states ranged from 120% to 220% of that in the low-access states.
Conclusions Our data suggest that the potential effects of CHIP vary substantially
across states. Notably, improvements in access to health care by uninsured low-
income children should be greater in states with the fewest safety net resources.

comes.11 In addition, diversity in state
regulations and programs has pro-
duced significant interstate variation
in all aspects of the health care sys-
tem.12,13 Therefore, to assess the poten-
tial and limitations of new state pro-
grams targeted to the uninsured
requires information about how ac-
cess differs across states.
The purpose of this article is to ex-
amine variation in access to physician
services for uninsured children in 10
states and to explore the role the safety
net plays in this variation. Using simu-
lation methods, we also investigate the
likely improvements in access under a
new public insurance program for low-
income uninsured children in the 10
states. To date, all but 2 states have re-
ceived approval from the Health Care
Financing Administration for a CHIP
plan to expand coverage of children.2
However, at least 20 states indicate they
are still developing the fully phased-in
CHIP program.14 Thus, it will be some
years until the CHIP programs are fully
implemented and several years be-
yond that before postimplementation
empirical evidence is available on the
effects of the programs. Therefore, our
simulation analysis provides policy-
makers with current information about
the potential implications of CHIP.
METHODS
Data
Data for our study come from the Rob-
ert Wood Johnson Foundation Family
Health Insurance Survey conducted in
10 states between summer 1993 and
spring 1994. The states were Colo-
rado, Florida, Minnesota, New Mexico,
New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma,
Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.
They were selected for the Founda-
tion's State Initiatives in Health Care Re-
form program through a competitive
application process,15 but the selec-
tion was designed to include both large
and small states and states in all re-
gions of the country. The states span
the range of variation observed in all 50
states in important population, health
system, and health policy characteris-
tics including age, education, race, in-
come, health maintenance organiza-
tion enrollments, physicians per capita,
health spending per capita, and state
health care spending per capita.11,16
They also represent the range of exist-
ing state health care financing pro-
grams for children as measured by the
number of Medicaid children per 1000
children (ranging from 168-341 in the
10 states vs 168-388 among all states)
and Medicaid expenditures per en-
rolled child (ranging from $870-
$1970 in the 10 states and $630-
$1970 nationwide).17 States are an
appropriate geographic unit for our
analyses because they are the relevant
jurisdiction for CHIP policy.
More than 2000 twenty-five-
minute telephone interviews were con-
ducted with families in each state. Fami-
lies with Medicaid enrollees or
uninsured persons were oversampled
using a general population telephone
screening interview. The Medicaid
population identified in the screening
interview was supplemented by sam-
pling from program enrollment lists in
9 of the 10 states. Finally, households
without telephones in a small number
of geographic areas in each state were
identified and interviewed in person.
Response rates ranged from 61% in New
York to 83% in North Dakota.
The interview unit was the family.
Within families, the survey collected de-
mographic and insurance information
about all children in the family and
asked about the health status and uti-
lization of a randomly selected child.
This yielded complete data for 11 857
children. We used this sample to esti-
mate the number of low-income unin-
sured children in each state, which mea-
sures the potential impact of CHIP if
all children eligible for public insur-
ance enrolled in it.
To estimate access effects of provid-
ing coverage to low-income uninsured
children, we modelled physician visits
as described below. To fit the model, we
restricted the sample to children who
were uninsured for the full year prior to
the survey, those who were covered by
Medicaidorspecialstate-sponsoredpro-
grams (eg, MinnesotaCare) during the
entire year, or those who were covered
by private employer-sponsored insur-
ance (including the Civilian Health and
Medical Program of the Uniformed Ser-
vices [CHAMPUS]) for the full year. We
limited our sample to those whose in-
surance remained constant for the year
because our health service utilization
measures were also for the preceding
year. Lack of congruence between the
measure of insurance and the measure
of health service use can lead to biased
estimates of the effect of insurance sta-
tus.18 Moreover, other research has
shown that the relationship between
healthcareuseandinsurancestatusdoes
not differ for the continuously unin-
sured and those in insurance transi-
tions during the period of uninsur-
ance,19,20 andsotheexclusionshouldnot
bias our estimates of the relationship.
We also excluded children who were
covered by more than 1 type of insur-
ance program during the year and those
covered by private, individual insur-
ance.Finally,weexcludedchildren who
were entitled to Medicaid because they
were receiving Supplemental Security
Income. These children were eligible for
Medicaid because they had special
health problems. Including them in our
model might result in selection bias in
our estimates of the insurance effect,
and so in our simulation of the effect
of an expanded public insurance pro-
gram.4 The sample used in fitting our
analytic model included a total of 8565
children in the 10 states, of whom 1586
were uninsured, 2723 were covered by
Medicaid, and 4256 were covered by
employer-sponsored private insur-
ance. Each state was given equal weight
in the analysis. Within states, weights
were used to account for differential
sampling probabilities.
We collected secondary data on
health care safety net resources by
state.17,21-24 Each safety net quantity was
then expressed as a proportion of some
denominator--for example, public hos-
pital beds divided by total hospital beds.
When the safety net resource gener-
ally served a subset of the population,
the chosen denominator reflects an at-
tempt to measure the appropriate in-

come, insurance, or demographic group
that is served. Some of the measures we
used are indicators of capacity while
others include dimensions of both ca-
pacity and service utilization. Because
we compared differences between states
in the measures of the safety net with
differences between them in our esti-
mates of access for uninsured chil-
dren, we would have preferred pure
measures of capacity. However, mea-
suresthataccuratelyreflectcapacitywere
not always available. For example,
simple counts of physical plant (such as
the number of hospital emergency and
outpatient departments) do not mea-
sure the number of patients that can be
served. In such case, we have used uti-
lization as the measure to standardize
differences in the number of physical
plants per state. We believe the consis-
tency of the relationships we observed
for both the pure capacity measures and
those that included some component of
utilization supports our conclusions.
Stateswereclassifiedashaving"high"
vs "low" safety net capacity. To do so,
the states were ordered from highest to
lowest on each of the 5 safety net ca-
pacity measures collected and were as-
signed a rank from 1 to 10 consecu-
tively. The 5 rankings for each state
were then summed to create an index;
the 3 states with the highest rankings
(lowest index values) were deemed to
have high safety net capacity, whereas
the 3 with the lowest rankings (high-
est index values) were classified in the
low-capacity group.
Estimation of Access Effects
We used a 2-part multivariate model to
estimate the relationship between in-
surance status and ambulatory care vis-
its for the children in our analytic
sample. The first part was a logit model
for the probability of having an ambu-
latory physician visit in a year; the sec-
ond part was a linear regression for the
logarithm of the number of visits for
those who have at least one. Both mod-
els included indicator variables for
the type of insurance the individual
had (uninsured, private employer-
sponsored coverage, or Medicaid); in-
dicators for the state; the child's age, sex,
race, and health status; the family in-
come expressed as a percentage of pov-
erty; and interactions of insurance sta-
tus with health status and family
income. To capture state differences in
utilization patterns in different pro-
grams, we also allowed for differences
among the states in the effect of insur-
ance and for differences in the insur-
ance and income interaction by state by
including terms interacting the state in-
dicators with these other variables.
We used the model to predict or
simulate the number of ambulatory care
physician visits that each low-income
uninsured child would have if unin-
sured all year and if insured for a full
year. The simulated value for each child
is the product of the predicted prob-
ability of use from the logistic model
times the predicted number of visits.
The latter is the exponential of the pre-
dicted value from the regression times
a factor to retransform from the loga-
rithmic scale to the raw quantity scale.25
We first used the model to predict an-
nual uninsured visit rates for each cur-
rently uninsured child. We used the
model rather than observed values be-
cause some of these children were in-
sured for part of the year, so observed
visits will be higher than rates of use
while uninsured.
We then predicted the number of vis-
its that each of these children would
make if enrolled in Medicaid to repre-
sent use under a new state insurance
program for the uninsured, because
most states' CHIP plans involve Med-
icaid expansions and will provide Med-
icaid benefits. Medicaid managed care
enrollments have increased rapidly--
from 14.4% in 1993 to 47.8% in 1997.26
However, most physicians are still re-
imbursed on a fee-for-service basis and
so their practice styles are not likely to
be altered.27 Moreover, other research
suggests that managed care alters hos-
pital use rates, but that there are few dif-
ferences in ambulatory care visit rates
between the managed care and fee-for-
servicedeliverysystems.20 Therefore,we
believe our estimates of predicted Med-
icaid visits based on 1993 data are still
likely to be valid for the current Med-
icaid program.
We also predicted what each unin-
sured child's use would be if covered
by private employer-sponsored cover-
age for the year to estimate how use pat-
terns would change if the new public
program required greater patient cost
sharing than Medicaid.
The tables that follow show the pre-
dictions averaged over all of the unin-
sured children in our sample in the
state. (The regression equations on
which these predictions are based are
available on request to the authors.) We
measured variation between the states
in access rates by the coefficient of varia-
tion--the SD of the 10 state estimates
divided by the unweighted mean of the
state estimates. We compared differ-
ences between the states in predicted
access with differences in safety net ca-
pacity. This is an indirect estimate of
the effect of the safety net, rather than
a direct estimate of the relationship that
would be obtained by including these
measures in the multivariate models.
We could not include the safety net
measures, which are state-specific mea-
sures, directly in our regressions be-
causeweusedafixed-effectsmodel with
state indicators and interactions of state
indicators and other key variables. We
chose this approach to capture the
myriad of differences between states in
health care policies and programs and
the effect they may have on access. With
only 10 states, we do not have enough
df to include measures for each of the
important programs and policies that
vary among the states. If safety net ca-
pacity is correlated with other state poli-
cies that affect access, however, our ap-
proach may overstate the marginal
contribution of the safety net.
RESULTS
There are substantial differences among
states in the potential of a public in-
surance program to expand coverage of
low-income uninsured children. In our
survey states, the uninsured rate for
low-income children ranged from
9% in Vermont to 31% in Florida
(TABLE 1). As a proportion of all un-

insured children, the low-income group
ranged from 61% in Vermont to 86%
in New Mexico. These disparities,
which have been documented by oth-
ers, suggest that there will be consid-
erable differences in the magnitude of
the coverage effects of CHIP among
states.28 They are a reflection of past dif-
ferences in private insurance cover-
age, in Medicaid and other public in-
surance programs, and in the income
distribution of families with children.
We predict that expanding public in-
surance would substantially improve
access for low-income uninsured chil-
dren (TABLE 2). On average in the 10
states, use would rise from 2.3 visits to
4.6 visits per year (a 105% increase).
We used behavior for children under
Medicaid and state-only insurance pro-
grams for low-income populations to
estimate the effect of a new program be-
cause few states have imposed cost shar-
ing that exceeds Medicaid levels in their
CHIP programs. Should states impose
greater cost sharing, use could be sig-
nificantly lower. Specifically, we pre-
dict low-income uninsured children
would have about 3.5 visits with cost
sharing comparable to that in existing
private plans, or only about one-half the
improvement predicted with benefits
comparable to Medicaid.
The increases in utilization would
vary substantially from state to state,
however,rangingfromlowsofonly41%
in Minnesota and 50% in New York, to
highs of 135% in New Mexico and Ver-
mont and 189% in Oregon. Access dif-
ferences for the uninsured and those in
publicprogramsdifferedsignificantlybe-
tween the states (2
9
= 13.0 for the prob-
ability of use; 2
9
= 17.4 for the number
of visits among users). These differ-
ences have little to do with differences
in service use under public insurance
programs for children--the levels of use
among the states were pretty tightly dis-
tributed around the mean. Instead, they
have much more to do with state-
specific differences in use by unin-
sured children. The coefficient of varia-
tion in uninsured use was about twice
that for the insured use (Table 2). The
differences in the use rates by the un-
insured among states are significantly
different (2
9
= 42.8 for the probability
of use; 2
9
= 17.0 for the number of vis-
its among users).
We investigated whether differ-
ences between states in the demo-
graphic and health characteristics of
their uninsured children account for the
variation in access by predicting val-
ues for each state using a standardized
population. Results for the standard-
ized population were essentially the
same as those for the state's own un-
insured children and are not pre-
sented here. Thus, we conclude that
population differences do not account
for the state-to-state variation.
We explored another possible cause
of the state variation--specifically, the
availability of safety net services to the
uninsured, which serve as a partial sub-
stitute for having insurance.29 TABLE 3
shows several measures of health safety
net resources for the 3 states with the
highest access for the uninsured (Colo-
rado, Minnesota, and New York) and
the 3 states with the lowest access (New
Mexico, Oregon, and Vermont). The es-
timates shown are based on simple
means of the estimates for the 3 indi-
vidual states--that is, they are not
weighted by each state's population--
because our objective was to use these
states as observations to characterize
circumstances in similarly situated
states that were not studied. The high-
access states, where utilization by un-
insured children is 160% of that in the
low-access states, had 120% to 220%
more safety net capacity depending on
the particular measure considered.
The results were similar when ex-
plored from another perspective. We
ranked states according to their safety
net capacity across the 5 measures
presented in Table 3. The 3 highest-
capacity states (Florida, New York, and
Washington) had an average pre-
dicted use rate for uninsured children
that was 129% of that for the 3 lowest
safety net capacity states in our study
(North Dakota, Oregon, and Ver-
mont). Limiting the ranking to the 3
safety net measures that are indepen-
dent of utilization resulted in 5 of the
6 states remaining in their respective
group and a relative use rate of 126%.
COMMENT
Our simulations of an illustrative pub-
lic insurance program for low-income
uninsured children suggest that CHIP
promises to have significant effects,
both on the number of children who

will be newly insured and on their ac-
cess to physician services. These ef-
fects will vary significantly among the
states, however, not only because of the
size and the income distribution of the
pool of uninsured children, but also be-
cause of differences in baseline use of
physician services. We found evi-
dence to suggest that the states vary in
their contributions from the safety net,
with a resultant effect on access for the
uninsured.
Our results show the potential for the
CHIP program, but several factors may
alter the actual outcomes. CHIP may
not reach all of the targeted unin-
sured. Participation rates in public pro-
grams fall far short of universal, and par-
ticipation rates are likely to vary among
states because of differences in the
implementation of CHIP. Thus, our es-
timates of the number of low-income
uninsured will overstate the number of
children the CHIP program is targeted
to reach who will actually be covered.
On the other hand, some families may
shift children from employer plans
to CHIP--the "crowd-out" effect--
which would increase the number of
children enrolled. But there would not
be access gains for those who have sub-
stituted private insurance for public in-
surance, except to the extent that the
public program provides more com-
prehensive coverage than the existing
private coverage. Thus, our estimates
of the average access gains for the un-
insured may overstate the average ac-
cess gains across all CHIP enrollees.
Several other considerations may also
result in bias in our estimates of the ac-
cess gains for the uninsured who en-
roll in CHIP. First, if those who choose
to participate in CHIP differ from those
who remain uninsured in ways that af-
fect health care use, then our esti-
mates of the access gains when the en-
tire population of uninsured is enrolled
in a public program may be a biased es-
timate of the access gains in CHIP. We
compared the demographic and health
characteristics of sample persons be-
low the poverty level who were unin-
sured and those on Medicaid to see
whether there is evidence that these cor-
relate with participation in public pro-
grams. Except for age differences, which
reflect the Medicaid eligibility expan-
sions for young children, we did not
observe differences between those who
did and did not participate in public
programs.
Second, our estimates of the access
gains were based on comparing cur-
rent use by the Medicaid population
with similar individuals in the unin-
sured population. However, the Med-
icaid population is also a self-selected
population. We controlled for self-
selection by including important deter-
minants of Medicaid eligibility for chil-
dren in our model--especially income
and the child's age. We also controlled
forself-reportedhealthstatusinouresti-
mation and excluded the Supplemen-
tal Security Income population--
knowntobealesshealthypopulation--
from our estimation. However, there
maybeotherunmeasuredfactorsrelated
to Medicaid enrollment and to use of
servicesthatcouldleadtoselectionbias.
For example, those who are entitled to
Medicaid on the basis of medical need
are likely to have greater use than the
uninsuredwithotherwisesimilardemo-
graphic profiles. To test for selection
bias, we carried out our model estima-
tion using only sample members drawn
from the Medicaid program enroll-
mentlists.Thislistsampleincludedonly

tance or were enrolled in poverty-

trolled for enrollment related to health
status. For the 9 states in which Med-
icaid lists were used to select a part of
the sample, predicted average visits for
uninsured children if they had been
enrolled in Medicaid were 4.6 whether
using the model fit on the full sample
of Medicaid children or the restricted
sample.
These considerations suggest that our
estimates of access effects are unlikely
to be biased by selection into Medic-
aid or by selection into CHIP. None-
theless, there may be unmeasured

Clearly, participation in CHIP, the

tions of these for access gains are prime
topics for retrospective evaluations
years from now, once the programs are
fully implemented and data from be-
fore and after implementation become
available for analysis.
