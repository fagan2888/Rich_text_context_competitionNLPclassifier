ESTIMATING THE PRIVATE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF
SONS VERSUS DAUGHTERS IN INDIA
Daniel Rosenblum
ABSTRACT
In order to understand the economic incentives behind gender discrimination
in India, this paper provides the first estimates of the magnitude of the
economic benefits of having a son instead of a daughter. The study estimates
large gains from a first-born son to per capita income and expenditure,
household assets, and a reduction in the probability the household is below
the poverty line. Estimates show that a first-born son may provide economic
advantages through a reduction in total children born and also from an adult
son's labor supply contribution to his parents' household. The observed pattern
of incentives is also compared with observed patterns in sex selection as a test
of whether the relative economic value of first-born sons and daughters can
explain the prevalence of sex-selective abortion.

INTRODUCTION
As in many countries, India suffers from extensive discrimination against
women. At an extreme, this takes the form of substantially higher female
mortality rates than male mortality rates, as well as the increasing use
of sex-selective abortion to remove daughters from a household before
birth. To give a sense of the magnitude of the excess female mortality
problem, Daniel Rosenblum (2013) finds that the mortality rates for
children between 1 and 60 months of age is 5.8 percent for girls and 3.9
percent for boys. The problem is even more striking than the almost 2
percentage points difference in mortality rates would suggest because boys
are biologically weaker than girls. In developed countries, men have higher
mortality rates than women at all ages. That is, without discrimination, we
should observe higher male than female mortality rates.

Several recent papers have estimated the large number of female sex-
selective abortions in India. Prabhat Jha, Rajesh Kumar, Priya Vasa, Neeraj
Dhingra, Deva Thiruchelvam, and Rahim Moineddin (2006), Prabhat
Jha, Maya A. Kesler, Rajesh Kumar, Faujdar Ram, Usha Ram, Lukasz
Aleksandowicz, Diego G. Bassani, Shailaja Chandra, and Jayant K. Banthia
(2011), and Sonia R. Bhalotra and Tom Cochrane (2010) find consistent
estimates of close to 500,000 selective abortions per year in India ­
about 2 percent of annual pregnancies. Sex selection and excess female
mortality are prevalent enough to skew the sex ratio of men to women far
above the rates seen in developed countries and are a major concern for
policymakers.
Although it is not a new idea that discrimination against women occurs
for economic reasons, this article is the first to estimate the magnitude of
the private economic benefits of a son relative to a daughter in India. I
test these economic benefits using the plausibly exogenous sex outcome
of a first birth in India. If parents in India are not selectively aborting
their first pregnancies, then the average difference between economic
outcomes of households with a first-born boy and those with a first-born
girl is an unbiased estimate of the average effect of giving birth to a son
at the first pregnancy rather than a daughter. The overall goal of this
research is to determine how economic incentives cause discrimination.
Thus, I also investigate whether patterns in the relative value of sons can
plausibly explain the variation across India in the prevalence of sex-selective
abortion.
I estimate that having a first-born son instead of a daughter increases
per capita yearly income, per capita monthly expenditures, and household
assets, while reducing the probability that the household is below the
poverty line. The economic value of a son is likely different at higher
parities. And, in particular, the economic value of a son likely rises with
the number of previously born daughters and falls with the number of
previously born sons. Thus, one can think of the estimated economic
benefit of a son versus a daughter at the first parity as a lower bound on the
economic benefit of a son for a household with no previously born sons.
There are a number of hypothesized mechanisms for the benefits of sons
in India. Mary Elizabeth Shepherd (2008) summarizes several of these,
including greater men's participation in agriculture and in the labor force
in general, lower marriage costs for sons,1 and the cultural convention of
sons rather than daughters providing financial support in old age. There is
wide variation in cultural practices across India. For example, some groups
practice bride price rather than dowry, and some groups have a tradition
of matrilineal rather than patrilineal inheritance rights. I compare the
estimated net economic benefits of a son across regions to investigate some
of these cultural differences. What we call "economics" and what we call
"culture" are interrelated here. For example, the cultural conventions of
2
ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF SONS
joint households where sons live with their parents even after marriage and
daughters move sometimes a great distance to live with their in-laws could
be the reason for the strong relative economic value of sons. I take the
cultural context as given, and examine the economic value of sons within
this context.
Although the determination of the exact mechanisms that cause sons
to be valuable is outside the scope of this paper, I investigate two related
mechanisms by comparing the relative economic value of a first-born son
for younger and older parents. The first mechanism is the additional
household labor supplied by a son. I find that if older parents have a
first-born son, they have more workers in the household and are, thus,
significantly better off in terms of household income and wealth than
parents with a first-born daughter. The second mechanism is the effect of
a son on household composition. Parents with a first-born son have fewer
children on average, and this is one reason that parents are better off in
per capita terms when their son is young. Shelley Clark (2000) shows that
many parents in India follow son-preferring fertility-stopping rules, where
the birth of a daughter causes parents to have more children in the hopes
of having one or more sons. Although a first-born son causes fewer children
to be born, this son also increases the number of household members when
parents are older because a daughter leaves when married, and a son adds a
daughter-in-law and grandchildren to the household, which may decrease
the economic benefits of a son in per capita terms. I compare different
equivalence scales to examine how these composition effects change the
interpretation of the estimates. Regardless of the equivalence scale, a first-
born son always has a positive average economic effect on the household
for some age groups and never has a negative effect.
In addition, I examine heterogeneity in the benefits of a son relative to a
daughter across regions and demographic groups. I use these estimates to
examine whether patterns in economic incentives can help to explain the
observed variation in sex selection across Indian regions and demographic
groups. Last, I focus on economic differences between households with
a second-born son compared to a second-born daughter, conditional on
the sex of the first-born child. I find that a second-born son provides no
economic benefit if the first-born child is male. This finding of diminishing
returns to sons helps to explain why parents do not sex select at the first
parity and why there is no demographic evidence in India of sex selection
occurring conditional on the birth of a previously born son.
BACKGROUND
Many researchers have found bias against girls in South Asia (Pravin
M. Visaria 1969; Alaka Malwade Basu 1989; Amartya Sen 1990; Ansley
Coale 1991; Stephan Klasen 1994; Gautam Hazarika 2000; Abay Asfaw,

ARTICLE
Francesca Lamanna, and Stephen Klasen 2010; Siwan Anderson and Debraj
Ray 2010). There are fewer attempts to determine or measure the specific
economic incentives causing this discrimination. Rosenblum (2013), for
example, hypothesizes that the future economic benefits of sons and costs
of daughters drive son-preferring fertility-stopping rules that exacerbate
discrimination against girls. Mark R. Rosenzweig and T. Paul Schultz (1982)
argue that the relatively high future wages of sons cause parents to invest
in sons over daughters in India. They explain part of the excess female
mortality in India by these wage differences. More recently, Eliana Carranza
(2014) shows that increased women's employment in agriculture in India
reduces the male­female sex ratio.
Overall, however, the economic causes of son preference and sex-
selective abortion in India have not been deeply explored. This article's
main contribution to the existing literature on gender discrimination
in India is that it is the first to estimate the extent to which a son
improves the household economy relative to a daughter. These estimates
provide empirical evidence to support a plausible economic explanation
for the missing women phenomenon in India and support some of the
hypothesized mechanisms for the economic value of sons. In addition, the
estimates show which subgroups have the most to gain from a son and, thus,
where sex selection or discrimination against daughters is likely to occur.
DATA DESCRIPTION
I use the detailed economic data from the 2005 India Human Development
Survey (IHDS). The data are nationally representative of India and cover
41,554 households in 1,504 villages and 970 urban neighborhoods in thirty-
three states and union territories. The IHDS contains data on household
spending, income, labor supply, and assets as well as demographic
characteristics such as household members' age, education, caste, and
religion. Ever-married women between the ages of 15 and 49 are asked
additional questions, and in particular are asked to report their full birth
history. Of these, 31,062 women report having one or more children.
However, to simplify the analysis, I only use the birth histories of heads
of household or their spouse and not, for example, of daughters-in-law.
Some households are dropped from the analysis if the head of household
has no children, birth history was not recorded, the head of household
has multiple wives, or the head of household has first-born twins, bringing
the sample size down to 24,158 households. Although the IHDS is a cross-
section, the detailed economic data make it more informative than, for
example, the multiple waves of the Indian National Family Health Surveys
(NFHS), which only contain a household wealth index.2
One may worry that the missing birth histories create bias because they
are of women who used selective abortion. Most of the birth histories
4
ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF SONS
dropped from the analysis are daughters-in-law living with the household
head. Analyzing them is complicated by the many households with more
than one daughter-in-law, making it difficult to match children to their
mother and to attribute the effects of the sex of a first-born child. However,
to address the possibility of such bias, I perform several tests that show that
parents of first-born sons are not initially different, and in particular not
wealthier, than parents of first-born daughters.
ESTIMATION STRATEGY
The estimation strategy uses the observation that the sex outcome of a
first birth in India is a random event. As shown in Bhalotra and Cochrane
(2010), Jha et al. (2011), Claus C. Portner (2015), and Rosenblum (2013),
in India, first births have a biologically normal sex ratio ­ that is, parents do
not use sex-selective abortion for their first pregnancies. Given the large
amount of evidence that sex selection is not influencing the first birth
parity, we can treat a first birth as a natural experiment where parents are
randomly giving birth to a son or a daughter. Thus, the following equation
estimates the private effect on the household economy of having a son
instead of a daughter at the first parity:
Yij
=  + FirstBoyij
+  Xij
+ Sj
+ eij (1)
where Yij is the economic variable of interest for household i in
state/territory j. FirstBoyij is a 0/1 variable equal to 1 if parents have a first-
born boy and equal to 0 if parents have a first-born girl. Xij is a vector of
household variables, including parents' age at the time of the survey, years
of schooling, religion, caste, and whether the household is in a rural or
urban part of India. Sj are state/territory fixed effects, and eij is the error
term.  is the estimated economic value of a first-born son compared with
a first-born daughter. Since the data is a cross-section, I can only measure
the 2005 relative value of a son and not how that value changes over time
for a specific household. However, a subanalysis focusing on different age
categories of parents gives an indication of how the economic benefits of
having a son change as parents age.
I estimate the economic benefits of a first-born son over four measures
of economic well-being: the (natural) log of per capita yearly income (PCI)
in Indian rupees, log of per capita monthly expenditure (PCE) in Indian
rupees, as well as a household asset index, and whether the household is
below or above the poverty line. There is a strong economic argument
for using household expenditure as a measure of long-term household
welfare (Angus Deaton 1997).3 I include income as well, even though it
may represent a more short-term measure of welfare in addition to having
potentially more difficult measurement problems. I also use per capita
5
ARTICLE
instead of total income or expenditure to help to account for differences
in household composition (Gautam Datta and Jacob Meerman 1980). Per
capita measures ignore potential economies of scale in the household.4
Because having a son affects household size via son-preferring fertility-
stopping rules, I investigate how different household equivalence scales
affect the interpretation of the estimates. Due to data limitations I cannot
account for all forms of private economic benefits derived from children.
Many household-produced services, while mainly produced by women, lack
market prices and thus are likely to go unaccounted for in household
income or expenditure aggregates (for example, childcare, elder care,
cooking, and cleaning). Thus, women's contributions to the household
economy are likely to be underestimated.
The IHDS household asset index is based on the household's ownership
of durable items (vehicle, sewing machine, computer, and so on) and
the quality of the home (flush toilet, quality of the walls, roof, and floor,
electricity, and so on). The index ranges from 0 to 30, with 30 indicating
the highest level of assets. The asset measure can be thought of as a measure
of household wealth. As Deon Filmer and Lant H. Pritchett (2001) argue,
an asset index can also be interpreted as a long-term measure of household
welfare. Last, I estimate the effect of a first-born son on poverty status. The
poverty line is determined by the Indian Planning Commission's official
per capita expenditure poverty lines for 2005, which varies by location.
EXOGENEITY OF THE SEX OF FIRST-BORN CHILDREN
If parents of first-born boys in the IHDS were systematically different than
households with a first-born girl in unobservable ways prior to having their
first child, it would be a threat to the empirical strategy. The population
weighted ratio of male to female first births in the IHDS is 1.09, with a
95 percent confidence interval of 1.05­1.13. This 1.09 is larger than the
1.03­1.07 range considered biologically normal (Anderson and Ray 2010).
However, even with more than 24,000 observations, the sample size is too
small to reject the hypothesis that the sex ratio at birth is normal.5 The
larger data sets used in previous studies find that the sex ratio at birth for
first-borns is biologically normal in India (Bhalotra and Cochrane 2010; Jha
et al. 2011; Portner 2015; Rosenblum 2013). However, I provide additional
evidence to ensure that there is no bias from sex selection at the first parity
in the IHDS.
One test to detect such a bias is to estimate whether first-born boy and
first-born girl households are systematically different in characteristics that
should be exogenous to the sex of their first-born child. Table 1 presents
population-weighted means for IHDS household variables separated into
male and female first-birth households. These variables include parents'
age and education, religion, caste, and whether they live in a rural or urban

area. There are almost no statistically significant differences between first-
born boy and first-born girl households.6 This table shows that if there is
bias in the dataset, it is likely small.
If, as Bhalotra and Cochrane (2010) show, wealthier households are
more likely to use sex selection, and parents use sex selection at the first
parity, then it would not be surprising if I find that a first-born boy predicts
better economic outcomes. For parents of older children, it is impossible to
disentangle this selection bias from the true increase in wealth generated
by a son. However, ultrasound only started to become prevalent in the
1990s and, hence, older parents were much less likely to have access to sex-
detection technology than younger parents. For parents of young children,
if the sex of a first-born is truly exogenous, then sons should have no effect
on wealth, which takes time to accumulate.
I test for the existence of this selection bias in young households in two
ways. First, focusing on households where the first-born is age 5 or under,
I examine whether there are significant differences in the sex ratio of first-
borns for wealthy versus poor households. Because of the limited sample
size, I only test the difference between households above the median
household asset index and those below. The survey-weighted proportion of
young wealthier households with a first-born son is 0.520 (standard error
0.018), while it is 0.528 (standard error 0.020) for households with low
assets. Hence, there is no detectable difference in the probability of giving
birth to a first-born son based on initial wealth.
Second, I estimate the effect of a first-born son on household assets
and poverty status using Equation 1, again only for parents of children
age 5 years or younger. As shown in Table 2, I find no statistically
significant difference between the two types of young parents, providing
additional evidence that households who have a first-born boy are not
initially wealthier than households with a first-born girl.
Although it is unlikely that sex selection occurs at the first parity, an
additional problem with the estimation strategy, as indicated in Rosenblum
(2013) and Annamaria Milazzo (2014), is that there is the potential for
recall and survival bias in the data that causes first-born girl households
to appear better off than they really are. Recall bias occurs when parents
do not accurately report their birth history. In particular, parents may
fail to report daughters who died when very young. Survival bias happens
because mothers of first-born daughters have more children on average
than mothers of first-born sons. Since death during childbirth is not
uncommon in India, this difference in number of children means that
mothers of first-born girls are more likely to die than mothers of first-
born boys and, therefore, are not available to be surveyed. In either case,
the worst-off mothers of first-born girls are those not being surveyed or
wrongly reporting that their first-born child is a son. Thus,  may be
an underestimate of the true economic benefits of having a first-born

son instead of a first-born daughter. Household demographic variables
are included in the estimations to reduce this bias. However, there is
little change to the coefficients if demographic controls are omitted. This
provides further evidence that there is little bias in the estimates and that
the sex of a first-born can reasonably be treated as exogenous.
AVERAGE ECONOMIC GAINS FROM A FIRST-BORN SON
On average, households with a first-born boy have better economic
outcomes than first-born girl households. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 1
show the mean dependent variables of interest with the sample separated by
the sex of the first-born child. The average household in the IHDS is very
poor, with per capita income of Rs. 9,700 annually,7 per capita monthly
expenditures of Rs. 840,8 and 22 percent of households living below the
poverty line. These numbers indicate the intense poverty of many of the
households in the survey as well as the potential for large increases in
household welfare from small increases in income or wealth.
The full estimation results indicate a strong positive effect on the
household economy of having a son instead of a daughter. Columns 1 and
2 in Tables 3­6 show estimates of the average economic difference across
India of a household with a first-born son versus first-born daughter. As
seen in column 2, where controls are added to reduce bias, a first-born son
increases annual per capita household income on average by 6.9 percent
across India, increases monthly household per capita expenditure by 2.1
percent, increases the household asset index by 0.2, and decreases the
probability that a household is in poverty by 0.7 percentage points. The
estimates for income, expenditure, and assets are statistically significant
at the 1 percent level. The estimates for below poverty line status are

significant at the 10 percent level. These findings show that there are
substantial economic gains from a son.
HOUSEHOLD SIZE, ECONOMIES OF SCALE, AND HOUSEHOLD
LABOR SUPPLY
Because many parents in India follow son-preferring fertility-stopping rules,
parents who have a first-born son will have fewer children on average.9
This may be the reason that per capita income and expenditure are larger
for these households. In India joint households are prevalent, and it is
common for sons to live with their parents after marriage, while daughters
live with their in-laws after marriage. Hence, older parents of sons gain
household members, while parents of daughters lose household members,
possibly causing per capita income and expenditure to fall for older
parents of first-born sons.10 If household economies of scale are important,
then household demographic changes may cause per capita measures to
overestimate the effect of a first-born son on the household economy when
children are young and underestimate the effect when children are old.
Wealthy households may wait longer to have a child than poor
households. Thus, the relative age of a child to his parents may
be endogenous to economic outcomes. However, the mother's age is
exogenous to household economic outcomes; that is, economic outcomes
cannot affect a mother's current age. Therefore, I use age of the mother
rather than age of the first-born to investigate changes to demographic
structure. The sample is stratified by the mother's age (under 30, between
30 and 35, between 35 and 40, between 35 and 40, and above 45) to test
the effect of a male first-born on household composition. Since the data
is a cross-section, the differences in the effects of a first-born son on the
household economy for younger versus older households cannot tell us
what will happen to currently younger households or what happened in the
past to currently older households. For example, given the rapid decline in
fertility in India, we should expect the future effect of a son on household
composition to be weaker. Nonetheless, the estimates are the best we can do
with the current data limitations to determine how a first-born son affects
the household economy at various life stages.
To give a better sense of the demographic make-up of the household for
each mother age category, the mean age of first-born children is shown in
Table 7, column (1). The mother age categories also indicate the marital
status of children. Less than 1 percent of sons are married below the age of
13. Four percent are married between the ages of 13 and 20; 34 percent are
married between the ages of 21 and 25. Only the marital status of current
household members is observed in the IHDS. Thus, a daughter's marriage
status is generally not observed because they usually leave the household
after marriage. For example, less than 1 percent of daughters living in their

Robust standard errors are clustered by state in parentheses for all regression estimates. All
regressions include the following independent variables: parents' age and education, caste/religion,
urban/rural and state. Column 1 presents the mean age of first-born children within each mother
age category. Columns 2­7 show the estimated effect of having a first-born son on the total number
of children, teens, adults, workers, total household members, and the dependency ratio (the number
of household members under age 15 and over age 64 divided by the number of household members
aged 15 through 64). "Total" is the number of children plus teens plus adults. "Workers" are the
number of household members that have worked at least 240 hours per year.
parents' household are married under the age of 20, and only 6 percent
are married between the ages of 21 and 25.
Table 7 shows the effect of a first-born son on the number of children
(ages 0­14) in column 2, number of adolescents and young adults (15­
21) in column 3, number of mature adults (21+ ) in column 4, number
of workers in the household in column 5, total household members in
column 6, and the dependency ratio in column 7. As predicted, a first-born
son reduces the total number of household members when parents are
young and raises it when they are old. Furthermore, a first-born reduces
a household's dependency ratio across age categories. These effects on the
household demographic composition are due to a reduction in the number
of children for younger mothers and an increase in the number of adults
(and workers) for older mothers.11

Figure 1 Estimated household expenditure benefits of a first-born son relative to a
first-born daughter for three levels of household economies of scales: per capita
expenditure (PCE), total expenditure/

household members), and total expenditure.
Notes: The sample is stratified by mother's age categories. See Online Appendix for

Column 3 in Tables 3­6 includes interaction terms between having a
first-born boy and the mother's age categories. They show that younger
households (mother's age 30­35) with a first-born boy are less likely to be
in poverty, while older households (ages 40 and older) have significantly
greater assets. It is the younger households that appear to gain the most
from a son in per capita income or expenditure.12 In order to better
understand the changes in the economic gains from a son as households
age, I stratify the sample by mother's age categories and compare the
effect of a first-born son on the log of per capita income and per capita
expenditure, the log of total income and total expenditure, and the
log of income/

N and expenditure/

N, where N is the total number
of household members. These measures represent both extremes of
equivalence scales, no economies of scale (per capita) versus full economies
of scale (total), and the in-between measure that is used as an equivalence
scale in most industrialized countries (total/

N ). The estimates of  for
the five mother age categories and three equivalence scales are shown in
Figures 1 and 2. See Online Appendix for a more thorough discussion of
equivalence scales and their corresponding estimates.
The figures show how per capita measures can underestimate the
economic gains from a first-born son for older parents and overestimate
them for younger parents. For per capita measures of economic well-
being, the benefits are the largest when mothers are in the 30­35 age
range, when households with a first-born boy have fewer children. For

total income or expenditure measures, the largest benefits accrue when the
mother is age 45 or older, when households with a first-born son have more
adults. In addition, these estimates provide insights into the two proposed
mechanisms for the economic benefits of sons. As indicated in Table 7,
column 5, in the long run, because of the joint household structure in
India, having a son instead of a daughter increases the number of workers
in the household when parents are older. Indeed, these households are
significantly better off in terms of total, if not per capita, income and
expenditure. In other words, these graphs illustrate that regardless of the
economies of scale, there are large economic benefits from a first-born son
at some age categories.
Table 5 shows that older mothers with a first-born son live in households
with significantly higher assets. These findings show that old-age support
is a significant economic reason to want a son in India. Thus, the short-
run mechanism for the economic value of sons is that they reduce desired
fertility, increasing expenditure and income per person. This is enough to
push some households above the poverty line. Having fewer children may
free up parents' labor, which would increase total and per capita income.
Or, as in the United States and West Germany, fathers of sons may increase
their labor supply simply because they have a son (Shelly Lundberg and
Elaina Rose 2002; Hyung-Jai Choi, Jutta M. Joesch, and Shelly Lundberg
21
ARTICLE
2008). The two mechanisms are interrelated in that parents' desire for
support in old age may cause parents to follow son-preferring fertility-
stopping rules in the first place.
HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS OF A FIRST-BORN SON: DO PATTERNS
IN THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF A SON MATCH PATTERNS IN
SEX-SELECTIVE ABORTION?
Different types of household likely benefit in different ways from having
sons, if they benefit at all. Columns 4­8 in Tables 3­6 include interaction
terms between having a first-born son and observable household
characteristics and location in order to understand the heterogeneous
effects of a son on the household economy. This section has two goals. First,
it provides policymakers with information on which population groups
have the largest economic benefits from a son and, hence, the strongest
incentives to use sex selection. Second, it informs us about whether
economic incentives can explain observations from prior research about
which subpopulations are using sex-selective abortion in India.
In particular, this section examines the following observations: (1)
Selective abortion happens more often among those with more years of
education (Jha et al. 2006; Sucharita Sinha Mukherjee 2013; Portner 2015);
(2) There are substantial regional differences in the extent of sex selection;
however, regional differences (in particular, north versus south India) in
the number of selective abortions disappear when demographic differences
are controlled for (Bhalotra and Cochrane 2010); (3) Selective abortion
does not occur for a given birth parity if there were any previously born
sons (Jha et al. 2006; Bhalotra and Cochrane 2010; Portner 2015). I also
include the heterogeneous economic benefits of a son for urban versus
rural households and for the various caste and religious groups of India.
Mother's education
I estimate Equation 1 with interactions between having a first-born son and
the mother's education groups used in Jha et al. (2006) (no education,
less than primary, primary below grade 10, and grade 10 or higher). These
estimates are presented in column 4 in Tables 3­6.13 The estimates using
these cutoffs do not exactly fit the pattern of the more educated using
sex selection. Per capita expenditure gains appear largest for the most
educated, but the pattern is not monotonic, with mothers with primary
education also having large relative gains. There is no detectable additional
benefit from a son based on the mother's education for assets, income, or
poverty status.
The broader cutoffs used by Portner (2015; above and below grade 8)
fit the pattern of sex selection, with more education associated with higher
22
ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF SONS
per capita expenditures (a 3 percent increase, statistically significant at the
5 percent level). However, in general there are large economic gains to
having a son, even for the less educated. Thus, the findings do not entirely
explain why, for example, Portner (2015) finds that less-educated parents
do not use sex-selective abortion. Perhaps it is a matter of access to sex-
detection technology. If this is the case, then the estimates would predict a
future rise in sex selection among those with less education as sex detection
becomes cheaper and more widespread.
Regional differences
In India there are large differences in the male­female sex ratio across
regions. In particular, richer north India has a higher male­female sex ratio
than poorer south India.14 Furthermore, there are substantial differences
in marriage practices and labor outcomes for women across India that
may affect the relative value of sons (Tim Dyson and Mick Moore 1983;
Bina Agarwal 1994). For example, in north India, exogamous marriage
is prevalent, while in south and northeast India, endogamous marriage
is more common. Up until a 2005 amendment to the Hindu Succession
Act, there were differences across India in Hindu women's legal rights to
inherit ancestral property across India, with most women unable to inherit.
A handful of states, mostly in south India, passed laws granting equal legal
inheritance rights for sons and daughters many years before this. Even
within states, there is variation in cultural practices. For example, although
dowry is prevalent in north India, the Girahya in south Rajasthan practice
bride price (Maya Unnithan-Kumar 1991).
That north India has more discrimination against girls may be because
north Indian households have larger economic gains from a son compared
to south Indian households. To test whether there is large variation in the
value of a son versus a daughter across India, the sample is split into six
subgroups: North, Central, West, East, South, and Northeast.15 If economic
incentives are causing selective abortion, then the gains from a son should
be larger in the areas with a high male­female sex ratio at birth. The
following estimation equation is used for the regional estimates:
Yik
=  + FirstBoyik
+ kFirstBoyik
 Rk
+ kRk
+  Xik
+ eik (2)
where the economic outcome for household i in region k depends on the
sex outcome of the first-birth, region fixed effects (Rk), region interacted
with the sex outcome of the first birth, and a vector of household
characteristics. The omitted region is the South.
Equation 2 is estimated with and without Xik, the vector of demographic
variables. Without these controls, the estimates show which states have
the largest incentives for sex selection on average. These are the relevant
23
ARTICLE
estimates for policymakers who want to target the places in India with the
largest incentives for sex selection. With the demographic control variables,
the estimates show whether the average incentives for sex selection in
a region can be explained by the particular demographic make-up of a
region. That is, we can test whether the region itself or characteristics
of those who live in the region explain the economic incentives for sex
selection.
The estimates are presented in columns 7 and 8 in Tables 3­6. In
column 7, without demographic controls, the North, East, Center, and West
generally show greater gains from a son compared to the South, while the
Northeast shows lower gains than the South. Using the estimated number
of sex-selective abortions in Jha et al. (2006), one can rank these regions by
the number of sex-selective abortions per pregnancy.16 The North has the
most sex-selective abortions, followed by the West, East, Center, South, and
then the Northeast with the smallest sex-selection problem.
In general, the coefficients show higher gains from a first-born son for
regions with more sex selection. The estimated effect size for Center is
statistically smaller than the East and West for PCI, and from the North
and East for poverty status. Only the Northeast and South's estimated
effects are consistently less than the other regions at a statistically significant
level. Although we cannot precisely determine the pattern in incentives
at the regional level, without demographic controls, there appear to be
stronger economic incentives for sex selection for the regions with high
levels of sex selection (the North, West, and East) than for those with
little sex selection (the South and Northeast). If household demographic
controls are added to the regional estimates, as shown in column 8,
the estimated differences across regions are generally reduced and less
statistically significant. However, the effects do not disappear when controls
are added and do not always decline (the effect on poverty status gets
stronger for north India when controls are added). These mixed results
indicate that regional incentives to have sons go beyond demographic
differences and that there are regional cultural differences that affect the
private economic value of sons and daughters. In the Online Appendix,
the estimates are further broken down by individual states to illustrate
the complexity of the relative value of sons and daughters across India.
Although patterns in the estimated effect of a first-born son on the
household economy are generally consistent across states within a region,
there are several states that differ significantly from one another, even
within regions.
Other heterogeneous effects: Urban/rural and caste/religion
Portner (2015) shows that sex selection has spread to both urban and rural
areas of India. In accord with these findings, there is little difference in
24
ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF SONS
the economic benefits of a first-born son between urban and rural parts of
India (column 5, Tables 3­6). In addition, estimates including interactions
with caste and religion in column 6 do not appear to have an effect on
the economic values of sons. There is a large positive effect of a first-born
son on assets for Christian households and a lower likelihood of being
in poverty for Other Backwards Classes. However, there are no consistent
benefits of a son across economic variables for any particular subgroups.
This lack of evidence may simply be due to the small sample size of any
single caste or religion.
Diminishing returns to sons
Although fertility decisions can be influenced by economic outcomes, most
parents in India eventually have two or more children.17 As indicated by
Jha et al. (2006), Portner (2015), and Bhalotra and Cochrane (2010), sex-
selective abortion is only likely to occur among second pregnancies if the
first child is a daughter.18 Assuming that the sex of the second-born child
is unaffected by the household economy conditional on having a first-born
son, we can test whether having an additional son has any effect on the
household economy. Table 8 shows the OLS estimates for the value of this
second son. There are no statistically significant economic benefits from
having a second son, indicating diminishing returns to sons.
The estimates for the effect of a second-born son conditional on a
household having a first-born daughter are also presented in Table 8.
The economic gains from a second-born son are similar to those found in
Table 8 OLS: Effect of a son at the second parity on the household economy

Tables 3­6. With the presence of sex selection for this group, it is difficult
to make anything conclusive of these effects, since they could be coming
from a selected sample of richer households using sex-selective abortion.
However, if this bias is small, the estimates indicate that there are strong
economic incentives for sex selection at the second parity, conditional on
a first-born daughter. These results suggest that having two boys, or a boy
and girl (in any order), have similar effects on the household economy.
Thus, these findings help to explain the observation that parents do not
use sex-selective abortion in India if they already have one son, and that sex
selection does not occur at the first parity even though a first-born son has
a substantial positive effect on the household economy.
CONCLUSION
These estimates paint a multihued picture of the economic gains from a
son in India. A first-born son improves the household economy in several
different ways depending on the type and age of the household. Some
households gain income, while others gain assets. Some types of household
are pushed out of poverty, but others are unaffected. That almost all of
the statistically significant results show positive gains from a son indicates
the general robustness of the finding that a son creates a large economic
gain for a household. In addition, the economic benefits of a son coincide
with observed patterns of sex selection in India. Thus, economic incentives
provide a plausible explanation for the prevalence of sex-selective abortion
in India. Furthermore, policymakers can use these findings to inform
policies that aim to reduce the economic incentives for sex selection.
This article explores two of the possible mechanisms that create the
economic benefits of a first-born son. In the short run, a first-born son
reduces the number of children in the household increasing the amount
of resources available per person. The increase in household labor supply
provided by an adult son is a likely mechanism for the economic benefits
of a son in the long run. There are no doubt other possible mechanisms
that may explain the economic incentives, such as dowry and the lack of
opportunities for women's employment.
The estimates show that there are strong economic incentives for sex
selection even in groups that have not recently been using sex-selective
abortion. Recent estimates show that selective abortion is still on the rise
in India (Stephan Klasen and Claudia Wink 2003), although it is starting
to decline in northern India, where the sex ratios are already very high
(Monica Das Gupta, Woojin Chung, and Li Shuzhuo 2009; Jha et al.
2011). This should serve as a warning to policymakers that as access to sex
detection and abortion improves, the strong economic pressures to have a
son will increase the prevalence of sex-selective abortion.
26
ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF SONS
While this article estimates the private returns to parents of having a son
versus a daughter, it does not measure the positive externalities of having
a daughter. At the household level, sisters may improve the outcomes of
their siblings (William L. Parish and Robert J. Willis 1993; Ashish Garg and
Jonathan Morduch 1998). At an aggregate level, there are potentially huge
costs of having an extremely skewed sex ratio. Not only will there be tens
of millions of men unable to marry, but these men could cause large-scale
crime and security problems (Valerie M. Hudson and Andrea M. Den Boer
2004; Lena Edlund, Hongbin Li, Junjian Yi, and Junsen Zhang 2013).
For policymakers, this article suggests that eliminating discrimination
that favors sons and hurts daughters may be an expensive and difficult
task. However, any marginal increase in the benefit of a daughter relative
to a son may help to internalize the aforementioned positive externalities
of daughters, which would decrease the use of sex-selective abortion
and reduce excess female mortality. Such policy interventions could
take the form of conditional or unconditional cash transfers for parents
of daughters, subsidized schooling and healthcare for daughters, and
improving women's property and labor rights.

ARTICLE
NOTES
1 In India, it is common for the bride's parents to transfer assets to the groom and his
parents at the time of marriage. Vijayendra Rao (1993) and Siwan Anderson (2003)
show that dowries can be substantial costs to the parents of daughters.
2 As in the IHDS, a separate analysis using the NFHS estimates that a first-born boy
predicts greater wealth in households (estimates not reported). They also follow the
same age pattern as assets in the IHDS: a first-born boy is correlated with more wealth
for older parents, but not for younger parents.
3 Total household monthly expenditure is calculated using the detailed expenditure
data in the IHDS survey. Survey respondents are asked about many categories of food
expenses, such as rice, wheat, sugar, and meat. Food expenditures are calculated by
the quantity and price paid (including purchases from ration shops) or by the amount
grown and consumed using the market price. Respondents are also asked about
many other monthly expenses such as paan, tobacco and intoxicants, fuel and light,
entertainment, school fees, and medical expenses. The total monthly expenditure is
the sum of all of these monthly expenses. See the IHDS household questionnaire for
descriptions of each expenditure category.
4 See Deaton (1997) for a discussion of the various problems of calculating per capita
equivalents.
5 The reason that a large sample size is needed to accurately estimate proportions can
be seen from the formula to calculate 95 percent confidence intervals:
p ± 1.96
p(1 - p)
n
where p is the estimated proportion, and n is the number of observations. Assuming
the estimated proportion was exactly 1.05 males per female (or 51.2 percent
male births), one would need more than 40,000 observations to get a 95 percent
confidence interval within the 1.03­1.07 range. If the estimated proportion were
exactly 1.06 males per female, one would need more than 170,000 observations to
get a 95 percent confidence interval within the 1.05­1.07 range. The closer the actual
estimated proportion is to 1.07, the more observations are needed to distinguish the
estimated proportion from being above 1.07.
6 The one exception is self-identified Muslim households, where first-born boy
households are 13 percent Muslim, and first-born girl households are 11 percent
Muslim. One possibility is that Muslim households are using sex-selective abortion
for first pregnancies. However, since Muslim households are on average poorer than
non-Muslim households, it is unlikely that this would introduce much bias into the
estimates. All of the estimates in the paper are robust to dropping Muslim households
from the sample. Given the large number of variables, it is also likely that this
exception represents a type I error.

9 As in Rosenblum (2013), a first-born son predicts fewer total children born (about
2/5 of a child fewer in the IHDS data for mothers age 35 and older).
10 For example, a household with one son will start out with three family members
(mother, father, son); then increase to four, with the addition of the son's wife; and
then continue to increase as the son has children. By contrast, two parents with four
daughters will start off with six household members, but then shrink to two as all the
daughters get married and join different households.
11 Analysis of the components of household income and labor show that a first-born son
predicts more sons working in the household, rather than daughters-in-law or other
28
ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF SONS
types of household member. A first-born son also predicts having more household
income from nonparent sources.
12 Although I do not include these estimates in the article, separate tests of the effects
of a first-born son on adult expenses per adult (paan/tobacco/intoxicants) and child
expenses per school-age child (school fees and school books) help to illuminate what
the expenses are used for. There is no statistically significant effect of a first-born son
on adult expenditures. However, there is a statistically significant increase in child
expenditures of about 7 percent, which shows that some of the improvement in the
household economy is being invested in children. Perhaps younger households invest
in human capital rather than physical assets with the birth of a first-born son.
13 The estimates are similar if the father's education level is used. If the sample only
includes mothers (or fathers) with post-secondary education, there is no statistically
significant economic benefit of having a first-born son. This finding is in accord
with Douglas Almond, Lena Edlund, and Kevin Milligin (2013), who find that sex
selection occurs among Asian immigrants to Canada, even though they likely have
small economic incentives to do so.
14 2005/6 state per capita GDP averaged across north India (Delhi, Haryana, Himachal
Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Uttarakhand) is Rs. 40,000 compared to per capita
GDP over all of India of Rs. 30,000 and Rs. 32,000 in south India (Andhra Pradesh,
Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu).
15 North: Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Chandigarh, Uttaranchal,
Haryana, Delhi, and Rajasthan. Center: Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. West:

Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Meghalaya and
Assam. Note: the small territories Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and
Pondicherry are dropped from the regional analysis.
16 Since Jha et al. (2006) do not include all states, I rank using the following states:
North: Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan. Center: Uttar Pradesh
and Madhya Pradesh. West: Gujarat and Maharashtra. East: Bihar, Orissa, and West
Bengal. South: Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. Northeast:
Assam.
17 In the IHDS, 94 percent of mothers age 35 and older have two or more children.
18 In the IHDS, the male­female sex ratio at birth for second-borns conditional on
having a first-born male (1.02) is lower than the sex ratio conditional on having a
first-born female (1.08). Due to the sample size of the IHDS, they are not statistically
different.
