Abstract
Objective: To compare the serum mean platelet volume (MPV) in patients with testicular torsion
and healthy control subjects.
Methods: This retrospective study compared clinical and demographic data from patients who
underwent surgery for testicular torsion and healthy controls. Testicular torsion was diagnosed
with a physical examination and Doppler ultrasonography. Age, leukocyte count, platelet count and
MPV were recorded for all participants.
Results: A total of 50 patients with testicular torsion and 51 healthy control subjects were
enrolled. There was no significant difference in age and platelet count between the two groups.
Patients with testicular torsion had a significantly higher leukocyte count and MPV, compared with
controls. According to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis performed for the
prediction of testicular torsion, the best cut-off point for MPV was 7.7 fl (sensitivity 62%,
specificity 96%), and the best cut-off point for leukocyte count was 9.5 Â 109/l (sensitivity 58%,
specificity 80%).
Conclusions: The MPV may be useful as an ancillary test for the diagnosis of testicular torsion.
Further studies are needed in order to confirm these preliminary results.

Introduction
Testicular torsion is a clinical condition that is
characterized by reduced testicular blood
flow as a result of twisting of the spermatic
cord around its own axis. Twisting of the
spermatic cord is followed by testicular
venous occlusion, congestion, and, ultim-
ately, arterial ischaemia and testicular infarc-
tion.1 Testicular torsion is more common in
males aged <25 years;1 affected patients
typically present with testicular tenderness
and pain. Testicular torsion should be differ-
entiated from other conditions that feature
acute scrotal pain including epididymo-orchi-
tis and appendicitis.2 Differentiation can be
achieved by imaging modalities such as scro-
tal Doppler ultrasonography and scintig-
raphy. The use of laboratory parameters
(e.g. leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimenta-
tion rate, and alkaline phosphatase, creatine
kinase and C-reactive protein measurement)
has been investigated in the diagnosis of
testicular torsion and acute scrotum.3
Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a marker
of platelet activation.4 Although routinely
analysed along with other indices of the
complete blood count (CBC), the MPV is
often overlooked by clinicians. Research has
suggested the usefulness of MPV in the
diagnostic processes of various inflamma-
tory and/or vascular disorders.4,5 This cur-
rent retrospective study aimed to investigate
whether the MPV value, and the leukocyte
and platelet counts, could be used for
diagnosing testicular torsion.
Patients and methods
Patient population
This study retrospectively reviewed the
medical records of patients with acute scrotal
pain, who presented to the Department of
Urology and the Department of Emergency
Medicine, Medical and Research Centre,
Baskent University, Konya, Turkey and the
Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine,
Baskent University, Ankara, Turkey, between
February 2005 and December 2013. Patients
diagnosed with testicular torsion underwent
orchiectomy and/or surgical detorsion and
bilateral testicular fixation. Exclusion criteria
included manual detorsion followed by
surgery on an elective basis at a later date,
myeloproliferative disorders, leukaemia,
and Bernard­Soulier Syndrome. A control
group included healthy male volunteers
selected from individuals who attended
the Department of Infectious Diseases and
Clinical Microbiology, Medical and Research
Centre, Baskent University, Konya, Turkey
for an outpatient appointment. The control
subjects had no epididymo-orchitis, testicular
trauma, testicular tumour, previous scrotal
surgery, or abnormal renal or hepatic function
tests. Demographic features and findings of a
preoperative CBC (which included leukocyte
count, platelet count, and MPV) were rec-
orded for all participants. Age, leukocyte
count, platelet count, and MPV were com-
pared between the two groups.
Consent was not required from the Ethics
Committee of Baskent University, Ankara,
Turkey because of the retrospective nature of
this study. Written informed consent was
routinely obtained from each surgical patient.
Verbal informed consent was obtained from
all subjects in the control group.
Laboratory measurements
Peripheral venous blood samples (3 ml)
were collected into tubes containing 5.4 mg
ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid, and a
rapid laboratory analysis was applied to
each sample. An electronic cell counter
(CELL-DYNÕ 3700; Abbott Laboratories,
Abbott Park, IL, USA) was used to measure
the CBC. At Baskent University,
the expected MPV range was 7.0­12.0
fl, the expected leukocyte count was
4.5­11.0 Â 109/l and the expected platelet
count was 150­400 Â 109/l.

Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed
using the SPSSÕ statistical package, version
19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Data were expressed as
meanÆ SD. Student's t-test was used for con-
tinuous variables. The leukocyte and platelet
counts and the MPV were not normally
distributed and thus were compared with the
nonparametric Mann­Whitney U-test across
thetwostudygroups.Thecorrelationbetween
the MPV and the othervariables was analysed
using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve analysis was used to deter-
mine the relationship between testicular tor-
sion and MPV and leukocyte count.
Results
This study retrospectively reviewed the med-
ical records of 350 male participants. A total
of 53 patients were diagnosed with testicular
torsion. Three patients underwent manual
detorsion and under went elective surgery at
a later date, so were excluded from the
study. Fifty patients underwent orchiectomy
and/or surgical detorsion and bilateral tes-
ticular fixation for testis torsion (testicular
torsion group). Fifty-one healthy volunteers
formed the control group. Clinical and
demographic characteristics of study par-
ticipants are presented Table 1. The mean
leukocyte count was significantly higher in
the testicular torsion group compared with
the control group (P ¼ 0.005). The mean
MPV was significantly higher in the testicu-
lar torsion group compared with the control
group (P < 0.001). There were no significant
differences in mean age and platelet counts
between the two groups.
According to the ROC curve analysis
performed for the prediction of testicular
torsion, the best cut-off point for the leuko-
cyte count was 9.5 Â 109/l (sensitivity 58%,
specificity 80%, area under curve [AUC]:
0.7) (Figure 1). The same analysis showed
that the best cut-off point for MPV was 7.7 fl
(sensitivity 62%, specificity 96%, AUC: 0.8)
(Figure 1). MPV was significantly correlated
with leukocyte count (P ¼ 0.0001), but not
with platelet count (Table 2).
Discussion
Measuring the CBC is a frequently used,
rapid and inexpensive way of providing
valuable information with regard to the
diagnosis and follow-up of various dis-
orders. Urologists frequently use CBC for
determining inflammatory pathologies and
for undertaking routine preoperative

gery. Along with providing leukocyte, neu-
trophil and platelet counts, haemoglobin
concentration and haematocrit levels, the
CBC also includes some parameters that are
often overlooked, such as MPV and red cell
distribution width. In common urological
practice, leukocyte count is frequently used
for assessing complicated urinary tract
infections.6,7 Leukocytes are immune-
system cells that are involved in protecting
the body against infectious disease and

also been reported to be increased in tes-
ticular torsion.9 An increased leucocyte
count as a result of torsion in the cremasteric
muscle tissue surrounding testicular tissue
has been reported in Wistar rats; this
increase worsened hypoxia, reduced micro-
perfusion and lowered the number of func-
tional capillary vessels.10 The current study
similarly observed that the leukocyte count
was significantly higher in patients with
testicular torsion when compared with the
control group.
Mean platelet volume is a parameter that
provides information about the functional
status of platelets. Assessing platelet volume
and structure is helpful in diagnosing vari-
ous blood disorders such as idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura and myeloproli-
ferative diseases.11,12 Larger platelets are
both metabolically and enzymatically more
active than other platelets and have a greater
thrombotic potential due to their contents
(i.e. thromboxane A2, P-selectin, and glyco-
protein IIb/IIIa).13 Elevated MPV values
often indicate accelerated and increased
production of young platelets (i.e. megakar-
yocytes), with a resulting disproportionate
increase in the number of large hypercoagul-
able platelets.14 Activated platelets also
release antibacterial peptides.15 According
to some evidence, however, certain patho-
gens may have become able to exploit
activated platelets and thus to establish or
propagate infection by binding to platelet
surfaces.16 In addition, studies have
reported some changes in MPV values in
certain noninfectious inflammatory
processes, possibly suggesting a role for
MPV in reflecting the activity of certain
inflammatory disorders.17­19
There is only one study in the published
literature that specifically sought to investi-
gate the relationship between testicular
torsion and platelet count, clotting factors,
and platelet activating factors.20 This experi-
mental study reported that platelet
activation had a role in testicular ischaemia
because ischaemia-related damage was
reduced by the administration of antiplatelet
activating factor.20 To our knowledge, no
previous study has examined the MPV in
testicular torsion. However, the MPV has
been reported to increase in urological
vascular pathologies such as varicocele and
erectile dysfunction.21,22 Furthermore, an
increase in the MPV has also been observed
in conditions like patent foramen ovale,
myocardial infarction, and cerebral infarc-
tion.23­25 Therefore, increased MPV values
have been considered a vascular risk factor.
This current study found no significant
difference between the two study groups
with respect to platelet count and there was
no correlation between MPV and platelet
count. In contrast, the MPV was signifi-
cantly higher in patients with testicular
torsion compared with the control group.
Testicular torsion is characterized by the
twisting of the spermatic cord around itself,
leading to intratesticular venous congestion
and interstitial oedema. This situation
causes compression in the testicular micro-
circulatory system (venous­arteriolar) and
alteration of the vascular diameter.26,27
Studies have shown that testicular venous
congestion causes formation of vascular
microthrombi that induce the intrinsic
coagulation pathway.27,28 Furthermore,
hypoxia has been shown to increase
the formation of microthrombi and produc-
tion of endothelin-1.29,30 Endothelin-1 is a
vasoconstricting factor that acts via
endothelin-A receptors.30 The use of a
selective endothelin-A antagonist during
the reperfusion period improved the micro-
circulatory inflammatory reactions and
caused an earlier return of pulsatile blood
flow in rats.30 These published findings
suggest that the MPV is elevated in testicular
torsion because this condition causes vascu-
lar pathology. 26­28
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and
C-reactive protein, which are acute-phase
456 Journal of International Medical Research 43(3)
markers, have been shown to be elevated
during the clinical examination leading to a
diagnosis of testicular torsion.3,31 The MPV
was shown to be significantly higher in
patients with acute pancreatitis compared
with control subjects,32 but a significantly
lower MPV was detected in paediatric
patients with acute appendicitis.33 This
current study found a positive correlation
between the MPV and leukocyte count, and
the MPV had a greater specificity than the
leukocyte count for diagnosing testicular
torsion. These current findings suggest that
the MPV may have been elevated as an
acute-phase reactant. The sensitivity of the
MPV to diagnose testicular torsion was low
(62%) in the present study. To our know-
ledge, no previous study has examined
MPV values in testicular torsion, so it is
not possible to compare the present findings
with those of other studies.
This current study had a number of
limitations. First, it had a retrospective
design. Secondly, it only had a small
sample size. Thirdly, the control group
consisted of healthy men without epidi-
dymo-orchitis, but the patient population
included a low number of patients of similar
age with epididymo-orchitis who underwent
a complete blood count and scrotal Doppler
ultrasonography. For these reasons, it is
difficult to conclude how beneficial it might
be to use the MPV as a parameter when
excluding inflammatory and noninflamma-
tory causes of testicular torsion. Further
research in larger patients groups is
required.
In conclusion, although it had a low
sensitivity, the MPV may be a useful ancil-
lary marker for diagnosing testicular tor-
sion. Without further published reports on
the role of testicular MPV values in relation
to specific testicular inflammatory patholo-
gies, the MPV might be helpful but not
critical in the diagnosis of testicular torsion.
The causes of the MPV elevation in
testicular torsion should be more fully
investigated in future studies.
