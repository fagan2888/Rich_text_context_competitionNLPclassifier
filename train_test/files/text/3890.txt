Culture is a fundamental guide to all facets of a person's
life; it is symbolic, historic, and dynamic (Jones, 2003).
Kroeber and Kluckhohn's (1952) definition of culture
includes learned behaviors and ideas that are based on tra-
dition and their attached values which are socially transmit-
ted from one generation to the next. Culture is entwined in
a person's daily actions and is consequently a key factor in
the meaning of food and eating. This study will examine
the relationship between cultural orientation and eating
behaviors of African American men and women.
African American cultural attitudes
Jones (2003) posits that African American culture has a
unique worldview that reflects the attitudes, cognitions,
values, and behaviors of African American experiences in
five dimensions: time, rhythm, improvisation, orality, and
spirituality (TRIOS). TRIOS, as a theory, is a way to under-
stand the psychological and cultural resources that helped
Africans in America to survive and be resilient to racial
oppression and dehumanization (Jones, 2003, 2004).
These coping mechanisms became cultural patterns,
which in turn were passed onto the next generation of
African Americans. Jones (2003) has developed a scale
operationalizing the TRIOS dimensions, and African
Americans score significantly higher than, or as high as,
any other ethnic group on all five TRIOS dimensions in a
test of validity. High levels of TRIOS are associated with
greater psychological well-being in the African American
population (Jones, 2003). This broad and comprehensive
theory of cultural orientation for African Americans aids in
our understanding of African American eating behaviors.
The current research
There are several limitations in the extant literature on the
relationship between culture and eating among African
Americans. One limitation is that the majority of studies on
this topic have failed to examine how specific elements of
African American culture may be associated with eating
behaviors (Harris and Kuba, 1997; Lovejoy, 2001; Parker
et al., 1995; Rich and Thomas, 2008). The second limita-
tion is that research on African American culture and eating
behaviors is still lacking a comprehensive measure of

Abstract
Cultural groups often participate in traditions and activities surrounding food and eating, which contribute to group
differences in maladaptive eating-related patterns and outcomes. This study explored the relationships between cultural
attitudes and eating behaviors of young adult African American men and women. Endorsing a strong orientation on
various dimensions of African American culture were related to less dieting, bulimic, and anorexic behaviors and
attitudes. This study extended our knowledge of the ways in which cultural attitudes were related to the physical and
mental health of African Americans and recognized the significance of individual differences within this group.

cultural orientation (Henrickson et al., 2010). While it is
important to understand the relationship between eating
behaviors and other proxy measures such as racial and eth-
nic identity, these measures may discount the richness of
culture (Harris and Kuba, 1997). The final limitation is that
previous research on this topic has been mainly compara-
tive in nature. Comparative research fails to recognize and
explain individual personality differences within African
Americans.
This study addresses these limitations in the existing lit-
erature by investigating whether cultural orientation is
related to eating behaviors for African American men and
women. We are defining eating behaviors as dieting,
bulimic behaviors, and oral control (exercising control of
over eating or anorexia). This study will focus on the con-
cepts of time, rhythm, improvisation, orality, and spiritual-
ity from the TRIOS measure.
Hypotheses
First, we expect time orientation to be related to dieting
(hypothesis 1). According to TRIOS, time relates to one's
own personal perspective on the past and future. For past
orientation, time has no independent value; time is not the
driver, or the determiner. On the other hand, future orienta-
tion attributes great significance to the concept of time. Past
orientation is more reflective of traditional African cultural
systems which value connecting with ancestors and history
(Jones, 2003). In contrast, future orientation is more preva-
lent in Western culture. In Western culture, a future orienta-
tion is coupled with individualistic and goal-oriented
attitudes (Kelley and Worthley, 1981). Previous research
has found that African Americans are more past-oriented
and that European Americans are more future-oriented;
these differences in temporal orientation have been related
to health outcomes and health management (Brown and
Segal, 1996).
In future orientation, behaviors, including eating, are
more regimented. In past orientation, behaviors, including
eating, are more organic and less tied to prescribed, exter-
nal sources (Mbiti, 1990). Dieting is related to a focus on
the future; if a person struggles in the moment they will be
rewarded in the future with a thin body. Past orientation
may be related to enjoying the eating experience with less
concern for future consequences, such as weight gain.
Present orientation may also view food as a means of con-
necting with African or African American culture and his-
tory, and those who endorse this view of time may derive
more enjoyment and purpose from food. We predict that a
strong past temporal orientation will predict less dieting
behaviors as these behaviors are related to the future conse-
quences of food and eating.
Second, we expect improvisation orientation to be
related to bulimia (hypothesis 2). Improvisation is one's
ability to creatively solve problems and adapt to overcome
barriers. Improvisation also reflects personal expression
and style. African American culture fosters an improvisa-
tional orientation, which has been hypothesized to be
related to attitudes about appearance and the body for
women (Lovejoy, 2001). Improvisation is linked to a
greater appreciation of creative style rather than a fixation
on rigid standards of physical appearance (Lovejoy, 2001).
Racial differences in standards of appearance and the body
have been hypothesized to be related to African Americans
having more fluid and flexible notions regarding standards
of beauty and also less emphasis on external appearance
(Lovejoy, 2001). Less restrictive standards of appearance
are related to less eating behaviors (Hewitt et al., 1995).
Therefore, we expect greater improvisation orientation to
be related to less bulimia.
Third, we expect people who score high on improvisa-
tion to show less restrictive eating (oral control) (hypothe-
sis 3). In addition to being able to meet the challenges of
everyday life, improvisation includes optimism about the
future (Jones, 2003). We hypothesize that people who feel
capable of overcoming the obstacles that life throws at
them will be less afraid of the possible negative conse-
quences of eating and therefore less likely to show restric-
tive eating patterns.
Fourth, we do not expect a significant gender differ-
ences in eating disorder symptomatology nor cultural ori-
entation. Recent studies examining the relationship between
men and maladaptive eating behaviors suggests that while
the gender imbalance still exists, the differences in eating
disorder diagnoses between men and women may not be as
great as previous literature has reported (Anderson and
Bulik, 2004). Further research suggests that this gender dif-
ference is even smaller in the African American community
(Croll et al., 2002). Gender differences inAfricanAmerican
culture have not been empirically measured. We have no
reason to hypothesize a specific difference for African
American men and women.
Method
Participants
These data were collected as part of a study examining
African American college students' daily experiences. In
Total, 439 self-identified African American second- and
third-year undergraduate students were recruited from three
universities in the United States (112 men and 327 women).
Participants'agesrangedfrom19to22years(M=19.8years,
standard deviation (SD)=.95years). The students were
recruited from three universities: a large public university
in the Midwest that is predominantly European American
(n=159); a large public university in the Southeast that is
also predominantly European American (n=151); and a
medium-size private university on the East Coast that is
historically African American (n=129). The mean income
Oney et al. 3
of the participant's parents ranged between US$55,000 and
US$64,999, while individual incomes ranged from less
than US$4999 to over US$105,000.
Procedure
Two procedures were employed to recruit participants for
this study. The office of the registrar at the two predomi-
nantly European American universities provided contact
information for all students who self-identified as African
American on their admissions applications. We used this
information to recruit students via email and telephone
solicitations. At the historically African American univer-
sity, researchers relied on campus-wide outreach methods
including fliers, word of mouth advertising, and classroom
announcements. At all three institutions, researchers asked
potential participants screening questions to ensure that
they self-identified as African American and were at least
18
years of age. If students answered affirmative to those
questions, they were asked to participate in a study examin-
ing African American student's daily experiences pertain-
ing to race. The students then scheduled a time to come to a
laboratory space to complete a web-based survey within
2
weeks of initial contact. Participants completed instru-
ments assessing racial identity, psychological well-being,
racial experiences, cultural orientation, and demographics.
Participants were paid US$15.
Measures
Eating behaviors.Eating patterns were assessed using the
Eating Attitudes Test­26 (EAT-26), a 26-item measure
assess eating disorder symptomatology (Garner et al., 1982).
This scale has been used in nonclinical samples as a con-
tinuous variable, due to the low base rate of clinical eating
behaviors found in the general population (Mazzeo, 1999;
Sabik and Tylka, 2006). Therefore, we used the EAT-26 as
a continuous measure ranging from 1 (never) to 6 (always).
This scale contains three subscales: dieting (13 items;
=.90), bulimic tendencies (6 items; =.71), and oral con-
trol (7 items; =.65) (Garner et al., 1982). The dieting sub-
scale evaluated perceptions of body image, nutritional
attitudes, and eating habits. A sample item is "I am preoc-
cupied with the desire to be thinner." The bulimia subscale
assesses binging and purging behaviors. A sample item is "I
have gone on eating binges where I felt that I may not be
able to stop." The oral control subscale evaluates a person's
attempts to exercise control over the circumstances of eating
and is similar to anorexia nervosa symptomatology. A sam-
ple item is "I avoid eating when I am, hungry." A higher
score on any of the three subscales means a greater endorse-
ment of those attitudes or behaviors. Participants' scale
scores were calculated by averaging across the items to
which the participant responded, which allowed for the use
of the response anchors to interpret the scale scores.
Cultural orientation.For this study, we used Jones's TRIOS
scale, a 28-item measure of dimensions of African American
cultural identity. The five dimensions of African American
culture give TRIOS its name: time, rhythm, improvisation,
orality, and spirituality (Jones, 2003). Participants use a scale
ranging from -3 (very untrue) to 3 (very true) to rate the
extent to which they agreed with each item. The time sub-
scale (six items; 
=
.70) measures the strength of personal
present­past orientation (as opposed to future orientation), as
this has been a historical tenet in African cultural systems
(Jones, 2003). A sample item is "Preparing for what might
happened in the future is often a waste of time." The rhythm
subscale (five items; 
=
.71) measures the strength of the
internal responses to the rhythmic patterns found in the
external world (Jones, 2003).Asample item is "I have a flow
to my life that connects me with my environment." The
improvisation subscale (seven items; =.79) examines the
extent to which a person uses goal-directed creative problem
solving as a means of control and structure in interactions
with others (Jones, 2003). A sample item is "When a situa-
tion arises, I usually know 2 to 3 different ways to handle it."
The orality subscale (three items; =.80) measures the pref-
erences for oral face-to-face communication and personal
expression and endorses the meaningful role of spoken
words in human affairs. A sample item is "In my social
group, laughter often holds us together." The spirituality sub-
scale (seven items; 
=
.92) accesses the degree to which a
person believes in the value of a higher power and unknown
forces that influence all living things and one's life in par-
ticular (Jones, 2003). A sample item is "In most aspects of
my life, I am strengthened by my spiritual beliefs." For each
subscale, higher scores corresponded with a greater strength
in the endorsement of that cultural ideology. Participants'
scale scores were calculated by averaging across the items to
which the participant responded, thus allowing for the use of
the response anchors to interpret the scale scores.
Body mass index. Participants self-reported their height and
weight which were converted into a body mass index (BMI:
weight in kg/height in m2) score. A BMI of 25 is the thresh-
old for the overweight category according for the Center
for Disease Control, while 30 is the threshold for obesity
(Flegal et al., 1998). However, it should be noted that there
is some controversy about the classification of weight sta-
tus using BMI for African Americans (Deurenberg and
Deurenberg-Yap, 2001).
Results
The means and SDs for all measures are presented in Table 1.
Overall, participants showed a past-time orientation (a nega-
tive TRIOS-TIME score), strong spiritual beliefs (a high
TRIOS-SPIRIT score), a preference for humor and storytell-
ing (a high TRIOS-ORAL score), an ability to adapt to chal-
lenging situations (a high TRIOS-IMPROV score), and an
4 Health Psychology Open 
appreciation of the role of music and rhythm in shaping eve-
ryday living (a high TRIOS-RHYTHM score).
The eating disorder scores from the EAT-26 (Table 1)
were significantly lower than those reported by majority
European American women samples (Mazzeo, 1999; Sabik
and Tylka, 2006; Tylka and Sabik, 2010). These eating dis-
order scores were also slightly lower than a sample of all
African American women (Akan and Grilo, 1994). The
BMI of participants ranged from 16.46 to 51.68. The mean
BMI was 25.17 (SD=5.31), indicating that the average par-
ticipant was classified as overweight.
The correlations (presented in Table 1) indicate that cul-
tural orientation (TRIOS) was negatively correlated with
disordered eating behaviors and attitudes. The exception
was time orientation, which was negatively related to diet-
ing, but unrelated to bulimia and oral control. These results
indicate that stronger African American cultural orienta-
tions are associated with less eating disordered behaviors
and attitudes of dieting, bulimia, and oral control.
Cultural identity as a predictor of eating
behaviors
Hypothesis 1 was supported with additional results.
Multiple regression was used to determine the impact of
TRIOS-RHYTHM, TRIOS-IMPROV, TRIOS-ORAL,
TRIOS-SPIRIT, and TRIOS-TIME on EAT-DIETING.
Screening of the data demonstrated linearity, the absence of
multicollinearity, a lack of univariate and multivariate out-
liers, and homoscedasticity of residuals. Regression results

Hypothesis 4 was partially supported. As predicted,
mean gender differences in study variables were examined
in the analysis presented in Table 5. There were no gender
differences in any of the disordered eating variables.
However, contrary to our hypothesis, there were gender dif-
ferences with regard to time, spirituality, and improvisa-
tion. Men were more likely to be of a present orientation,
women were more likely to be spiritually oriented, and men
were more likely to display improvisation.
Discussion
Time orientation was related to dieting forAfricanAmerican
men and women. The greater endorsement of future orienta-
tion (as opposed to past orientation) was related to more
dieting. In a future orientation, food may be viewed as a
means to an end. For instance, if a person aims to maintain
or achieve a culturally desired thin body size, eating may be
viewed as a means to achieve that goal. This relationship
supports the notion that if a person uses discipline and self-
control through restriction of food, there will be benefits or
a pay-off in the future when they obtain their desired body.
High levels of improvisation orientation were related
to less bulimic behaviors. This may suggest that the use of
creative problem solving in the face of stress may be a key
factor in this relationship. A person with high improvisation

orientation might face an emotionally taxing situation with
better resources instead of turning the stress inwards, using
eating as a means of coping. Binge eating demonstrates a loss
of control where purging demonstrates a maladaptive coping
method to regain control. Improvisation also endorses per-
sonal expressiveness or style. Perhaps African Americans
endorse more fluid notions of beauty, which means standards
are not rigid or fixed by restrictive standards of body size/
shape rather style, attitude, and other characteristics can make
someone attractive or beautiful as well (Parker et al., 1995).
As hypothesized, we found that improvisation is related
to lower levels of maladaptive food control (oral control).
Using food to regulate mood is a maladaptive coping mech-
anism that can contribute to the development of maladap-
tive eating behaviors (Sims et al., 2008). Perceived stress is
commonly linked to binge eating episodes which can lead
to increased obesity and long-term health risks (Ng and
Jeffery, 2003). However, stress can also contribute to a
desire to restrict eating. Ruggiero et al. (2008) have shown
that high levels of stress are linked to an increased drive for
thinness and more body dissatisfaction. High levels of
improvisation are linked to more active coping mechanisms
and less reliance on manipulating food intake when dealing
with stressful situations. African Americans who show
higher levels of improvisation are more optimistic and
engage in more effective problem solving. These individuals
feel a sense of control no matter what is going wrong with
their lives and this may allow them to maintain healthier
eating patterns.
A strong spiritual orientation was related to less bulimic
behaviors, a relationship that was not originally hypothe-
sized. Richards et al. (2007) have previously shown that
attending to a patient's spiritual growth may significantly
reduce eating disorder symptoms when used as part of a
comprehensive treatment plan. Jacobs-Pilipski et al. (2005)
found that college women who rated spirituality as impor-
tant were significantly more likely to use their spiritual
beliefs and practices (i.e. praying, meditating, reading spir-
itual/religious texts) as a way to cope with distress related to
eating. This study suggests that the use of spiritual beliefs
and practices as coping mechanisms for distress related to
eating could help prevent the development of maladaptive
eating behaviors for both men and women. Greater belief in
a higher power may also be related to respecting and accept-
ing the body in its natural form and thus less likely to abuse
one's body by binging, purging, or pills.
Spirituality can be expressed in many ways including
through organized religion. In Christianity, one's body is
conceptualized as the temple of the Holy Spirit (Parker
et al., 1995). The body has greater significance than its out-
ward appearance; instead, it is a vehicle to do God's will.
Therefore, harming one's body through starvation, binging,
and purging, or eating excessively could be perceived as
contrary to God's will. In the African American community,
the church is a safe haven and a source of social support. It
is also a place where a person can find comfort and display
their own sense of style and these expressions will be appre-
ciated by others (Parker et al., 1995).
Previous research on eating behaviors and spirituality
has focused on how spirituality can be used in the treatment
of disordered eating behaviors (Emmett, 2007). Spirituality
has been shown to have a positive effect on African
Americans' physical health and psychological well-being
(Blaine and Crocker, 1995; Bowen-Reid and Harrell, 2002;
Bowen-Reid and Smalls, 2004). This study builds on this
body of literature for African American populations.
This study found no gender difference in dieting,
bulimia, and oral control. This is consistent with previous
research which suggests gender differences of eating pat-
terns are not as large in the African American community
compared to the European American community (Croll
et al., 2002). These results were contrary to a previous
study (Taylor et al., 2007), which found that African
American women suffer from disordered eating behaviors
at a higher rate than men.
Contrary to our hypotheses, there were gender differences
in three dimensions of cultural orientation. Men were more
past-oriented in our study although previous research has
been mixed about gender differences in time orientation
(Harber et al., 2003; Padawer et al., 2007). Women were more
spiritually oriented; this finding is expected since women
are often viewed as the bearers of culture within a family.
Spirituality is more central to African American culture
(Jones, 2003) and spirituality may hold a special meaning for
AfricanAmerican women as the church is often an institution
to transmit culture (Lincoln and Mamiya, 1990). In addition,
the African American church is often a place of female lead-
ership and predominant female membership. Finally, men
showed higher levels of improvisation. This may be due to
the higher levels of collective coping shown in African
American men (Lewis-Coles and Constantine, 2006).
Implications of findings
This study highlighted the importance of culture, not gen-
der in eating behaviors. This is contrary to previous research
which suggests the gender is a strong predictor of maladap-
tive eating patterns in the majority of European American
samples (Lewinsohn et al., 2002). Our results also reveal
the possible role of effective problem solving and coping
skills in relation to eating behaviors (Lobera et al., 2009).
Both improvisation and spirituality have components of
these skills, which may be the driving force in their rela-
tionship to eating behaviors.
African American culture is related to less maladaptive
eating behaviors, but not necessarily related to healthy eat-
ing. Results of this study suggest that African American cul-
ture may reject the thin ideal but may be linked to higher
levels of obesity. Conventional weight-loss methods are
often regimented in nature and may be related to cultural

aligned with African American cultural orientation may be
more effective in achieving effective and long lasting weight
loss.
Limitations
This study was limited to a college-aged population and
thus might not be representative of the majority of African
Americans. In addition, there may also be a cohort effect
depending on cultural attitudes and orientation. Also, this
study could potentially determine the basis for a causal
relationship between cultural orientation and eating behav-
iors. However, future longitudinal research would be
needed to establish the exact nature of this relationship.
Finally, other factors related to eating behaviors, such as
physical activity levels, were not included in this study.
Conclusion
This study highlights the significance of cultural attitudes
in-group comparisons and clarifies previous research which
suggests African Americans are uniformly protected against
maladaptive eating behaviors. Instead, the study demon-
strated that spirituality, improvisation, and time orientations
are specific aspects of African American culture which are
significantly related to less eating disordered behaviors.
Identifying these aspects of culture in African Americans
can be used to plan more efficacious treatments as well as
aiding in the prevention of maladaptive eating behaviors.
