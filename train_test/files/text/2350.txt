ABSTRACT
We use 9 Add Health high schools with longi-
tudinal network data to assess whether adoles-
cent drinkers choose friends who drink, prefer
friends whose friends drink, if selection differs
between new and existing friendships, and be-
tween schools. Utilizing dynamic social network
models that control for friend influences on in-
dividual alcohol use, the results show that drin-
kers do not strongly prefer friends who drink.
Instead, they favor close friends whose friends'
drink, suggesting that alcohol matters for selec-
tion on the social groups and environments that
friends connect each other to. The role of alco-
hol use differs by whether friendships are new
or existing, however, with bridging connections
being less stable. Moreover, selection processes,
and the implications of alcohol use for friend-
ship, vary in important ways between schools.

1. INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of alcohol use in adolescence suggests
that it is an important avenue by which teens integrate
socially with peers away from adult supervision. By 12th
grade over 70% of teens have tried alcohol and low non-
continuation rates below 10% indicate that most adoles-
cents continue to drink [1]. The high rates of individual
use reflect the fact that teens regularly expose each other
to alcohol. Approximately 50% of 12th graders report
they often drink in the company of other youth and that
most or all of their friends drink frequently, and 75% re-
port that one or more friends drink until drunk each week
[2]. As a common, socially embedded activity in adoles-
cence, alcohol use taps into a core set of social behaviors
not condoned by adults but that are key to understanding
adolescent society [3]. The purpose of this study, there-
fore, is to examine the role of alcohol use in the friend-
ship formation (creation of a new friendship) and dura-
bility (maintenance of an existing friendship) during a
developmentally important stage of life. We address this
purpose by applying longitudinal stochastic actor based
models of social network dynamics [4] to 9 schools from
the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(Add Health).
2. LITERATURE REVIEW
Social integration refers to the number of social rela-
tions one has, in addition to the type and frequency of
contact [5]. We continue the traditional focus on social
networks as indicators of integration [6], but take a dyna-
mic view that considers friendship change and stability
in peer relationships. We emphasize the role of homo-
phily, the tendency for individuals with similar charac-
teristics to befriend one another, as one important avenue
by which alcohol use can promote social relationships
that foster social integration.

Researchers have long noted that friendships tend to
be homophilous on social characteristics [7]. This ten-
dency is replicated for adolescent health-risk behaviors
[8] and alcohol use is no exception [9]. Given the wide-

spread diffusion of drinking and its associated risks [10]
over this phase of life, there is a critical need for research
articulating how alcohol use is intertwined in friendships
as a socially integrative behavior. Recent findings gene-
rally support dual roles of alcohol use in homophilous
friendship selection and social influence, though there is
disagreement about when each process emerges over ado-
lescence [11-13]. We focus here on the role of homophi-
lous friend selection. Thus, our first hypothesis is dyadic:
adolescents prefer to be friends with teens who have
similar alcohol use levels.
Adolescent socializing takes place both with close
friends and broader collections of peers, some of whom
are sociometrially closer than others. For example, teens
often spend time in the company of friends' friends [14],
which leads to indirect connections, shared social envi-
ronments, and new friendship opportunities. Reflecting
this complexity, recent studies report that friends' friends
influence health risk behaviors [15,16] including alcohol
use [17]. This points to the need to consider interpersonal
processes extending beyond immediate friends and out to
less intimate acquaintances [18,19].
Payne and Cornwell [19] argue that adolescents are
socially strategic and that they adopt behaviors to im-
press their close friends by modeling the actions of indi-
rect but still closely connected contacts. However, this
logic may also work the other way: adolescents who en-
joy drinking and partying may prefer friends who con-
nect them to other drinkers, with the result that they form
friendships strategically. To the extent this is so, friend-
ships may form precisely because of the broader set of
connections they bring when a party behavior like alco-
hol use that takes place in social contexts is considered.
Drinking may thus integrate adolescents beyond their
closest social ties and out into broader social circles--ef-
fectively expanding the social milieu they participate in,
and making peers who connect them to other drinkers
more attractive. Consequently, our second hypothesis is
that adolescent drinkers prefer friends whose friends
drink.
We further suggest that alcohol use should promote
durable bonds if it is socially integrative. Friendships,
however, change all the time [20]. The question of whe-
ther alcohol use plays different roles as friendships de-
velop and mature is a possibility that prior research has
only partly addressed. For example, using tabular me-
thods, Fisher and Bauman [21], found that alcohol use
was more strongly related to the acquisition of friends,
was less strongly related to influence, and was not re-
lated to friendship durability. If alcohol use is associated
with higher turnover among friends, however, then
drinking undercuts integration even while setting the
stage for it. Asymmetries in friendship processes be-
tween new and existing friendships would be reflected in
differential tendencies for relations to form versus being
maintained over time.
Thus, our final hypotheses modify our first two by
disaggregating friendship into formation and durability
processes. Prior work on social network selection using
statistical models has conflated these processes. With
this in mind, the third hypothesis is that alcohol users
form new friendships with one another and the fourth
hypothesis is that relationships homophilous on alcohol
use are less durable and thus are less likely to be main-
tained over time.
3. DATA AND METHODS
Data come from Add Health's in-school assessment at
wave 1 (observation 1) along with its in-home wave 1
and 2 (observations 2 and 3) components. Add Health is
a cluster stratified study of 7th -12th grade youth begun
in 1994 with in-school questionnaires administered to ap-
proximately 90,000 students in 140 schools. A nationally
representative sample of 20,000 students was drawn
from the in-school study, and data were collected in-
home in 1995 and again approximately one year later at
wave 2. This longitudinal sample consisted of a special
subsample of 16 "saturated" schools in which friendship
data were collected for all attending 7-12th grade stu-
dents. The sample for this study utilizes 9 of the high
schools (N = 3329) with response rates adequate for so-
cial network analysis [22]. 1,704 adolescents come from
the large, racially heterogeneous high school, 829 from a
middle-sized predominantly white high school, and 798
from the seven small (N < 300) k-12th grade high
schools. Missing network data were handled using the
composition change method [23], so that all youth were
included in the analysis and allowed to enter the study
later or leave early (e.g., graduates, movers, dropouts).
Missing alcohol and attribute data were treated as non-
informative and imputed within the model [22].
3.1. Variables
The focal dependent variable, the friendship network
matrix, maps the interconnections between individuals
and so captures the system and structure of relationships
among adolescents in the 9 schools (see [24]). The ado-
lescent friendship network is constructed from two sets
of variables requesting nominations of up to five male
and five female friends from the school roster at each
observation. The repeated, longitudinal assessments of
the social network provide the analytic leverage for
studying friend selection and thus social integration. Due
to a sampling error a subset of students was given only a
single nomination opportunity at observation 2 (the
wave-1 in home assessment) so that the full friendship
network was not captured for approximately 40% of the

small school youth, and 5% of those attending the me-
dium white and large minority schools. We randomly
carried either the observation 1 or 3 nominations forward
or backwards in order to backfill the missing nomina-
tions and preserve the network. Descriptive statistics for
the network are provided in Table 1.
Alcohol use frequency, the focal independent variable,
is based on the question, "During the last 12 months, on
how many days did you drink alcohol?" This item em-
ploys a standard alcohol use intensity assessment that
was measured as a six-point scale with values for never
drinks, once or twice in the last year, once a month or
less, 2 - 3 days a month, 1 - 2 days a week, and 3 to 5
days a week, and every day or almost every day. Because
we found that sparse distributions in the upper categories
produced instability in the estimation routines when peer
influence was controlled for, we top-coded alcohol use at
the fourth category--2 - 3 days per month. Descriptive
statistics for alcohol use similarity among direct and in-
direct friends are shown in Table 1, and statistics de-
scribing individual alcohol use over time are shown in
Table 2.

An indicator for female is included to reflect the gen-
dered structure of adolescent social networks. Race/eth-
nic background is included in two ways to reflect com-
positional differences across schools. First, an indicator
of nonwhite status for all schools except the large mino-
rity school, while indicators for Hispanic, Asian, and
white are included with African American omitted in this
school. Parent education is included as a linear 5-cate-
gory background control. Additional factors related to
alcohol use include the frequency with which the re-
sponding parent drinks alcohol (1 = never to 6 = nearly
every day), an indicator for whether alcohol is easy to
get, whether the youth is a regular smoker is a time-
varying covariate, an indicator for whether or not the
adolescent's observation 2 nominations were accident-
tally restricted to only a single friend (as noted above),
and the number of off-list nominations (also time-vary-
ing).
3.2. Analytic Strategy & Analysis Plan
The analysis employs the new class of Simulation In-
vestigation for Empirical Network Analysis (SIENA)
models developed by Snijders [25] and colleagues (e.g.,
[4]). The SIENA approach models changes in the
friendship network as a function of individual, dyadic,
and extra-dyadic alcohol use. Observation 1 is a starting
point for the estimation routine so that parameters cap-
ture changes in the network across observation periods.
Coefficient estimates capture changes in network sta-
tistics between observations and an agent based simula-
tion model is utilized to update the parameters and esti-
mate their uncertainties. The SIENA model is unique in
that it can be used to jointly model changes in the friend-
ship matrix (selection) and individual behaviors (influ-
ence) so that each process can be isolated from the other.
Moreover, a number of structural network characteristics
can be controlled for with this approach (we include
terms for out degree, reciprocity, transitive triplets, and
3-cycle). Focal coefficients are presented in terms of ego
(nominations of friends), alter (nominations by others),
and their interaction.
The school-specific networks for the 7 smaller k-12th
schools were grouped into a single matrix and analyzed
jointly as others have done with these schools [26,27].
The small schools, medium-sized mostly white and the
large urban minority schools were then analyzed sepa-
rately using the RSIENA software. Differences in key
parameters were then compared across schools using
t-tests.
4. RESULTS
Logit coefficients for the alcohol use selection para-
meters are shown along with standard errors in Table 3
for each of the small (SS), medium (MS), and large
school (LS) networks. Model 1 shows results for the
baseline alcohol selection model including controls for
reciprocity, off list nominations, and whether or not the
respondent was in the restricted nomination sample at
observation 2. As with most studies conducted utilizing
the SIENA approach, the homophilous ego-alter selec-
tion parameter is held equal for the formation of new
friendships and the durability of existing relationships.
Although the effect magnitudes are consistent across
networks, Model 2 suggests that this approach masks
heterogeneity in both alcohol-based selection and the
differential contributions of alcohol use to new and exis-
ting friend processes across networks. For both the SS
and MS, alcohol use is related to new friendships, and
the effect is much larger than in Model 1 because the
effect of homophily on friendship durability in existing
relationships is close to 0. The ego-alter creation coeffi-
cient is also significant for the LS, but in contrast to the
others, friendships among drinkers are significantly less
durable--in this model, alcohol use is found to create
opportunities for social integration through the creation
of new friendships, but also to undercut it by facilitating
their turnover.
Model 3 further elaborates the role of drinking in
friend selection processes by including the interaction
between ego's alcohol use with the average drinking of
the potential/existing friend's friends. The ego-alter crea-
tion effect reduces substantially across networks, even
becoming non-significant for the MS. At the same time,
indirect drinking selection is related to the creation of
new friendships and their subsequent loss across net-
works. Moreover, the coefficient sizes are all substan-
tially larger than for dyadic selection. The actual role of
alcohol use in selection is somewhat more complicated
than presented in Model 3, as shown in Model 4 when
friend influence on alcohol use (of both close friends and
their friends) is incorporated into the equation. When in-
direct connections to other drinkers are considered, dya-
dic selection is no longer found to be significant for the
LS, though this reflects a large increase in the SE relative
to the coefficient. Additionally, the loss of bridging ties
to other drinkers is no longer significant in the LS, where
indirect selection is found to primarily influence new
friendships to other drinkers. In the SS and MS, however,
existing dyadic friendships are more stable while the
ego-alter creation parameter is no longer significant. The
complex relationship between individuals and their
friend's friends' alcohol use persist for these schools,
however.
Model 5 adds the structural network parameters for
transitive triplets and 3-cycle to account for structural
processes that influence friendships [28]. These results
suggest that durability of friendships bridging to other

drinkers in the MS actually reflects network closure. In
other words, homophilous friendships are more durable
because they are embedded in larger sets of overlapping
friendships. Model 6 adds the additional control vari-
ables (full results available upon request). In addition, al-
though results changed between Models 3 and 4 when
friend and friends' friends' influences on alcohol use
were included, Model 6 and selection-only results (not
shown) are quite similar, but the precision with which
the parameters are estimated differs markedly. t-test re-
sults comparing coefficients across networks suggest so-
mewhat different processes across settings. Although the
processes are similar overall in the SS and MS, the LS
differs from these schools: homophilous direct relation-
ships are less durable in the LS (tMS
= 3.14, alter, ego x
alter keep friends tSS
= 2.36 and tMS
= 2.21), but bridging
connections (ego x alter at distance = 2, keep) linking
drinkers are less durable in the SS (t = 12.32) and MS (t
= 12.20).
5. DISCUSSION
Understanding alcohol use preferences in friendship
choices is integral for deepening theoretical understand-
ing of an important social process, social integration,
during adolescence. One mechanism of social integration,
homophilous friendship selection, has been a primary
concern among researchers because it is generally not ac-
counted for in peer influence estimates and the cones-
quences can be quite diverse: biased expectations for
interventions (e.g., [29]), obscured potential intervention
strategies [30], and adversely modified intervention ef-
fects in the field [31]. Given the dangers of friend selec-
tion for undermining programs, and the fact that studies
suggest that selection processes typically bias and even
trump peer influences in importance [21], understanding
it substantively is as critical as controlling for it in influ-
ence studies.
Although a number of recent studies now address
friend influences on alcohol use accounting for homo-
philous selection [11-13], we argued that friendship se-
lection processes are more complicated than recent stu-
dies using longitudinal network models have indicated
[21]. Using dynamic social network analysis, we have in
fact showed that to be the case. First, in contrast to most
prior studies, we approached friendship selection from
the view that it comprises both creation and durability
processes that could differ from one another. The fin-
dings from 9 schools of varying sizes and composition
support this contention. Approaching alcohol use from
the perspective that its role in new and existing friend-
ships is equivalent clearly masks heterogeneity in the
role it plays in fostering friendships.
Second, drinking selection appears to be less a proper-
ty of dyads, as has typically been assumed, and more
about indirect selection that promotes access to other
drinkers. Adolescent drinkers prefer friends that connect
them to other drinkers, which suggests that friendship in
adolescence has much to do with the social environments
that adolescents provide one another through their social
contacts. This was found to promote the creation of new
friendships across networks, but these friendships were
simultaneously found to be less stable. Network and
other selection processes contribute to creating stability
in these bridging connections, but they still tend to turn-
over more quickly. The result is that alcohol use is a pa-
thway by which adolescents connect with one another,
but it tends to create new ties at the expense of the old.
Despite the small dyadic effect on friendship durability
in the mid-sized school, the overall trend is that alcohol
use sets the stage for integration but does not create
deeper forms of social connection. Selection on other
factors is necessary to create deeper forms of integration.
Our third point is that these processes vary across set-
tings in important ways that are not yet fully understood:
in some cases, alcohol use is associated with the loss of
ties that bridge drinkers, but this is not always the case,
as shown by the large minority school. Interestingly, dif-
ferences across schools would not have been evident had
we merely looked at the ego-alter interaction parameter,
which is a baseline measure of homophilous selection.
This effect was quite similar across schools, and differ-
rences only emerged when we disaggregated the para-
meter for the creation of new and durability of existing
ties. In essence, the conflicting role of alcohol in these
processes drives the parameter towards zero and thereby
lessens variations across networks.
This latter point also reveals important limitations
specific to this study. The Add Health longitudinal net-
work sample is one of convenience and it is idiosyncratic
for that reason. At the same time, however, the schools
are quite variant. Given that school size, composition,
and urbanicity are all confounded in this study, future
work with more diverse samples will be necessary to fur-
ther illuminate heterogeneity in these processes.
The analyses are also limited in other ways. For ex-
