Objectives. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between two forms of helping behavior among
older adults--informal caregiving and formal volunteer activity.
Methods. To evaluate our hypotheses, we employed Tobit regression models to analyze panel data from the first two
waves of the Americans' Changing Lives survey.
Results. We found that older adult caregivers were more likely to be volunteers than noncaregivers. Caregivers who
provided a relatively high number of caregiving hours annually reported a greater number of volunteer hours than did
noncaregivers. Caregivers who provided care to nonrelatives were more likely than noncaregivers to be a volunteer and to
volunteer more hours. Finally, caregivers were more likely than noncaregivers to be asked to volunteer.
Discussion. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that caregivers are embedded in networks that provide them
with more opportunities for volunteering. Additional research on the motivations for volunteering and greater attention to
the context and hierarchy of caregiving and volunteering are needed.
RESEARCHERS who study social and productive activ-
ities among older adults increasingly focus on the ways in
which the myriad forms of these activities are related to one
another (e.g., Moen, Robison, & Fields 1994). A common
question addressed among these studies is whether different
forms of productive activity are complementary or whether
participation in one activity impedes participation in another
activity (e.g., Gallagher 1994). To our knowledge, no study has
investigated the association between informal caregiving and
formal volunteering--two types of helping behavior taking
place in different social contexts. However, a few studies have
examined the relationship between care work and other forms
of social activity; this research literature provides important
clues guiding our study.
Formal volunteering, a type of structured helping behavior
typically undertaken in public settings, is a discretionary
activity for most persons. We defined formal volunteering as
activity involving a person's time and effort that is not
compensated by regular payment or monetary reward, but is
freely undertaken and produces goods and services for
organizations, and by extension, for other individuals (Wilson
& Musick, 1997). We focused on volunteer work or service (a
social activity) as compared to voluntary group membership
(a social status; see Wilson, 2000). Among older adults,
engagement in volunteer activities in formal settings constitutes
an important forum for their productive contribution to their
communities and the larger society.
Providing care informally to persons in one's social network
is often considered an obligatory activity, especially when the
care recipient is a family member. This type of helping
behavior is less structured than volunteering and is undertaken
in private as opposed to public venues. Caregiving is not as
common an activity as volunteering, in that at any given time
a relatively small proportion of the population is arranging for
or providing care to persons who have a debilitating physical or
mental health condition. However, when a person assumes
a caregiver role, the commitment of time may be substantial. In
some cases (e.g., caring for a spouse with Alzheimer's disease),
caregiving represents an all-encompassing activity that makes it
difficult to engage in other productive or social activities. Other
forms of caregiving are likely to be not so intensive or time
consuming (e.g., intermittently providing care for distant
relatives or nonrelatives) and, therefore, may allow for engage-
ment in additional productive, social, leisure, and self-
improvement pursuits.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether informal
caregiving among older adults is related to formal volunteer
service. Caregivers may be more likely to volunteer and show
a stronger commitment to volunteer activities as an extension of
their caregiving routines, in part because this activity brings
them into increased contact with social networks and
organizations that provide information about and opportunities
for volunteering. We employed data from the 1986 and 1989
Americans' Changing Lives survey to examine these issues.
It may also be argued that volunteers are more likely to be
caregivers. We suspect that if such a relationship exists, it may
be more likely that volunteering puts people into contact with
others who are aware of ill or disabled persons who need care.
This would be most likely to lead to caregiving opportunities
for nonrelatives, because a potential caregiver is likely to be
aware of relatives needing care. In fact, Wilson and Musick
(1997) found that volunteering predicted informal helping
behavior (e.g., helping friends or neighbors with running
errands, transportation, etc.) but not the reverse (see also
Gallagher, 1994). However, in this article, we assumed that the
often obligatory nature of caregiving was more likely to bring
caregivers into contact with organizations that need volunteers
than is the case for discretionary volunteering. Thus, we
developed below a framework proposing that caregiving creates
opportunities and motives for volunteering.

LITERATURE REVIEW
While researchers have apparently not examined the
association between caregiving roles (an often obligatory
activity) and volunteer roles (a discretionary activity), there is
a small body of research that considers care work as it relates to
the caregivers' capacity to participate in voluntary associations
and other social pursuits. The findings from these studies are
equivocal due in part to the employment of idiosyncratic
samples, use of alternative measures of caregiving and social
activity, and variability in the age groups examined. These
studies are nevertheless informative for establishing the
hypotheses for our investigation of caregiving and volunteering.
Some research suggests that caregiving impedes the ability to
engage in productive and social activity. Skaff and Pearlin
(1992) argued that caregiving for persons with Alzheimer's
disease may become so overwhelming as to result in a ``loss of
self'' and thus fewer social roles are accepted and social activity
is limited. Other research supports this finding by showing that
older caregivers participated in fewer social activities (George
& Gwyther, 1986), and caregivers who reported high demands
related to their care work also perceived themselves to be in-
volved in fewer social activities (Miller & Montgomery, 1990).
Another stream of research shows that it is informative to
consider the type of caregiving and the time committed to
caregiving when considering the effects on social activity and
belonging to voluntary associations. This research indicates that
some characteristics of caregiving actually lead to increased
levels of social activity and organizational membership. Using
data from the National Survey of Families and Households,
Hoyert and Seltzer (1992) analyzed the social activities of adult
female caregivers who care for spouses, children or parents. In
general, they found that caregivers participated in more
organizations than noncaregivers, suggesting that participation
in these activities may provide temporary relief from their
caregiving responsibilities and burden. They found that female
caregivers who care for spouses participate in the fewest social
activities and organizations when compared to women caring
for nonspouse relatives and others. Women providing care for
children engaged in more activities than noncaregivers, and
women providing care for parents engaged in fewer social
activities. They also showed that the longer that their sample of
women were involved in care work, the more likely they were
to experience negative outcomes.
Farkas and Himes (1997) employed cross-sectional data from
the 1987 National Survey of Families and Households to
examine whether middle-aged and older women's caregiving
roles and employment status positively or negatively impacted
a wide range of voluntary social activities. Focusing on family-
centered activities, association with formal groups, and casual
activity, they found that caregiving does not reduce participation
in family activity or formal groups, and at least for middle-aged
women, caregiving was predictive of greater casual activity
(e.g., recreation, time spent with friends). They also found
evidence that older women who engaged in paid work and
provided care were less likely to engage in family and formal
activities, indicating that both roles combined have a dampening
effect on these types of activities. Examining caregiver-recipient
models, they found that middle-aged women caring for parents
were more likely to engage in family and formal activities.
Toward an Explanation for the Link Between
Caregiving and Volunteering
How might care work be linked to volunteer activity and
under what circumstances? According to Wilson (2000), there
are two broad approaches employed to explain why people
volunteer. One approach is based on social psychological
reasoning that attempts to identify how motives, values, and
belief systems ``inspire volunteering'' (p. 218). Early sociali-
zation, educational experiences, and family background
characteristics influence underlying impulses to help others in
the public sphere (Wuthnow, 1995). This is sometimes referred
to as cultural capital. The second approach is a behaviorist
perspective, focusing on a cost-benefit or rational choice
framework. Social resources such as social network character-
istics and family relations, sometimes referred to as social
capital (Wilson & Musick, 1997), represent another set of
characteristics increasing the opportunities for and likelihood of
volunteering. Also important to this set of arguments are the
influences of employment characteristics, levels and types of
education, and income, sometimes referred to as human capital.
The caregiving role as related to volunteering encompasses
features of each broad theoretical approach. Caregiving provides
caregivers with unique motivations and opportunities to volun-
teer in their communities in ways not commonly encountered by
noncaregivers. Caregivers typically do not carry out their
helping roles in isolation. Assistance is received from organi-
zations, sometimes at low or no cost to the caregiver, which
makes the task of providing care to ill or disabled persons
residing in the community easier and more feasible. Receiving
this assistance likely produces a sense of gratitude among care-
givers, who in turn may feel motivated to repay this debt, in part,
through the act of volunteering, if not directly to the organiza-
tions providing help, then in a more generalized sense to other
helping organizations (Wuthnow, 1998).
Further, caregivers are often embedded in social networks
that include other caregivers. Studies show that many primary
caregivers have secondary or tertiary helpers--such as adult
children, other relatives, friends, and neighbors--who provide
financial, instrumental, and/or emotional assistance both to the
person receiving care and to the caregiver (Mui, Choi, & Monk,
1998). These helpers form a complex social network that may
provide additional information about volunteer opportunities
with formal organizations. The social networks of caregivers
link them to other persons who may be volunteers, to
information about volunteer programs, and to organizations
that seek volunteers (Wuthnow, 1995). Because the service
organizations that caregivers rely on to assist in the care of an ill
or disabled person are often underfunded, understaffed, or both,
these organizations seek out volunteers to help them fulfill their
missions. Caregivers interact with organizations that often have
the most need, and thus they are more likely to be asked to
volunteer (Wilson, 2000).
We have provided some examples to demonstrate how these
two factors--opportunity and motivation--link caregivers to
volunteering. Someone who cares for an elderly parent may
interact with formal support organizations such as a senior
center or an adult day care center. The relationship between the
caregiver and these organizations puts the caregiver in
proximity to knowledge about the need for volunteers in these
BURR ET AL.

units. Aging services administrators may reach out directly to
the caregiver asking him or her to participate in directing center
activities or supervising outings for seniors. Caregivers often
have valued skills that are developed or enhanced through the
caregiving role that are important to volunteer organizations.
When caring for elderly parents, caregivers develop commu-
nication skills and knowledge about the unique needs of older
adults, especially those with functional status deficits.
Similarly, caregivers who provide care for a seriously ill or
disabled person often provide help to the person through
interactions with health care service providers (e.g., health
clinics, hospitals) by making appointments, providing trans-
portation, interpreting instructions, and helping with prescribed
therapies. In the act of interfacing with these organizations on
behalf of the care recipient, the informal caregiver learns about
these organizations and about opportunities to volunteer. After
the connection between the care recipient and health care
service provider is finished, or perhaps before, the caregiver
may feel a sense of gratitude toward the organization and
volunteer her or his time to pay back the help received.
Finally, a person caring for a relative or friend who may be
chronically ill (e.g., HIV/AIDS patients, Alzheimer's patients)
may volunteer in the political arena. In providing such care, it is
likely that the caregiver comes into contact with other persons
who also provide care for someone with similar illnesses, either
in a clinical or hospital setting, hospice, or by belonging to
a support group. By virtue of contact with other caregivers,
combined with a desire to improve the conditions of other
persons with similar serious afflictions, the caregiver may
become politically active by doing volunteer work for a political
organization, advocacy group, or political candidate. A
caregiver may volunteer to work for a candidate running for
political office with a platform containing a progressive stance
on AIDS research or a policy supporting increased government
support for long-term care for persons with Alzheimer's
disease. These settings where informal and formal care
interface provide sources of information about ways to become
politically active as well as social support for such activity,
making it more likely that the current or former caregiver will
become an advocate for change. In sum, we expected
caregivers to be more likely than noncaregivers to volunteer
on the basis of their caregiver role and the social networks in
which they are embedded.
Another dimension influencing the complex link between
caregiving and volunteering concerns characteristics of the
caregiver activity. Two dimensions of caregiving considered in
this study include the time committed to caregiving and the
nature of the relationship between the caregiver and care
recipient. Some types of caregiving, such as caring for a person
with an advanced stage of dementia, require a constant vigil,
implying an extraordinary time commitment, taking both
a physical and an emotional toll on the caregiver (e.g., Zarit,
Todd, & Zarit, 1986; however, see Van Willigen, 2000).
Persons who give a substantial amount of their time to the
caregiver role likely must reduce their commitments to other
roles, including volunteering. Thus we expected that persons
providing a low or modest level of care in terms of hours
committed would be more likely to volunteer than persons
providing no care (as noted above) and persons providing
a high amount of care (a curvilinear effect).
Finally, we expected the type of relationship of the caregiver
to the care recipient to impact volunteering behavior. Some
caregivers do not feel they have a choice with respect to their
caregiving responsibilities when the potential care recipient is
a close relative (e.g., a spouse) for reasons of both affection and
norms of social obligation (Gerstel & Gallagher, 1993). Thus,
although the literature on spousal caregiving and social activity
is somewhat sparse, we expected that providing care to a spouse
would either have no relationship to volunteering or at least
reduce the likelihood that a person engages in volunteer activity
and reduce the time commitment to such activity. This
expectation is supported by the fact that caring for a spouse
tends to occur in one's own home (among persons who are
50 years old and older in the Americans' Changing Lives sur-
vey, more than 90% of spousal caregiving is provided in the
respondent's home). Caring for someone in one's home may
limit the number of social network contacts often necessary for
locating volunteer activities.
Research literature reporting on the relationship between
participation in other activities and caregiving for children and
parents is equivocal. Nevertheless, following research by
Farkas and Himes (1997), we expected that caring for a parent
or a child would result in more volunteering, given that there
are numerous organizations and support groups whose mission
is to provide formal help to older persons and children and that
caregivers are likely to come into contact with these
organizations. Finally, persons providing care to more distant
relatives and nonrelatives (e.g., friends and neighbors) likely
have a greater sense of discretion in these activities and more
flexible schedules. Caregiving provided to distant relatives and
nonrelatives provides many of the same opportunities for
volunteering but fewer of the barriers related to the often
intense emotional and time commitment provided to close
relatives. Comparing each of the five types of care recipients,
we expected that those caring for persons where social
obligation and emotional intensity are likely to be weaker
(e.g., other relatives and nonrelatives) would have a stronger
attachment to the volunteer labor force.
METHODS
Data. --In this study, we used data taken from the
Americans' Changing Lives survey (ACL; see House, 1995).
The ACL is a complex panel survey with a multistage area
probability sample design. We used the first two waves of the
survey. The baseline survey obtained information from 3,617
respondents aged 25 and older in 1986. Blacks and individuals
older than age 60 were oversampled. The second wave of the
ACL survey, taken in 1989, contains reinterviews with 2,817 of
the original respondents. Our research used two waves of these
data so that the temporally causal relationships among our
measures of caregiving and volunteer activities would be
effectively gauged. The study sample was based on middle-
aged and older respondents aged 50 and older in 1986. The
study sample was restricted to those participating in both the
1986 (T1) and 1989 (T2) interviews (N ¼ 1,615). All analyses
were based on weighted data, using the T2 person weight
provided in the ACL.

Missing values were addressed through imputation. There
were 16 missing cases on the attitudes about helping others
question that were assigned the modal category of strongly
agree. For family income, there were 158 missing cases (9.8%),
and values were imputed by the ACL survey staff using
information on mean education, marital status, home owner-
ship, and occupation.
As with most panel surveys based on a probability sample
design, selection bias due to attrition across the two waves of
the ACL may negatively impact generalizability. To account
for this possibility, we employed a two-stage sample selection
estimation technique following Heckman (1979). We predicted
inclusion in the study sample with a regression model that
included the interviewer's perception of the respondent's level
of cooperation at T1 (instrumental variable), age, number of
health conditions, and sex. This strategy yielded an estimate of
the likelihood () of inclusion in both waves of the survey. We
subsequently included a lambda term in all of the multivariate
regression analyses reported in this study. In addition, we
adjusted the standard errors of the coefficients of the regression
models for the complex sample design of the ACL by using the
interval regression (INTREG) procedure found in STATA 8.1
(StataCorp, 2003; see below). Without this adjustment, there
was a chance that the standard errors would be biased
downward, yielding misleading inferences about relationships
among affected variables.
Measurement. --Respondents to the ACL survey were asked,
``During the last 12 months, did anyone ask you to volunteer
your time?'' (yes or no). Respondents who indicated they
participated in one or more activities were also asked,
``Altogether, about how many hours did you spend on
volunteer work of (this kind/these kinds) during the last 12
months?'' We provided the amount of time spent volunteering
across all types of organizations reported in the survey in the
previous year at the median of the five original categories (see
Table 1) as 0 hr (for those who reported no volunteering in the
previous 12 months), 10 hr, 30 hr, 60 hr, 120 hr, and 200þ hr
(the ACL does not report time commitment for specific types of
activity). Our dependent variable was the number of hours
committed to volunteering observed at T2.
The key independent variables captured several dimensions
of caregiving behavior; unless otherwise noted, we took all
independent variables from T1. The ACL survey asked the
following question: ``Now I would like to talk with you about
friends and relatives who have trouble taking care of themselves
because of physical or mental illness, disability, or for some
other reason. Are you currently involved in helping someone
like this by caring for them directly or arranging for their care?''
The survey also asked respondents about their relationship to
the person they provide the most care to and the number of
hours of care provided during the last 12 months (reported in the
ACL as categories of 0, 10, 30, 60, 120 or 200þ hr; these
represent the midpoints of the original survey categories).
We defined caregiving status by a dichotomous variable: 1 ¼
caregiver, 0 ¼ not a caregiver. We measured intensity of care-
giving in time committed during the previous 12 months. We
created three dichotomous variables to measure time committed
to caregiving, where 10 to 30 hr equaled low commitment, 60 to
120 hr equaled moderate commitment, and 200þ hr equaled
high commitment (reference group is 0 hr). In Table 1, we
reported the weighted means of the midpoints of the volunteer-
ing and caregiving hours variables in Panel A and the frequency
distribution of the categories of hours committed to these
activities in Panel B. We measured caregiver's relationship to
the care recipient with five dichotomous variables: cares for
spouse, cares for a child, cares for a parent, cares for another
relative, and cares for a nonrelative (the reference group was
respondents who reported no caregiving). The survey ques-
tion referred to the person to whom the caregiver provides the
most help.
Human capital concepts were represented by indicators that
include education, measured by number of years of formal
education completed (range ¼ 0­18þ), and health, measured
with a cumulative index that summed four indicators of
limitations with activities of daily living (ADLs; range ¼ 0­4).
The ADL indicators included whether the respondent has
difficulty bathing, difficulty climbing a few flights of stairs,
difficulty walking several blocks, or difficulty doing heavy
housework such as washing walls or shoveling snow. If the
respondent indicated that they had some difficulty, a lot of
difficulty, or they could not do the activity at all, the respondent
was considered to have a limitation with this activity. We
created three dummy variables for limitations with ADLs
across the two waves: number of limitations with ADLs
increased, number of limitations with ADLs decreased, and
number of limitations remained the same (reference group).
Social capital (social network) was represented by two
measures. The first is an index of informal social activity,
combining responses from two questions relating to how often
the respondent talks with friends and neighbors and how often
she or he visits with friends and neighbors (range ¼ 0­10). The
response options were never, less than once a week, about once
a week, two or three times a week, once a day, and more than
once a day. The second measure was informal social network
size, based on a question asking respondents to give the number
of persons he or she could call on for help (``About how many
friends or relatives do you have whom you could call on for
advice or help if you needed it?''). The measure ranged from 0 to
40 (top-coded at 40 to account for extreme right-hand skew).
Following Wilson & Musick (1997), we measured helping
values (cultural capital) by the respondent's level of agreement
(strongly agree to strongly disagree) to the following statement:
``Life is not worth living if one cannot contribute to the well-
being of other people.'' The scores ranged from 1 to 4, where
a higher score indicated a higher level of agreement with this
social value.
Demographic variables included gender (1 ¼ female; 0 ¼
male), race (1 ¼ white, 0 ¼ other), marital status (1 ¼ married,
0 ¼ other), age in years (range ¼ 50­96), and age squared (to
capture the possible curvilinear impact of life cycle stage on
volunteer activity). We measured paid work activity by the
number of hours of work reported in the 12 months prior to the
interview (logged). We measured income by self-reports of
family income in the 12 months prior to the interview (given in
10 categories).
Analytic Strategy. --Our dependent variable, hours of
volunteering in the past year at T2, was truncated in that
more than 50% of the sample reported no volunteer hours.

Ordinary least squares regression techniques were not em-
ployed because this technique may yield biased results when
employed with censored data. The bias may occur because two
substantively interesting features of volunteer behavior were
captured in the dependent variable volunteer hours: (1) the
decision to volunteer, and (2) for those who choose to
volunteer, how much to volunteer. We did not assume that
the factors that predicted one part of the decision process
impacted the other part in the same way. Thus, we employed
Tobit regression techniques to estimate our models because this
approach takes into consideration the truncated nature of our
dependent variable (Maddala, 1983). We used STATA 8.1
(StataCorp, 2003) to estimate our models. Because the Tobit
regression routine does not allow for the use of weights or to
adjust the standard errors to account for clustering of cases in
the sample design, we used the INTREG procedure with the
robust error estimation and cluster options (Hardin, 2001). We
modified the interval regression method to replicate the Tobit
regression model, yielding coefficients based on weighted data
with standard errors adjusted for the complex sample design.
Tobit regression modeling techniques generate a single
coefficient predicting the underlying behavior of whether to
volunteer and how much time to commit to volunteering. This
coefficient did not provide a direct interpretation of the two
processes. Therefore, following a strategy proposed by Roncek
(1992), we decomposed the estimated coefficient into a part that
indicated the probability of volunteering and a part that indicated
the effect of the independent variables on the number of hours of
volunteering (see also Musick, Wilson, & Bynum, 2000). We
reported both the original Tobit regression coefficients and the
decomposition of the coefficient into its two constituent parts.
We estimated two types of models to evaluate the effect of
each dimension of caregiving on whether a person is a volunteer
and the number of hours volunteered. We estimated the total

CAREGIVING AND VOLUNTEERING S251
(unadjusted) effect of caregiving on volunteering by regressing
volunteer hours on three dimensions of caregiving without
controls. Next, for each dimension of caregiving, we estimated
models that included our full set of control variables, providing
estimates of the net (adjusted) effects.
RESULTS
Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the study sample.
Among those respondents in the ACL survey aged 50 and older
at first interview, 38.4% reported volunteering for a religious
or secular organization in the 12 months prior to the second
interview. Approximately one fifth of the sample (21.3%)
reported providing care or arranging for care for someone with
a disability or illness at first interview. Table 1 also provides
a breakdown for measures of caregiving, resources, and other
personal characteristics at T1 according to whether the respon-
dent was a volunteer at T2. These results show that a larger
fraction of volunteers compared to nonvolunteers provided care
to others (25.8% and 18.5%, respectively; p ¼ .001). Further,
older adults who volunteer provided more caregiving hours
than those who did not volunteer (means of categorical mid-
points, 29.3 and 20.2 hr, respectively; p ¼ .002). Readers may
wish to inspect the table for a more detailed understanding of
the sample characteristics.
Next, we have reported the results of a series of multivariate
Tobit regression models for each of the three dimensions of
caregiving. For each analysis, we reported the unstandardized
Tobit regression coefficients (and standard errors) along with
a decomposition of the coefficients that includes an estimate of
the probability of being a volunteer along with an estimate of
the number of hours of volunteering for those who were
volunteers. In Table 2, the number of volunteer hours reported
at T2 was regressed on caregiver status at T1. The unadjusted
(or total) effect shows that caregivers volunteered more hours
than noncaregivers (see Model 1). Based on the decomposition
of the unstandardized Tobit coefficient, we can see that the
probability of being a volunteer was 10.9% higher for
caregivers than noncaregivers, and caregivers reported 9.33
more hours of volunteering annually than did noncaregivers.
In Model 2, we reported the results of the full model
(adjusted or net effects). The effect of caregiver status on
volunteering remained marginally statistically significant,
with a 43% reduction in the unstandardized Tobit regression
coefficient. Net of the control variables in the model, caregivers
were 6.6% more likely to be volunteers than were non-
caregivers, and caregivers contributed 5.4 more hours of
volunteering annually than did noncaregivers. As with previous
research (see Wilson & Musick, 1997), we also found that
higher levels of human capital (education, income), social
capital (informal network activities and size), and cultural
capital (helping values) also predicted higher levels of
commitment to volunteering among middle-aged and older
adults. In general, the results presented in Table 2 supported our
expectation that caregivers would be more likely than non-
caregivers to be volunteers and volunteer more hours.
In Table 3 we have reported the results of the number of
hours of volunteer activity regressed on the number of hours of
caregiving. Contrary to our expectations, persons with modest
levels of caregiving time commitment were not more likely
than noncaregivers to be volunteers. Rather, middle-aged and
older adults who reported 200 or more hours of caregiving (the
highest amount of caregiving hours reported) were more likely
than persons reporting no caregiving hours to be volunteers and
volunteer more hours. We have presented the unadjusted effects
in Model 1, whereby persons reporting 200 or more hours of
caregiving were 12.3% more likely to be volunteers as
compared to noncaregivers, and these high-commitment care-
givers volunteer 10.5 more hours per year than noncaregivers.
We have presented the adjusted effects in Model 2. Although
the strength of the effect of caregiving hours on volunteer hours
was reduced in size, the same pattern found in Model 1
emerged. Persons reporting a higher commitment to caregiving
were more likely to be volunteers and reported more annual

In Table 4, we reported regression results estimating the

CAREGIVING AND VOLUNTEERING S253
more hours than noncaregivers. Caring for a nonrelative
showed the strongest effect; compared to noncaregivers,
persons caring for a nonrelative were 23.8% more likely to
be volunteers and reported 20.4 more hours volunteering
annually. We reported the net effects in Model 2. After entering
the demographic and resource control variables, the caregiving
effects for all but caring for a nonrelative were no longer
statistically significant. Those who provided care to a non-
relative were 18% more likely to be volunteers and volunteer
14.5 more hours than those reporting no caregiving.
If our expectations about caregivers having unique in-
formation about and opportunities for volunteering were
accurate, then we might have expected that caregivers were
asked to volunteer more than noncaregivers. We investigated
this possibility by regressing a variable describing whether
persons were asked to volunteer at T2 (yes or no) on our three
dimensions of caregiving and on our set of control variables
(logistic regression analysis; see Table 5). The results showed
support for this idea. Caregivers were more likely than
noncaregivers to be asked to volunteer. In addition, persons
committed to a modest or high level of caregiving in terms of
annual hours reported were also more likely to be asked to
volunteer than noncaregivers. Finally, persons providing care
to parents were more likely to be asked to volunteer than
noncaregivers. The remaining types of care recipients appeared
to show no relationship with being asked to volunteer.
DISCUSSION
Our analyses support the central thesis of this study that
caregivers report more volunteer activity than noncaregivers; we
found in our regression analyses that caregivers are more likely
to be volunteers than noncaregivers, and they report more hours
of volunteering. We also found that those who are most
committed to caregiving in terms of hours of care work reported
are more likely to be volunteers and report more hours of
volunteering. We expected, but did not find, a curvilinear effect,
where those providing a modest amount of care would be most
likely to be volunteers. It may be that the ACL variable for
caregiving hours, truncated at 200 or more hours, is not sensitive
enough to capture such an effect. In other words, if a continuous
measure of caregiving were available without truncation, we
may have calibrated our measures of low, modest, and high
commitments differently. Persons reporting 200 hr of caregiving
are providing, on average, about four hours of caregiving
per week. This would not be considered a high amount of
caregiving for persons who provide care to someone with
Alzheimer's disease. More research is need on this question.
Finally, caregivers of nonrelatives are more likely than
noncaregivers to be engaged in volunteering and commit more
time to volunteering. These findings are generally consistent
with the results of Farkas and Himes' (1997) study of caregiving
effects on social activity and formal voluntary association. We
did not find that spousal caregivers were less likely to be
volunteers than noncaregivers, as we had predicted. One reason
may be that spousal caregivers are older than noncaregivers (in
the ACL, the average age difference is 5.6 years). Given that
volunteering has been shown to decrease with age (however, see
Hendricks & Cutler, 2004) may explain the lack of a relationship
in our analyses. We also note that we found no interaction
effects among age and caregiver status and the other control
variables (including ADL limitations) that might further explain
volunteering behavior.
We posited that caregivers would be exposed to more
opportunities for caregiving than noncaregivers and that this
exposure would also result in caregivers being more likely to be
asked to volunteer. Our analyses support this argument as well.
A cross-tabulation of the asked to volunteer variable with the
volunteer status variable among our sample respondents shows
that 72.3% of those asked to volunteer in the last 12 months
also reported volunteering in the last 12 months. We regressed
volunteer hours on whether a person was asked to volunteer,
including controls for caregiving status, along with controls for
demographic and resource characteristics (results available
upon request). We found that those who are asked to volunteer
are more likely to volunteer than those who are not asked and
that the inclusion of the asked to volunteer variables reduces the
effect of caregiving variables to statistical nonsignificance. This
may mean that being asked to volunteer mediates the effects of
caregiver status and commitment, which is consistent with the
idea that caregivers are embedded in social networks and have
contact with organization personnel that ask them to volunteer.
However, because the asked to volunteer question in the ACL
survey was not asked at T1, we cannot be certain of the
direction of the causal relationship between volunteering and
being asked to volunteer. It is possible that persons who
volunteer are also more likely to be asked to volunteer than
nonvolunteers. A definitive analysis of this issue is beyond the
scope of this study.
It is likely that opportunities for volunteering are combined
with motivations for volunteering among caregivers. With the
ACL data, we are not able to measure specific motivations for
volunteering. We assumed that our measure of helping values is
an indirect measure of motivation to volunteer, but we do not
find any interaction effect between this general measure of
volunteering motivation and caregiver status. It may also be
that many caregivers use their social networks to get involved
in volunteer activity as a means of spending time away from
caregiving routines and the associated sense of burden or stress.

Some caregivers may find that volunteering provides a respite
from the rigors of caregiving and perhaps provides them with
a form of social support. Thus, caregivers may have self-
protective motivations that include making efforts to maintain or
improve their own physical and emotional health, while car-
rying out the challenges posed by the caregiver role. The ACL
data do not allow us to investigate this issue, but if data become
available, researchers should more closely investigate the moti-
vations for volunteering among caregivers and noncaregivers.
It is also possible that in the population of older persons there
may be a class of individuals who could be characterized as
``super-helpers'' or ``doers.'' That is, some persons have high
commitments to helping others in both the private and public
domains, and they possess the necessary resources to act on
these commitments. These people likely find the time and
energy to engage in both types of activity and are self-selected
into these activities (Thoits & Hewitt, 2001). We are unable to
measure these underlying personality characteristics with these
data and believe new data need to be collected to capture
important motivational characteristics and personality traits that
may be associated with being a super-helper. Theoretical
concepts that may help identify this class of super-helpers
would include, but are not limited to, emotional IQ, self-
efficacy, and a wide array of specific personal motivations for
helping others.
To further explore the relationship between caregiving and
volunteering, we also estimated change models of volunteer
activity (results available upon request). We included in our
model of volunteer activity at T2 a measure of volunteer status at
T1, along with the other variables reported above. Not
surprisingly, volunteer status at T1 is the strongest predictor
of volunteer hours at T2, evidence of the stability of volunteer
behavior over time. In these change models, nearly all of the
dimensions of caregiving failed to reach statistical significance.
However, after controlling for volunteer status at T1 and the
other control variables, we found that those who care for
nonrelatives report a greater number of volunteer hours at T2
than those who are not engaged in caregiving. The fact that most
of the caregiving variables do not reach statistical significance
could be a substantive finding or it could be a statistical artifact
related to the correlation among the T1 volunteer status variable
and the other T1 predictors.
To examine this issue more closely, we created a productive
activity measure at T1 with the following categories: (1) no
volunteer or caregiving activity; (2) volunteer activity; (3)
caregiver activity; and (4) caregiving and volunteer activity. We
compared this measure of productive activity at T1 with
volunteer activity at T2. An interesting hierarchy emerged.
Persons who engaged in no volunteer or caregiving activity at
T1 report about as much volunteer activity at T2 as those who
report caregiving activity only. Those who reported volunteer-
ing at T1 reported the next highest level of volunteering at T2,
and those who reported volunteering and caregiving at T1
reported the highest level of volunteering at T2. This may be
further evidence to support the idea that persons engaged in
multiple social networks (caregiving and volunteering net-
works) have the most opportunity and motivation to engage in
productive activity in later life. More research is needed to
determine how specific types of productive activity cluster
together and to determine the impacts of such clustering.
Limitations of this study include the relative age of the ACL
data. Although these are currently the best panel data available
for examining the questions posed here, it is possible that more
recent cohorts of middle-aged and older adults exhibit different
patterns of relationships among caregiving and volunteering
activities. Nevertheless, the ACL data remain valid for
hypothesis testing. While the data on caregiving in the ACL
are better than most other sources, it would be helpful to have
more detail on types of caregiving, hours committed to specific
types of caregiving, specific information on motivations for
caregiving and volunteering, along with individuals' history of
caregiving and volunteering.
