Abstract
Background: Quitting smoking improves health and drug use outcomes among people in treatment for substance
abuse. The twofold purpose of this study is to describe tobacco treatment provision across a representative sample
of U.S. facilities and to use these data to develop the brief Index of Tobacco Treatment Quality (ITTQ).
Methods: We constructed survey items based on current tobacco treatment guidelines, existing surveys, expert
input, and qualitative research. We administered the survey to a stratified sample of 405 facility administrators
selected from all 3,800 U.S. adult outpatient facilities listed in the SAMHSA Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment
Services. We constructed the ITTQ with a subset of 7 items that have the strongest clinical evidence for smoking
cessation.
Results: Most facilities (87.7%) reported that a majority of their clients were asked if they smoke cigarettes. Nearly
half of facilities (48.6%) reported that a majority of their smoking clients were advised to quit. Fewer (23.3%)
reported that a majority of their smoking clients received tobacco treatment counseling and even fewer facilities
(18.3%) reported a majority of their smoking clients were advised to use quit smoking medications. The median facility
ITTQ score was 2.57 (on a scale of 1­5) and the ITTQ displayed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .844).
Moreover, the ITTQ had substantial test-retest reliability (.856), and ordinal confirmatory factor analysis found that our
one-factor model for ITTQ fit the data very well with a CFI of 0.997 and an RMSEA of 0.042.
Conclusions: The ITTQ is a brief and reliable tool for measuring tobacco treatment quality in substance abuse
treatment facilities. Given the clear-cut room for improvement in tobacco treatment, the ITTQ could be an important
tool for quality improvement by identifying service levels, facilitating goal setting, and measuring change.

Introduction
Understanding the prevalence and quality of tobacco
treatment services for drug treatment patients should be
a public health priority. People with mental illness or
substance abuse problems consume nearly half (44%) of
all cigarettes smoked in the U.S. [1]. Drug treatment
patients are interested in quitting smoking, and quitting
smoking does not adversely affect short-term drug use
outcomes [2-15]. Indeed, quitting smoking in the first
year of drug treatment predicts better long-term
substance abuse outcomes [16].
U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) tobacco treatment
guidelines recommend that high quality, evidence-based
care include the following: a) all smokers be offered treat-
ment, b) patients unwilling to quit be provided with brief
intervention to build motivation, and c) patients willing to
quit be offered evidence-based treatment [17]. The highest
abstinence rates are achieved when pharmacotherapy is

combined with intensive counseling [18]. Office-based
intervention should follow five major steps (The "5 A's"):
Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist and Arrange follow-up. The
guidelines also recommend that office-based systems
identify, track, and follow-up with smokers at every visit
and remind providers to intervene with every smoker.
Finally, substance abuse treatment facilities should adhere
to treatment guidelines for the general population and
should incorporate new interventions, that are effective
for those in drug treatment, as new treatments become
available.
To date, the prevalence and quality of tobacco treat-
ment in drug treatment has been poorly described. In
1998 the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service
Administration's (SAMHSA's) Uniform Facility Data Set
survey found that only 20% of U.S. substance abuse
treatment facilities offered any smoking cessation
services [19]. A more recent (2001) survey of Canadian
drug abuse treatment facilities found that 54% "offered
clients help quitting smoking," but only 10% had any
formal group or individual therapy dedicated to smoking
cessation and fewer than 1% of facilities offered quit
smoking medications [20]. Friedmann et al. found that
somewhat more U.S. facilities provide formal counseling
(38%) and pharmacotherapy (17%) [21]. Walsh and
colleagues (2005) estimated that Australian substance
abuse treatment programs provide brief advice to quit to
36% of clients who smoke; education about the risks of
smoking to 39%, counseling to quit to 26%, and quit
smoking medications to 15% [22]. Knudsen and colleagues
surveyed U.S. counselors about the frequency with which
they provide five brief behavioral interventions for tobacco
use (0 = never, 5 = always); the interventions included
assessing current tobacco use, assessing past tobacco use,
advising tobacco users to quit, assessing willingness to
quit, and using brief intervention to increase motivation
to quit [23]. They found that counselors on average
provided interventions infrequently, with a mean scale
score of 2.69.
Three recent studies examined the effects of a 2008
New York State (NYS) policy change that required all
publicly funded drug treatment facilities to offer tobacco
dependence treatment to clients. In a survey of staff and
clients from a random sample of 10 programs conducted
before and one year after policy implementation,
Guydish and colleagues found that client smoking preva-
lence diminished significantly (69.4% to 62.4%) but that
implementation of tobacco treatment services differed
by facility type [24]. Clients in outpatient facilities
reported no pre-policy to post-policy change in the
amount of tobacco treatment services they received.
Those in residential treatment received less services after
the change took effect. Clients in methadone treatment
reported receiving more services post-implementation.
Eby and colleagues surveyed 147 clinicians associated
with 13 facilities immediately before and one year after
the NYS policy went into effect [25]. They found that
the manner in which the new policies were implemented
in each facility predicted staff perceptions of how fairly
the change occurred. Perceived fairness was in turn pre-
dictive of staff provision of tobacco treatment, psycho-
logical strain, and behavioral strain. Last, Brown and
colleagues summarized state records and surveyed a ran-
domly selected sample of directors of 285 facilities 3 years
before and 9­12 months after policy implementation [26].
Compared to before the policy, at post-assessment a
greater proportion of administrators reported they "always
or formally" screened clients for tobacco use; also, they
reported a greater number of tobacco services were
available for clients. State discharge data on medica-
tions administered during treatment found a significant
increase in the percentage of clients receiving nicotine
replacement therapy, from 3.0% before implementation
to 6.3% after implementation.
These studies suggest that treatment practices vary
greatly, are far from routine, and are of poor quality. For
example, although quit smoking medications are known
to double quit rates, few clinics offer or recommend them.
Moreover, no comprehensive measures of tobacco treat-
ment quality exist ­ none of the studies measured all PHS
guideline recommended elements of evidence-based care.
Only one study assessed whether facilities provided motiv-
ational interventions to unmotivated smokers [27] and
several failed to assess whether cessation medications
were recommended or provided [19,23]. Moreover, the
NYS studies suggest that policy change can increase im-
plementation of treatment services but may increase strain
on staff if implemented poorly.
Despite the low provision of tobacco treatment in drug
treatment facilities, societal trends are creating new in-
centives for treating tobacco dependence in drug treat-
ment. Staff attitudes toward nicotine dependence
treatment appear to be changing; surveys conducted in
1999 and 2000 find more staff support for helping
patients to quit smoking compared to surveys conducted
in the 1980s and early to mid 1990s [28]. In the 1990s,
changes in hospital tobacco policy, state laws, and local
ordinances forced drug abuse treatment facilities to
restrict indoor smoking and consider treating tobacco
use [29]. Major organizations now recommend incorpor-
ating tobacco treatment into addictions treatment
[30,31], and two states--New Jersey and New York--
have launched major initiatives to incorporate tobacco
treatment into drug treatment.
Research on tobacco treatment in drug treatment is in
its infancy ­ the types of services offered have not been
well described, no conceptual models for quality of care
have been developed, and measures of services and

patient outcomes are lacking. Although few programs
offer formal services, many more will likely begin to
treat nicotine dependence as external forces and patient
demand for services increases. In the absence of clear
criteria and measures of quality of care, programs may
adopt services based on cost and convenience rather
than efficacy [32]. It is important to develop a set of
measures that capture how tobacco services are deliv-
ered, evaluate these practices, and ultimately disseminate
effective practices throughout the treatment community.
The purpose of this paper is twofold: 1) to describe
tobacco treatment provision across a representative
sample of U.S. outpatient substance abuse treatment
facilities, and 2) to develop and describe a brief index
of tobacco treatment quality that assesses the extent to
which facilities provide guideline-based treatment for
tobacco dependence.
Methods
Sample
To obtain a representative sample of all current out-
patient U.S. drug treatment facilities for adults, we de-
rived our sampling frame from SAMHSA's Inventory of
Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS), a con-
tinuously updated, comprehensive listing of all known
substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States
(approximately 18,000 facilities) [33]. SAMHA's Office of
Applied Studies provided a download of descriptive data
on all facilities in the I-SATS in 2008. These descriptive
data are collected by the annual National Survey of Sub-
stance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS), which
recently had begun to collect data on whether facilities
provide nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) [34]. There
were 3,800 outpatient, adult facilities in the I-SATS sam-
ple. Based on a confidence interval of 95% and a margin
of error of 5%, we calculated we should collect data from
400 facilities to accurately describe services provided by
U.S. facilities [35]. Deriving our sample from the I-SATS
enabled us to determine the representativeness of our
final sample, because we could use descriptive data from
the N-SSATS to compare our survey sample to non-
participating facilities (see Measures and Results, below).
We stratified all 3,800 facilities by three characteristics
that have consistently been associated with the likelihood
of providing tobacco treatment services [21,29]. These
three characteristics are Ownership (profit or non-profit),
Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) provision (yes/no)
and whether or not facilities provide methadone treatment
(yes/no) (Table 1). To achieve a final sample that mirrored
the U.S. population of facilities, we pre-determined the
number of facilities required to represent each strata
within our sample (N = 400) and recruited from facilities
in each cell until all strata were filled.
Recruitment
We recruited facilities and conducted surveys between
November 2009 and November 2010.
Our study biostatistician (BG) stratified the facilities
using data from the N-SSATS. He then randomly ordered
the list of facilities within each strata and printed separate
contact lists for each strata. Research assistants mailed out
invitation letters to all facilities within each strata. The let-
ter included a number for facilities to call to either a) par-
ticipate in the study or b) opt out of the study. The letters
also noted that a trained research assistant might call a
facility at a later date to further describe the study and
personally invite facilities to participate. Two weeks after
letters were mailed a research assistant contacted facilities
to invite them to participate, collect verbal consent and
conduct surveys. Study staff called down strata lists until
each strata was filled.
One person in a leadership position (clinic director,
medical director, counseling supervisor, head nurse, or
owner) from each facility completed the survey by phone,
fax, email, or mail, according to responder preference.
Participants were reimbursed $20.00 for their time.
It would have been ideal to interview multiple staff in
each facility, or to collect data from facility treatment
records. However, resources did not permit this intensity
of data collection in enough facilities to obtain a repre-
sentative sample of U.S. facilities. There are several
national panel surveys that collect data from 1­2 per-
sons at each facility. These include the National Drug
Abuse Treatment System Survey (NDATSS), otherwise
known as the Outpatient Drug Abuse Treatment Studies
(ODATS), which collected data from a program director
interview, a clinical supervisor interview, or both [36].
Also, the National Treatment Center Study [37]
attempted to collect data from a program administrator
and a lead clinical supervisor at each participating site.
Some questions were directed at administrators, and
some at clinical supervisors, so in many instances indi-
vidual respondents were asked to report on the types
and extent of services provided across their entire faci-
lity. Last, N-SSATS collects a single survey from facil-
ities and provides a snapshot of the nature and extent
of services provided at all U.S. facilities on one given
day [38]. Hence, a number of surveys collect data
from individual representatives on the type and extent
of services provided in their facilities. We kept our
survey narrow--focused on practices related to tobacco
treatment--in order to increase the likelihood that respon-
dents could respond reliably and accurately.
To conduct the test-retest analysis, a consecutive sam-
ple of 40 survey participants were invited to take part in
a test­retest reliability sub-study of the ITTQ. Partici-
pants received an additional $20 for returning the second
survey. Test-retest was conducted over a 2- to 4-week

timeframe. The University of Kansas Medical Center Ethics
Committee (IRB# 10979) approved all study procedures.
Measures
To assess treatment provision we developed the Index of
Tobacco Treatment Quality (ITTQ) using the following
approach. First, we used as broad "domains" of treat-
ment the 5 A's from the PHS Guideline for Treating
Tobacco Use and Dependence [39]. Based on this frame-
work, we developed a broad list of items within each do-
main based on current guidelines, existing studies, and
original qualitative research conducted in facilities
[40,41]. We refined or discarded items that were not
conceptually related to each of the 5 A's. We shared our
list of measures with 10 experts in providing tobacco
treatment in drug treatment facilities, recruited from the
Association for the Treatment of Tobacco Use and
Dependence (ATTUD; www.attud.org). They rated items
in terms of their importance for treating tobacco de-
pendence and ability to discriminate between facilities
that provide high versus low quality services. We refined
the draft instrument based on expert advice, strength of
association with smoking cessation outcomes in the
general population, and other considerations such as
feasibility and survey length.
For each item, survey participants were asked "How
many of your (clients/your clients who smoke) received
. . .(name service)." Response categories were in the
form of a Likert-type scale that was anchored to the per-
centage of smokers who were provided the service. These
included Almost None (5% or fewer); Few (~25%); About
Half (~50%); Many (~75%) and Almost All (90% or more).
For example, as research assistants administered surveys,
they would read the question, then the response categories
and their associated patient percentages: "How many of
your current tobacco using clients were assessed for their
readiness to stop using tobacco? Almost None--5% or
fewer; About Half--about 50%...."
It is important to note that we opted to ask respon-
dents what proportion of their current clients who smoke
received each service, instead of how frequently the facil-
ity provided the services. The latter is the more common
method for assessing tobacco service provision--surveys
often ask providers if they "routinely" provide one of a
list of services. However, how respondents interpret
"routinely" can be highly subjective. We opted to ask re-
spondents to estimate the proportion of their current,
smoking clients that received each service in order to
guide them to anchor their response to a concrete num-
ber of clients who received services. This figure is readily
verifiable through record reviews, which a future study
could pursue to validate these measures. The Healthcare
Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) includes
measures of the percentage of smokers who were advised
to quit or to whom providers recommended medications
or quit methods in the past year [42]. In order to re-
duce recall bias, we crafted somewhat different mea-
sures that asked about treatment of current clients,
rather than clients seen in the past year. In addition,
we developed new items to collect data on additional
practices such as screening for smoking status, assess-
ment of readiness to quit, and other services.
We assessed whether facilities had a specific location in
their treatment files to record smoking status (Yes/No).
We also used a scale to assess the intensity of tobacco
treatment by assessing how often staff provide counseling
to clients to help them quit using tobacco (1 = Only
when a client specifically requests treatment; 2 = Part of
one session; 3 = An entire session; 4 = More than one ses-
sion; 5 = Four or more sessions /It is integrated into all
aspects of treatment).
To describe facility representatives completing the sur-
vey, we collected gender, smoking status, and job title.
Smoking status was assessed by the following item:
"What best describes your current tobacco use status?"
(Current regular tobacco user; former regular tobacco
user; never used tobacco regularly). We used N-SSATS
data, imported into our final database by unique
facility-level identification numbers, to describe facility
characteristics.
We selected a subset of 7 items to form the final
Index of Tobacco Treatment Quality. Six items repre-
sented the PHS guideline recommended services with
"A" level of evidence for efficacy in smoking cessation.
The 7th item was the scale of treatment intensity.
Each facility's score on all 7 items was summed and
then divided by 7 to yield a final score ranging be-
tween 1 and 5. A score of 1 represents facilities in
which almost no clients received any services and 5
represents facilities in which almost all clients received
all services.
Analyses
We compared our sample to non-participating facilities
in the U.S. to assess representativeness based on selected
variables from the 2008 N-SSATS: geographic identifiers
(urban or rural), ownership (for profit and not-for
profit), affiliation (federal agency, religious organization
or hospital), provision of nicotine replacement therapy,
availability of opioid treatment, program for DUI/DWI/
other offenders, program/group for criminal justice cli-
ents, facility size, licensure (state, mental health depart-
ment, state health department, hospital authority or
other state agency), and accreditation. We used descrip-
tive statistics to display the number and percentage of
facilities that reported that "many" to "almost all" of
their smoking clients received each service. We used the
Cupertino et al. Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2013, 8:13 Page 4 of 10
http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/8/1/13
chi-square and the Student's t-tests to examine the
significance of differences.
After selecting the 7 items that formed the final ITTQ,
we calculated test­retest reliability. To do so, intraclass
correlation coefficients (ICCs) were computed for the
two administrations of the ITTQ. We report the ICC as
a Kappa statistic for the final ITTQ and the 7 items that
comprise it, using Shrout's adjectives and cutoff values
to interpret the degree of correlation: 0.00-0.20, slight;
0.21-0.40, fair; 0.41-0.60, moderate; 0.61-0.80, substan-
tial; 0.81-1.00, almost perfect [43].
The interrelationship of ITTQ and its 7 items was ana-
lyzed by ordinal confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Or-
dinal CFA is a generalization of Rasch models [44]. The
ordinal CFA analysis was conducted by Lavaan package
version 0.5-10, from R 2.15.2 [44]. When fitting the
model, we used a one factor model and treated the re-
sponse of each item as an ordinal variable. The model fit
was evaluated by two statistical fit indexes: Comparative
Fit Index (CFI > .90) and Root Mean Square Error of
Approximation (RMSEA < .08) [45]. The composite reli-
ability was calculated with the output obtained by ordinal
confirmatory factor analysis [46]. Our interpretation of
reliability follows Shrout's guidelines (see above).
Finally, we calculated the mean, median, and standard
deviation of the ITTQ across all facilities. We computed
Cronbach's alpha to assess internal consistency of the
ITTQ [47]. To depict the distribution of scores we graphed
the frequencies of the ITTQ scores of all facilities. To fur-
ther describe the index, we summarize ITTQ scores by our
original stratification of types of facilities, as described in
Table 1. SPSS 18.0 was used for all data analyses. Statistical
significance was set at  = 0.05 for all tests.
Results
The 405 facilities within our eight strata had a similar
distribution as those found in the overall facility popula-
tion in the U.S. (Table 1). Of respondents, two-thirds
were female and approximately half (51%) were current
or former smokers. Responders held various roles in the
program; clinic directors (59%), owner (12%), head
counselor (8%), and other (21%).
Study sample versus non-participating facilities
Study facilities were similar to U.S. facilities by most
measures of comparison. Approximately half (48%) of
facilities were privately owned and only 14% provided
nicotine replacement therapy (Table 2). Most facilities in
our sample did not offer nicotine replacement therapy
nor methadone treatment. Most were not-for profit and
few (10%) were located in a hospital. Two-thirds (66%)
of the facilities had less than 100 clients. The average
number of smokers was 75% and almost a quarter of re-
spondents (23%) stated that their facility was mandated
to provide tobacco treatment. Our sample had small but
significant differences from U.S. substance abuse out-
patient treatment facilities on 4 of 18 variables. Facilities
in our sample were more likely to provide nicotine re-
placement, more likely to be rural, more likely to be cer-
tified by a mental health department, and less likely to
be certified or licensed by a state substance abuse treat-
ment facility.
Tobacco treatment services
Within our sample, most facilities (87.7%) reported that
many/almost all of their clients were asked if they smoke
cigarettes (Table 3). Nearly half (48.6%) reported that
many/almost all of their smoking clients were advised to
quit. Some (38.1%) facilities reported many/almost all of
their smoking clients were asked if they were ready to
quit. Fewer (23.3%) reported that many/almost all of
their smoking clients received tobacco treatment coun-
seling and even fewer facilities (18.3%) reported a majority
of their clients were advised to use quit smoking medica-
tions to quit. Few (24.3%) facilities routinely reported
many/almost all clients receive motivational counseling to
help them become more motivated to quit.

Most facilities (84.7%) reported they had a specific
location in their treatment files to record smoking status
(data not shown). Over half reported tobacco treatment
was provided only when a client specifically asks for it
(56%), while 15% reported it was part of one session for
most clients, 3% reported that it was an entire session
for most clients, 9% reported that it was provided in
more than one session, and 17% reported that it was
provided in four or more sessions or that it was inte-
grated into all aspects of treatment for most clients (data

skewed to the right. For this reason, the median score
(2.57) is a better summary of the overall trend in the
data. Cronbach's alpha for the ITTQ was .844, indicating
good internal consistency between index items. The ITTQ
score exhibited marked differences by facility type
(Table 4). Nonprofit facilities that offered NRT and metha-
done treatment had the highest mean ITTQ score (3.98).
For-profit facilities that offered neither NRT nor metha-
done treatment had the lowest mean ITTQ score (2.40).
Discussion
The ITTQ is a brief and reliable tool for measuring tobacco
treatment quality in substance abuse treatment facilities. It
has very good test-retest reliability. Moreover, ordinal CFA
found the ITTQ score is a good summary of each facility's
standing on 7 evidence-based treatment practices. It is
sensitive to high as well as low levels of tobacco treatment,
and discriminates between different types of facilities. Our
development sample was representative of most U.S. drug
treatment facilities, which lends confidence to the use of
the ITTQ as a benchmark for tracking the prevalence and
quality of treatment provision in the future. Descriptive
data from the survey suggest that most facilities identify
smokers but do not provide evidence-based tobacco
treatment.
Findings from our overall survey accord with prior stud-
ies. The great majority of facilities routinely collect smok-
ing status, many facilities provide brief advice to quit,
some provide counseling, but few provide or recommend
medications for quitting smoking [2-9,11-16,20-22,27]. It
is important to note that our sample was, compared to
facilities not participating in our survey, more likely to
provide NRT. Although the difference was not large (6.3%
versus 14.4%), it was significant and suggests that our
sample may be somewhat more predisposed toward pro-
viding tobacco treatment, and the real prevalence of
services is somewhat lower. The overall low prevalence of
medication use in facilities may be due to the fact that
many drug treatment facilities do not have prescribers on
staff, counseling staff do not have the license to prescribe
medications, and staff in traditionally "chemical free" facil-
ities might be reluctant to recommend any form of medi-
cation, even over-the-counter aids.
The ITTQ could be a useful tool for quality improve-
ment. It should, however, be subjected to validation
against clinical records and patient reports to ensure it
measures the true level of service provision. Moreover, it
should be evaluated before and after clinical practice
changes to assess its sensitivity to changes in the quan-
tity and quality of services provided. Should it prove to
be valid and sensitive, individual facilities or groups of
facilities could use the ITTQ to identify their current
quality score and set goals for quality improvement. Be-
cause the response categories are anchored to the num-
ber of clients receiving services, it could be converted to
a chart-based survey, in which measures are derived
from treatment data as opposed to self-report. This fea-
ture would be useful in settings that use paper or elec-
tronic health records [48], the latter of which could be
designed to collect these measures and generate auto-
matic reports. Because the current median ITTQ score
is below the mid-range of the scale, it is likely the ITTQ
will be able to detect increasing rates of treatment
provision as facilities adopt new treatment practices.
Study limitations include factors common to survey
research. The sample included only outpatient facilities
and findings may not be applicable to inpatient facilities.
Our facility sample differed significantly from non-
responding clinics on 4/18 facility characteristics, which
indicates our sample was somewhat different from all
adult outpatient facilities. The most important of these
differences was the relatively higher prevalence of NRT
provision among sample facilities, which suggests that
our findings may be somewhat optimistic in terms of the
level of tobacco treatment. We asked one person to
respond on behalf of each facility: the findings' accuracy
depends on how familiar respondents were with facility

services. Respondents included only owners or top-level
administrators: counselors and supervisors, as frontline
workers, may have different perspectives on the extent
of tobacco cessation treatment. Our surveys were self-
report and hence subject to social desirability bias. To
assess the validity of the ITTQ, future studies should
validate it against clinical records or other forms of
treatment documentation.
The study also had several strengths. Our sample size
was robust. By using a sampling frame linked to facility
characteristics supplied by SAMHSA, we were able to
compare our sample with non-participating facilities.
We constructed our survey based on treatment guide-
lines, existing surveys, and expert advice. Hence the sur-
vey was designed to have content validity, as it measured
aspects of care supported by evidence-based treatment
guidelines. Moreover, it was judged to have face validity
by our team of experts. The final instrument included all
recommended elements of evidence-based tobacco treat-
ment. Response categories were anchored to numbers of
clients treated and may represent closer estimates of
actual provider behavior compared to prior surveys.
Last, test-retest and ordinal CFA suggest the survey is
reliable and a good summary score for facility perform-
ance of evidence based tobacco treatment. The ITTQ
discriminated between our different strata of facilities
and confirmed the findings of other studies--which sug-
gests it is not only a brief and but also a valid measure
of tobacco treatment.
Conclusions
Offering tobacco treatment to drug treatment clients
could enhance treatment outcomes and reduce long-term
morbidity and mortality. Brief and valid indices such as
the ITTQ are important tools for quality assessment and
quality improvement. Should comparisons with treatment
charts and patient reports of services further validate the
ITTQ, it could serve as an outcome measure for interven-
tion trials designed to enhance adoption of tobacco treat-
ment in drug treatment facilities.
