The percentage of college students who report experiencing
psychological distress, depression, and anxiety has greatly
increased over the past decade (Burris et al., 2009;
Eisenberg et al., 2013; Roberts and Danoff-Burg, 2010). In
a recent survey (American College Health Association,
2015), 30percent of students reported that stress and 21per-
cent reported that sleep difficulties negatively impacted
their academic performance (e.g. lower grade or dropped
courses). Furthermore, many college students regularly
engage in unhealthy behaviors, placing them at risk for
developing serious health problems later in life (Heller and
Sarmiento, 2016; Hopper and Moninger, 2017; Scott-
Sheldon et al., 2008; Tran et al., 2017; Turner and Shu,
2004). However, in a longitudinal study examining positive
well-being and health outcomes, Hoyt et al. (2012) reported
that positive well-being during adolescence predicted fewer
risky health behaviors in young adulthood. Given the above
findings, the assessment and promotion of wellness within
the undergraduate student population are imperatives.
One of the overarching goals of the Healthy Campus
2020 initiative is to promote quality of life, healthy devel-
opment, and positive health behaviors on college campuses
(US Department of Health and Human Services, 2012).
Furthermore, promoting wellness within academia reduces
disease frequency and enhances both mental and physical
health (Miller et al., 2008; Slavin et al., 2014). Moreover,
wellness behaviors can be learned. Once internalized by the
individual, holistic wellness can reduce issues related to
somatization, psychoticism, and interpersonal sensitivity
(Chandler et al., 2001).

Abstract
Promoting wellness within academia reduces disease frequency and enhances overall health. This study examined
wellness factors among undergraduate students attending a research university (n
=
85) or a small liberal arts college
(n=126). Participants were administered surveys which measured physical, emotional, social, intellectual, and occupational
wellness. Significant institutional differences emerged on measures of physical and social wellness. When collapsed across
academic institutions, students who were gainfully employed reported greater self-efficacy compared with unemployed
students. Gender differences emerged on measures of physical and social well-being. Our findings support the need for
targeted interventions that facilitate enhanced college student development and well-being.

assist in student success and retention plays a vital role in
the overall success of a given college or research univer-
sity. We posit that holistic wellness contributes to student
success, and the cultivation of wellness is a valuable insti-
tutional commodity.
Wellness concept
Wellness, as a concept, captures in many ways the broader
definition of health. The World Health Organization (1948)
redefined health to be a complete state of physical, mental,
and social well-being, and not merely the absence of dis-
ease and infirmity. Shortly after, Dunn (1961) coined the
phrase "high-level-wellness" to refer to a state of optimal
health that included, a zest for life, sense of meaning and
purpose, sense of social responsibility, developing ways to
maximize an individual's potential for well-being, and
acquiring skills for adapting to the challenges of a changing
environment.
Over the years, wellness has been conceptualized as a
multidimensional phenomenon (Keyes, 2009; Miller and
Foster, 2010; Myers et al., 2000; Myers and Sweeney,
2004). For example, Ryff (1989) posits the multidimen-
sional model of psychological well-being, which comprises
six distinct components. These include autonomy, environ-
mental mastery, personal growth, purpose in life, positive
relations with others, and self-acceptance. However, this
model fails to incorporate the physical aspects of wellness
and thus limiting usefulness in addressing wellness as a
whole (Degges-White et al., 2003).
In this study, we used Hettler's (1984) model of holistic
wellness. This model was developed to promote wellness in
university and community settings. It has been used to
modify health behaviors in college students (Gieck and
Olsen, 2007) and enhance prevention and treatment of dia-
betes (Klepac, 1996). Holistic wellness consists of six
broad dimensions of health-related behaviors: Physical
Wellness (e.g. diet, exercise, sleep, smoking, alcohol use,
and personal hygiene), Emotional Wellness (e.g. self-iden-
tity and self-esteem), Spiritual Wellness (e.g. sense of peace
and connectedness with the universe), Social Wellness (e.g.
sense of community and social support), Occupational
Wellness (e.g. job satisfaction), and Intellectual Wellness
(e.g. creative stimulating mental activities).
According to Hettler (1984), a person who strives for
holistic wellness is one who is aware of all aspects of well-
ness and consciously works to incorporate these elements
into one's daily life. In other words, the pursuit of wellness
is a lifelong endeavor, and educational facilities are ideal
settings for wellness promotion (Harrington, 2016; Miller
et al., 2008). Regardless of the number of wellness dimen-
sions, researchers agree that wellness is a multidimensional,
positive, and affirming concept that has enormous practical
and therapeutic benefits (e.g. Harrington, 2016; Hattie et al.,
2004; Horton and Snyder, 2009; Meiselman, 2016).
Liberal arts and research institutions
Historically, small liberal arts colleges have proclaimed a
distinctive mission by providing students with an educa-
tional experience which fosters intellectual openness,
learning for their own sake, high-quality teaching, smaller
class sizes, and frequent student­student and student­fac-
ulty interactions both in and out of the classroom (Bovillian
and Murphy, 2013; Hanson et al., 2012; Pascarella et al.,
2004; Seifert et al., 2008). A growing body of research in
higher education suggests that students attending a small,
private, liberal arts college are more likely to experience
good practices in undergraduate education (e.g. effective
teaching, active learning, and high academic expectations)
compared to students attending other academic institutions
(Hu and Kuh, 2003; Koblik and Graubard, 2000; Seifert
et al., 2008). For example, liberal arts colleges were the
first institutional type to implement Chickering and
Gamson (1987) Good Practices in Undergraduate
Teaching Model. This model identifies seven principles for
good practices in undergraduate teaching (e.g. active learn-
ing, respect for diversity, student­faculty contact, and high
academic expectations). Seifert et al. (2010) recently
examined the degree to which first year undergraduate stu-
dents attending a college (2 or 4years) or a research uni-
versity experienced these principles. For the most part, the
experiences were similar, except for two principle out-
comes: (1) good teaching and high-quality interaction with
faculty and (2) academic challenge and high expectations.
Moreover, they found that students who were less prepared
for college (e.g. lower levels of parental education, aca-
demic motivation, and involvement in high school activi-
ties) tended to benefit the most from a liberal arts education.
Although the findings are somewhat encouraging, this
study did not assess other measures of student success
such as emotional well-being.
Research universities, on the other hand, articulate a
mission statement to discover, preserve, and disseminate
knowledge as well as advance scientific and technological
research (Jacobs and Hyman, 2010). As a result, undergrad-
uate students are presented with a plethora of research
opportunities which have been linked to increased confi-
dence and awareness, increased cumulative grade point
average, increased anticipation of a PhD, and clarification
of interest in science, technology, engineering, and math
(STEM) careers (Jones et al., 2010; Russell, et al., 2007;
Walkington, 2015). Students and alumni surveyed at a
research institution reported that working collaboratively
with peers and faculty mentors engaged in research was
important for developing skills and increasing their aca-
demic confidence (Levis-Fitzgerald and Denson, 2005).
Similarly, Gilmore et al. (2015) recently investigated the
associations between undergraduate research experiences
and research skill performance, autonomy, collaboration,
and motivation at the graduate school-level. They found the
Baldwin et al. 3
undergraduate research experience (e.g. design, data col-
lection, and analyses) was associated with heightened grad-
uate school performance in all research skills assessed.
However, the examination of wellness factors as a measure
of student success was not assessed.
Purpose of this study
Both research and liberal arts academic institutions are
devoted to developing teachers, scholars, and other profes-
sionals capable of achieving and contributing to society-at-
large. Despite these noble similarities, it is unclear how
these academic institutions compare on measures of holis-
tic wellness. Research suggests that wellness has a lifelong
effect on academic, business, and individual success (Dolan
et al., 2008; Gieck and Olsen, 2007; Horton and Snyder,
2009). According to Helliwell and Putnam (2004), the ulti-
mate dependent variable is human well-being, and all other
outcomes derive their importance. The primary purpose of
this study was to examine differences in reported wellness
in undergraduate college students attending a land grant
research university or a small liberal arts college with a
teaching mandate. To our knowledge, this is the first study
to examine wellness within this context. Although this is a
preliminary study, we expect differences to emerge between
the two academic institutions.
Methods
Sample
A total of 211 undergraduate students attending a research
university (n
=
85) or a small, private liberal arts college
(n=126) located in the southeast participated in this study.
Participants were recruited using word of mouth, and the
majority of the participants were psychology majors. A
total of 63percent of the participants were female (n=132),
and the mean age was 22.4
years (standard deviation
(SD)
=
5.16). Of these, 87
percent identified as Caucasian,
7.1percent as African American, 1.4percent as Hispanic or
Latino, 1percent as Asian American, and 3.3percent as bi-
racial. The majority of the participants were upperclassmen
(96%), and 57.1percent of the participants were employed.
Sample characteristics as a function of institution type are
presented in Table 1.
Measures
Demographic survey.We assessed all demographic varia-
bles (e.g. age, race, sex, and employment) using single
items, which allowed participants to select from a variety of
response options. Our wellness measures are as follows:
Physical Wellness--Health Behaviors. Diet and exercise
were assessed using the modified Health Behavior
Profile (Rice, 1992). This instrument consists of 14-
items, and participants were asked to indicate how accu-
rately each item describes their health habits. Responses
range from 1 (never) to 5 (daily). High scores suggest
that diet and exercise habits are fairly good. For this
study, Cronbach's alpha was .83.
Emotional Wellness--The Perceived Stress Scale. This
scale (Cohen et al., 1983) was used to assess global non-
specific stress levels during the last month. This survey
comprised 14- items, of which 7 are positively formu-
lated (e.g. In the last month, how often have you felt
things are going your way?) and 7- items which are nega-
tively formulated (e.g. In the last month, how often have
you felt that you were unable to control the important
things in your life?). This is a widely used instrument,
and higher scores indicate greater stress levels.
Resilient coping.Coping was measured using the Brief
Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS; Sinclair and Wallston,
2004). This is a four-item survey that was designed to
measure an individual's tendency to cope with stress in a
positively adaptive manner. Participants were prompted to
consider how well the items describe their behavior (e.g. I
believe I can grow in positive ways by dealing with diffi-
cult situations) on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1
(does not describe you at all) to 5 (it describes you very
well). Convergent validity was demonstrated on measures
of personal coping resources and psychological well-being
in two samples of rheumatoid arthritis patients. Cronbach's
alpha for this study met minimal standards (.70).
The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. This scale
(Rosenberg, 1965) assessed global feelings of self-
worth or self-acceptance. This is a 10-item scale, and it
is one of the most well used measures to assess self-
esteem (Blascovich and Tomaka, 1991). It is rated on a
4-point scale from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly
disagree). Scores lower than 15 are considered indica-
tive of low self-esteem. This instrument reportedly has

good test­retest reliability according to Fleming and
Courtney (1984).
Social Wellness--Need to Belong. This scale assesses
the degree to which respondents desire to be accepted by
others, seek opportunities to belong to social groups,
and react negatively when they are shunned, rejected, or
ostracized (Leary et al., 2005). This is a 10-item scale,
and participants responded on a 5-point scale ranging
from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Higher
scores indicate a greater need to belong. In this study,
Cronbach's alpha was .92.
Intellectual Wellness--Self-Efficacy. The New General
Self-Efficacy Scale (Chen et al., 2001) was used to
measure an individual's belief in their ability to meet
task demands in a broad array of contexts. This is a short
scale (eight items), and responses are based on a 5-point
Likert scale where scores range from strongly disagree
to strongly agree. High scores indicate higher general
self-efficacy levels. According to Chen et al. (2001,
2004), the psychometric evidence for this measure is
positive. Cronbach's alpha was .88 in this study.
Occupational Wellness. For this wellness measure, par-
ticipants were asked about their job status. Participants
responded with yes or no to job status items such as full-
time, part-time, or unemployed.
Procedure and data analyses
After obtaining informed consent, the survey package was
administered during regular class time. All participants
received extra credit, and this study was approved by both
schools' institutional review boards. The data were col-
lected during the 2014­2015 academic year. All data were
analyzed using SPSS version 21 (Cary, NC). To determine
the differences between groups (e.g. institution type or
demographic variables), analysis of variance (ANOVA) or
chi-square was computed. To determine significant predic-
tors of wellness, a standard multiple regression analysis
was utilized. Effect sizes were also calculated where appro-
priate, and the alpha level was set at .05. Due to the poor
psychometric properties for the measure of spiritual well-
ness, these data were not included in the current analyses.
Results
From a demographics perspective, we found no signifi-
cant differences in age, F(1, 209)=.65, p>.05, or employ-
ment status, (1)=1.45, p
=
.23, between the two
institutions. However, significant gender, 2(1)=16.17,
p=.000, and ethnic, 2(1)=7.25, p=.007, differences
were found. The liberal arts group had a greater number
of male and minority participants than the research insti-
tution group (see Table 1).
Table 2 presents the means and standard deviations for
the study variables as a function of institution type. The
one-way ANOVA revealed significant differences in
reported levels of physical activity, F(1, 209) 21.37, p<.01;
d
=
.66, overall health behaviors F(1, 209) 9.28, p<.01;
d=.44, and belongingness F(1, 209) 6.42, p<0.001; d=.36.
Participants enrolled at the small liberal arts college
reported higher physical activity levels and endorsed more
health-related behaviors than college students attending the
research institution. Moreover, students attending the
research university reported a greater need to belong than
their liberal arts counterparts. Collectively, the effect sizes
for the analyses suggest a moderate effect.
When collapsed across academic institutions, employ-
ment status as a measure of occupational wellness and
gender differences were found. With regard to employ-
ment status, students who were gainfully employed
reported greater self-efficacy, F(1, 209) 3.98, p=.04;
d
=
.27, and endorsed a higher need for acceptance and
belongingness than unemployed students F(1, 209) 3.74,
p=.05; d
=
.26. However, employed college students
reported less physical activity than their unemployed
counterparts, F(1, 209) 4.87, p=.02; d=.30 (see Table 3).
As expected, female students reported reduced physical
activity levels, F(1, 209) 17.66, p=.00; d=.58, engaging
in less overall health-related behaviors, F(1, 209) 9.12,
p=.00; d=.42, and endorsed a greater need to belong, F(1,
209) 14.77, p=.00; d
=
.55, than their male counterparts
(see Table 4). Collectively, the effect sizes for the analyses
suggest a moderate effect.
We performed multiple regression analyses for the two
wellness variables which were found to be significantly dif-
ferent between the two institutions. Both regression models
had significant predictive powers: physical well-being,
R2=11.8percent, F(5, 205)=5.49, p<.001, and social well-
being, R2=11.7percent, F(5, 205)=5.42, p<.001. In pre-
dicting participants physical well-being (total score on
health behavior scale), only self-esteem was a significant
predictor (=.304, p<.001), and it accounted for 12percent
of the variance. In predicting participants social well-being,

Discussion
In this study, we examined levels of holistic wellness
between college students attending a research university
and a small liberal arts college. Our results revealed few
differences on measures of wellness; however, two signifi-
cant differences did emerge from this cross-sectional
design. First, students attending the small liberal arts col-
lege self-reported being more physically activity and subse-
quently, endorsed more overall health behaviors than their
research university counterparts. It is plausible that these
differences are due, in part, to gender effects. There were
significantly more males in the liberal arts group, and the
overrepresentation of females in the research group may
have contributed to these differences. Research shows that
physical activity levels are higher among men than women
(e.g. Monin et al., 2015; National Center for Health
Statistics, 2011). For example, Taliaferro et al. (2009)
examined the association between physical activity and
psychological well-being in college students. They found
men were more likely than were women to participate in
aerobic activity on a weekly basis. Indeed, when
you collapse across academic institutions, males reported a
significantly higher level of physical activity in this study.
Furthermore, we found no significant differences between
the groups (institutional type or gender) with regard to diet.
The above findings may also reflect a differential approach
to stress management. Theory explaining gender-socialized
behaviors has long placed instrumental traits (e.g. assertive
and independent) in the men's domain and expressive traits
(e.g. dependence and care-focused) in the women's domain
(Bem, 1985; Grusec and Hastings, 2015; Shifren et al., 2003).
Men may show their assertive behavior through action such
as increased physical activity. However, women may demon-
strate their expressive behavior through dependence on social
relationships and increased belonging needs.Although instru-
mental and expressive trait behaviors are associated with ste-
reotypical gender roles, some research suggests that men and
women during emerging adulthood may utilize both traits
when making decisions about health-related behaviors
(Shifren et al., 2003). Young people identifying with the
androgynous trait category may report greater physical activ-
ity than those identifying with feminine traits. Additionally,
Sieverding et al. (2005) suggested that instrumental self-
concept may play a role in college students' response selec-
tions to stressors. Activity choices about management of
stress in the college population are likely to be biased toward
those traits most reinforced during early development.
Second, students attending the research university reported
a higher reliance upon social acceptance (need to belong)
compared with their liberal arts counterparts. According to
Baumeister and Leary (1995), the need to belong is a funda-
mental human motive that reflects an individual's subjective
sense of connectedness with family, friends, and social mem-
berships. More importantly, a high need to belong reflects a
heightened motivation to be accepted by others and avoid
being shunned. Again, it is plausible that this difference
between the academic institutions is due, in part, to gender
issues. In this study, the research group was overwhelmingly
female. Indeed, when you collapse across institutional types,
women endorsed a significantly higher need to belong than
men. Our finding is consistent with previous research regard-
ing gender difference with respect to belongingness or con-
nectedness (e.g. Baumeister and Sommer, 1997; Good et al.,
2012; Greenwood et al., 2013; Lee and Robbins, 2000;
Townsend and McWhirter, 2005).
It is also plausible that a large research institution provides
more opportunities for satisfying this fundamental need for
acceptance and belonging. According to Tinto's (1987) aca-
demic and social integration model of college student attri-
tion, the need to belong is an important non-cognitive variable
that is strongly related to academic success.
Therefore, individuals with a heightened inclusion need
may be drawn to a research university as opposed to a
smaller liberal arts college. Indeed, further studies are war-
ranted to ferret out these findings. In this current investiga-
tion, we found that students who were gainfully employed

reported greater self-efficacy and belongingness compared
with their unemployed counterparts. Our findings are not
surprising, and they are in line with previous research on
the benefits of employment on well-being (Boreham et al.,
2016; Dolan et al., 2008; Modini et al., 2016; Myers et al.,
2000). According to Warr (1994), employment is associ-
ated with many positive benefits such as income, interper-
sonal contact, opportunity for control, opportunity for skill
use, and valued social position, just to name a few. We also
found that employed students engaged in less physical
activity than their unemployed counterparts. Working,
while attending college, is very demanding. Furthermore, it
may be difficult to squeeze in an exercise time or a healthy
meal under these time constraints. For college students,
common barriers to exercise include other priorities,
fatigue, no motivation, and lack of time (Ebben and
Brudzynski, 2008; Greaney et al., 2009; Kulavic et al.,
2013). However, Bhochhibhoya et al. (2014) found college
students who reported higher levels of physical activity
also scored higher on measures of emotional intelligence
and mental health. Clearly, our single-item measure does
not capture completely the construct of occupational well-
ness; further studies are warranted.
Finally, this study found self-esteem to be the best pre-
dictor of physical well-being, and perceived stress was the
best predictor of social well-being. Self-esteem refers to the
value we place on aspects of our self. Research shows that
physical activity tends to positively influence our self-per-
ception and consequently our self-esteem (Ahmed et al.,
2017; Awick et al., 2017; Moore et al., 2011). For example,
Schmalz et al. (2007) found higher physical activity early in
life predicted higher self-esteem later in life in non-Hispanic
girls. Likewise, a sense of belonging is a fundamental need
that is often satisfied via friendships, social activities, and
close relationships (Baumeister and Leary, 1995). A stu-
dent's sense of belonging is an important factor associated
with academic success (Freeman et al., 2007; Good et al.,
2012; Lam et al., 2015; Tinto, 1987). The college environ-
ment provides a myriad of opportunities for strengthening
social ties and thereby satisfies this universal need to belong.
It is not surprising that college students with a strong need to
belong would seek out many of these membership opportu-
nities (academic and/or social). Consequently, membership
in too many organizations can lead to increased demands
upon one's time and energy. This increase in workload, in
the absences of resources, can produce feelings of stress and
burnout (Bakker et al., 2007; Schaufeli and Bakker, 2004).
Future studies should examine the relationship between
holistic wellness and membership in professional and social
organizations among college students.
Limitations
Despite the relative strengths of this study, there are also
limitations to consider. Our sampling method was
nonrandom and may not be representative of colleges and
universities in other parts of the country. In addition, this
study was cross-sectional which eliminates cause and effect
interpretations regarding the variables of interest. Moreover,
our college student sample lacked diversity (e.g. ethnicity,
gender, geographical region, and sexual minority). This
prevented the inclusion of ethnicity and gender in inter-
group analyses. For example, Spurgeon (2009) found Black
males attending a historically black colleges and university
(HBCU) scored significantly higher on wellness dimen-
sions of friendship, love, sense of control, and gender iden-
tity compared to Black males attending the predominantly
white institution (PWI). It is important that future studies
recruit larger samples of males and minorities to examine
critical differences in wellness components as a function of
academic institutions. Our study did not examine wellness
dimensions in students attending a community college. The
inclusion of a community college group would provide a
more complete examination of college student wellness.
Likewise, employment status is an objective index of occu-
pational wellness. However, this single item does not cap-
ture the construct in its entirety. Future studies should
incorporate broader measures of wellness (e.g. spirituality)
and correlate these self-reported measures with actual
observable wellness behaviors.
Conclusion
The foundation for lifelong wellness is laid during the col-
lege years in which young adults learn to balance academic,
financial, social, and health-related demands indepen-
dently. The degree to which an individual can balance suc-
cessfully these life challenges is a direct reflection of their
level of wellness. Our findings highlight aspects of well-
ness which are a source of concern for both types of aca-
demic institutions. Although liberal arts colleges and
research universities provide their students with wellness
information via a stand-alone wellness center, classroom
instructions, and/or website, the message may not be reach-
ing the intended audience.
