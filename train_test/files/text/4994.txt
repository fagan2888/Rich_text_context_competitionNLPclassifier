Introduction
The Medical Home
In the United States, approximately 15% of all children and
youth have special health care needs according to the 2009-
2010 National Survey of Children With Special Health Care
Needs (n.d.). As elucidated by Newacheck et al. (1998), the
Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) identifies chil-
dren and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN) as
those with a "chronic physical, developmental, behavioral or
emotional condition" who require "health and related ser-
vices of a type or amount beyond that required by children
generally." According to Liptak et al. (2006) and Damiano,
Momany, Tyler, Penziner, and Lobas (2006), Medical care
for CYSHCN represents a portion of the top 10% of health
care costs among children, which in turn accounts for 54% of
all pediatric health care costs. Yet, in many ways, the social
and emotional challenges associated with the care of
CYSHCN are of paramount concern; the issues CYSHCN
and their families face are at times complex and overwhelm-
ing. As a result, patients with chronic conditions can foster
time-intensive primary care visits.
Strickland et al. (2004) define the medical home as a
framework of health care delivery designed to improve the
quality of care received by this vulnerable subset of children.
In many ways, this model is the highest standard of care for
CYSHCN, incorporating elements of care coordination,
family-centered care, and comprehensive health assessments
(Sia et al., 2004). First introduced by the American Academy
of Pediatrics (AAP) in 1967 as a central repository for chil-
dren's medical records, the medical home has evolved over
time, and its core tenets are contained in the Affordable Care
Act (American Academy of Pediatrics, Council on Pediatric
Practice, 1967; Patient Protection and Affordable CareAct of
2010).
In a 2007 joint statement by both pediatric and adult
physicians, seven core principles of a patient-centered
medical home (PC-MH) were identified (AmericanAcademy
of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics,

Abstract
The Center for children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN) at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children in
Philadelphia is one such model and has grown steadily over the last 10 years. The medical home model embraced by the
Center for CYSHCN focuses on care coordination, patient- and family-centered care, and integrated communication tools
(such as care plans and medical summaries). The vast majority of CYSHCN treated at the Center during this study ranged
in age from 6 to 12 years. Of those children, 82% had public insurance, 17% required home-nursing services, 24% required
mobility aids, and 16% required enteral nutritional/feeding tubes. The most common diagnoses included developmental delay,
intellectual disability, and cerebral palsy. When compared with CYSHCN enrolled in a statewide medical home program, the
severity of the medical conditions of CYSHCN cared for at the Center was statistically significantly higher/more complex.

American College of Physicians, American Osteopathic
Association, 2007). According to this statement, a PC-MH
includes (a) a personal physician, (b) a physician-directed
practice team, (c) care addressing all life stages, (d) care
coordination across multiple systems, (e) appropriate pay-
ment, (f) safe, high-quality care, and (g) enhanced access to
comprehensive care.
While chronic condition management is more often
described in the adult literature, it is paramount to acknowl-
edge that the pediatric and adult medical home landscapes
both converge and diverge in their delivery models (Wagner
et al., 2001). Stille (2010) identifies the "Five Ds" that distin-
guish the pediatric from the adult medical home. They
include (a) developmental trajectory, (b) dependency on
adults, (c) differential epidemiology of chronic disease, (d)
demographic patterns of poverty and diversity, and (e) over-
all dollars spent on children versus adults. The pediatric
medical home has a long history, and recent literature sug-
gests that this model of care delivery has a favorable impact
on patient outcomes, health care utilization, and family-cen-
tered care (Advisory Committee, American Academy of
Pediatrics' Medical Home Initiative for Children With
Special Health Care Needs, 2002; American Academy of
Pediatrics, Council on Pediatric Practice, 1967; Cooley,
McAllister, Sherrieb, & Kuhlthau, 2009; Homer et al., 2008;
McAllister, Presler, Turchi, & Antonelli, 2009; McAllister,
Sherrieb, & Cooley, 2009). The goal of this article is to elab-
orate on the merits and achievements of a pediatric medical
home in clinical practice.
Studies suggest that care delivered in the context of a pedi-
atric medical home has resulted in fewer emergency depart-
ment (ED) visits and hospitalizations while bolstering quality
of care and provider satisfaction (Advisory Committee,
American Academy of Pediatrics' Medical Home Initiative
for Children With Special Health Care Needs, 2002; Leff
et al., 2009; Reid et al., 2009; Steiner et al., 2008). Additional
studies have found that health systems constructed around
primary care yield more favorable outcomes while maintain-
ing lower expenditures (Grumbach & Bodenheimer, 2002;
Starfield, Shi, & Macinko, 2005). Furthermore, improving
the experience of care for CYSHCN and their families pro-
mulgates Berwick, Nolan, and Whittington's (2008) "Triple
Aim" for health care delivery. Berwick posits that providers
should strive to (a) improve the experience of care for patients,
(b) improve the health of populations, and (c) reduce per cap-
ita costs of health care.
Provision of care in a medical home varies between the
private and public sectors, community and children's hospi-
tals, and urban and rural regions. What is understood and
accepted is that CYSHCN utilize resources and services at a
higher rate than other children/youth, often requiring more
time with primary care providers to maintain optimal health
(Turchi, Gatto, & Antonelli, 2007). For example, according
to Vogeli et al. (2007), patients with five or more chronic
conditions may have encounters with up to 14 physicians in
one calendar year, thus warranting optimal care coordination
and communication among providers.
The Medical Home in One Urban Children's
Hospital
Primary care for CYSHCN may be delivered in a variety of
settings, including private practices, hospital-based clinics,
community health centers, and practices based in children's
hospitals. According to the Children's Hospital Association
(CHA; 2012), there are currently 47 freestanding children's
hospitals, 152 children's hospitals within a general hospital,
and 19 specialty children's hospitals in the United States
offering comprehensive care for children. There is a paucity
of literature describing the experiences of CYSHCN and
families receiving care in children's hospital-based clinics.
Often, parents/caregivers of CYSHCN seek primary and spe-
cialty care for their children at children's hospitals if geo-
graphically convenient. Some families with CYSHCN
(particularly in rural sectors) are located far from tertiary
care centers and rely on hospital-based medical homes to
receive coordinated and comprehensive care. As such, it is
critical to explore models of primary care delivery for this
fragile pediatric population in a children's hospital setting.
This article seeks to describe the experience of a primary
care practice for CYSHCN located within an urban chil-
dren's hospital.
The Center for CYSHCN at St. Christopher's Hospital for
Children in Philadelphia (an urban health care center) was
conceived by primary care physicians and staff who partici-
pated in a statewide medical home initiative (www.pamedic-
alhome.org). The Center for CYSHCN was founded in 2003
with a stated mission to provide ongoing, comprehensive,
and family-centered medical care to CYSHCN and their
families and to improve access to services, community
resources, and advocacy. It is the Center's objective to foster
opportunities for children to obtain optimal support through
life stages and achieve independence. Our study evaluated
the Center's medical home implementation over the course
of several years.
Background
Center Practices
The Center for CYSHCN branched off from a larger pri-
mary care pediatric practice to focus on the provision of
comprehensive and coordinated primary care services for
CYSHCN and their families. With an initial staff of two
pediatricians, a nurse care coordinator, and a population of
140 CYSHCN, the Center now serves more than 1,800
CYSHCN and their siblings with a team of five pediatri-
cians, one nurse practitioner, three nurse care coordinators,
two social workers, a health navigator, and four administra-
tive personnel.
Turchi et al. 3
The Center for CYSHCN embraces the medical home
model of care delivery, in which practice-based care coordi-
nation plays a central role. In a 2007 Pediatrics article on the
benefits of practice-wide care coordination, McAllister et al.
identify a method for implementing a model in which team
members outline a "vision for care, a framework of struc-
tures and processes, and a position description with specific
competencies." The goal of this first step is to test the prac-
tice's service capacity while integrating and evaluating care
coordination services. Wagner's Chronic Care Medical
Home Model (CCM) is used as a framework at the Center.
This model emphasizes the importance of community
resources that serve CYSHCN and their families (Epping-
Jordan, Pruitt, Bengoa, & Wagner, 2004). In addition, the
CCM advocates family-centered care in which proactive
care teams are omnipresent during all aspects of care
delivery.
At the Center for CYSHCN, the entire practice team is
involved in coordinating care for patients with special health
care needs. The unique aspects of each role (from front desk
attendant to physician) cannot be underestimated, and all
team members are vital in interfacing with the patient and
family (Grumbach & Bodenheimer, 2004).Acrucial member
of the Center's medical home team is the practice care coor-
dinator, whose role includes developing medical summaries
and care plans, promoting patient counseling about medical
and educational services, and increasing access to commu-
nity resources (Gupta, O'Connor, & Quezada-Gomez, 2004;
McAllister, Presler, et al., 2009). The care coordinator works
with families during hospitalization, transition from hospital
to home, outpatient specialist appointments, and home visits.
The coordinator participates in interdisciplinary meetings
with home-nursing agencies and equipment companies,
and also connects families to resources (such as Early
Intervention) and attends Individualized Education Plan
meetings. These diverse responsibilities emulate the AAP's
vision for care coordination as crossing multiple systems and
services (Council on Children With Disabilities, 2005).
Method
Data Collection and Statistical Analysis
Data collection and analysis is integral to the growth and
quality improvement at the Center. The care coordinator con-
ducts rigorous data collection on resources and health care
utilization from the first day that a patient is seen at the
Center. In examining data distribution, frequency and per-
centages of the variables were displayed, and the mean of
the Medical Home Index scores for varying services was
plotted over the course of 3 years (Cooley, McAllister,
Sherrieb, & Clark, 2003). The distribution of the overall
burden due to referrals, communication tools, admission,
and emergency visits were assessed over a 6-year period
from 2004 to 2010. Furthermore, Poisson regression using
year as a risk factor was fitted to assess the significant dif-
ference in rates and to test the linear trend(s) over the desig-
nated years. Ordinal logistic regression was used to assess
the difference in diagnostic severity levels between the
Center's CYSHCN population and patients in other medical
home practices across Pennsylvania. The above analyses
were conducted using SAS 9.2 (SAS, 2008). Data
collection efforts for this work were reviewed and approved
by the Drexel University College of Medicine's Institutional
Review Board.

dependent on technology when compared with previous esti-
mates (Palfrey et al., 1994).
As a participant in the Pennsylvania Medical Home
Initiative (PA MHI) program at the Pennsylvania Chapter of
the AAP, the Center used many aspects of evidence-based
medical home and quality improvement models (www.
pamedicalhome.org). Initially, a comprehensive patient data-
base was developed including the patient's name, date of
birth, diagnoses, insurance, race, home nursing and equip-
ment needs, and a medically determined severity score. This
severity score calculation is based on the Phoenix Severity
Scoring system developed by Dr. David Hirsch (2001). This
system allows practitioners to score the severity of a patient's
medical condition(s) (1 being the least severe and 4 being the
most severe) on organ system involvement and psychosocial
issues (designated by an "S" after the numeric score).
As shown in Figure 1, the percentage of CYSHCN with
severity scores greater than 2 was statistically significantly
higher in the Center when compared with other primary care
pediatric practices involved in the PA MHI across the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania who do not exclusively
treat CYSHCN.
Referrals, Care Plans, and Hospitalizations
Many elements of health care utilization were examined over
the course of the study. Staff tracked referrals to specialists
and the number of procedures received by the Center's popu-
lation and saw that both increased in absolute numbers with
time. As the Center's patient population expanded over a
6-year span, so too did the utilization of care coordination
documents and materials such as patient care plans and fam-
ily-collaborative medical summaries. As shown in Figure 2,
the number of referrals to community resources and mental
health providers experienced initial growth before decreas-
ing in 2010.
Figure 3 tracks the number of hospitalizations and ED
visits for CYSHCN cared for at the Center. Again, there is a
steady increase of hospitalizations and visits between 2004
and 2010 that mirrors the increase of the patient cohort at the
Center.
The Medical Home Index
The Medical Home Index was completed by all staff mem-
bers in an effort to effectively measure quality improvement
around medical home constructs. Initial index completion
provides a "needs assessment of medical homeness" of a
practice (Cooley et al., 2003). The index also affords primary
care practices the opportunity to evaluate discrete domains to
focus on and the ability to monitor progress. The Center
demonstrated statistically significant increases in index
scores over time. Results are shown in Figure 4.
Care Coordination
The Center for CYSHCN tracked individual care coordina-
tion encounters for patients over a 24-month period. More
than 18,000 care coordination encounters were tracked, rep-
resenting multiple care coordination events for some patients.
We found that 76% of all care coordination encounters con-
sisted of time spent with nurse coordinators, while the least
amount of time (1%) occurred with the treating physician.
See Figure 5 for results.
Discussion
Figure 1 demonstrates that patients at the Center are over three
times more likely to have severity scores of 2 or higher than
CYSHCN in other PA MHI practices. It can be assumed that
the Center's patient population shows a higher rate of medical
complexity due to the practice's focus on primary care provi-
sion for CYSHCN through referrals. Regardless of the etiol-
ogy of this disparity in scores, it highlights the complexity of
patients in this practice. Linking severity of diagnosis to time
spent on care coordination may help primary care practices
determine the appropriate allocation of resources, as well as
allotment of staff hours, roles, and responsibilities. It would be
worthwhile to corroborate this trend with other care maps and
scoring systems in an attempt to predict the levels of services
that CYSHCN with particular diagnoses/severity scores
might require.

found a distinct correlation between decreased length of stay
and increased surgical procedures for CYSCHN cared for in
a hospital-based primary care clinic (Berman et al., 2005).
Although our study did not examine this variable specifi-
cally, it is interesting to examine health care utilization for
fragile populations based on distance to tertiary care centers,
as few studies focus solely on hospital-based clinics.
Our evaluation of the impact of the Center's practices for
health care utilization demonstrates several interesting
trends. As mentioned previously, the overall number of
patients enrolled at the Center increased steadily over time.
The study identified an intriguing trend among ED visits and
hospitalizations over time. There was a statistically signifi-
cant increase in ED visits over a 6-year period. For hospital-
izations, there was a peak in 2009 followed by a decrease in
2010. One explanation for this finding is that by the final
year of the observation, care coordination at the Center was
institutionalized to such a degree that its multidisciplinary
benefits helped prevent unnecessary expenditures with
respect to unplanned hospitalizations. For example, some of
the CYSHCN with acute needs may have been appropriately
treated in the Center or at their specialist's office due to
increased access to care coordination services. This finding
is limited in that patient diagnosis may be a confounder.
Moreover, the data collected were not able to discern the
level of ED visits (acute vs. routine) and planned versus
unplanned hospitalizations. It is a finding that warrants
future studies that follow the same patient(s) longitudinally
to confirm our hypothesis in explaining this trend.
It is clear that there is a natural increase in the number of
referrals to specialists over time that mirrors the increase in
the absolute number of patients cared for at the Center. When
a child with special health care needs is first seen in any prac-
tice, there is often an initial increase in service utilization and
referrals to community resources as the patient is connected
with support services to maintain and improve their func-
tioning. This finding may also explain the plateau in com-
munity and mental health referrals as CYSHCN were
routinely linked to appropriate resources. Moreover, staff
turnover and training may account for some decreases.
The Medical Home Index proved to be an important self-
assessment tool. The Center demonstrated statistically sig-
nificant increases in reported scores over time, which helped
define measures of success and best practices for continued
medical home utilization. In addition, since community out-
reach and quality improvement were two of the team's

lowest initial scores, the index fostered robust efforts to
focus on these areas. Assessment of the medical home prac-
tice's increased efficacy over time is a useful exercise in
monitoring quality improvement, staff training, and practice
expansion (Homer & Baron, 2010).
The practice team is a vital component of any medical
home. Defining the roles and responsibilities of all team
members is paramount in fostering efficiency and optimal
communication(Chenetal.,2010;Grumbach&Bodenheimer,
2004). Among the Center's medical home team members, the
care coordinator spent the most time on care coordination
activities by an overwhelming margin. Having a designated
care coordinator certainly contributes to this finding. One sur-
vey of pediatricians found that the two biggest barriers to pro-
viding care coordination services were the physician's lack of
available time and an inadequate number of office staff or allo-
cated hours (Gupta et al., 2004). "Relational coordination"--an
emerging health care topic--may prove helpful in overcoming
these obstacles (McDonald et al., 2010). This level of care
coordination is defined as "a mutually reinforcing process of
interaction between communication and relationships carried
out for the purpose of task integration." Relational coordina-
tion is particularly relevant to care coordination at the Center;
the care coordination "activities" were as important as the
team (i.e., families, community partners, physicians, nurses,

mental health providers, social works) and the care coordina-

Care planning is one of the most important aspects of the
medical home framework at the Center. As outlined by
McAllister, Presler, and Cooley (2007), care planning
includes the use of an "actionable" care plan with assigned
tasks/roles, a care plan document, emergency information
form, and/or a medical summary including past medical his-
tory and salient specialist information. Practices can use
tools such as the Care Coordination Measures Atlas, devel-
oped by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality
(McDonald et al., 2010). The Atlas provides a list of activi-
ties proposed as a means of achieving coordinated care that
is organized by domains and perspectives (i.e., patient/fam-
ily, health care professional, system representative).
Conclusion
All children deserve a medical home. The subset of children
who have unique medical needs require care coordination
and, at times, services in the setting of a children's hospital.
As stated by Palfrey et al. (1994), there are limited data on
the prevalence of CYSHCN who are extremely medically
fragile (i.e., technology dependent). This small subset of
children is the focus of the primary care service delivery in
this study. Data collection strategies in a hospital-based
clinic may lend themselves to infrastructure and resource
planning.
Care coordination has been shown to not be cost prohibi-
tive in practice and essential in practice growth and the
establishment of a sustainable medical home model
(Antonelli & Antonelli, 2004). Future studies of cost benefit
analyses of services rendered (i.e., care coordination) and
health care utilization are warranted. Employing these data
in reimbursement strategies for care coordination activities is
an important next step.
Studies suggest that care coordination favorably impacts
family satisfaction while reducing barriers to care (Turchi
et al., 2009; Wood et al., 2009). Family satisfaction with care
coordination services was not evaluated in this study, but it
represents an area for future research. With the future of
health care reform and accountable care organizations, data
from hospital-based clinics and affiliates may become ple-
thoric (Joint Principles for Accountable Care Organizations,
2010).
Finally, as members of the medical community, we must
prioritize care coordination as a "critical and reimbursable
element of a medical home" while "creating rigorous, audit-
able, and broadly applicable training programs" (Turchi
et al., 2007). In this quest, we can address Berwick's "Triple
Aim" by partnering with patients and families to redesign
primary care, address population health management,
achieve solvent financial management, and integrate the sys-
tems of care for our patients (Berwick et al., 2008).
Turchi et al. 7
Limitations
The data from this study represent one children's hospital, and
thus are not generalizable to all children's hospitals. However,
this study does contribute much-needed knowledge to a limited
area of research. In addition, health care utilization analyses
were not controlled for diagnoses, severity of condition(s), or
unplanned versus planned hospitalizations. These deficits rep-
resent areas for future work and research. While the data were
collected and recorded by one staff person, recall bias is possi-
ble when considering individual care coordination encounters.
Finally, the Medical Home Index scores reflect self-reporting
from all staff in the Center. As a result, these data may over-
or underestimate the level of care coordination activity at the
Center.
