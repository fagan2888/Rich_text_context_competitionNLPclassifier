Abstract
Objectives: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder (CD), and their
influencing factors on primary school-age children.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 2045 students, 7­15 years old, who
were randomly selected from seven schools in Kayseri, Turkey, in 2012. Participants were stratified
by socioeconomic status. Data were collected using the Turgay DSM-IV-Based Child and
Adolescent Behavioural Disorders Screening and Rating Scale (T-DSM-IV-S). For statistical
analyses, the t-test and analysis of variance were used.
Results: Rates of disruptive behaviour disorders (DBDs) among children were as follows: ADHD,
6.2%; CD, 14.4%; and ODD, 6.7%. The prevalence of ADHD was higher in boys and children whose
mothers were homemakers and from poorly-educated and low-income families, compared with
their peers. CD was more prevalent among boys and children 13­15 years old, whose parents had
low income levels and were separated. ODD was higher in boys and children whose mothers were
homemakers.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the overall prevalence of DBDs in our study area is 27.4%,
which is similar to the pooled worldwide prevalence. Adverse family factors are closely associated
with the prevalence of DBDs.

Introduction
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder
defined by impairing levels of inattention,
disorganization, or hyperactivity/impulsivity
(HAI). Inattention and HAI are considered
when six or more characteristic symptoms
have persisted for at least 6 months, to a
degree that is inconsistent with developmen-
tal level and negatively impacts directly on
social and academic/occupational activities.
ADHD is assessed according to the current
level of severity, as follows. Mild: Few, if any,
symptoms in excess of those required for a
diagnosis of ADHD are present, and symp-
toms result in no more than minor impair-
ment in social or occupational functioning.
Moderate: symptoms or functional impair-
ment between ``mild'' and ``severe'' are present.
Severe: many symptoms in excess of those
required for a diagnosis of ADHD are present,
or several symptoms that are particularly
severe are present, or the symptoms result in
marked impairment in social or occupational
functioning.1 In diagnosing ADHD, there are
three sub-types: ``predominantly inattentive
type'', ``predominantly hyperactive/impulsive
type'', and ``combined type'' with characteris-
tics of the first two subtypes. The subscales of
ADHD are based on the predominating
symptoms in the last 6 months.2
Today, it is widely accepted that the effects
of mental problems experienced during child-
hood are not only limited to the periods of
childhood and puberty but they continue and
can lead to secondary problems during
adulthood.3 Population-based surveys have
reported that the prevalence ADHD is about
5% among children and 2.5% among adults
in most cultures.4 For this reason, it is
considered to be a major health problem
owing to the considerable lifelong effects of
ADHD and related disorders.5
ADHD is characterized by behavioural
disorders and difficulties during childhood
or puberty that are inappropriate for devel-
opmental age. ADHD may manifest as
antisocial personality disorders and may
adversely affect social and academic life,
social relationships, and communication.
As with any medical condition, the devel-
opment of health strategies directed toward
early diagnosis and treatment of ADHD
depends on robust epidemiological data.1
ADHD is one of the most diagnosed
and investigated disorders among chil-
dren worldwide, and its prevalence has
increased explosively in countries through-
out the world. The American Psychiatry
Association has reported that the propor-
tion of children diagnosed with ADHD in
1995 was 3­7%, and 5% of school-age
children; this rate increased to 8­12% in
2000.6,7 Similarly, meta-analyses have docu-
mented a pooled worldwide prevalence of
ADHD at 5.29% and 5.71%.4,8,9 As some
studies have pointed out, the prevalence of
ADHD ranges from as low as 1% to as high
as 20% among school-age children.4,10 The
increase in the prevalence of ADHD among
school-aged children in Turkey is similar to
the global trend, with current studies report-
ing am ADHD prevalence of about 13% in
that population.11,12 However, some studies
have observed oppositional defiant disorder
(ODD), which often accompanies ADHD,
in 46% of adolescents and 33% of chil-
dren.13,14 While the role of ADHD in
the development of disruptive behaviour
disorders (DBDs) is a controversial issue,
the relationship between ODD and ADHD
Senol et al. 123
may be an indicator of the early onset of
DBD symptoms.13,15
The differences in the reported prevalence
of DBDs among published epidemiological
studies may be the result of different meth-
odologies used (e.g., parent-, teacher-, or child-
based, strict criteria, or clinical evaluation of
impairment), sampling differences (different
age ranges, stratified cluster sampling, school
sampling, clinical sampling), different scales
applied (e.g., ICD, DSM-IV, DISC-IV, PIC-
GAS, or CBLC), and cultural differences.16
The references cited in our study may also
include these kinds of variations.
The aetiology of ADHD is not well
understood. Biologic, genetic, and environ-
mental factors have been implicated in
the development of the disorder. The rate of
inherited ADHD is between 55% and 92%.17
Ercan et al.11 explained that a high preva-
lence of ADHD in the Turkish population
(1500 cases randomly selected from 12,667
students) is related to migration and presence
of the DRD4 gene. Although some studies5,8
have reported that ADHD is seen 2­5 times
more frequently in boys than in girls, recent
studies have argued that the disorder is
present equally in both sexes. Differences
related to sex mostly show up in ADHD and
other DBDs; therefore, certain symptoms
come to the forefront, such as HAI in boys
and attention deficit (AD) in girls.6
The prevalence of ADHD also differs
according to age and socioeconomic status.
Someresearchershavestatedthatthedisorder
is most often seen among school-age chil-
dren18 and may potentially be more present
amongpopulationswithlowersocioeconomic
status.19­22 ADHD can be well-managed with
medication; however, its early diagnosis is
critical owing not only to the behavioural,
social, and psychological problems that arise
during childhood but also to the secondary
problems ADHD may cause during adult-
hood, once the disorder has become chronic.
In Turkey, there have been limited com-
prehensive, population-based studies on
ADHD and other DBDs23,12,24. Therefore,
to better plan health services and implement
strategies for detection and early interven-
tion, targeted epidemiologic data must be
obtained through population-based research
on ADHD prevalence and its associated risk
factors in Turkey. The present study aimed to
obtain the frequency of ADHD and other
DBDs and to examine the relationships with
sociodemographic factors among schoolchil-
dren aged 7­15 years old in Kayseri.
Material and methods
Participants
This cross-sectional study was conducted in
Kayseri, Turkey between February and April
2012. A multistage sampling method was
applied in the study. In the first stage, 99
primary schools were classified into sub-
groups of low, middle, and high socioeco-
nomic level, using a randomized stratified
sampling method and considering the socio-
economic level of the families of students, as
defined by the Ministry of National
Education, Provincial Directorate of Kayseri.
In the second stage, 7 of 21 socioecono-
mically similar schools were included in the
sample, with a 33% sampling rate in each
stratum, to facilitate accessibility to the
target population. The sample included
three schools classified as low socioeconomic
level (Seyrani, _
Istiklal, Sehit Jandarma
Komando Er Haci Aydinci), two as middle
socioeconomic level (Mehmet-Cemile
Ogulcuklu, Cumhuriyet), and two schools
classified as high socioeconomic level (Osman
Hilmi Kalpaklioglu, Refika Kucukcalik).
We assumed a prevalence of ADHD in
Turkey of about 20%, a confidence interval
(CI) of 95%, an alpha error of 0.05, beta
error of 0.80, and difference (d) of 2.5%. The
sample size was estimated at 2135 children,
using means of NCSS statistical software
and PASS sample size software (NCSS,
LLC, Kaysville, UT, USA). Using a
random sampling method, 2300 students
124 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
from grades 1 to 8 were selected: 605 students
from low socioeconomic level schools, 735
from middle-level schools, and 760 from
high-level schools (Figure 1).
Data collection
The data were collected using a questionnaire
comprising two parts. The first part was
related to demographic characteristics of
students (age, sex, and number of siblings)
and parents (age, marital status, education
level, average monthly income, employment
status, and family type).
The second part of data collection was
done using the Turgay DSM-IV Disruptive
Behavioural Disorders Rating Scale
(T-DSM-IV-S)25, to assess symptoms of
DBDs. The T-DSM-IV-S and demographic
data form were delivered by school adminis-
trators in a sealed envelope to the parents of
the randomly selected children. One week
later, 2045 of 2300 (response rate: 89%)
questionnaires were returned. Completed
forms were received in a sealed envelope by
the researchers from the school administrators.
The T-DSM-IV is a 4-point Likert-type
scale based on DSM-IV diagnostic criteria
for inattention, HAI, ODD, and CD. It
consists of a total 41 items, with items on the
scale being identical to the list of symptoms
defined as the DSM-IV criteria for ADHD
(AD: 9 items and HAI: 9 items), ODD
(8 items) and CD (15 items). The T-
DSM-IV-S was developed by Turgay25 in
1994 and translated and adapted for the
Turkish population by Ercan et al. in 2001.26
Symptoms are scored by estimating the
severity for each item on a 4-point Likert-
type scale, as follows (0 ¼ not at all;
1 ¼ just a little; 2 ¼ severe; 3 ¼ very severe).
For diagnosis, ratings of severe and very
severe were considered positive for each
item. To diagnose for inattention disorder,
the severity of at least 6 of 9 items should be
rated 2 or 3; and for hyperactivity/impulsiv-
ity disorder the severity of at least 6 of 9
items should be rated 2 or 3; and for
oppositional defiant disorder, at least 4 of
8 items should be rated 2 or 3; and for
conduct disorder, at least 2 of 15 items
should be rated 2 or 3. In all these cases,
symptoms should be present for 6 months to
a year. Subscale scores on the T-DSM-IV
are calculated by summing the scores for the
items of each subscale.

Statistical analysis
The data were analysed using the IBM SPSS
version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY
USA) statistical software. Total scores
and subscale scores were calculated for the
T-DSM-IV-S. The quantitative variables
were summarized as mean Æ standard devi-
ation. Scores obtained from the scale were
categorized as having symptoms of ADHD
or other DBDs or not having symptoms of
these disorders. The chi-square (2) test was
used for categorical variables to examine
associations between DBD symptoms and
sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex,
marital status, monthly income, occupation,
education level, family type) of the children
and their families. Independent groups were
compared using the Student's t-test and one-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The
results were assessed using a 95% CI and a
significance level of p < 0.05.
Results
Sociodemographic characteristics
Of the total 2045 respondents, 52.8% were
girls and 47.2% were boys, a well-balanced
sex distribution of study participants. The
average age was 10.56 (Æ2.20) years for girls
and 10.37 (Æ2.23) years for boys. A total
62.3% of students were in grades 1­5 and
37.7% were in grades 6­8. The average age
of participants' mothers and fathers was
35.96 (Æ5.53) years and 40.49 (Æ6.00) years,
respectively. The age group distribution of
participants' mothers was as follows: ages
31­38 years (52.1%), 39­46 years (26.7%),
and 23­30 years (17.2%); the lowest rate
(4%) was mothers aged 47 years and above.
The age group distribution of fathers was as
follows: ages 40­47 years (43.3%), 32­39
years (41.3%), and 48­55 years (9.3%); the
age group 56 years and above represented
only 2.1% of fathers.
The average monthly income of parents
was 1480 Æ 1131 TRY; 26.2% of parents
had monthly incomes less than the minimum
wage (740 TRY). A total 66% of monthly
incomes varied between 730­3100 TRY. The
proportion of parents with an income of
3101 TRY and above was 7.9%. Most of the
mothers (84.8%) did not work outside the
home, with only 15.1% of them working at a
job with a regular income. Among the
fathers, 51.1% were manual labourers and
43.9% were self-employed. Among all par-
ents, 96 (4.7%) were illiterate. A total 49.9%
of mothers had completed primary school
and 37% had graduated from high school
or university. For fathers, 50.5% had
completed primary school and 48.1% had
graduated high school or university. A total
82.1% of participants came from a nuclear
family, and the mean number of siblings was
2.3 Æ 1.3.
Relationship between sociodemographic
characteristics and prevalence of ADHD
and other DBD symptoms
Table 1 gives the distribution of T-DSM-
IV-S scores and sex ratios, and Table 2
shows the relationship between the preva-
lence of DBD symptoms and sociodemo-
graphic characteristics. According to
parents' statements, 6.2% of children had
both AD and HAI disorder symptoms; the
rates of symptoms of specific disorders were
41 children (2%) with AD and 85 (4.2%)
with HAI. The prevalence of ODD was
6.7% (136 participants) and 14.4% (294
participants) for CD; the overall prevalence
of DBD symptoms was 27.4%. In our study,
adverse family factors were found to be
associated with the detected DBD symp-
toms. The prevalence of AD symptoms was
significantly higher in boys (3%, p ¼ 0.002),
children whose fathers were illiterate
(10.3%, p ¼ 0.001), those whose mothers
were homemakers (2.3%, p ¼ 0.010), and
children whose family had incomes lower
than minimum wage (4.1%, p < 0.001). The
sex ratio for AD symptoms was found to be
2.4/1. Similarly, mean AD scores were also

Relationship between T-DSM-IV-S scores
and sociodemographic characteristics
Mean AD scores were significantly higher in
boys (4.87 Æ 4.65, p < 0.001), children from
low-income families (5.14 Æ 5.12, p < 0.001),
and children whose mothers (6.93 Æ 7.32,
p ¼ 0.001) and fathers (6.93 Æ 7.32,
p < 0.001) were illiterate, and were home-
makers (4.27Æ 4.33, p¼ 0.001) and manual
labourers (4.44Æ 4.49, p< 0.001), respectively.
Mean HAI scores were significantly
higher among boys (6.65 Æ 6.05, p < 0.001),
children with illiterate fathers (8.86 Æ 7.76,
p ¼ 0.002), those whose mothers were home-
makers (5.64 Æ 5.74, p ¼ 0.001), and children
from low-income families (6.22 Æ 6.35,
p < 0.001).
Similarly, mean ODD scores were signifi-
cantly higher in boys (4.38 Æ 4.14, p < 0.001),
children whose fathers were illiterate (5.17 Æ
5.23, p ¼ 0.032), those whose mothers were
homemakers (4.08Æ 4.13, p ¼ 0.004), and
children from low-income families (4.25 Æ

Mean CD scores were significantly higher
in boys (0.94 Æ 1.91, p < 0.001), children
whose mothers were homemakers (0.69 Æ
1.70, p ¼ 0.001), and children from low-
income families (0.80 Æ 1.87, p ¼ 0.005).
Based on these results, scores of subscales
and overall mean scores were signifi-
cantly higher among boys (16.86 Æ 13.62,
p < 0.001), children whose mothers
(16.67 Æ 13.64, p ¼ 0.001) and fathers were
illiterate (21.34 Æ 19.49, p < 0.001), those
whose mothers were homemakers (14.93 Æ
13.59, p ¼ 0.001), children whose fathers
were manual labourers (14.93 Æ 13.59,
p ¼ 0.004), and those from low-income
families (16.4 Æ 14.7, p < 0.001) (Table 3).
Discussion
As noted in the literature, for planning health
services and implementing strategies of detec-
tion and early intervention, it is necessary to
obtain accurate and reliable epidemiologic
data through population-based research with
large study samples in developing countries,
as is the case in Turkey. Thus, this study is
important owing to its use of parent-based
estimates to determine the prevalence of
commonly observed ADHD and other
DBD symptoms among Turkish primary
school children.
The prevalence of ADHD was 6.2% in
our study. The most common comorbid
disorders were CD (14.4%) followed by
ODD (6.7%). The rate of detected DBD
symptoms in this study (27.4%) was lower
than those reported in Chile (38.3%), Hong
Kong (38.4%), and the city of _
Izmir in
Turkey (36.7%).27 Unlike these studies, the
prevalence found in this work was higher
than that reported by Canino et al.28 from
Puerto Rico (19.8%). Differences in the
reported prevalence of DBD symptoms in
epidemiological studies may be the result of
different information sources (e.g., parent or
128 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
teacher-based, strict criteria), differences in
sampling methods (stratified cluster sam-
pling, school sampling, clinical evaluation)
and different scales applied (e.g., ICD-10,
DSM-IV)3
In our study, the ADHD prevalence rate
(6.2%) was similar to the pooled worldwide
prevalence (5.29­5.79%) for children and
adolescents.9,4 At the same time, our find-
ings are consistent with previous studies24,29
conducted among elementary school chil-
dren using parent based-estimates, which
have reported ADHD prevalence between
2.7% and 9.6%. In another study performed
in Malatya, Turkey among 3002 primary
school children, the prevalence of ADHD
was found to be 9.5%.30 The abovemen-
tioned study in _
Izmir used strict criteria and
a school sampling method, as in our study; a
prevalence of ADHD of 21.8% was found in
that city.27
In our study, the prevalence of ODD was
found to be 6.7%, which was higher than the
worldwide pooled prevalence.28 Various
studies in Turkey have reported ODD
prevalence of between 2.4 and 25.9%.

Senol et al. 129
In a study conducted by Bilgic et al.31 with
266 children aged 4­18 years who were
diagnosed with ADHD, 36.1% of the chil-
dren had CD and 25.9% had ODD. A recent
study by Ercan et al.11,12 found an ODD
prevalence of 2.4%.
There are conflicting findings in the lit-
erature linking ADHD with socioeconomic
status. Consistent with some previous
works, adverse family factors were found
to be associated with detected DBD symp-
toms in our study.32,33 We found that
compared with their counterparts, ADHD
and other DBDs were more prevalent in
boys and children whose parents had lower
monthly incomes and whose mothers were
homemakers. In recent studies, ADHD
symptoms have been suggested to be 2­5
times more prevalent in boys than in girls34
and the predominantly inattentive subtype
of ADHD has been shown to be significantly
more common in girls than in boys.27,35­38
Likewise, our study found that some sub-
scale scores and overall mean scores were
significantly higher in boys, children whose
parents were illiterate, those whose mothers
were homemakers, children whose fathers
were manual labourers, and those whose
family had lower monthly incomes.
In our study, the sex ratio for ADHD and
other disorders (ODD and CD) ranged from
1.2:1 to 2.7:1. Whereas the reported sex ratio
is 9:1 in clinical sampling, it increases to
4:1 in population screenings. For the pre-
dominantly hyperactive/impulsive subtype,
the sex ratio is 4:1; however, in the pre-
dominantly inattentive subtype, this ratio
decreases to 2:1. In other words, girls are
more vulnerable to the predominantly
inattentive subtype of ADHD.39 In a study
by Toros and Tataroglu38 in Turkey, the
female/male ratio was 1:3.65 whereas in
another study among 219 primary school
children diagnosed with AD, this ratio was
reported to be 1:3.5.40 In a retrospective
study by Aktepe et al.8 of 763 children aged
7­12 years who were admitted to the
Psychiatry Clinic of Suleyman Demirel
University Faculty of Medicine, the most
frequently diagnosed disorder in boys was
ADHD (15.8%) whereas females were diag-
nosed with ADHD at a rate of 5.2%. In
contrast to previous works8,39,40, the differ-
ence between male and female ratios of
ADHD decreased significantly in our study.
Unlike those reports, in another study of 401
children diagnosed with ADHD, whereas
there was no significant difference by sex in
the combined type (coexisting AD and HAI),
the predominantly hyperactive subtype was
more prevalent among boys and the predom-
inantly inattentive subtype was more preva-
lent among girls.18
Consequently, it is clear that DBD symp-
toms are more prevalent in boys than in girls
when the symptom distributions and sub-
types are taken into consideration. However,
this prevalence rate must be further investi-
gated to prove it is in fact more dominant in
one sex. The tendency of these disorders to
manifest in the form of attention deficit and
cognitive difficulties in females owing to
biological characteristics may lead to DBDs
being less diagnosed in females. For instance,
simple signs like having less motivation or
spending less time studying may be con-
sidered the reason for poor academic per-
formance; thus, it may be possible to miss the
more serious underlying reasons behind such
changes; because the problem is attributed to
other causes, no treatment-seeking behaviour
takes place. Male children are reported to
have a greater tendency for extrinsic prob-
lems owing to their biological and genetic
characteristics. They are also shown greater
tolerance by those around them for these
problems, which in turn results in such
behavioural problems becoming more
permanent.41,42
The presence of AD and poor cognitive
abilities in boys owing to problems such as
CD, impulsivity, hyperactivity, and intra-
and extra-familial social problems related to
these (e.g., quarrels, arguments, and causing
130 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
accidents) means that boys get more atten-
tion and more effort is made to seek a
solution. This in turn decreases the likeli-
hood of overlooking the disorder in boys.
It is obvious that ADHD is more prevalent
in boys than in girls. Nevertheless, it should
be borne in mind that the sex ratio differ-
ence, as stated in our study and in other
studies, may be lower in reality. The fact
that many studies base their assessments on
diagnostic criteria decreases the significance
of these stated justifications; however, our
approach may still be significant. This is
owing to certain symptoms being given more
consideration than others because the
assessment of individuals is based on assess-
ment by their families.
In our study, the prevalence and severity
of HAI was found to be significantly higher
among boys, children aged 7­12 years, those
whose parents were illiterate, children whose
mothers were homemakers, and those from
low-income families, consistent with previ-
ous studies.3,4 As reported previously43,44,
the degree of communication between chil-
dren and mothers with higher education
levels is usually such that mothers can spot
any unfavourable changes in their children
earlier, and they will ask for professional help
when necessary. Because mothers with higher
education levels can more easily recognise
behavioural changes in their children and will
seek treatment at an early stage, and because
they are more deeply involved in their chil-
dren's education, they can more easily dis-
courage any unfavourable attitudes and
behaviours observed in their children.
Similarly, we found the prevalence and
severity of ODD to be significantly higher
in boys and in children whose mothers were
homemakers, from low-income families,
and whose fathers were illiterate. Because
homemakers have a more intense and pro-
longed relationship with their children than
mothers who work outside the home, there
may be more opportunities for mothers and
their children to disagree; thus, ODD may
be observed more intensely in children, as a
reaction to such conflict.
In our study, the prevalence and severity
of CD was found to be significantly higher in
boys, in children aged 13­15 years, and in
those whose mothers are homemakers and
from low-income families (p < 0.01). C
¸ ak
et al.45 stated in their study that there is a
relationship between being from a family
with high socioeconomic status and fewer
diagnoses of AD and HAI disorders. Based
on the traditional knowledge that unfavour-
able family and environmental factors have
a significant role in causing, triggering, and
the prognosis of mental problems, the prog-
nosis in children with ADHD is expected to
be adversely affected by conditions such as
severe marital problems, lower social class,
extended family structure, fathers with a
greater inclination toward criminality,
maternal history of a mental disorder, and
being in foster care, all of which are con-
sidered family and environmental factors.46
Despite some limitations in this research,
ours is one of the few studies evaluating
ADHD, ODD, and CD together in school-
age children. In addition, this population-
based study also examined the association
between sociodemographic factors and
DBD symptoms.
Conclusion
The prevalence of ADHD and other
DBD symptoms was 27.4% in our study.
The most prevalent disorder was CD.
The detected DBD symptoms were closely
associated with children's age and sex, as
well as parental education level, occupation,
monthly income, and family structure.
ADHD and other DBDs were more preva-
lent among boys and children from less
educated, low-income families compared
with their peers. In terms of exposure, boys
were found to be more vulnerable to DBDs.
The awareness of parents and treatment-
seeking behaviour are highly valuable for
Senol et al. 131
early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of
these disorders.
Limitations of the study
The main limitation of our study is that the
children were not actually examined diag-
nosed with ADHD by a physician.
Therefore, because the research data were
based on reports of family members and
sociocultural differences exist between
families, the collected data are likely to be
subjective, even if only to a small degree. In
other words, there may be differences
between educated and illiterate parents in
perceiving and interpreting the same symp-
toms. In this context, not having matched
parents is a subjectivity factor.
Another limitation was that because of our
data were obtained based only on parental
reporting, the prevalence of ADHD and other
DBDs may have been over- or underreported,
compared with information gathered from
combined sources such as parents plus tea-
chers or clinicians plus parents.
Informed Consent
An invitation letter explaining the purpose of the
study and a voluntary consent form were sent,
along with data collection tools, in a sealed
envelope to parents of the selected students.
Written informed consent was obtained from the
