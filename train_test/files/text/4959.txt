Abstract
Objective: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the leading causes of nosocomial infection. The
present study tested the in vitro efficacy of ceftazidime or imipenem combined with amikacin,
levofloxacin and colistin in P.aeruginosa isolates.
Methods: P.aeruginosa strains, isolated from clinical samples, were assessed for antibiotic
susceptibility using the disc diffusion method. Antibiotic combination tests were performed using
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test strips and the sum of the Fractional Inhibitory
Concentration (ÆFIC) index was used to assess synergy.
Results: Out of 60 isolated P.aeruginosa strains, 100% were susceptible to colistin and 26.7% (16
strains) were multidrug resistant. MIC50 and MIC90 values were 2 and 32 mg/ml for imipenem; 1.5
and 24 mg/ml for ceftazidime; 3 and 8 mg/ml for amikacin; 0.38 and 32 mg/ml for levofloxacin; 1 and
1.5 mg/ml for colistin, respectively. Antagonism was not found in any of the antibiotic combinations
tested. The amikacin­ceftazidime combination was found to have a synergistic effect in 15% of the
strains, but no synergistic effect was detected for other combinations.
Conclusions: In Pseudomonas infection, alternative treatment options using different antibiotic
combinations should be tested in vitro and findings should be confirmed by clinical studies.

multiple virulence factors (with various
enzymes and toxins).1 P. aeruginosa may
readily colonize the hospital setting and is
one of the most prevalent pathogens respon-
sible for nosocomial infections.2 The various
resistance mechanisms of P. aeruginosa
include enzymatic hydrolysis (b-lactamases,
particularly metallo-b-lactamase), efflux
pump and low intrinsic outer membrane
permeability.3 As a result, infection with
multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas causes ser-
ious problems in the treatment of nosoco-
mial infection, and resistant P. aeruginosa
infections increase mortality, morbidity and
treatment costs.4 Alternative drugs for the
treatment of those Pseudomonas infections
that are resistant to multiple antibiotics
(resistant to more than three groups) have
yet to be investigated.3
Concomitant use of antibiotics (combin-
ation therapy) is recommended for severe
infections when P. aeruginosa is the sus-
pected pathogen, in order to prevent the
development of resistance during treatment
and to achieve a wide spectrum of activity.
In addition to preventing the development
of resistance, combined use of antibiotics
(such as b-lactams, quinolones and amino-
glycosides) may have synergistic effects and
may reduce the occurrence of side-effects,
since each drug is used at a lower dose than
would be used for monotherapy.5
Susceptibility tests to investigate the syn-
ergistic antibacterial effectiveness of two
different drugs for the same pathogen can
be difficult to perform in vitro, and drugs are
usually chosen according to the relevant
guidelines. It is therefore important to
ensure guidelines are constantly updated
with information on the changing resistance
rates.
In the present study, various antibiotic
combinations were tested in vitro for their
effectiveness against P. aeruginosa, with the
aim of updating information on resistance
rates for several widely used antibiotic com-
binations, and to provide data on the
effectiveness of new combinations.
Guideline-recommended combinations,6 in
addition to novel combinations including
colistin (a recently introduced drug that is
underutilized in combination tests), were
used in the present study.
Materials and methods
Identification of bacteria
This study included P. aeruginosa strains
isolated from hospitalized patients treated at
The Faculty of Medicine, Gaziantep
University, Sahinbey Research and
Training Hospital, Gaziantep, Turkey,
between December 2012 and June 2013.
No investigation was undertaken regarding
the origins of each pathogen and whether or
not the infections were nosocomial. This
study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Faculty of Medicine,
Gaziantep University, Turkey (No.
04.12.2012/448).
Clinical isolates were characterized using
conventional methods and identified using a
BD PhoenixTM Automated Microbiology
System (BD, San Jose, CA, USA). Isolates
were stored at ­80C and subcultured in
brain­heart infusion agar (Oxoid,
Basingstoke, UK) prior to testing.
Antibiotic susceptibility testing
Antibiotic susceptibility tests were per-
formed using the disc diffusion method
according to Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.7
Imipenem, meropenem, aztreonam, ceftazi-
dime, cefepime, gentamicin, amikacin,
tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin,
piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sul-
bactam, and ticarcillin/clavulonic acid anti-
biotic discs (Oxoid) were used for testing.
Susceptibility to colistin was determined
by LiofilchemÕ minimum inhibitory concen-
tration (MIC) test strips (Liofilchem,
Abruzzo, TE, Italy), since colistin is not
218 Journal of International Medical Research 43(2)
commercially available in disc form.
P. aeruginosa ATCCÕ27853TM (ATCC,
Manassas, VA, USA) was used as a suscep-
tible control strain.
Antibiotic combination testing (synergy
test)
Antibiotic combinations were tested using
the LiofilchemÕ MIC test strips, to determine
the combined antimicrobial effects on the
isolated P. aeruginosa strains.8 LiofilchemÕ
MIC test strips had the following standard
antibiotic concentrations (mg/ml): colistin,
0.016­256; amikacin, 0.016­256; ceftazi-
dime, 0.016­256; imipenem, 0.002­32; and
levofloxacin, 0.002­32.
The following antibiotic combinations
were tested: amikacin þ ceftazidime; amika-
cin þ imipenem; levofloxacin þ ceftazidime;
levofloxacin þ imipenem; colistin þ ceftazi-
dime; colistin þ imipenem. MIC required
to inhibit 50% and 90% of the strains
(MIC50 and MIC90, respectively) were
calculated using MicrosoftÕ ExcelÕ 2007
software (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA,
USA).
Bacterial suspensions homogenized in
sterile saline were prepared from overnight
fresh cultures to a McFarland standard of
0.5 and inoculated into 150 mm Mueller-
Hinton agar plates (four plates per bac-
terial isolate). The agar plates were
allowed to stand for 15­20 min at room
temperature to allow any excess surface
moisture to be absorbed before placement
of MIC test strips according to the fol-
lowing protocol: For each bacterial iso-
late, three amikacin strips were placed
onto the first plate; three levofloxacin
strips were placed onto the second plate;
three colistin strips were placed onto the
third plate; and one strip each of imi-
penem and ceftazidime was placed onto
the fourth plate (to determine MIC for
imipenem and ceftazidime). Strips were
placed at 30-mm intervals.
Plate numbers 1, 2 and 3 were used for
combination testing. For each plate, the first
two strips were replaced with the second
antibiotic strip according to the combin-
ation to be tested. The third strip was left in
place to determine the MIC value of the
initial antibiotic alone.
The start- and endpoints of strips to be
replaced were marked on the back of each
plate. Following incubation for 1 h at room
temperature, amikacin, levofloxacin and
colistin MIC test strips were removed and
replaced with imipenem and ceftazidime
strips, ensuring that the concentration lines
overlapped. The plates were then incubated
at 37C for 18­20 h, after which the anti-
microbial concentration at the point where
the diameter of the inhibition zone inter-
sected with the edge of the MIC test strip
was recorded as the MIC value. MIC values
were interpreted as recommended by CLSI
guidelines.7
Estimation of FIC index
The sum of the fractional inhibitory con-
centration index (ÆFIC) was calculated to
determine the effect of antibiotic combin-
ations. For antibiotics used in combination,
the first antibiotic was designated `A' and
the second `B'. The ÆFIC value was calcu-
lated using the following formula:
ÆFICindex ¼ FICA þ FICB
FICA ¼ combined MICðAþBÞ
=MICA
FICB ¼ combined MICðAþBÞ
=MICB
Results of calculations were interpreted
as previously described.9 A calculated ÆFIC
value of 0.5 represented a synergistic effect
(i.e. total effect greater than the sum of the
individual antibiotic effects), a value
between >0.5 and <2 represented an indif-
ferent (additive) effect (i.e. no additional
contribution from including the second anti-
biotic, compared with use of the first
Nazli et al. 219
antibiotic alone), and a value of 2 repre-
sented an antagonistic effect (i.e. total effect
less than the sum of the individual effects).
Results
Sixty P. aeruginosa strains isolated from
various clinical samples were included in
the present study (Table 1) and all (100%)
were found to be susceptible to colistin
(Table 2). The second most effective anti-
biotic was amikacin, to which 56 isolates
(93.3%) were susceptible. The least effect-
ive antibiotic was aztreonam (26 suscep-
tible isolates [43.3%]).
A total of 16 P. aeruginosa isolates
(26.7%) were susceptible to all of the anti-
biotics tested. Another 16 (26.7%) strains
were found to be resistant (multidrug resist-
ant) to at least three classes of antibiotics
including cephalosporins (only ceftazidime
or cefepime), aminoglycosides, fluoroquino-
lones, carbapenems and piperacillin.
Synergy tests
The MIC ranges for imipenem, ceftazidime,
amikacin, levofloxacin and colistin tested
against 60 isolated P. aeruginosa strains, and
the MIC50 and MIC90 values, are shown
(Table 3).
The effects of antibiotic combinations
tested against the 60 clinically isolated
P. aeruginosa strains were assessed using
the ÆFIC index criteria (Table 4). Three
hundred and sixty FIC values were obtained
for six antibiotic combinations tested on
60 P. aeruginosa isolates; of these, 351
(97.5%) were indifferent and nine (2.5%)
exhibited synergistic effects. Antagonism
was not found between any of the antibiotic
combinations tested. Amikacin­ceftazidime
was the only combination to show synergis-
tic effects (seen in nine isolates, 15%).
Among the 16 (26.7%) multidrug-resistant
isolates, the amikacin­ceftazidime combin-
ation showed a synergistic effect in one
isolate (6.3%; data not shown).

Discussion
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most
prevalent pathogens found in the hospital
environment.10 P. aeruginosa is an oppor-
tunistic pathogen which has the ability to
survive in harsh conditions; its presence may
lead to severe, difficult-to-treat infections in
immunocompromised patient populations
including patients with cystic fibrosis,
burn-related infections or HIV-positivity.11
The increased observance of multidrug
resistance (mainly to b-lactam antibiotics) in
Pseudomonas strains isolated from nosoco-
mial infections is making it increasingly
difficult to treat infections caused by this
pathogen.2 Resistance to antimicrobials in
Pseudomonas strains develops via a number
of mechanisms, including the production of
specific enzymes (b-lactamases, enzymes
that modify aminoglycosides, for example),
changes in cell-membrane permeability and
active efflux systems.12
The rate of antibiotic resistance in the
hospital setting depends mainly on the anti-
biotic policy, but also on the physical struc-
ture of that hospital, patient characteristics,
and frequency of invasive procedures per-
formed.13 Knowledge of the resistance
phenotype and local resistance surveillance
is important for empirical treatment.6
Numerous studies relating to the anti-
biotic susceptibility of P. aeruginosa have
been published.14­18 In the present study,
none of the tested isolates were resistant to
colistin, which was found to be the most
effective antibiotic. Amikacin was found to
be the second most-effective antibiotic, and
of the 60 isolates tested, 16 (26.7%) were
multidrug resistant.
Resistance to an antibiotic used for treat-
ment more commonly develops in P. aeru-
ginosa infections compared with other
bacteria, and antibiotic monotherapy is fre-
quently associated with treatment difficulties
compared with combination regimens.2
Thus, combined antibiotic therapy is usually
administered for treating P. aeruginosa

antibacterial efficacy, to slow development
of resistance and to reduce the possibility of
side-effects by giving lower doses of individ-
ual drugs.5,19
The most commonly used antibiotic com-
bination in P. aeruginosa infections is the b-
lactam/aminoglycoside combination, which
usually shows a synergistic effect.20,21
Several different drug combinations have
been previously tested using various investi-
gation techniques,19,21­23 each with their
own advantages and disadvantages. In the
present study, the MIC test strip method
was chosen for ease of performance and
evaluation, and because of ready access to
the test strips relating to the antibiotics
undergoing investigation.
In the present study, amikacin­ceftazi-
dime and amikacin­imipenem combinations
were tested to explore the synergistic effects
of an aminoglycoside/b-lactam combin-
ation, but such an effect was only observed
for amikacin­ceftazidime (in 15% of iso-
lates). Synergistic interactions involving
these combinations have been reported in
many studies.22,24,25
Use of b-lactam and fluoroquinolone in
combination (ciprofloxacin/levofloxacin)
has increased considerably, and synergistic
effects have been reported.20 A study of
P. aeruginosa found a synergistic effect for
imipenem­ciprofloxacin in 3.1% of strains,
no synergistic effect for imipenem­levo-
floxacin, a synergistic effect for merope-
nem­ciprofloxacin in 6.2% of strains, and
no synergistic effect for meropenem­levo-
floxacin.26 In the present study, levofloxacin
was chosen to represent quinolones and the
efficacies of levofloxacin­ceftazidime and
levofloxacin­imipenem combinations were
investigated. No synergistic effect was found
for levofloxacin­ceftazidime in any of the
strains tested. Similarly, there was no syn-
ergistic effect for the levofloxacin­imipenem
combination. These results suggest that an
antibiotic combination involving levofloxa-
cin may not be the most suitable first-line
treatment option in the hospital setting as
used in the present study.
Colistin is regaining popularity as a
treatment option for multidrug-resistant
infections; in vitro and limited clinical stu-
dies, as well as its use as monotherapy,
suggest that colistin may also be used in
combination with other drugs (carbape-
nems, other b-lactams, aminoglycosides
and quinolones).27 Several studies have
tested colistin in combination with imi-
penem, meropenem, ceftazidime and rifam-
picin and reported either synergistic effects
or ineffectiveness.28,29
In the present study, the colistin­
imipenem and colistin­ceftazidime combin-
ations both showed indifferent effects in
100% of strains tested, however no

antagonistic effect was observed. This might
have resulted from the fact that all of the
studied isolates were already susceptible to
colistin, which suggests that this antibiotic
should not be the first choice for
monotherapy.
Out of 16 multidrug-resistant isolates
tested in the present study, the amikacin­
ceftazidime combination showed a synergis-
tic effect in one isolate (6.3%). Thus,
aminoglycoside/cephalosporin antibiotic
combinations may represent potential first-
line options for treating multidrug resistant
isolates, when limited by treatment options.
Susceptibility testing should be properly
analysed during antibiotic selection and
individual hospitals should select the anti-
biotic regimen that is most suitable for the
established resistance profile within the
hospital.
The present study was limited by budget
restrictions. Disc-diffusion and MIC-strip
testing is costly to undertake; consequently
only 60 consecutive clinically isolated
Pseudomonas strains were included, and
combinations of colistin, amikacin and levo-
floxacin with ceftazidime and imipenem
were investigated, governed by the number
of MIC test strips available. Ideally, the
present in vitro results should also be sup-
ported by in vivo studies.
In conclusion, we suggest that use of an
appropriate antibiotic for treatment of
P. aeruginosa infection is more important
than the discovery of a novel antibiotic, in
relation to managing bacterial resistance
mechanisms. Susceptibility testing should
be properly analysed during antibiotic selec-
tion and individual hospitals should select
the antibiotic regimen that is most suitable
for the established resistance profile within
the hospital.
