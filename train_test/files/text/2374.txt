Hookah Use Among US High School Seniors
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Hookah use is increasing
dramatically among US adolescents. Many consider it a safer
alternative to cigarettes. Existing studies often use
nonrepresentative local populations to assess prevalence and
correlates of hookah use.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study used a nationally
representative sample of US high school seniors. It confirmed
some previously found correlates and determined that
adolescents of higher socioeconomic status were at high risk for
hookah use.
abstract
OBJECTIVES: Prevalence of hookah use is increasing significantly among
adolescents. This study aimed to delineate demographic and socioeco-
nomic correlates of hookah use among high school seniors in the
United States. We hypothesized that more impoverished adolescents
and those who smoked cigarettes would be more likely to use hookahs.
METHODS: Data were examined for 5540 high school seniors in Mon-
itoring the Future (years 2010­2012), an annual nationally represen-
tative survey of high school students in the United States. Using data
weights provided by Monitoring the Future, we used multivariable
binary logistic regression to delineate correlates of hookah use in
the last 12 months.
RESULTS: Eighteen percent of students reported hookah use in the past
year. Compared with white students, black students were at lower odds
for use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.27, P , .0001). High parent
education increased the odds for use (AOR = 1.58, P , .001), and
student weekly income from a job of .$50/week (AOR = 1.26, P , .05)
or $11 to $50 per week from other sources (AOR = 1.35, P , .01) also
increased odds for use. Males and urban students were also at
higher odds for use, as were users of alcohol, marijuana, and
other illicit substances. Former cigarette smokers were at higher
risk, and current smokers were at highest risk for use.
CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents of higher socioeconomic status appear to
be at particularly high risk for hookah use in the United States. Pre-
vention efforts must target this group as prevalence continues to in-
crease. Pediatrics 2014;134:227­234

ARTICLE
Although cigarette use is declining
precipitously among youth,1­4 evidence
indicates that American adolescents
are turning to ethnically linked alter-
nativetobaccoproducts,suchashookahs,
cigars, and various smokeless tobacco
products.5,6 A recent report from the
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention warns that the drop in ciga-
rette consumption is being "offset by
increases in other forms of tobacco."7
Although alternative tobacco use may
have originated among immigrants
from South Asia and the Middle East,
use of hookah has clearly moved into
the mainstream US population.8
Hookah, an ancient form of smoking in
which shisha (an herbal material that
canbetobacco-ornon­tobacco-based)
smoke is passed through water before
inhalation, is 1 such alternative to-
bacco product. Hookah smoking is
rapidly gaining popularity among ado-
lescents in the United States and
worldwide. Existing data based on the
2011 US National Youth Tobacco Survey
indicated that 8% of adolescents
reported ever trying hookah, and 3%
reported using hookah within the past
month.9 The most recent data pub-
lished in the Morbidity and Mortality
Weekly Review showed an increase of
hookah use from from 4.1% in 2011 to
5.4% in 2012 among high school stu-
dents,1 and recent work by our group
found that nearly 1 in 5 adolescents in
the United States reported having tried
hookah before high school gradua-
tion.9 The most alarming statistic was
recently reported from the Monitoring
the Future (MTF) study, which found
that 12-month hookah use significantly
increased among US high school
seniors from 18.3% in 2012 to 21.4% in
2013.3
Althoughtheliteratureonhealtheffects
of hookah smoking and exposure to
secondhand smoke from hookahs is
limited,existingdataareconsistentand
suggest significant adverse health
outcomes. Research has shown that
hookahsdeliver tar,nicotine,andcarbon
monoxide in even higher doses than
cigarettes.10­12 Moreover, recent meta-
analyses have linked hookah use to
lung cancer, respiratory illness, peri-
odontal diseases, and low birth weights.13
Individual studies have linked use to
esophageal cancer,14,15 chromosomal
aberrations,16 decreased pulmonary
and cardiovascular functions,17,18
infertility,19 dental problems,20 and
infectious diseases.21 Surveys of univer-
sity students in multiple countries, in-
cluding the United States, suggest that
people are unaware of these dangers22­35
and believe that hookah is less harmful
andless addictive than cigarettes.22,23,25­35
A number of studies have examined the
prevalence and correlates of hookah
use among local and national pop-
ulations,9,36 including US adolescents.
The current study complements and
expands on previous findings by in-
vestigating a number of previously
unexplored but potentially important
predictors of adolescent hookah use in
a nationally representative sample of
high school students in the United
States. This study delineates specific
demographic, socioeconomic, and sub-
stance use factors related to hookah use
among US high school seniors. It was
hypothesized that more impoverished
adolescents with more poorly educated
parents would be more likely to use
hookahs, as is true of adolescent ciga-
rette use. Similarly, it was hypothesized
that hookah use would be independently
associated with use of cigarettes, alco-
hol, and illicit drugs.
METHODS
Procedure
MTFisanannualcross-sectionalsurvey
of high school seniors in 130 public
and private schools throughout 48
states in the United States. Schools are
selected through a multistage random
sampling procedure: geographic areas
are selected, then schools within areas
are selected, and then students within
schools are selected.37,38 Approximately
15 000 seniors are assessed every year.
MTF assesses content through 6 dif-
ferent survey forms, which are dis-
tributed randomly. All forms assess
demographics, socioeconomic variables,
and use of various licit and illicit sub-
stances; however, only survey Form 3
assesses (last 12-month) hookah use.
Therefore, hookah use was assessed in
only about one-sixth of the sample. MTF
began assessing hookah use in 2010, so
this analysis focuses on aggregated (and
weighted)Form3datacollectedfromthe
3 most recent cohorts with available
data (2010­2012). MTF protocols were
reviewed and approved by the University
of Michigan Institutional Review Board.
Measures
Students were asked to indicate their
gender, age (,18, $18 years), and
race or ethnicity (ie, black, white, His-
panic). MTF classified population
density of students' residences as in
terms of metropolitan statistical areas
(MSAs). Small MSAs are defined as
counties or groups of counties with $1
city of $50 000 inhabitants, and the 24
largest MSAs are defined as large
MSAs.37 Non-MSAs are the remaining
areas. To assess family composition,
students were asked which parents
they lived with. Answers were coded as
0 parents, 1 parent, or 2 parents. Level
of religiosity was determined by 2 or-
dinal items that asked about level of
religious attendance and importance.
These items were computed into a
composite (range 1­4) and divided into
tertiles indicating low (1.0­2.0), mod-
erate (2.5­3.0), and high (3.5­4.0) re-
ligiosity. Parent level of educational
attainment (ie, grade school, some
high school, high school graduate,
some college, college graduate, or
graduate school) was assessed for
each parent, and a mean score for both
parents (or raw score if only 1 parent)
228 PALAMAR et al
was coded into 3 groups: low (1.0­3.0),
medium (3.5­4.0), and high (4.5­6.0)
education. Students were also asked
how much they earn during the aver-
age week from a job or other work and
how much money they earned from
other sources. Responses for each of
these 2 income items were coded into
#$10 or less, $11­50, or $$51. Coding
of sociodemographic variables was
based on previous MTF analyses.39,40
MTF assessed annual hookah use
through the following item: "During the
last 12 months, on how many occasions
(if any) have you smoked tobacco using
a hookah (water pipe)?" Answer options
were 0 occasions, 1 or 2 occasions, 3 to 5
occasions, 6 to 9 occasions, 10 to 19
occasions, 20 to 39 occasions, and $40.
Using the same answeroptions, MTFalso
assessed lifetime use of alcohol, mari-
juana (pot, weed, hashish), and other il-
licit substances including cocaine, crack,
LSD, hallucinogens other than LSD, her-
oin, and nonmedical use of narcotics
(other than heroin), tranquilizers (eg,
benzodiazepines), sedatives (eg, barbi-
turates), and amphetamine. We di-
chotomized hookah use into ever
used versus never used, and use of
all other illicit substances afore-
mentioned was also dichotomized
into lifetime use (yes versus no) for
each. A new indicator was created
for any illicit substance use other
than marijuana; specifically, stu-
dents were coded as whether they
indicated use of any of these sub-
stances. This variable was computed if
the student provided data for $4 of
these substances (other than mari-
juana). Therefore, students who did not
provide (yes/no) responses for $4
substances were removed from the
analytic sample. Finally, lifetime ciga-
rette use was assessed, and answer
options were never, once or twice, oc-
casionally but not regularly, regularly
in the past, and regularly now.
Statistical Analyses
Analyses focused on students with com-
plete substance use and sociodemo-
graphic data (N = 5540), although we
allowed race or ethnicity and religiosity
to be missing. All analyses used the
survey sample weights provided by MTF.
This was done to adjust for differential
probability of selection of schools and
students. All percentages reported are
also weighted. Hookah use in the analytic
sample did not significantly differ across
cohorts (2010, 17.4%; 2011, 18.4%; 2012,
18.2%; P = .76), giving us confidence in
combining datasets into a single cross-
section for analysis. We examined de-
scriptive statistics for each covariate
and compared sample characteristics
according to hookah use (ie, no use
versus use). This was done using Rao­
Scott x2 tests for homogeneity, which
correct for the complex study design.41
All variables were then fit into a multi-
variable binary logistic regression model
with hookah use (yes or no) as the out-
come to determine conditional associa-
tions (controlling forall other covariates).
Specifically, covariates were modeled to
explain hookah use compared with no
use. This model produces an adjusted
odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence in-
terval (CI) for each covariate. Indicators
for cohort (with 2010 as the comparison)
were included in the model to adjust for
potential cohort effects or secular trends,
and because large percentages of stu-
dents were missing race (14.8%) or re-
ligiosity (25.0%) data, we entered missing
data indicators into the model for these
2 variables instead of deleting these
cases.39,42 All analyses were design-based
for survey data (PROC SURVEYFREQ and
PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC),43 conducted using
SAS 9.3 software (SAS Institute, Inc,
Cary, NC).
RESULTS
The annual prevalence of hookah use
was 18.0% (the mean prevalence of
2010­2012 data). Table 1 presents the
descriptive statistics of the sample and
the comparisons of demographic, so-
cioeconomic, and substance use vari-
ables by hookah use. Bivariable (x2
test) results suggest that identifying as
male, nonblack, or nonreligious was
associated with use. Likewise, students
residing in small or large MSAs and
students reporting higher (eg, $$50)
weekly income or income from "other
sources" were more likely to report
use. In addition, students who smoked
cigarettes (at any level other than
never) or reported lifetime use of al-
cohol, marijuana, or other illicit sub-
stances were all more likely to report
hookah use. Hookah use did not sig-
nificantly differ by age, family struc-
ture, or level of parental education.
After examining bivariable associa-
tions, we then fit all covariates simul-
taneously into a binary logistic
regression model (Table 2). The model
had good fit (Nagelkerke R2 = 40%,
Correct Classification Rate = 85%).
Compared with males, females were at
lower odds for using hookah (AOR
= 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67­0.98), and students
identifying as black (compared with
white) had lower odds of use (AOR
= 0.27; 95% CI, 0.17­0.41). Compared
with residing in a non-metropolitan
statistical area, students in both
small (AOR = 2.67; 95% CI, 2.04­3.49)
and large MSAs (AOR = 2.64; 95% CI,
1.95­3.56) were at higher odds of use.
Although religiosity was a protective
factor in the bivariable model, re-
ligiosity was not significant in explain-
ing hookah use in the multivariable
model. In contrast, although parent edu-
cational attainment was not significant in
the bivariable model, moderate (AOR =
1.33; 95% CI, 1.03­1.73) and high parent
education (AOR = 1.58; 95% CI, 1.24­2.02)
were risk factors for use in the multivar-
iable model. With regard to student in-
come, earning $$50 per week from a job
was a risk factor for use (AOR = 1.26; 95%
CI, 1.02­1.56), and earning $11 to $50 per

weekfrom"othersources"wasalsoarisk
factor for use (AOR = 1.35; 95% CI, 1.10­
1.67).
Withrespecttosubstanceuse,cigarette
smoking was 1 of the most robust and
consistent risk factors for hookah use.
Current smokers (those who smoke
occasionally or regularly) were at
higher odds for hookah use than past
smokers (those who reported smoking
once or twice, or regularly in the past).
Regular smokers in particular were at
highestoddsforuse(AOR=5.12;95%CI,
3.61­7.26). With regard to other life-
time substance use, alcohol and mari-
juana use both increased the odds for
hookah use. Use of other illicit sub-
stances was also significantly associ-
ated with hookah use but to a weaker
degree than cigarette smoking, alcohol
use, and marijuana use.
DISCUSSION
The emergence of widespread hookah
useamongUSadolescentshasresulted
in a growing body of epidemiologic
studies on its use. However, most
studies have relied on small, non-
representativesamples.Incontrast,the
current study uses data from a large,
nationally representative sample of
5540 US high school seniors. While
confirming previously identified risk
factors, this study also uncovered
a number of formerly unrecognized
correlates of use by adolescents, such
as urban residence and high parental
education. Moreover, higher weekly
income, cigarette smoking, and use of
alcohol, marijuana, or other illicit
substances were also found to be as-
sociated with more frequent hookah
use.
Many demographic predictors of hoo-
kahuseuncoveredinthisstudy,suchas
male gender and nonblack race, were
consistent with findings of previous
studies.22,25,28,35,44­48 However, although
another study49 found religiosity to be
a protective factor against use, in this
study this association lost significance
after we controlled for other de-
mographic, socioeconomic, and sub-
stance use variables. Although still
rudimentary, the socioeconomic dy-
namics of hookah use are gradually

being elucidated. Given the cost of fre-
quenting hookah bars, it is not sur-
prising that wealthier students, as
indicated by higher weekly income,
are more regular visitors, although it
remains unknown what proportion of
hookah use occurs in hookah bars
versus in homes or other non-
commercial settings.46,50 Our finding
that students with higher parental ed-
ucation are more likely to be hookah
users also supports the hypothesis
that hookah smoking, unlike cigarette
smoking, is a social activity often oc-
curring among those of higher socio-
economic status. In fact, hookahs and
cigarettes, though both tobacco prod-
ucts, have several differences in terms
of their predictors and distribution of
use among US adolescents. Well-known
risk factors for cigarette use among
adolescents, such as lower socioeco-
nomic status and lower parental edu-
cation, unexpectedly were associated
with lower rates of hookah use.51,52
Similar to the findings of this study,
Sutfin et al35 reported concurrent use of
hookah with alcohol, marijuana, and
other illicit substances. Among current
hookah users in the Sutfin study, 22%
reported never trying a cigarette, sug-
gesting that hookah use may be their
first encounter with tobacco products.
In this study, only 6.3% reported never
smoking a cigarette. Given the addictive
nature of the nicotine in tobacco, these
data raise concern that hookah use may
serve as a gateway to cigarette smok-
ing. However, it may be more likely that
cigarette use occurs before hookah use.
To better understand the temporal se-
quence of hookah use relative to that of
cigarette and marijuana use, Fielder
et al53 followed 424 first-year college
women until graduation and found that
precollege hookah use predicted ciga-
rette initiation or relapse, thereby sup-
porting the aforementioned gateway
theory. Interestingly, although pre-
college marijuana use predicted hoo-
kah initiation, precollege cigarette use
predicted neither hookah nor mari-
juana initiation, suggesting a complex
interplay between these potentially ad-
dictive substances. Clearly, more longi-
tudinalstudiesusingmorerepresentative
samples are needed to investigate tem-
poral associations.
A common belief among adolescents
and young adults is that hookah use is

less harmful and addictive than ciga-
rettes.22,23,25­35 This misconception
probably leads to the social normali-
zation of hookah use as a trendy and
acceptable way to have fun with
friends.24,27,31,33,34,48,54­56 Several stud-
ies have demonstrated that more ac-
curate knowledge about hookahs is
directly related to less frequent hookah
use. In fact, those with more accurate
information about the health effects of
hookah use were more likely both to
report greater perceived risk and to
voice an intention to quit.57,58 Un-
fortunately, the data available from
MTF did not enable us to investigate
this critical issue, but clearer un-
derstanding of the association between
accurate knowledge and hookah-related
attitudes and behaviors might have
clinical and public health policy implica-
tions.
Despite the important findings in this
study, a number of limitations exist.
Hookah use was assessed only in high
school seniors; use was not assessed
among younger adolescents (eg, in the
8th- or 10th-grade MTF samples) or
young adults, and these data do not
provide information on the many ado-
lescents who drop out of school before
their senior year of high school. In ad-
dition,MTFbeganassessinghookahuse
only in 2010 and assessed use through
only 1 of 6 survey forms, so the amount
of data available was limited. We com-
bined the 3 cohorts of available data,
and annual prevalence did not differ
significantly across cohorts, so we did
not examine trends over time. Although
there were no statistical differences in
prevalence by cohort, we still included
cohort indicators in analyses. Missing
data, particularly the 14.8% missing
race or ethnicity and the 25.0% missing
religiosity, were problematic; however,
to maintain power we included missing
data indicators for these 2 variables in
multivariableanalyses.Lastly,asistrue
of much of the literature on adolescent
useofalternativetobaccoproducts, the
racial and ethnic information is quite
sparse given the increasing diversity of
the US population.
This is one of the few studies in the
research literature to use a large, na-
tionally representative sample of high
school senior students in the United
States to assess the prevalence and
predictors of hookah use. As an in-
creasingly popular social activity
among adolescents, hookah smoking
seems to appeal to those of higher
socioeconomic status and interplays
with cigarette smoking, alcohol, and
illicit substance use on many complex
levels. Given the rudimentary un-
derstanding of hookah use, it is crucial
for educators, health professionals,
researchers, and policy makers to
collaborate to fill in gaps in public un-
derstanding of its harm and guide
public interventions to diminish prob-
lematic hookah smoking.

SCENT OF A FUNGUS: Last week I was having dinner with friends at a lovely
restaurant. While I do not usually order risotto at restaurants, as I can make
many very good versions myself at home, this particular dish caught my eye
because it was made with truffles and garlic. I rarely cook with truffles as they
are expensive and hard to find in the Burlington area. I opted to order the risotto
dish and was rewarded with a spectacular dinner bursting with flavor.
As reported in The Wall Street Journal (Food: April 3, 2014), truffles are the small
knobby fruit of an underground fungus. In contrast to other mushrooms, this
particular fungus matures entirely underground. Initially, they are scentless but
as they mature they acquire a distinctive odor easily detected by animals such as
pigs or dogs. Truffles are highly prized in a variety of cuisines. The most famous
truffle is the French black Périgord truffle which may cost $2,000 a pound. Other
well-known (and very expensive) varieties include the Italian Alba white truffle
which has a scent reminiscent of garlic.
Untilrecently,fewtruffleswereproducedorharvestedintheUS.However,culinary
enthusiasts hope to change that. Truffles are now cultivated in Tennessee and
throughout Oregon. Oregon, in particular, has become the home of the American
truffle industry, and Périgord and white truffles have been cultivated there quite
successfully. While the flavors are not identical to their European brethren, they
perform well in blind tasting competitions and are much, much less expensive.
Unfortunately, they are hard to find outside Oregon. I have no idea which truffle
was used in my risotto dish or even the country of origin, but it was delicious and
made me want to have more.
