The Cost Of Providing Health Care Benefits To Early Retirees
by Paul Fronstin, Sara C. Snider, William S. Custer, and
Dallas L. Salisbury
Abstract: Subsidized health care benefits would be guaranteed for early retirees ages fifty-five to
sixty-four under President Bill Clinton's health care reform proposal. This is an important policy issue
because persons in this age group are the least likely age cohort of the nonelderly population to be
working. They are also the most likely to face high and uncertain health care costs. Previous research
has shown that access to continuation of health insurance coverage encourages retirement before age
sixty-five. These retirement effects can add substantially to the federal government's cost of providing
health care benefits to early retirees. Based upon various assumptions for premium levels, the induced
retirement effects of current workers, and the number of nonworkers qualifying for subsidized benefits,
we present total annual cost estimates to the federal government, based on 1994 figures, ranging from
$9.1 billion to $19.6 billion, to provide subsidized benefits to the nonworking population between
the ages of fifty-five and sixty-four.
Under President Bill Clinton's health reform proposal, early retirees
between the ages of fifty-five and sixty-four would be eligible for
government-subsidized postretirement health benefits beginning in
1998. The plan would guarantee the basic benefit package for all nonwork-
ers ages fifty-five through sixty-four, provided they have met all of the
requirements for Social Security benefits except for age.2 The federal gov-
ernment would pay 80 percent of the average weighted premium, freeing
firms and individuals from paying a major portion ofthe costs.3 This premium
would be community rated and would not vary by age. For retirees with
guaranteed benefits from their employer, the employer would cover the
retiree's share of the premium.4
Health insurance costs are potentially a large percentage of retirees'
expenditures. This plan would encourage early retirement among workers
by reducing their health insurance costs significantly. Large savings would
also accrue to firms that now provide early retiree health benefits, resulting
in incentives for employers to encourage early retirement, especially in
firms with an older work force.5

DATAWATCH 247
Providing health care benefits for early retirees is an important policy
issue because persons within this age group are already the least likely to be
working and the most likely to face uncertain health care expenditures
when compared with other nonelderly age groups.6 The near-elderly popu-
lation is a relatively high-risk population that does not qualify for Medicare
benefits; therefore, privately purchased health insurance can be a costly
commodity. The availability of low-cost retiree health insurance is an
incentive for the near-elderly to retire early.
It is almost certain that the provision of health care benefits to early
retirees would reduce the labor-force participation of this group and drive
up the federal government's costs of providing health care benefits. These
costs must be considered in the context of the current retired population
that would qualify for benefits as well as the working population that may
be induced to leave the labor force. Rising total costs of providing health
benefits to early retirees will become even more significant as the popula-
tion ages. This DataWatch reports estimates of the costs to the federal
government of providing subsidized health care benefits to nonworking
persons ages fifty-five to sixty-four, based on 1992 population estimates. A
range of estimates is presented based on assumptions about the premium
cost and the number of persons who could be affected by this proposal.
Characteristics Of The Near-Elderly Population
In 1992 the near-elderly comprised 8 percent (21.2 million) of the total
U.S. population.7 Exhibit 1 contains data on the major activity of the
near-elderly in 1992. According to the data, 62.2 percent were working,
and 1.5 percent could not find work. Nine percent did not work because

they were either ill or disabled, 14.5 percent were retired, and 12.2 percent
were taking care of their home or family. Approximately 0.01 percent never
worked. If the near-elderly are guaranteed subsidized health benefits when
they retire early, the number of workers will decline. In addition, nonwork-
ers ages fifty-five to sixty-four also will be eligible for the subsidized benefits
if they have met all of the requirements for Social Security except for age.
Although the near-elderly have lower labor-force participation rates
than do other age groups, the majority of those ages fifty-five to sixty-four
(64.1 percent) get their health insurance coverage from an employment-
based plan (Exhibit 2). This compares with 70.6 percent for persons ages

forty-five to fifty-four and 66.6 percent for persons ages twenty-five to
forty-four. The near-elderly are more likely than other age groups to have
individually purchased private insurance plans. Almost 13 percent have
such a policy, compared with 8.8 percent of persons ages forty-five to
fifty-four, and 7.1 percent of persons ages twenty-five to forty-four. The
near-elderly's high rate of individual coverage is a result of their weak
attachment to the labor force and their increased likelihood of being
disabled. They are less likely to have employment-based health coverage,
yet they are more likely than others to need some form of health insurance.8
The near-elderly are second only to the elderly in likelihood of having
publicly provided health insurance coverage. In 1992 more than 17 percent
of the near-elderly had some form of public coverage, compared with 10
percent of the population ages forty-five to fifty-four, and 9.8 percent of the
population ages twenty-five to forty-four. The major source of public insur-
ance for the near-elderly is Medicare; the near-elderly are more likely to
have Medicare coverage because they are more likely to be disabled and to
qualify for the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program. Be-
cause of their higher disability rates, the near-elderly are less likely than
other nonelderly age groups to participate in the labor force.
The near-elderly were less likely than other nonelderly age groups to be
uninsured in 1992. Less than 13 percent of the population ages fifty-five to
sixty-four were uninsured, compared with 14 percent of persons ages forty-
five to fifty-four and 18.5 percent of persons ages twenty-five to forty-four.
The higher rates of insurance coverage also can be attributed to higher
SSDI participation.
Sources of health insurance coverage differ by the work status of the
near-elderly. Workers between ages fifty-five and sixty-four were most
likely to have employment-based insurance, but many nonworkers also had
employment-based coverage. For example, 40.3 percent of early retirees had
direct employment-based health insurance in 1992.9 These benefits can
come in the form of retiree health insurance under the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA).10 Interestingly,
11.5 percent of persons in this age group who were looking for work were
covered by an employment-based plan. These persons were most likely
using COBRA coverage as a bridge during job turnover.
Cost Of Providing Health Benefits To Early Retirees
Data and methods. We used the March 1993 supplement to the Cur-
rent Population Survey (CPS) to provide estimates of the federal govern-
ment's cost of providing subsidized health care benefits to nonworkers ages
fifty-five to sixty-four. The CPS is the most detailed nationally repre-

sentative survey providing data on economic and demographic variables,
including health insurance coverage, early retirement, and pension plan
participation.
To provide a range of estimates of the costs of insuring early retirees, it is
necessary to predict the number of people who will be induced to leave the
labor force. We also must know how many persons have already stopped
working and would qualify for Social Security benefits at age sixty-five. We
used results obtained by Jonathan Gruber and Brigitte Madrian to estimate
the effects of induced early retirement.11 These researchers found that state
laws mandating the availability of COBRA-type continuation of coverage
for one year result in a 20-60 percent increase in the probability that a
person age fifty-five to sixty-four will retire early. Since there are strong
incentives to retire early when state laws mandate continuation of cover-
age, we would expect even greater effects under the presidents reform
package because continuation of coverage would be guaranteed for a longer
period of time and the cost savings to early retirees would be even greater.
The Clinton administration has estimated that under the president's
proposal, the cost of an indemnity plan for a single adult would be $1,932
in 1994. Other researchers have presented alternative estimates. For exam-
ple, the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) estimated a premium
of $2,202. Researchers from The Wyatt Company estimated a premium of
$2,285; Hewitt Associates estimated the premium to be $2,440; and the
Health Insurance Association of America (HIAA) estimated a premium of
$2,509.12 As mentioned above, the federal government's share of the pre-
mium would be 80 percent; therefore, we used 80 percent of the lowest
estimate ($1,547) and 80 percent of the highest estimate ($2,007) to derive
a range of estimates of the federal government's cost of providing health
benefits to early retirees.
Based upon data from the March 1993 CPS, we calculated a retirement
rate of 6.9 percent, representing 820,000 early retirees ages fifty-five to
sixty-four, and assumed that if the number of early retirees does not change,
6.9 percent of workers in this age group would retire in any given year.
Exhibit 3 presents the results of our cost simulations under various assump-
tions about the premium level and the retirement effects of workers. We
give estimates based upon three assumptions about the retirement effects of
workers combined with two assumptions about the number of nonworkers
who also would qualify for subsidized benefits.
Results. Our estimates of the costs to the federal government of provid-
ing subsidized benefits to early retirees and nonworkers range from $9.1
billion to $19.6 billion. Approximately 90 percent of workers ages fifty-five
to sixty-four would currently qualify for Social Security benefits; therefore,
we weight our estimates by 90 percent.13 Because we do not know how

many nonworkers would qualify for subsidized benefits, we use 50 percent as
a lower bound and 90 percent as an upper bound to derive a range of costs.
When we assume that workers do not respond to the added incentives to
retire, the cost of providing health benefits to workers who would have
retired even without the subsidized benefits is $1.2 billion under the low
premium and $1.5 billion under the high premium. This simulation allows
us to put a lower bound on the cost estimate, even though we expect some
change in the number of workers who retire. For nonworkers, assuming that
50 percent would qualify for subsidized benefits, we find that the cost to the
federal government for providing the benefits to the nonworkers is $7.9
billion under the low premium and $10.3 billion under the high premium.14
If 90 percent of the nonworkers qualified for subsidized benefits, the cost to
the federal government for subsidizing nonworkers would be $11.4 billion
under the low premium. The cost for nonworkers jumps to $14.8 billion
under the high premium.
The model also is simulated using a moderate level of induced retirement
for workers, based on previous research. Gruber and Madrian found that
one year of COBRA-type continuation of coverage results in an increase of
1.5 percentage points in the probability of retiring early. Under the presi-

dent's health reform plan, early retirees would be guaranteed subsidized
benefits until age sixty-five; thus, we use the average number of months
until a person reaches age sixty-five to predict the probability of retiring
early. Based on Gruber and Madrian's research, the moderate probability of
retiring early becomes 15.9 percent (up from 6.9 percent), representing 1.3
million additional early retirees, and the cost of providing health benefits to
early retirees ranges from $2.9 billion to $3.8 billion, depending upon the
level of the premium.
A large retirement effect among current workers is also possible. Gruber
and Madrian do not control for the additional effects that occur when the
federal government subsidizes 80 percent of the cost of community-rated
health insurance premiums. Under a continuation-of-coverage mandate,
group-rated health insurance will be available for only approximately eight-
een months; under the president's plan, continuation of coverage will be
available until age sixty-five at only 20 percent of the average weighted
community-rated premium.15 This lower price of health insurance should
have some additional effects on the cost to the federal government of
providing subsidized benefits to early retirees. Assuming that the largest
possible response to the guaranteed benefits package would be a 20 percent
increase in the number of workers who decide to retire early (representing
1.8 million additional early retirees), we find that the range of costs to the
federal government of providing benefits to workers who are induced to
retire becomes $3.7 billion under the low premium and $4.8 billion under
the high premium.16
Policy Implications
There are several reasons for the range of cost estimates we have derived
for early retiree coverage. Costs are incurred because approximately 6.9
percent of the near-elderly population retires each year. Under the Clinton
plan, additional costs will be incurred when workers retire because the
federal government will pay a majority of the costs of the guaranteed
benefits. Nonworkers who have met the Social Security covered-quarters
requirement also will be covered under the president's reform plan. All of
these costs are uncertain because the level of induced retirement, the
number of qualifying nonworkers, and the actual premium costs cannot be
precisely estimated. The lowest total annual cost the federal government
would face is $9.1 billion, assuming that the premium is $1,932, additional
workers do not retire early, and only 50 percent of nonworkers qualify for
the subsidized benefits. Under the assumptions that the premium for a
single adult is $2,509, 20 percent of workers retire early, and 90 percent of
the nonworking population ages fifty-five to sixty-four qualifies for subsi-

dized benefits, the highest total annual cost the federal government would
face becomes $19.6 billion.
While we know that the costs to the federal government of providing
these benefits are large and that workers will retire early if they are guaran-
teed subsidized health care benefits, these benefits also will change the
process of retirement. If a person now retires early, he or she can always
return to work. Some workers use early retirement as a way to ease them-
selves out of the labor force. Many of these workers retire only partially,
finding part-time work until they are closer to age sixty-five. Under the
Health Security Act, retired persons would lose their subsidized benefits if
they returned to work. The proposed employer mandate would inhibit early
retirees from returning to work because as employees they would not get
subsidized benefits and their employers would have to provide them with
health benefits. The human capital costs also must be accounted for when
estimating the costs of providing subsidized benefits to workers ages fifty-
five to sixty-four.
NOTES
1. The Health Security Act, if passed, would be fully implemented by 1998, but some
states would have the option to participate beginning in 1996.
2. To qualify for Social Security benefits, a person must have worked at least forty quarters
in Social Security-covered jobs. Under the president's proposal, single adults ages
fifty-five to sixty-four with income over $90,000 and married couples with joint income
of more than $115,000 would have to repay the subsidy at tax time. Only 2 percent of
nonworking individuals ages fifty-five to sixty-four would have to repay the subsidy.
The estimates presented here do not account for these persons because their effect on
the total costs to the federal government is very small.
3. The weighted average premium represents the average premium of all available health
plans in an alliance weighted by the number of persons enrolled in each plan.
4. See J. Davis, Retiree Health Benefits: Issues of Structure, Financing, and Coverage, Issue
Brief 112 (Washington: Employee Benefit Research Institute, March 1991 ) for ways in
which employers now fund retiree health benefits.
5. For a discussion of the transition to retirement, see C.J. Ruhm, The Work and Retirement
Patterns of Older Americans, Issue Brief 121 (Washington: EBRI, December 1991).
6. Between 1955 and 1985 the labor-force participation rate of males ages fifty-five to
sixty-four declined by more than 19 percent, compared with a 4.5 percent decrease for
males ages forty-five to fifty-four. Some researchers attribute this decline to an increase
in the ease of qualifying for disability benefits. See D.O. Parsons, "The Decline in Male
Labor Force Participation,"Journal ofPolitical Economy (February 1980): 117-134; and

decline in the male labor-force participation rate.

twelve months. In addition, there is a mandatory five-month waiting period before
disability benefits begin; therefore, disabled persons are more likely to need some form
of individual coverage in the interim.
9. Direct employment-based coverage is coverage in one's own name. Indirect employ-
ment-based coverage is coverage provided through someone else's employer.
10. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985 requires
employers with health insurance plans to offer continued access to group health
insurance to qualified beneficiaries. COBRA requires continued access for eighteen
months for employees (twenty-nine months for the disabled) and thirty-six months for
qualifying spouses and dependent children. Some states also have continuation-of-
coverage laws. See EBRI, Fundamentals of Employee Benefit Programs, 4th ed. (Wash-
ington: EBRI, 1990), for more information about the federal law; and J. Gruber and

based upon individual characteristics, whether or not the person had employment-
based health insurance, whether the person was covered by a pension plan, and the
number of months for which the person's state of residence mandated continuation of
health insurance. We adjust their equation to reflect the number of months until a
person qualifies for Medicare, which reflects COBRA-type continuation of coverage
until age sixty-five. We generalize their results to females, although this may overstate
the retirement effects of females.

House Domestic Policy Council, 1993); EBRI simulations using the March 1993
supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the 1987 National Medical
Expenditure Survey, adjusted for inflation and imputed to the CPS; The Wyatt
Company, The Economics of Health Reform (Report prepared for the Business Council
on National Health Policy, January 1994); testimony of Dale Yamamoto and Frank
McArdle, Hewitt Associates, House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health
and the Environment, 22 November 1993; and Health Insurance Association of

13. We use data from the 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to
determine the number of workers ages fifty-five to sixty-four now qualifying for Social
Security.
14. Based on our data for workers, for nonworking persons reporting that they are retired,
we assume that approximately 90 percent of the nonworkers would qualify for Social
Security at age sixty-five.
15. This will be longer for persons in some states with continuation-of-coverage law lengths
that exceed the federal government length set in COBRA.
16. The Clinton administration gives estimates for induced retirement in the range of
350,000 to 600,000, yielding a figure of $10 billion in government costs for retiree
benefits, based on 1998 estimates. Analysis conducted by the Congressional Budget
Office also suggests effects within this range, but closer to the upper end. CBO, An
Analysis of the Administration's Health Proposal (Washington: CBO, February 1994).
Both the CBO and the administration's estimates are roughly consistent with the results
in B. Madrian, "Labor Market Effects of Employment-Based Health Insurance" (Doc-
toral dissertation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1993). Our range is based
upon estimates in Gruber and Madrian, who suggest much larger responses. Gruber and
Madrian, "Health Insurance Availability and the Retirement Decision."
