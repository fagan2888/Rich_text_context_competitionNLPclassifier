Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 accounts for about half of cervical
cancers worldwide. This study investigated the seroepidemiology of HPV-16 infection in the
United States by using a population-based survey. Serum samples and questionnaire data
were collected from 1991 to 1994 for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys.
HPV-16­specific IgG antibody was detected by use of an HPV-16 virus-like particle ELISA.
HPV-16 seropositivity in the US population aged 12­59 years was 13.0% (95% confidence
interval, 11.5%­14.7%). Seroprevalence was higher in women (17.9%) than in men (7.9%). Age,
race/ethnicity, and number of lifetime sex partners were associated with HPV seropositivity
in women. Race/ethnicity, age at first intercourse, urban/nonurban residence, years of sexual
activity, and having had sex with a man were associated with HPV seropositivity in men.
Information on HPV-16 seroepidemiology will be important for designing prevention efforts
including vaccine programs.
Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most
common sexually transmitted infection in the United States [1,
2]. At least 30 HPV types infect the genital area, and persistent
infection with high-risk HPV types is the strongest risk factor
for cervical cancer. High-risk HPV types, including 16, 18, 31,
33, and 35, are found in up to 93% of cervical cancers world-
wide, and HPV-16 accounts for 50% [3­6].
Assessing the extent of genital HPV infection in the US pop-
ulation has been difficult for many reasons. HPV does not grow
in tissue culture, closely related types cause different diseases
(e.g., cervical cancer and genital warts), and most infections
are asymptomatic. No surveillance systems exist, and no large
population-based prevalence surveys have been feasible. Cur-
rent knowledge of HPV prevalence and risk factors is based
largely on measuring viral DNA in genital epithelial cells. How-

ever, HPV DNA detection is limited by sampling methodology
and reflects only current status; HPV DNA becomes unde-
tectable within 2 years in most women [7]. Serologic testing is
a better measure of cumulative exposure, and type-specific se-
rologic assays have become available in recent years. Corre-
lations between assays for IgG antibodies to HPV-16 capsids
and detection of HPV DNA, high-grade cervical neoplasia, and
number of lifetime sex partners indicate that seroassays are
useful epidemiologic research tools [8­10].
Seroepidemiologic data also are useful for establishing prev-
alence of infection in the general population and for identifying
groups at highest risk for targeting prevention and clinical ser-
vices. We report here the results of a national seroepidemiologic
survey of HPV-16 infection performed on surplus serum sam-
ples from the second phase of the third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), conductedfrom
1991 to 1994.
Methods
Study populations and study design. The NHANES is a series
of cross-sectional national surveys conducted by the National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). These surveys use a complex, stratified, mul-
tistage, probability cluster design to select a representative sample
of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population [11].
NHANES III was conducted in 1988­1994 in 2 3-year phases.
NHANES III oversampled children aged !5 years, persons aged 60
years, Mexican Americans, and blacks. For this analysis, race/eth-
nicity was defined by self-report as non-Hispanic white and non-
Hispanic black (referred to as "white" and "black" in the text), and
JID 2002;186 (15 November) HPV-16 Seroprevalence 1397
Mexican American. Persons who did not identify themselves in these
categories were classified as "other." The poverty index was calcu-
lated by dividing the total family income by the poverty threshold,
as defined by the US Census [12], with adjustment for family size at
the time of the interview. Urban residence was defined as residing in
a county in a metropolitan area; all other counties were defined as
"nonurban." Limited sexual history questions were asked of ado-
lescents aged 15­16 years. A more extensive sexual behavior ques-
tionnaire was administered to participants aged 17­59 years.Alcohol,
cocaine, and marijuana use questions were asked of study subjects
aged 12 years.
Response rates in the NHANES III have been described else-
where [13]. We tested serum samples available from the second
phase of the NHANES III conducted during 1991­1994. Of the
9629 subjects selected to participate in the survey in the 12- to 59-
year age group, 7476 (77.6%) agreed to the examination; from these
participants, 7218 serum samples were available for HPV testing
(96.5% of examined persons).
Serologic testing. Serologic testing for HPV-16 was performed
at the CDC. Virus-like particles (VLPs) were produced by expres-
sion of an HPV-16 L1 recombinant baculovirus in insect cells, as
described elsewhere [14, 15]. ELISAs were standardized and per-
formed as described elsewhere [14]. In brief, purified VLPs were
pooled as a single lot sufficient to complete the entire study and
were aliquoted and frozen at 70C until use. Microtiter plates
(Immulon II; Dynatech Laboratories) were coated overnight with
0.1 mg/well VLPs. Plates were washed with Tween 20
PBS  0.1%
(PBST) and were blocked for 1 h with diluent (10 mM Tris plus
0.15 M NaCl [pH 8.0], 10% goat serum [Life Technologies], 50%
SuperBlock [Pierce]) containing 0.5% Tween 20. Plates were washed
with PBST and were incubated with 50 mL of serum (1:20 in diluent
plus 10% insect cell lysate) per well at 37C for 1 h. Plates were
again washed with PBST and were detected by use of alkaline
phosphatase­conjugated goat anti­human IgG antibody (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals) and alkaline phosphatase substrate
(Phosphatase; Sigma). Raw absorbance values were detected at 405
nm in an automated plate reader (Dynex MRX II Revelation).
Each serum sample was tested in duplicate wells. For a given sam-
ple, if the SD of the absorbance value of either well was 125% of
the mean absorbance value of the duplicate wells, testing was
repeated.
For quality control and evaluation, we used known positive and
negative human serum samples (gifts of M. Hagensee, Louisiana
State University, and H. Strickler, National Cancer Institute [now at
Albert Einstein School of Medicine]). Additional negative serum
samples were obtained from Egleston Children's Hospital (Atlanta).
Control serum samples also were used to prepare pools of high-
positive, low-positive, and negative serum controls. The pooled con-
trols were used to monitor day-to-day and plate-to-plate variation.
Results for individual control serum samples that were run
throughout the course of the NHANES III analysis were used in
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine the
ELISA cutoff value for discrimination between positive and nega-
tive samples [14, 16]. Evaluation of ROC plots indicated that a
cutoff value of 0.64 absorbance resulted in 93% sensitivity and
98.5% specificity. Type-specific serologic testing for herpes simplex
virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 was performed at Emory University by
immunodot assays based on purified glycoproteins gG1 and gG2
by methods described elsewhere [17, 18].
Statistical analysis. We explored bivariate associations with
HPV seropositivity and the following demographic, social, sexual,
and reproductive variables for women and men separately: age,
marital status, race/ethnicity, residence, region (Northeast, Mid-
west, South, West), education level, poverty index, use of tobacco,
alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine, early age at first intercourse(defined
as !18 years), number of sex partners (lifetime and past year), years
of sexual activity (calculated by subtracting age at first intercourse
from age at study enrollment), and HSV-1 and HSV-2 seropositiv-
ity. In addition, for women we considered the number of live births,
oral contraceptive use, and cervical cancer; for men, we considered
whether the man reported ever having sex with other men.
Prevalence estimates were weighted to represent the total US pop-
ulation and to account for oversampling and nonresponse to the
household interview and physical examination [19, 20]. Persons miss-
ing HPV test results were significantly younger than those with HPV
results; therefore, the weights provided by NCHS were further ad-
justed by using the weighted proportion of response in each age group
and then were poststratified by age, race/ethnicity, and sex. These
adjusted weights were used for the prevalence estimates and for the
logistic regression model to identify variables associated with HPV
seropositivity. The confidence intervals (CIs) for the prevalence es-
timates were calculated on the basis of log transformation with the
SE of the log prevalence calculated by use of the delta method [21].
The SEs for the prevalence estimates were obtained by using SU-
DAAN software [22]. Similarly, approximate SEs of prevalenceratios
were calculated by use of the delta method based on the log of the
prevalence ratio by use of SEs from SUDAAN.
We used logistic regression to determine variables that were in-
dependently associated with HPV-16 antibodies in sexually active
men and women separately. Participants whose race/ethnicity cat-
egory was "other" were excluded from these analyses because of
small sample sizes. The initial logistic model included all demo-
graphic variables with a bivariate Wald x2 statistic P value .05.
After these variables were entered into the model, we used the
Satterthwaite-adjusted x2 to determine statistical significance at the
level. Variables in the model that were statistically signif-
P p .05
icant remained in the model; other variables were omitted if there
was no evidence of data-based confounding (130% change in the
parameter estimate). A step-up logistic regression model was fitted
where pairwise interactions were added to the remaining main ef-
fects in the logistic model and were considered to be statistically
significant if the Satterthwaite-adjusted x2 .

Results
Overall, 13.0% (95% CI, 11.5­14.7; table 1) of study partici-
pants aged 12­59 years had antibodies to HPV-16. Seropreva-
lence was significantly higher in women (17.9%) than in men
(7.9%), yielding a female:male prevalence ratio of 2.3 (95% CI,
1.8­2.9). Seroprevalence was 12.5% among whites, 19.1% among
blacks, and 8.9% among Mexican Americans. With increasing
age, HPV-16 seroprevalence increased in women to 24.7% at ages
20­29 years and then declined to 11.0% after age 49 years. In

men, seroprevalence peaked later, at ages 30­39 years (11.5%)
and was sustained throughout the older age groups.
In women, HPV-16 seropositivity was significantly associated
with several variables (tables 1 and 2), including age, race/
ethnicity, education, alcohol use, marijuana use (ever), cocaine
use (ever), ever having sexual intercourse, early age at first
intercourse, number of lifetime sex partners, number of sex
partners during the past year, HSV-2 seropositivity, and oral
contraceptive use (ever). These variables were further explored
by logistic regression. No statistically significant differences in
HPV-16 seropositivity were found for marital status, residence,
region, poverty index, tobacco use, number of live births, years
of sexual activity, or HSV-1 seropositivity.
In the logistic model, age, race/ethnicity, marijuana smoking
(ever), and age at first sexual intercourse were significantly as-
sociated with HPV-16 seropositivity before adding number of
lifetime sexual partners into the model. However, after includ-
ing number of lifetime partners in the model, marijuana smok-
ing (ever) and age at first sexual intercourse were no longer
statistically significant and were dropped from the model. No
other variables were statistically significant or important con-
founding variables when added to this model.
Next, we fitted a step-up logistic regression model and added
pairwise interactions to the main effects model. No pairwise in-
teractions were statistically significant. Because of the limited
degrees of freedom in this complex survey setting, age and num-
ber of lifetime partners were treated as continuous variables to
assess any interactions. The final model appears in table 3.
In men, HPV-16 seropositivity was significantlyassociatedwith
several variables (tables 1 and 2), including age, race/ethnicity,
marital status, poverty index, residence, age at first intercourse,
years of sexual activity, number of lifetime sex partners, number
of sex partners during the past year, and having sex with a man.
These variables were subsequently explored by logisticregression.
No statistically significant differences in HPV-16 seropositivity
were found for region, education, tobacco use, cocaine use, al-
cohol use, ever having sex, or HSV-1 or -2 seropositivity. In the
logistic model, we recoded age as a dichotomous variable (!30
years vs. 30 years), since the log odds estimates were similar
for men aged 12­29 years, and for those aged 30 years. Dem-
ographic variables that remained statistically significant in the
logistic model were age, residence, and race/ethnicity. The other
demographic variables did not appear to be important confound-
ing variables and hence were omitted from the model. Next,
sexual variables with statistically significantbivariateassociations
were added. Only age at first sexual intercourse, years of sexual
activity, and having sex with men remained statistically signifi-
cant. No other variables appeared to be confounders. Although
age was no longer statistically significant, it was retained in the
final model since it appeared to be confounded with years of
sexual activity. Next, a step-up logistic regression model wasfitted
where pairwise interactions were added to the main effectsmodel.
One interaction, race/ethnicity and residence, was statisticallysig-
nificant. The final logistic model appears in table 4.
Discussion
These findings document the high levels of HPV-16 infection
in the United States, especially in women. In each racial/ethnic
group, seropositivity was at least 2 times higher in women than
in men, and seropositivity was high even in women who re-
ported only 1 sex partner over their lifetime. Differences in
seropositivity between men and women were not unexpected,
since anatomic and other biologic differences usually portend
greater susceptibility to most sexually transmitted diseases for
women than for men. For example, higher transmission risk
from men to women for gonorrhea and HSV-2 [23­27] and
higher population-based prevalence of gonorrhea, chlamydia,
and HSV-2 seropositivity in women are well documented [17,
28]. However, the most likely explanation for higher HPV-16
seropositivity in women is that women and men have funda-
mental differences in immune response after exposure [29­33].
Previous studies [32­35] found higher HPV-16 seroprevalence
and higher mean ELISA values for women than for men. In

men, HPV infections may be more transient, and infection in
men often involves keratinized epithelium that may be less likely
than mucosal epithelium to induce a humoral immune response
[32, 34]. Anorectal mucosal exposure may be more likely to
produce a detectable immune response and could contribute to
the high seropositivity in men who had sex with men.
We found associations between HPV-16 seropositivity and
sexual behavior in women and men, and age in women. Al-
though HPV DNA detection is strongly age-dependent in
women [2, 36, 37], seroprevalence studies in men and women
have not shown consistent associations with age [8, 32­34,
38­41] and, in general, have not shown the expected linear
associations that are consistently seen for HSV-2 infection [42].
The strong association between HPV-16 seropositivity and
number of lifetime sex partners and no association with number
of recent partners observed in our study have been reported
elsewhere [8, 10, 32­34, 38, 39] and suggest seropositivity is a
measure of lifetime rather than of recent exposure.
Seropositivity in persons who reported no sex partners may
be explained by underreporting of sexual behavior [43, 44],
vertical or other nonsexual transmission, including oral and
nongenital infection [45­48], or false-positive serologic tests.
Underreporting of sexual activity is likely, especially since the
questionnaire did not define sexual intercourse. Oral-genital
and manual-genital contact could transmit HPV infection yet
might not be reported as sexual intercourse [43, 44, 49]. Low
levels of HPV-16 seropositivity have been observed in those
who have not had intercourse and children in previous studies
that used similar serologic assays [50, 51].
The HPV-16 seroprevalence observed in our study probably
underestimates the cumulative prevalence of HPV-16 infection
in the United States for several reasons. First, not all persons
who become infected with HPV-16 develop a serologicresponse.
Previous studies in women showed that !60% of those with
newly detectable HPV-16 DNA develop HPV-16 antibodies
[52], with a median lag time to seroconversion of 11.8 months.
Second, duration of seropositivity is not well defined. A study
of 11 women showed that levels of antibodies to HPV-16 per-
sisted for the 7­13-year follow-up period [53]. Another study
of 1656 pregnant women showed that antibody levels were sta-
ble during a 4-year follow-up period [54]. Whether persistence
of antibodies differs across demographic groups has not been
studied. We are not aware of any published data on persistence
of antibodies in men.
Our findings have important public health implications for the
development of cervical cancer prevention and control strategies.
National HPV seroprevalence data will be valuable for HPV
vaccine research and for development of HPV vaccine programs.
Prophylactic vaccines for HPV-16 based on L1 virus-likeparticles
show great promise, and vaccine development is well underway.
Topics under debate include whether to vaccinate women only
or perhaps men only, the ideal age at vaccination, and which
types of HPV to include in a vaccine [55, 56]. Our national data
on seroepidemiology of naturally occurring HPV-16 infection is
useful to establish baseline HPV-16 seroprevalence in demo-
graphic groups, to highlight differences in humoral immune re-
sponses between men and women, and to document a high bur-
den of infection with this single HPV type. Moreover, a system
for monitoring seroprevalence over time will be valuable to assess
effectiveness of vaccine programs.
