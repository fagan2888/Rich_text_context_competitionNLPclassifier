ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine the association between
diabetes mellitus (DM) and marijuana use.
Design: Cross-sectional study.
Setting: Data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988e1994)
conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics
of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Participants: The study included participants of the
NHANES III, a nationally representative sample of the
US population. The total analytic sample was 10 896
adults. The study included four groups (n¼10 896):
non-marijuana users (61.0%), past marijuana users
(30.7%), light (one to four times/month) (5.0%) and
heavy (more than five times/month) current marijuana
users (3.3%). DM was defined based on self-report or
abnormal glycaemic parameters. We analysed data
related to demographics, body mass index, smoking
status, alcohol use, total serum cholesterol, high-
density lipoprotein, triglyceride, serum 25-hydroxy
vitamin D, plasma haemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma
glucose level and the serum levels of C reactive protein
and four additional inflammatory markers as related to
marijuana use.
Main outcome measures: OR for DM associated
with marijuana use adjusted for potential confounding
variables (ie, odds of DM in marijuana users compared
with non-marijuana users).
Results: Marijuana users had a lower age-adjusted
prevalence of DM compared to non-marijuana users
(OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.55; p<0.0001). The
prevalence of elevated C reactive protein (>0.5 mg/dl)
was significantly higher (p<0.0001) among non-
marijuana users (18.9%) than among past (12.7%) or
current light (15.8%) or heavy (9.2%) users. In
a robust multivariate model controlling for socio-
demographic factors, laboratory values and
comorbidity, the lower odds of DM among marijuana
users was significant (adjusted OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.24
to 0.55; p<0.0001).
Conclusions: Marijuana use was independently
associated with a lower prevalence of DM. Further
studies are needed to show a direct effect of marijuana
on DM.
INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus
(DM) is increasing, and it is projected that in
the USA alone, type 2 DM will increase to
48.3 million by 2050.1 In addition to defects

ARTICLE SUMMARY
Article focus
- We hypothesised that the prevalence of DM
would be reduced in marijuana users due to the
presence of one or more cannabinoids because
of their immunomodulatory and anti-inflamma-
tory properties.
Key messages
- Marijuana use was associated with a decreased
prevalence of DM.
- Prospective studies in rodents and humans are
needed to determine a causal relationship
between cannabinoid receptor activation and DM.
- Until those studies are performed, we do not
advocate the use of marijuana in patients at risk
for DM.
Strengths and limitations of this study
- Population-based national representative sample
of the USA.
- Cross-sectional data.
- Marijuana use was based on self-report, and self-
report of illicit substances is often underesti-
mated on self-reports. Self-report is subjected to
recall bias. However, we expect that recall bias
would be similar in those with DM as those
without DM and would be unlikely to bias our
results.
- Although current marijuana users were divided
into heavy and light users based on the number
of times they reported using marijuana per
month, the amount of marijuana consumed,
route of consumption (inhaled vs oral), duration
of use and time when they quit were not
reported.

Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in
the USA and is currently used by 14.4 million Ameri-
cans.3 The Cannabis sativa (marijuana) plant contains
bioactive components termed cannabinoids (CB). The
major psychoactive CB is delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) whose effect is mediated through the CB1 and
the CB2 subtypes of CB receptors found in the brain and
lymphoid tissues.4 The endocannabinoids, a group of
neuromodulatory lipids also bind to these receptors.5
Cannabis, THC and other CBs have been shown to have
both beneficial6 and detrimental effects.7 Marijuana
users have higher caloric intake while eating less
nutrient-rich foods,8 yet have similar8 or slightly lower9
body mass index (BMI) than non users.
We hypothesised that the prevalence of DM would be
reduced in marijuana users due to the presence of one
or more CBs because of their immunomodulatory and
anti-inflammatory properties.4 We assessed the associa-
tion between DM and marijuana use among adults
aged 20e59 years in a national sample of the general
population.
METHODS
Study population
The study included participants of the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III),10
conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics
of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
NHANES III used a highly stratified multistage proba-
bility sampling (total N¼39 695) and employed over-
sampling of the older people (N¼2273), non-Hispanic
blacks (N¼11 061) and Mexican Americans (N¼11 110).
Descriptions of the survey, sampling procedures
and details of the laboratory tests evaluated can
be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prev-
ention website (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/
nh3rrm.htm#refman).
We limited the analysis to adults aged 20e59 years, as
those <20 years did not have plasma glucose testing and
only participants up to 60 years old were asked about
marijuana use. In addition, we excluded those with
missing laboratory data. The total analytic sample was
10 896 adults (complete data for marijuana use and
DM). Subjects with missing data for the laboratory vari-
ables (n¼2769) were excluded, and the number for the
final model was 8127 adults. A flow diagram showing the
number of subjects selected and reasons for exclusion is
listed in supplement figure 1.
Study variables
Data on marijuana use were collected by self-report.
Non-marijuana users included never users (n¼6667) and
those who reported ever having used marijuana, but who
had not used marijuana in the past month (ie, past
users) (n¼3346). We classified participants who reported
using marijuana in the past month by frequency of use as
either light current users (#4 days per month (n¼557))
or heavy current users ($5 days per month (n¼326)) as
previously described.9 The definition of marijuana for
purposes of this survey includes `hash,' `pot' or `grass' or
any other references to the Cannabis plant. The phrase
`used marijuana' refers to either smoking or ingesting
marijuana.
Subjects were defined as having DM if they answer `yes'
to the question `Have you ever been told you have
sugar/diabetes?' (n¼525) or had a fasting blood glucose
level $126 mg/dl (n¼194). Of the 719 patients with
DM, 418 answered the question about whether they take
insulin and 116 reported that they do take insulin. Of
those, nine reported that they began using insulin at age
#20 years, the majority being likely to have type 1 DM,
although a few may have had type 2 DM. Thus, we esti-
mate that 1.5% of patients with DM (unadjusted) had
type 1 DM, and because of this low number, we analysed
all subjects with DM together. There was no difference in
any of our analyses if the nine patients of age #20 years
were excluded.
The study included 151 pregnant women (1.5%). Of
them, eight women had diabetes. There was no differ-
ence in the use of marijuana by DM. Because of the low
number in the diabetes category, we included them in
the analysis. A series of sensitivity analyses excluding the
pregnant women showed no difference.
Plasma glucose and whole blood haemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c) were measured at the University of Missouri-
Columbia School of Medicine Department of Child
Health, Diabetes Reference Laboratory, Columbia,
Missouri, by David Goldstein, MD, director.11
Subjects were classified as obese/non-obese according
to the BMI level using a cut-off of 30 kg/m2.
We analysed data related to DM, age, gender, race/
ethnicity, education level, family history of DM, physical
activity, BMI, cigarette smoking, cocaine use, alcohol use,
total serum cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol,
triglycerides, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (vitamin D),
HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose level, C reactive protein
(CRP) level and the serum levels of less robust inflam-
matory markers (ferritin, fibrinogen, white blood cell
(WBC) count and uric acid) that have been previously
used in NHANES III analysis.12 Physical activity was
assessed using self-report to several questions (http://
www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nh3rrm.htm#refman). For
the physical activity variable, subjects were classified as
inactive if they did not report engaging in any of the
following activities during the previous month: walking,
jogging, bike riding, swimming, aerobics, dancing,
calisthenics, gardening, lifting weights or other physical
activity outside their occupation. Physical activity was
classified as moderate or vigorous intensity based on
metabolic equivalent intensity levels. Individuals were
considered to fulfil national recommendations for
physical activity if they reported five or more episodes

or more episodes per week of vigorous-intensity physical
activity.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to characterise the
subjects (mean and SD for continuous variables, and
percentages for categorical variables). To test the statis-
tical difference between the groups, we used c2 test for
categorical variables and two-sided t tests for continuous
variables. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant.
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses
(for categorical outcomedDM/no DM) were used to
determine the relationship between DM and marijuana
use. We used multivariate logistic regression to adjust for
confounding variables and reported the OR and the
95% CI. Variables considered as possible confounders in
the multivariate analysis were age, gender, race/
ethnicity, BMI, education level, cigarette smoking,
alcohol use, physical activity, serum total cholesterol,
HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, vitamin
D, CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen, WBC count and uric acid. In
order to confirm that marijuana use was associated with
DM and not due to confounders, we analysed how each
potential confounder changed the OR of having DM.
Variables that changed the OR by $10% were consid-
ered as confounders and included in the multivariate
model.
We performed stratified analysis to test for effect
modification. For effect modifier variable, multivariate
logistic regression model was constructed for each
subgroup.
In addition, to help adjust for selection bias, we
analysed the data using the propensity score matching
and estimated the average treatment effect for the
treated, bootstrap SE and t statistics. We added the
propensity score to the logistic regression model as
inverse weight, blocks (N¼8) that satisfy the balancing
property and quartiles.
Data were analysed using SAS (Release V.9.1.3, 2002;
SAS, Inc.) and the survey module of STATA (Release
V.10, 1984e2007 Statistics/Data Analysis; StataCorp).
Sample weights, provided by the National Center for
Health Statistics, were used to correct for differential
selection probabilities and to adjust for non-coverage
and non-response.13
RESULTS
Among NHANES III participants aged 20e59 years,
there were 6667 (54.5%) non-marijuana users, 3346
(36.7%) past marijuana users, 557 (5.5%) light current
users and 326 (3.3%) heavy current users. As shown in
table 1, current and past marijuana users tended to be
<40 years old, be male, had a BMI of <30 kg/m2,
smoked cigarettes and used alcohol and cocaine more
frequently compared to non-marijuana users. Compared
to non-marijuana users, past users tended to be white
and to have a college education, while current users
included more white and black subjects and were more
likely to have a high school education or less. Non-
marijuana users, past and current marijuana users had
a similar percentage of family history of DM (p>0.05)
but significantly different percentage of physical activity
levels (p<0.001), with past and current marijuana users
being more active than non-marijuana users.
As shown in supplement table 1, marijuana users (past
and current) had a lower adjusted prevalence of DM, but
not hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction or heart
failure compared to non-marijuana users.
The unadjusted prevalence of DM for non-marijuana
users, past marijuana users, current light marijuana users
and current heavy marijuana users was 6.3%, 2.9%, 1.9%
and 3.0%, respectively, and there was a statistically
significant difference between the groups (p<0.0001)
(table 1). For subjects without DM (n¼10 165), 46.4%
were marijuana users and 53.6% were non-marijuana
users (p<0.0001) (supplement table 2). For subjects with
DM (n¼719), 26.9% were marijuana users and 73.1%
were non-marijuana users (p<0.0001). The difference in
% of marijuana users between those with and without
DM was highly significant (p<0.0001).
As shown in table 1, all marijuana users had a higher
prevalence of serum HDL cholesterol >40 mg/dl, total
cholesterol <240 mg/dl and triglycerides <200 mg/dl
compared to non-users (p<0.0001). Current marijuana
users had a higher prevalence of LDL cholesterol
<160 mg/dl (p<0.05). All marijuana users had a higher
prevalence of CRP <0.5 mg/dl (p<0.0001). Past users,
but not current users, had a lower prevalence of vitamin
D level <70 nmol/l compared to non-users (p<0.0001).
All marijuana users had a higher prevalence of plasma
HbA1c <6.0% (p<0.0001). Serum glucose levels and
BMI were lower in all marijuana user groups compared
to non-marijuana users (table 1).
We then examined the variation of markers of
inflammation with marijuana use (table 1). Serum CRP
and fibrinogen were significantly (p<0.001) lower in
past marijuana users compared to current and non-
marijuana users suggesting lower inflammation in past
marijuana users. In contrast, serum ferritin levels were
higher in past and current heavy users, and lower in light
users, compared to non-users. Serum uric acid levels
were higher in past and lower in current users compared
to non-users. WBC count was higher among current
users relative to non-users and past users.
In order to confirm that marijuana use was associated
with a decreased prevalence of DM and not due to
confounders, we analysed how each potential
confounder changed the OR of having DM. Variables
that changed the OR by $10% were considered as
confounders (addition of age, BMI, alcohol use, total
cholesterol, triglyceride, CRP and hypertension changed
the OR by $10% from 0.42 to 0.60, 0.49, 0.50, 0.46, 0.47,
0.46, 0.46, respectively) (supplement table 3). Table 2
shows the unadjusted as well as the cumulative effect of
the confounders, including race/ethnicity, physical

users relative to non-users in a series of regression
models. Of note, race/ethnicity and physical activity did
not change the OR by $10%, but we included them in
the model because they are known risk factors. The
interaction effect of the marijuana use and age was

modifier (ie, the association between DM and marijuana
use was modified by age and the association differed for
different age groups) (OR for interaction¼1.83, 95% CI

tion of DM and marijuana was significant in both the

95% confidence level¼0.40 to 0.73, p¼0.001). Adding it
as inverse weight, yielded an OR¼0.52 (95% confidence
level¼0.39 to 0.71, p¼0.001). We also added it as blocks
(N¼8) and found an OR¼0.53 (95% confidence
level¼0.40 to 0.73, p¼0.001). Adding it as quartiles
yielded an OR¼0.51 (95% confidence level¼0.38 to
0.69, p¼0.001). All still revealed a lower odds of DM with
marijuana use. For age group 41e59 years, adding the
propensity score as quartiles to the model, we found an
OR¼0.55 (95% confidence level¼0.35 to 0.88, p¼0.012),
whereas for age group 20e40 years, OR¼0.88 (95%
confidence level¼0.53 to 1.47, p>0.05).
We examine whether DM as diagnosed by self-report as
compared to laboratory evidence of hyperglycaemia was
correlated with different prevalence of marijuana use. As
shown in the supplement table 2, there was no differ-
ence in marijuana use among those with DM by self-
report and those with DM who were included based on
an elevated fasting glucose (p¼0.43). Patients with DM
by self-report who were hyperglycaemic (fasting glucose
$126 mg/dl) at the time of sampling had a statistically
similar rate of marijuana use as those whose DM was well
controlled (fasting glucose <126 mg/dl) at the time of
sampling (p¼0.06), although there was a trend for
patients with a history of DM by self-report who were
euglycaemia at the time of sampling to be associated
with a lower rate of non-marijuana use. Those with DM
by self-report and those with DM who were included
based on an elevated fasting glucose had similar rates of
the type of marijuana use (heavy current users, light
current users and past users). Additionally, for subjects
who did not have DM by self-report and did not have an
elevated fasting glucose level but had an elevated HbA1c
(>7.0%) (n¼22), their prevalence of non-marijuana use
(72.2%) was similar to the prevalence of non-marijuana
use among subjects with DM (73.1%).
We then examined the prevalence of all marijuana
users among subjects with different fasting glucose
levels. As shown in figure 1, the highest prevalence of
marijuana users was found in those with the lowest
glucose levels. As the glucose levels increased, the prev-
alence of marijuana users decreased. For subjects with
DM (fasting glucose >125 mg/dl), the prevalence of
marijuana users was 23.6%. Similarly, the highest preva-
lence of marijuana users was found in those subjects with
the lowest plasma HbA1c values (figure 2). As the HbA1c
levels increased, the prevalence of marijuana users
decreased.
Furthermore, we analysed the data using logistic
regression to assess the odds of having DM, an elevated
glucose value or an elevated HbA1c for the categories of
marijuana use. The OR for all marijuana users to have
DM was 0.42 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.55), which was statistically
significant (ie, marijuana non-users were 2.4 times more
likely to have DM relative to all marijuana users). Rela-
tive to non-marijuana users, past marijuana users had an
OR of having DM of 0.44 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.59), current
light marijuana users had an OR of 0.29 (CI 0.13 to 0.65)
and current heavy marijuana users had an OR of 0.47
(95% CI 0.22 to 0.98), all were statistically significant
from non-marijuana users (p<0.001) (figure 3). Relative
to non-marijuana users, marijuana users had

DISCUSSION
Our analyses of adults aged 20e59 years in the NHANES
III database showed that participants who used mari-
juana had lower prevalence of DM and had lower odds of
DM relative to non-marijuana users. We did not find an
association between the use of marijuana and other
chronic diseases, such as hypertension, stroke, myocar-
dial infarction and heart failure. This could be due to
the smaller prevalence of stroke, myocardial infarction
and heart failure in the examined age group.
We noted the lowest prevalence of DM in current light
marijuana users, with current heavy marijuana users and
past users also having a lower prevalence of DM than
non-marijuana users. The finding that past marijuana
users had lower odds of prevalent DM than non-users
suggests that early exposure to marijuana may affect the
development of DM and a window of time of marijuana
exposure earlier in life could be a factor to study. Simi-
larly, our findings of a significant association between
marijuana use and DM was only found in those aged
$40 years suggest that the possibility of some protection
from marijuana use may require many years before they
become manifested. By contrast, it could reflect the
increased prevalence of DM with age and the ability to
detect an association with a lesser sample size when there
is a greater cohort at risk for DM. The possible associa-
tion of light marijuana use with decreased DM is similar
to that of alcohol on DM and the metabolic syndrome, in
which mild alcohol use was associated with lower preva-
lence of DM and the metabolic syndrome,14 15 and
higher alcohol use associated with higher prevalence of
DM and the metabolic syndrome.14 16
Smit and Crespo9 used the NHANES III population to
examine dietary factors of non-marijuana users and
marijuana users among adults aged 20e59 years. Similar
to our data, they found that 45% reported used mari-
juana in their lifetime and 8.7% used marijuana in the
past month. Current marijuana users had higher intakes
of energy and nutrients and consumed more soft drinks
but had slightly lower BMI than non-current marijuana
users. Thus, it is unlikely that a healthier diet contrib-
uted to the decreased prevalence of DM among mari-
juana users found in our study. In our study, all
marijuana users had lower BMI than non-users, with
heavy marijuana users having the lowest BMI. The lower
BMI may be protective for DM, although when we
controlled for BMI, the prevalence of DM was not
significantly changed suggesting additional BMI-inde-
pendent pathways. Smit and Crespo9 did not record
glycaemic parameters or prevalence of DM.
Using NHANES III data, marijuana users had lower
rates of obesity (BMI $30) and lower mean BMI, with
current heavy marijuana users having the lowest BMI, in
agreement with a recent report using National Epide-
miologic Survey on Alcohol (2001e2002) and the
National Comorbidity SurveyeReplication (2001e2003)
databases.17 Correcting for the effect of BMI, the asso-
ciation between marijuana use and DM was reduced by
17% but remained highly significant.
We postulate that the decreased prevalence of DM and
marijuana use may be due to the anti-inflammatory
properties of marijuana. CBs found in marijuana
favourably modify inflammation probably through the
inhibitory actions on prostaglandins and COX-2.18 Hu
and colleagues2 reported that CRP, but not interleukin-6
and tumour necrosis factor-a receptor-2, was associated
with the risk of developing DM. In our study, serum level
of CRP, fibrinogen ferritin, uric acid and WBC counts
revealed varied associations with marijuana use. Of note,
the CRP assay used in NHANES III was not a highly
sensitive assay11 and is unlikely to pick up small changes
in an inflammatory state in a single individual; however,
it is still a robust measure of inflammation and is useful
in population studies.12 However, we did find a U-shaped
association between the CRP levels and marijuana use
groups.
Rodent studies using CBs have shown significant
benefits against diabetic complications and atheroscle-
rosis.19 20 Additionally, lower doses of CBs appear to be
anti-inflammatory in rodents.19 CBs, including the
non-psychoactive cannabidiol, have also been shown
to attenuate progression of type 1 DM in animal
models.21 22 We have not identified any study in human
subjects or animals examining marijuana or its active
ingredients and the incidence of type 2 DM, although
one study found similar glucose levels in marijuana users
as non-users.8 In a prospective study using a cannabis-
based medicinal extract compared to placebo to treat
diabetic neuropathy, glycaemic indices were not
mentioned.23 We examined physical activity in patients
using marijuana and found that it did not confound the
association between marijuana and DM.
Although the CB1 antagonist, rimonabant has been
used successfully to treat DM,24 we are not surprised

at the association between marijuana use and decreased
prevalence of DM. Marijuana contains a variety of
CBs, of which some, such as cannabidiol and delta9-
tetrahydrocannabivarin, have antagonist properties
that may mediate the anti-inflammatory properties of
marijuana.25
A limitation of our study was its cross-sectional nature.
Despite the efforts of NHANES to enrol a random
representative sample of the US population, persons
attending the study visits may differ from those not
attending in subtle ways that may affect the results of this
study. We are unable to conclude that marijuana use
does not lead to DM nor do we suggest that marijuana
should be a treatment for DM. Although we controlled
for major confounders, it is possible that non-marijuana
users and subjects with DM share some, as yet unknown,
characteristic accounting for the relationship between
DM and non-marijuana use.
An additional limitation is that the marijuana use was
based on self-report and self-report of illicit substances is
often underestimated on self-reports.26 27 Self-report is
subjected to recall bias. However, we expect that recall
bias would be similar in those with DM as those without
DM and would be unlikely to bias our results. Although
current marijuana users were divided into heavy and
light users based on the number of times they reported
using marijuana per month, the amount of marijuana
consumed, route of consumption (inhaled vs oral),
duration of use and time when they quit were not
reported.
A potential limitation was that most patients with DM
were identified by self-report, with a smaller number of
patients identified by having an elevated fasting blood
glucose levels. Because some patients with DM receiving
treatment are euglycaemic, blood glucose levels alone
cannot be used to identify those patients with DM.
However, the percentage of marijuana user was similar in
those patients with DM identified by self-report as that of
those with DM identified by fasting glucose testing.
While we analysed all patients with DM together, we
estimated that over 98% of the patients had type 2 DM,
and therefore, our results are likely to apply only to
patients with type 2 DM. Another limitation is the
possibility of a cohort effect since those who use mari-
juana may have other factors that may predispose
decreased prevalence of diabetes compared to non-users
besides lower BMI.
In conclusion, marijuana use was associated with
a decreased prevalence of DM. Prospective studies in
rodents and humans are needed to determine a poten-
tial causal relationship between cannabinoid receptor
activation and DM. Until those studies are performed,
we do not advocate the use of marijuana in patients at
risk for DM.
