Objective. To examine the prevalence and correlates of vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy among US women of childbearing
age. Methods. Data from 1,814 female participants (20­44 y) in the 2003­2006 NHANES were analyzed to estimate the age-
adjusted prevalence and prevalence ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for vitamin D deficiency (defined as serum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] <12.0 ng/mL) and inadequacy (defined as 25(OH)D: 12.0­<20.0 ng/mL). Results. The age-adjusted
prevalence was 11.1% (95% CI: 8.8­14.0%) for vitamin D deficiency and 25.7% (95% CI: 22.3­29.5%) for vitamin D inadequacy.
Race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white and obesity were associated with increased risks, whereas dietary supplement use,
milk consumption of 1 time/day, and potential sunlight exposure during May-October were associated with decreased risks for
both vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy (P < 0.05). Current smoking and having histories of diabetes and cardiovascular disease
were also associated with an increased risk for vitamin D deficiency (P < 0.05). Conclusions. Among women of childbearing age,
periconceptional intervention programs may focus on multiple risk factors for vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy to ultimately
improve their vitamin D nutrition.
1. Introduction
Vitamin D, a lipid-soluble vitamin or steroid prehormone,
is known to play an important role in bone metabolism
through regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis.
During the past few years, the influence of vitamin D on
nonskeletal biologic processes has been expanded to a wide
array of health outcomes including cardiovascular disease,
insulin resistance and diabetes, cancer, respiratory infection,
innate and adaptive immunity, and both cardiovascular and
all-cause mortality [1­9].
For women of childbearing age, maternal vitamin D mal-
nutrition imposes multiple health impacts on both women
and their offspring [10­12]. Adequate vitamin D concen-
trations during pregnancy help ensure appropriate maternal
and fetal calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism [11,
12]. Consequently, vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy
has been associated with impaired fetal skeletal formation
causing infant rickets and reduced bone mass [13­15]. In
addition, low maternal vitamin D concentrations have been
associated with spontaneous preterm birth and impaired
embryonic and fetal development (including skeletal, brain,
and immunological function development) resulting in
small-for-gestational-age infants [16­18]. Moreover, child-
hood vitamin D deficiency, which is strongly associated with
maternal vitamin D deficiency [19, 20], has been linked to
increased risk for multiple conditions including respiratory
infection [21], asthma [22, 23], type 1 diabetes [24], and
schizophrenia [25]. For maternal health, a low vitamin D
level impairs maternal skeletal preservation and is asso-
ciated with increased risks for osteomalacia, osteoporosis,
miscarriage, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and bacterial
vaginosis [10, 26­28].
Limited evidence has shown that pregnant women and
neonates residing in the northern USA are at high risk
for vitamin D insufficiency regardless the use of vitamin
supplementation [10, 29]. A recent study reported that about
69% of pregnant women and 78% of nonpregnant women
2 ISRN Obstetrics and Gynecology
in the USA had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]
concentrations below 30.0 ng/mL [30]. In those studies, how-
ever, the 25(OH)D cut-point values defined as indicative of
deficiency or insufficiency varied significantly and was lack of
consensus. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recently released
new definitions for vitamin D deficiency (i.e., 25(OH)D
<12 ng/mL (30 nmol/L)) and inadequacy (i.e., 25(OH)D 12­
<20 ng/mL (30­<50 nmol/L))[31]. Thus, by using data from
a large, nationally representative sample of US women, the
present study aimed to (1) examine the prevalence of vitamin
D deficiency and inadequacy among women of childbearing
age based on the new IOM definitions and (2) identify
potential factors including sociodemographics, dietary and
lifestyle-related behaviors, health conditions, and healthcare
utilization that may have predisposed women to increased
risk for vitamin D deficiency or inadequacy. We believe this
information is valuable for women's health care providers
including obstetricians and gynecologists to provide better
counseling for women of childbearing age concerning their
need for vitamin D.
2. Methods
2.1. Study Design. Data for this analysis came from the 2003-
2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), which uses a multistage stratified sampling
design to collect data from the noninstitutionalized civilian
US population on a 2-year cycle basis. Survey participants
were initially interviewed at home and then invited to a
mobile examination center (MEC), where they received vari-
ous examinations and provided blood samples for laboratory
tests. In the NHANES 2003­2006, all procedures involving
human subjects were approved by the Research Ethics Review
Board of the National Center for Health Statistics and written
informed consent was obtained from all participants. Details
about the NHANES survey design and methods are reported
elsewhere [32].
2.2. Participants and Measurements. We examined interview
and laboratory data from female participants aged 20­44
years. The pregnancy status of a woman was determined
as (1) current pregnancy which was confirmed either by
a positive laboratory pregnancy test or by a self-reported
pregnancy at the time of MEC exam, (2) nonpregnant with
a history of pregnancy, and (3) never pregnant. Participants
whose pregnancy status could not be ascertained were
excluded from our analyses.
Participants' serum specimens were frozen and stored at
<­70C until analysis. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D
were measured using the DiaSorin radioimmunoassay proce-
dure (DiaSorin Corporation 25(OH)D 125I RIA kit, DiaSorin
Corporation, Stillwater, MN), which has been described in
detail in the laboratory procedure manuals of the NHANES
website [32]. The 25(OH)D assay has a sensitivity of
1.5 ng/mL; the coefficient of variation ranged from 8.9%
for NHANES 2003-2004 participants to 9.9% for NHANES
2005-2006 participants.
The demographic covariates in our analyses were par-
ticipants' age (20­27 years, 28­34 years, and 35­44 years),
race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Mexican American, and other), and education level (<high
school diploma, high school graduate or equivalent, and
>high school diploma). Major food sources of vitamin
D intake were assessed by asking participants how often
in the previous 30 days they had consumed milk (never,
>0 to <1 time/day, and 1 time/day), or they had eaten
fish (never, >0 to <2 times/week, and 2 times/week).
Potential sunlight exposure was assessed using the 6-month
time period during which they were examined (categorized
as November 1 through April 30 and May 1 through
October 31). Dietary supplement use was assessed by asking
participants whether they had taken any dietary supplements
during the previous month (yes, no). Body mass index
(BMI) for currently pregnant women was calculated from
self-reported, prepregnancy weight and height, and the BMI
for nonpregnant women was calculated from measured
weight and height following standardized protocol and
instruments (<25.0, 25.0­29.9, and 30.0 kg/m2). Smoking
status was categorized as current smokers (participants who
had smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and
were still smoking) and nonsmokers (participants who had
smoked less than 100 cigarettes during their lifetime or
those who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their
lifetime but had stopped). Physical activity was calculated
as an average daily metabolic equivalent task (MET)-hour
index that summed transportation, household, and leisure-
time physical activity, and participants were dichotomized as
having physical activity (MET-hour index >0) and physically
inactive (MET-hour index = 0). Alcohol consumption was
categorized as any alcohol users (participants who had an
average daily drinks of >0 during the past 12 months) and
abstainers (for whom the average daily drink was equal to
0 in the past 12 months). Healthcare access was assessed by
asking participants: (1) whether they were covered by health
insurance or some other kind of health care plan including
those obtained through employment or purchased directly
as well as government programs like Medicare and Medicaid
that provide medical care or help pay medical bills (yes, no),
and (2) whether, during the past 12 months, they had seen a
doctor or other health care professional about their health at
a doctor's office, a clinic, hospital emergency room, at home
or some other place (yes, no).
The medical conditions assessed in the study were hyper-
tension, physician diagnosed diabetes and cardiovascular
disease (including coronary heart disease, angina pectoris,
myocardial infarction, and stroke), and current asthma. The
mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP)
were established by using the average of the last two readings
of SBP or DBP for participants whose blood pressure was
measured three or four times, or using the last reading for
participants whose blood pressure was measured twice, or
using the only reading for participants whose blood pressure
was measured only once. Participants who reported taking
antihypertension medications or who had SBP 140 mmHg
or DBP 90 mmHg were defined as having hypertension
[33]. Physician-diagnosed diabetes or cardiovascular disease

were assessed by asking participants whether they had
ever been told by a healthcare professional that they had
these conditions. Current asthma was assessed by asking
participants whether they had ever been told that they had
asthma and still had it during the survey.
2.3. Statistical Analysis. Of 2,443 female NHANES partic-
ipants aged 20­44 years, we excluded 349 women who
responded "do not know/not sure," refused to answer, or had
missing responses to the question regarding their pregnancy
status. After further excluding those who had missing values
for their 25(OH)D concentrations or other study covariates,
1,814 women remained in our analyses. The estimates for the
mean concentration of serum 25(OH)D and the prevalence
of vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy were weighted and
age-adjusted to the 2000 US female population aged 20­
44 years. We used log-linear regression models with robust
variance estimator to estimate unadjusted and multivariate-
adjusted prevalence ratios with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs). We used a Bonferroni corrected P value for multiple
comparisons and used SUDAAN (Software for the Statistical
Analysis of Correlated Data, Release 9.0, Research Triangle
Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) to account for the
complex sampling design.
3. Results
Of all study participants, 435 were currently pregnant and
1,034 reported having a history of pregnancy. Their mean
age was 32.6 years (95% CI: 32.2­33.1). Approximately
66.8% of women were non-Hispanic white, 12.1% non-
Hispanic black, 10.0% Mexican American, and 11.0% in
other racial/ethnic group. About 14.6% of women had less
than a high school education, 21.2% were high school
graduates or equivalents, and 64.2% attained an educational
level of greater than a high school diploma.
The mean 25(OH)D concentration was 24.1 ng/mL (95%
CI: 23.0­25.1 ng/mL), the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency
was 11.1% (95% CI: 8.8­14.0%), and the prevalence of
vitamin D inadequacy was 25.7% (95% CI: 22.3­29.5%).
These measures did not differ significantly by age (Figure 1).
By race/ethnicity, the mean 25(OH)D concentration was
the highest among non-Hispanic white women and the
lowest among non-Hispanic black women (Bonferroni
corrected P < 0.008, Figure 1(a)). Conversely, the prevalence
of vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy was lowest among
non-Hispanic white women (Figures 1(b) and 1(c)) and the
prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was the highest among
non-Hispanic black women (Figure 1(b)). By educational
level, the mean 25(OH)D concentration increased linearly
4 ISRN Obstetrics and Gynecology
(Figure 1(a)), whereas the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency
and inadequacy decreased linearly (P < 0.001 for linear
trends, Figures 1(b) and 1(c)). By pregnancy status, the mean
25(OH)D concentration was higher among pregnant women
than among those in the other two groups (Bonferroni
corrected P < 0.017, Figure 2); the prevalence of vitamin
D deficiency and inadequacy was lower among pregnant
women than among women with a history of pregnancy
(Bonferroni corrected P < 0.017).
By race/ethnicity, the multivariate-adjusted prevalence
ratio for vitamin D deficiency was 8.3 times as high among
non-Hispanic black women, 4.1 times as high among Mexi-
can American women, and 5.4 times as high among women
in other racial/ethnic groups as among non-Hispanic white
women (P < 0.001 for all, Table 1); the adjusted prevalence
ratio for vitamin D inadequacy was also significantly higher
in these groups (1.8­2.8 times as high as in non-Hispanic
white women, P < 0.001 for all, Table 1). By BMI status,
the adjusted prevalence ratios for vitamin D deficiency and
inadequacy were 1.7 times and 1.9 times as high, respectively,
among women who were obese (BMI  30.0 kg/m2) as
among women with a normal BMI (P < 0.001 for both).
Additionally, the adjusted prevalence ratio for vitamin D
deficiency was 1.5 times as high among women with diabetes,
2.3 times as high among women with cardiovascular disease,
and 1.4 times as high among women who were current
smokers as among their respective counterparts.
In contrast, milk consumption 1 time/day, dietary sup-
plement use, and potential sunlight exposure during May-
October were significantly and independently associated
with lower prevalence ratios of vitamin D deficiency and
inadequacy (P < 0.05 for all, Table 1). Current pregnancy
was marginally associated with a lower prevalence ratio of
vitamin D inadequacy (P = 0.051). Although education
of >high school diploma, physical activity, any alcohol use,
insurance coverage, and having had a health care visit
were all associated with decreased likelihoods of vitamin
D deficiency and inadequacy in unadjusted models, they
were not significant contributors to the full models when
controlling for all study covariates.
4. Discussion
Our study on a large, nationally representative sample
demonstrated that applying the new IOM definitions pre-
dicted a lower prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and
inadequacy than that was reported previously [29, 30].
Our results showed that more than one-third of women
of childbearing age had their vitamin D status below an
optimal level (i.e., 20.0 ng/mL [31]) in the United States.
More importantly, we found that multiple factors were
independently associated with suboptimal levels of vitamin
D among these women.
Significant changes in maternal vitamin D and cal-
cium metabolism occur during pregnancy. For example,
a study has reported that serum concentrations of 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], the active form of
vitamin D, increased by 50­100% from the nonpregnant

state to the second to third trimesters of the pregnancy
[34]. A longitudinal study conducted in Caucasian women
of the United Kingdom showed that plasma 25(OH)D
concentrations were lower among pregnant women than
among nonpregnant controls [35], a finding that may
be largely explained by increased fetal demand for this
essential nutrient which is almost entirely dependent on
vitamin D from the mother [18, 19]. However, results from
other cross-sectional studies have shown, similar to our
findings, that pregnant women have a higher mean 25(OH)D
concentration than nonpregnant women [29, 30, 36]. The
higher 25(OH)D concentrations among pregnant women are
likely due to higher rates of dietary supplement use (i.e.,
83.4% versus 47.3%) and milk consumption of at least 1
time/day (i.e., 63.8% versus 41.4%) among pregnant women
than among nonpregnant women.
Our study showed that multiple factors were associated
with suboptimal vitamin D status in women of childbearing
age. The significant racial/ethnic disparities that we found in
the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/inadequacy were in
agreement with those reported previously both in the general
population as well as in pregnant women, showing non-
Hispanic whites had the highest adjusted mean 25(OH)D
concentration, followed by Mexican Americans, and non-
Hispanic blacks had the lowest [30, 36­38]. Our results fur-
ther demonstrated that, among US women of reproductive
age, those who were non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,
or of other racial/ethnic groups were all at a higher risk, to the
similar magnitude, for vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy
than non-Hispanic white women.
In the human body, about 50­90% of vitamin D comes
from the biosynthesis of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in
the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol that requires sunlight
(ultraviolet radiation), and the remainder comes from

Prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using log-linear regression models without and with adjustment for all other variables listed
in the table; women with serum 25(OH)D 20 ng/mL was used as the referent.
Self-reported prepregnant weight and height were used to calculate body mass index (BMI) for pregnant women, and measured weight and height were
used to calculate BMI for nonpregnant women.
a limited number of foods (mainly fatty fish, eggs, and
liver as well as foods fortified with vitamin D such as
margarine, cereals, and milk products) and from dietary
supplements. A previous study based on data from the
third NHANES (1988­1994) reported that seasonality, milk
consumption, and dietary supplement use were significant
and independent determinants of hypovitaminosis D in
women of childbearing age [39], which is consistent with
the findings of the present study. Fish consumption can be
a major source of vitamin D intake. Lym and Joh recently
reported that frequent fish consumption was associated with
a higher vitamin D level among Korean men [40]. Brock et
al. also reported that a high fish intake was associated with
25(OH)D  25 nmol/L (10 ng/mL) in Finland male smokers
exposed to negligible solar UV light in winter [41]. In the
present study, however, this relationship was not significant
in women of childbearing age. Thus, future research on the
role of fish consumption in improving vitamin D nutrition is
warranted.
Low vitamin D levels are linked to increased risk for
high blood pressure, insulin resistance and diabetes, and
cardiovascular disease in the general population [2, 6­9].
Similarly, among women of childbearing age, we found
that having a history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease
was significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency (but
not vitamin D inadequacy) independent of other factors.
Thus, women with these conditions should be assessed and
counseled for their vitamin D status during their routine
health care visits.
Multiple health-related behavioral factors have been
shown to affect pregnancy outcomes. For example, physical
inactivity in mothers is associated with increased risks for
obesity and obesity-related chronic conditions such as dia-
betes mellitus and hypertension, and pregnant women who
are obese are at increased risk for miscarriage, pregnancy-
induced hypertension and preeclampsia, gestational dia-
betes, and thromboembolism, and at an increased risk of
having children with macrosomia, spontaneous intrauterine
demises, or delivered by Cesarean section which carries
an increased risk for wound infection [42­44]. Maternal
alcohol use and cigarette smoking have been associated
with a higher rate of infertility, spontaneous abortion or
preterm birth, fetal alcohol syndrome (characterized by
growth deficiencies, central nervous system impairment,
behavioral disorders, and impaired intellectual devolvement
with lifelong implication), and facial dysmorphia [45­48].
Thus, maintaining healthy lifestyles is especially important
for women of childbearing age. Previous studies have
consistently reported low serum vitamin D concentrations in
people with a high BMI [38, 49, 50], results consistent with
our finding that BMI of  30.0 kg/m2 was an independent
predictor of vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy among
women of childbearing age. Smoking has been associated
with a low bone mass and an increased risk for osteoporotic
ISRN Obstetrics and Gynecology 7
fracture [51]. Brot et al. further reported that middle-aged
women who were current smokers had significantly reduced
levels of 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D and parathyroid hormone
[52]. Our results also showed that smoking was indepen-
dently associated with vitamin D deficiency in women of
childbearing age. However, we found that other behavioral
factors such as physical activity and alcohol drinking were
not significant determinants of vitamin D status.
Nutritional assessment, education, and counseling are
important components of periconception care. In the present
study, although the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency
and inadequacy decreased linearly across educational levels,
education was not a significant contributor to the models
after controlling for potential confounders. Also, we found
that increasing use of health care services was not a
significant determinant of vitamin D status either. However,
these findings should be viewed with caution because the
effectiveness of nutritional education and counseling was not
assessed in this study.
This study has several limitations. First, the causal
relationships between factors and vitamin D deficiency/
inadequacy cannot be established from our cross-sectional
study design. Second, the drift in serum 25(OH)D measure-
ments over the time has been reported. However, we did not
find significant differences in the prevalence of vitamin D
deficiency and inadequacy between the NHANES 2003-2004
and 2005-2006 survey periods, suggesting that our results
may not have been affected in a meaningful way by the
variability of serum 25(OH)D assay [53].
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that achieving
an optimal vitamin D level remains a distant target for
women of childbearing age in the United States. Given that
adequate vitamin D concentrations in pregnant women are
associated with healthy reproductive outcomes, periconcep-
tional intervention programs may focus on raising vitamin
D levels in these women and efforts to prevent vitamin
D deficiency-linked health outcomes should begin during
routine gynecologic care prior to conception and continue
through the postpartum period. The multiple risk factors for
vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy that we identified in
this study should be useful in identifying at-risk groups of
women who may be targeted by these programs.
