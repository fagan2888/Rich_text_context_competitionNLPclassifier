INTRODUCTION
The concept of hormesis, the stimulatory or adaptive responses to low doses, and
nonlinear dose effects are becoming a more prominent and accepted concepts in
toxicology and risk assessment (Calabrese, 2003). While many have contributed. to
the concepts in hormesis, its recent prominence is largely attributable to the
detailed and extensive assessment of low-dose effects compiled by Ed Calabrese and
Linda Baldwin.
The road to the acceptance of hormesis has been a long and hard one. Most
toxicologists have rejected the concept outright as irrelevant or simply ignored it or
have simply been ignorant of the literature. The discovery that hormetic effects are
evident in over 40% of all studies that meet the criteria for its existence, and that
the effects are seen across toxins and phyla have indicated that low-dose stimulatory
effects need to be seriously considered in toxicology and biology (Calabrese and
Baldwin, 2001).
However, what about clinical medicine? Hormesis is not as prominent a concept in
pharmacology and medicine as the title of this journal would indicate. Why is this? Is
the concept ofhormesis something only ofvalue in toxicology and risk assessment or
are there wider implications? To answer this question I suggest that those interested
in hormesis examine two areas of potential value - one area is new and largely
unexamined, and the second is old and controversial. In examining these areas we
should use research and data as the discerning factors and not make the mistake of
a priori rejection like others have applied to hormesis and that set it back for so long.
The first area is to examine iflow--dose toxins can stimulate reparative processes
such that they can used in the treatment of disease. The second is to examine the

effects of very low and ultralow dose stimulatory effects. Two articles in this issue of
Non-linearity in Biology, Toxicology and Medicine allow us to comment on these areas.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF NONLINEAR EFFECTS
Do nonlinear effects have important clinical implications? Toxins are not always
poisons and drugs are sometimes toxic. For example, there are several hierarchical
dose effects ofaspirin, each with clinical implications. These include the differential
effects of aspirin on serum thromboxane B2, gastric PGE2 output, and gastric
mucosal injury with doses as low as 3 mg/day (Lee, 1994). High-dose aspirin
increases bleeding time, but very low-dose aspirin (0.01 mg/day) shows a decrease
in bleeding time (De Gaetano, 1988; Doutremepuich, 1990). This effect is modu-
lated by vascular wall endothelium factors, probably prostacydin (PGI2) (Lalanne,
1990). Some of these effects have gender differences. For example, bleeding time
and platelet aggregation react differently in males and females at the same dose
(Buchanan, 1983). High-dose and medium dose aspirin are used clinically to inhibit
platelet aggregation, but also can cause bleeding in the stomach and intestines. But
do the hormetic effects oflow-dose aspirin matter clinically? Could low-dose aspirin
increase thrombotic events in men, say after surgery, and be used to prevent gastric
bleeding from higher doses in both genders? More studies on the effects and
mechanisms of low and very low doses of aspirin are needed before we can answer
these questions, but their answers could be breakthroughs in clinical medicine.
Another example of the clinical utility of hormesis is me development of toler-
ance. Cellular and tissue tolerance is a commonly reported phenomenon in allergy
desensitization. Could a similar effect be used in developing cellular tolerance to
environmental toxins? In this issue, we report on the effects oflow and ultralow-dose
exposure of normal prostate cells to low and ultralow doses of cadmium for up to
20 weeks (Jonas, 2003). Expression of metallothionein (MT), the primary Cd
detoxification protein, was induced by exposure to 10-tiMCd for over 20 weeks. Cd
pretreated cells had delayed transformation compared to controls. In addition, the
number oftransformed cell mounds was lower in pretreated cells indicating that low
and ultra-low dose exposure had protective effects to high-dose Cd induced carcino-
genesis. An exaggerated MT response remained even 4 weeks after growth in Cd
free media. Thus, it appears that a prolonged protective window of resistance to
cellular transformation was induced by exposure to low levels of Cd. The potential
clinical utility of this is clear. If the induction of cellular tolerance is a general
phenomenon (like hormesis) it may be a simple and safe mechanism for protection
from a variety of environmental and perhaps even terrorist toxin exposures. This
idea is certainly not any more unlikely than hormesis seemed a decade ago.
HOW LOW DOES BIOLOGY GO?
Do biological systems react to doses even lower than previously thought? One of
the major obstacles to the acceptance of hormesis has been a disbelief that very low

Cliical Utility of Hormesis
doses can and do have effects. Thankfully, this concept is gradually eroding as good
data accumulates showing otherwise. A second major obstacle to the examination
of the clinical utility of hormesis is the association of low-dose treatment with the
controversial medical system called homeopathy. The contaminating use of the
concept of hormesis by homeopathy in an attempt to legitimize itself has caused a
backlash by those interested in the science of hormesis against examining ultralow
doses effects (Calabrese, 2002).
Misuse of the concept of hormesis by unscientific groups should not be the
driving factor in looking at nonlinear dose effects. Those interested in the science
oflow-dose responses should not treat ultralow doses such as traditional pharmacol-
ogy has treated hormesis. Recent reviews of the clinical research on homeopathy
have come to unclear conclusions (jonas, 2003). Before throwing out the bathwater,
let's find the baby first. While hormesis does not prove homeopathy, neither should
a fear ofhomeopathy bias scientists against looking at very low doses. Good scientific
methodology must remain the primary factor in determining truth, not fear of
association.
In our prostate cell model of low and ultralow-dose Cd we found that MT was
not enhanced in doses below 10-6 M. However, mRNA subtype MT-IG was up-
regulated at much lower exposures, and this subtype correlated more closely with
delayed transformation from high-dose Cd than any other factor. In a second
article in this issue, Elzbieta Malarczyk (2003) and colleagues report on t.he
nonlinear effect of low-dose guaiacol and ethanol on the laccase and peroxidase
activities of two strains ofBasidiomycetes, Pleurotussajor-cajuand Trametes versicolor.
Unlike in most studies, they continued to find nonlinear responses in dose ranges
as low as 100-20 mol/L. One of the three reviewers of this article called for outright
rejection. The editors of this journal, however, decided to work closely with the
authors to assure that their methodology was sound. After going through a
meticulous checklist for quality (Table) that was ultimately answered adequately
by the authors, it was decided to accept the article for publication. No doubt some
readers will object to the publication of any research that claims to show effects
below some predetermined level. However, if science is to prevail and if the
potential clinical utility of hormesis is to be explored, we must guard against both
poor methods and a priori conclusions. In all cases, however, research quality
should be the primary judge of value if the clinical utility of hormesis is to be
determined.
We recommend that those doing research on hormesis, nonlinear effects in
biological systems, and the protective or therapeutic effect of low-dose treatments
begin with the quality criteria checklist in the Table of this editorial. We recognize
that these criteria will evolve and change as the field matures. Indeed, other
guidelines for quality research have also been published (Linde and Jonas, 1994;
Jonas, 2001; Calabrese and Baldwin, 2001). We recommend these criteria as a
starting point for investigators and reviewers when investigating the topic of protec-
tive or therapeutic hormesis.
