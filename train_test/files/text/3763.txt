Perception of child maltreatment remains an area of child
maltreatment infrequently examined despite its relevance to
understanding risks of maltreatment of vulnerable children.
Apart from its relationship to childhood maltreatment
(Goldsmith, Freyd, & DePrince, 2009), perception is of par-
ticular interest to understanding maltreatment because of its
relevance to perpetration or propensity to perpetrate mal-
treatment (Madu, Idemudia, & Jegede, 2002; Varia, Abidin,
& Dass, 1996). Yet, knowledge about perception of maltreat-
ment is sparse. Although many factors may be attributed to
this sparse knowledge, including variability in legal and con-
ceptual definitions of maltreatment across regions, prolifera-
tion of terms related to maltreatment, and inconsistent
examination of abusive behaviors across studies (Baker,
2009; Riddle & Aponte, 1999), the majority of existing mea-
sures focus primarily on direct accounts of maltreatment or
retrospective accounts of childhood maltreatment and few on
direct measurement of perception of maltreatment.
Although several measures are used to operationalize cur-
rent or retrospective experience of child maltreatment, those
that measure perception of maltreatment are sparse and pri-
marily framed from perspectives of respondents in devel-
oped societies (Baker, 2009; Curtis, Langworthy, Barnes, &
Crum, 1998; Dunne et al., 2009; Hulme, 2004; Levis, 2012;
Malik & Shah, 2007; Riddle & Aponte, 1999; Walsh,
MacMillan, Trocmé, Jamieson, & Boyle, 2008; Zolotor
et al., 2009). From these measures, some abusive behaviors
peculiar to developing societies are missing. However, mea-
sures operationalized in developed societies may not trans-
late to developing societies because of differences in
sociocultural conditions and experiences. Even within devel-
oped societies, there are indications that perception of mal-
treatment differs across racial, cultural, and ethnic
backgrounds (Ashton, 2010; Shanalingigwa, 2009).
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop and vali-
date an instrument that measures perception of child mal-
treatment in a developing country, Nigeria, where empirical
knowledge about perception of abusive behaviors is sparse.
Perception of Maltreatment in Nigeria
To date, empirical reports suggest that maltreatment such as
physical and sexual abuse, child neglect, and child labors is
prevalent in multiple settings, including homes, institutions,
streets, or places of worship in developing countries
(Akmatov, 2011; Bammeke, 2008; Collings, 1997; King et al.,

Development of Perception of Child
Maltreatment Scale: Reliability and
Validity Analyses
Sunday B. Fakunmoju1 and Funmi O. Bammeke2
Abstract
This article presents reliability and validity analyses of the Perception of Child Maltreatment Scale (PCMS). The scale
comprised 34 items that measure abusive behaviors related to emotional/psychological abuse (10 items), sexual abuse (6
items), child neglect (6 items), child labor (7 items), and physical abuse (5 items). Analysis was based on a convenience
sample of 317 participants in Nigeria. Exploratory factor analysis with promax rotation was used to determine construct
validity of its five-factor structure (subscales). The overall internal consistency of the PCMS was .95; subscales of Emotional/
Psychological Abuse (.93) and Sexual Abuse (.91) were high, whereas those of Child Neglect (.89), Child Labor (.86), and
Physical Abuse (.84) were good. Cutoff scores were computed categorizing scores into low/weak, medium/moderate, and
high/strong perceptions of child maltreatment. Strengths and limitations as well as practical applications and implications of
the scale for research were discussed.

UNICEF, 2010; United Nations, Department of Economic
and SocialAffairs, Population Division, Population Estimates
and Projections Section, 2010), although empirical reports
describing perceptions in the regions, especially in Nigeria,
are sparse. Recent reports in Nigeria, for example, suggest
that respondents perceived activities such as "fetching water,
splitting firewood, sweeping, farming and cooking" as child
labor (Okoye & Tanyi, 2009, p. 1). Though another recent
study suggest that teachers perceived some physically and
verbally abusive behaviors such as slapping, beating students
with hands, kicking, and pushing students as unacceptable,
they also perceived corporal punishment such as flogging of
students with stick or cane as acceptable form of punishment
(Umezinwa & Elendu, 2012). Sexually abusive behaviors,
such as showing pornographic materials to children and fon-
dling of breasts and genital of a child, were perceived as
sexual abuse (Ogunyemi, 2000). Although qualitative details
of abusive experiences and anecdotal reports of perception of
abusive behaviors abound in the region, psychometrically
sound empirical measures of perception of maltreatment
remain sparse.
Existing Measures of Perception of
Child Maltreatment
Some measures have been developed to examine perception
of maltreatment and most are particularly operationalized
through hypothetical vignettes, questionnaires (Likert-type
scales), interviews, focus groups, and scenarios (Bensley et al.,
2004; Portwood, 1999). Some of these measures were devel-
oped to cover perception of major types of maltreatment,
whereas others focus on perception of only one type of mal-
treatment, such as physical or sexual abuse (Ogunyemi,
2000; Robertson, 2007). Yet, validity and reliability of psy-
chometric information is lacking, limiting comparability or
generalizability of findings. Also, most existing measures
reflect abusive experiences in developed societies that may
not cross-validate in developing societies. Nevertheless,
advantages of measuring perception of maltreatment in
developing countries are many, including the possibility of
understanding risks for maltreatment perpetration, child-
hood maltreatment, and generating maltreatment-related
knowledge.
Considerations for Empirical Evidence
After a careful examination of existing measures of percep-
tion of maltreatment, empirical knowledge of abusive behav-
iors remains the next reliable source of materials for
developing perception of maltreatment instruments.
Knowledge about abusive behaviors deemed to constitute
long-term negative consequences for children abounds
(Beltchman et al., 1992; Silverman, Reinherz, & Giaconia,
1996; Springer, Sheridan, Kuo, & Carnes, 2007; Tanaka et al.,
2011), although empirical indicators of abusive behaviors
often differ from social considerations of abuse across
regions. Nevertheless, many abusive behaviors transcend
sociolegal boundaries because of cumulative evidence of
their physical and psychological consequences to children
and because of their contraindications for societal survival.
Because abusive behaviors are best deemed abusive through
empirical demonstration of their long-term negative conse-
quences (McGee, Wolfe, Yuen, Wilson, & Carnochan, 1995),
perception of maltreatment is best operationalized through
abusive behaviors demonstrated to result in long-term nega-
tive consequences to children. Beyond empirical knowledge
of negative consequences of maltreatment for children, fac-
tors such as sociocultural values and beliefs about maltreat-
ment, knowledge of existing regulations regarding
maltreatment (Ashton, 2009), and perhaps childhood experi-
ence of maltreatment are generally believed to influence per-
ception of maltreatment. Thus, integration of these factors
into measures of perception of maltreatment will enhance
validity and reliability of developed measures.
Theoretical/Conceptual Background
Perception of abusive behaviors considered for current scale
rests on constellations of theoretical reasonings including
harm/evidence model (Drake, 1996; Drake & Jonson-Reid,
2000; Drake, Jonson-Reid, Way, & Chung, 2003). According
to the model, behavior (i.e., commission or omission) may be
perceived abusive when characteristics of the behavior are
sufficient to qualify the behavior as maltreatment and when
such characteristics are consistent with existing laws and
regulations describing the behavior as harmful. Thus, the
conception of evidence and harm suggests that social and
legal considerations are given to perception of abusive
behaviors and beliefs and conclusions about abusive behav-
iors are partly influenced by existing laws. As a result of this
conception, the model may be deemed as empirically flexi-
ble to comprehend perception of maltreatment across regions.
For every maltreatment (i.e., emotional/psychological abuse,
sexual abuse, child neglect, child labor, and physical abuse),
evidence or indicator of abuse may be visible or invisible and
may be derived verbally, visually, or empirically from exist-
ing laws or scientific investigation. Similarly, harm or risks
of harm may be physical or psychological and may be
informed by impairment or strong likelihood of impairment
in the functioning of a child.
As a model for describing perception of maltreatment, the
harm/evidence model assumes that conditions for perceiving
behaviors as abusive differ across types of maltreatment
(Drake, 1996). As a result, the criteria of evidence or harm for
perceiving the abusiveness of a type of maltreatment may be
irrelevant for perceiving the abusiveness of another. The
model has been used to examine maltreatment substantiation
decisions (Cross & Casanueva, 2009; Fuller & Nieto, 2009;
Kohl, Jonson-Reid, & Drake, 2009; Trocmé, Knoke, Fallon,
Fakunmoju and Bammeke 3
& MacLaurin, 2009) and legal decisions in contested cases of
maltreatment (Fakunmoju, 2009). Its relevance to cross-cul-
tural understanding of perception of maltreatment cannot be
oversimplified. Therefore, the sociolegal elements that inform
the model imply that knowledge of risk factors and regula-
tions about maltreatment underlie perception of maltreat-
ment, and any scale designed to measure abusive behaviors
across cultures must clearly integrate empirical evidence of
harm (or substantial risks of harm) and sociolegal conditions
related to differential perception of maltreatment.
Method
The study utilized self-report methodology to collect data
from respondents about their perception of maltreatment.
Activities preliminary to collecting data included compre-
hensive review of the literature for questionnaire develop-
ment, evaluation of questions by experts in the United States
and Nigeria, and pilot testing of survey.
Questionnaire Development
The questionnaire was developed based on a comprehensive
review of theoretical and empirical literature on child abuse
and neglect at the local and international levels and informal
exploration of knowledge about maltreatment in Nigeria dur-
ing a 2-year period (Bensley et al., 2004; Dunne et al., 2009;
English, Bangdiwala, & Runyan, 2005; Lalor, 2004a, 2004b;
Pinheiro, 2006; Portwood, 1998, 1999; Riddle & Aponte,
1999). The list of abusive behaviors that were developed and
examined should not be deemed as exhaustive of abusive
experiences of children in the region but rather represent a
broad range of abusive experiences that are frequently (i.e.,
physical, sexual, and emotional/psychological abuse as well
as child neglect) or less frequently (i.e., child labor) exam-
ined empirically. Some abusive behaviors deemed to be
redundant, rare in occurrence, controversial, religiously/cul-
turally sanctioned, too restrictive to local experience, incon-
sistent with international standards, or better amenable to
qualitative approach were rephrased or excluded from the
list. Some behaviors were qualified with specific ages to
ensure conformity with legal definitions and local percep-
tions of a child in the region.
Expert Opinion/Review
After developing preliminary items, experts in child abuse
and neglect in the United States and Nigeria were invited to
critique (online) the items for content and face validity as
well as for relevance, comprehensiveness, and cultural
appropriateness. Experts in the United States had back-
grounds in academic research (i.e., social work) and child
protection practice and experts in Nigeria had backgrounds
in academic research (e.g., sociology, linguistics, history,
and international relations) as well as in nonacademic
professions. In addition to providing a critique of the abusive
behaviors, experts were instructed to determine whether the
identified behaviors may be deemed abusive, whether they
fit the specified type of maltreatment, whether they capture
the range of abusive experiences of children, and whether
they are socially, culturally, and legally relevant. Comments
and suggestions received from the experts were integrated
into revision of the items: some of the suggested items were
integrated into the survey; some items were rephrased for
cultural adaptation and relevance to reflect common cultural
disciplinary practices and abusive behaviors in the region. In
addition to ensuring that items were culturally appropriate,
some items were revised to ensure that they met the stan-
dards of child protection in developed countries to enhance
future comparisons with perceptions of maltreatment in other
regions.
Pilot Test
The questionnaire was pilot tested online via SurveyMonkey.
comTM by 22 graduate students who completed the survey
and provided feedback. In general, feedback suggested that
the items were clear, culturally appropriate, and relevant to
common experiences of maltreatment of children in the tar-
get region.
Abusive Behaviors
The items for analysis include 71 abusive behaviors com-
prising emotional/psychological abuse (16 items), sexual
abuse (17 items), child neglect (14 items), child labor (11
items), and physical abuse (13 items). For each type of mal-
treatment, participants were asked, "Do you think the fol-
lowing is emotional/psychological abuse?" "Do you think
the following is sexual abuse?" "Do you think the following
is child neglect" "Do you think the following is child labor?"
and Do you think the following is physical abuse?"
Participants rated (online through SurveyMonkey.comTM)
the extent to which they perceived the 71 behaviors to be
abusive, using a Likert-type scale of 4 = yes, 3 = maybe or
sometimes, 2 = don't know, and 1 = no. In addition to respond-
ing to the abusive behaviors, participants also provided their
demographic information.
Sample Characteristics
The survey collected data through SurveyMonkey.com from
a convenience sample of university students (i.e., graduate
and undergraduate) and nonstudents who have access to the
Internet in Lagos State, Nigeria. To reach a broad range of
participants, the link to the survey was forwarded to respon-
dents in other regions of the country and Internet café opera-
tors were consulted to recruit participants who did not have
personal access to the Internet. A total of 376 participants
responded to the survey. Some respondents were only able to
4 SAGE Open
complete the survey after more than one attempt due to
Internet connection problems. As a result, listwise deletion
was applied to the data to avoid duplication of responses.
Only completed surveys were considered for analysis. After
excluding incomplete perception and demographic informa-
tion, 317 cases remained for analysis.
Participants (N = 317) were graduate (n = 100, 31.5%)
and undergraduate (n = 144, 45.4%) students and nonstu-
dents (n = 73, 23%) in urban centers in Lagos State, Nigeria.
The majority were single (n = 278, 88.8%) and male (n =
180, 57.5%), although some reported being married,
divorced, or widowed (n = 35, 11.2%) and female (n = 133,
42.5%), with an overall average age of 25.87 years (SD =
5.99). Four cases were missing in data analysis. Additional
demographic characteristics are reported in Fakunmoju and
Bammeke (2013).
Data Analysis
Descriptive analysis was used to describe the demographic
characteristics of participants. Exploratory factor analysis
(principal-axis factoring) with promax rotation was used for
the extraction of factor structure, loadings, and relevant esti-
mates associated with the abusive behaviors. Varimax rota-
tion and principal components analysis were performed to
determine similarities and possible differences in the factor
structure derived from promax rotation and principal-axis
factoring. Other analyses included computation of means,
standard deviations, descriptive analysis for cutoff points,
bivariate correlations, internal consistency estimates, item-
total correlation technique for item analysis, and indepen-
dent-samples t test to determine gender differences in
responses for the scale. The 71 items considered for analysis
measured specific types of maltreatment based on theoretical
considerations, empirical evidence, and expert judgment.
Exploratory factor analysis followed three processes: (a)
analysis of the 71 items to determine their loadings and clus-
tering around respective factors, (b) examination of loadings
and correlations to determine their meeting necessary
requirements for replication, and (c) removal of problematic
items and reanalysis of selected items. Rationale for present-
ing exploratory factor analysis rather than principal compo-
nents analysis was discussed. Presentations of findings
follow recommendations by Neill (2008), as well as presen-
tations by Malik and Shah (2007). SPSS 19® (IBM Corp,
2010) was used for the analysis, and principal-axis factoring
option with promax rotation was the extraction method used
for the final analysis.
Results
Data Screening
Data entry errors were avoided because data were exported
from Surveymonkey.com, although this does not preclude
response errors by respondents. Listwise deletion was
applied to an overall sample of 376 respondents, resulting in
a sample of 317 respondents, which is well above the recom-
mended sample size of 200 (MacCallum, Widaman, Zhang,
& Hong, 1999; see also MacCallum, Widaman, Preacher, &
Hong, 2001) or 300 (Burton & Mazerolle, 2011a, 2011b;
Comrey & Lee, 1992) for conducting exploratory factor
analysis. A sample size of 317 for the final 34 items resulted
in a ratio of approximately 9.06 cases per variable.
Preliminary Analysis
A preliminary exploratory factor analysis of the 71 items1
was conducted. The analysis was specified to extract five
factors (i.e., five types of maltreatment) based on theoretical
considerations, empirical evidence, and expert judgment that
informed the development of the items and collection of
data. Although all items clustered under respective types of
maltreatment (explaining 67.69% of the variance), an exami-
nation of correlation matrix suggests that many items corre-
lated greater than .70 on multiple items, suggesting that "the
items are contributing something unique to the construct, and
therefore, . . . are not unidimensional" (Burton & Mazerolle,
2011a, p. 30). As a result, identified factors may not be repli-
cable or overidentification of factors might occur when
extraction of fixed number of factors is not specified.
Moreover, the retaining of the 71 items might lead to respon-
dent burden. To address these problems, decisions were
made to eliminate items that correlated highly with each
other. Criteria for selecting items for further analysis included
the fact that the items must correlate "at least .30 with at least
one other item" (Neill, 2008, p. 6) and that the items not cor-
relate .70 and above on two or more items (Burton &
Mazerolle, 2011a). As a result, 37 items were eliminated,
leaving a total of 34 items for further analysis.
Table 1 reports means and standard deviations of the 34
items and Table 2 reports the correlation matrix. As shown in
Table 2, correlations between items were significant at p <
.01 and p < .05. Correlations oscillated between low and
moderate. All items correlated at least .30 with at least one
other item and no item correlated .70 and above on two or
more items. For example, only three items correlated highly
with each other: Item 11 (fondling the breasts of a child for
sexual pleasure) correlated highly (.76) with Item 13 (asking
a child to perform oral sex on adults), Item 14 (having sex in
the presence of a child) correlated highly (.76) with Item 15
(engaging in mutual sexual stimulation with a child for sex-
ual pleasure), and Item 30 (inflicting injury or physical pains
on child from punching, kicking, or pushing) correlated
highly (.75) with Item 31 (strangling or choking a child so
tight that the child could not breathe).
Item Analysis
Table 3 reports the item-total correlation (i.e., correlations of
each item with total score of the Perception of Child
Maltreatment Scale [PCMS]) of the 34 items. The table
Fakunmoju and Bammeke 5
indicates that the items significantly correlated with the total
score of the PCMS (p < .0001), suggesting some meaningful
relationships between the items and the overall PCMS. The
overall correlation was between .46 (Item 29: forcing a
7-year-old child to perform excessive and tedious household
chores almost daily) and .75 (Item 8: locking a child younger
than 11 years old alone in a room for a whole day as a form
of discipline).

Factor Analysis
Principal-axis factoring was used to examine the construct
validity of the PCMS because of the need to specify the fac-
tors that are theoretically related to the abusive behaviors
examined. Based on theoretical considerations, empirical
evidence, and expert judgment, a five-factor solution of the
34 items using promax rotation method was specified. The
34 items clustered into five factors that represent the respec-
tive types of maltreatment: emotional/psychological abuse
(10 items), sexual abuse (6 items), child neglect (6 items),
child labor (7 items), and physical abuse (5 items). All items
correlated with each other and Bartlett's test of sphericity
was significant, 2(561, N = 317) = 7,307.93, p < .0005, sug-
gesting that the correlation matrix was not an identity matrix
or that the items were related with each other. Measures of
sampling adequacy (Kaiser­Meyer­Olkin [KMO] = .93)
was well above the recommended value of .6, confirming the
adequacy of sample size for the analysis. Most communali-
ties were very high (as high as .736 for Item 11: fondling the
breasts of a child for sexual pleasure), with the lowest com-
munality being .384 (Item 33: beating a 5-year-old child with
a belt or stick or other objects), indicating that the items
shared some common variance (Table 4).
Initial eigenvalues suggested that the five factors (Factor 1,
emotional/psychological abuse; Factor 2, sexual abuse;
Factor 3, child neglect; Factor 4, child labor; and Factor 5,
physical abuse) explained 40.25% (Factor 1), 8.41% (Factor
2), 5.85% (Factor 3), 5.02% (Factor 4), and 4.10% (Factor
5) of the variance (Table 4). The five-factor solution, which
altogether explained 63.63% of the variance in the overall
scale, was specified because the factors represented the
types of maltreatment that the items were theoretically pre-
determined to support, based on empirical evidence and
expert judgment. As indicated in the scree plot of the factors
(Figure 1), they corresponded with the point on the scree
plot where the eigenvalues began to level off and they dem-
onstrated the point from which considerations of additional
factors were theoretically meaningless. For example, from
the extraction method based on eigenvalues greater than 1,
the sixth factor contained primary loadings on two items
(Item 26: forcing a child younger than 11 years old to take
care of parents/guardians or siblings almost daily; and Item
29: forcing a 7-year-old child to perform excessive and
tedious household chores almost daily), which are theoreti-
cally insufficient to constitute a meaningful, independent
factor and lack empirical bases to be differentiated from the
fourth factor (i.e., child labor).
Table 4 reports the factor loading matrix of the final solu-
tion for the PCMS. The criteria for selecting an item were
that the item must load on the primary factor .40 or greater
(Matsunaga, 2010) and that the loading on a secondary fac-
tor, if any, must be reasonably less than the loading on a pri-
mary factor. (Factor loadings less than .30 were suppressed
in the analysis.) An item that loaded .40 or greater on a sec-
ondary factor was regarded as a complex variable. As indi-
cated in Table 4, all items loaded on their respective factors.
Most loadings were very strong and as high as .893
(Factor 1, Item 1: belittling a child habitually). The lowest
loading was .444 (Factor 4, Item 29: forcing a 7-year-old
child to perform excessive and tedious household chores
almost daily). There was no indication of double loading or
complex variables.
Principal-axis factoring was chosen for this analysis over
principal components analysis because respective items clus-
tered around the specific types of maltreatment that they
were theoretically predetermined to support and because
both analyses produced the same pattern of loadings.
Similarly, varimax (orthogonal) and promax (oblique) rota-
tion methods were examined and both rotation

methods produced similar solutions, although three items
with loadings less than .40 (Items 9, 20, and 25) and one
complex variable (Item 27) cross-loaded between primary
and secondary factors under varimax rotation. Almost all of
the secondary loadings (Factors 2-5) occurred on Factor 1
(emotional/psychological abuse), thus validating the co-
occurrence nature of maltreatment (Clemmons, DiLillo,
Martinez, DeGue, & Jeffcott, 2003; Finkelhor, Ormrod, &
Turner, 2007; Jonson-Reid, Drake, Chung, & Way, 2003;
Malik & Shah, 2007) and the theoretical and empirical com-
plexity of real and perceived impacts of different types of
maltreatment on the emotional/psychological well-being of
children (Goldsmith et al., 2009). However, the discrepancy
between primary and secondary loadings was significantly
large or larger, in half of the items, than the loadings in sec-
ondary factors (i.e., the loadings on the primary factors dou-
bled or almost doubled the loadings on the secondary factors
in most of the cases). Thus, most loadings with promax and

varimax rotation met even the most conservative require-
ments of .60 or .70 for retaining items, as well as the "pri-
mary-secondary discrepancy" rule of .3 to.4 for retaining
items that cross-loaded on secondary factors (Matsunaga,
2010, p. 101).
Regarding the analysis presented in Table 4, promax rota-
tion was preferred to varimax rotation because of its simplic-
ity and efficiency in accomplishing a simple structure and
because of its ability to allow factors to remain correlated
(Abdi, 2003; Burton & Mazerolle, 2011a; Costello &
Osborne, 2005; Matsunaga, 2010). Given the small differ-
ence in loadings between the two rotation methods and
between analysis based on fixed number of factors extracted
(5) and the extraction method based on eigenvalues greater
than 1, the five-factor solution with promax rotation was
retained for final presentation.
Correlation Matrix and Internal Consistency
Estimates
Means, standard deviations, correlation matrices, and alpha
reliabilities that further establish the construct validity of the
PCMS are presented in Table 5. The correlations between
PCMS and emotional/psychological abuse (Factor 1), sexual
abuse (Factor 2), child neglect (Factor 3), child labor (Factor
4), and physical abuse (Factor 5) were .90 (p < .01), .66 (p <
.01), .81 (p < .01), .84 (p < .01), and .68 (p < .01), respec-
tively. The subscales (the five factors) also correlated with
each other significantly: emotional/psychological abuse and
sexual abuse r = .55 (p < .01), emotional/psychological abuse
and child neglect r = .63 (p < .01), emotional/psychological
abuse and child labor r = .70 (p < .01), and emotional/psy-
chological abuse and physical abuse r = .51 (p < .01). Other
significant correlations included sexual abuse and child
neglect r = .39 (p < .01), sexual abuse and child labor r = .50
(p < .01), and sexual abuse and physical abuse r = .30 (p <
.01). Child neglect and child labor r = .62 (p < .01), child
neglect and physical abuse r = .48 (p < .01) as well as child
labor and physical abuse r = .42 (p < .01) also significantly
correlated with each other.
As indicated by Cronbach's alpha, the PCMS and sub-
scales are internally consistent. The alpha coefficient for the
PCMS was .95 and for the subscales were .93 (Emotional/
Psychological Abuse), .91 (Sexual Abuse), .89 (Child
Neglect), .86 (Child Labor), and .84 (Physical Abuse).
Table 6 demonstrates that gender differences did not
influence scores on the PCMS, as the mean scores and stan-
dard deviations for females (M = 121.77, SD = 19.83) did not
differ significantly from the mean scores and standard devia-
tions for males (M = 118.84, SD = 21.10), t = 1.25, df = 311,
p = ns.
Cutoff Scores
The total score on the PCMS was the summation of all
items on the scale and the total score of the subscales was

10 SAGE Open
the summation of individual items that comprised the sub-
scale. The score range on the PCMS was 34 to 136. Levels
of perception of child maltreatment (i.e., high/strong,
medium/moderate, and low/weak) were determined through
analysis of percentile scores and the "criterion of one stan-
dard deviation above and below the mean of the distribu-
tion" (Malik & Shah, 2007, p. 174). The scores on the 25th,
50th, and 75th percentile ranks were 115, 127, and 134,
respectively. The mean score was 120.19 (SD = 20.51).
Examination of frequency distributions suggested that
approximately 46% of respondents scored 126, while
approximately 75% scored 134, indicating the upper range
of perception of child maltreatment (Anastasi & Urbina,
1997, as cited in Malik & Shah, 2007). Thus, a score of 126
and below, between 127 and 133, and 134 and above were
interpreted as low/weak, medium/moderate, and high/
strong perception of child maltreatment, respectively.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to utilize empirical evidence in
Nigeria to develop a reliable, valid, and internally consistent
scale that measures perception of child maltreatment. From a
pool of items generated empirically and through consulta-
tions locally, 34 items emerged from correlation analysis.
Exploratory factor analysis with promax rotation was per-
formed on the 34 items to determine their loadings on the
five factors that were theoretically predetermined to support
emotional/psychological abuse, sexual abuse, child neglect,
child labor, and physical abuse, collectively labeled percep-
tion of child maltreatment. Thus, the present analysis consti-
tutes the initial step in developing and examining the
psychometric properties of the PCMS beyond face and con-
tent validity.
The initial attempt to collect data online was aimed at
reaching the population of literate young and middle-aged
adults whose responses might provide a clear understanding
of current perception of child maltreatment in Nigeria. This
was done for the purpose of providing background data with
which responses of an older and perhaps less literate popula-
tion in the region might later be compared, as well as for the
purpose of providing background data that might facilitate
future comparisons with perception of child maltreatment in
other regions.
Evidence supporting the construct validity of the PCMS
was established through several indices. Item analysis using
the technique of item-total correlation suggests that the indi-
vidual items are related to the overall PCMS. Independent
loadings of items on respective constructs (subscales) that
comprise the scale suggest that the items are related to the
constructs that they were theoretically predetermined to sup-
port. This was further supported by significant correlations
between the PCMS and its subscales: the correlations were
moderate for sexual abuse and physical abuse and high for
emotional/psychological abuse, child neglect, and child
labor. The coefficient of reliability, Cronbach's alpha
(Cronbach, 1984), suggests that both the overall scale and all
subscales are internally consistent. The internal consistency
of the scale and the subscales of Emotional/Psychological
and Sexual Abuse are excellent and that of Child Neglect,

Child Labor, and Physical Abuse are good. As indicated by
the analysis, scores on PCMS did not differ by gender.
Through analysis of percentile scores and the "criterion of
one standard deviation above and below the mean of the dis-
tribution" (Malik & Shah, 2007, p. 174), scores on the PCMS
were categorized into high/strong, medium/moderate, and
low/weak for future considerations.
Although perception of child maltreatment has been
examined in Likert-type and non-Likert-type questionnaires
and vignettes, PCMS adopts the Likert-type questionnaire
format to provide opportunity for future validity and reli-
ability analysis. Standardization of abusive behaviors across
types of maltreatment makes it possible to understand per-
ceptions psychometrically, compare perceptions between
and across regions, precisely measure the impacts of rele-
vant variables on abusive behaviors, track possible changes
in attitudes and beliefs, and determine their effects on
perception.
Strengths and Limitations
This scale facilitates the measurement of perception of child
maltreatment in Nigeria where empirically based instru-
ments are often lacking. As a result of drawing items deemed
to be abusive from local and international sources, the scale
provides the initial step for understanding perception of abu-
sive behaviors in Nigeria and for cross-cultural validation of
abusive behaviors across regions. Thus, the standardized
scale provides opportunity for cross-cultural comparison of
perception and beliefs about child maltreatment and for gen-
erating knowledge that may influence policy, research, and
practice.
Although majority of participants in this study were
young and middle-aged students and nonstudents in urban
centers of a state, samples from rural areas and other
regions, as well as samples of practitioners and profession-
als who work with children such as teachers and social
workers, will provide further validity to this scale. Because
generational differences may influence perception of child
maltreatment, including older populations (as well as
respondents with lower levels of education) in further
studies may provide additional information concerning the
validity of the scale. Although common in many scales, the
absence of negatively worded abusive behaviors may make
the scale susceptible to response set. This concern may be
addressed by inclusion of negatively worded questions in a
scale. Similarly, expansion of response choices from four
response choices to seven response choices also may
enhance measurement precision, quality of data, and mean-
ingful interpretation of results.
Practical Applications and Implications
Understanding perception of maltreatment is vital in many
respects, because perception has implications for reporting
maltreatment, identifying intervention needs of vulnerable
children, formulating and implementing policy, determining
potential for maltreatment, and susceptibility for victimiza-
tion of children. The current scale has some practical appli-
cations and implications for personal, professional, social
services, policy, and research. Similar to other measures of
perception of maltreatment, the PCMS may be useful for
working with parents to determine their disciplinary prac-
tices, their maltreatment values and beliefs, and their suscep-
tibility to perpetration of maltreatment. It also may provide
valuable information about the influence of parenting styles
experienced during childhood on perception of maltreatment
(when combined with appropriate instruments). Because
perception of abusive behaviors is related to acceptance of
maltreatment-related services, PCMS may be relevant to
understanding or predicting clients'responses to intervention
and service.
The PCMS like other measures may be useful for prac-
tice. Because perception of maltreatment is related to out-
comes of assessment of harm or risk of harm, PCMS may be
useful for recruitment purposes to determine maltreatment
perception of practitioners working with children. It also
may be useful for identifying the training needs of practitio-
ners as well as their professional suitability for working with
children and families. It may be useful for policy decision
making as it can help to determine general population norms
and beliefs about maltreatment that may guide policy inter-
vention necessary to protect vulnerable children. For research
purposes, the scale may be utilized to examine the influence
of childhood maltreatment on perception of maltreatment as
well as the influence of perception of maltreatment on pro-
pensity to perpetrate or report maltreatment (when combined
with appropriate instruments). It also may be utilized to
examine the influence of perception of maltreatment on
investigative decisions or outcomes by practitioners in child
protection practice in the region.
Conclusion
Although knowledge about perception of child maltreatment
in developing societies is still in its infancy stage, the absence
of psychometrically sound instruments to measure the percep-
tion remains a challenge in utilizing knowledge about percep-
tion to inform policy, practice, and research. Therefore, the
development of this scale, as well as the preliminary informa-
tion provided through analysis, is a step in the right direction.
