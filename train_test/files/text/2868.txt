Abstract
This paper analyzes the effectiveness of thin-capitalization rules in preventing debt finance
by intercompany loans and explores their consequences for corporate decisions. A theoretical
discussion emphasizes that limitations of the deduction of interest owed to foreign affiliates
would not only affect multinationals' capital structure choice but also investment. An em-
pirical investigation exploits a large firm-level panel dataset of multinationals in order to
analyze the impact of thin-capitalization rules on capital structure choice and investment in
the OECD and some further European countries in the time period between 1996 and 2004.
The results indicate that thin-capitalization rules are effective in curbing tax planning via
intercompany loans. However, investment is found to be adversely affected.

Non-Technical Summary
Tax planning of multinational corporations receives a lot of attention by tax administrati-
on and policy-makers. Multinational corporations seems to have enhanced opportunities to
respond to taxation and capital market conditions with their financing and investment deci-
sions. The adverse revenue consequences and the disadvantage of national companies create
temptations for tax-policy makers to change details in the tax law in order to restrict certain
types of tax planning. However, it is not obvious that an attempt to restrict tax planning
is very effective. Moreover, if it is effective, it is not clear that the corporations' response to
a restriction is generally beneficial for the imposing country. Since, as has been discussed in
the theoretical literature, restricting certain opportunities for tax planning might result in
adverse consequences for the level of investment undertaken by multinationals in high-tax
countries which may also reinforce tax competition.
One important element in multinational corporations' tax-planning is their ability to ad-
just the financial structure not only by means of external debt but also internally by using
intercompany loans. Governments often respond by imposing thin-capitalization rules. A ge-
neral characteristic of these rules is that interest deduction for tax purposes is limited if
the debt-to-equity ratio of an affiliate is above certain threshold. In fact, the imposition of
thin-capitalization rules is widespread among European and OECD countries.
This paper investigates the effects of thin-capitalization rules on multinationals' financing
and investment decisions. A theoretical model derives some basic empirical predictions about
the consequences of imposing thin-capitalization rules for capital structure choice and invest-
ment. The empirical analysis employs a comprehensive micro-level panel database (MiDi)
of virtually all German multinationals' foreign affiliates made available for research by the
Deutsche Bundesbank. Combined with the information about corporate taxation, including
thin-capitalization rules in all OECD and European Union countries over a period of 9 years,
this dataset allows us to study the consequences of the introduction, removal, or change in
thin-capitalization rules across countries and time.
Our empirical results confirm that thin-capitalization rules are quite effective in reducing
tax planning by means of intercompany loans. Moreover, investment is not only found to
be sensitive to local tax rates but is also to a significant degree adversely affected by the
imposition of thin-capitalization rules. Thus, our results confirm that tax policy is facing a
trade-off between limiting multinationals' tax planning and the real consequences of corporate
taxation.

F¨
ur die Steuerplanung stellt die Ausgestaltung der Fremdfinanzierung ein bedeutendes Ele-

reagiert darauf h¨

inzwischen weit verbreitet.

ur die sich anschließende empirische
Analyse wird ein umfangreicher Paneldatensatz (MiDi) genutzt, welcher Firmendaten von
nahezu allen Tochtergesellschaften deutscher Unternehmen enth¨
alt. Dieser Datensatz wird
von der Deutschen Bundesbank f¨
ur Forschungszwecke zug¨

mit detaillierten Informationen zur Unternehmensbesteuerung, insbesondere zu den jeweili-

uber einen Zeitraum von 9 Jahren, versetzt uns dieser Datensatz in die Lage, die Konsequen-
zen der Einf¨

uberpr¨
ufen.
Die empirischen Ergebnisse best¨
atigen, dass steuerliche Beschr¨
ankungen der Fremdfinanzie-
rung die Steuerplanung mittels konzerninterner Darlehensvergaben wirksam beschr¨
anken. Die
empirischen Resultate zeigen jedoch auch, dass Investitionsentscheidungen internationaler
Konzerne nicht nur vom jeweiligen lokalen Steuerniveau, sondern auch vom Grad der steu-
erlichen Beschr¨

Demnach best¨
atigen unsere Ergebnisse die Vermutung, dass die Steuerpolitik letztendlich
eine Abw¨

resultierenden negativen Konsequenzen f¨
ur Investitionsentscheidungen treffen muss.

The Impact of Thin-Capitalization Rules on Multinationals'
Financing and Investment Decisions 
1 Introduction
While all companies will probably respond to taxation and capital market conditions
with their financing and investment decisions, multinational corporations seem to have
enhanced opportunities to do so. This includes well-known strategies of tax deferral
and transfer pricing but extends to many more strategies. Though it is difficult to
assess the revenue losses resulting from multinational corporations' tax planning efforts
for high­tax countries like the US or Germany, tax planning by multinationals seems to
be an important factor (Gravelle, 2004; Desai, 2005). Apart from adverse consequences
for tax revenue, enhanced opportunities to save taxes may give the multinationals an
advantage over companies operating only at a national level. This would distort the
decision to operate multinationally rather than domestically (Bucovetsky and Haufler,
2007). The adverse revenue consequences and the disadvantage of national companies
create temptations for tax-policy makers to change details in the tax law in order to
restrict certain types of multinational tax planning. However, the many dimensions
along which multinational corporations can structure their activities have already led

to rather complex national tax policies with regard to transnational activities (Gresik,
2001). In this situation, it is not obvious that further attempts to restrict certain types
of tax planning are very effective. Even if they are effective, it is not clear that the
corporations' response to a restriction is generally beneficial for the imposing country:
as has been discussed in the theoretical literature, restricting opportunities for tax
planning might result in adverse consequences for multinationals' investment in high-
tax countries and may reinforce tax competition (e.g., Keen, 2001; Janeba and Smart,
2003; Peralta, Wauthy, and van Yperserle, 2006).
One important element in multinational corporations' tax planning is related to the
financial structure. While the taxation of corporate profits generally results in an
incentive to use debt instead of equity, multinationals can adjust the financial structure
not only by means of external debt but also internally by using intercompany loans to
and from foreign affiliates. Facing an increased ability of multinational corporations
to use debt finance, governments often respond by imposing thin-capitalization rules
(Weichenrieder, 1995:165pp., 1996). While these rules differ from country to country, a
general characteristic is that interest deduction is limited if the debt-to-equity ratio of
an affiliate is above a certain threshold. More precisely, interest payments associated
with an excess leverage are generally not deductible from taxable profit. In the US,
for example, corporations whose debt-to-equity ratio is in excess of 1.5:1, and which
pay interest on debt owed to, or guaranteed by, certain non-US affiliates are subject
to the so-called earnings stripping limitation of interest deduction (cf., Sec. 163 (j)
IRC). While the US was one of the first countries that imposed thin-capitalization
2
rules, many countries have followed recently. Figure 1 documents the increased use
of thin-capitalization rules among the OECD and the European Union (EU) countries
over the last decade. In the mid-nineties, less than a third of European countries and
less than half of the OECD countries had thin-capitalization rules in place. In 2005,
three fifths of European and two thirds of OECD countries imposed such rules. In the
time period between 1996 and 2005 in all 39 countries considered in Figure 1, there
were 19 cases where new restrictions on the admissible capital structure were enacted
or where existing limitations were tightened; in only four cases have tax authorities
weakened or entirely removed restrictions.
Despite the spread of thin-capitalization rules, however, empirical evidence on their
consequences is generally lacking. In this paper, therefore, we will investigate the ef-
fects of thin-capitalization rules on multinationals' financing and investment decisions.
A theoretical model derives some basic empirical predictions about the consequences
of imposing thin-capitalization rules for capital structure choice and investment. The
empirical analysis employs a comprehensive micro-level panel database of virtually all
German multinationals' foreign affiliates made available for research by the German
central bank (Deutsche Bundesbank). Combined with the information about corporate
taxation, including thin-capitalization rules in all OECD and European Union coun-
tries over a period of 9 years, this dataset allows us to study the consequences of the
introduction, removal, or change in thin-capitalization rules across countries and time.
The results confirm that thin-capitalization rules are quite effective in reducing tax
planning by means of intercompany loans. Moreover, investment is not only found to

be sensitive to local tax rates but is also to a significant degree adversely affected by the
imposition of thin-capitalization rules. In quantitative terms, the results suggest that
the imposition of these rules is, on average, associated with a decline of investment
by about 4.8%. This supports theoretical concerns that tax competition might be
reinforced if governments restrict cross-border tax planning.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a simple theoretical background
considering the impact of thin-capitalization rules on financing and investment decisions
of a multinational corporation and derives testable empirical predictions. Section 3
discusses the investigation approach. The subsequent sections are concerned with the
empirical analysis. Section 4 gives a short description of the dataset, before Sections
5 and 6 present the results for capital structure choice and investment, respectively.
Section 7 provides the conclusions.
2 Theoretical Implications of Thin-Capitalization Rules
In order to derive the impact of thin-capitalization restrictions on corporate decisions
we will briefly discuss the decision of a multinational company based in country 1 which
carries out activities in the host country 2. Consider the profits related to the stock of
capital invested in country 2
12

) (1 - 2
) (1)
- (i2

+ i1

) - rk2

- µ2
)
5
- c (2
, µ2
) k2
- (µ2
- µ
2
) 2
i1
k2
2
.
Here f (k2
) denotes the output at location 2 where k2
units of capital are employed. 2
is the local tax rate on capital income. The first term in the second line reports the
interest cost, where i2
(i1
) is the rate of interest for debt issued in country 2 (1), and µ2
and 2
denote the share of capital financed with internal and external debt, respectively.
Note that internal debt (µ2
k2
) is remunerated at the interest rate in country 1.1 The
second term in this line captures the return on equity where r is the required rate of
return. If both µ2
and 2
are zero, all capital is financed with equity.2 Before further
considering the profit function, let us briefly discuss the tax incentive for using internal
debt. Suppose that i1
is not different from r. Then, a shift towards debt finance at
location 2 (higher µ2
) will tend to raise profits after taxes, as a larger part of the
earnings of capital is tax deductible. Even in this situation, the corporation will not
finance all capital with debt due to additional cost of debt.3 They are represented in the
1The company might have an incentive to set the interest rates above the market value, but we assume
that the arm's length principle is effective.
2Note that the profit function assumes that the parent incurs external debt in order to finance the inter-
company loan. Thus interest income at the parent is offset with interest cost. The alternative is, of course,
that the parent finances the loan with equity. In this case, however, the parent would have to pay taxes on
the interest income which might be quite substantial if the parent is located in a high-tax country. Our focus
here lies on the first case, since the empirical analysis below is concerned with German multinationals, where
the parent company is indeed located in a high-tax country. The alternative case is discussed by Mintz and
Smart (2004).
3The concept of additional cost of debt has been introduced by the corporate finance literature (for surveys
see, e.g., Myers, 2001; Graham, 2003). Basically, the literature emphasizes that a tax-induced increase in
the leverage is associated with an increase in costs of financial distress (e.g., Kraus and Litzenberger, 1973;
Scott, 1976), or in agency costs of debt reflecting an inability to solve potential conflicts between equity and
debt claimants by means of contracts (e.g. Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Myers, 1977). Another strand of the
literature (e.g., Jensen, 1986; Aghion and Bolton, 1989; Hart, 1988) is concerned with the relationship between
shareholders and management. In this view, debt might be useful to ensure control rights of investors under
6
last line by a convex function of the affiliate's internal and external debt-capital ratios
c (2
, µ2
).4 The last term reflects the imposition of a thin-capitalization rule, which
limits interest deductions up to a fixed share of internal debt, i.e. interest payments for
an excess leverage cannot be deducted from the tax base. Hence, the profit function is
extended to take account of the additional tax payments arising from an excess leverage
above the admissible limit µ
2
. In order to consider cases with and without restrictions
on the tax deduction of interest, we will set 2
= 1 if the affiliate operates under a
binding thin-capitalization rule, i.e. in cases where µ2
> µ2
, and 2
= 0 otherwise.
For internal debt used by the affiliate in country 2 we obtain the first-order condition
r - (1 - 2
) i1
- 2
i1
2
= cµ
(2
, µ2
) . (2)
Accordingly, the leverage related to intercompany loans is determined by the cost of
equity relative to internal debt. If r > (1 - 2
) i1
, the convexity of c implies that
µ2
is positive. In other words, if the after-tax rate of interest is below the required
return on equity, some internal borrowing is inevitable. If 2
equals 1, the marginal
cost of intercompany borrowing jumps up to i1
+ cµ
(2
, µ2
) as the tax deduction is no
longer granted. As a consequence, the amount of internal debt µ2
might be reduced.
However, in the restricted case we have two possible outcomes. If the required return
on equity is sufficiently large (r > i1
+ cµ
(2
, µ2
)), the optimal choice of µ2
obeys
bad conditions, for instance, if a firm goes bankrupt. But since equity allows the manager to control the
corporation under good conditions, a tax-induced increase in the debt-asset ratio relative to the optimal level
would imply an inefficiency which contributes to the additional cost of debt.
4We assume that c (0, 0) = 0, c
(2
, µ2
) > 0, cµ
(2
, µ2
) > 0, and positive second-order differentials.
7
r = i1
+cµ
(2
, µ2
) with µ2
> µ2
. But if the required return on equity is lower such that
(1 - 2
) i1
+ cµ
(2
, µ2
) < r < i1
+ cµ
(2
, µ2
) , we have a corner solution where µ2
= µ2
.
With regard to empirical implications, note that the imposition of thin-capitalization
rules will not only affect the level of intercompany loans; it will also affect its tax-rate
sensitivity. In order to see how, we derive the comparative static effect of an increase
in the tax rate by differentiating the two first-order conditions to obtain
dµ2
d2
=
(1 - 2
) i1
c
- i2
cµ
cµµ
c
- c2
µ
. (3)
Without a thin-capitalization rule (2
= 0) and if interest rates do not differ much,
this term is positive and the strength of the response depends on the interest rate and
on the cost function c (2
, µ2
).5 However, if there is a thin-capitalization rule in place
and it is binding (2
= 1), the positive tax rate effect disappears. In fact, depending
on the degree of substitution between internal and external debt, the effect might even
be negative. Of course, if we have a corner solution such that µ2
is fixed at µ
2
, the
impact of the tax rate is zero.
Beside effects on the capital structure, thin-capitalization rules might also affect the
cost of capital and thus, investment. Consider the first-order condition for the capital
stock
(1 - 2
) fk
(k2
) !
= (1 - 2
) (µ2
i1
+ 2
i2
) + (1 - 2
- µ2
) r + c2
(2
, µ2
) + (µ2
- µ2
) 2
i1
2
. (4)
5It is reasonable to assume that the cross effects are always dominated by the own effects, i.e. cµµ
> |cµ
|
and c
> |cµ
|.
8
Accordingly, the stock of capital is chosen such that the after-tax marginal product on
the left-hand side equals the marginal cost of investment on the right-hand side. The
latter consists of the interest cost (first term), of the cost of equity (second term), and
of the additional cost of debt (third term). The last term, however, adds to the cost
only if a thin-capitalization rule is imposed and binding (µ2
> µ
2
and 2
= 1). Then,
the tax deduction is limited, borrowing is more costly, and the costs of investment are
increased. The consequence will be a lower level of investment. Note, however, that
the adverse effect on investment is increasing in the actual level of internal debt and is
zero at the threshold (µ2
= µ
2
).6
To sum it up, the theoretical discussion offers at least three sets of testable predic-
tions: (i) First of all, the first­order conditions suggest that the amount of internal
debt used by the affiliate is a declining function of the after-tax rate of interest if no
thin-capitalization rule is imposed. Then, a lower interest rate and a higher tax rate
would lead to an increase in internal debt. But, if a thin-capitalization rule is imposed
in the host country and is binding, internal debt received from other affiliates of the
multinational is reduced. If empirical results are supportive, we can say that tax plan-
ning via intercompany loans is effectively reduced by thin-capitalization rules. (ii) A
second implication of the theoretical discussion is that the determination of an affili-
ate's capital structure is different under the restriction of a thin-capitalization rule. If
affiliates are subject to binding restrictions, internal debt is no longer a shelter against
corporate taxation, and thus a higher tax rate will no longer be associated with an in-

be drawn about the tax sensitivity of the capital stock.
9
crease of internal debt. If this is confirmed empirically, binding thin-capitalization rules
would effectively remove the incentive for tax planning via intercompany loans. (iii)
A third implication is related to the stock of capital. While the optimal capital stock
of an affiliate is simply a function of the cost of capital, the imposition of a binding
restriction on internal debt raises the cost of capital. Empirical analysis can test this
prediction and quantify the adverse effect of thin-capitalization rules on investment.
3 Investigation Approach
The empirical analysis below aims at testing the theoretical predictions discussed in
the previous section using a firm-level panel dataset of the affiliates of German multi-
nationals in 36 European and OECD countries. This data, which will be described
in greater detail below, provides information about the capital structure of each affili-
ate including information about intercompany loans. Combined with the information
about corporate taxation, including thin-capitalization rules, this dataset basically pro-
vides us with three sources of empirical variation that can be used to study the effects
of thin-capitalization rules. The first source is the variation in the existence of these
rules in the set of countries over time, which we have noted already in the introduction.
A second source is the variation in the threshold level of intercompany loans above
which interest deduction is denied. A third source, however, stems from information on
intercompany loans received by each individual affiliate. This information enables us
to distinguish between affiliates where interest deduction is likely to be denied because
10
the host-country's thin-capitalization rule is binding, and affiliates where the rule is
most likely not binding as the amount of intercompany loans is below the threshold
level. As we will see below, this third source of variation can be used in particular to
study the differences in the tax sensitivity of capital structure choice.
A natural starting point for the empirical analysis is to consider the effectiveness of the
thin-capitalization rules that have been introduced by several countries. For this pur-
pose, we first apply a simple dummy-variable approach, testing whether the imposition
of such rules has noticeable effects on the capital structure of foreign affiliates in these
countries. More precisely, we run panel regressions of the share of capital financed with
intercompany loans ICLj,k,t
of an affiliate in the host country j held by company k in
period t on a complete set of affiliate- and time-specific effects and an indicator of the
imposition of such rules
ICLj,k,t
= t
+ j,k
+ aRULEj,t
+ uj,k,t
, (5)
where RULEj,t
= 1 if a thin-capitalization rule is imposed in country j in period t
and otherwise zero. If thin-capitalization rules are effective, a should be significantly
negative. Note that the affiliate-specific effects nest country-specific fixed effects, and
thus remove time-invariant differences across countries. Hence, a significant negative
effect would indicate that the introduction of thin-capitalization rules is associated with
a decline of intercompany loans.
In order to check that not only the imposition but also the actual tightness of thin-
11
capitalization rules affects intercompany loans, we employ the alternative approach
ICLj,k,t
= t
+ j,k,
+ aTHRESHj,t
+ uj,k,t
, (6)
where THRESHj,t
is an indicator of the tightness of thin-capitalization rules in country
j as of time t. More precisely, THRESHj,t
reports the admissible amount of internal
debt above which interest deduction will be denied and is expressed as a fraction of
total shareholder capital (inclusive of internal debt). Without any restrictions the
admissible amount is 100%; if there are restrictions, this figure is lower. In the US case,
for example, the limit implied by the earnings-strippings rule would be 60%.7 With
this definition of THRESH, we expect a significantly positive coefficient for a1
.
While the above approach provides some descriptive evidence on the effects of thin-
capitalization rules, it fails to take account of other possible determinants of capital
structure choice such as, for instance, the statutory tax rate. For the purpose of obtain-
ing reliable quantitative estimates of the effects of thin-capitalization rules, we employ
the indicator for the presence or tightness of the rules in an estimation equation for
capital structure choice
ICLj,k,t
= a0
+ a1
THRESHj,t
+ a2
j,t
+ a3
xj,k,t
+ j,k
+ t
+ j,k,t
, (7)
where j,t
is the local profit tax rate and xj,k,t
controls for further characteristics of the
affiliate or the host country which possibly affect the use of debt or the access to credit.
7To see this note that the debt-to-equity limit for internal debt of 1.5:1 implies a maximum amount of
internal debt expressed as a fraction of total shareholder capital of 1.5/ (1.5 + 1) = 0.6.
12
Note that the time effect also captures the lending rate and the taxing conditions at
the parent location, as we consider a set of companies which all share the same parent
location. The affiliate-specific effect captures not only general characteristics of the
affiliate, but also all time-invariant characteristics of the host country. Furthermore,
because each affiliate is associated with a separate fixed effect, the specification nests
company-specific effects. These effects capture company-specific opportunity cost of
capital which might differ, for instance, with personal taxation at the level of the
shareholder.
The estimation strategy presented so far has only tested whether the existence and
tightness of a thin-capitalization rule in a host country are reflected in the amount of
intercompany loans used. In order to test the predictions about the tax sensitivity of the
capital structure, however, we need to explicitly take into account the conditions at the
level of the affiliate and distinguish the decision of restricted from that of unrestricted
affiliates. One way to approach the estimation problem is to follow Hu and Schiantarelli
(1998) and to think of unrestricted and restricted affiliates as operating under two
different regimes: the first regime refers to affiliates where the capital structure is such
that all interest payments for intercompany loans can be deducted from gross profits.
The second regime refers to affiliates where the thin-capitalization rule is binding,
and thus the marginal gain from using intercompany loans is reduced. We therefore
introduce an indicator variable Ij,k,t
taking on the value one if the thin-capitalization
rule is binding for affiliate j of company k in period t, while otherwise zero. For
each regime the financial structure is explained by the same set of variables, however,
13
intercept and slope coefficients may differ.

A basic problem in the estimation of this system of two equations is that selection into
each of the two (sub-)samples is endogenous: the assignment of an affiliate to one of
the samples depends not only on the tightness of the restriction, but also on the level of
internal debt. However, as emphasized by Verbeek and Nijman (1992) and Vella (1998),
fixed effects regressions would yield consistent estimates if sample selection depends on
the individual-specific component, but not on the random component. This would
imply, however, that firms do not switch between regimes.
In order to control explicitly for possible sample-selection effects, we follow Kyriazidou
(1997), who proposes a two-step estimator yielding consistent estimates under more
general conditions. The first step is concerned with the selection process captured by a
binary regression model such as Chamberlain's (1980) fixed effects logit estimator. The
second step is concerned with the estimation of the model in first differences using only
affiliates that are observed in the same regime in both periods. The estimation uses a
weighted least squares procedure, where the parameters of the selection equation are
used to construct kernel weights, such that pairs of observations with larger differences
in the selection effects receive a smaller weight.
14
With regard to the possible determinants of the selection equation, we note first that
sample selection should depend on the determinants of capital structure choice. An-
other rather obvious variable would be the actual admissible internal debt limit as
captured by THRESHj,t
. In addition, a useful predicting variable could be the ratio
of nominal share capital to total capital, because an affiliate with more nominal capital,
ceteris paribus, is expected to be less frequently restricted by the thin-capitalization
rule.
Presuming that the analysis of internal debt supports the theoretical predictions about
how thin-capitalization rules affect internal debt and curb the incentive to engage in
tax planning via intercompany loans, we finally turn to the effects on investment. As
suggested by the first-order condition, the optimal capital stock depends on the various
components of the cost of capital including the statutory tax rate, the return on equity,
as well as on the interest rates weighted with the components of the capital structure.
As the first order condition is concerned with the capital­labor ratio, an analysis of
the optimal stock of capital should further include determinants of employment such
as wages or, in a more general setting, other indicators of costs and profits. The
simple theory above has neglected any form of adjustment costs, which might be quite
substantial at least with regard to real investment. In the presence of adjustment cost,
however, it becomes necessary to at least invoke a simple partial adjustment mechanism
where current investment aims at reducing the gap between optimal and existing stocks
of capital. The empirical analysis, therefore, is concerned with investment as a function
of the lagged stock of capital as well as of the determinants of the optimal stock of
15
capital. Thus, we specify a multivariate estimation equation
 log Kj,k,t
=  log Kj,k,t-1
+ b0
+ b1
THRESHj,t
+ b2
zj,k,t
+ j,k
+ t
+ j,k,t
,
(9)
where t
is a time-specific and j,k
is an affiliate-specific effect. zj,k,t
contains several
controls, which may or may not be company specific. These reflect differences in the
market size, in the local production cost including the corporate tax rate and deprecia-
tion allowances, or in other variables that affect the capital structure choice as captured
above by xj,k,t
.
The estimation equation involves a dynamic specification in a panel-data context. Thus,
one might be concerned about a possible dynamic panel bias (Nickell, 1981), even
though the data covers no less than nine subsequent years. To address this problem,
we will invoke a GMM estimator, exploiting the moment conditions related to lagged
levels of the dependent variable in a first differenced setting as suggested by Anderson
and Hsiao (1982) and Arellano and Bond (1991).
4 Data and Descriptive Statistics
The empirical analysis employs micro-level data for multinationals provided by the Bun-
desbank. This includes a comprehensive annual database of direct investment stocks of
German enterprises held abroad. More precisely, the data provides information about
each foreign affiliate's balance sheet and some further information about the ownership
16
as well as about the German investor. For the purpose of this study we use annual
firm-level panel data for foreign affiliates controlled by a German parent, in the time
period from 1996 to 2004. Data collection is enforced by German law, which determines
reporting mandates for international transactions.8 Since the above theoretical discus-
sion is concerned with a multinational corporation that completely controls the capital
structure of its affiliates, we focus on majority-owned subsidiaries and also exclude in-
directly held investment. Furthermore, because the theoretical model only deals with
productive affiliates, holdings and financial service providers as well as observations
with zero capital and zero sales are excluded.
Table 1 provides some descriptive statistics on the size and geographic distribution of
the foreign affiliates in the sample. The list of host countries comprises 36 countries; 28
of which are European countries. We include in particular all EU and OECD member
states, where a complete set of control variables is available.9 The table reports country-
specific means for the two variables which are the focus of the empirical investigation,
i.e. the share of internal debt and the stock of fixed assets. The share of internal debt
is defined by ratio of internal liabilities to total capital consisting of nominal capital,
capital reserves, profit reserves, and total debt. To study the investment decision we
8Sec. 26 Aussenwirtschaftsgesetz (Law on Foreign Trade and Payments) in connection with Aussen-
wirtschaftsverordnung (Foreign Trade and Payment Regulations). Each German multinational has to report
its foreign assets including both direct FDI and indirect FDI conditional on some lower threshold level for
mandatory reporting. Since 2002, FDI has to be reported if the participation is 10% or more and if the
balance-sheet total of the foreign object exceeds 3 million euros. For details see Lipponer (2006). Though
previous years showed lower threshold levels, we apply this threshold level uniformly for all years in the panel.
9Although Romania is a EU member state, it is not included because lending rates are not available. Iceland
is excluded since no affiliates in the dataset are reported there. Finally, Germany is not included as the parent
companies' country.

focus on the stock of fixed assets.
In order to capture the tax incentives for the capital structure, the analysis employs the
statutory tax rate on corporate income modified by applicable restrictions on interest
deductions, such as in the case of the Italian local business tax (IRAP). Thus, the
employed statutory tax rate captures the tax savings from deducting one unit of interest.
Since the effective tax reduction from using debt might be zero if a subsidiary carries
forward any losses for tax purposes (MacKie-Mason, 1990), we also use a dummy
variable indicating whether some loss carry-forward is reported. Of course, the existence
of losses in the previous periods may capture other characteristics of the current decision
problem of the company, such as the expected performance of a subsidiary. Hence, the
overall effect on the capital structure is ambiguous.
Figure 2 depicts the development of the admissible amount of internal debt expressed
as a fraction of total shareholder capital. Given the differences in the details of thin-
capitalization rules across countries, the admissible amount of internal debt depicted
in Figure 2 generally reflects an upper limit. In several countries, interest deduction
may be denied even if internal debt is lower: external debt might be included if backed
by the parent, and in some countries the limit is even expressed in terms of total
debt rather than internal debt.10 Figure 2 shows that the trend towards imposing
thin-capitalization rules (see Figure 1) is reflected by the value of the threshold level.
However, the mean value for European countries as well as for OECD countries in 2004
10The US case serves as an example, because Sec. 163 (j)(3)(B) IRC explicitly includes external debt backed
by the parent and Sec. 163(j)(2)(C) IRC refers to total debt.

is still above the US figure, where the threshold of the debt-to-equity ratio yields a
limit of the admissible fraction of internal debt of 60%.11
As the firm-level data does not provide us with information about firm-specific inter-
est expenses, we employ the lending rate for the private sector taken from the IMF,
augmented, where possible, with OECD data. In order to control for company-specific
variation in the borrowing conditions, we employ the affiliate's sales as an indicator
of the cash flow of the subsidiary. Another variable that captures differences in bor-
rowing conditions is the asset tangibility measured as the ratio of fixed assets to the
balance-sheet total. Following the financing literature, a higher tangibility of assets
should result in more favorable borrowing conditions because agency costs may be re-
duced by collateral (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). In order to interprete the signs of
the coefficients, it is important to note that we focus on internal debt rather than total
debt. Since internal debt shows a substitutive relationship with external debt (Desai,
Foley, and Hines, 2004), higher external borrowing costs might be positively associated
with internal debt.
With regard to the analysis of investment, we employ some additional controls. Because
investment might not only be affected by the statutory tax rate but also by depreci-
ation allowances, we include a control variable for the present value of depreciation
11In the US case, the application of the earnings-stripping rule additionally requires that the corporation's net
interest expense exceeds 50 percent of the adjusted taxable income of the corporation. Since we do not observe
data on interest expenses, we will not attempt to take this additional requirement into account. However,
for those regressions where we use information about the threshold level, we carried out robustness checks by
excluding US observations and did not detect any qualitative differences to the results presented below.

allowances.12 Further controls include hourly labor cost in manufacturing as available
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In order to capture the market size we have in-
cluded the GDP. Finally, the list of variables is augmented by a corruption perception
index as the prevalence of corruption may deter foreign direct investment (e.g., Wei,
2002). Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for the main variables.
5 The Impact of Thin-Capitalization Rules on Intercompany
Loans
As discussed above, we will first carry out some general tests concerning the effectiveness
of thin-capitalization rules. Column (1) of Table 3 reports results for the dummy-
variable approach. Note that because estimation controls for affiliate level fixed effects,
only variation in the existence of thin-capitalization rules within each country matters.
Thus, the negative significance of the dummy variable, that captures the existence of
a thin-capitalization rule, indicates that introducing such a rule exerts a significant
impact on intercompany loans: the average amount of intercompany loans is reduced
if a thin-capitalization rule is introduced. The magnitude suggests that the share of
internal debt is reduced by 2.6 percentage points. Column (2) provides results where
the simple dummy is replaced by the actual admissible threshold level of internal debt.
The positive coefficient suggests that a tighter limit would actually be associated with
less internal debt.
12Note that due to restrictions of interest deduction, the tax rate used in the analysis of the capital structure
differs slightly from the statutory tax rate used in the analysis of investment.

Firm-level variables are taken from the Bundesbank (MiDi) data. Minimum and maximum values of firm-
level variables are averages of the 3 smallest (largest) values. Corporate taxation data are taken from the
International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation (IBFD), and from tax surveys provided by Ernst&Young, PwC
and KPMG. The lending rate refers to private sector debt taken from the IMF International Financial Statistics
Yearbook (2006) augmented with corresponding OECD figures. GDP in U.S. dollars at current prices is taken
from World Bank World Development Indicators (2006). Labor costs in U.S. dollars for production workers in
manufacturing are taken from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and Eurostat. The Corruption Perception
Index is taken from Transparency International; the score ranges from 10 (country perceived as virtually
corruption free) to 0 (country perceived as almost totally corrupt).

In a further step, we employ a regression approach that includes control variables for
other determinants of capital structure choice. Column (3) shows results of regressions
with a standard set of controls. For all variables, the estimated coefficients show the
expected signs. According to Column (3), an increase in the tax rate by 10 percentage
points results in an increase in the internal debt share by about 2 percentage points.
While this estimate is lower than results in the existing literature,13 it should be noted
13Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004) report an impact of a 10 percentage point increase of the tax rate of 3.3
percentage points for US multinationals. Mintz and Weichenrieder (2005) report results for foreign subsidiaries
24
that this coefficient only relates to internal debt. Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004) have
considered the tax-sensitivity of internal debt with data for US multinationals and ob-
tained a smaller coefficient, suggesting that an increase in the tax rate by 10 percentage
points results in an increase of the internal debt share of 0.8 percentage points. How-
ever, given a lower share of internal debt in the case of US multinationals, the implied
elasticity for the US case is 0.35 as compared to 0.25 in our case.
With regard to the indicators of borrowing cost, the results are in accordance with the
theoretical predictions, given the above-mentioned substitutability between external
and internal debt. Asset tangibility shows a negative effect suggesting that less internal
debt is used if borrowing costs for external debt are reduced. Similarly, the positive
effect of the lending rate indicates that more internal debt is used if borrowing costs
deteriorate.
To test for the effects of thin-capitalization rules, Column (4) includes the dummy
for the existence of a thin-capitalization rule; Column (5) employs the actual level of
the threshold above which interest deduction is denied. Both specifications support
the effectiveness of thin-capitalization rules. However, Column (5) is preferred since it
includes information about the tightness of the rules. In order to illustrate the empirical
magnitude, consider the case of a country which introduces a thin-capitalization rule
with a 1.5:1 ratio of internal debt to equity (i.e, the US case). In this case, the threshold
level of intercompany loans would come down from 1 to a figure of 0.6. According to the
of German corporations of between 3.0 and 5.7 depending on the specification. For German affiliates of foreign
investors, Ramb and Weichenrieder (2005) find a coefficient of 1.4; Huizinga, Laeven, and Nicod`
eme (2006)
find a somewhat lower estimate of 2.7 for a sample of European corporations.
25
point estimate in Column (5), the share of internal debt would drop by 4.6 percentage
points.
While the results support the effectiveness of thin-capitalization rules, an investigation
of the consequences for the tax-rate sensitivity would have to take into account that
the rules are not equally relevant for all subsidiaries. In fact, thin-capitalization rules
are only binding for a subset of subsidiaries. As we know from the above theory, only
for the subsidiaries where the rule is not binding would we expect intercompany loans
to be positively associated with the tax rate. In contrast, internal debt of restricted
subsidiaries should not be positively affected by the tax rate; depending on the degree
of substitutability and on whether or not affiliates are stuck in a corner solution, even
a negative impact might be found.
To see whether, in fact, the tax sensitivity of the capital structure choice differs, we
have to decompose the sample of subsidiaries into sub-samples where the subsidiaries
have intercompany loans below or above the threshold, above which interest can no
longer be deducted from the tax base.
In fact, as depicted in Columns (1) and (2) of Table 4, a significant positive tax-rate
sensitivity of intercompany loans is found only for subsidiaries where the amount of
intercompany loans falls below the threshold defined by the thin-capitalization rule.14
For subsidiaries using more intercompany loans, the tax rate has no significant effect.
14Affiliates are treated as restricted if internal debt as a fraction of total shareholder capital (inclusive of
internal debt) exceeds the accepted threshold for internal debt. Since in the US the limit is expressed in terms
of debt rather than internal debt (Sec. 163(j)(2)(C) IRC), we carried out regressions based on this modified
definition of restricted subsidiaries. However, the results are very similar.

27
As these results are obtained from fixed effects panel regressions, they are consistent
if sample selection is driven by the time-invariant characteristics of the subsidiaries.
Even though it seems rather restrictive to assume that sample selection effects are
fully captured by the fixed effects, according to Columns (3) and (4), similar results
are found if all those subsidiaries are removed that have been switching between the
regimes. This suggests that the results are mainly driven by affiliates where the selection
is time invariant.
In order to obtain consistent estimates in the presence of sample selection effects, we
check for differences in the tax-rate sensitivity between restricted and unrestricted
subsidiaries following Kyriazidou (1997). The results for the corresponding first-step
estimation of the probability of a binding restriction as presented in Column (1) of
Table 5 are clearly in line with the theoretical predictions.15 A higher tax rate and
a lower loss carry-forward provide an incentive for the affiliate to use more debt such
that it is more likely to pass the threshold. Given the substitutability between internal
and external debt, the positive significance of the local lending rate and of sales as
well as the negative effect of tangibility are also in accordance with theoretical expec-
tations. A significant adverse effect of the tightness of restrictions on the likelihood of
being above the threshold is supported, and with regard to nominal capital, the estima-
tion shows a negative effect. The former reflects the effectiveness of thin-capitalization
rules for capital structure choice. The latter seems reasonable, because an increase in
nominal capital makes it less likely that the thin-capitalization rule is binding. The
15Note that the fixed effects logit estimator removes all observations where no change in the regime is
observed. This explains why the number of observations is relatively small.

results for the second-step estimation are reported in Columns (2) and (3). Column
(2) shows the determinants of intercompany loans in the sub-sample of firms where a
thin-capitalization rule is not binding; Column (3) is concerned with the group where
a thin-capitalization rule is binding. Basically, the results confirm our findings from
Table 4. For the unrestricted subsidiaries, asset tangibility and the existence of a loss
carry-forward show the expected effects and the statutory tax rate shows a signifi-
cantly positive effect. For the restricted firms, the coefficients for asset tangibility and
the existence of a loss carry-forward show the same signs, but only the latter proves
significant. Moreover, the coefficient for the statutory tax rate is negative, albeit in-
significantly. The difference in the effects of the tax rate supports the view that binding
thin-capitalization rules would effectively remove the tax incentive for tax planning via
intercompany loans.
6 The Impact of Thin-Capitalization Rules on Investment
Let us finally consider the consequences for investment. Because no information about
actual purchases of capital or about depreciation is given in the data, we have to rely
on the balance-sheet information for each individual affiliate's stock of fixed assets.
As a dependent variable we compute the change in the stock of fixed assets (in logs)
with regard to the previous period. Table 6 provides the respective regression results.
Columns (1) and (2) report results from regressions without controlling for a par-
tial adjustment process. While Column (1) employs the binary indicator of whether a

thin-capitalization rule exists or not, Column (2) utilizes the threshold level for internal
debt instead. Both estimations account for affiliate- as well as time-specific fixed effects.
Nevertheless, both regressions report significant effects of thin-capitalization rules. Col-
umn (1) indicates that the introduction of a thin-capitalization rule is accompanied with
lower investment, whereas Column (2) indicates that tighter thin-capitalization rules
exert an adverse effect on investment.
Columns (3) and (4) report results including the lag of the stock of fixed assets (in
logs). Even though the lagged stock of capital is significant, the results on the control
variables are not much different, qualitatively. However, a problem with the dynamic
specification in Columns (3) and (4) is that it ignores a possible dynamic panel bias.
Therefore, Columns (5) and (6) report results from a consistent dynamic panel data
estimation procedure as suggested by Arellano and Bond (1991).16 Because test sta-
tistics for overidentifying restrictions and autocorrelation do not point at specification
errors, and because the lagged stock of fixed assets shows a different coefficient, these
instrumental variable specifications are preferred.
Again, we find significant effects for both the existence of thin-capitalization rules and
their tightness. Moreover, in accordance with theoretical predictions, a lower statutory
tax rate is associated with a higher level of investment.17 With regard to the further
16Given a time period of nine years available for the analysis, we employ a parsimonious GMM specification
exploiting only the additional moment conditions with the level of the capital stock two periods ago.
17While the statutory tax rate was adjusted in order to take account of special provisions for debt finance
(see above), for the purpose of studying investment, both the basic statutory tax as well as the adjusted tax
rate would matter. However, probably due to the rather small differences between the two tax rates, various
alternative specification showed no significant differences.
32
control variables, we should note that estimations control for affiliate-specific fixed ef-
fects which nest country-level fixed effects, and thus entirely remove cross-sectional
variation across countries. This might explain why, for instance, labor cost proves
insignificant. The lending rate shows a positive effect which potentially picks up infla-
tion. Sales shows a strong positive coefficient pointing at positive market-size effects.
The negative impact of the loss carry-forward might simply reflect unfavorable profit
prospects. Both regressions point to a significant adverse effect of thin-capitalization
rules: firm-level investment is lower if a thin-capitalization rule is introduced or if these
rules are tightened.
With regard to the implied magnitudes, we note first that according to Column (5)
the introduction of a thin-capitalization rule is associated with a decline in investment
by about 5 percentage points. To illustrate the effect of the tightness of restrictions
in Column (6) consider, once again, the case of a thin-capitalization rule with a debt-
equity threshold of 1.5:1. If such a rule were to be repealed, the THRESH variable
would jump from a level of 0.6 to unity. According to the point estimate in Column
(6), investment would increase by 8.72 percent.18 However, considering that the mean
limit in the dataset is 0.782, the removal of restrictions would exert a positive impact
on investment of 4.8 percent on average.
18If we took the coefficient of the lagged stock of capital as a measure of the adjustment speed, we could
derive a point estimate of 24.7% for the long-term effect on the stock of capital.

7 Conclusions
In the last decade, governments in Europe and in other OECD countries have increas-
ingly restricted debt finance of multinationals by means of thin-capitalization rules.
These rules typically limit interest deduction if the debt-capital ratio related to share-
holders is above a certain threshold. While the motivation of this measure of tax policy
is to curb tax planning of multinationals by means of intercompany loans to and from
foreign affiliates, effectiveness and consequences have not been analyzed, so far. Using
a micro-level panel dataset of German multinationals, this paper studies both the ef-
fectiveness of the limitations as well as their impact on corporate decisions with regard
to capital structure choice and investment.
A theoretical discussion suggests that binding thin-capitalization restrictions would not
only result in a reduction of internal debt but also in a lower tax sensitivity of internal
debt. At the same time, binding restrictions should exert adverse effects on capital cost
and, hence, reduce investment.
The empirical investigation is concerned with capital structure choice and investment
of the subsidiaries of German multinationals in 36 countries in the time period between
1996 and 2004. An analysis of the capital structure shows that more internal debt is
used in host countries with high tax rates and where the borrowing cost of external
debt are high. The analysis also confirms that imposition and tightening of thin-
capitalization rules is, in fact, associated with a significant reduction in the use of
internal debt.
34
In a second step of the analysis, we compare the internal debt-to-capital ratio of the
individual affiliate with the restrictions in the respective host country. This allows
us to distinguish affiliates which are most likely subject to binding thin-capitalization
restrictions from the others. A fixed effects panel regression for subsidiaries shows that
a significant tax sensitivity of internal debt is only found for those affiliates that do
not face binding restrictions. This result is further confirmed in a panel data sample
selection model. It indicates that thin-capitalization restrictions effectively remove the
incentive for tax planning by means of intercompany loans.
In a third step of the analysis, we consider investment in the subsidiaries' stock of
capital. While the analysis confirms an adverse effect of the local tax rate, invest-
ment is shown to be adversely affected by the imposition of a thin-capitalization rule.
This result is confirmed in regressions where investment is assumed to follow a partial
adjustment process towards an optimal capital stock. The point estimate for the ad-
verse impact of thin-capitalization rules on investment suggests that repealing a strict
1.5:1 debt-equity ratio would result in an increase of investment by about 8.72 percent.
Given that most countries have less restrictive rules, the average impact of the removal
of restrictions on investment is estimated to be 4.8 percent.
Thus, our results confirm that tax policy is facing a trade-off between limiting multi-
nationals' tax planning and the real consequences of corporate taxation. This suggests
that tax policy should take account of the adverse investment effects of restrictions on
tax planning by means of debt finance. Imposing restrictions alone does not enable tax
policy to escape the fundamental questions concerning the corporation tax raised by
35
the emergence of multinationals.
Datasources and Definitions
Firm-level data are taken from the micro-level dataset (MiDi) of the Deutsche Bun-
desbank. (See Lipponer (2006) for an overview.) The share of internal debt is
determined by the level of balance-sheet internal liabilities divided by total capi-
tal consisting of nominal capital, capital reserves, profit reserves, and total debt.
Investment is defined as the logarithmic difference in the balance-sheet position of
fixed assets. Asset tangibility is defined as the ratio of fixed assets to balance-sheet
total.
Corporate taxation data are taken from the International Bureau of Fiscal Doc-
umentation (IBFD) and from tax surveys provided by Ernst&Young, Pricewa-
terhouseCoopers (PwC), and KPMG. The statutory tax rate variable contains
statutory profit tax rates modified by applicable restrictions on interest deduc-
tions.
Thin-Capitalization rules: Basic information about thin-capitalization rules is ob-
tained from the same sources as the tax data. This information was augmented
and cross-checked with questionnaires sent out to country experts of Pricewater-
houseCoopers.
Present values of depreciation are calculated for investments in machinery, assum-
ing a discount rate of 7.1 percent. Depreciation rules are taken from the references
considered in case of corporate taxation data (see above).
Lending rates refer to private sector debt taken from the IMF International Financial
Statistics Yearbook (2006) augmented with corresponding OECD figures.
