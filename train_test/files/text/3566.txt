Introduction
Obesity is characterised as a condition in which adiposity
is abnormally high, which represents a substantial health
risk.1 This increase in fat mass has also been related to the
sub-chronic inflammation state of obesity, favouring the
development of several diseases, such as type 2 diabetes,
hypertension, dyslipidaemias, non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease and metabolic syndrome (MS).2
It is well known that childhood obesity is a well-
recognised risk factor for developing MS in adulthood.3

Abstract
Introduction: The main purpose of the present study was to investigate whether I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene
might affect metabolic changes related to the metabolic syndrome through a long-term interdisciplinary therapy in obese
adolescents.
Methods: In total, 125 obese adolescents who entered the interdisciplinary obesity programme were assigned to the
following two subgroups: metabolic syndrome or non-metabolic syndrome. They were evaluated at baseline and after 1
year. Genomic DNA was extracted from circulating leukocytes.
Results: Subjects with the II genotype in the non-metabolic syndrome group were only to increase their fat-free
mass after therapy. Regarding lipid profile, subjects with ID and DD genotypes from both groups reduced their low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels significantly. The metabolic parameters from the ID and DD genotypes of the non-
metabolic syndrome group showed a significantly improved insulin response.
Conclusion: In the present study, we showed that the ACE polymorphism was able to influence the fat-free mass in
the I-carry allele in the non-metabolic syndrome group positively. In addition, the I-carry allele was able to improve the
insulin resistance of the metabolic syndrome group significantly. These results suggest that the ACE I/D genotypes can
influence, in different ways, the specific parameters of metabolism among obese adolescents submitted for long-term
interdisciplinary therapy.

MS has a complex pathogenesis in which interactions are
involved between certain environmental factors, the lack
of physical activity, stress and high-fat food. However, in
the last few years, genome-wide association studies have
identified numerous candidate polymorphisms that are
unequivocally associated with metabolic-related traits,
including obesity, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidae-
mia.4 These studies have shown a range of 10­30% of par-
ticipation in the heritability of MS.5­8
Among the candidate genes related to metabolic path-
ways, the genes for the B2 and B3-adrenergic receptors,
lipoprotein lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase, peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-, insulin receptor substrate-1
(IRS1) and glycogen synthase,4,9 among others,10,11 are
involved in the development of MS.
Several studies have recently concentrated on genetic
variants in the renin­angiotensin system (RAS) in associa-
tion with the components of MS. The RAS plays an essen-
tial role in the regulation of blood pressure levels and renal
homeostasis, and it is involved in clinical alterations in
organ damage through the variation of gene expression as
well as growth, fibrosis and inflammatory response.12­14
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is recognised
as one of the main effector enzymes of this system; ACE
(EC 3.4.15.1) is a zinc metallopeptidase that converts the
inactive decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I) to the potent
vasopressor angiotensin II (Ang II) in the RAS and inacti-
vates the vasodilator bradykinin in the kallikrein­kinin
system (KKS).15,16 The KKS is involved in glycaemic
metabolism mainly via B2 receptor activation, which is
able to mediate glucose uptake and improve insulin sensi-
tivity. Thus the ACE enzyme concentration and activity
could regulate the energetic homeostasis through modula-
tion of this system.17
The ACE gene is localised on the long arm of chromo-
some 17 (17q23) and contains 26 exons. The gene is
known to contain polymorphisms consisting of an inser-
tion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism of a 287-bp Alu-repeat
sequence in intron 16 of the ACE gene that was identified
and for which three different genotypes (II, ID, DD) have
been characterised. These three genotypes display distinct
ACE plasma activities of which the DD genotype is
responsible for the high activity of the enzyme.18,19 Studies
have demonstrated that ACE I/D polymorphism is associ-
ated with hypertension,20 nephropathy,21 elevated glu-
cose,22 coronary artery disease,13 plasma triglyceride, total
cholesterol levels, abdominal fat accumulation, central
obesity and weight gain.23
An ample number of studies has recently focused on the
ACE I/D polymorphism in association with MS; however,
some results have been inconsistent.11,14,24­27 The effects of
ACE polymorphism on the improvement of components
of the MS profile in response to a multifaceted obesity-
management programme, addressed using a multidiscipli-
nary team, has not been clarified in obese adolescents.
Thus the aim of the present study was to investigate
whether I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene might affect
metabolic changes related to MS through long-term inter-
disciplinary therapy in obese adolescents.
Methods
Subjects
A total of 198 obese adolescents (77 boys and 121 girls)
aged between 15 and 19 years who entered the interdisci-
plinary obesity programme of the Federal University of
São Paulo ­ Escola Paulista de Medicina were assigned to
the following two subgroups: MS or non-metabolic syn-
drome (n-MS). Those who were considered to have MS
presented with three or more criteria of the International
Diabetes Federation.28 Both groups were submitted for
weight loss therapy. The evaluations were performed at
baseline and after 1 year of an interdisciplinary approach.
The ages of the participants ranged from 15 to 19 years,
and they all presented with simple obesity (body mass
index (BMI) >95th percentile).29 The inclusion criteria for
the post-pubertal stage were based on the Tanner scale
stage 5,30 for both boys and girls. Non-inclusion criteria
were as follows: other metabolic or endocrine diseases,
such as hypothyroidism and Cushing syndrome; chronic
alcohol consumption; previous use of drugs, such as ana-
bolic androgenic steroids or psychotropics, which may
affect appetite regulation; and pregnancy. The study was
carried out in accordance with the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethical
committee of the Federal University of São Paulo. Written
informed consent was obtained from all subjects and/or
their parents. The clinical trial registration number was
NCT01358773, and this study has been archived in
ClinicalTrials.gov.
Serum analysis
Blood samples were collected in the outpatient clinic
approximately 8 hours after an overnight fast. Insulin
resistance was assessed by the homeostasis model
assessment­insulin resistance (HOMA­IR) index, and
it was calculated using fasting blood glucose (FBG)
and immunoreactive insulin (I), as follows: (FBG (mg/
dL)×I (mU/L))/405. The concentrations of total cho-
lesterol, glucose (commercial Beckman Coulter glu-
cose kit, ref: OSR6221), insulin (commercial Architect
Insulin reagent kit, ref: 8K41-27), triglycerides, high-
density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein
(LDL)-cholesterol and very low density lipoprotein
(VLDL)-cholesterol were determined and analysed by
an automatic Beckman Coulter (Brea, California,
USA) with a enzymatic colorimetric method (CELM,
Barueri, Brazil). The HOMA­IR data were analysed
Almeida et al. 3
according to reference values reported by Schwimmer
et al.,31 and the cut-off adopted for adolescents was
3.16.32
ACE genotyping
Genomic DNA was extracted from circulating leukocytes
using a blood DNA extraction kit (ChargeSwitch gDNA
blood kits, Invitrogen). The ACE I/D polymorphism was
genotyped as described in Almeida et al.18 in 198 subjects
with obesity. The sense primer was ECAS 5-CTGGAGA
CCACTCCCATCCTTTCT-3, and the antisense primer was
ECAR 5-GATGTGGCCATCACATTCGTCAGAT-3. Each
subject gave informed consent before collection of blood
for DNA extraction at the beginning of the experimental
procedure.
Anthropometric variables and body composition
Body mass (kg), height (m), BMI (kg/m2) and waist cir-
cumference were measured according to previously
adopted procedures.33 Body composition was measured
by plethysmography in a BOD POD body composition
system (version 1.69; Life Measurement Instruments,
Concord, CA, USA).34 Visceral and subcutaneous fat
were estimated using abdominal ultrasonography as
described in Masquio et al.33 Cut-off points to define vis-
ceral obesity by ultrasonography parameters were based
on previous methodological descriptions by Ribeiro-
Filho et al.35
Multidisciplinary intervention
The multidisciplinary intervention consisted of medical
follow-up, psychological therapy, nutritional and exercise
programmes. Details of all procedures can be found in de
Carvalho-Ferreira et al.36
Statistical analysis
The SPSS statistical package version 22.0 for Mac (SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical evaluation, and
graphics were produced using GraphPad version 6.0
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The Gaussian
distribution of variables (including  values) was verified
with a Kolmogorov­Smirnov test.Variables were expressed
as the mean±SEM. Comparisons between measures at
baseline, after the weight loss intervention and between
groups were made using the univariate general linear model
followed by a Bonferroni post-test. Genotype frequencies
observed in our cohort were in Hardy­Weinberg equilib-
rium. Differences were considered significant at P<0.05.
Statistical data are provided in the figures.
Results
Baseline
A total of 198 obese adolescents were enrolled in the pro-
gramme; however, 125 obese adolescents (45 boys and 80
girls) completed 1 year of the interdisciplinary obesity pro-
gramme and more than 75% of the treatment sessions of the
Federal University of São Paulo ­ Escola Paulista de
Medicina. In the present study, the patients were analysed
as two groups according to MS diagnosis, as follows: MS
or non-MS; 40% fit the criteria for MS. The genotype and
allele frequency of the ACE I/D polymorphism are listed in
Table 1. The genotype frequency distributions of this
polymorphism in the study did not differ between n-MS
and MS and were all in accordance with Hardy­Weinberg
equilibrium.
When analysing the prevalence of the alterations
between groups, it was observed that HDL was the most
frequently altered parameter. Figure 1 illustrates the dif-
ferent percentages among the alterations between the
genotypes.
Body composition
When analysing the difference between groups (MS vs.
n-MS), it was observed that the genotypes ID and DD in
the MS group presented a higher body mass (kg) and waist
circumference when compared with the same genotypes in
the n-MS group. The body composition data are summa-
rised in Supplementary Table 1.

Metabolic parameters
When analysing the difference between groups (MS vs.
n-MS), it was observed that the three genotypes in the MS
group presented a lower HDL level than that of the same
genotype of n-MS. Considering carriers of the D allele
from the MS group, higher values of systolic blood pres-
sure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and triglycer-
ides were observed. In analysing insulin levels, the HOMA
index and LDL levels, the genotype ID presented higher
values in the MS group when compared with the same
genotypes in the n-MS group. All metabolic data are pre-
sented in Supplementary Table 2.
Comparison within the groups
When analysing the differences within the group, the sub-
jects with the DD genotype showed significantly higher
LDL than the subjects with the II genotype in the n-MS
group. This genotype also showed higher VLDL when
compared with the ID genotype in the same group.
After therapy
Body composition.
Regarding body composition, both
groups (n-MS and MS) showed significant improvements
in the body mass (kg), BMI, body fat (kg and %), fat-free
mass (kg and %), visceral fat, subcutaneous fat and waist
circumference measurements (Figure 2; Supplementary
Table 1).
When analysing the difference between groups (n-MS
vs. MS) after therapy, it was observed that the ID and DD
genotypes in the MS group presented an increase in fat-
free mass (kg) when compared with the same genotypes in
the n-MS group. The II genotype in the MS group showed
a greater decrease in subcutaneous fat when compared
with the same genotype in the n-MS group. We observed a
reduction in the visceral­subcutaneous ratio in the ID and
DD genotypes of n-MS, while this reduction was observed
only in the DD genotype in the MS group. These data are
presented in Supplementary Table 1.
Metabolic parameters
Both groups presented significant improvements in the
insulin levels in ID and DD genotypes (n-MS) as well in II
and ID genotypes (MS). In the MS group, the DD geno-
type remained unchanged after therapy. Considering the
difference between the two groups (n-MS vs. MS), the ID
genotype in the MS group had a greater delta value than
the same genotype in the n-MS group (Figure 3).
Regarding the lipid profile, the ID and DD genotypes
from both groups (n-MS and MS) exhibited significantly
reduced LDL-cholesterol, while VLDL-cholesterol was
reduced only in the n-MS group with the DD genotype. On
the other hand, all MS genotypes were able to reduce tri-
glyceride levels significantly. Comparing the same geno-
types between the two groups, we observed that subjects
with ID and DD genotypes in the MS group had signifi-
cantly lower HDL levels when compared with the same
genotypes in the n-MS group. In addition, both ID and DD
genotypes presented higher VLDL and triglycerides than
subjects from the n-MS group. In the analysis of the LDL,
we observed significant differences in the ID genotype
compared with the same genotype in the n-MS group.
Although the MS group exhibited a significantly improved
LDL­HDL ratio, this group still presented with higher val-
ues in all three genotypes in relation to n-MS. All meta-
bolic data are presented in Supplementary Table 2.
Concerning SBP, the MS group showed a significant
reduction in ID and DD genotypes, and it was observed
that none of the genotypes had a significant reduction in
the n-MS group. We observed that the ID genotype in the
MS group maintained differences with regard to the same
genotype in the n-MS group after therapy. Only the DD
genotype in the n-MS group and ID from the MS group
presented significant reductions in DBP after therapy. We

Body composition. Subjects with the II genotype in the n-MS
group presented a lower significant difference in body
composition components and did not show a significance
difference in body mass (kg), BMI and subcutaneous fat.
However, only the II carriers of the n-MS group showed
increases in fat-free mass, while individuals with ID and
DD genotypes did not show changes in their fat-free mass
(Figure 2). Carriers of the DD genotype also did not present
differences in waist circumference in the n-MS group.
However, analysing the visceral­subcutaneous ratio, we

observed a reduction in ID and DD in the n-MS group and
only in the DD genotype in the MS group (Supplementary
Table 1).
Metabolic parameters
Analysing the metabolic parameters of the ID and DD
genotypes in the n-MS group, both showed a significantly
improved insulin response, while the II and ID genotypes
in the MS group also showed a significantly improved
insulin response. This result is the opposite of that of the
subjects with the DD genotype, who did not show changes
in their insulin levels after therapy. In synergy with these
results, while the genotypes II and ID improved HOMA­
IR, the DD genotype increased significantly (Figure 3).
Considering lipid metabolism, in the MS group only car-
riers of the D allele improved LDL, while HDL and VLDL
did not respond to intervention. Regarding HDL-cholesterol
and LDL­HDL ratios, we observed a significant reduction
only in the ID and DD genotypes in the n-MS group.
Moreover, the carriers of the D allele in the MS group
showed increased triglyceride­HDL ratio values. Finally,
the MS group showed a significant reduction of SBP in the
ID and DD genotypes (Supplementary Table 2).
Discussion
The main purpose of the present study was to investigate
whether the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene might
affect metabolic changes related to MS through a long-
term interdisciplinary therapy in obese adolescents. The
most important finding is that we have shown that genetic
alteration in the ACE gene may influence the benefits of an
interdisciplinary therapy in obese adolescents with and
without MS.
It is important to emphasise that, for the first time, we
have demonstrated that the II genotype might have a
favourable effect on the improvement of body composi-
tion in obese adolescents without MS when compared with
the DD genotype. In agreement with this, the II genotype
presented better results regarding glucose metabolism
when compared with the ID and DD genotypes in the MS
group. Finally, the II genotype seemed to impair improve-
ment in lipid metabolism when compared with ID and DD
in both groups.
As previously demonstrated by our group,37 improve-
ment in body composition was observed in both groups
after an interdisciplinary weight loss therapy. However,
when we stratified the groups by ACE genotype, the result
was different; the II genotype showed significant improve-
ment in fat-free mass in the n-MS group when compared
with ID and DD within the same group.
As mentioned before, the I-carry allele is associated with
higher levels of bradykinin, which could partly justify these
results. Bradykinin stimulates protein synthesis pathways,
including the Pi3K/AKT/m-TOR pathway. The proposed
mechanism is based on the role of bradykinin in increasing
the IRS receptor phosphorylation, which activates the
AKT­mTOR pathway, favouring protein synthesis.17,38
Corroborating results obtained by the group of Popadic
Gacesa39 provided evidence of a positive relationship
between another polymorphism that can result in an increase
in bradykinin signaling and a better response to an exercise
intervention for which the goal was improving muscle mass
in young men (Figure 4).
Interestingly, it has recently been shown that an increase
in free-fat mass, in response to exercise training, may
enhance some myokines, including increased secretion of
FGF-21 in muscle, mediation in white adipose tissue and
brown adipose tissue (BAT), the browning phenomenon
and an increase in thermogenesis in humans. Moreover,
there is consensus on the presence of BAT in humans and
its potential consequences on energy metabolism, glucose
regulation and blood lipid balance.40
In addition, it has been suggested that exercise could
exert a key role in BAT metabolism. Exercise training
might activate and recruit human BAT through activation
of the sympathetic nervous system, heart and skeletal mus-
cle. However, more investigations for understanding
which type of exercise, the different effects of intensity,
and how much time is needed to induce an effective BAT
activation and recruitment in humans with obesity and MS
is needed.41
All together, these results may suggest the importance
of increases in free-fat mass after weight loss, as shown in
the present study. In order to ameliorate both factors, the
energy balance and whole body metabolism avoid undesir-
able yo-yo effects and the inflammatory state related to
obesity, which may lead to the development of MS and
cardiometabolic risks.
Another interesting result observed in the present
investigation was that only I-carry alleles presented an
improvement in insulin and HOMA­IR in the MS group,
demonstrating that the DD genotype presented impairment
of glucose metabolism. It is well established in the litera-
ture that bradykinin is capable of positively influencing
glucose uptake.17 Bradykinin acts via a synergistic mecha-
nism with the pathway of insulin and by translocation of
GLUT-4 in an independent manner.42 Thus, considering
that the literature has strongly demonstrated that DD geno-
types present lower values of bradykinin, this could partly
explain the difference between the genotypes after inter-
disciplinary therapy. A possible mechanism involved in
I/D polymorphism and glucose homeostasis is also shown
in Figure 4.
Insulin resistance is one of the strongest predictors of
many chronic diseases in adolescents, including MS, non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), diabetes, dyslipi-
daemia and others. Therefore, the improvement of insulin
sensitivity in the presence of MS in obese adolescents may
Almeida et al. 7
benefit obesity control as well as its above-mentioned
comorbidities. In addition, it was previously shown that
after weight loss therapy, an increase in adiponectin medi-
ates the improvements in insulin resistance in obese ado-
lescents, leading to a reduction in the prevalence of MS
and NAFLD.43,44
However, regarding lipid metabolism, the framework
seems to be different in the present study. The II genotype
in the MS group presented a worse lipid profile at baseline
that did not improve after treatment. This result indicates
that, besides the unfavourable lipid profile at baseline, this
genotype also presents difficulty in responding positively
to the intervention because it is expected that lifestyle
changes are able to modulate the lipid profile. D-carrier
allele genotypes seemed to respond better, demonstrated
by an increase in HDL-cholesterol and decreases in
LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides in the MS group, while
the II genotype was able to improve triglyceride levels
only (Figure 4).
These effects can be modulated partially by the conver-
sion of bradykinin in Des-Arg-9-BK, which is able to bind
the B1 kinin receptor. It is well known that these receptors
are expressed only in pro-inflammatory conditions, which
are observed in the present population, especially in the
MS group.45 Experimental studies showed that B1 receptor
knockout mice, which were submitted to a high-fat diet,
presented a more favourable lipid profile when compared
with wild-type mice.46 Thus, considering that the I-carry
allele has higher bradykinin levels, more substrate may be
available for the conversion of bradykinin in Des-Arg-
9-BK. However, clinical studies to confirm this are recom-
mended in the analysed population.

In addition, research in which experimental models of
obesity and insulin resistance were evaluated shows that B1
kinin expression, especially in the liver, was involved with
disturbances in lipid metabolism, through mechanisms
related to oxidative stress.47 It is important to highlight that,
despite the temporary blockade of this receptor being able
to restore lipid homeostasis, this intervention does not
provide improvements in insulin resistance, showing the
influences of these receptors in lipid metabolism, without
modifying glucose uptake, corroborating our data.45
Finally, the control of lipid profiles in both obesity and
MS groups is desirable because MS is present in 32% of
Brazilian adolescents with obesity. In eutrophic American
children (NHANES III), this prevalence was only approxi-
mately 0.1%. In addition, we were able to show that
50% of obese adolescents have a diagnosis of NAFLD.
Unfortunately, after weight loss therapy, some of them
continue with MS and NAFLD, showing the importance
of controlling lipid profiles in this population in order to
prevent cardiovascular diseases.2,48­50
Currently, identifying obesity-resistant genotypes and how
they respond to different therapies is becoming extremely
interesting, as obesity has reached epidemic proportions glob-
ally. In the present study, genetic variation in the ACE gene
influences the response to interdisciplinary treatment in dif-
ferent ways, acting positively in glucose metabolism and pro-
tein synthesis and negatively on lipid profiles. Once the role
of different polymorphisms is established, a more efficient
and personalised treatment can be designed.
Nevertheless, to our knowledge, the current study is the
first investigation showing the influence of these specific
polymorphisms in response to a long-term interdiscipli-
nary therapy in obese adolescents, and is an important
issue for clinical practice. The limitations of the present
study include the sample size and the lack of the quantifi-
cation of kinin peptides. These issues may be explored in
future studies.
Conclusion
The multicomponent intervention was able to improve
body composition and metabolism among obese adoles-
cents. In the present study, we showed that the ACE poly-
morphism was able to influence positively fat-free mass in
I-carry allele genotypes in the n-MS group. In addition, the
I-carry allele was able to improve significantly insulin
resistance in the MS group. Conversely, I-carry allele gen-
otypes seemed to hamper lipid profile improvement in the
MS group. The results suggest that the genotypes can
influence, in different ways and in specific parameters, the
metabolism of Brazilian obese adolescents.
