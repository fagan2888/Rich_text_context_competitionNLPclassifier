Abstract
Background: Overweight and obesity have become a global epidemic. The prevalence of overweight and obesity
among U.S. adolescents has almost tripled in the last 30 years. Results from recent systematic reviews demonstrate
that no single, particular intervention or strategy successfully assists overweight or obese adolescents in losing
weight. An understanding of factors that influence healthy weight-loss behaviors among overweight and obese
female adolescents promotes effective, multi-component weight-loss interventions. There is limited evidence
demonstrating associations between demographic variables, body-mass index, and weight perception among
female adolescents trying to lose weight. There is also a lack of previous studies examining the association of the
accuracy of female adolescents' weight perception with their efforts to lose weight. This study, therefore, examined
the associations of body-mass index, weight perception, and weight-perception accuracy with trying to lose
weight and engaging in exercise as a weight-loss method among a representative sample of U.S. female
adolescents.
Methods: A nonexperimental, descriptive, comparative secondary analysis design was conducted using data from
Wave II (1996) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Data representative of U.S.
female adolescents (N = 2216) were analyzed using STATA statistical software. Descriptive statistics and survey
weight logistic regression were performed to determine if demographic and independent (body-mass index,
weight perception, and weight perception accuracy) variables were associated with trying to lose weight and
engaging in exercise as a weight-loss method.
Results: Age, Black or African American race, body-mass index, weight perception, and weight perceptions
accuracy were consistently associated with the likeliness of trying to lose weight among U.S. female adolescents.
Age, body-mass index, weight perception, and weight-perception accuracy were positively associated (p < 0.05)
with trying to lose weight. Black/African American subjects were significantly less likely than their White
counterparts to be trying to lose weight. There was no association between demographic or independent variables
and engaging in exercise as a weight-loss method.
Conclusions: Findings suggest that factors influencing weight-loss efforts, including age, race, body-mass index,
weight perception, and weight-perception accuracy, should be incorporated into existing or new multi-component
weight-loss interventions for U.S. adolescent females in order to help reduce the national epidemic of overweight
and obesity among U.S. female adolescents.

Background
Due to the increased worldwide prevalence of over-
weight and obesity, health care officials consider over-
weight and obesity a global epidemic [1,2], especially
among young people. The latest estimates among chil-
dren and adolescents in 34 countries indicate a preva-
lence of overweight ranging from 5.1% to 25.4% and
obesity from 0.4% to 7.9%. Overweight and obesity also
represent a national epidemic in the United States,
where the prevalence of overweight and obesity has
almost tripled among children and adolescents in the
last 30 years. Data from the National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey indicate the prevalence of over-
weight U.S. adolescents (12 to 19 years old) increased
from 6.1% in 1971-1974 to 18% in 2005-2006, placing
the United States second among countries with the
highest incidence of overweight and obesity (25.1%) [1,3]
Under the influence of numerous factors, overweight
and obesity develop from an imbalance between energy
intake and expenditure [4,5]. Overweight and obesity in
childhood and adolescence can lead to consequences
extending into adulthood, such as type 2 diabetes,
hypertension, atherosclerosis, and poor quality of life
[4]. To avoid such consequences, developing effective
interventions for overweight and obese children and
adolescents has become a major public health issue [6].
Results from recent systematic reviews demonstrate that
no single, particular intervention or strategy successfully
assists overweight or obese adolescents in losing weight
[7,8]. Instead, researchers suggest that effective interven-
tions for adolescents consist of multiple components,
including behaviour skills, behaviour change, and paren-
tal involvement to promote healthy diet and nutrition
and to increase physical activity (PA)/exercise [7-9].
Despite recommendations for healthy weight-loss
behaviours, adolescents engage in numerous unhealthy
weight-loss behaviours [10], such as taking diet pills,
laxatives, and diuretics, employing self-induced vomit-
ing, and skipping meals [11-14]. Evidence suggests that
female adolescents engage in unhealthy weight-loss
behaviours more frequently than do male adolescents
[11,13]. In addition, unhealthy weight-loss behaviours
are more likely to occur among overweight or obese
female adolescents [15,16] and among female adoles-
cents who perceive themselves to be overweight or
obese [17,18]. Consequently, female adolescents need
effective, multi-component, weight-loss interventions
that promote healthy weight-loss behaviours.
An increased understanding of factors that influence
female adolescents' desire to lose weight and their
choice of health-promoting weight-loss behaviours will
help develop more effective weight-loss interventions.
Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to
determine whether body-mass index (BMI) and weight
perception are associated with trying to lose weight and
engaging in exercise as a weight-loss method among
U.S. female adolescents.
Review of the Literature
The following literature review was conducted in order
to identify what is known and not known about the
variables under consideration in this secondary analysis
study. The strengths of previously conducted studies
considering similar variables included the use of large
probability samples representative of U.S. and interna-
tional populations of adolescents, objective measure-
ments of height and weight, and consideration of
associations between variables and trying to lose weight
among female adolescents. However, these previous
relevant studies also included the following limitations:
convenience samples that limited generalizability beyond
the studies' population; participants' self-reports of
height and weight; and the researchers' use of tools
with insufficiently reported and/or lack of validity and
reliability, which undermined external and internal
validity and included various classifications of actual
weight (BMI) and weight perception. Considering such
limitations and in an effort to improve the ability to
synthesize previous findings, only studies that used
probability-sampling methods were included in the fol-
lowing literature review.
Researchers report a significant percentage of adoles-
cents are trying to lose weight, ranging from approxi-
mately 34% to 42% in the United States [16,19] to 61%
in Quebec, Canada [20]. The most consistent demo-
graphic finding is that female adolescents in the United
States [15,21,22] and worldwide [22-24] are significantly
more likely to be trying to lose weight than are their
male counterparts. For example, Ojala et al. [22]. esti-
mated that, among their sample of adolescents from
over 30 countries, 19.8% female adolescents were trying
to lose weight compared to 7.5% male adolescents in
their cross-national 2007 survey.
A limited number of studies have considered demo-
graphic variables other than nationality, such as race/
ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status (SES), among
adolescents trying to lose weight. Research findings of
U.S. adolescents demonstrate either that no relationship
exists between race/ethnicity and trying to lose weight
[21] or that Black/African American female adolescents
are less likely to be trying to lose weight than their His-
panic and White/non-Hispanic White counterparts
[11,25]. In addition, study findings show a significant
positive relationship between age and trying to lose
weight in U.S. adolescents [26] and worldwide [22], in
that older adolescents are more likely to be trying to

lose weight. Lastly, among demographic variables in a
sample of female adolescents from five major U.S. cities,
researchers found no evidence of a relationship between
SES (as measured by parental education) and trying to
control or lose weight [21].
Previous study findings indicate BMI and weight per-
ception are associated with obese and overweight ado-
lescents' efforts to lose weight. Researchers report that a
significant positive association exists between trying to
lose weight and BMI among adolescents in the United
States and internationally [20,22,23,27,28]. Furthermore,
findings indicate that obese female adolescents are sig-
nificantly more likely to be trying to lose weight than
overweight female adolescents [22]. Researchers also
report that a relatively large percentage of U.S. adoles-
cents who perceive themselves as overweight are trying
to lose weight (70.3%) [26], with greater percentages of
White/non-Hispanic White adolescent females who per-
ceive themselves as "too fat" trying to lose weight, com-
pared to Hispanic and Black/African American
adolescents [16]. These data and associations are lim-
ited, however, as the only significant positive association
between weight perception and trying to lose weight
was reported among a sample of adolescents in Beirut,
Lebanon [23]. However, again, the finding is limited due
to its lack of generalizability.
Studies present conflicting data on whether U.S. ado-
lescent females are significantly more likely [11,26,29] or
less likely [15,25] than U.S. adolescent males to exercise
as a means to control and/or lose weight. Nevertheless,
study findings indicate exercise is the most common
behaviour among U.S. and international female adoles-
cents trying to control or lose weight [22,28]. Research-
ers also report that African American [15,25] and
Hispanic [25] female adolescents in the United States
are significantly less likely to exercise than their White
counterparts. Although no studies have considered the
association between adolescents' weight perception and
engaging in exercise to trying to lose weight, researchers
report a significant positive relationship between BMI
and engaging in exercise to trying to lose weight among
U.S. female adolescents [25].
Thus, based on findings reported in the literature,
female adolescents are more likely than male adoles-
cents to be trying to lose weight and are most likely to
engage in exercise to do so. However, limited evidence
demonstrates associations between demographic vari-
ables, BMI, and weight perception among female adoles-
cents trying to lose weight. Furthermore, previous
studies have not examined the association of the accu-
racy of female adolescents' weight perception with their
efforts to lose weight. To fill this gap in the literature,
the current study focused on identifying whether BMI
and weight perception are associated with trying to lose
weight and engaging in exercise as a weight-loss method
among U.S. female adolescents. This study addressed
the following research questions: (a) Are BMI and
weight perception associated with trying to lose weight
among female adolescents, controlling for age, race/eth-
nicity, and SES?; and (b) Are BMI, weight perception,
and trying to lose weight associated with female adoles-
cents' report of engaging in exercise as a weight-loss
method, controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and SES?
Methods
Design
The current study was a nonexperimental, descriptive,
comparatory secondary analysis of data from the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health [30].
n.d.a). Add Health was a longitudinal, school-based
study that collected data on a variety of health-related
behaviours in a nationally representative sample of U.S.
adolescents in grades 7 through 12. Using a multistage,
stratified, school-based cluster sampling design, Add
Health subjects were first enrolled during the adminis-
tration of an in-school questionnaire in 1994 (Wave I,
Stage 1). One year later, additional subjects from school
rosters were enrolled during in-home interviews (Wave
1, Stage 2; N = 20,745). Add Health subjects were subse-
quently followed over time during in-home interviews 2
and 6 years later: Wave II (1996; N = 14,738) and Wave
III (2000; N = 15,170) [30].
Sample for the Present Study
The present study included females aged 13 to 18 years
old on whom data were collected during in-home inter-
views at Wave I and Wave II of the Add Health study.
Female subjects were excluded if they (a) were not
included in the core sample; (b) were younger than
13 years or older than 18 years at Wave II; (c) were
missing data for age, race/ethnicity, or SES; (d) reported
pregnancy at Wave II; and (e) were determined to be
physically disabled during data collected at Wave II. The
Add Health public-use data set provides data for more
than 2,000 female adolescents at Wave II who met
inclusion criteria. Due to the large sample available for
the present study, a power analysis was deemed unne-
cessary upon statistical consultation.
Data Collection
Data for the present study were obtained from data col-
lected from the Add Health study. From April to
August 1996, highly structured in-home interviews were
conducted by trained interviewers using computer-
assisted self-interview for Add Health Wave II data col-
lection [31]. All measures were self-reported, except for
height and weight, which were measured by the trained
interviewers immediately following the interview.

Demographic data for the current study were obtained
from the Add Health Wave I in-home interviews (Stage
2), which followed the same data-collection procedures
as described for Wave II. Although further information
is available from the Add Health Web site http://www.
cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth, Add Health-sponsored
publications lack information regarding the validity and
reliability of the study's in-home interviews. In addition,
recommended techniques were not available in the cur-
rent secondary analysis study [32].
Measures
Demographic Variables
Each subject's age was calculated by subtracting the sub-
ject's date of birth from the date of data collection
recorded on the laptop computer used for data collec-
tion. Subjects ethnicity was identified as Hispanic or
Latino or not Hispanic or Latino. Subjects also self-iden-
tified themselves into one of the following race cate-
gories: White, Black or African American, American
Indian or Native American, or Asian or Pacific Islander.
For the current study, subjects' socioeconomic status
was operationalized to include two separate measures.
Research on health-disparities lacks accepted measures
of socioeconomic status [33-35]. Although single and
composite measures exist, evidence suggests that occu-
pation may not be a useful indicator of adolescents' SES
and that educational attainment, which is not inter-
changeable with family income, is the most widely used
indicator of adolescents' SES [33,35]. Therefore, in the
current study, the two operationalized measures for SES
were highest maternal educational attainment and family
income [1994 household total income (in thousands of
dollars) before-tax and household income received in
1994 (including income from all household members,
dividends, welfare benefits, and other sources)].
Body-Mass Index
The measure used for actual weight, BMI, was calcu-
lated as weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in
meters) [kg/m2]. Although standardized classification
systems of overweight and obesity for adolescents do
not exist, classifying adolescents' weight based on age-
and gender-specific BMI cut-off points is accepted
worldwide [36]. In the present study, classifications from
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
were used to identify female adolescents' BMI for age
and gender as obese (> 95th percentile), overweight (85th
to 95th percentile), or normal weight (< 85th percentile).
Dichotomous variables were created to identify subjects
as obese or overweight.
Weight Perception
As an important perceptual dimension of body image,
weight perception is defined as the perception of one's
body weight [37]. In the Add Health Wave II in-home
interviews, subjects' weight perception was assessed by
the question, "How do you think of yourself in terms of
weight?" Response choices included "very underweight,"
"slightly underweight," "about the right weight," "slightly
overweight," or "very overweight." The responses of
"very underweight," "slightly underweight," and "about
the right weight" were collapsed into a single "not over-
weight" response of weight perception.
Accuracy of Weight Perception
To measure the accuracy of subjects' weight perception,
each subject's BMI and weight perception were com-
pared. From this comparison, four variables were cre-
ated. The first variable (reference category) indicated
subjects who were not overweight or obese and per-
ceived themselves in any of the weight perception cate-
gories (very underweight, slightly underweight, about
the right weight, slightly overweight, or very over-
weight). The second variable indicated overweight or
obese subjects who underestimated their weight. Despite
being overweight or obese, these subjects did not per-
ceive themselves as overweight (weight perception was
very underweight, slightly underweight, or about the
right weight (Overweight or Obese, Not Overweight
weight perception). The third and fourth variables indi-
cated subjects with a degree of accuracy in their weight
perception. These subjects were overweight or obese
and perceived themselves as either slightly overweight
(Overweight or Obese, Slightly Overweight weight percep-
tion) or very overweight (Overweight or Obese, Very
Overweight weight perception) (Table 1). Due to the
small number of female subjects who were obese and
perceived themselves very overweight (n = 88), it was
not possible to construct a separate weight perception
accuracy variable for subjects whose BMI percentile
indicated they were obese.
Trying to Lose Weight
To determine whether subjects were currently trying to
lose weight, responses to the question, "Are you trying
to lose weight, gain weight, or stay the same weight?"
were examined. To create a variable that identified sub-
jects who were currently trying to lose weight, the
responses "gain weight" and "stay the same weight" were
collapsed together into "not trying to lose weight."
Engaging in Exercise as a Weight-Loss Method
An aim of this study was to determine whether BMI and
weight perception are associated with trying to lose

weight and reports of engaging in exercise as a weight-
loss method among U.S. female adolescents. Upon
determining subjects were trying to lose weight, they
were identified as engaging in exercise to try to lose
weight if they answered "yes" to the "Exercise" response
to the question, "During the past seven days, which of
the following did you do in order to lose weight or keep
from gaining weight?"
Data Analysis
Data were analyzed using STATA, a statistical software
package, to account for the Add Health study's cluster
sampling with unequal probability design and using Add
Health sampling weights for cross-sectional analyses,
which allowed for a nationally representative sample of
U.S. female adolescents [38]. Results were considered
statistically significant if the p-value was less than of
0.05. Initial analyses included descriptive statistics for
sample characteristics and a summary statistics of vari-
ables. Chi square statistics determined relationships
between dichotomous variables. After determining the
presence of low to modest correlations between all inde-
pendent variables (ranging from -0.2232 to 0.4889) in
each model, survey-weighted logistic regression was per-
formed to determine the effect of a dichotomous or
continuous independent variable on the probability of a
dichotomous dependent variable. Wald tests, when
appropriate, were performed to determine the signifi-
cance between the independent variable and dependent
variable [39]. For each of the current study's research
questions, three models were used to predict the depen-
dent variable. The first model contained only demo-
graphic variables. The second model contained
demographic variables as well as BMI and weight per-
ception as independent variables. The third model con-
tained demographic variables and variables indicating
subjects' weight perception accuracy as independent
variables.
Results
Sample Description
Of the 2,510 subjects in the Add Health public-use data
core sample, a total of 2,216 subjects were eligible for
secondary analysis in the current study, after applying
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects were 13 to 18
years old (M = 15.8, SD = 1.5), with the majority
between 15 and 17 years old. As shown in Table 2,
which depicts the sample's demographic variables, most
subjects were non-Hispanic (88%) and White (69%);
however, other ethnic (Hispanic) and race categories
(Black or African American, American Indian or Native
American, and Asian or Pacific Islander) were also
represented in the sample. Although 85.1% of the sub-
jects' mothers reported having graduated from high
school or earned a General Equivalency Diploma, this
percentage was slightly lower than the 1994 percentage
(91.6%) of educational achievement rates for a high
school diploma or greater in the U.S. for females 24 to
64 years old [40]. In addition, the subjects' median total
household income ($40,000) was slightly higher than
that of U.S. households in 1994 ($32,264) [41].
Weight Related Variables
Body-Mass Index
The majority of female adolescents in this study sample
were not overweight or obese (72.63%) (see Table 3).
However, significant racial differences existed in the
sample's weight status. Black/African American and
American Indian/Native American female adolescents
had the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity.
Chi-square statistics indicated Black/African American
female adolescents were significantly more likely to be
overweight or obese than female adolescents who were
White, Asian/Pacific Islander, or in the race category of
"Other" (p < 0.01). American Indian/Native American
female adolescents were significantly more likely to be
overweight or obese than White (p < 0.05) or Asian/
Pacific Islander (p < 0.01) female adolescents. Asian/

Pacific Islander female adolescents were the least likely
to be overweight compared to female adolescents in all
other racial categories (p < 0.01).
Weight Perception
In the study's sample, most female adolescents perceived
themselves as not overweight (60.99%) (see Table 3).
American Indian/Native American female adolescents
and female adolescents in the "Other" race category
were most likely to perceive themselves as overweight.
Chi-square statistics demonstrated that American
Indian/Native American and "Other" female adolescents
were significantly more likely than Black/African Ameri-
can female adolescents to perceive themselves as
overweight (p < 0.05). Subjects in the "Other" race
category were also significantly more likely than their
White counterparts to perceive themselves as over-
weight (p < 0.05).
Accuracy of Weight Perception
In addition to descriptive statistics, chi square statistics
demonstrated a significant difference in the accuracy of
female adolescents' weight perception, based on their
actual BMI weight classification. Of the female adoles-
cents who were overweight or obese, 79.06% accurately
perceived themselves as either slightly or very over-
weight (p < 0.05). In addition, almost 20% of the over-
weight or obese female adolescents inaccurately
underestimated their weight as not overweight (see
Table 4).
Significant racial differences also existed in the sub-
jects' accuracy of weight perception. Overweight or
obese Black/African American female adolescents were
more likely to underestimate their weight than were
White (p < 0.01), Asian (p < 0.01), or Other (p < 0.05)
female adolescents. In addition, overweight or obese
American Indian/Native American female adolescents
were significantly more likely than their Asian counter-
parts to underestimate their weight (p < 0.05).
Trying to Lose Weight
Approximately half of the female adolescents in the
sample were currently trying to lose weight, while the
other half indicated they were not currently trying to
lose weight (see Table 3). Across all models used in the
study, age was significantly associated with trying to lose
weight: With each increasing year in age, subjects were
more likely to be trying to lose weight (OR = 1.07-1.18,
p < 0.05) (see Table 5). In the third model (demographic
variables, plus variables indicating weight perception
accuracy), race was significantly associated with trying
to lose weight: Black/African American subjects were
0.6 times less likely to be trying to lose weight than
their White counterparts. A significant positive associa-
tion with also emerged between BMI and weight per-
ception. Overweight and obese subjects were two to
four times more likely to be trying to lose weight than
subjects who were not overweight or obese. Also, sub-
jects who perceived themselves as slightly or very over-
weight were 13 to 25 times more likely to be trying to
lose weight than subjects who did not perceive them-
selves as slightly or very overweight (see Table 5).
Wald statistics indicated that, compared to the over-
weight subjects, the obese subjects were significantly
more likely to be trying to lose weight (F = 6.72, p <
0.0006), with no difference between a weight perception
of slightly overweight and very overweight (F = -0.96,
p 0.392). In addition, compared to the variable of BMI,
the variable of weight perception was significantly asso-
ciated with greater odds of trying to lose weight; Wald
statistics were significant (p < 0.05) for the difference
between these two variables. All weight perception accu-
racy variables were also positively associated with trying
to lose weight. Overweight or obese subjects who accu-
rately perceived their weight as either slightly or very
overweight were significantly more likely to be trying to
lose weight than overweight or obese subjects who inac-
curately underestimated their weight as not overweight
(F = 38.94, F = 17.98, respectively p = 0.000). Although
subjects who were overweight or obese and perceived
themselves as overweight were the most likely to be try-
ing to lose weight (OR = 22.62), no significant difference
emerged between these subjects and those who were
overweight or obese and perceived themselves as slightly
overweight (F = 0.72, p = 0.3690).
Engaging in Exercise as a Weight-Loss Method
Among the subjects who were currently trying to lose
weight (46.95%), the majority reported engaging in

exercise as a weight-loss method (76.54%) (see Table 3).
However, BMI, weight perception, and weight percep-
tion accuracy were not associated with the odds of enga-
ging in exercise as a weight-loss method. Across all of
the study's models, only the maternal educational attain-
ment category of completing a General Equivalency
Diploma was significantly associated with the likeliness
of engaging in exercise as a weight-loss method (see
Table 6). However, interpretation of this significance
may be considered inappropriate because the General
Equivalency Diploma category was one of multiple cate-
gories for maternal educational attainment that con-
sisted of a small proportion of subjects (4.75%).
Discussion
Body-mass index, weight perception, and weight percep-
tion accuracy were positively associated with trying to
lose weight in the study's representative sample of U.S.

female adolescents, after controlling for selected covari-
ates. Overweight or obese female adolescents in the
study were more likely to be trying to lose weight than
those who were not overweight or obese, a finding that
is consistent with previous studies of U.S. [16,22,27] and
international [20,23] adolescents. In addition, the obese
female adolescents in the current study were signifi-
cantly more likely to be trying to lose weight than those
who were overweight, another finding consistent with
previous research on international adolescents [22].
Because the likeliness of the obese female adolescents in
the present sample to be trying to lose weight was
greater (4.14 times more likely than other female adoles-
cents) than the likeliness of their international counter-
parts (1.95 times more likely) [22], it is plausible that
obese U.S. female adolescents are more likely to be try-
ing to lose weight than obese female adolescents in
other countries.
Results from the current study also demonstrated that
U.S. female adolescents who perceive themselves as
slightly or very overweight are significantly more likely
to be trying to lose weight than are those who do not
perceive themselves as overweight, with no difference in
the likeliness of trying to lose weight between a weight
perception of slightly overweight and very overweight.
This finding is comparable to a previous study of ado-
lescents in Beirut [23] and addresses the lack of studies
considering such an association in a sample of U.S.
female adolescents.
The current study's finding that weight perception has
a stronger association than BMI with trying to lose
weight may raise concerns, because the association
between weight perception and trying to lose weight is
often related to eating disorders. However, such con-
cerns may be assuaged by the finding that overweight or
obese female adolescents with an accurate weight per-
ception are more likely to be trying to lose weight than
those who inaccurately perceive their weight. Further-
more, the study's overweight or obese female adoles-
cents who underestimated their weight (20%) were
significantly less likely to be trying to lose weight than
those who accurately perceived their weight as either

slightly or very overweight. Further studies are needed
to determine the consistency of these findings among
both U.S. and international female adolescents. In addi-
tion, researchers and clinicians who design weight-loss
interventions for female adolescents are encouraged to
consider weight perception accuracy, not just BMI or
weight perception.
Additional studies with longitudinal designs are also
needed to determine the validity of the association
between age and efforts to lose weight among female
adolescents. Results from the current study demon-
strated older female adolescents are more likely than
their younger counterparts to be trying to lose weight, a
finding that is consistent with previous research [22,26].
However, studies have also demonstrated negative [42]
and nonsignificant [25] associations between adoles-
cents' age and efforts to lose weight. Consistent findings
from future research will allow clinicians to identify
whether weight-loss interventions should be aimed at
older, younger, or all female adolescents.
Weight-loss interventions targeted towards or designed
specifically for Black/African American U.S. female ado-
lescents may also be needed. Black/African American
female adolescents in the study had a relatively high pre-
valence of overweight and obesity (38.19%) and a low
prevalence of perceiving themselves as slightly or very
overweight (36.94%). Also, compared to the other race
categories in this study sample, Black/African American
female adolescents who were overweight or obese were
the most likely to inaccurately underestimate their weight
(10.74%), and they were significantly less likely than their
White counterparts to be trying to lose weight.
This study identified significant associations between
BMI, weight perception, and weight perception accuracy
with trying to lose weight. In addition, a relatively large
number of this study's sample reported engaging in exer-
cise as a weight-loss method (n = 796). Thus it is surprising
that these variables were not associated with engaging in
exercise as a weight-loss method. It is possible that female
adolescents may engage in other healthy, unhealthy, or
extreme weight-loss behaviours in addition to or in place
of exercise. Including additional weight-loss behaviours in
this study's regression models may have strengthened the
model, possibly allowing for significant associations. Thus,
additional healthy and unhealthy weight-loss behaviours
are recommended in future research on the associations of
BMI, weight perception, and weight perception accuracy
with engaging in exercise as a weight-loss method among
overweight and obese female adolescents.
Limitations
Use of the Add Health data [30] in this secondary-analy-
sis study limited the statistical analyses of data and the
generalizability of the study's findings. The Add Health
sample was selected from a school-based sample; thus,
findings are only generalizable to U.S. female adoles-
cents enrolled in school. Furthermore, the underlying
survey design of the Add Health study did not allow for
inferences of cause and effect. Although a well-powered
study sample with data from more than 2,000 subjects
was available for analysis, there was a relatively small
number of subjects who were overweight or obese,
which did not allow for separate analyses for overweight
and obese subjects. The weight perception accuracy
variable, therefore, combined subjects who were over-
weight with those who were obese, and statistical analy-
sis was unable to consider differences in weight
perception accuracy between overweight and obese sub-
jects. Also, the conceptualization of weight perception
accuracy and the subjects' interpretation could have
affected their responses, making it difficult to "match"
the BMI categories of overweight and obese with the
weight perception categories of slightly overweight and
very overweight. In terms of validity and reliability,
there was a lack of reported measures, and recom-
mended techniques were not available for this second-
ary-analysis study.
Conclusions
Based on the findings of this secondary analysis of data
from the Add Health study [30], BMI, weight percep-
tion, and weight perception accuracy are significantly
positively associated with the likeliness of trying to lose
weight among U.S. female adolescents. However, BMI,
weight perception, and weight perception accuracy are
not associated with the likeliness of engaging in exercise
as a weight-loss method among U.S. female adolescents;
nevertheless, this finding does not indicate that such
associations do not exist. Considering the strengths and
limitations of this study, results should be interpreted
with a degree of caution. Although this study's results
support findings from previous research regarding ado-
lescents' efforts to lose weight, the current investigation
is the first known study to consider the association of
weight perception accuracy with trying to lose weight
and engaging in exercise as a weight-loss method
among overweight or obese U.S. female adolescents. To
help reduce the national and worldwide epidemic of
overweight and obesity among female adolescents,
weight perception accuracy, as well as age and race,
must be considered as significant factors associated with
weight-loss efforts among female adolescents.
