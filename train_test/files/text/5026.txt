Abstract: One individual's actions may affect the evolutionary fitness of another
individual. Sexually antagonistic coevolution occurs when one partner's behavior decreases
the fitness of the other partner (Rice, 1996). This conflict pressures the other partner to
counter these disadvantageous actions. Mate guarding is a mate retention tactic aimed at
keeping a partner from cheating. Mate guarding may reduce mate choice, especially for
extra pair mates. Therefore, some individuals may resist their partner's mate guarding
tactics. We developed a scale to measure resistance to mate guarding and tested it in
women (N = 1069). Using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), six theoretically sound factors
emerged and explained 69% of the variance. Confirmatory Factor Analysis showed strong
support for the six original subscales as well as for the overall scale. The subscales had
high reliability. The validity of the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale was also excellent.
Women who stated they used more resistance to mate guarding strategies also indicated
that they had partners who mate guarded more, were less invested in their relationships, felt
their partners were more controlling, had a more avoidant attachment style, and had a more
unrestricted sociosexual orientation.

Introduction
Romantic relationships are rife with potential genetic conflicts of interest. One
individual's actions may affect the evolutionary fitness of another individual. Sexually
antagonistic coevolution occurs when one partner's behavior decreases the fitness of the
other partner (Rice, 1996). This conflict pressures the other partner to counter these

disadvantageous actions. Within romantic relationships, mate guarding is one potential area
in which sexually antagonistic coevolution may drive men's and women's behavior. Mate
guarding is a mate retention tactic aimed at keeping a partner from cheating and may
reduce mate choice, especially for extra pair mates. Therefore, some individuals may resist
their partner's mate guarding tactics. We sought to develop a resistance to mate guarding
scale and assess the reliability and validity of the scale.
Mate guarding
According to Buss (2002), mate guarding entails three main strategies: maintaining
access to one's mate, eliminating potential competitors, and preventing a mate from exiting
the relationship. One way to think about mate guarding is that it is the behavioral
manifestation of sexual jealousy; it includes behaviors aimed at controlling a partner's
behavior, such as monopolizing a partner's time, intimidating a partner and potential sexual
competitors, and being vigilant about a partner's whereabouts. Mate guarding includes
directly guarding a partner from rivals along with threats or aggression towards these rivals.
Because only males face paternity uncertainty, most studies of mate guarding (including
those in other species) assume males mate guard their female mates and not vice versa
(e.g., Birkhead, Johnson, and Nettleship, 1985; but for an exception, see Wilson and
Swaddle, 2013).
Although there is evidence to suggest that male mate guarding does, in fact, occur
in humans (Buss and Shackelford, 1997; Flinn, 1988; Haselton and Gangestad, 2006) and
that men respond to the fitness payoffs by mate guarding some women all the time and
other women mostly at high fertility (Haselton and Gangestad, 2006), there is little
evidence pertaining to whether women resist their partner's mate guarding attempts, but
there is evidence that female crustaceans do, in fact, resist mate guarding (Cothran, 2008).
Given the potential evolutionary implications of reduced mate choice, one could argue that
at least some women should resist mate guarding by their male partners.
Very little research exists linking men's mate guarding to women's resistance to
mate guarding. However, one study showed that resistance to mate guarding was highest
for women who cheated on their partner. Interestingly, for women who cheated, resistance
was highest when their partners had higher digit ratios, a marker of reduced prenatal
masculinization (Cousins, Fugère, and Franklin, 2009). Since prenatal testosterone
exposure appears to be related to being threatening and physically aggressive toward a
mate (Cousins et al., 2009), women face costs to resisting their partner's mate guarding
and, therefore, they may resist mate guarding only when the risk of retaliation by their
partner is low.
Controlling partners and resistance to mate guarding
Research indicates that individuals who are more controlling are more violent
toward their romantic partners (Graham-Kevan and Archer, 2005). Other research shows
that proprietary behavior, which is similar to mate guarding, is linked with physical
aggression toward a romantic partner, but for men only (Cousins and Gangestad, 2007).
Since there appears to be a link between mate guarding and resistance to mate guarding, we
expect that women with controlling partners may resist their partner's mate guarding
attempts more than women with less controlling partners. In addition, women themselves
Resistance to mate guarding scale in women
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(1). 2015. -108-
may be controlling in their relationships, and these women may show more resistance to
mate guarding than women with lower levels of controlling behaviors.
Relationship investment and resistance to mate guarding
Recent research on dyadic interactions of romantic partners showed that with
increased investment, couples were more committed (Macher, 2013). Since women's
resistance to mate guarding appears to be at least partly explained by whether they cheated
on their mate (Cousins et al., 2009), one might expect that resistance to mate guarding will
be higher when women are less invested in their relationships.
Intimacy and resistance to mate guarding
Intimacy in romantic relationships is associated with relationship satisfaction. In
research assessing intimacy and conflict across a 10-day time span, researchers found that
intimacy was related to positive affect and that changes in intimacy were a better predictor
of positive affect than just the level of intimacy (Laurenceau, Troy, and Carver, 2005).
These researchers also found that conflict, in particular a change to higher levels of
conflict, is related to more relationship anxiety. Since mate guarding--and women's
resistance to mate guarding--may cause relationship conflict, one might expect that when
there is less intimacy, there will be more resistance to mate guarding.
Attachment style and resistance to mate guarding
Those who have an avoidant attachment style fear intimacy and, therefore,
frequently avoid closeness in relationships (Hazan and Shaver, 1987). Avoidantly attached
individuals are more likely to cheat on a mate and to be less committed to their relationship
(DeWall et al., 2011). Avoidant individuals may be particularly likely to resist the mate
guarding efforts of their mate.
Individuals who have anxious attachment styles fear losing their romantic partners.
This fear may cause them to become very jealous in relationships (Hazan and Shaver,
1987) and to potentially act in ways that are very controlling and, ultimately, destructive to
their relationship (Downey and Feldman, 1996). Although it may seem counter to keeping
their relationship intact, anxiously attached individuals may engage in activities that are
detrimental to their relationship (Downey and Feldman, 1996); one such tactic may be to
mate guard their partner. However, it is unclear whether anxiously attached individuals
should resist mate guarding or actually seek it out (as it may indicate a partner is paying
attention). Therefore, analyses between women's resistance to mate guarding and anxious
attachment are exploratory in nature.
Sociosexual orientation and resistance to mate guarding
Sociosexual Orientation (SOI) is the extent to which an individual is comfortable
having uncommitted sex (Simpson and Gangestad, 1991). Individuals who are unrestricted
feel more comfortable having sex outside of a committed relationship. According to one
study, women's self-reported SOI predicted increased use of some mate retention tactics by
their male partners, including inducing jealousy in a mate, being verbally possessive,
threatening rivals, and being physically aggressive toward rivals (Kardum, Hudek-
Knezevi, and Gracanin, 2006). These behaviors are all related to mate guarding.
Unrestricted individuals are also more likely to report cheating in a relationship (Feldman
Resistance to mate guarding scale in women
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(1). 2015. -109-
and Cauffman, 1999). Therefore, we expect that unrestricted SOI will be related to higher
levels of resistance to mate guarding.
Hypotheses related to the validity of the resistance to mate guarding scale
In recent years, evolutionary psychologists have begun studying the genetic
conflicts of interest that occur in dyadic interactions. Conflicts of interest occur when the
best strategy for one partner does not match the best strategy for the other partner (Trivers,
1972). In order to move forward in understanding the benefits and drawbacks of men's
mate guarding, as well as women's strategies toward a partner who uses mate guarding, it
is important to have a measure of women's resistance to mate guarding. No instruments
currently exist to measure resistance to mate guarding. The goal of the current study was to
assess the reliability and validity of a newly developed Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale.
The following hypotheses were tested:
1. Women with partners who mate guard more often will resist the mate guarding
attempts of their partners more.
2. Women who say their partners are more controlling will show more resistance to
mate guarding.
3. Women who self-report that they are more controlling will show more resistance
to mate guarding than women with lower levels of controlling behaviors.
4. Individuals who show higher levels of resistance to mate guarding will show less
investment in their relationships.
5. Individuals with higher levels of resistance to mate guarding will report less
intimacy in their romantic relationships.
6. Resistance to mate guarding will be positively correlated with avoidant
attachment styles. Analyses with anxious attachment are exploratory.
7. Individuals who show higher levels of resistance to mate guarding will have a
more unrestricted sociosexual orientation.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Heterosexual women were recruited both online (n = 976) and through a small,
public liberal arts university (n = 93) for a study about conflict in romantic relationships (N
= 1069). Some of the students from our university participated in the online version, but
most of the participants from the online sample were recruited from outside of the
university. Participants had a mean age of 21.88 years (SD = 6.37). Sixty-seven percent
were Caucasian, 11.5% were African American, 8.6% were Hispanic, 8.8% were from
other racial or ethnic backgrounds, and 3.9% did not respond. Of the women in the sample,
34% were single, 50.3% were dating someone, 4.2% were engaged, 8% were married, and
3.5% did not answer the question. For those in a current romantic relationship, the average
length of their relationship was more than two years (M = 27.57 months, SD = 41.42). The
median relationship length was 16 months, indicating that most of the participants were
currently in relatively long term, stable relationships.

Measures
Participants were asked to think about their current relationship or their last
relationship (if they were not currently involved) while they completed a variety of
questionnaires. The following measures were used:
Mate guarding. The Mate Guarding Scale consists of 48 items that assess how
frequently women's partners have used a variety of mate guarding tactics (Cousins, 2003).
Some items were drawn from the Mate Retention Tactics Scale (Buss, 1988), but we also
generated original items (see Cousins, 2003 for more details about the development of the
Mate Guarding Scale). For example, we included the items Buss (1988) categorized as
"direct guarding" (p. 298). Direct guarding consisted of vigilance, mate concealment, and
time monopolization. We also considered the tactics of punishing a mate's threat of
infidelity, intrasexual threats, and intrasexual violence to be part of the repertoire of mate
guarding tactics. We did not include some other aspects from the Mate Retention Tactics
Scale in our measure of mate guarding--for instance, changing appearance to keep a mate
(Buss, 1988).
Participants were asked to rate how often their partner "used social networks to
show other people that they were in a relationship" and how frequently their partner
confronted someone making a pass at them. The scale ranges from 0 (never) to 4 (very
often) where higher scores indicate more mate guarding. The participants also completed
the same questionnaire with regard to their own mate guarding behaviors. Cronbach's
alphas were extremely reliable at .95 for women's self-ratings and .96 for their rating of
their partner's mate guarding.
Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale. To determine whether women resist mate
guarding by their partner, we developed a measure to assess resistance to mate guarding.
Further details regarding scale development are described below. Women reported how
frequently they used a variety of tactics to resist mate guarding attempts by their partner.
The measure consists of 34 items rated on a 5-point scale (0 = "never," 4 = "very often")
where higher scores indicate more resistance to mate guarding. Sample items include: "I
avoided situations where I knew my partner might be able to check up on me" and "I
stopped talking to other men because it caused too much conflict in our relationship."
Relationship investment. Relationship investment was measured using the Partner
Specific Investment Inventory (Ellis, 1998). It includes 52 items such as "I make and
discuss plans for our future" and "I desert my partner at parties." Higher scores indicate
higher levels of investment in the relationship and questions tap into various types of
investment, including being nurturing, oriented toward the future, spending time together,
and being socially attentive. We calculated a mean Relationship Investment score for all 52
items. Cronbach's alpha for the overall Partner Specific Investment Inventory was .97 (see
Ellis [1998] for a more detailed discussion of reliability and validity for this scale).
Controlling Behavior Scale. This scale measures five different types of control,
including economic control ("I controlled my partner's money"), threatening control ("I
threatened to harm my partner"), intimidating control ("I tried to make my partner do
things my partner didn't want to"), emotional control ("I told my partner he was going
mad"), and isolating control ("I checked up on my partner's movements") (Graham-Kevan
and Archer, 2005). Twenty-four items were rated from 0 (never) to 4 (always). Participants
completed both self-reports of controlling behavior as well as reporting on the degree of
controlling behaviors by their partner. A mean score was calculated for all the items in the
Resistance to mate guarding scale in women
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(1). 2015. -111-
scale. Cronbach's alphas were highly reliable at .94 for self-report and .96 for partner-
report.
Intimacy Scale. The Intimacy Scale measures intimacy within close relationships
and includes various aspects of intimacy such as emotional closeness, respect, and
solidarity (Walker and Thompson, 1983). This is a 17-item measure with a 7-point Likert
scale (0 = "never," 6 = "always") where higher scores indicate great levels of intimacy.
Sample items include: "I feel like we are a unit" and "We respect each other." We
calculated a mean score for intimacy. Cronbach's alpha was .97.
The Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised Questionnaire. This scale
measures how comfortable individuals are getting close to others (attachment avoidance)
and how secure they are in relationships (attachment anxiety) (Fraley, Waller, and Brennan,
2000). Each subscale had 18 items measured on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree)
Likert scale, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of avoidance and anxiety in
relationships. Cronbach's alphas were excellent at .94 for both the anxiety and avoidance
subscales.
Sociosexual Orientation Inventory. To assess how comfortable women were
engaging in uncommitted sex, we used the Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI;
Simpson and Gangestad, 1991). This scale consists of seven items, including questions
asking participants how many partners they had sexual intercourse with in the past year,
how frequently they fantasized about someone other than their primary partner, how many
partners they had sexual intercourse with on only one occasion, and their attitudes toward
uncommitted sex. SOI scores were calculated as described in Simpson and Gangestad
(1991). Higher scores indicate a more unrestricted sociosexual orientation (i.e., they were
more comfortable having uncommitted sex). Cronbach's alpha was .83 (Simpson and
Gangestad, 1991).
Procedure
We used the Mate Guarding Scale (Cousins, 2003) to generate ideas about how men
mate guard women. We then generated various strategies women might use to resist their
partner's mate guarding attempts. For instance, one item from the Mate Guarding Scale
was, "My partner confronted someone he thought was hitting on me." One of the
Resistance to Mate Guarding items that we created matched this mate guarding item: "I
was sneaky about flirting with other men so my partner wouldn't find out." In addition to
the authors creating items for theoretical reasons, a small group of research assistants
thought of ways in which women might resist the mate guarding attempts of their partner.
Most of the additional items included the use of technology to resist mate guarding. For
instance, the following item was suggested by a research assistant: "I ignore text
messages/phone calls I receive from my partner throughout the day." Unlike some scale
development (e.g., Buss, 1988), we did not have participants generate items. Instead, we
generated items based on a theoretical approach using known mate guarding tactics to
generate ideas about how women might resist mate guarding.
After developing the items for the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale, we received
approval from the Committee for the Use of Human Subjects and then we recruited women
from our university as well as from an online research website. All but 93 of the women
completed the questionnaire online after consenting to participate in the study. The other 93
Resistance to mate guarding scale in women

women completed a copy of the questionnaire in person. Upon completion, participants
were debriefed.
Results
Differences between the online and on-ground participants
We conducted independent sample t-tests to investigate potential differences
between the samples recruited online versus on-ground. Online participants were
significantly older (M = 22.04, SD = 6.54) than on-ground participants (M = 20.23, SD =
3.96), t(1007) = -2.61, p = .01. However, the difference in the lengths of their current
romantic relationships was only marginally significant, t(1020) = -1.83, p = .07.
Importantly, women recruited online versus on-ground did not significantly differ in their
responses to any of the subscales of the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale, nor did they
differ in the amount of mate guarding they reported by their partners. Therefore, we
combined these groups for the subsequent factor analyses.
Factor analysis of the resistance to mate guarding scale
We randomly split the sample and conducted an exploratory factor analysis on half
of the data (n = 539) and a confirmatory factor analysis on half of the data (n = 569).
Exploratory factor analysis. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis on the
Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale using principal axis factoring with oblique rotation. Six
factors emerged, which explained 69.43% of the variance. As shown in Table 1, the six
rotated factors had very balanced loadings.

All of the items on the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale, along with the factor
loadings from the rotated pattern matrix, are shown in Tables 2 to 7. Factor loadings for an
item indicate how well each item correlates with the factor (Tabachnick and Fidell, 1996).
Factor loadings below .20 are not shown in the Tables. The scree plot indicated six factors,
and after assessing the individual items, we concluded that extracting six factors was
appropriate and theoretically sound. The six factors on the Resistance to Mate Guarding
Scale were: Covert Tactics (see Table 2), Resisting a Partner's Public Displays of Affection
(PDA; see Table 3), Reactions against Rival Confrontation by a partner (see Table 4), use
of High Tech Covert Strategies (see Table 5), Avoiding Contact with a Partner (see Table
6), and Resisting a Partner's Attempts at Control (see Table 7).

Confirmatory factor analysis of the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale
Based upon the results of the exploratory factor analysis, there appeared to be some
potentially problematic cross-loadings for six items (meeting the definition based upon a
difference between maximum loadings of < .10). Three items (item 13 of the Covert scale
and Items 12 and 22 of the Avoiding Partner Contact scale) had nearly identical pattern
matrix factor loadings (within .03 on two subscales). These three items were removed prior
to the confirmatory factor analysis.
A second-order confirmatory factor analysis with maximum likelihood estimation
was conducted using EQS 6 to test the hypothesized 6-factor model for the Resistance to
Mate Guarding Scale. The six proposed latent constructs (i.e., first order factors) included
Covert Tactics, Resistance to PDA, Resisting Control, Reactions against Rival, High Tech
Covert Strategies, and Avoiding Partner's Contact. The model also included a seventh,
second-order factor to represent overall resistance to mate guarding. The assumption of
multivariate normality was violated; therefore, we used robust maximum likelihood
estimation. The Satorra-Bentler Scaled 2 and robust estimates of the Comparative Fit
Index (CFI), Root Mean-Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and normed chi-square
test (i.e., 2 divided by degrees of freedom) were used to interpret model fit. A CFI value
greater than or equal to .90, RMSEA value less than .05, and normed 2 value close to or
less than 2 indicate a model of favorable fit (Hatcher, 2004; Kline, 2005).
All fit indices revealed that the hypothesized model is a good fit for the data
(Satorra-Bentler 2[423] = 647.51; CFI = .90; RMSEA = .04; normed 2 = 1.53). Based on
the Lagrange Multiplier Test, five error covariances were allowed to relax the model. The
Wald Test indicated that none of the measurement parameters needed to be dropped. All
tested path coefficients were statistically significant. Moreover, all path coefficients from
the second- to the first-order factors were large (ranging from .59 to .90), and none of the
first-order factor-to-item coefficients fell below .55. This indicates that it is appropriate to
use the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale with either six subscales or as one overall
measure of resistance to mate guarding. The proposed CFA model with standardized
pathway coefficients is shown in Figure 1.
Cronbach's alphas and correlation of subscales
We calculated Cronbach's alphas for each subscale using the entire data set. The
reliabilities ranged from .86 to .93. The reliability for the subscale Covert Tactics was .90.
Covert Tactics consisted of nine items that encompassed the ways women may try to resist
mate guarding which they do not want their partner to discover. For example, "I hid stuff
from my partner, so he wouldn't find it." Resistance to PDA had a reliability of .93 and
consisted of three items. These items included behaviors aimed at trying to hinder a
partner's attempt at being demonstrative in public. For example, "I wouldn't let my partner
put his arm around me in public." Resisting Control was the third subscale, with a
reliability of .89. This subscale consisted of seven items that tapped into the things women
did to stop a partner's controlling behavior. For instance, "I fought with my partner because
he didn't give me enough independence." The Reactions against Rival Confrontation by a
Partner had a Cronbach's alpha of .86 and included four items. This scale tapped into the
ways women resisted their partner's attempt to confront possible mate poachers. For
instance, "I was angry because my partner yelled at other people who looked at me." High
Tech Covert Strategies had an alpha of .87 and included five items that assessed using
Resistance to mate guarding scale in women

technology to avoid a partner's mate guarding attempts. For example, "I have erased
messages/comments other people have made to me via computer (i.e. Facebook, Myspace,
AOL instant messenger, e-mail) so my partner does not find them." The final subscale was
Avoiding Partner's Contact; this scale had a reliability of .87 and consisted of five items.
These items reflected the ways in which women escape being in contact with their partner.
For instance, "I pretend that I do not receive all text messages/phone calls from my partner
to avoid fighting with him/her."
Finally, we conducted correlations using the full sample to determine if the
subscales were related. Not surprisingly, they were all significantly, positively correlated
with each other. Correlations ranged from .36 to .70 (see Table 8).

Testing the validity of the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale
Once we established that the structure of the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale
was sound, we began testing the validity of the scale using the entire sample. We used a
more stringent alpha (p  .01) to decrease the probability of a Type I error that may occur
due to the number of analyses we performed.
Mate guarding and women's resistance to mate guarding. We predicted that
women who indicated that their partners used more mate guarding tactics would have
higher levels of resistance to mate guarding. Each subscale of the Resistance to Mate
Guarding Scale significantly and positively correlated with women's self-reports of their
partner's mate guarding. The highest correlation indicated that women with partners who
used more mate guarding tactics were more likely to resist their partner's attempts to
control them (see Table 9).

Controlling partners and women's resistance to mate guarding. We predicted that
women who rated their partners as more controlling (as measured by the Controlling
Behavior Scale) would show more resistance to their partner's mate guarding attempts.
Each subscale of the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale significantly and positively
correlated with women's ratings of their partner's controlling behaviors. Not surprisingly,
the highest correlation showed that women who rated their partners as more controlling
used more covert resistance behaviors (see Table 9).
Women's use of control and their resistance to mate guarding. We predicted that
women who self-reported high levels of control of their partner would also be more likely
to resist their partner's mate guarding, primarily because these women clearly preferred to
be in control and be independent of their partners. Each subscale of the Resistance to Mate
Guarding Scale significantly and positively correlated with women's ratings of their own
controlling behavior. Interestingly, women's use of controlling behaviors had the highest
correlations with covert resistance to mate guarding strategies (see Table 9).
Women's relationship investment and resistance to mate guarding. We predicted
that each subscale of the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale would be related to less
relationship investment as measured by the Partner Specific Investment Inventory. Once
again, each subscale of the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale significantly and negatively
predicted women's self-reported investment in their romantic relationship. The strongest
correlation indicated that the less invested women were in their relationship, the more they
avoided their partner's contact (see Table 9).
Intimacy and resistance to mate guarding. We predicted that resistance to mate
guarding would be higher in women who rated their relationships as less intimate. Each
subscale of the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale significantly and negatively correlated
Resistance to mate guarding scale in women
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(1). 2015. -121-
with women's ratings of intimacy. The two strongest correlations indicated that women
who resisted their partner's control and avoided their partner's contact felt their
relationships were less intimate (see Table 9).
Women's attachment style and resistance to mate guarding. We predicted that
attachment style would be correlated with the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale. In
particular, we predicted that women with avoidant attachment would show more resistance
to mate guarding. Once again, each subscale was significantly correlated with both anxious
and avoidant attachment. However, the correlation between Resistance to a Partner's Public
Displays of Affection and anxious attachment was so small that it is unlikely to be
meaningful (r = .10). Women with anxious attachment styles were likely to resist their
partner's mate guarding tactics using covert methods. Avoidant attachment was most
strongly correlated with three resistance strategies: use of covert tactics, avoiding public
displays of affection, and resisting a partner's control (see Table 9).
SOI and resistance to mate guarding. We predicted that women with a more
unrestricted sociosexual orientation would have higher levels of resistance to mate
guarding. As expected, all of the resistance to mate guarding subscales significantly and
positively correlated with sociosexual orientation. However, these correlations were fairly
low, ranging from .13 to .24. The highest correlation indicated that more unrestricted
women used more covert resistance to mate guarding strategies (see Table 9).
Discussion
Based on theoretical and empirical support, we determined that the Resistance to
Mate Guarding Scale has six factors, including resistance to mate guarding via Covert
Tactics, resisting a partner's Public Displays of Affection, resisting a partner's attempts at
Control, Reaction Against Rival Confrontation by a partner, use of High Tech Covert
Strategies, and Avoiding Contact with a partner. These factors account for over 60% of the
variance. Each of these subscales had high reliability and, not surprisingly, all of the
subscales were significantly correlated with one another. Analyses also supported the use
of an overall measure of resistance to mate guarding. Thus, researchers may choose to use
an overall measure of resistance to mate guarding or the six subscales.
In addition to analyzing the structure and reliability of the Resistance to Mate
Guarding Scale, we conducted further analyses to assess the validity of the questionnaire.
As expected, compared to the other instruments we used to assess the validity of the
Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale, mate guarding and resistance to mate guarding showed
the largest correlations. This suggests that resistance to mate guarding occurs when women
perceive that their partners are mate guarding and being controlling. Even when mate
guarding occurs, resistance is most likely under specific circumstances, such as when
women know their partners will not discover their resistance or when the stakes are low,
such as with a partner who will not retaliate through the use of violence. Research assessing
men's use of mate guarding and women's resistance to mate guarding indicates that women
are more likely to resist mate guarding when their partner has a higher digit ratio, which is
an indication of reduced prenatal exposure to testosterone. Since men with lower digit
ratios are more likely to espouse the use of threats and physical violence toward a partner,
women may not be willing to risk resisting the mate guarding attempts of these partners
(Cousins et al., 2009).
Resistance to mate guarding scale in women
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(1). 2015. -122-
In further support of the validity of the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale,
women's self-reported controlling behaviors positively predicted resistance to mate
guarding, as did their report of their partner's controlling behaviors. Previous research
indicates that control and intimate partner violence are related (Graham-Kevan and Archer,
2005), at least in men (Cousins and Gangestad, 2007). Our research extends these findings:
When male partners are controlling, their female mates are more resistant to mate guarding.
Presumably, this is because more controlling men are more likely to mate guard their
partners, which women then resist. In addition, our research indicates that when women see
themselves as particularly controlling, they are more likely to resist their partner's mate
guarding attempts. There are a few possible explanations for this finding. These women
may be more interested in independence within their relationship. Alternatively, these
women may be in highly antagonistic relationships where both partners try to induce
jealousy and react to the jealousy of their partners. Future research should investigate these
possibilities.
Relationship investment and intimacy were negatively correlated with resistance to
mate guarding. When women are less invested in their relationships, they may focus more
on seeking an alternative mate. These women should be particularly likely to be mate
guarded by their partners and to be motivated to resist those mate guarding attempts. When
intimacy is low, women may be resistant to the mate guarding tactics of their partner
because they are dissatisfied with their relationships.
Those with anxious and avoidant attachment also used more resistance to mate
guarding tactics, although anxious attachment had a very low correlation with resistance to
a partner's PDA (r = .10). We predicted that those with avoidant attachment would be more
likely to resist mate guarding because women with an avoidant attachment style tend to be
less committed to their relationships (DeWall et al., 2011). It is not clear how to interpret
the finding that women with more anxious attachment styles more strongly resisted mate
guarding. This correlation is very low and may represent a spurious relationship.
Finally, there were small but statistically significant correlations between
sociosexual orientation and resistance to mate guarding such that more unrestricted women
used more resistance strategies. This may be due to the fact that unrestricted women are
more likely to cheat on a partner (Feldman and Cauffman, 1999); prior research shows that
women who are interested in men other than their partners are more likely to resist mate
guarding (Cousins et al., 2009). In sum, our results support both the convergent validity of
the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale.
Limitations and future directions
One of the limitations of this research is that only women were assessed.
Evolutionary theory clearly predicts that men mate guard their partners, but its predictions
for women's mate guarding are less straightforward. Buss (2002) argued that it makes
sense for women to mate guard a partner because loss of resources to a competitor would
have had detrimental fitness effects for a woman whose partner cheated on her. As with
women's use of aggression, we suspect that even when women mate guard their partners,
they are using some of the tactics that have a lower risk of physical injury (i.e., they avoid
physical fights) (Campbell, 2005). The fitness payoffs to women are lower for tactics that
could result in physical injury because women were more important in the survival of their
offspring (Campbell, 2005). Research bears this out: In married couples, husbands,
Resistance to mate guarding scale in women
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(1). 2015. -123-
compared to their wives, report greater use of tactics that may risk injury such as
threatening competitors (Buss and Shackelford, 1997). Many of the behaviors we consider
to be mate guarding may have led to injury (Campbell, 2005). For instance, confronting a
rival may lead to a physical assault and, therefore, women may be less likely to employ this
method of mate guarding.
If women also use mate guarding to control their partners, this scale may not
capture men's resistance strategies as well as it does women's resistance strategies. As with
mate retention tactics, we expect that men may resist their partner's mate guarding in ways
that are more confrontational, especially regarding physical confrontations. Many of the
items on the current scale reflect the covert nature of the tactics used by women to resist
their partner's mate guarding attempts (e.g., "I always erase text messages/voicemails from
other people so my partner does not find out who I have been conversing with that day"). In
fact, in previous research we divided this scale into the behaviors men would be aware of
and those for which men would not be aware of (Cousins, 2003). Future research should
include an analysis of whether resistance to mate guarding occurs in men and whether they
use the same tactics as women.
It is possible that our resistance scale is tapping into a more general strategy in
women who dislike behavioral restriction. That is, some women may score higher on the
resistance to mate guarding scale simply because they dislike any sort of behavioral
restriction. However, previous research using an earlier, unpublished version of this scale
indicates that women are more likely to resist mate guarding when they are fertile,
particularly for women who are attracted to men other than their primary partners
(Gangestad, Garver-Apgar, Cousins, and Thornhill, 2014). The fact that women's scores
vary across the menstrual cycle strongly suggests that the Resistance to Mate Guarding
Scale does not measure a general form of behavioral restriction, but taps directly into
women's behavioral response to their partner's attempts to keep them from cheating.
Although we believe this is strong evidence that the Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale is
not measuring psychological reactance, future research should address this issue more
directly. The current research strongly supports the convergent validity of the Resistance to
Mate Guarding Scale. However, future research should assess the discriminant validity of
the measure.
Conclusions
Our research extends Buss' (1988) research on mate retention by assessing the
dynamics that occur between partners when mate guarding is present in the relationship. By
assessing dynamics within romantic relationships, especially regarding conflict over mate
retention strategies, a better understanding of the interaction between partners will emerge.
This will add to the growing body of research seeking to understand the coevolution of
strategies when partners are in conflict.
The Resistance to Mate Guarding Scale may elucidate individual differences in
reactions to a partner's mate guarding. We expect that scores on this scale will be predicted
by a variety of factors, including interest in extra-pair partners and cheating. The resistance
to Mate Guarding Scale adds to a growing body of research assessing sexually antagonistic
coevolution in humans. In the past few years, research on sexually antagonistic coevolution
has grown in importance. Recent work by McKibbin, Shackelford, Miner, Bates, and
Liddle (2011) highlights the importance of research concerning sexually antagonistic
Resistance to mate guarding scale in women

coevolution. To our knowledge, this study is the first to develop a scale measuring
strategies to reduce mate guarding.
