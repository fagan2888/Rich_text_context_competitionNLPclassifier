Cyberbullying in College: Frequency,
Characteristics, and Practical Implications
Carlos P. Zalaquett1 and SeriaShia J. Chatters2
Abstract
Cyberbullying is commonly presented as affecting K-12 populations. Current research suggests cyberbullying continues in
college. A diverse sample of 613 university students was surveyed to study their cyberbullying experiences in high school
and college. Nineteen percent of the sample reported being a victim of cyberbullying in college and 35% of this subsample
reported being cyberbullied in high school. Additional findings and practical implications are presented.
Keywords
cyberbullying, college, undergraduates, bullying
Cyberbullying has been extensively studied among pre-
adolescent and adolescent populations in secondary
education (Berson, Berson, & Ferron, 2002; Smith & Yoon,
2013; Ybarra & Mitchell, 2004a, 2004b). The occurrence
and characteristics of this phenomenon among college
student populations are largely unknown (Smith & Yoon,
2013; Ybarra & Mitchell, 2007).
Cyberbullying victimization online has gradually
become a focus of concern due to reported incidents of
suicide linked to bullying online (El-Ghobashy, 2010;
Schwartz, 2010), the White House Summit on Bullying's
concerns about cyberbullying in college (White House,
2011), and recent publications reporting college students
being targets of online smear campaigns that included
racist, sexist, homophobic remarks, or threats of physical
violence (Gilroy, 2013).
High school and college students continue to be the
population that utilizes the Internet and social media most
often including email, cell phones, instant messaging, and
chat rooms (Boyd, 2008; Bryant, Sanders-Jackson, &
Smallwood, 2006; Palfrey & Gasser, 2008). Recent studies
indicate that 83% of adults 18 to 29 use the Internet while
attending college and 90% reported being members of
social media websites (Duggan & Brenner, 2013; Lampe,
Ellison, & Steinfield, 2006). This extensive use of
technology and social outlets provides useful media for
bullying to take place (Gilroy, 2013; Mishna, Cook,
Gadalla, Daciuk, & Solomon, 2010).
Despite national attention, reported cases, and access
to media, there has been minimal research on
cyberbullying among college students. A recent search
conducted by the authors using Academic Search
Premier, JSTOR, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, and Web of
Science found very few studies regarding cyberbullying
in college. Furthermore, these studies provided no
implications for college counselors preparing for,
responding to, or providing education on the topic of
cyberbullying in post-secondary settings. In addition,
there were no studies on the continuation of
cyberbullying from high school to college.
Cyberbullying
Due to the recency of cyberbullying, there is a lack of
consensus about definition of terms (Kowalski, Limber, &
Agatston, 2008). Indeed, the need for an integrative
definition of cyberbullying is crucial for both conceptual
and operational clarity. For the purposes of this study, the
following definitions were used: Cyberbullying is any
behavior performed through electronic or digital media by
individuals or groups who repeatedly communicate hostile
or aggressive messages intended to inflict harm or
discomfort on others (Smith et al., 2008; Tokunaga, 2010).
A cyberbully is a person who uses electronic means to
intentionally harass others. A victim of cyberbullying is a
person who has experienced harassment or threats through
electronic means (Hinduja & Patchin, 2008).
Cyberbullying manifests through four primary forms:
chat rooms, instant messaging, emails, and text messaging
(Diamanduros, Downs, & Jenkins, 2008; Finn, 2004;
Raskauskas & Stoltz, 2007; Smith et al., 2008; Willard,
2004). Lack of supervision and the anonymity provided by
these electronic forms makes it easy to be both a cyberbully
and a victim (Diamanduros et al., 2008).

Cyberbullying Among College Populations
Cyberbullying among K-12 populations has been reported
as ranging from 9% to 42% (Kowalski & Limber, 2007; Li,
2007). There are a variety of research studies conducted on
cyberbullying that focus on K-12 student populations,
focused primarily on pre-adolescents and adolescents
(Juvonen & Gross, 2008; Li, 2007). These studies
demonstrated a decrease in bullying overall from
elementary to secondary school, a finding that suggest
further decreases in bullying from secondary school to
college. One of the few studies reviewing the frequency,
characteristics, and psychological effects of cyberbullying
on college populations found a positive correlation between
being a bully in elementary school, high school, and college
(Chapell et al., 2006). Chapell et al. (2006) reported that
more than 40% of participants who reported being either
bullies or victims of bullies in elementary school and high
school, continued to maintain this role in college. In
addition, research regarding bullying in the workplace
found that adults who had been bullies in childhood had the
potential to be bullies in the workplace as well (Harvey,
Heames, Richey, & Leonard, 2006). These findings suggest
some stability of the bullying role and its presence in
adulthood.
According to the few research studies available to date,
the prevalence of cyberbullying among college populations
ranges from 10% (Smith & Yoon, 2013) to 28.7% (Hinduja
& Patchin, 2010). Finn (2004) found that 10% to 15% of
the 339 college students surveyed reported experiencing
cyberbullying via instant messaging. The study did not
explore diversity of the sample. A study conducted in
Turkey by Dilmac (2009) surveyed 666 university students
and found that about 22% reported experiencing
cyberbullying. This study highlighted the prevalence of
cyberbullying in college on an international level. Zacchilli
and Valerio (2011) conducted two studies on college
students. Study 1 surveyed 1,272 freshmen and Study 2
surveyed 76 freshmen and 34 seniors. The results of Study
1 indicated that less than 1% of the students reported
experiencing cyberbullying. In Study 2, about 9% of the
sample reported being a victim of cyberbullying, whereas
3.6% reported being a cyberbully. MacDonald and Roberts-
Pittman (2010) surveyed 439 college students and found
that 21% of the sample reported being cyberbullied, 38%
reported knowing someone who had been cyberbullied, and
8% reported cyberbullying someone. Reported frequencies
of cyberbullying were partitioned from the overall data set
focused on traditional bullying behaviors. Walker,
Sockman, and Koehn (2011) found that 11% of college
students surveyed had experienced cyberbullying with more
than 40% knowing someone who had been cyberbullied.
Finally, a recent study by Smith and Yoon (2013)
summarized the findings from 276 responses out of 16,986
randomly chosen emails. About 10% of the respondents
reported being cyberbullied in college and 25% reported
observing another student being cyberbullied. The small
number of returned responses limited the significance of
this study.
The variations in sample size, methodologies, and
findings among the limited research available suggests a
need for additional studies reporting on the frequency and
characteristics of cyberbullying among college students
(Lindsay & Krysik, 2012; Molluzzo & Lawler, 2012;
Schenk & Fremouw, 2012).
Emotional and Psychological Impact of Cyberbullying
The psychological effects of cyberbullying seem to cause
equal or more emotional damage than traditional bullying
due to the wider audience and impact of the Internet
(Gilroy, 2013). A meta-analysis of 33 studies conducted by
Nakamoto and Schwartz (2009) revealed a significant
negative association between peer victimization and
academic achievement in high school students, as measured
by grades, student achievement scores, or teacher ratings of
academic achievement. Additional studies indicate that
bullied and cyberbullied children and adolescents more
frequently than their peers want to avoid attending school,
have issues with substance abuse, delinquency, depression,
and receive poorer grades similar to their cyberbully-victim
peers (Eisenberg, Neumark-Sztainer, & Perry, 2003;
Kowalski & Limber, 2013; Mitchell, Ybarra, & Finkelhor,
2007; Ybarra, Espelage, & Mitchell, 2007; Ybarra &
Mitchell, 2007).
Gender, Ethnicity, and Cyberbullying
Research has found a lack of consensus regarding gender
differences in cyberbullying victimization in middle and
high school. Some studies reported an equal amount of
cyberbullying experienced by males and females (Hinduja
& Patchin, 2008; Li, 2006; 2007). Other studies found
girls more likely to be victims of cyberbullying, whereas a
Turkish study found boys to be the victims of
cyberbullying more often (Aricak et al., 2008; Smith et al.,
2008; Vandebosch & Van Cleemput, 2008; Wang,
Iannotti, & Nansel, 2009). Similarly, there are
controversial findings regarding gender differences for the
bully (Li, 2007; Slonje & Smith, 2008). The impact of
ethnicity on cyberbullying experiences of victims and
bullies were also found to be contradictory. A survey
study on a college sample found that 60% of victims and
70% of bullies were White (Li, 2007). An intercultural
study comparing Chinese and Canadian students found the
former reported higher instances of being the victims of
cyberbullying while the latter reported more instances of
being the perpetrator of cyberbullying (Li, 2008). In spite
of their limitations and variations in outcome, these
studies identified the presence of cyberbullying in college
and denoted a need for further research.

The Present Study
The purpose of this study is to contribute to the current
knowledge base by investigating the prevalence of
cyberbullying in a large sample of college students from
diverse backgrounds and to determine the relationship
between cyberbullying in high school and college. Given
the potential presence and impact of cyberbullying, the
exploration of students' attitudes toward cyberbullying
prevention training was included. The study addressed the
following research questions:
Research Question 1: To what extent do college
students experience cyberbullying?
Research Question 2: To what extent were victims of
cyberbullying during high school also victims during
college?
Research Question 3: To what extent were victims also
bullies?
Research Question 4: Are there differences in the
frequency of cyberbullying based on gender, age, race
and ethnicity, and frequency of time on electronic
mediums?
Research Question 5: Via which mediums did
cyberbullying occur the most and by who?
Research Question 6: What are the direct psychological
effects and actions taken following cyberbullying?
Research Question 7: To what extent would college
students favor education on cyberbullying?
Method
Context and Participants
Similar to other studies, this research used survey data from
a convenience sample of university students from a large,
urban, southeastern university (Hustinx, Meijs, Handy, &
Cnaan, 2012; Lindsay & Krysik, 2012). The study,
approved by the university's Institutional Review Board,
included only students who were currently enrolled.
Participants included 613 college students. A total of 604
completed surveys out of 613 were used in the study.
Demographics of the respondents were as follows: 459
females and 149 males (5 did not report gender); 56% (n =
338) European American, 10% (n = 60) African American,
14% (n = 85) Hispanic, and 18% (n = 109) Asian and Other
(6 did not report their ethnicity); between the ages of 21 and
59 with the age categories being 21 to 24 (60%), 25 to 29
(27%), and 30 and older (11%).
Research Procedures
Surveys were distributed in seven undergraduate courses
accepted by most colleges' programs as part of their general
curriculum. After receiving consent from each instructor, a
member of the research team visited each classroom, read
the participant's informed consent form, and distributed the
surveys. The surveys were distributed at the beginning of
each class included a copy of the informed consent form.
Students were informed that participation in the study was
optional and anonymous. Participants did not receive any
rewards for participation in the study. Research team
members did not report any incidences of participants
declining to participate, thus reducing the possibility of
respondent self-selection (Hustinx et al., 2012). Completed
surveys were collected for data analysis.
Measures
The College Cyberbullying Survey consisted of 23
questions developed for the purposes of this study. Two
senior faculty experts in adolescent behavior in schools and
college reviewed and approved the questionnaire. The
survey was separated into two sections including
demographic information and questions regarding
cyberbullying experiences. The following independent
variables were included in the first section of the
questionnaire to explain possible differences in
cyberbullying experiences: gender, ethnicity, grade point
average, membership to social networks, and chat room use.
Section 2 of the questionnaire consisted of 14 questions that
inquired about cyberbullying experiences such as number of
times cyberbullying was experienced in high school,
number of times cyberbullying was experienced in college,
source of cyberbullying, whether they participated in
cyberbullying, and the electronic mediums used by
cyberbullies to harass victims. Individuals interested in
obtaining a copy of the survey may contact the authors.
Analysis
A series of Pearson's chi-square tests were used to analyze
the data. This statistics was used due to the nominal nature
of the data and to investigate any possible relationships
among the variables. Lebanon (2009) indicates, "Pearson's
Chi-Square is generally considered the standard method for
the multinomial case and is often more accurate than the
alternatives" (p. 1).
Results
After an analysis of the data regarding each research
question, some relations were determined and are indicated
below.
Research Question 1: To What Extent Do College
Students Experience Cyberbullying?
Analysis of the data collected indicated that 31.3% (n =
189) of the respondents were victims of cyberbullying
during high school and 19% (n = 115) were victims during
4 SAGE Open
college. Cyberbullying experiences of college students
ranged from 0 to 10+ times during high school with 24% (n
= 145) reporting being bullied 1 to 3 times; 4% (n = 25), 4
to 6 times; and 2% (n = 13), 7 to 10+ times. Cyberbullying
experiences of the college students currently ranged from 0
to 10+ times with 14% (n = 85) reporting being bullied 1 to
3 times; 2.6% (n = 18), 4 to 6 times; and 2% (n = 12), 7 to
10+ times. In addition, 28% of these participants reported
having a friend who had currently experienced
cyberbullying. These results indicate a significant number
of college students who have been affected directly by
cyberbullying or know someone who has.
Of the 19% of college cyberbully victims, 30% reported
that the reported cyberbullying was based on sexuality, 10%
reported it was based on race/ethnicity, 8% reported it was
based on gender, and 62% placed the type of cyberbullying
that took place under the "Other" category.
Research Question 2: To What Extent Were Victims
of Cyberbullying During High School Also Victims
During College?
A statistically significant association was found between
cyberbullying in high school and cyberbullying in college
(2 = 132.46, p < .0001) with approximately 35% (n = 93)
of the victims of cyberbullying in college also experiencing
cyberbullying in high school, which accounted for
approximately 15% of the total sample.
Research Question 3: To What Extent Were Victims
of Cyberbullying Also Cyberbullies?
Approximately 5% (n = 33) of the total sample reported
being a cyberbully in college and 40% of this subsample
reported being victims of cyberbullying as well.
Approximately 3% of the subsample of participants who
reported being victims of cyberbullying in college reported
being cyberbullies as well.
Research Question 4: Are There Differences in the
Frequency of Cyberbullying Based on Gender, Age,
Ethnicity, and Frequency of Time on Electronic
Mediums?
Gender. Cyberbullying in college differed by gender, 15.5% of
the females surveyed reported being cyberbullied compared
with 3.6% of the males surveyed. Although there were 3 times
more females in the sample as males, the frequency of
cyberbullying in the female populations remained
disproportionately high, with cyberbullying in college being
reported 5 times more by females in the sample.
Age. An analysis of the sample that experienced
cyberbullying in college only found that 58% (n = 76) of
the participants who reported being cyberbullied in college
were between the ages of 20 and 25, 37% (n = 48) were
between 26 and 29, and 5% (n = 7) were 30 and over.
Reported frequencies demonstrate that, in this study,
participants between the ages of 20 and 25 were 10 times
more likely to report cyberbullying than participants 30 and
over.
Ethnicity. Approximately 56% (n = 74) of the participants
who reported being cyberbullied in college were European
American, 12% (n = 16) were Hispanic American, 12% (n
= 16) were African American, and 19% (n = 25) were Asian
American or Other. To account for the disproportionate
number of European American participants, a Pearson chi-
square analysis was conducted using frequency of
cyberbullying experienced in college and ethnicity.
Analysis indicated that Asian Americans experienced
cyberbullying 4 times or more (32%; n = 8) more frequently
than African American (18%), Hispanic American (18%),
or European American (15%).
Frequency of time on electronic medium. Past research has
linked the amount of time spent on the computer to an
increased risk of experiencing cyberbullying. An analysis of
frequency of cyberbullying experiences and computer use
found no significant relationship between these variables in
this study. This outcome may be due to the majority of the
participants spending significant computer use and high
membership in social networks, creating a ceiling effect.
Similarly, increases in reported computer proficiency did
not indicate an increase in reports of cyberbullying in
college. Again, this outcome can be related to the high
skills level observed in this study, with 51% of the total
sample reporting having advanced skills using computers.
The frequency of time on the computer reported by
participants experiencing cyberbullying in college ranged
from 1 to 7+ hr daily, with 45% of respondents reporting 3
to 4 hr; 25%, 1 to 2 hr; 19%, 5 to 6 hr; and 9%, 7+ hr.
In addition, 93% of participants belonged to some form
of social network, with around 70% belonging to two or
more social website. In spite of these social websites being
an environment in which cyberbullying may take place,
there was no evidence that belonging to a social network
increased incidence of cyberbullying.
Research Question 5: Which Mediums Did
Cyberbullying Occur the Most and by Who?
Approximately 46.1% of the victims reported text
messaging as the most frequent medium for cyberbullying,
followed by 43.5% reporting email, and 36.2% websites.
Also, 44% of students cyberbullied in college reported
being bullied by a fellow student, 42% reported being
cyberbullied by friends, 22.6% by a boyfriend or girlfriend,
22.6% by someone unknown to them, and 5.3% reported
being cyberbullied by a co-worker. It is important to note
Zalaquett and Chatters 5
that 40.4% of the victims indicated they were cyberbullied
by multiple sources involving various combinations of the
abovementioned sources of cyberbullying.
Research Question 6: What Was the Direct
Psychological Effect and Action Taken Following
Cyberbullying?
Cyberbullying seemed to have several direct psychological
effects in this sample. Approximately 45% of the
participants who reported experiencing cyberbullying
reported feeling angry, 41% felt sad, 32% reported
experiencing an increase in stress, and 9% reported
experiencing a loss of productivity. Only 6% reported
experiencing no effects.
Research Question 7: To What Extent Would College
Students Favor Education on Cyberbullying?
Approximately 77% of the total sample favored education
on cyberbullying, which indicates participants feel there is a
need for more education on this type of bullying. In
addition, approximately 38.5% (n = 235) of participants
indicated they had given their phone number to someone
unknown over the Internet, which denotes a need for more
education regarding Internet safety.
Discussion
This study provides further evidence that cyberbullying is a
phenomenon observed beyond K-12 school settings.
Although there is an observed decrease in the number of
cyberbully victims from high school to college,
approximately 19% of college students reported being a
victim of cyberbullying. This prevalence of cyberbullying
in college is similar to and in some cases higher than
previously reported rates of cyberbullying in high school
and college (Finn, 2004; MacDonald & Roberts-Pittman,
2010; Smith et al., 2008; Walker et al., 2011; Zacchilli &
Valerio, 2011). Furthermore, 50% of the college students
who reported being victims of cyberbullying in the current
study also reported experiencing cyberbullying in high
school. The evidence indicates that cyberbullying continues
from high school to college.
Approximately 5% of the college students participating
in this study self-identified as cyberbullies. Past research in
high school students has reported approximately 15% of
their samples as self-identified cyberbullies (Aricak et al.,
2008; Li, 2007). This noticeable discrepancy may be a
result of the increased age and maturity of the participants
or a decrease in the number of participants willing to admit
they have participated in cyberbullying. Also, knowledge of
the negative social perception of cyberbullies may impact
participants' willingness to report cyberbullying activities.
Together, this data suggest that cyberbullying is a
significant issue among college students with the potential
to affect their psychological well-being and mental health.
Psychological Impact
Although the participants of this study may be more
emotionally mature than high school victims of cyberbullying,
college victims still reported significant psychological effects
of cyberbullying. College students indicated cyberbullying
made them sad, angry or upset, and caused an increase in stress
indicating the psychological impact of cyberbullying does not
dissipate as the victim matures. These findings confirm results
from previous studies, which indicate cyberbullying can be a
catalyst for impaired mental health, psychological distress,
provokes fear, and in extreme cases increases risk factors
associated with suicide among college populations (Dilmac,
2009; Hartwell-Walker, 2010; Lindsay & Krysik, 2012;
Zacchilli & Valerio, 2011).
Differences in Gender, Ethnicity, and Age
Different than previous research (Walker et al., 2011),
females were the primary victims in this study. The
frequency of cyberbullying experiences differed among
ethnic groups. Similar to previous research (Goebert, Else,
Matsu, Chung-Do, & Chang, 2011), a higher percentage of
participants, who identified as Asian American or Other
reported higher frequencies of cyberbullying than any other
ethnic group. The difference in reported incidences of
cyberbullying among ethnic groups was troubling, but not
surprising. Research conducted among high school
populations have found cyberbullying to be more prevalent
among multiethnic populations and to have a significant
impact on the well-being and self-esteem of Asian
American and Pacific Islander youth (Goebert et al., 2011).
Regarding cyberbullying and age, the results of this
study showed that college students between the ages of 20
and 25 were more likely to report cyberbullying than
college students 30 years of age and older.
Sources and Mediums of Cyberbullying
A significant percentage of participants (40%) in this study
reported experiencing cyberbullying from multiple known
sources from inside or outside college, including friends,
significant others, and/or co-workers. The primary
electronic medium was cell phone­based texting. Few
participants used chat rooms, which were frequently
mentioned in previous studies.
Education on Cyberbullying
A majority of the respondents in this study favor education
on cyberbullying. These findings are similar to a recent
6 SAGE Open
study conducted by Molluzzo and Lawler (2012) in which
more than 80% of the study participants favored further
education on online harassment.
The results of this study highlight the reported
frequency, characteristics, and psychological impact of
cyberbullying in a large and diverse sample of college
students. These findings were similar to the findings of
previous research in some areas; however, the discrepancies
indicate the importance of conducting research solely
focused on the phenomenon of cyberbullying, as suggested
by MacDonald and Roberts-Pittman (2010). Also,
longitudinal studies are needed to illustrate psychological
impact and the possibility of the delayed effects on
academic achievement over time. The increase in college
students' use of many electronic mediums during their
education and the evidence of cyberbullying behavior
occurring in college via these mediums highlights the
importance of educating this population on the prevalence
and impact of aggressive electronic communication and the
potential dangers of cyberbullying.
Strengths and Limitations of the Research
Strengths of this study include its specific focus on
cyberbullying, large and diverse sample, and high response
rate. The study also expanded the research knowledge
regarding the relationship between frequency of
cyberbullying and age, and the continuity of cyberbullying
experiences from high school to college.
Among the limitations of this study is the potential lack
of knowledge about cyberbullying among college students,
which may result in misinterpretation of these behavior and
subsequent low numbers of reported incidents. Also, many
students reported that they had been bullied in high school
but not in college; however, they reported the effects of
cyberbullying from both high school and college. Their
responses may indicate that the students did not report the
cyberbullying but did report its consequences. Also, the
study uses a measure created by the authors. Future
research may develop a standardized measure of the
prevalence of cyberbullying. In addition, it is important to
note that the study was conducted on a convenience sample
at one institution. Random sampling of college students
from multiple institutions may be used to gain further
understanding of this phenomenon in college students
across the nation.
Implications for Future Research and
Practice
Cyberbullying represent an aggressive form of
communication that utilizes electronic medium and provoke
negative mental health consequences. Zacchilli and Valerio
(2011) indicated a need for further research investigating
the emotional impact of cyberbullying on college
populations. Cyberbullying seemed to be most prevalent
among Asian Americans in this sample, but this finding
also varies across studies. Clearly, further research within
the area of ethnicity and the prevalence of cyberbullying
seems necessary due to variability in findings (Lindsay &
Krysik, 2012). Similarly, variations in the relationship
between cyberbullying and age have been observed across
studies (Beran & Li, 2005; Juvonen & Gross, 2008; Katzer,
Fetchenhauer, & Belschak, 2009; Smith et al., 2008; Varjas,
Henrich, & Meyers, 2009; Wolak, Mitchell, & Finkelhor,
2007; Ybarra & Mitchell, 2004a). Wide variations among
research findings indicate a need for further research to
determine the nature of the relationship between age and
cyberbullying. In addition, research regarding the
relationship of cyberbullying, mental health, and academic
achievement should be pursued to clarify possible
differences among racial and cultural groups in college. It is
important for future research to take place to further
understand this phenomenon in college, determine effective
ways to promote awareness of cyberbullying, and inform
college students about how to deal with this form of
bullying and its harmful effects.
Practical Implications
In an effort to prevent the transition of cyberbullying from
K-12 settings to college, colleges and universities must
implement programmatic changes to advocate for
awareness of this phenomenon. The results of this study
indicate that 75% of the college students sampled favor
education on this topic. Student affairs personnel could
collaborate with high school counselors to incorporate
information on the existence of cyberbullying in college
settings into campus visits and new student orientation
sessions. Due to the negative consequences of this
phenomenon, which in extreme cases can result in suicide,
campus counseling centers should provide workshops to
educate students about the psychological impact of
cyberbullying. In addition, individual and group sessions
may help victims and cyberbullies improve self-esteem and
develop healthier ways to communicate and respond to
online victimization. Campus administrators should
consider allotting financial resources to cyberbullying
education and promote healthy ways to communicate and
deal with conflict. Campus policies should be developed to
deal with the instances of cyberbullying on college
campuses. In addition, education on cyberbullying could be
integrated into undergraduate introductory courses such as
freshmen seminars, human relations courses, and college
experience courses.
Professors in student affairs, counseling education,
educational leadership, and higher education could prepare
secondary school counselors-in-training to provide
information and educational workshops on cyberbullying
for students and parents. In addition, counselor educators,
college counselors, and other professionals could research
the impact of education on cyberbullying on the prevalence
Zalaquett and Chatters 7
of cyberbullying in college. The results of these studies
would help improve efforts to reduce the likelihood of
cyberbullying among college students. Future research on
cyberbullying, its types, causes, mediums, and
psychological correlates is needed to aid in the development
of innovative methods of prevention, education, and
interventions.
