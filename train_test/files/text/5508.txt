Introduction
As a common microvascular complication of diabetes, dia-
betic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end stage
renal disease.1 Diabetes clustering in families suggests that
genetic factors play an important role on occurrence and
development of DN.2­4 It has been confirmed renin-angio-
tensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has an important influ-
ence on the occurrence and development of diabetic
nephropathy.5 As an important component of RAAS,
aldosterone synthase gene has received more and more
attention. But whether aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2)
polymorphism is related to diabetic nephropathy is still
controversial. Up to now, there is no meta-analysis investi-
gating the association between them. To estimate the over-
all risk of aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) polymorphism
associated with diabetic nephropathy and to quantify the
potential between-study heterogeneity, we conducted this
comprehensive meta-analysis.

Abstract
Introduction: Studies on the relation between aldosterone synthase -344 T/C polymorphism and diabetic nephropathy
showed controversial conclusions. This meta-analysis aimed to systematically summarize the association between
aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) gene polymorphism and diabetic nephropathy risk.
Methods: Embase, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Wanfang Data, VIP Database, China Knowledge Resource
Integrated Database and SinoMed have been searched. A total of five studies including 825 cases and 910 controls were
included.
Results: In overall analysis, significant increased risk was found in recessive comparison (OR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.05­1.55),
homozygote comparison (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.04­1.88) and allele comparison (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.05­1.39).
No significant association was detected in dominant comparison (OR = 1.27, 95% CI 0.97­1.66) and heterozygote
comparison (OR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.88­1.56). In subgroup analysis, significant increased risk existed in Asian population in
allele comparison (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.17­1.79), dominant comparison (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.11­2.87), homozygote
comparison (OR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.29­3.47), recessive comparison (OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.17­2.03), except for heterozygote
comparison (OR = 1.44, 95% CI 0.87­2.38).
Conclusions: Our meta-analysis indicates that aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) gene polymorphism may contribute to
diabetic nephropathy development, especially in Asian group, with the T allele acting as a risk factor.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria: (a) case-control study; (b) evaluation of
the association between aldosterone synthase polymor-
phism with DN; (c) detailed data of genotypes distribution
could be acquired or calculated.
Exclusion criteria: (a) reviews, meeting abstracts, edi-
torials and commentaries; (b) study did not meet the inclu-
sion criteria; (c) duplication of previous publications.
Data extraction and synthesis
Two investigators extracted data independently and reached
a consensus by discussing or consulting a third party. The
following contents were extracted from the studies: the first
author's name, publication year, ethnicity of the study pop-
ulation, the characteristics of cases and controls, the geno-
typing method, controls source, sample size of cases and
controls. The alleles frequencies and genotypic distribu-
tions in both cases and controls were extracted or calcu-
lated. In addition, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)
status in controls were tested for each research.
Statistical analyses
Odd ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence
intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to evaluate the strength
of the association between aldosterone synthase CYP11B2
polymorphism and diabetic nephropathy risk. The genetic
models evaluated for pooled ORs of the polymorphisms
were allele comparison (T vs. C), homozygote comparison
(TT vs. CC), heterozygote comparison (TC vs. CC), domi-
nant comparison (TC+TT vs. CC) and recessive compari-
son (TT vs. TC+CC), respectively. Heterogeneity among
studies was checked by the chi-square-based Q statistic
and was considered statistically significant at P < 0.10.6
According to the heterogeneity, the OR was calculated by
using a fixed effects model or a random effects model.7
When P > 0.10, the pooled OR was calculated by using the
fixed effects model, otherwise, the random effects model
was used. The significance of the pooled OR was deter-
mined by a Z-test and P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate
the effect of each study on the combined ORs. Subgroup
analyses were stratified to evaluate the ethnicity specific
effects. Potential publication bias was analyzed by Begg's
funnel plots8 and Egger's test.9 All statistical tests were
performed using STATA 12.0 software.
Results
Characteristics of studies
The research selection process is shown by the flow dia-
gram (Figure 1). A total of 79 potentially eligible studies
were acquired from the databases. According to the
inclusion and exclusion criteria, 74 articles were
excluded and five relevant studies concerning aldoster-
one synthase CYP11B2 polymorphism and diabetic
nephropathy risk were included in our meta-analysis.10­14
The characteristics of each study included in the meta-
analysis are shown in Table 1. The genotype and allele
distributions in each study and HWE status in controls
were also summarized in Table 1. The included studies
containing 825 cases and 910 controls were finally ana-
lyzed in our meta-analysis.
Meta-analysis
This is the first meta-analysis about the association
between aldosterone synthase CYP11B2 polymorphism
and diabetic nephropathy susceptibility. No significant
heterogeneity was identified by Q-test and I-squared sta-
tistic in dominant comparison, recessive comparison,
homozygote comparison and heterozygote comparison.
Therefore, the fixed-effects model was used in above com-
parisons. Significant between-study heterogeneity only
existed in allele comparison, so the random-effects model
was chosen. As the result, a significant increased risk was
found in recessive comparison (TT vs. TC+CC: OR =
1.27, 95% CI 1.05­1.55), homozygote comparison (TT vs.
CC: OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.04­1.88) and allele comparison
(T vs. C: OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.05­1.39) (Figure 2). No
significant association was found in dominant comparison
(TC+TT vs. CC: OR = 1.27, 95% CI 0.97­1.66) and hete-
rozygote comparison (TC vs. CC: OR = 1.17, 95% CI
0.88­1.56) (Table 2).
Next, subgroup analysis was conducted according to
ethnicity. Only one study was about Caucasian, so we
only did descriptive analysis. The research revealed
-344T/C polymorphism of the aldosterone synthase gene
was not associated with initiation or progression of dia-
betic nephropathy in Caucasian type 1 diabetic patients.10
The rest of the four studies were all about Asian popula-
tion, having no significant heterogeneity. The fixed-
effects model was chosen and the pooled analysis results
showed significant increased risk in allele comparison
(T vs. C: OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.17­1.79), dominant
comparison (TC+TT vs. CC: OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.11­
2.87), homozygote comparison (TT vs. CC: OR = 2.11,
95% CI 1.29­3.47), recessive comparison (TT vs.
TC+CC: OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.17­2.03) (Figure 3). Only
in heterozygote comparison (TC vs. CC: OR = 1.44,
95% CI 0.87­2.38) no significant association was found
(shown in Table 2).

Heterogeneity analysis
In the present meta-analysis, significant heterogeneity
only existed in the allele comparison (for T vs. C: PQ
=
0.057, I2 = 56.3%). To clarify the sources of heterogeneity,
we conducted the subgroup analyses based on ethnicity
(Asian or Caucasian), and sensitivity analyses based on
HWE status. The heterogeneity was significantly reduced
after subgroup analyses (PQ
= 0.259, I2 = 25.4%). But it
could not be effectively removed after sensitivity analyses
based on HWE status (PQ
= 0.085, I2 = 59.5%). Then meta-
regression was also performed to explore the other
potential sources of heterogeneity under the allele genetic
model. The confounding factors included publication year,
sample size, quality score, HWE status and genotyping
method. The controls source in each study was similar, so
it was not included. The meta-regression results revealed
that none of these five factors could explain significant
between-study heterogeneity:publication year (P = 0.724),
sample size (P = 0.565), quality score (P = 0.587) and
HWE status (P = 0.604). In addition, we replaced the fixed
effects model for the random effects model to calculate
pooled ORs, and the results were not materially altered.

Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis was performed by omitting one study
at a time and calculating the pooled ORs for the remaining
studies (data were shown in Figure 4). This procedure was
used to explore whether individual study was entirely
responsible for the combined results. We found only one
study had greater effect on the combined results.10 But
after omitting this study, the results were not materially
altered in every genetic model except for dominant
comparison.
Publication bias
Begg's funnel plot and Egger's regression test were per-
formed to assess the publication bias in allele comparison
(T vs. C). No publication bias was identified by Begg's
funnel plot (P = 0.806) or Egger's regression test (P =
0.474). The funnel plots in all genetic models were sym-
metrical (Figure 5, T vs. C).
Discussion
Aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) gene is located on chro-
mosome 8 (8q22), and it contains eight introns and nine
exons.15 Studies have shown that aldosterone synthase
-344 T/C polymorphism was associated with essential
hypertension, stroke and cardiovascular function.16­18 But
studies concerning relations between aldosterone synthase
-344 T/C polymorphism and diabetic nephropathy showed
controversial conclusions. Prasad et al.11 found that T > C
(-344) polymorphisms in aldosterone synthase were sig-
nificantly associated with diabetic chronic renal insuffi-
ciency. Lajer et al.10 maintained the -344T/C polymorphism
of the aldosterone synthase gene was not associated with
initiation or progression of diabetic nephropathy in
Caucasian. So we conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate
the association. And our results were not exactly the same
as previous research results.
As the first meta-analysis focused on the association
between aldosterone synthase -344 T/C polymorphism

and the susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy, our
research analyzed the available data, including a total of
825 cases and 910 controls. In overall population, a sig-
nificant increased risk was found in recessive compari-
son, homozygote comparison and allele comparison. No
significant association existed in dominant comparison
and heterozygote comparison. Subgroup analyses
according to ethnicity were conducted. The results in
Asian population revealed significant increased risk in
allele comparison, dominant comparison, homozygote
comparison and recessive comparison, but not in hete-
rozygote comparison. In the only Caucasian study,
aldosterone synthase -344 T/C polymorphism was found
not associated with diabetic nephropathy in type 1 dia-
betic patients. The different results between Asians and
Caucasians may be accounted for in a number of ways.
Firstly, different genetic and environmental background
in different races may play an important role on gene
phenotypes. Secondly, only one research may not be able
to explain the genotype distribution of aldosterone syn-
thase gene polymorphism in Caucasus diabetic nephrop-
athy patients.
In this meta-analysis, significant heterogeneity only
existed in the allele comparison (T vs. C). After subgroup
analyses the heterogeneity was significantly reduced.
According to the meta-regression result, none of the five
confounding factors including publication year, sample
size, quality score, HWE status and genotyping method
could explain the between-study heterogeneity. So the het-
erogeneity may derive from racial differences mainly.
Then, sensitivity analysis was conducted by omitting one

study at a time. We found one study had greater effect on
the combined results.10 But after omitting the research, the
results were not materially altered in every genetic model
except for in dominant comparison. Moreover, we replaced
the fixed effects model for the random effects model to
calculate pooled OR, and the results were not materially
altered too. No publication bias was identified by Begg's
funnel plot or Egger's regression test. The funnel plots in
all the genetic models were symmetrical. But owing to the
limited number of included studies, power of these two
tests was small. The conclusion needs further support of
larger sample size studies.
When interpreting the results of this meta-analysis,
some limitations should still be considered. Firstly, our
meta-analysis only contained studies in Caucasians and
Asians. We cannot know the genotype distributions in
other ethnic groups. Secondly, the number of included
studies limited further analysis due to shortage of original
studies. Thirdly, the heterogeneity existed in the allele
comparison (T vs. C) should be noted. Ethnicity and sam-
ple size might contribute to the heterogeneity.
In conclusion, the present meta-analysis suggests that
aldosterone synthase -344 T/C polymorphism may be asso-
ciated with increased risks of diabetic nephropathy, espe-
cially among Asian populations. However, larger sample
size studies conducted in different ethnic populations are
required to further evaluate our conclusion in the future.
