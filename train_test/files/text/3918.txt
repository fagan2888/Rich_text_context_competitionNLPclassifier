Inquiry education is central to curricular reform and is based on
principles of social constructivism. Inquiry-based curriculum is
learner-centered, based on student interests and curiosity
(Saunders-Stewart, Gyles, & Shore, 2012), and recommended
acrosssubjectmatter(InternationalBaccalaureateOrganization,
2005; International Reading Association, 2003; National
Council for the Social Studies, 1994; National Council of
Teachers of Mathematics, 2000; National Governors
Association Center for Best Practices, Council of Chief State
School Officers, 2010; National Research Council, 1996).
Several beneficial student outcomes have been identified,
including improved achievement, knowledge application,
thinking and problem-solving skills, and attitudes toward learn-
ing (Saunders-Stewart etal., 2012).There, nevertheless, remain
barriers to inquiry implementation (Shore, Aulls, & Delcourt,
2008; Yore etal., 2007), and certain components are not well
understood, for example, role shifts. Within inquiry, role shifts
occur when a student adopts or takes on a traditional teacher
role, such as evaluating his or her own or another student's
work. A role shift does not imply adding to the current reper-
toire of roles but rather suggests that a role is given up or traded
and replaced with a new role (Aulls & Shore, 2008; Crawford,
2000). The concept of inquiry-role diversification implies that
several roles, including roles not traditionally ascribed to a par-
ticular individual, could potentially be adopted at one time.
Several researchers have provided a foundation for
research on roles (Moreno, 1961; Turner, 1978), role theory
(Biddle, 1986), role acquisition (Thornton & Nardi, 1975;
Yellin, 1999), role taking (Selman, 1971; Selman & Byrne,
1974), and role sets (Merton, 1957a). Walker, Shore, and
Tabatabai (2013, 2015) concluded that opportunities occur
frequently in inquiry classrooms to facilitate adopting multi-
ple and varied roles at the same time. No model yet exists to
explain role diversification within inquiry. Although teachers
enact multiple roles in the course of a curriculum unit or time
period and many of these roles are unique to inquiry-based
versus traditional instruction (Aulls & Ibrahim, 2012), no
research has addressed as a central part of its model the com-
plexity of roles within inquiry or, in particular, the permuta-
tions of role changes or diversification of roles that can occur.
Multiple roles and role shifts are visibly present in descrip-
tions of inquiry, but no existing framework explores the vari-
ous role processes that can occur, including diversification.

Understanding Classroom Roles in Inquiry
Education: Linking Role Theory and Social
Constructivism to the Concept of Role
Diversification
Cheryl L. Walker1 and Bruce M. Shore1
Abstract
Inquiry-based teaching and learning are rooted in social constructivism and are central to curricular reform. Role theory and
social constructivism provided insight into a commonly observed but insufficiently understood phenomenon in inquiry. Within
inquiry, role shifts have been described as the switching of roles between students and teachers; however, the process may
be better conceptualized as role diversification because students and teachers may undertake multiple roles simultaneously
in inquiry. This article expands on existing research and proposes a framework potentially applicable to both learners and
teachers, but here focused on learners. Beyond exploration, engagement, and stabilization of roles, diversification was added
and described. This framework expanded on current education theory, adding new insight to a minimally explored topic, with
implications for students, teachers, consultants, and researchers.

Based on specific tenets from different role theories and
from research on inquiry-based teaching and learning, we
propose a four-part inquiry framework that can be applied to
various age groups. This proposed inquiry framework draws
from previous models within role theory but adds new insight
into the role-diversification process in particular. Although
common in inquiry, there are other classroom settings in
which this framework may apply, including discovery-learning
settings. Diversification is not as salient within traditional set-
tings. This four-component framework adds the new essen-
tial process of role diversification to three other processes
that have been described in previous research, specifically,
exploration, engagement, and stabilization.
Implicit and explicit classroom rules are learned during
exploration, for example, the importance of taking initiative
in inquiry classrooms (Thornton & Nardi, 1975). Engagement
is characterized by formally learning about what it means to
be an inquiry student and beginning to participate in the asso-
ciated expectations, for example, learning and experimenting
with question asking in the classroom (Shore, Birlean, Walker,
Ritchie, LaBanca, & Aulls, 2009). Stabilization is character-
ized by commitment to being an inquiry student, for example,
attaining a level of comfort with problems that are not well
defined (Shore etal., 2009). During the process of diversifi-
cation, students adopt varied roles in the classroom, for exam-
ple, adopting the traditional student role of learner alongside
the traditional teacher role of evaluator. There is a theoretical
gap when it comes to the concept of diversification, and this
article presents an opportunity to better understand the roles
that learners and teachers can undertake.
A better understanding of role diversification in the class-
room can provide teachers with additional information about
individual student progress. Teachers can observe progress
in student learning through an awareness of new roles that
students take on or adopt, in addition to increased knowledge
and skills within the subject matter.
Few articles, if any, have addressed the overlap and con-
nections between the core theoretical knowledge bases of
inquiry and role theory. Aulls and Ibrahim (2012) elaborated
numerous roles within inquiry; however, they did not focus
on the diversification process within inquiry. Thornton and
Nardi (1975), Yellin (1999), and Turner (2002) discussed the
process of role acquisition but not in the context of inquiry
teaching and learning environments, and none referred to a
process of role diversification. The proposed framework
examined the overlap and connections between role theory
and inquiry theory and provided a foundational guideline for
further research into the process of diversification.
Social Constructivism and Inquiry
Social Constructivism
In an educational context, constructivism can be described
as understanding that occurs as a result of a learner's mental
activities. Although an individual actively constructs his or
her own knowledge, social interactions strongly influence
this process (Bereiter, 1994; Bruning, Schraw, & Ronning,
1995), and social constructivism embraces this process well.
Social constructivism describes student learning as well as
teaching. Based on Popper's ideas, Bereiter (1994) explained
that knowledge or student learning is built on, or improved,
through a collective process of creation and construction.
Social constructivism, therefore, describes the interconnec-
tions among individuals and their social worlds (Ernest,
1995). Developmentally, Vygotsky (1978, 1986) stated that
verbal communication among children and between chil-
dren and adults is a powerful force in helping them acquire
conceptual knowledge. Such interaction provides a richer
range of use of concepts than an individual might construct
on his or her own and provides feedback and scaffolding for
that construction. Children learn to speak through dialog
and later understand the meaning of speech by making sub-
jective connections among concepts. Children therefore
need to be challenged with learning material that they would
most likely be unable to complete on their own, but, with
help, could learn successfully (zone of proximal develop-
ment; Vygotsky, 1978). Llewellyn (2002) expanded this by
considering internal factors including the learner's prior
cognitive experiences that influence the ways in which new
information is interpreted and understood. Therefore,
knowledge and understanding are in a constant construction
and reconstruction process. Smith, Maclin, Houghton, and
Hennessey (2000) also described a constructivist classroom
as a place where students develop their ideas through dialog
with their peers. This hypothesis testing or attempting to
make sense of one's own ideas as well as the ideas of one's
peers occurs within the classroom, and individuals in this
type of classroom can also be considered a community of
learners (Brown & Campione, 1994). The teacher frequently
scaffolds learning. Teaching in a social-constructivist envi-
ronment, therefore, needs to encourage knowledge forma-
tion and foster skill development, including judgment and
organization (Bruning etal., 1995). Teachers act primarily
as coaches or facilitators, rather than merely as information
transmitters.
Smith and colleagues (2000) considered idea develop-
ment as a complex process involving multiple steps and also
as a collaborative process in which colleagues work together
and evaluate each other's ideas. Constructivist classrooms
were described as emphasizing group work, dialog, and
shared norms. Students described how sharing ideas helps
with understanding one's own ideas and also helps create
new ideas. Learning was also described as a process of per-
spective taking and determining the interrelations of differ-
ent perspectives. This emphasis on learning through social
interaction and perspective taking relates closely to the role
taking that occurs in inquiry. Role taking in inquiry requires
the ability to adopt the perspective of another person in a dif-
ferent role and be able to use that knowledge to enact the role
Walker and Shore 3
for oneself. This can involve social interactions with that
individual as the person learns about the role they may
choose to take on in the future.
Inquiry-Based Teaching and Learning
Inquiry-based teaching and learning classrooms are largely
based on social-constructivist precepts and have been a
central focus of curricular reform throughout North America
and beyond. The National Research Council (1996) defined
inquiry as
a multifaceted activity that involves making observations; posing
questions; examining books and other sources of information to see
what is already known; planning investigations; reviewing what is
already known in light of experimental evidence; using tools to
gather,analyze,andinterpretdata;proposinganswers,explanations,
and predictions; and communicating the results. (p. 23)
Therefore, inquiry broadly involves learning through ques-
tion asking based on curiosity or interest. This helps create
an authentic learning environment that contributes to an indi-
vidual's inherent motivation to further one's own knowledge
(Aulls & Shore, 2008; Robinson & Hall, 2008). Aulls and
Shore (2008) emphasized inquiry as an active process, driven
by student interest, with knowledge construction as the main
goal while building hypothesis formulation and problem-
solving skills.
Inquiry-based instruction fosters motivation for indepen-
dent learning, enhances critical-thinking skills and problem
solving, and promotes subject-matter understanding, curiosity,
increased confidence, and teamwork (Aulls & Shore, 2008).
The International Baccalaureate (IB) program adopted inquiry-
based teaching and learning centrally in its curriculum. IB pro-
grams were originally developed to provide standardized
international entrance exams to university, recognizable in all
countries. They provide a challenging education that promotes
active learning and cultural understanding with inquiry
intended as a privileged pedagogy (Chichekian & Shore,
2014; International Baccalaureate Organization, 2005).
To be an inquirer involves some level of inquiry literacy.
Shore and colleagues (2009) described inquiry literacy as the
ability to critically understand and also be able to effectively
use the language, symbols, and skills of inquiry during an
activity. Becoming inquiry literate requires explicit instruc-
tion from teachers, parents, or peers, in addition to experi-
ence. Some of the indicators of inquiry literacy include the
ability to take ownership of one's learning, pursuing one's
interests without depending on a teacher, understanding why
one is engaged in an inquiry process, seeking relevant evi-
dence, realizing that there are multiple approaches to prob-
lem solving, and understanding that learning is a process.
Part of being an inquirer or being inquiry literate therefore
necessarily involves taking on different roles that students
may not take on in a traditional classroom setting, such as the
role of question asker, analyst, or communicator. Similarly,
Holbrook and Kolodner (2000) discussed the need for stu-
dents to be comfortable with the active learning that occurs
within inquiry classrooms. Specifically, they determined that
teachers preferred students to have experience with complex
processes (e.g., communication and collaboration) prior to
learning concepts within a science classroom. Teacher and
student roles were discussed, particularly in regard to the
role shift that is common and whereby the traditional teacher
role of setting and enforcing tasks is lessened. A "launcher"
unit addressed much of the skill development needed for
understanding process before content in inquiry. This may
parallel some of the characteristics of the exploration,
engagement, and stabilization processes because the launcher
unit refers to the engagement and development among stu-
dents of a common language that can become an anchor for
further skill development in additional and varied contexts,
such as that needed for diversification to occur.
Aulls and Shore (2008) addressed the differences in stu-
dent and teacher roles in inquiry environments compared with
more traditional educational settings. Teacher roles in inquiry
were defined as "actions, verbal interactions with students,
and responsibilities undertaken to support students'participa-
tion in components of inquiry such as projects, experiments,
laboratories, hypothesizing" (p. 14). Aulls and Shore pro-
posed that student and teacher roles in inquiry exist along a
continuum from roles enacted in teacher-directed inquiry, to
teacher-guided inquiry, to student-centered inquiry. In
teacher-directed inquiry, the teacher is responsible for student
learning; in teacher-guided inquiry, the teacher and students
share this responsibility; and in student-centered inquiry, the
students take the lead, and the teacher acts as a consultant. In
student-centered inquiry, teachers often shift from playing the
role of instructor to the role of facilitator, and students tend to
move from playing a more passive to an active role in their
learning (e.g., sharing in the evaluation of their own work).
As opposed to surrendering a role in favor of another, in
inquiry, students and teachers may take on additional and
sometimes overlapping roles, leading to diversification of
their respective role repertoires. Biggers and Forbesa (2012)
also recognized the inquiry continuum in terms of teacher and
student directedness. Throughout a series of science lessons,
early lessons were more student-directed whereas later les-
sons were more teacher-directed, indicating that movement
can occur along that continuum of inquiry. The proposed
framework can be applied to all types of inquiry; however, the
nature of the roles may differ in each setting. For example, the
roles in teacher-directed inquiry may be more similar to roles
seen in traditional classroom settings (e.g., the teacher may
adopt the primary role of knowledge provider). Overall, there
are differences in the types and numbers of roles when tradi-
tional classroom settings are compared with inquiry settings
and also when various types of inquiry settings are compared
among themselves (Aulls & Ibrahim, 2012)
The issues introduced above are elaborated further below.
4 SAGE Open
Role Theory
In inquiry, conceptualization of roles has been limited. Role
theory can assist understanding the complexities in this pro-
cess. Prominent early role theorists, including Moreno (1946,
1961), Mead (1934), and Linton (1936), have investigated
this concept since the 1930s and, although this research orig-
inated more than three quarters of a century ago, it remains
informative. The literature on social constructivism, for
example, dates from a similar time, yet it has substantially
influenced current curricular reforms. The study of role
research and theories does offer advantages; however, the
research is often fraught with inconsistent and conflicting
definitions, discrepant models, confusion, and a lack of inte-
gration (Biddle, 1986). Biddle explained how role theorists
differed in their conceptualizations of expectations respon-
sible for roles. For example, some role theorists considered
expectations to be prescriptive or based on norms, whereas
others assumed expectations to be beliefs or preferences.
These differences in expectations may result in adopting
roles but for different underlying reasons, and therefore sub-
tle differences in the role expression may become apparent.
Biddle also described differences in role theorists'conditions
for roles, for example, that roles occur within a social sys-
tem. Although outlining discrepancies, Biddle summarized
how most role theorists assume that the primary force in
determining roles arises from social expectations formed
through experience and awareness of the expectations for
particular roles (Merton, 1957b; Turner, 2002).
Examining the history of role theory from its beginnings
offers insights into the evolution of roles over time and can
help inform new models related to roles and role theory. Turner
(2002), who also wrote about roles earlier (1978), defined a
role as a "cluster of behaviors and attitudes that are thought to
belong together, so that an individual is viewed as acting con-
sistently when performing the various components of a single
role and inconsistently when failing to do so" (p. 233). Turner
further described how a person adopts the attitudes, beliefs,
and behaviors accompanying a role, and social interaction can
facilitate this process and ultimately affect personality forma-
tion. Furthermore, individuals may take on multiple roles
(Merton, 1957b). Merton (1957a) also differentiated the notion
of multiple roles from a role set.Arole set is based on relation-
ships that emerge from specific social statuses. For example, a
teacher's role set includes students, other teachers, the princi-
pal, and professional organizations.
Several variables influence roles and role acquisition.
Examining these variables provides further context for the
proposed inquiry framework. Role influences include atti-
tudes and beliefs (Kedar-Voivodas, 1983; Kinchin, 2004;
Lyons, 1990), norms and expectations (Ryu & Sandoval,
2010; Webb, 2009), experience (Eick & Reed, 2002; Kagan,
1992; Knowles, 1992), and social factors (Chandler & Helm,
1984; Kohlberg, 1969; Reiman & Peace, 2002; Selman,
1980; Yackel, Cobb, & Wood, 1991; Zack & Graves, 2001).
Only some of these studies focused specifically on a social-
constructivist or inquiry-based teaching and learning context
(notably, Eick & Reed, 2002; Kinchin, 2004; Kohlberg,
1969; Reiman & Peace, 2002; Webb, 2009; Zack & Graves,
2001); however, all pointed to the importance of these vari-
ables in classrooms, and therefore, they should be considered
when developing a framework for student­teacher role
diversification.
Role taking has been extensively researched by Selman,
who defined the concept as "the ability to view the world
(including the self) from another's perspective" (Selman,
1971, p. 1722). Selman added that this skill requires the abil-
ity to understand another individual's capabilities, attributes,
expectations, feelings, and reactions. Selman and Byrne
(1974) later defined role taking as "the ability to understand
the self and others as subjects, to react to others as like the
self, and to react to the self's behavior from the other's point
of view" (p. 803). Role taking within classrooms may not be
as clear-cut due to other variables of influence, including stu-
dent engagement and levels of classroom interaction. Student
engagement is dependent on a sense of agency or indepen-
dence (Engle & Conant, 2002). Herrenkohl and Guerra (1998)
examined student engagement, role taking, and social interac-
tion within a science class. Categories of intellectual roles
were presented to the teacher and students, who were then
responsible for describing and operationally defining these
categories: predicting and theorizing, summarizing results,
and relating evidence or results to theory and prediction.
Intellectual audience roles were assigned by the researchers
to one class, but not the others. These roles required that stu-
dents check each other's work, for example, to ensure that a
student assignment contained a prediction. When students
took on audience roles, the teacher's roles and responsibili-
ties shifted and most of the cognitive work was distributed
among the students. Audience roles required that students ask
for clarification to fully understand, and this resulted in more
active engagement of the students as they self-monitored and
challenged presented information. Students who took on
audience roles were more engaged and shared in the con-
struction of knowledge with their peers, which led to a shift
in the teacher role toward mediator and monitor within the
classroom.
Diversification and Related Constructs
Somethingismissinginotherrole-theorymodels.Diversification
is a novel term that differs from the concepts of role shift and
role sets. Role diversification involves taking on a larger, more
varied number of roles and roles that are not necessarily tradi-
tional in nature. Diversification refers to a process of expanding
the repertoire of roles that an individual adopts, in number and
variety. This overlaps with related constructs but differs in sev-
eral ways. For example, diversification is not the same as a role
shift because a role shift suggests that one role is given up or
traded and replaced with a new role (Aulls & Shore, 2008;
Walker and Shore 5
Crawford, 2000). In diversification, students may take on sev-
eral different roles at once and may take on the roles of other
parties without giving up existing roles. Furthermore, roles
adopted during diversification may be roles that are not tradi-
tionally ascribed to that individual, for example, when a student
takes on a traditional teacher role of evaluator. Diversification
also differs from the notion of a role set or an expected set of
behaviors between matching roles, for example, between that of
a student and teacher. Diversification allows each person to
potentially adopt both so-called teacher and student roles at the
same time. This process can be observed over the course of a
class, teaching unit, or school year.There are no time constraints
in terms of when diversification occurs.
Being able to perceive how another person might respond
is not the same as adopting that person's role in that situation.
Perspective taking seems to be a necessary but not sufficient
component of role diversification. Diversification represents
an overarching construct that involves many related con-
structs, including role shifts, role sets, and perspective taking.
Within inquiry, students have additional opportunities to
expand their repertoire of roles. Students take on the learner
role, but may also simultaneously adopt an evaluator or
question-asker role, and this then influences the existing
learner role so that roles are constantly evolving. For exam-
ple, when a teacher stops a lesson and prompts the students
to ask questions, the teacher is now encouraging students to
adopt a question-asker role, thereby shaping their learning
experience and their existing role as learner. Creating oppor-
tunities for adopting diverse and varied roles happens often
within inquiry classrooms. Gyles (2011) examined students'
frequencies of reported experiences with 23 criterion-refer-
enced student-inquiry outcomes (Saunders-Stewart et
al.,
2012; Saunders-Stewart, Gyles, Shore, & Bracewell, 2015)
and concluded that even moderate levels of inquiry use led to
the adoption of new student roles.
Inquiry Framework
The proposed framework is not a stage model but involves
several processes of individual evolution and change that
build on one's own individual repertoire of inquiry skills and
roles. Students can adopt a number of different roles and do
so in a unique and evolutionary way. Diversification may
actually be observed within the processes of exploration,
engagement, or stabilization.
Role-Acquisition Models and Links to
Inquiry
There are several role-acquisition theories; however, none has
specifically focused on an inquiry-learning environment. Three
existing role-acquisition models are reviewed. Two of these
models are presented primarily as stage theories; however, the
proposed framework does not incorporate this perspective.
Fundamental concepts from the reviewed models form the
basis for the proposed inquiry framework, with the exception
of diversification. Descriptions of how individuals transition
between different phases of role acquisition are limited. Links
to inquiry can be identified, permitting creation of a proposed
framework to explain common processes that occur within
inquiry classrooms. Role diversification can occur in any
environment; it does not occur exclusively in inquiry, how-
ever, there are numerous characteristics of inquiry environ-
ments in which role diversification is relevant and essential.
For example, Shore etal. (2009) identified several inquiry
characteristics that involve a certain diversification of roles.
As an example of essential inquiry-student knowledge, they
characterized inquiry as goal-driven, with shared objectives
among students and teachers. This requires others' collabora-
tion to negotiate a consensus regarding the learning goals.
These negotiation skills require active engagement and may
therefore necessitate a role shift from passive recipient to
active collaborator. In addition, an essential student skill
required for inquiry literacy is the ability to ask relevant ques-
tions, both for oneself and for an appropriate audience. Doing
the latter requires adopting the role of presenter or question
asker, and also the role of audience member to ensure that the
question will be relevant and nontrivial, therefore, illustrating
role diversification.
Bracewell, Le Maistre, Lajoie, and Breuleux (2008) exam-
ined role shifts in inquiry, specifically, changes in six teach-
ers' knowledge and beliefs in a technology-driven teaching
environment. Technology in the classroom allowed students
to take on more active and differentiated learning roles.
Although teachers were initially concerned about the greater
autonomy provided to students through technology, these
concerns eventually faded and the increased student indepen-
dence led to a change in teachers' own perspectives toward
teaching and learning. This was labeled release of agency and
defined as "the psychological decision that accompanies
(indeed, allows) a teacher to make the well-documented
change in roles from a didactic instructor to a coach who
facilitates student academic inquiry" (Bracewell etal., 2008,
p. 292). Success meant that teachers had to be comfortable
with the changes spurred by technology in their classrooms.
Although this research specifically focused on the introduc-
tion of classroom technology, it identified several ideas rele-
vant to inquiry, including the "release of agency" concept that
parallels the role-diversification process.
Similar to competing theories for roles, there are several
role-acquisition models, none of which has been widely
accepted (Yellin, 1999). Synthesizing these theories and
focusing on links to inquiry provided the impetus for the pro-
posal of a coherent and comprehensive inquiry framework
that includes the process of diversification. Only three role
models most relevant to inquiry are presented.
Thornton and Nardi (1975)
Thornton and Nardi defined a role as behavioral, attitudinal,
and cognitive expectations imposed on a person within a par-
ticular social position. They outlined a four-phase progression
6 SAGE Open
of role acquisition whereby individuals move from passive
role acceptance to active role engagement. During the antici-
patory phase, individuals begin to socially and psychologi-
cally prepare themselves for the new role and have a general
notion of what will be required based on stereotypes. In an
inquiry environment, students with minimal inquiry experi-
ence may enter a classroom with preconceived notions of tra-
ditionalclassroomvalues(e.g.,predominantlyteacher-directed
in which the majority of class time is in lecture format),
potentially leading to more difficulties adapting to their new
inquiry environment. Inquiry students are often expected to
make certain curricular decisions, evaluate evidence, and take
initiatives in their learning (Aulls & Shore, 2008).
In the formal phase, individuals view their role from a
more internal perspective. Formal written rules or duties
replace initial stereotypes. Although Thornton and Nardi
believed that this phase implied a high degree of consensus,
this may differ greatly in an inquiry classroom. Rules or
duties in a traditional classroom setting are often overtly
stated and can include listening to the teacher and remaining
seated unless told otherwise. In an inquiry classroom, these
rules can be quite different, for example, asking questions,
listening to your peers, and challenging evidence. A student
unfamiliar with inquiry and who expects to sit quietly and
listen to the teacher without questioning any of the informa-
tion may be uncomfortable with the new expectations to be
more actively involved in the learning process.
During the informal phase, individuals begin to learn the
new role's informal rules generally understood through inter-
actions among individuals within the system. Increased con-
flict and decreased consensus regarding different formal and
informal expectations characterize this phase. In an inquiry
environment, a student expecting to sit and listen to the
teacher may have trouble asking questions, working as part
of a team, or hypothesizing, especially if that individual is
shy. Once the student begins to adapt to this new environ-
ment, he or she might encounter the informal rule of politely
interrupting if one has a good idea during a discussion. This
may not be as difficult for the student to accept if he or she
has learned formal inquiry rules, such as asking questions or
generating hypotheses.
In the personal phase, individual characteristics, includ-
ing personality, past experiences, unique skills, and cultural
beliefs, may affect the role. Individuals also modify the role
by imposing their own expectations to better fit their person-
ality. This relates well to role diversification, because it rec-
ognizes the changing nature of roles and acknowledges the
possibility for adopting new role behaviors.
Yellin (1999)
Yellin aimed to better understand role-acquisition dynamics
and also considered a role to be a set of expectations based
on behaviors, attitudes, skills, and knowledge, and that indi-
viduals influence expectations through modification and
negotiation. Yellin proposed that transitions between phases
of role acquisition are marked by specific events that signify
a move to the next phase and, at these points, individuals
would have a different understanding of the role.
In the first phase, ambivalence, individuals are exposed to
a new social network, and therefore have a vague conception
of what is expected in the new role. This can lead to role
ambivalence or role disorientation. Individuals unfamiliar
with inquiry may be overwhelmed by the changed expecta-
tions in this context compared with a traditional setting.
In the second phase, absorption, individuals familiarize
themselves with the new role through repetition, negotiation,
and performance. Individuals begin to learn specific behav-
iors and expectations of the role very quickly, leading to
changes in self-image. The individual in the new role may
feel overwhelmed or frustrated. This phase explains a work-
place context well; however, it may not describe an inquiry
educational setting as effectively because inquiry roles are
highly individualized based on student interest.
In the next phase, commitment, an acceptable perfor-
mance in a particular role has already been attained and
therefore the person often receives positive feedback from
others in similar roles. Individuals identify with the role and
commit to it leading to enhanced self-worth. The role
becomes a part of the person. Yellin noted that, at this phase,
conflict is also common because, when an individual accepts
that he or she is undertaking a new role, it may not match the
individual's previously existing roles. For example, the role
of organizer at school may conflict with a disorganized envi-
ronment at home. This is relevant to inquiry in which role
diversification involves taking on multiple roles; however, it
differs in that these multiple roles are usually adopted in one
setting.
In the final phase, confidence, the role becomes predict-
able and confidence increases. The individual is able to
anticipate and plan responses in advance based on others'
expectations. Although this can reduce anxiety, it can also
lead to boredom because there are only slight changes or per-
formance variations in the role. The struggle in this phase
therefore becomes finding methods to renew motivation, for
example, adding responsibilities to the role or taking on a
new role. This is relevant to inquiry environments, known to
foster motivation in students, perhaps due to the role diversi-
fication that occurs in inquiry, leading to new challenges and
promoting excitement when novel roles are enacted.
Turner (2002)
Turner (2002) detailed several characteristics that related
well to role acquisition. Interactional theories assume that
role behavior derives from social interactions and that roles
are broader and represent a "comprehensive pattern for
behavior and attitude that is linked to an identity, is socially
identified more or less clearly as an entity, and is subject to
being played recognizably by different individuals" (p. 234).
Walker and Shore 7
This may be relevant to a more open-ended context such
as inquiry, in which students and teachers can engage in mul-
tiple roles simultaneously. Expectations and interactions
with others shape the role acquisition. Roles are learned
through observations made as children, and are learned in
sets or pairs, for example, the roles of student and teacher.
When individuals in the set learn about each other's roles,
role transitions are facilitated. Depth of roles can vary: They
tend to persist, be difficult to change, and require extensive
support during transitions. This may explain why some stu-
dents struggle when newly engaged in inquiry. If we can
learn more about role diversification, we can better support
students during these transitions.
Specific to role acquisition is Turner's role-allocation
concept: The individual works toward a certain role while
others either facilitate or hinder his or her progression, which
then invokes a negotiation process. For example, if a student
asked a genuine question in class but during an inappropriate
time, the teacher may chastise this student as disruptive
rather than view her or him as inquisitive, hindering acquisi-
tion of a questioner role.
Proposed Four-Process Inquiry
Framework
Having a framework to help explain common processes in
inquiry can provide methods to better support students and
teachers in implementing this form of education. As previ-
ously highlighted, one must take into account attitudes and
beliefs, behaviors, norms, expectations, previous experience,
and social factors. In addition, the inquiry continuum is an
essential consideration because inquiry classrooms will look
different depending on whether they are more teacher-directed
or student-centered, and this can therefore influence role pro-
cesses in inquiry. Student-centered inquiry classrooms may be
more facilitative of role diversification than teacher-directed
inquiry classrooms. Another key variable that several models
have not addressed is the individual's developmental level,
which becomes especially applicable in school settings.
Framework processes are described predominantly from
the student's perspective for the sake of simplicity; however,
teachers or other individuals in the classroom system may
also undergo similar processes in an inquiry environment.
Several of the models previously described focused heavily
on the cognitive components of role acquisition and diversifi-
cation, whereas the proposed framework emphasizes both
cognitive and behavioral components. Based on the above
models, an inquiry framework is proposed, including the pro-
cesses of exploration, engagement, stabilization, and diversi-
fication. This is not a stage model wherein each process
necessarily follows chronologically. Diversification can take
place in a nondevelopmental manner if the inquiry classroom
facilitates the process. Within the proposed framework, diver-
sification has the potential to emerge in the context of explo-
ration, engagement, or stabilization. For the most part, the
process of diversification builds on skills acquired during the
stabilization process that builds on skills acquired during the
engagement process, which in turn builds on skills acquired
during the exploration process; however, these processes can
and do overlap. The process of engagement may occur at dif-
ferent rates, or a student may experience stabilization prior to
engagement in certain inquiry situations (e.g., one student
might be very committed to working within a collaborative
group before fully engaging as an individual in inquiry).
Furthermore, a student can gain some practice with diversifi-
cation during the exploration process when general inquiry
rules and expectations are being introduced. These processes
are, therefore, adaptable in terms of the timing of their occur-
rence (see Figure 1).
Exploration
Inquiry classrooms often run against teachers', students', and
even parents' expectations, which heavily influence roles and
role acquisition. As supported by Thornton and Nardi (1975),
exploration involves learning about the implicit and explicit
school and classroom rules as they pertain to inquiry in addi-
tion to different roles that are possible in inquiry classrooms.
Shore etal. (2009) identified elements of student knowledge
essential to inquiry success and suggested that inquiry can
occur without an abundance of specific formal information;
however, students do require pertinent language, symbols,
and skills to be considered inquiry literate.
Unlike more traditional classrooms in which students have
some idea of what to expect, an inquiry classroom contains
several differences that might run counter to students' initial
Figure 1. Visual representation of proposed inquiry framework
containing four processes of engagement, exploration,
stabilization, and diversification.
8 SAGE Open
expectations about their different roles as students coming
into the classroom. For example, some students expect to
learn and memorize facts instead of generalized skills that can
be applied in many different settings (Bramwell-Rejskind,
Halliday, & McBride, 2008). This is also partially consistent
with Yellin's (1999) conception of the ambivalence phase in
which an individual only has a vague idea of what to expect
in the new role. Similarly, Yellin highlighted the challenges of
continuing in the new role once motivation is lost. This idea
is relevant to students who struggle adjusting to an inquiry
environment, and this may lead to underachievement.
Conflicting expectations may make it more difficult for
students to initially engage within an inquiry-student role.
This also depends on the teacher's inquiry experience and
how well the classroom is structured based on the students'
prior inquiry experience. As a hypothetical example, consider
Emily, a fifth-grade student beginning her very first inquiry-
based unit on the environment. Her teacher has just presented
information about the qualities that will be expected of stu-
dents throughout the course of the upcoming unit, including
taking risks and exploring new ideas. Emily has never heard
of some of these inquiry qualities and begins to feel over-
whelmed by these initial expectations. The assignment for the
day is to work with a partner to choose one of the described
qualities and select a magazine image that illustrates that
quality of an inquirer. Emily does not know many students
well, and she is the last student to choose a partner. After 5
min, Emily and her partner have still not decided which qual-
ity they should choose. The teacher announces that it is time
to present their image to the class, and Emily begins to feel
anxious because they are not finished.
This example illustrates how exploration involves learn-
ing about an inquiry setting and how the role expectations in
these environments may differ dramatically from role expec-
tations in a traditional classroom setting. For example, Emily
not only had to make her own partner selection, but she also
was responsible for choosing the assignment theme and
image. This activity required initiative, teamwork, commu-
nication, and creativity. These differing role expectations can
create challenges for some students, at least at particular
times.
Engagement
Engagement is a process in which the inquiry student begins
to formally adopt and engage in an inquiry-student role, such
as a question-asker role. The pupil also begins to learn about
specific obligations that are expected of an inquiry student,
for example, generating questions, taking initiatives, listen-
ing and discussing respectfully, organizing information, and
interpreting data effectively for oneself and others (Shore
etal., 2009).
Samarapungavan, Patrick, and Mantzicopoulos (2011)
examined the development of inquiry process variables within a
kindergarten population and also the impact of science-inquiry
activities on student learning and motivation. The Science
Learning Assessment­Version 2 (Samarapungavan,
Mantzicopoulos, Patrick, & French, 2009; Samarapungavan
et
al., 2011) was administered, and this assessment included
items addressing student's understanding of inquiry processes
and content. They also differentiated between pre-inquiry,
inquiry, and post-inquiry phases. Pre-inquiry activities were
described as "whole class activities that are meant to activate
children's prior knowledge, introduce the purpose of the inves-
tigations, and provide children with the framework for tasks at
hand" (Samarapungavan etal., 2011, p. 431). This resembles
the engagement process of the proposed framework. The
inquiry phase involves active involvement in inquiry activi-
ties and post-inquiry activities refer to reflection on learning
and sharing what was learned with others. With appropriate
scaffolding, Kindergarten pupils developed complex under-
standings of the processes required to engage in scientific
inquiry.
Conflict may arise during the engagement process when
traditional student-role expectations are contrasted with the
expectations of an inquiry-student role. For example, some
students do not believe that they should have input on cur-
ricular content (Wolf & Fraser, 2008). In other cases, inquiry
expectations and cultural beliefs or values may conflict. For
example, Chinese students may consider questioning the
teacher as being disrespectful (Li, 2003).
Engagement is similar to previously described models but
also differs in critical ways. Matching Thornton and Nardi's
(1975) beliefs, prior expectations influence the engagement
process; however, consensus levels may differ. Thornton and
Nardi conceptualized their second phase as involving a high
degree of consensus; however, in inquiry, engagement may
involve some degree of conflict when expectations do not
match the inquiry classroom's reality. Thornton and Nardi's
model may apply better to work environments in which a
high degree of role consensus is expected or even necessary,
at least during the enactment or carrying out versus the plan-
ning of work. Disagreements in inquiry occur often and can
sometimes be advantageous when they lead to a leveling of
intragroup power relationships and improvement in under-
standing another individual's perspective (Barfurth & Shore,
2008). Although Yellin's (1999) model was well suited to
specific workplace settings, the element of learning specific
role behaviors in Yellin's absorption phase is similar to
inquiry engagement.
Continuing with the hypothetical example of Emily, her
class is now well into the environment unit. Emily has learned
a lot about how an inquiry classroom functions. The most
recent assignment involves working in a small group to brain-
storm different ways to recycle or re-use common household
items. A member of Emily's group asks her if she has any
ideas. Emily describes how she saves yogurt cups for organiz-
ing her beads. Her group members excitedly write down her
creative idea, and later Emily asks a question to one of the
members about his idea for recycling and reusing items from
Walker and Shore 9
home. In this part of the example, Emily begins to learn the
value of question asking and discussing respectfully in a team
setting, indicating she is demonstrating engagement.
Stabilization
Stabilization involves solidifying a student or teacher's com-
mitment to working within an inquiry classroom. It occurs
once the individual has explored various inquiry-role expec-
tations, he or she has found it to be a positive experience, and
then he or she has fully engaged in its expectations. At this
point, inquiry-literate individuals positively value collabora-
tion, are comfortable with problems that are not well defined,
look for patterns across knowledge areas, think imagina-
tively and critically, and acknowledge multiple solutions to
problems (Shore etal., 2009).
As in Turner's (1978, 2002) interactional role theory,
interactions among those who have committed to inquiry
influence the role-acquisition process. Thornton and Nardi
(1975) considered the informal phase to feature increased
conflict; however, in inquiry, due to the struggle experienced
during engagement, students' conflicting sentiments will
most likely be resolved before experiencing stabilization.
Emerging inquirers will usually have already experienced
differing expectations and may have accepted a certain level
of uncertainty. According to Yellin's (1999) commitment
phase, the role becomes a part of the individual's identity.
Yellin's assertion that this phase is characterized by increased
conflict may also be more relevant to diversification, when
the individual adopts multiple and varied roles. Perhaps the
content and nature of the conflicts might be different.
Within Emily's classroom, the students are working on
another unit activity, and have been asked to write a hypo-
thetical letter to the mayor of the city proposing a new way
for the city to help protect the environment. With the new
inquiry skills Emily has been learning throughout the unit,
including researching online and obtaining input from a fel-
low classmate, she has proposed a yearly event in which
members of the community join together to collect litter, fol-
lowed by a barbecue fund-raiser. The money raised will be
invested in purchasing environmentally friendly products for
local businesses. After finishing the assignment, Emily
began researching the possibility of making this proposal
into a real community event.
In this example, Emily fully engaged in the assignment
and, through collaboration but also independence, Emily
developed an ambitious idea that she continued developing
even after the assignment was completed. Emily has more
comfortably taken on a number of the actions and expecta-
tions associated with being an inquirer.
Diversification
Once a student has achieved a certain level of comfort and
commitment as an inquiry student, a more complex process
may emerge that involves adopting additional and varied
roles within the classroom. This involves conscious risk-tak-
ing, because it is inherently more complex. There is also a
more complex social component involved when taking on
the role of another person. If one is engaging in another per-
son's role who is in a position of authority (e.g., teacher or
team leader among students), this can also be intimidating
and therefore a disincentive to diversify a role. For example,
the student in addition to a learner role may now also take on
a hypothesizer or explorer role while the teacher may adopt
additional learner or partner roles (Aulls & Ibrahim, 2012).
Comfort with each role on an individual level allows for the
more complex process of diversification to occur.Appropriate
scaffolding from the teacher or from other students is critical
to success here. The teacher is responsible for ensuring that
students will be successful in the roles they adopt. This can
be overwhelming and this process, in particular, often repre-
sents what has been previously conceptualized as the role
shift in inquiry (Aulls & Shore, 2008; Crawford, 2000).
Although the above processes were primarily described from
a student's perspective, teachers may go through a similar
process when engaging in inquiry.
Diversification differs from stabilization because one
may commit to a role simply because it is appealing or enjoy-
able; however, diversification occurs once a student has felt
comfortable enough or has become bored with a particular
role. Diversification and stabilization can therefore overlap.
Within Emily's classroom, the students have been working
on their summative unit activity. In small groups, students
have been asked to prepare a short presentation for a younger
audience about the importance of recycling. The group mem-
bers have collected pertinent information and are now decid-
ing what information to present. As one student is describing
the information she would present, Emily asks her how she
might make the information easier to understand for the
younger audience. The group members then engage in a dis-
cussion about how the information can be meaningfully pre-
sented. This is an example of diversification because Emily
has not only taken on the role of presenter, but she has also
engaged in the role of an audience member by imagining if
someone younger would be able to understand the presented
information. Later, Emily's teacher walks by and asks Emily
to further explain her section of the presentation because this
was something she had never heard before. This is an addi-
tional example of diversification because Emily has taken on
the roles of student and teacher, while the teacher has now
also taken on a learner role.
Social interaction and dialog are key qualities of an inquiry
environment, and they influence the diversification process.
For example, observing other students participating in the
process of diversification might model the process, therefore
possibly facilitating their own diversification process.
Also relevant to inquiry diversification is Turner's (2002)
functionality principle in which there is a distribution of
responsibilities among individuals who adopt different roles
based on their skills, knowledge, and diversity. For example,
in a group, each student may have specific or unique skills,
10 SAGE Open
and with increased decision-making power in inquiry, mem-
bers may decide that each person will adopt a specific role to
accomplish the task, including recorder, investigator, or pre-
senter. In addition, Turner recognized that when individuals
learn about each other's roles, role transitions are facilitated.
This may also apply to adopting new or additional roles.
Thornton and Nardi (1975) recognized the importance of
individual characteristics in their final role-acquisition
phase, the personal phase. They acknowledged variability
within roles due to the influence of expectations from previ-
ous experience, cultural beliefs, and personality. This also
applies to role diversification and influences which addi-
tional roles each student adopts. Diversification differs from
Yellin's (1999) final confidence phase in which roles
become predictable. In an inquiry environment, the stu-
dent's role is always changing because it expands and incor-
porates several different roles. Yellin also accepted that a
predictable role can lead to boredom and decreased motiva-
tion. Focusing on student interest in inquiry somewhat pro-
tects against these problems and facilitates motivation in the
classroom, making it advantageous, especially during diver-
sification (Aulls & Shore, 2008). Diversification is more
consistent with Turner's (2002) interactional theory due to a
role's changing nature as well as the possibility for role cre-
ativity, which becomes a reality during this phase. Turner
also recognized that some roles are resistant to change.
Perhaps this helps explain why some students struggle in
inquiry. If they experience difficulty during any of the above
processes, they may struggle in a setting in which role diver-
sity is embraced.
Conclusion
Theory is important to practice and provides a foundation for
understanding complex phenomena. By reviewing tenets
from role theory and role acquisition, a new or expanded
framework was proposed that included a previously missing
conceptualization, namely, inquiry-role diversification. The
present article offers a theory-based framework to help
understand this process, applying tenets from role theory to a
specific process common in inquiry-based learning environ-
ments, namely, diversification. Better understanding of
inquiry processes is important because inquiry education is
central to numerous, ongoing, curricular reforms. Based on
social-constructivist principles, inquiry can greatly improve
the learning environment. Currently, several inquiry phe-
nomena are not fully understood, including role diversifica-
tion that is frequently observed, but not well described.
Our proposed framework for inquiry roles contains
four processes: exploration, engagement, stabilization,
and diversification. During exploration, implicit and
explicit inquiry classroom rules are learned. Engagement
is characterized by formally adopting and learning spe-
cific role expectations of being an inquirer. Stabilization
is characterized by commitment to being an inquirer.
During diversification, individuals adopt different, addi-
tional roles in the classroom. Limited research has been
conducted on these processes, and the proposed frame-
work provides a previously unavailable conceptualiza-
tion of this complex phenomenon.
Limitations
Although the proposed framework for inquiry roles incorpo-
rated and synthesized several role-related tenets and was
based on role theory, additional empirical evidence examin-
ing each process and its specific characteristics is needed.
Implications
Teachers and students.A deeper understanding of role
diversification can provide teachers and students with a
better sense of success in inquiry environments. Success in
inquiry is measured differently, and not all students always
achieve their full potential in inquiry classrooms. However,
if greater knowledge is gained regarding roles, role acquisi-
tion, and particularly role diversification, then strategies
can be developed to help facilitate transitions for students
who are struggling to adapt to inquiry's role-diversification
challenges.
Furthermore, better understanding of these complex pro-
cesses will help improve evaluation criteria within inquiry.
If students better understand how learning occurs within
inquiry, this may contribute to a sense of empowerment,
rather than frustration in inquiry. For example, if a student is
struggling to meet an assignment deadline, but is working
hard on a topic of interest, this student might be penalized
within a traditional classroom setting. However, in inquiry,
this student could be considered to be experiencing stabili-
zation, a very positive and advanced learning process.
Consultants and educational developers. The proposed frame-
work has multiple implications for school psychologists,
counselors, subject-matter consultants, and other profession-
als because it presents a developmental understanding of a
central phenomenon in inquiry classrooms. Specifically, this
research carries implications for assessment, and in planning
interventions for struggling students. As inquiry becomes
increasingly central to curricula, classroom environments are
changing. The inquiry setting can be quite different from a
traditional classroom; it can often be busy and noisy due to
students' enthusiasm about playing a much more active role
in their learning. Examining student roles in the classroom
and how these might affect learning would be a useful tool
during classroom observations for students with learning
difficulties.
A consultant or educational developer's view of typical
behavior in the classroom might need to be altered consider-
ably in inquiry environments. Typical behavior in inquiry
classrooms (e.g., students actively investigating their own
Walker and Shore 11
educational interests) might be considered inappropriate or
dysfunctional in a traditional classroom setting. Properly com-
prehending inquiry phenomena, for example, role diversifica-
tion, in which the student may take on teachers' roles by
challenging presented information and asking questions, will
lead to a better understanding of what should be considered
appropriate classroom behavior. The same applies to what con-
stitutes success in a classroom. Conditions for success vary
considerably in an inquiry context. Success on an inquiry task
may not be based on the outcome alone, but perhaps also on
how much the student persevered or took on additional roles to
investigate the concept.
In addition, students often act out because they are bored.
Such behavior may be decreased in an inquiry setting in
which learning is shaped by students'interests. Furthermore,
inquiry regularly requires group problem solving and dis-
agreements can therefore occur often, but these can lead to
important social and cognitive gains (Barfurth & Shore,
2008). Such interpersonal disputes should not necessarily be
considered dysfunctional. Overall, the classroom context
has a huge impact on student and teacher behavior.
Researchers.This review has implications for plotting the
growth of inquiry in a classroom, school, or among teachers
and students. For example, if a student is experiencing
increased conflict in the classroom, perhaps this suggests that
the individual is experiencing engagement or even stabiliza-
tion and not necessarily failing or underperforming in the
inquiry setting. In addition, researchers could focus on the four
processes of inquiry in future studies about classroom interac-
tions. For example, it might be possible to develop a qualita-
tive checklist for a classroom observation based on the
descriptions of each process; however, further empirical
research will be required to validate the proposed theoretical
framework.
