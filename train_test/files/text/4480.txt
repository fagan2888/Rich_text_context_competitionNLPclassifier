Introduction
Endothelial cells (ECs) play a crucial role in maintaining
vascular homeostasis,1 and dysfunction of the vascular
endothelium is associated with the pathogenesis of cardio-
vascular diseases.2 Moreover, compelling evidence has
implicated dysfunctional ECs in the development of dia-
betic vascular diseases,3,4 the significance of which is
underscored by the World Health Organization's estimate
that there are currently 422million patients with diabetes
worldwide.5 The classical in vitro model of diabetes devel-
opment comprises the induction of endothelial dysfunction
by high glucose (HG) levels. Therefore, understanding the
molecular mechanism by which vascular EC dysfunction
arises under HG conditions may be useful for both the pre-
vention and treatment of diabetic vascular complications.
Many reports have shown that calcium is an important
regulator of endothelial function in diabetes,6­8 and
mitochondria constitute one of the largest intracellular
calcium pools. However, the key signalling events linking

Abstract
Objective: Mitochondrial Ca2+ overload is implicated in hyperglycaemia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction, but the
key molecular events responsible remain unclear. We examined the involvement of mitochondrial calcium uniporter,
which mediates mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, in endothelial cell dysfunction resulting from high-glucose treatment.
Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were exposed to various glucose concentrations and to high glucose
(30mM) following mitochondrial calcium uniporter inhibition or activation with ruthenium red and spermine, respectively.
Subsequently, mitochondrial calcium uniporter and mitochondrial calcium uniporter regulator 1 messenger RNA and
protein expression was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Ca2+ concentrations
were analysed by laser confocal microscopy, and cytoplasmic and mitochondrial oxidative stress was detected using
2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and MitoSOX Red, respectively. Apoptosis was assessed by annexin V-fluorescein
isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining, and a wound-healing assay was performed using an in vitro model.
Results: High glucose markedly upregulated mitochondrial calcium uniporter and mitochondrial calcium uniporter
regulator 1 messenger RNA expression, as well as protein production, in a dose- and time-dependent manner with a
maximum effect demonstrated at 72h and 30mM glucose concentration. Moreover, high-glucose treatment significantly
raised both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species levels, increased apoptosis and compromised
wound healing (all p<0.05). These effects were enhanced by spermine and completely negated by ruthenium red, which
are known to activate and inhibit mitochondrial calcium uniporter, respectively.
Conclusion: Mitochondrial calcium uniporter plays an important role in hyperglycaemia-induced endothelial cell
dysfunction and may constitute a therapeutic target to reduce vascular complications in diabetes.

hyperglycaemia with mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration in
ECs are not known. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter
(MCU) is the pore-forming subunit of the Ca2+ uniporter
ion channel located on the mitochondrial inner membrane
that mediates Ca2+ uptake into the matrix, regulating
cytoplasmic Ca2+ signalling.9­11 MCU is essential for glu-
cose-induced increases in adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
concentration in pancreatic -cells,12 and its knockdown
reduces agonist- and depolarization-induced mitochon-
drial Ca2+ sequestration, ATP production, and d-glucose-
stimulated insulin secretion.13 However, the role of MCU
in hyperglycaemia-induced EC dysfunction has not been
explored.
We propose that MCU is the critical protein responsible
for mitochondrial Ca2+ overload in EC dysfunction caused
by hyperglycaemia. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter reg-
ulator 1 (MCUR1) is also essential for the formation of
MCU complex and may regulate its function, enabling
mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and the maintenance of normal
cellular bioenergetics.14 Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
overproduction, increased apoptosis and compromised
wound-healing ability contribute to the development of
pathological conditions associated with endothelial dys-
function.15,16 Thus, in this study, we used human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to investigate the
involvement of MCU and MCUR1 in hyperglycaemia-
induced mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, ROS overproduc-
tion, apoptosis and decreased wound-healing ability.
Materials and methods
Cell culture and treatment
HUVECs were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and were cultured in low-
glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)
containing 10% foetal bovine serum, 100U/L penicillin and
100U/L streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO2
. Cells of passages
3­7 were used for experiments. As described in previous
studies, the cells were treated with different concentrations
of glucose (2, 5.5, 10, 20 and 30mM) for 72h and exposed to
HG (30mM) for different lengths of time (0, 12, 24, 48 and
72h).17,18 Treatment with 5.5
mM glucose was considered
the `normal glucose' (NG) condition. Once the optimal glu-
cose exposure time and concentration had been established,
experiments involving 30-min pre-treatment with the MCU
inhibitor ruthenium red (RR; 0.2
mM) (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA) or MCU activator spermine (sper; 2mM) (Sigma)
were carried out. As an osmotic control, treatment with
24.5mM mannitol (Mnt) and 5.5mM glucose was used.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was isolated from HUVECs using Total RNA
Kit I (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA, USA) and reverse
transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) with a
ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix with gDNA Remover
kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). In all, 50-ng samples of this
cDNA were then subjected to real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) on a Mastercycler nexus X2 PCR
System (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using SYBR
Green I and TaqMan probes and primers targeting MCU
(forward: TTCACCTCTTCTGGGAGCAG; reverse:
TCCAGGATCTTGACCAATGCT), MCUR1 (forward:
ATTCCTGGGACATCATGGAG; reverse: TGTCTGT
CTCTGGCTTCTGG) and -actin (forward: GAGAC
CTTCAACACCCCAG; reverse: TCAGGTCCCGGCC
AGCCA). Values for each unknown were determined by
the 2-Ct method, using -actin as a reference sequence
and standard curves derived from samples of known RNA
quantities.
Western blotting
Total protein extracts (30
µg) were electrophoresed on a
10% sodium dodecyl sulphate­polyacrylamide gel. The
separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, which was
blocked with a 5% skimmed milk solution for 2h at 25°C
and incubated with primary antibodies against MCU and
MCUR1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; 1:500) overnight at
4°C. After washing, the blots were incubated with a goat
anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
secondary antibody (Abcam; 1:3000) for 2
h at 25°C.
Antigen­antibody complexes were visualized using ECL
Western Blotting Detection Reagents and an ImageQuant
350 instrument (GE Healthcare, Marlborough, MA, USA).
Once stripped, the membranes were further probed with an
antibody against -actin as a loading control. Greyscale
values were calculated from blots using ImageJ software.
Measurement of [Ca2+]mito and [Ca2+]cyt by
laser confocal microscopy
Changes in [Ca2+]mito and [Ca2+]cyt were detected by
incubating HUVECs for 30min at 37°C in the dark with the
Ca2+ indicators Rhod-2 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene,
OR, USA) and Fluo-3 AM (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China) at
final concentrations of 2 and 5µmol/L, respectively. After
incubation, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) and analysed by capturing fluores-
cence images using a confocal microscope equipped with
an argon­krypton laser. Fluorescence deriving from Rhod-2
AM and Fluo-3 AM was assessed with 559/578 and
488/515nm excitation/emission filters, respectively.
Intracellular ROS measurement
Intracellular ROS levels were measured using the
2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) assay. After
treatment, HUVECs were stained with 10
µM DCF-DA
(Beyotime, Haimen, China) for 30
min at 37°C in the dark,
before being washed twice with PBS. ROS production was
then assessed using a fluorescent microscope (Nikon, Tokyo,
496 Diabetes & Vascular Disease Research 14(6)
Japan) with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) green filter
set (485/535
nm excitation/emission). Fluorescence intensi-
ties were determined using ImageJ software.
Measurement of mitochondrial O
2
- levels
Changes in mitochondrial O
2
- levels were measured using
MitoSOX Red (Yeasen, Shanghai, China), which targets
mitochondria and fluoresces when oxidized by O
2
- .
Subcultured HUVECs were loaded with MitoSOX Red,
which was dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO)
and used at a final concentration of 5
µmol/L, for 30
min
at 37°C in the dark, and washed twice with PBS.
Mitochondrial O
2
- levels were then assessed using a fluo-
rescence microscope with 510 and 580nm excitation and
emission filters, respectively, and fluorescence intensities
were determined using ImageJ software.
Flow cytometric analysis of EC apoptosis
To quantify HUVEC viability, cells were stained with both
annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) using an Annexin
V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The proportion of apoptotic cells was deter-
mined using a FACSAria instrument (BD Biosciences).
Wound-healing assay
HUVECs were plated on six-well plates and grown over-
night to near confluence. A cell-free area was made in each
well by scraping a 10
µL pipette tip across the cells, and
culture was then continued. Images were taken 0, 18 and
36h after creating the wounds, and cells migrating into the
cell-free space were quantified.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as means±SEM. Comparisons between
more than two groups were performed using one-way anal-
ysis of variances (ANOVAs) and a post hoc Tukey test.
Comparisons between two groups were performed using
unpaired t-test. p-values <0.05 were considered statistically
significant. When individual studies are demonstrated, there
are representative of at least three independent studies.
Results
Effects of glucose on MCU and MCUR1
expression in HUVECs
As shown in Figure 1, the lowest glucose concentration
used (2
mM) slightly elevated MCU and MCUR1 mes-
senger RNA(mRNA) and protein expression in HUVECs,
although this effect was not statistically significant.
However, HG significantly increased both the mRNA
and protein levels of MCU and MCUR1 in these cells
(p<0.05) in a time-dependent manner. These levels were
highest using 30mM glucose for 72h (p<0.05).
Effects of glucose on calcium and ROS levels in
HUVECs
[Ca2+]mito and [Ca2+]cyt were significantly elevated in
cells of the HG group (p<0.05) (Figure 2(a)). Moreover,
total ROS and mitochondrial O
2
- levels in HUVECs
treated with HG were remarkably higher than in cells
exposed to the NG and Mnt condition (p<0.05) (Figure
2(b)). There was no significant difference in [Ca2+]mito,
[Ca2+]cyt, total ROS and mitochondrial O
2
- levels between
NG and Mnt group (p>
0.05) (Figure 2).Thus, HG not
only increased the expression of MCU and MCUR1 but
also resulted in heightened calcium and oxidative stress
levels in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of HUVECs.
Effects of glucose on HUVEC apoptosis and
wound healing
As shown in Figure 3(a), HUVEC apoptosis increased sig-
nificantly following treatment with HG for 72
h. In addi-
tion, the degree of wound closure in the HG group was
significantly lower than that in the NG and Mnt groups
(Figure 3(b)). There was no significant difference in apop-
tosis and wound healing between NG and Mnt groups
(p>0.05) (Figure 3). These results suggest that HG expo-
sure can impair ECs function.
Role of MCU in hyperglycaemia induced
increase in HUVEC calcium and ROS levels
To explore the role of MCU in calcium and ROS changes in
ECs during hyperglycaemia, HUVECs were pre-treated for
30min with RR or sper, which inhibits and activates MCU,
respectively, and exposed to HG for 72
h. [Ca2+]mito was
significantly reduced in the HG+RR group and elevated in
the HG
+
sper group (p<
0.05) (Figure 4(a)); however,
[Ca2+]cyt did not significantly differ following these treat-
ments, compared to the HG group.As shown in Figure 4(b),
in comparison with HUVECs treated with HG only, total
ROS and mitochondrial O
2
-
levels were significantly lower
in cells treated HG+RR, and significantly higher in those
exposed to HG+sper. These results demonstrate that MCU
plays a crucial role in hyperglycaemia-induced mitochon-
drial calcium overload and oxidative stress in HUVECs.
Roles of MCU in hyperglycaemia induced
HUVEC apoptosis and compromised wound-
healing ability
As shown in Figure 5(a), compared to the HG group, apop-
tosis was less frequent among HUVECs treated with
Chen et al. 497
HG+
RR and more frequent among those administered
HG+sper. Also in comparison with the HG-treated group,
gap closure was significantly accelerated and retarded by
HG+
RR and HG
+
sper treatment, respectively. These
data indicate that MCU exerts an important effect on hyper-
glycaemia-induced EC apoptosis and wound healing.
Discussion
Mitochondrial Ca2+ overload has been implicated as a criti-
cal mediator of cellular dysfunction under hyperglycaemic
conditions,7 but the key signalling events linking hypergly-
caemia with increased mitochondrial Ca2+ have so far
remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate for the first time
that hyperglycaemia-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ overload
depends on MCU activation, leading to increased mitochon-
drial ROS levels and HUVEC dysfunction.
First, our results showed that HG increased HUVEC
MCU and MCUR1 expression at transcriptional and trans-
lational levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
Moreover, HG resulted in elevated Ca2+ and ROS levels
in these cells, increased their rate of apoptosis and

compromised their wound-healing ability. Hyperglycaemia
was thus found to induce EC dysfunction, as reported in
previous studies.16,19 Furthermore, our data suggest that
MCU and MCUR1 are upregulated in ECs after HG expo-
sure, providing evidence for the role of the MCU complex
in diabetic vascular diseases.
MCU is a mitochondrial inner membrane uniporter that
mediates mitochondrial uptake of Ca2+ and controls its con-
centration within this organelle.20 Previous studies have
shown that excessive mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake has delete-
rious effects, including ROS overproduction,21 sensitization
to apoptosis,22 and activation of the permeability transition
pore and subsequent cell death pathways.23,24 Our results
demonstrate that hyperglycaemia results in increased MCU
expression and impaired cell function. However, little is
known of the significance of MCU in HG-induced EC dys-
function. In order to address this gap in our knowledge, we
exposed HUVECs to an inhibitor or an activator of MCU
prior to HG treatment. The Ca2+ overload, heightened oxi-
dative stress, increased apoptosis rate and decreased wound-
healing ability induced by hyperglycaemia, and these effects
were negated by MCU inhibition. Conversely, the MCU
activator spermine was found to exacerbate HG-induced EC
dysfunction. These results support the conclusion that MCU
is clearly an important mediator of the detrimental effects of
HG on EC function.
Consistent with previous results,25,26 we found MCU to
be associated with oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.
Knocking down endogenous MCU has been shown to
decrease mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and attenuate the death
of HeLa cells and primary cerebellar granule neurons result-
ing from oxidative stress.25 In addition, Sripetchwandee
et al.26 established that iron overload could result in cardiac
mitochondrial dysfunction, including increased ROS pro-
duction, membrane depolarization and swelling, and showed
that these effects could be prevented by MCU blockers.
MCU is also necessary for store-operated Ca2+ entry-
dependent breast cancer cell migration.27 Our results con-
firm an essential role for MCU in the Ca2+ overload that
leads to deleterious consequences for ECs. However, further
investigation is required to identify the signalling pathways
downstream of MCU involved in EC dysfunction.
To conclude, our study suggests that hyperglycaemia
results in enhanced expression of MCU and MCUR1,
leading to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. Subsequent
excessive generation of ROS due to heightened mitochon-
drial activity may then eventually cause endothelial dys-
function. We propose that MCU plays an important role in
