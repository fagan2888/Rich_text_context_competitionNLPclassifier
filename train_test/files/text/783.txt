OBJECTIVE: To determine familial risk ratios for extreme obesity to aid in the design of obesity linkage studies.
DESIGN: Family study of obesity
SUBJECTS: 2349 ®rst-degree relatives (parents and siblings) of 840 probands who are members of the National
Association to Advance Fat Acceptance (NAAFA) and 5851 participants of the ®rst phase of the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey III.
METHODS: Computed age±gender standardized risk ratios (SRRs) for obesity in relatives categorized by the level of
obesity in the index case (proband).
MEASUREMENT: Body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2)
RESULTS: The risk of extreme obesity (BMI ! 40) in relatives of extremely obese women (BMI ! 40) was more than ®ve
times greater than in the population; furthermore, the risk of obesity in relatives was approximately linearly
associated with the degree of obesity in the proband. The risk of thinness in relatives of obese individuals was
substantially lower than in the general population.
CONCLUSION: Because the familial risk ratio for extreme obesity is higher than for moderate levels of obesity, the
number of families required to achieve adequate statistical power in gene mapping studies of obesity can be reduced
substantially by focusing on family members of extremely obese individuals (BMI ! 40).

Introduction
Traditional methods in genetic epidemiology, such as
family, twin and adoption studies have identi®ed
genetic susceptibility as a major contributing factor
to the familial aggregation of obesity;1 these studies
have provided the impetus for a new area of investi-
gation designed to map and characterize genes which
predispose humans to be obese. The identi®cation of
such genes will be challenging, in large part because
the expression of obesity may depend on numerous
factors: multiple obesity-susceptibility loci (and their
potential interactions), reduced penetrance and envir-
onmental variables such as availability of a calorically
dense diet. Several segregation studies report results
that are consistent with major gene in¯uence on
obesity.1,2,3 Although some genes eventually may be
found to have large effects on some obesity pheno-
types in humans, already more than 70 genes or
chromosome regions have been implicated as having
some role in obesity in humans or animal models.4
The dif®culties facing studies designed to identify
obesity-susceptibility genes in humans are evident
from the inconsistencies in results across studies.
Differences may be due to:
(1) actual locus heterogeneity (for example, differ-
ent genes or combinations of genes leading to
obesity in different populations);
(2) inadequate statistical power to detect poly-
genic loci with small effects (high rates of false
negatives);
(3) low prior probability that any particular gene will
have a measurable effect in a particular sample
(high rates of false positives) or
(4) environmental heterogeneity (for example,
differences in exposure to risk and protective
factors).
Furthermore, it has been shown that replication of
susceptibility loci for a complex trait requires a longer
period of time (for example, a larger sample size) than
the initial detection of linkage.5
Given these challenges facing linkage studies of
obesity, it is necessary to employ a study design that
maximizes the feasibility of localizing obesity-sus-
ceptibility loci and that allows for replication of those
®ndings. Risch6 has shown that, for both monogenic
and polygenic traits, models of inheritance can be
examined by computing a risk ratio, which compares
the prevalence of a trait in relatives with the preva-
lence of the trait in the population. The more extreme
the risk ratio, the more likely a gene for a trait will be

detected, with risk ratios b 5 suggesting possible
major-gene inheritance. It is clear that prevalence of
moderate levels of obesity in families ascertained
through an extremely obese member is high;7,8 how-
ever, the speci®c familial and population rates have
not been reported and it has been unclear whether the
prevalence of extreme obesity in relatives increases as
the obesity in the proband increases. In this paper, we
determined obesity risk ratios using a sample ascer-
tained through extremely obese probands and consid-
ered practical implications for selecting obesity
thresholds for a linkage study.
Materials and methods
Subjects
We recruited members of the National Association to
Advance Fat Acceptance (NAAFA). We asked mem-
bers to provide height and weight for themselves and
for their ®rst-degree relatives. The members of
NAAFA were mostly female, Caucasian and college
educated. A detailed description of the participants
has been reported previously.8
Obesity index
We used body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) as an index
of obesity.
Age and gender standardization of obesity prevalence
and risk ratios
To compute age and gender standardized prevalence
rates,9 we created six categories: three age categories
(20±34 y, 35±59 y and ! 60 y) for each gender. We
then applied an equal weight of 1/6 to the prevalence
rate for each age±gender category to standardize the
age distribution in the two populations. The weighted,
age±gender speci®c prevalence rates for all ®rst-
degree relatives (parents and siblings) of NAAFA
probands were totaled and compared with those
obtained from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) data. In our analysis,
we restricted the NHANES group to the Caucasian
subjects who enrolled in the ®rst phase of NHANES
III and were examined in mobile examination clinics
because they were ascertained at the comparable time
period (between August 1991 and January 1992) as
our study subjects. 10,11
Risk ratios were calculated by dividing the age and
gender standardized obesity prevalence rates in the
relatives of probands, by the age and gender standar-
dized obesity prevalence rates in the NHANES III
subjects, yielding a standardized risk ratio (SRR).
Standard errors were approximated by 1/b[(p(1 7 p)/
n], where b is the baseline risk of reaching the obesity
threshold in the population, p is the proportion of
relatives who reached the threshold, and n is the total
number of relatives in the group. To compute standard
errors, we assumed family members are independent
and the prevalence rates from the NHANES data are
constants. Con®dence intervals based on the approxi-
mated standard errors are anti-conservative and
should be considered minimal.
Grouping probands by body mass index (BMI)
thresholds to compute standardized risk ratios
We grouped proband BMI in two ways. We ®rst used
three ascending, non-overlapping thresholds of obe-
sity in probands (BMIs: 30±39, 40±44 and ! 45) to
determine whether the risk of obesity in relatives
increases with the obesity of the proband (Interval
method). We then used three ascending overlapping
thresholds of proband obesity (BMI ! 30, BMI ! 40
and BMI ! 45) to assess the overall impact on study
design of ascertaining families through probands
exceeding various obesity thresholds (Threshold
method). We used these thresholds to de®ne obesity
in the relatives as well. The thresholds correspond to
the 78th, 89th and 99th percentiles in the general
population, respectively, and denote moderate to
extreme levels of obesity.
Calculation of standardized risk ratios for thinness
We computed age and gender speci®c SRR for thin-
ness in relatives (BMI 20) to determine if thinness
in relatives was negatively correlated with the degree
of obesity in the proband. Less than 8% of the general
adult population has BMI 20.
Accuracy of self-reported BMI
For a subset of probands (n  11) and their relatives
(n  30), we measured their height and weight to
assess the accuracy of informant's reported values.
We computed a Pearson's correlation coef®cient
between the measured and reported values for heights
and weights.
Results
Of the 2444 questionnaires given to NAAFA subjects,
981 (39%) were completed and returned. Respondents
were excluded from further analysis if they were
adopted, male or had a BMI ` 30. The remaining
840 respondents (probands) provided information on
their 2349 relatives. We restricted our analysis to
relatives whose ages ranged between 20 and 74 y to
match subjects in the NHANES sample.

degree of obesity in the probands (Figure 1). Moderate
obesity (BMI ! 30) was signi®cantly more common in
the relatives of obese probands than in the population
and increased with proband BMI (SRR  1.5, 1.6 and
2.0 for probands with BMI 30±39, 40±44 and ! 45,
respectively). Extreme obesity in the relatives
(BMI ! 45) was much more prevalent than in the
population and increased substantially with BMI of
the proband (SRR  3.5, 4.6 and 7.7 for probands with
a BMI between 30±39, 40±44 and ! 45, respectively).
The familial risk ratio for thinness (de®ned as a
BMI 20) showed an inverse relationship with the
probands' BMI. That is, for probands with a BMI
30±39, 40±44 and ! 45, the familial risk ratios were
1.0, 0.7 and 0.6, respectively.
Age±gender standardized prevalence rates of obesity
among the relatives of extremely obese women and in
the general population: Grouping probands by BMI
threshold
Table 1 and Figure 2 provide age±gender standardized
prevalence rates of obesity for ascending thresholds of
obesity in relatives and the corresponding prevalence
rates in the general population. Age±gender standar-
dardized population prevalence rates, determined
from the NHANES sample, were 7.5% for
BMI 20, 21.4% for BMI ! 30, 2.4% for BMI ! 40
and 1.0% for BMI ! 45 (Table 1). Moderate levels of
obesity (BMI ! 30) were common in the general
population; however, in the families of extremely
obese women, the prevalence rates of obesity were
approximately twice as high as that in the general
population (37.7±42.2% vs 21.4%). Increasing the
obesity threshold to BMI ! 40 in the relatives of the
extremely obese women resulted in a more than ®ve-
fold increase in the prevalence rates of obesity com-
pared with the rate in the general population (11.8±
15.1% vs 2.4%). When the most extreme obesity
threshold was used (BMI ! 45), the prevalence rates
were nearly eight times that of the general population
(6.1±8.0% vs 1.0%).

bands with extreme obesity vs the rates in the population. For
three ascending thresholds of obesity, we computed SRRs,
strati®ed by three ascending non-overlapping thresholds of
BMI in probands (Interval method). Thinness in relatives was
de®ned as BMI 20.

Accuracy of reported BMI
The recall of height and weight for the relatives of a
subset of probands was reasonably accurate:
rBMI
 0.89, z  8.8, P ` 0.01. As expected, we
observed a systematic underreporting of weight, on
average by about 4 kg (10 lb) and an overreporting of
height, on average about 2.5 cm (1 in). The net effect
is a systematic underreporting of BMI that would have
little effect on the placement of individuals in the BMI
threshold categories.
Discussion
The familial risk ratio for obesity increased approxi-
mately linearly with the probands' BMI, and the risk
of extreme obesity in relatives of extremely obese
probands (BMI ! 40) was more than ®ve-fold higher
than in the general population. Selecting families
through extremely obese probands with BMI ! 40
appears to provide a balance between the competing
needs of gene mapping studies: a high familial risk
ratio and a suf®ciently high population prevalence to
make family ascertainment feasible.
Risk ratios and statistical power in obesity gene
mapping
Risch12 extended the work of James13 and proposed
that the recurrence risk in relatives (approximated by
SRR in this paper) conveniently provides an estimate
for statistical power to detect linkage in studies
involving affected relative pairs. Our ®ndings support
the usefulness of the l in genetic studies of obesity.
It is possible to maximise the ef®ciency of a gene
mapping study design by concentrating on probands
with extreme obesity (BMI ! 40). Risch6 has sug-
gested that for phenotypic traits with risk ratios b 5,
the potential exists for a large proportion of the trait
variation to be accounted for by a major gene. For a l
of 5.0, 186 sib pairs are needed to detect linkage
(assuming two genes contributing equally and addi-
tively, 80% power, one-sided alpha of 0.0001, PIC
(polymorphism information content14) of 0.8, markers
10 cM apart); however, for a l of 2.5, more than twice
as many pairs are needed to generate comparable
levels of statistical power.12 Therefore, selecting
pairs of relatives with higher familial risk ratios
increased the statistical power to detect linkage.
Allison et al15 applied the l statistic to ®ne gene
mapping in obesity to determine the required sample
size to localize putative genes. Using the data from
published and simulation studies, the authors con-
cluded that ls for milder forms of obesity were
disappointingly low. This observation led to the pre-
diction that an impractically large number of sibling
pairs would be necessary to achieve adequate statis-
tical power to detect linkage for obesity related genes.
In the current study, we examine ways to improve
statistical power in obesity linkage studies. We
showed that the statistical power can be increased
by studying family members with extreme obesity
(BMI ! 40). If one posits a ®ve gene model (assuming
®ve genes contributing equally and additively, mar-
kers 10 cM apart and PIC of 0.8), with a familial risk
ratio of 5.0, approximately 569 affected sibling pairs
would be needed to detect linkage at 80% power at a
one-sided P-value of 0.001 and 767 afftected sibling
pairs for one-sided P-value of 0.0001.12,16 Even
though these numbers are large, they represent sig-
ni®cantly smaller sample sizes than those required
when families with more modest levels of obesity are
ascertained.
Although the bene®ts of studying more extremely
affected probands and their families are straightfor-
ward, the rarity of the subjects make them dif®cult to
recruit; therefore, a balance has to be achieved
between the decreased need to recruit large numbers
of subjects and the increased effort needed to ascertain
individuals with more extreme phenotypes. To illus-
trate this point, we employed an analysis similar to
that used by Todorov et al17 and found the costs of
screening and ascertaining a family doubles as the
minimum proband BMI is raised from 40 to 45. Thus,
selecting families through probands with BMI ! 40
appears to be the best compromise.
The method of examining extremely discordant
sibling pairs has been advocated as a powerful
method to map genes for complex traits,16 but it
may be a dif®cult analytical method for obesity
Figure 2 Age and gender standardized risk ratios (SRRs), com-
paring the prevalence rates of obesity in relatives of probands
with extreme obesity vs the population prevalence rates of
obesity. Ascending overlapping thresholds of obesity of body
mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) were used to de®ne moderate to
extreme levels of obesity in the ®rst-degree relatives (Threshold
method). Thinness in relatives was de®ned as BMI 20.
Risk ratios for extreme obesity

when extremely obese probands are ascertained.18 In
addition to the relative scarcity of subjects with a
BMI ! 40, the likelihood that such subjects will have
a thin family member is lower than one would expect,
based upon population rates. For extremely obese
probands, the probability of having a thin ®rst-
degree relative (BMI 20), was nearly half the gen-
eral population prevalence rate and this further adds to
the dif®culty of subject recruitment for sibling pairs
with extremely discordant BMIs. Without thin sib-
lings, however, families become less informative to
detect linkage. As recently suggested, it may be
possible to overcome some of these inherent dif®cul-
ties by raising the threshold for thin relatives to the
lower 30% (BMI 24).19
The familial risk ratio provides a heritability index
for traits, and it assumes the shared family environ-
ment has a negligible in¯uence on the familial aggre-
gation of the trait. This assumption, as it pertains to
obesity, has been comprehensively reviewed by Grilo
and Pogue-Geile,20 who concluded that shared family
environment has little, if any, effect on the aggrega-
tion of obesity within families. So to the extent that
familial risk ratios give accurate estimates of genetic
susceptibility, our data demonstrate that extreme obe-
sity is more heritable than moderate levels of obesity.
This conclusion is further supported by the work of
Laskarzewski et al,21 who compared the rates of
obesity among families of probands in the upper and
lower tertiles of weight-for-height and found the rates
of obesity to be much higher in the families with an
obese proband. MacLean and Rhode22 also observed
an increased risk of obesity in relatives of patients
with extreme obesity by comparing the proportion of
proband families that have any relative with BMI ! 40
against control families (odds ratio  24.5; 95% CI,
10.4±57.7). Because the unit of analysis in that paper
is family rather than individual, it is not a reasonable
estimator of l.
We ascertained families with extreme obesity
through members of NAAFA which led to an ascer-
tainment of probands which are over 90% female.
Although we restricted our analysis to relatives of
female probands, we included both male and female
relatives of female probands. The familial risk ratios
in female relatives are comparable to those in male
relatives (data not shown). Because extreme obesity is
less common in men than in women, we predict that
familial risk ratios would be higher than the observed
familial risk ratios if we had ascertained male pro-
bands, selected for comparable BMI values and their
relatives.
Accuracy of reported BMI
We used reported values of heights and weights,
rather than measured values. Several studies have
shown that self-reported values of heights and weights
are comparable to those measured.23,24,25 In a subset
of families, we compared the reported values of
heights and weights against the measured values,
and found the correlation to be reasonably high.
As expected, we observed a systematic bias in
that respondents underreport BMI. If the results
can be generalized to all subjects in our study,
the actual risk in ®rst-degree relatives should be
higher than the estimated risk based on the reported
BMIs.
Conclusion
We observed that the risk of obesity in relatives
increased proportionally with the proband BMI, with
more extremely obese probands having relatives with
more extreme phenotypes. These results suggest that
genetic in¯uences are stronger in extreme obesity than
in moderate levels of obesity. In genetic studies of
obesity, statistical power can be increased by ascer-
taining families through probands with extreme obe-
sity, with a BMI ! 40 providing a good balance
between a high familial risk ratio and a high enough
population prevalence to make family recruitment
feasible. Because the prevalence of thinness was low
in relatives of extremely obese probands, the extreme
discordant sibling pair method may require raising the
threshold for thin relatives.
