Abstract
Background: Between 5% and 30% of children in high-income countries live with a substance misusing parent, the majority of
which is below dependent levels. However, little is understood about the impact of nondependent parental substance misuse
upon children. Methods: We searched the international literature using rigorous systematic methods to identify studies
examining parental substance misuse and adverse outcomes in children. The inclusion criteria were cross-sectional, longitudinal,
case-control, and cohort studies; of children aged 0­18 years whose parents are high-risk substance misusers; reporting on their
health, psychological, substance use, educational, and social outcomes. Results: We identified 36 papers (from 33 unique studies),
most of which were assessed as being of medium to high methodological quality (N¼ 28). Parental nondependent substance
misuse was found to be associated with adversity in children, with strong evidence of an association with externalizing difficulties
(N ¼ 7 papers, all finding an association) and substance use (N ¼ 23 papers, all finding an association) in adolescents and some
evidence of adverse health outcomes in early childhood (N ¼ 6/8 papers finding an association). There is less evidence of an
association between parental substance misuse and adverse educational and social outcomes. The body of evidence was largest
for parental alcohol misuse, with research examining the impact of parental illicit drug use being limited. Conclusion: Metho-
dological limitations restrict our ability to make causal inference. Nonetheless, the prevalence of adverse outcomes in children
whose parents are nondependent substance misusers highlights the need for practitioners to intervene with this population
before a parent has developed substance dependency.

Parental substance misuse is a prevalent and substantial child
protection concern worldwide (Canfield, Radcliffe, Marlow,
Boreham, & Gilchrist, 2017; HM Government, 2015). There
is well-established evidence documenting the harmful effect of
parental substance dependency has upon the child throughout
their life course (Cleaver, Unell, & Aldgate, 2011). Children
whose parents are dependent upon substances are more likely
to suffer an injury (Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs,
2003; Bijur, Kurzon, Overpeck, & Schieidt, 1992), as well as
an injury of greater severity (Damashek, Williams, Sher, &
Peterson, 2009) and experience health problems which their
parents may not respond effectively to (Cleaver et al., 2011).
Preschool children are at risk of delays in cognitive and lan-
guage development (Barnard, 2007) and greater likelihood of
education deficits (Royal College of Physicians, 1995). They
go on to have lower educational performance in adolescence
(Kolar, Brown, Haertzen, & Michaelson, 1994), resulting in
poor life chances (Cleaver et al., 2011). Parental substance
dependency has been found to negatively affect the structures
and functions of the family (Velleman & Templeton, 2007).
This includes disrupting family routines and rituals (Holland,

Forrester, Williams, & Copello, 2014), affecting the quality of
the relationship between the parent and the child (Cleaver et al.,
2011), lower levels of parent­child supervision (Kandel, 1990),
harsh parenting (Kelley, Lawreence, Milletich, Hollis, &
Henson, 2015), higher prevalence of domestic violence and
other traumatic events (Sprang, Staton-Tindall, & Clark,
2008), and family deprivation (Holland et al., 2014).
Many factors have been highlighted as possible mechanisms
that impact upon the child, these include direct exposure to
alcohol and/or drug use and to other users (Advisory Council
on the Misuse of Drugs, 2003), ineffective parenting practices
and a reduction in parenting capacity brought about by the
intoxicating effect of the substance and/or withdrawal from it
(Kandel, 1990; Miller, Smyth, & Mudar, 1999), and a lack of
parental emotional availability and warmth (Suchman, Roun-
saville, DeCoste, & Luthar, 2007) as well as greater likelihood
of experiencing trauma such as abuse or neglect as a child
(Dube et al., 2001). Due to the potential negative impact on
the child, parental substance dependence is often identified as a
risk factor in child welfare and child protection assessments. In
England, 18% of all children in need assessments identify
parental drug misuse and 19% identify parental alcohol misuse
(Department for Education, 2016). In the United States, par-
ental substance misuse has been associated with up to two
thirds of all child maltreatment cases (Traube, 2012).
It has been estimated that 162,000 children (1%) in England
may live with a dependent opiate-using parent (Department for
Work and Pensions, 2017) and between 189,119 (1%) and
207,617 (2%) children who live with an alcohol-dependent
parent (Pryce et al., 2017). A far larger number of children are
likely to live with substance-misusing parents whose use does
not meet the diagnostic criteria for dependence. Research esti-
mates that between 5% and 30% of children in European coun-
tries live with at least one parent who misuses substances
(European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
[EMCDDA], 2010), 10.5% of children in the United States, and
13% of children in Australia (Dawe et al., 2007). In the United
Kingdom, 30% of children aged under 16 years live with at
least one parent who misuses alcohol and 8% with a parent who
misuses illicit drugs (Manning, Best, Faulkner, & Titherington,
2009). Moreover, 14% of UK infants (aged under 1 year) are
exposed to parental problem, drinking, or illicit drug misuse
(Manning, 2011), while U.S. research estimates 13% of moth-
ers are misusing alcohol 1 year after delivery (Liu, Mumford, &
Petras, 2015).
Study Objectives
Despite the high prevalence of parental substance misuse that is
below the diagnostic criteria for dependence, little is under-
stood about the impact of such patterns of parental substance
misuse upon children. As the number of children living with a
substance-misusing parent is higher than those living with
a substance-dependent parent, the greatest burden of harm on
a population level is likely to be experienced by these children.
The furthering of knowledge in this area is fundamental to
enable effective and early responses to address the needs of
the families affected. This rapid evidence assessment reviews
published evidence reporting on adverse health, psychological,
substance use, educational, and social outcomes of children of
nondependent substance-misusing parents. We limit our review
to high-risk patterns of parental substance misuse.
Method
The international literature was searched in November 2016
using electronic databases Medline (OVID), PsychoINFO
(OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), SCOPUS, Applied Social Sci-
ence Index and Abstract (ProQuest), International Bibliogra-
phy of Social Science (ProQuest), ProQuest Criminal Justice
(ProQuest), ProQuest Social Science Journals (ProQuest),
ProQuest Sociology (ProQuest), Social Service Abstracts (Pro-
Quest), and Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest). Due to popula-
tion flux and changes in economic conditions, we restricted our
search for evidence to publications from 1998 onward. A
search strategy using mesh terms, thesaurus headings, Boolean,
and proximity operators was adapted for each database and
implemented.
Review Inclusion Criteria
Two researchers independently screened all titles and abstracts
using specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, retrieving full
articles for all potentially eligible studies and evaluating in full
text. Discrepancies at each stage were resolved by discussion or
by consulting a third researcher if consensus could not be
reached. Studies adopting a cross-sectional, longitudinal,
case-control, and cohort design were included if the sample
consisted of children aged 0­18 years whose parents were
high-risk substance misusers. To be included, studies must
report on parental substance misuse that meets one of the fol-
lowing criteria:
 a pattern of alcohol consumption that leads to the pres-
ence of physical or psychological problems (typically
over 35 units per week for women and over 50 units per
week for men);
 frequent illicit drug misuse (more than once per month
as defined by the Crime Survey for England and Wales);
and
 alcohol or illicit drug abuse defined as a maladaptive
pattern of drinking/drug use, leading to clinically signif-
icant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least
one related problem in a 12-month period (failure to
fulfill major role obligations, use in situations in which
it is physically hazardous, alcohol or drug-related legal
problems, having persistent or recurrent social or inter-
personal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects
of alcohol or drugs; American Psychiatric Association,
2013).
Further, studies were required to include comparison sam-
ples of children whose parents were not substance misusers.
2 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE XX(X)
The condition of interest was adversity experienced by the
child defined as any negative health, psychological, child sub-
stance use, educational, and social effect. A health harm
includes direct impact (e.g., brought about by accidental inges-
tion by the child or exposure to the substance or contaminated
environments) or indirect impacts (e.g., child physical injury,
health service usage, fatality); psychological harm such as
internalizing (e.g., emotional or behavioral problems that are
focused inward such as depression, anxiety, dissociative
disorder, and eating disorder) and externalizing problems
(e.g., behaviors that are directed toward the external environ-
ment including physical aggression, disobeying rules, and anti-
social and offending behaviors); substance use by the child
includes early onset of alcohol and/or drug use, frequent use,
and experience of alcohol and/or drug problems; educational
impact includes school attainment, punctuality, truancy, or sus-
pension; and social impact includes parent­child relationship
quality, family functioning and home environment, parent
supervision, and experience of abuse.
Papers were excluded if 50% of the parent sample were
dependent upon substances other than tobacco (defined as
those with a diagnosis of dependence, in receipt of agonist
prescribing or attendance at treatment services); insufficient
detail is reported for the review team to confidently assess the
criteria for high-risk substance misuse levels; were reporting on
a qualitative study or were not published in English. The meth-
odological quality of each study included was assessed accord-
ing to the criteria presented in the quality assessment tool for
systematic reviews of observational studies (Wong, Cheung, &
Hart, 2008). This scale is based on a cumulative score across
5 items: external validity, reporting (2 items), bias, and con-
founding factors. Studies achieving 67% or more in scoring
were regarded as high quality, 34­66% medium, and less than
34% low quality. We have standardized the language used
within the review when referring to all studies meeting the
criteria for high-risk parental substance misuse. We use the
term parental substance misuse when referring to studies that
report on parents who misuse alcohol and/or drugs. When the
source study examines only alcohol or drug misuse, we use the
term parental alcohol misuse or parental drug misuse, respec-
tively. Within the tables and figures, however, we will include
further clarification relating to the specific levels reported upon
within the source studies.
Results
Description of Studies
We identified 36 papers (reporting on 33 unique studies) that
reported upon adverse outcomes of children of nondependent
parental substance misusers. The majority (N ¼ 17) of the
studies were conducted in the United States, 5 in the United
Kingdom and 12 in other European countries and two other
countries worldwide (Australia and Korea). The sample sizes
of the included studies ranged from 30 to 740,618 (mean
sample 23,896). We assessed 13 studies as being of high
methodological quality, 15 of medium quality, and 8 of low
quality. We have divided the adverse child outcomes into phys-
ical health, psychological well-being, child substance use, edu-
cational, and social. Figure 1 provides further details of the
flow of the studies identified for the review, and the summary
of findings for the included studies is presented in Table 1.
Table 2 highlights the implications for practitioners working
with children at different developmental stages.
Child Health Impact
Six unique studies showed a significant positive association
between parental substance misuse and negative child health
outcomes. Baker et al. (2015) and Tyrrell, Orton, Tata, and
Kendrick (2012) conducted high-quality large UK
population-based matched nested case-control studies investi-
gating the association between maternal alcohol misuse and
other risk factors for accidental child injury aged 0­5 years.
Children whose mother's medical record showed a history of
alcohol misuse were found to have a 2-fold higher odds of long
bone fracture (odds ratio [OR] ¼ 2.33, 95% CI [1.13, 4.82], p <
.05; Baker, Orton, Tata, & Kendrick, 2015) and a 5-fold higher
odds of medicinal poisoning (OR ¼ 5.44, 95% CI [1.99, 14.91],
p < .01; Tyrrell, Orton, Tata, & Kendrick, 2012) compared to
those without a record of maternal alcohol misuse. A large,
high-quality, retrospective population study based on Finnish
health-care registers found that children of substance-misusing
mothers were hospitalized due to injury or illness significantly

more frequently and for longer than children whose mothers
did not misuse substances. Inpatient care episodes per 1,000
children were almost double in the group of children with
substance misusing mothers to that of the comparison group
(2,117 vs. and 1,184) with a mean duration of 3.3 days and
2.4 days, respectively (Raitasalo, Holmila, Autti-Ramo,
Notkola, & Tapanainen, 2015). This association was most pro-
nounced in mothers who misused both alcohol and drugs.
Remaining studies were of low quality; therefore, caution
should be applied when considering results. These studies
reported that poor diet (Jeffreys, Hirte, Rogers, & Wilson,
2009), low weight (below the 10th percentile; Joya et al.,
2009), and increased rates of dental problems (Cornelius
et al., 2004, Jeffreys et al., 2009) in children were associated
with substance misuse by parents, while studies have found no
correlation between parental alcohol misuse and sleep in chil-
dren (Tarokh & Carskadon, 2010; Tarokh et al., 2012).
Psychological Impact
There is strong evidence of significant positive association
between parental alcohol misuse and externalizing problems,
with all seven papers (reporting on six unique studies) of
medium to high quality found a significant and positive rela-
tionship (Kendler et al., 2013; Lee & Cranford, 2008; Malone,

alcohol misuse has been found to be associated with conduct
problems (Kendler et al., 2013; Malone et al., 2002, Malone
et al., 2010), most defiant disorders (Malone et al., 2002;
Malone et al., 2010), delinquency (Kendler et al., 2013), and
violence (Rossow, Pape, & Wichstrom, 1999). There were
mixed findings relating to attention and hyperactivity difficul-
ties in the children of alcohol misusers, with two studies finding
a significant association (Kendler et al., 2013; Torvik et al.,
2011), while two papers from one linked study found no asso-
ciation (Malone et al., 2002; Malone et al., 2010). Only one
study examined the impact of parental misuse of substances
other than alcohol (Torvik et al., 2011), finding an association
of modest effect size upon child attention and conduct prob-
lems. Studies mostly reported association between both moth-
ers' and fathers' substance misuse and child externalizing
difficulties. One paper reported that the relationship was
greater when maternal alcohol misuse was present (Torvik
et al., 2011). A further study found gender-modeling associa-
tions between the parent and child; maternal alcohol misuse
was found to be significantly correlated with rule-breaking and
aggressive behavior in girls but not in boys, while paternal
alcohol misuse was found to be significantly associated with
aggressive behavior in boys but not girls (Finan, Schulz, Gor-
don, & Ohannessian, 2015).
There was limited evidence of a significant association
between maternal or paternal alcohol misuse and internalizing
disorders in children. In a medium quality study using child
report measures of parental drinking, both paternal and mater-
nal alcohol misuse were related to depression and anxiety for
girls but not for boys (Ohannessian, 2012). In a small,
medium-quality cohort study of Korean school children aged
12­16 years, parental alcohol misuse was found to be
Table 2. Evidence of Adversity by Age of Child: Implications for Practitioners Working With Children.
Age of Children Potential Impact Upon Children
Early childhood (0­7 years) Greater likelihood of being involved in an accident, self-poisoning incident, and sustaining an injury (Baker et al,
2015; Tyrrell et al, 2012). Requirement for medical attention and admittance to hospital (Raitasalo et al, 2015) .
More likely to require inpatient care for a longer period (Raitasalo et al, 2015). Inadequate diet and
underweight. Children maybe left in places of unknown safety (Freishleret al, 2014).
Early adolescence (10­13
years)
Poor dental hygiene resulting in higher likelihood dental problems, however may not access dental care
(Corneliuset al, 2004). Low shyness, hyperactivity, attention difficulties, and conduct problems (Kendler et al,
2013). Early onset alcohol use, cigarette use, and illicit drug use (Cranford et al, 2010; Jeffreys et al, 2009;
Kendler et al, 2013; Kerr et al, 2012). Externalizing and internalizing difficulties may begin to emerge (Lee and
Cranford, 2008; Malone et al, 2002; Rossow et al, 1999; Torvik et al, 2011).
Middle adolescence (14­16
years)
Externalising difficulties including conduct problems, delinquent behaviour, rule breaking, aggressive behaviour,
attention difficulties (Finan et al, 2013; Lee and Cranford, 2008; Malone et al, 2002; Rossow et al, 1999; Torvik et
al, 2011). Internalising difficulties including depression and anxiety Lee and Cranford, 2008; Ohannessian, 2012).
Regular substance misuse include frequent intoxication, illicit drug use and the development of substance
misuse problems (Cranford et al, 2010; Delaney-Black, 2011; Finan et al, 2013; Haugland et al, 2013; Hofler et al,
1999; Hopfer et al, 2003; Jeffreys et al, 2009; Jennison et al, 2014; Keeley et al, 2015; Lieb et al, 2002; Malone et
al, 2002; Rossow et al, 1999; Shorey et al, 2013; Swaim et al, 2011; van fer Zwaluw et al, 2008; Vermeulen-Smit
et al, 2012; Yule et al, 2013). Poor school attendance relating to truancy, absenteeism and punctuality (Berg et al,
2016; Jeffreys et al, 2009; Jennison et al, 2014). Poor attachment to parents, relationship and communication
problems within the family (Jennison et al, 2014).
Late adolescence (16­18
years)
Violent behavior, attention difficulties, alcohol and drug problems, and school-based conduct difficulties (Cranford
et al, 2010; Finan et al, 2013; Haugland et al, 2012; Haugland et al, 2013; Haugland et al, 2015; Hofler et al, 1999;
Jennison et al, 2014; Keeley et al, 2015; Lieb et al, 2002; Malone et al, 2010; Ohannessian, 2012; Rossow et al,
1999; Swaim et al, 2011; Torvik et al, 2011; Yule et al, 2013).
McGovern et al. 7
positively and significantly associated with internalizing dis-
orders (Lee & Cranford, 2008). Associations in a high-quality
study however did not reach significance (Malone et al., 2002;
Malone et al., 2010).
Child Substance Use Impact
There is a large volume of evidence that parental substance
misuse influenced their child's own substance use, with all
23 included papers (reporting on 20 unique studies) finding a
significant association. This evidence is mostly of medium to
high quality with only two studies being of low quality (Jef-
freys et al., 2009; Yule, Wilens, Martelon, MSimon, & Bieder-
man, 2013). Parental alcohol and/or drug misuse was
significantly associated with early onset adolescent drinking
(Kerr, Capaldi, Pears, & Owen, 2012; Vermeulen-Smit et al.,
2012), alcohol consumption (Cranford, Zucker, Jester, Puttler,
& Fitzgerald, 2010; Haugland, Holmen, Ravndal, & Bratberg,
2013; Jennison, 2014; Keeley, Mongwa, & Corcoran, 2015;
Shorey et al., 2013; Vermeulen-Smit et al., 2012), alcohol
intoxication (Haugland, Holmen, Krokstad, Sund, & Bratberg,
2015; Haugland et al., 2013; Haugland, Strandheim, & Brat-
berg, 2012; Keeley et al., 2015; Rossow et al., 1999), and the
development of alcohol problems (Kendler et al., 2013; Lieb
et al., 2002) as well as adolescent illicit drug use (Delaney-
Black et al., 2011; Haugland et al., 2012; Hofler et al., 1999;
Hopfer, Stallings, Hewitt, & Crowley, 2003; Jeffreys et al.,
2009; Keeley et al., 2015; Malone et al., 2002; Malone et al.,
2010; Shorey et al., 2013). Having two parents who misuse
substances was highlighted as being particularly predictive of
adolescent substance use (Keeley et al., 2015; Swaim, Beau-
vais, Walker, & Silk-Walker, 2011), with regular alcohol use
being almost 4 times as likely (OR ¼ 3.83, CI [1.65, 8.89], p <
.01) and past year illicit drug use almost 6 times as likely (OR ¼
5.90, CI [2.54, 13.7], p < .001) as adolescents with two non-
substance misusing parents (Keeley et al., 2015).
There were mixed findings as to whether the mothers' or
fathers' substance misuse had the strongest association with
child alcohol and/or drug use. Six studies found that both
maternal and paternal substance misuse correlated with adoles-
cents' alcohol (Finan et al., 2015; Haugland et al., 2013; Keeley
et al., 2015; van der Zwaluw et al., 2008) and drug use (Finan
et al., 2015; Keeley et al., 2015) to a similar size of effect.
Studies found that only fathers' and not mothers' substance
misuse was positively associated with adolescent drinking
(Cranford et al., 2010; Ohannessian, 2012) and the range of
substances used in adolescent children (Shorey et al., 2013).
Further studies, however, reported only maternal alcohol mis-
use (Kerr et al., 2012) and maternal drug misuse (Yule et al.,
2013) to be significantly associated with development of alco-
hol or drug misuse in children. When also considering child
gender, both boys and girls have been found to be significantly
more likely to engage with substance using behaviors if their
parents misused alcohol, with boys in particular being found to
experience a negative effect (Haugland et al., 2012).
Educational and Social Impact
Three papers of mixed quality reported on parental alcohol
misuse and its association with negative child education out-
comes. Using a large cohort of over 740,000 Swedish indi-
viduals, Berg, Back, Vinnerljung, and Hjern (2016) conducted
a high-quality study finding that alcohol-related hospital
admissions in parents were significantly associated with
lower school performance in adolescents aged 15­16 years
(Berg, Back, Vinnerljung, & Hjern, 2016). School behavioral
problems were associated with paternal alcohol misuse in
early childhood, with a 3-fold risk of truancy, absenteeism,
suspensions, and conduct problems in a medium quality study
(Jennison, 2014). Family dysfunction, conflict, and ineffec-
tual parenting were found to be strongly correlated to adverse
school outcomes for children in families with an alcohol mis-
using father. The low levels of attachment and bonding to
biological fathers found to be associated with an increase in
school-related behavioral problems of the children were
notable. A small low-quality study in Australia also found
children of substance misusers were more often absent or late
for school (Jeffreys et al., 2009).
The literature on the social outcomes of children whose
parents misuse substances was mixed. Four studies of medium
quality considered the association between alcohol misusing
parents and the parent­child relationship. While one study
showed no significant impact upon the support provided to the
child from the parent (van der Zwaluw et al., 2008), a further
study reported that children of alcohol misusing parents were
significantly less likely to feel emotionally close to their father,
either due to the impact of alcohol misuse upon the father's
behavior, conflict within the home, abdication of family
responsibilities, or estrangement (Jennison, 2014). Parental
bonding and the parent­child relationship were negatively
related to both mothers' and fathers' alcohol misuse in other
research (Shorey et al., 2013). There is conflicting evidence
that parental monitoring is negatively associated with parental
alcohol misuse. One study reported a significant association
between parental alcohol misuse and lower levels of parental
monitoring (Shorey et al., 2013), while a further study reported
that parental alcohol misuse was unrelated to a number of
measures of neglectful parenting practices (Freisthler,
Johnson-Motoyama, & Kepple, 2014).
A significant association with a particularly large effect was
shown in a high-quality study of the number of children of
substance misusing mothers who were placed in care (Raitasalo
et al., 2015). Children of alcohol misusing mothers were 5
times more likely to be placed in care by their seventh birthday
than those raised by nonalcohol misusing parents. Those born
to drug misusing mothers were over 7 times more likely to be in
care by the age of 7, while children whose mothers misused
both alcohol and drugs faced a 9-fold increased risk. These
relationships persisted after controlling for the child's gender
and mothers' socioeconomic status. Once in care, children of
substance misusing mothers were discharged 183% faster than
those children whose mothers did not misuse substances
8 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE XX(X)
(Hussey & Guo, 2005). This somewhat counterintuitive finding
is most likely to relate to an accelerated decision to place the
children in permanent care however rather than reunification of
the family. Further, the low quality of this study means that
findings should be interpreted with caution. A cohort study of
children taken into care also reported on the range of abuse
children may experience while living within substance misus-
ing homes (Jeffreys et al., 2009). Due to the small sample size
in this study, no statistical testing could be conducted. As such,
the existence of a correlation between parental substance use
and abuse is unknown.
Discussion
It is clear from this evidence that nondependent parental sub-
stance misuse is associated with adversity in children. This evi-
dence is more pronounced when both parents misuse alcohol
and/or drugs or when one or more parents misuse a combination
of alcohol and drugs. In early childhood (0­7 years), the evi-
dence from high-quality studies suggests an increased likelihood
of experiencing an injury or health concern, resulting in the need
for medical care. The methodological quality of studies examin-
ing an association with diet, child weight, and dental health is
however of low quality and should be interpreted with caution.
Maternal alcohol misuse in particular is highlighted as a key
predictor for poorer child health. This may in part relate to the
greater role mothers tend to play in the child's early years.
However, there was a paucity of research considering substances
other than alcohol and relating to fathers' substance misuse that
may result in a misleading focus on mothers.
The literature suggests that parental alcohol misuse
increased the likelihood of externalizing problems in children,
with a significant association being reported in all studies being
of medium or high quality. There was less evidence for an
association between parental substance misuse and internaliz-
ing difficulties such as depression and anxiety. Those showing
an association were of medium quality and involved children
exposed to parental intoxication or where family and/or par-
ental factors are present, while a high-quality study did not find
a significant correlation.
There was a large and methodologically robust evidence
base consisting of 23 papers, all finding a significant and pos-
itive relationship between parental alcohol and/or drug misuse
and the child's own use. The evidence appeared particularly
strong in families where both parents misused substances or
when the child was directly exposed to the substance misuse.
Social learning theory explains that we learn behavior from
observing, imitating, and modeling those around us (Bandura,
1997). It is possible that when children observe their parents
consuming alcohol and/or drugs, it encourages the develop-
ment of normative views about substance use. Further, the
availability of alcohol or other substances within the home may
increase the likelihood of adolescent use (Peeters, Koning,
Monshouwer, Vollebergh, & Wiers, 2016).
There is emerging evidence that parental alcohol misuse is
predictive of educational challenges including truancy, school-
related behavioral problems, and lower educational attainment,
although the methodological quality of these studies varied.
The involvement of child welfare services as well as out-of-
home placements for children was also higher in children
whose parents misuse substances. The evidence for an associ-
ation with other social and relational difficulties is however
mixed. There was some suggestion that parental alcohol use
was associated with lower levels of parent­child bonding, com-
munication, and overall relationship quality. However, evi-
dence of neglectful parenting or inadequate parental
supervision was limited and at times contradictory and as such
caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions regard-
ing an association between parental substance misuse and the
quality of parental supervision. Methodological issues further
limit the evidence.
Social workers often interact with families experiencing a
wide range of difficulties. While social workers within chil-
dren's welfare services consider it legitimate within their role
to ask parents about their drug and alcohol use, they experience
difficulty in identifying parents who are substance misusers
(Galvani, Hutchinson, & Dance, 2013; Loughran, Honhman,
& Finnegan, 2010). Typically, they rely upon observations of
the parent's physical presentation and behavior, which is
unlikely to detect levels of misuse below the diagnostic criteria
for dependence (Galvani et al., 2013). Furthermore, those par-
ents who are identified as being substance misusers often do
not receive an intervention, with parents expressing reluctance
to engage with specialist drug and alcohol treatment providers
as they did not perceive themselves as having a substance
misuse problem (Forrester & Harwin, 2006). This suggests that
early, opportunistic intervention delivered by a nontreatment
specialist may be more appropriate.
There is a large amount of high-quality evidence that has
accumulated to support the effectiveness of alcohol screening
and brief interventions with adults who have an alcohol use
disorder with nondependent populations in primary care setting
(Kaner et al., 2007; O'Donnell et al., 2013). However, there are
no studies examining the effectiveness of screening and brief
interventions with substance misusing parents including those
whose children are involved with child welfare services. This
represents a missed opportunity to intervene with this popula-
tion before a parent has developed substance dependency. Such
intervention has the potential to prevent the development of
more problematic patterns of use and prevent harm to children.
Social workers should engage in conversations with parents,
which promote the parent's ability to link their substance mis-
use with adverse experiences and risk of negative outcomes for
their child. Such an interaction may replicate the "teachable
moment" found to be conducive of behavior change following
the delivery of brief interventions within other settings (Babor
& Grant, 1992) and improving outcomes for children.
Limitations
The evidence examined within this review provides support for
an association between parental substance misuse and a
McGovern et al. 9
number of adverse child outcomes at different stages of devel-
opment. There are however some notable gaps. In early child-
hood (0­7 years), the literature focuses upon the relationship
between mothers' substance misuse and child physical health,
with a paucity of research examining behavioral problems,
parent­child bonding, or preparation for school as well as the
impact of fathers' substance misuse. In early adolescence
(10­13 years), there is a lack of research into child education
outcomes, and in each stage of adolescence (10­18 years),
there is a lack of research into parental substance misuse and
child health. There is limited research that considers parental
illicit drug misuse throughout the child's development, with the
majority of research examining the difficulties in children of
alcohol misusing parents.
Due to the inclusion of cross-sectional studies, causal rela-
tionships cannot be determined. Such naive comparisons of
exposed and unexposed groups cannot adequately account for
the many potential confounders nor precisely account for the
measurement of effect (Fewell, Davey Smith, & Sterne, 2007).
For example, genetic predisposition (Agrawal & Lynskey,
2008) and the interaction between genes and the environment
(Cleveland & Wiebe, 2003) may result in intergeneration trans-
mission of substance misuse. Alcohol permissive parenting
(Ennett et al., 2016; Hung, Chang, Luh, Wu, & Yen, 2015),
adolescent monitoring (Kerr, Stattin, & Burk, 2010), lower
parent­child relationship quality (Donaldson, Handren, &
Crano, 2016; El-Sheikh & Buckhalt, 2003; Shorey et al.,
2013), and greater family conflict (El-Sheikh & Flanagan,
2001; Kelly et al., 2011) have been associated with increased
child substance misuse. Furthermore, the direction of a
reported relationship cannot be determined. For example,
while children's conduct difficulties could be a result of par-
ental alcohol misuse, a parent whose child has conduct diffi-
culties may struggle to cope with their child's behavior and
their alcohol consumption may increase in response. While
longitudinal studies can highlight the temporal associations
between variables and may offer greater insight into causa-
tion, such inferences are reliant upon the timing of the beha-
vior in relation to the outcome. For example, studies
examining the impact of parental substance misuse upon
internalizing difficulties in children may assess children prior
to the emergence of any symptoms or early childhood expo-
sure to parental substance misuse may be undetected due to
behavior change that predates study inclusion (Katikireddi,
Green, Taylor, Smith, & Munafo, 2017).
Further Research
Further research into the impact of parental substance misuse
upon the child is needed to address the gaps in the evidence.
Specifically, research examining the various impacts of both
alcohol and illicit drug misuse throughout the stages of the
child's development. Future research should include both
fathers and mothers and be sufficiently powered to enable
analysis of the impact of mothers' versus fathers' use upon
male and female children and utilize longitudinal design,
with regular follow-up throughout the child's development.
This would offer opportunity for causal inferences and also
enable age-related and temporal associations to emerge.
There is also a need for more high-quality research examin-
ing the health, educational, and social impact of parental
substance misuse. The significant variation in how substance
misuse patterns are described within research has presented a
great challenge to this review and ultimately in the further of
knowledge in this area. There is a need for consistency in the
use of terminology describing levels of parental substance
misuse in future research.
In considering the evidence for the impact of nondependent
parental substance misuse on children, focus invariably is on
risks. There is also a need to consider the protective factors that
may be present, which may enhance child resilience to harm.
This review has highlighted evidence that an association
between parental substance misuse is greater when both parents
are substance misusers. Put another way, the presence of one
nonsubstance misusing parent offers some protection. Using
the language of protection, rather than risk, affords an oppor-
tunity to view such protective factors as a possible intervention
mechanism to enhance resilience. Given the evidence identi-
fied that factors such as maternal closeness, attachment, and
parent­child relationship quality are moderators of adversity
(Shorey et al., 2013), future research should include a range of
mediators and, importantly, moderators of harm, which may
inform intervention development.
Conclusions
The findings of this review suggest that the vulnerability to
adverse outcomes is not restricted to children living with
substance-dependent parents. Rather, children may be affected
by a wider continuum of harmful parental substance misuse;
children who are likely to be less visible to practitioners. While
practitioners may find it challenging to identify parents whose
use is not within the dependent range (Galvani et al., 2013),
intervening early in parental risk factors including alcohol and
drug misuse to safeguard children has been highlighted in gui-
dance for health, social care, and third sector partners (Depart-
ment of Health, 2013; HM Government, 2015; Munro, 2011).
As the number of children living with a nondependent sub-
stance misusing parent is likely to be greater than those living
with a substance-dependent parent, intervening with nondepen-
dent parents is likely to bring about most benefit to children on
a population level. Working to promote resilience and to
enhance the child's protective factors is also important. Parents
who do not misuse substances are a resource to this end. More-
over, intervening before a parent has developed a dependency
has the potential to prevent the development of more proble-
matic patterns of use and prevent harm to children.
