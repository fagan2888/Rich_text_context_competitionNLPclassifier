prostate surgery unrelated to cancer were not
included as cases. Controls were men with no
symptoms or surgery. We adjusted for age and
race in logistic regression models and used
sampling weights to account for selection
probability.
RESULTS
Current cigarette smokers had no higher odds
of LUTS than `never' smokers, but former
heavy smokers ( 50 pack-years) had a higher
odds of LUTS than never smokers (odds ratio
2.01; 95% confidence interval 1.04­3.89).
Men who drank alcohol daily had a lower
chance of LUTS than non-drinkers (0.59;
0.37­0.95; P trend, 0.07). All levels of
moderate and vigorous activity were
statistically significantly inversely associated
with LUTS (P trend, 0.06), whereas men who
reported no leisure-time physical activity had
a greater odds of LUTS (2.06; 1.26­3.39).
CONCLUSIONS
Moderate alcohol consumption and physical
activity may be protective against LUTS.
Current cigarette smoking was not
consistently associated with the condition.
The possible association in former smokers
warrants further investigation.

OBJECTIVES
To examine the association of cigarette
smoking, alcohol consumption and physical
activity with lower urinary tract symptoms
(LUTS) in older men.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The study included 2797 men participating in
the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III), who were
aged 60 years. During an interview, LUTS,
smoking history, alcohol consumption and
physical activity were assessed. Cases
comprised men with at least three of the
symptoms of nocturia, hesitancy, weak stream
and incomplete emptying. Men who had had
INTRODUCTION
LUTS are a common bothersome condition in
older men. Although BPH is thought to be one
cause of these symptoms not all men with
symptoms have an enlarged prostate [1];
changes in the tone of prostate and bladder
smooth muscle may also contribute to these
symptoms. Despite the high prevalence of
LUTS not much is known about their causes.
Age is the only well-established risk factor,
but it has been hypothesized that common
lifestyle factors such as smoking,
consumption of alcohol, or physical inactivity
might contribute to the symptoms.
While physical activity generally has been
found to be inversely associated with the
prevalence of LUTS [2,3] the associations of
cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption
with LUTS are more controversial. Most
studies found either no [3­8] or a positive
[9­11] association between cigarette smoking
and LUTS. Fewer studies have evaluated the
association of alcohol intake with LUTS; two
studies reported an inverse association [4,11]
whereas in others there were positive
associations [3,7,9].
The Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III) is a large
American cross-sectional study conducted
between 1988 and 1994. Using the data
collected in NHANES III, we evaluated the
association of cigarette smoking, alcohol
consumption and physical activity with LUTS
in a multi-ethnic group of older men
representative of the USA.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
NHANES III is a nationally representative
cross-sectional study of the non-
institutionalized civilian USA population
conducted between 1988 and 1994 [12]. A
multistage probability sampling design was
used with oversampling of non-Hispanic
blacks, Mexican-Americans and older
participants. Subjects participated in an
interview conducted at home and had an
extensive physical examination. In the present
analysis we included 3117 men who were
aged 60 years at participation. Of these,
we excluded those men with a mobility
impairment (103) or who were not self-
respondents (133); we further excluded 84
men who reported during the interview of
having had a diagnosis of prostate cancer at

some point before the interview. The
remaining 2797 men were included in the
analysis.
During the interview, all men who were aged
60 years were asked to report the following
symptoms, which are part of the AUA
Symptom Index [13]: (a) How many times per
night do you usually get up to urinate (pass
water)? (`nocturia'); (b) when you urinate
(pass water), do you usually feel like you have
not completely emptied your bladder?
(`incomplete emptying'); (c) do you usually
have trouble starting to urinate (pass water)?
(`hesitancy'); and (d) has the force of your
urinary stream of water decreased over the
years? (`weak stream'). In the present analysis,
men were considered as having LUTS if they
reported at least three of the four symptoms.
Nocturia was included as a symptom when
men had to get up at least twice per night.
Men were also asked if they had ever had
surgery for their prostate not related to
cancer. Those men who reported such surgery
were excluded from the cases because
removing the hyperplastic tissue may have
reduced or eliminated symptoms. The controls
were men who reported none of the four
symptoms and had never had prostate
surgery unrelated to cancer. Men with only
one or two symptoms were excluded from the
analysis to increase the specificity of the LUTS
definition. In a cohort of similarly aged men
unselected for urological problems and in
which the AUA Symptom Index was
administered [11], the Pearson correlation
coefficient between the AUA symptom score
and the index using only the four symptoms
of the abbreviated score was 0.7 (P < 0.001).
The agreement between using as the
threshold a score of 3 or 4 on the abbreviated
index and using a score of 15+ on the full
index as the indicator of high moderate/
severe LUTS was 69%.
Smoking history was assessed during the
interview and men were classified according
to their smoking habit into current (1­34, or
35 cigarettes/day), former, or never smokers.
We also calculated pack-years of smoking
from smoking history, a pack-year being
defined as 20 cigarettes/day for 1 year. The
consumption frequency of alcoholic
beverages (beer, wine, liquor) during the past
month was assessed using a food-frequency
questionnaire during the interview. This
method captures long-term habits of alcohol
consumption. We categorized men into those
who consumed none of these three alcoholic
beverages, those who drank up to once per
week, more than once per week but less than
once per day, and those who drank alcohol
once a day or more. During the physical
examination at the Mobile Examination
Center a 24-h dietary recall was administered,
which assessed the amount of alcohol
consumed during the previous day. From
these data, the daily intake of alcohol (in
grams) was calculated. We grouped men as
having an intake of 0, 1­15, 16­37 or 38 g/
day. Furthermore the type and frequency of
leisure-time physical activity in the past
month were ascertained during the interview.
Physical activities were coded and classified
by rate of energy expenditure (i.e. by intensity)
according to a standardized coding scheme
developed by Ainsworth et al. [14]. Men were
grouped by their weekly frequency of
moderate and vigorous activity, defined as
walking, jogging or running, biking,
swimming, aerobics, dancing, calisthenics,
gardening, lifting weights, and other physical
activities, if the metabolic equivalent of the
activity compared to at rest (METs) was >2.4
for men aged 60­64, >1.9 for men aged
65­79, or >1.25 for men aged > 79 years. We
further evaluated the frequency of vigorous
activity only, which was defined as walking
(for men aged > 79), jogging or running (all
men), biking (for men aged > 64), swimming
(all men), aerobics (all men), dancing (for men
aged > 64), calisthenics (for men aged > 64),
gardening (for men aged > 64), lifting
weights (for men aged > 79), and other
physical activity if METs were >5.9 for men
aged 60­64, >4.7 for men aged 65­79, or
>2.9 for men aged > 79 [15]. The waist
circumference of the participants was
measured during the physical examination.
Men were considered to have a history of
hypertension if they currently used
medication to treat hypertension or if they
were told by their doctor on two occasions
that they had hypertension/high blood
pressure.
The results were analysed statistically using
SAS v8.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and
SUDAAN [16] software. We used sample
weights that took into account several
features of the NHANES III survey, i.e. the
specific probabilities of selection for the
individual domains that were over-sampled as
well as non-response and differences
between the sample and the total USA
population [12]. Logistic regression was used
to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI
of LUTS for cigarette smoking, alcohol
consumption and physical activity. In the
logistic regression models, we adjusted for
age (5-year categories) and race (non-
Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, Mexican-
American, other). We further included in the
models the waist circumference (continuous
variable) as a possible confounder, and
mutually adjusted cigarette smoking, alcohol
consumption and physical activity. Trends for
alcohol consumption and physical activity
were tested by assigning to each man the
median value for the exposure category into
which he fell and modelling this term as a
continuous variable, the coefficient for which
was evaluated by the Wald test.
RESULTS
Of the 2797 men in the analysis, 28.8% had
no LUTS and had never had prostate surgery
(controls), 46.7% reported one or two
symptoms and 10.3% reported three or four
symptoms (cases). Men with LUTS were older
than men in the control group and had fewer
years of education (Table 1). These men also
drank less alcohol, but smoking patterns and
weekly frequency of physical activity did not
differ.
Men who currently smoked up to 35
cigarettes/day had no greater odds of LUTS,
but there was insignificantly greater odds of
LUTS in men who smoked 35 cigarettes/per
day (Table 2). However, this association was
strongly attenuated after adjusting for waist
circumference, the frequency of alcohol
consumption, and the frequency of moderate
and vigorous activity. Of these factors, waist
circumference caused the strongest
attenuation of the OR for heavy smoking.
Former smokers had a slightly but not
statistically significant greater odds of LUTS
than never smokers. Men who had ever
smoked 50 pack-years had a higher odds of
LUTS than never smokers. This association was
limited to former smokers; there was no
association among current smokers who had
smoked 50 pack-years. Further adjustment
for waist circumference, but not for
hypertension, attenuated the association of
pack-years with LUTS in both ever and former
smokers.
There was an inverse association between the
frequency of alcohol consumption and LUTS
in this group of older men (Table 2). Compared
to non-drinkers, men who drank alcohol daily
had a significantly lower odds of LUTS. This
association was not substantially altered after

adjusting for waist circumference, physical
activity and cigarette smoking, or for
hypertension. Using a second approach to
assess alcohol consumption by 24-h dietary
recall, men with an alcohol intake of 38 g/
day had a lower OR of LUTS (OR = 0.41, 95%
CI 0.14­1.2, P trend 0.08) than men with no
alcohol intake.
Men who reported no leisure-time physical
activity had a significantly higher odds of LUTS
(OR = 2.09, 95% CI 0.14­1.2, P trend 0.08)
than men who reported some physical activity,
and adjusting for smoking, alcohol intake and
waist circumference did not change this
association. All levels of moderate or vigorous
physical activity were also associated with a
significantly lower odds of LUTS than men
who reported no moderate or physical activity
(Table 2). These results did not change after
further adjusting for history of hypertension
or for the presence of the metabolic syndrome
(data not shown). However, vigorous physical
activity alone was not consistently inversely
associated with LUTS. The most frequently
reported activity was walking. Fewer men with
LUTS than men without reported walking
(33.2% vs 50.8%, P = 0.003). Men who
reported walking had a lower odds of LUTS
than men who did not, although the OR did
not decrease monotonically (Fig. 1). Adjusting
for total frequency of moderate and
vigorous physical activity as well as waist
circumference, smoking and alcohol drinking
did not change the association for walking.
DISCUSSION
In this group of older men in the USA, alcohol
consumption and physical activity (moderate
and vigorous) were both inversely associated
with LUTS. Men who walked regularly were
less likely to have LUTS than men who did not.
There was no association between current
cigarette smoking and LUTS, but we could not
exclude that former heavy smokers were more
likely to have LUTS.
Several studies have examined the association
between cigarette smoking and LUTS, with
inconsistent results. Most studies found no
statistically significant association between
cigarette smoking and LUTS [3­8], whereas
three studies reported a statistically
significantly positive association [9­11]. In an
analysis of the Health Professionals Follow-up
Study [11], heavy smokers had a significantly
higher risk of LUTS than never smokers,
whereas moderate smokers did not. Similarly,
in NHANES III, there was no association for
current cigarette smoking, but a suggestion of
a higher occurrence of LUTS in heavier
current, lifetime and former smokers.
There may be several explanations for LUTS
possibly being more common in long-term
heavy smokers. Nicotine increases
sympathetic nervous system activity [17] and
might contribute to LUTS via an increase in
the tone of the prostate and bladder smooth
muscle. Furthermore, smoking is thought to
be associated with higher concentrations of
testosterone [18]. A higher testosterone
concentration might be associated with
higher intraprostatic dihydrotestosterone
levels, which is thought to be important in the
development of BPH and LUTS [19].
There was a slightly greater chance of LUTS in
former smokers and these men also had a
higher odds of LUTS when they smoked 50
pack-years over their lifetime. Platz et al. [11]
also reported a higher risk of LUTS in former
smokers. The reasons for a greater risk of LUTS
in former smokers are not clear. The greater
waist circumference in former than in current
smokers in this group of men might
contribute to LUTS via increased insulin
resistance [20]. Also, men who develop

symptoms might be more likely to stop
smoking than men without symptoms. In
addition, we cannot exclude chance as an
explanation for this finding.
Men who frequently consumed alcohol were
less likely to have LUTS than men who did not.
There was also a lower odds of LUTS with
increasing daily alcohol intake when using a
second dietary assessment tool that captured
intake the day before the interview. These
results support the findings of two other
studies reporting negative associations
between alcohol consumption and LUTS
[4,11], whereas the association was positive in
two others [3,7]. Platz et al. [11] reported
lower odds in moderate drinkers, but this
protective effect was attenuated in men who
consumed >50 g alcohol/day (ª 3.5 or more
drinks per day). This pattern was also apparent
in another USA cohort study [9], in which
African-American men with an intake of
>72 g/day (five or more drinks per day) had a
significantly higher odds of LUTS than non-
drinkers, whereas there was no association in
moderate consumers. Light to moderate
alcohol consumption is associated with
improved insulin sensitivity [21] and
decreased testosterone concentration [22]. As
an alternative explanation, we cannot exclude
that the observed inverse association between
the frequency of alcohol consumption and
LUTS is caused by avoidance of fluids,
especially of alcoholic beverages that have a
diuretic effect, by men with LUTS, as there
was an insignificantly lower odds of LUTS in
men who drank caffeinated beverages at least
four times a week (data not shown).
In NHANES III, men who were physically active
in their leisure time were less likely to have
LUTS. All levels of moderate and vigorous
activity were inversely associated with LUTS,
but the association for vigorous activity did
not decrease consistently. Two previous
studies reported inverse associations between
the frequency of physical activity and LUTS
[2,3].
Physical activity is associated with improved
insulin sensitivity [23]. We previously reported
statistically significant positive associations
of glycosylated haemoglobin, a long-term
marker of glucose and insulin metabolism,
and the metabolic syndrome with LUTS in this
group of men [24]. Alternatively, reductions in
the odds of LUTS by physical activity might be
caused by changes of sympathetic nervous
system activity. Aerobic exercise training may
elicit adaptations in the adrenergic system,
because the sympathetic nervous system is
activated through each bout of exercise, and
repeated activation of this system could result
in a reduction of the resting system activity
[25]. In contrast to Platz etal. [2] there was no
consistently inverse association between
vigorous physical activity and LUTS in the

present study. Only men who reported
vigorous activity up to twice a week had a
statistically significantly lower odds of LUTS,
but the association was weaker in men who
were more vigorously active. However, in this
general population, few men reported
participating in vigorous physical activity
more than twice a week.
In addition to an inverse association between
total moderate and vigorous activity, men
who walked, the most often reported physical
activity in this group of older men, were
less likely to have LUTS. This association
was reported previously in the Health
Professionals Follow-up Study [2]. A small
case-control study in Japan [26] reported that
walking 10 000 steps or more per day for
12 weeks was inversely associated with
sympathetic nervous activity and blood
pressure in hypertensive men compared
with sedentary men. Therefore, men who
walk regularly might be less likely to have
LUTS because of the lower tone of the
prostate and bladder smooth muscle, and
lower blood pressure, previously been shown
to be positively associated with LUTS
[9,20,24].
Several aspects of the study design merit
further discussion. First, NHANES III is a cross-
sectional study representative of the USA
population of older men, thus aiding in the
broad general applicability of these results.
Also, the elderly were over-sampled, allowing
for more stable estimates in the analysis of
older men. Second, the questions on LUTS in
NHANES III covered four of the seven
questions of the AUA Symptom Index, which
also includes frequency, intermittency and
urgency, which together discriminated
between men with and with no BPH in a
clinical setting [13]. To increase the specificity
of the present analysis, we included only men
with three or four symptoms in the case
group; we exclude men with only one or two
symptoms in the control or case group
because individually these symptoms are not
specific for LUTS. Third, we cannot completely
exclude that some men in the control group
did not report LUTS because they were taking
medications to treat their symptoms.
However, this is unlikely because NHANES III
was conducted between 1988 and 1994, and
medication for treating BPH symptoms was
not approved until 1992 (finasteride) [27] and
1993 (terazosin) [28]. Finally, smoking, alcohol
consumption and physical activity were
assessed concurrently with LUTS. Therefore,
the results reflect associations and are not
necessarily causal.
In conclusion, physical activity, even moderate
activity like walking, may be beneficial for
LUTS. Additionally, moderate alcohol
consumption might be associated with a
reduction in the occurrence of LUTS, whereas
heavy cigarette smoking in the past may
increase the occurrence of LUTS in older men.
Intervention studies are needed to determine
whether the frequency of LUTS can be
modulated by changes in these lifestyle
factors.
