Abstract
The Surveillance Research Program of the
American Cancer Society's Department of
Epidemiology and Surveillance Research
reports its annual compilation of estimated
cancer incidence, mortality, and survival
data for the United States in the year 2000.
After 70 years of increases, the recorded
number of total cancer deaths among men
in the US declined for the first time from
1996 to 1997. This decrease in overall
male mortality is the result of recent down-
turns in lung and bronchus cancer deaths,
prostate cancer deaths, and colon and rec-
tum cancer deaths.
Despite decreasing numbers of
deaths from female breast cancer and
colon and rectum cancer, mortality asso-
ciated with lung and bronchus cancer
among women continues to increase.
Lung cancer is expected to account for
25% of all female cancer deaths in 2000.
This report also includes a summary
of global cancer mortality rates using data
from the World Health Organization.

Introduction
Cancer is an important public health con-
cern in the United States and around the
world. To provide an up-to-date perspec-
tive on the occurrence of cancer, the
American Cancer Society presents an
overview of cancer frequency, incidence,
mortality, and survival statistics for the
year 2000.
Methods
ESTIMATED NEW CANCER CASES
Because the US does not have a nation-
wide cancer registry, the exact number of
new cases of cancer diagnosed each year
in the US and in individual states is not
known. Consequently, we first estimated
the number of new cancer cases occurring
annually in the US from 1979 through
1996 using population data reported by
the US Bureau of the Census and age-spe-
cific cancer incidence rates collected by
the National Cancer Institute's Surveil-
lance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER) program.1 We fitted these annual
cancer case estimates to an autoregressive
quadratic model to forecast the number of
cancer cases expected to be diagnosed in
the US in the year 2000 (Table 1, Fig. 1).2
Between 1987 and 1992, the inci-
dence rate of prostate cancer increased
85%, followed by a decline of 29% be-
tween 1992 and 1996.3 The sharp in-
crease in incidence followed by the de-
cline in recent years probably reflects
extensive use of prostate-specific anti-
gen (PSA) screening in a previously un-
screened population and the subsequent
increase in diagnoses at an early stage.4
We assumed that the number of
prostate cancer cases would approxi-
mate the rates observed prior to wide-
spread use of PSA screening, and there-

fore, we estimated new cases of prostate
cancer for 2000 using a linear projection
based on data from 1979 to 1989.
Because cancer incidence rates and
case counts for 1979 through 1996 were
not available for many states, we could
not use the methods mentioned above to
estimate new cases for individual states
(Table 3). To derive these estimates, we
assumed that the ratio of cancer deaths to
cancer cases for each state was the same
as the ratio for the US.2
ESTIMATED CANCER DEATHS
We estimated the number of cancer
deaths expected to occur in the US in the
year 2000 using underlying cause-of-death
data from death certificates as reported to
the National Center for Health Statistics
(Table 2, Fig. 2).5 The recorded numbers
of cancer deaths occurring annually from
1979 to 1997 were fitted to an autoregres-
sive quadratic model to forecast the num-
ber of cancer deaths expected to occur in
the US in 2000. The estimated number of
cancer deaths for each state was calculat-
ed with the same modeling procedure
used for the total US (Table 4).2
OTHER STATISTICS
Mortality statistics for the leading causes
of death (Tables 6, 7, and 12), the leading
causes of death from cancer (Tables 8, 9),
and cancer mortality rates from 1930 to
1996 (Figs. 5, 6) were obtained using data
from the National Center for Health Sta-
tistics.5 Incidence rates (Table 10, Figs. 3,
4), the probability of developing cancer
(Table 5), and five-year relative survival
rates (Tables 11, 13; Figs. 7, 8) were ob-
tained from the SEER program.3,6 We
computed global cancer mortality rates
(Table 14) using data compiled by the
World Health Organization.7 We includ-
ed data from countries that have: 1) sub-
mitted data for at least one of the years
between 1994 and 1997 using codes from
the ninth or tenth revision of the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases; 2) popu-
lations of 500,000 or more; 3) death
registration of at least 82%; and 4) a pro-
portion of deaths with medically certified
cause of death of at least 95%.8
Selected Findings
EXPECTED NUMBERS OF NEW CANCER
CASES
In the year 2000, we estimate that about
1,220,100 new cases of invasive cancer
will be diagnosed in the US (Table 1).
This estimate does not include carcinoma
in situ of any site except urinary bladder,
and it does not include basal and squa-
mous cell cancers of the skin. Approxi-
mately 1.3 million cases of basal and
squamous cell skin cancers, 42,600 cases
of breast carcinoma in situ, and 28,600
cases of in situ melanoma are expected to
be newly diagnosed in 2000.
Among men, the most common can-
cers in 2000 are expected to be cancers of
the prostate, lung and bronchus, and colon
and rectum (Fig. 1). The prostate is the
leading site for cancer incidence, account-
ing for 29% of new cancer cases in men.
This year, 180,400 new cases of prostate
cancer are expected to be diagnosed.
Among women, the three most com-
monly diagnosed cancers are expected to
be cancers of the breast, lung and
bronchus, and colon and rectum (Fig. 1).
Cancers occurring at these sites are ex-
pected to account for over 50% of new
cancer cases in women. Breast cancer
alone is expected to account for 182,800
new cancer cases (30%) in 2000.
TRENDS IN CANCER INCIDENCE
For all sites combined, SEER cancer inci-
dence rates appeared to peak in 1992 and
decreased an average of -2.2% per year
from 1992 to 1996.9 Similar declines have
been seen recently for specific leading
cancer sites (Figs. 3 and 4).
Breast cancer incidence rates have
remained approximately level during the
1990s; however, they appear to be de-
creasing in younger women. Decreases in
colon and rectum cancer incidence rates

began in the mid-1980s, and have been
observed among both males and females
in all racial/ethnic groups (with the excep-
tion of American Indian women in whom
data were not sufficient to make a deter-
mination as to the direction of this trend).3
Incidence rates of colon and rectum can-
cer declined significantly between 1990
and 1996, on average -2.1% per year.9
A downturn in the incidence of lung
and bronchus cancer in males began in
the late 1980s, and between 1990 and
1996, incidence rates decreased signifi-
cantly, -2.6% per year. Incidence rates of
lung and bronchus cancer among females
are stabilizing, and have begun to decline
among women aged 40 to 59.9 Prostate
cancer incidence rates also declined sig-
nificantly between 1990 and 1996, on
average -2.0% per year.
EXPECTED NUMBERS OF CANCER DEATHS
In 2000, an estimated 552,200 Americans
are expected to die of cancer--more than
1,500 people a day (Table 2). Most can-
cer deaths in men (52%) in the year 2000
are expected to be from cancers of the
lung and bronchus, prostate, and colon
and rectum (Fig. 2).
Among women, cancers of the lung
and bronchus, breast, and colon and rec-
tum are expected to account for more than
half of all cancer deaths in 2000 (Fig. 2). In
1987, lung cancer surpassed breast cancer
as the leading cause of cancer death in
women and is expected to account for
25% of all female cancer deaths in 2000.
TRENDS IN THE RECORDED NUMBER OF
CANCER DEATHS
Following more than 70 years of increas-
es, the recorded number of total cancer
deaths among men in the US has declined
for the first time, from a peak of 281,898
in 1996 to 281,110 in 1997. This promis-
ing change results from recent downturns
in each of the top three causes of cancer
death among men. Lung and bronchus
cancer deaths among men declined from
a peak of 92,493 in 1993 to 91,278 in 1997.
Prostate cancer deaths declined from a
peak of 34,902 in 1994 to 32,891 in 1997.
Colon and rectum cancer deaths among
men were highest in 1990 at 28,635 and
have declined to 28,075 in 1997.
Among women, the recorded num-
ber of total cancer deaths continues to in-
crease, although the rate of increase has
diminished in recent years. The upward
trend among females is primarily due to
sustained increases in the number of
deaths from lung and bronchus cancer.
The numbers of deaths from breast and
colorectal cancers among females, how-
ever, have begun to decline. Breast can-
cer deaths were highest in 1995 at 43,844
and have declined to 41,943 in 1997. Col-
orectal cancer deaths among women
have declined from a recent peak of
29,237 in 1995 to 28,621 in 1997, although
these deaths reached their all-time high in
1984 at 29,522.
TRENDS IN CANCER DEATH RATES
Death rates for all cancers combined
peaked in 1991 and decreased an average
-0.7% per year from 1991 to 1996 (Figs. 5
and 6).9 Significant decreases have been
seen among both males and females, per-
sons younger than 65 years of age, and
among whites, blacks, and Hispanics.
Breast cancer death rates in females
decreased an average of -1.8% per year
between 1990 and 1996; decreases were
more pronounced among white women
and among younger women. During the
period from 1990 to 1996, colon and rec-
tum cancer death rates decreased signifi-
cantly, on average -1.7% per year.
Similar to trends in incidence, signifi-
cant decreases in death rates for lung and
bronchus cancer have occurred only
among males (on average -1.6% per year
between 1990 and 1996); rates among fe-
males recently have begun to slow and
appear to be stabilizing. Prostate cancer
death rates decreased on average -1.6%
per year during the period between 1990
and 1996.

TRENDS IN CANCER BY
RACE/ETHNICITY
Overall rates of cancer incidence vary
considerably among racial and ethnic
groups (Table 10). Blacks have the high-
est cancer incidence rates: They are about
60% more likely to develop cancer than
are Hispanics and Asian/Pacific Islanders
and more than twice as likely to develop
cancer as American Indians. Between
1990 and 1996, incidence rates decreased
among whites (-1.2% per year), Hispan-
ics (-1.7% per year), and American Indi-
ans (-0.7% per year), and remained rela-
tively stable among blacks and Asian/
Pacific Islanders.3
White women are more likely to de-
velop breast cancer than are women of
other racial and ethnic groups, and black
women are more likely to develop can-
cers of the colon and rectum.3 Black men
have the highest incidence rates for can-
cers of the colon and rectum, lung and
bronchus, and prostate. They are also at
least 50% more likely to develop prostate
cancer than men of other racial and eth-
nic groups.
Blacks are about 33% more likely
to die of cancer than are whites, and
more than twice as likely to die of cancer
as are Asian/Pacific Islanders, American
Indians, and Hispanics. Between 1990
and 1996, mortality rates decreased sig-
nificantly among whites (-0.5% per
year), blacks (-0.9% per year), and His-
panics (-0.6% per year); remained rela-
tively stable among Asian/Pacific Is-
landers; and may be increasing among
American Indians.3
Black women are more likely to die
of breast (see article by Dignam in this is-
sue of CA, page 50) and colon and rectum
cancers than are women of any other
racial or ethnic group, and they have ap-
proximately the same lung and bronchus
cancer death rate as white women. As
was seen with incidence rates, black men
have the highest mortality rates of colon
and rectum, lung and bronchus, and
prostate cancers.3
CANCER IN CHILDREN
Cancer is the second leading cause of
death among children between one and 14
years of age in the US; accidents are the
most frequent cause of death in this age
group (Table 12). The most commonly
occurring cancers in children are leu-
kemias (in particular, acute lymphocytic
leukemia), tumors of the central and sym-
pathetic nervous systems, lymphomas,
soft-tissue sarcomas, and renal tumors.3
Over the past 20 years, there have been
significant improvements in the five-year
relative survival rate for many childhood
cancers, especially acute lymphocytic and
acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, and Wilms' Tumor (Table 13).
Between 1974/1976 and 1989/1995, five-
year relative survival rates for childhood
cancers at all sites combined improved
from 56% to 75%.
Limitations and Future Challenges
Our estimates of the expected numbers of
new cancer cases and cancer deaths
should be interpreted with caution when
tracking trends over time. These estimates
may vary considerably from year to year,
particularly for rare cancers and for states
with smaller populations. We therefore
discourage the use of these estimates to
track year-to-year changes in cancer oc-
currence and death. The recorded num-
ber of cancer deaths and cancer death
rates from the National Center for Health
Statistics, and SEER cancer incidence
rates are generally more informative sta-
tistics for the purpose of tracking cancer
trends. For example, breast cancer inci-
dence rates increased about 1% per year
between 1979 and 1982, increased 4% per
year between 1982 and 1987, and were ap-
proximately constant between 1987 and
1996. Despite the stabilization of inci-
dence rates during the latter time period,
the estimates of new breast cancer cases
increased between 1988 and 1996.
Our estimates are based on the most
currently available cancer mortality and
C A C a n c e r J C l i n 2 0 0 0 ; 5 0 : 7 - 3 3
Vol. 50 No. 1 January/February 2000 11
incidence data; however, these data are
three and four years old, respectively, at
the time that the estimates are calculated.
As such, the effects of large changes oc-
curring in the three- or four-year interval
between 1996 or 1997 and 2000 cannot be
captured by our modeling efforts. Finally,
our estimates of new cancer cases are
based on incidence rates for the geo-
graphic locations that participate in the
SEER program and, therefore, may not
be representative of the total US.
Despite these limitations, our esti-
mates do describe current patterns of
cancer incidence and mortality in the
US. Such estimates will assist our con-
tinuing efforts to reduce the public
health burden of cancer as we enter the
21st century.
