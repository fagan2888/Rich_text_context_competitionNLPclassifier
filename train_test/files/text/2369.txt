SELF-REPORTED health (SRH) has often been used as an
indicator of underlying health status in population health
research. Studies have shown that SRH is associated with
mortality (1­3) and can sometimes be a better predictor of
diverse aspects of well-being than clinical factors among
older people (4). SRH itself is predicted by several dimen-
sions of healthy aging--independent living, vision, hearing,
activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily liv-
ing, absence of physical illness, cognition, healthy mood,
social support and participation, and religious participation
and spirituality (5). These relationships imply that SRH is a
good indicator of health among older adults. Therefore,
examination of other dimensions that influence SRH should
help improve our understanding of healthy aging in human
populations.
A number of social and behavioral factors are associated
with SRH. Advanced age, female gender, and low socioeco-
nomic status are important risk factors for poor SRH (6­8).
Socioeconomic status at the community level may be im-
portant too as it has been reported that individuals living in
poor neighborhoods in seven Dutch cities tend to have poor
SRH (9). Health behaviors such as active physical exercise
may reduce the likelihood of poor SRH (10). Social vari-
ables such as social network participation and support are
associated with better SRH (11). A recent study demon-
strated that both chronic life stress and stress from a trau-
matic shock are strongly associated with poor SRH, and the
effects seem to be stronger in women (12). Life stress may
affect health outcomes in several ways, including via acti-
vating the hypothalamic­pituitary­adrenal axis and sym-
pathetic nervous system, which has been associated with
elevated risk of poor health outcomes, such as hypertension
and heart disease, if activation is excessive or prolonged
(13). Stress also may affect health through changes in immune
function (14).
Apolipoprotein E (APOE), one of the most studied genes
in the human population, is associated with a number of
chronic diseases. Studies have shown that carriers of the
APOE4 allele have an increased risk for cardiovascular dis-
ease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease (15­18).

Based on the multiple logistic regression analysis of data from a random sample of 1,023 old adults collected in Taiwan
in 2000, we found that interactions between carrying the APOE4 allele and one of four life stress factors (relocated main-
lander, living in a crowded household with six or more persons, living in an earthquake-damaged house, and monthly
financial difficulty) significantly increased the odds ratio of poor self-reported health. Correlations between carrying the
APOE4 allele and the life stress factors were ruled out by statistical tests. These life stress factors had a substantially
larger adverse impact on self-reported health in APOE4 allele carriers than in noncarriers. This study provides evidence
that interaction between carrying APOE4 allele and chronic life stressors has significant impacts on self-reported health
while controlling for various sociodemographic and health behavior factors. Further studies with richer biomarkers are
warranted for deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms.

INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LIFE STRESS AND APOE4 1055
The APOE4 allele is associated with a number of major
health outcomes, including mortality, decline of cognitive
function, decreased functional status among elderly partici-
pants without dementia (19,20), and an earlier age of onset
of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (21,22). A
twin-based study suggested that one third of the variability
in SRH can be attributed to genetic factors (23). Recently,
the APOE4 allele was found to be associated with poor
SRH; the association was stronger in women than in men,
after controlling for demographic factors, socioeconomic
status, and health behaviors (12). These findings suggest
that the APOE4 allele may play a multifaceted role in exac-
erbating a number of disease conditions associated with
human aging.
Research has shown that, in addition to direct genetic
transmission, the interactions between genetic and environ-
mental factors also play a crucial role in health and aging
(24); environmental factors may regulate gene expression
via DNA methylation and histone modification, which then
influence health and longevity of the elderly participants
(25,26). Thus, gene expressions depend on the environment
surrounding the organism and gene­environment interac-
tions. Based on intensive literature reviews and investiga-
tions/discussions, including several workshops, the Institute
of Medicine Committee concluded in their widely cited
report: "Few diseases or conditions are caused purely by
genetic factors; most are the result of interactions between
genetic and environmental factors. Therefore, to expand our
knowledge of how to improve the health of individuals and
populations, it becomes imperative to conduct research that
explores the effects of interactions among social, behav-
ioral, and genetic factors on health" (25).
Given the growing consensus concerning the importance
of interactions between genotypes and environmental risk
factors (abbreviated as "G × E" hereafter), several studies
have indicated sizable impacts of interactions between the
APOE4 genotype and environmental exposures. For example,
the impact of a number of environmental factors on the risk
of cardiovascular disorders and neurological disorders such
as Parkinson's disease appears to be exacerbated in carriers
of the APOE4 allele (27). Similarly, a study on the expected
benefit of physical activity in reducing risk of dementia did
not observe this beneficial effect in APOE4 carriers, further
demonstrating the potential adverse effect of the APOE4
allele (28).
A number of animal studies have focused on examining
how stress level and APOE status interact to affect gluco-
corticoid levels and cognitive performance; however, only
a limited number of studies in this field have been con-
ducted in humans (29). In human studies, both stress and
the APOE4 allele have been associated with chronic eleva-
tion in cortisol, which may lead to memory loss (29,30). One
study found that increased life stress levels were associated
with more depressive symptoms in nondemented female care-
givers who are carriers of APOE4 allele, but this relationship
was not significant in noncarriers of APOE4 (31). This sug-
gests that carriers of the APOE4 allele may respond differ-
ently to psychological stress than do noncarriers of the
APOE4 allele. Although suggesting that there might be a
theoretical basis for important interactions between life
stress factors and APOE4 status, these studies were based
on small sample sizes of less than 100 participants, and poten-
tial confounders such as sociodemographic and behavioral
factors were not controlled for (29­31).
Our careful literature review has indicated that, although
much prior research have discovered the association be-
tweenAPOE4 and health outcome including SRH as well as
the association between environmental factors and SRH,
few studies have investigated the effects of the interactions
between carrying the APOE4 allele and the environmental
risk factors on SRH in general; more specifically, in our lit-
erature search, we could locate no population-based studies
with large sample sizes adequate for genetic analysis that
have been conducted to examine the interaction between
APOE4 status and life stress on SRH or other health condi-
tions in older adults. Our present study fills this research
gap. Because SRH is believed to be a summary indicator of
different dimensions of healthy aging and based on the the-
oretical foundation that both APOE4 and prolonged stress
are associated with poor health outcomes, we hypothesize
that interactions between APOE4 status and life stress
factors may significantly increase the odds of self-reported
poor heath; namely, the negative effects of life stress on
SRH may be substantially more serious in APOE4 carriers
than in noncarriers.We have tested this hypothesis via multiple
random-effect logistic regression analysis of data collected
from a population-based study of older adults in Taiwan
while controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and
health behavior factors.
Data Source, Measurements, and Methods
Data Source and Study Participants
The study participants were adults 55 years of age or
older from the Social Environment and Biomarkers of
Aging Study conducted in 2000, which was based on a ran-
dom subsample of respondents to the longitudinal Survey of
Health and Living Status in Taiwan. Social Environment
and Biomarkers of Aging Study randomly selected a total
of 1,713 respondents from the 1999 wave of the Survey of
Health and Living Status (4). Of the 1,713 selected Survey
of Health and Living Status respondents, 1,497 (87.4%)
participated in the Social Environment and Biomarkers of
Aging Study interviews. Of the respondents who were inter-
viewed, 1,023--590 men (58%) and 433 women (42%)--
participated in the physical examination and biospecimen
collection (32).
Each face-to-face in-home interview was conducted by a
local public health nurse. On a scheduled day several weeks
ZENG ET AL.
1056
after the interview, participants collected a urine sample
after fasting 12 hours overnight and had a medical exam the
next morning at a nearby hospital, where medical personnel
drew a blood specimen and anthropometric measurements
from the participants (32).
Measurements
The health outcome measure was SRH, which was origi-
nally measured on a 5-point scale: excellent, good, average,
not so good, and poor (12.0, 13.0, 47.8, 23.58, and 3.5%,
respectively, in this study sample). For multiple regression
analysis, a binary SRH score was recoded as 1 if an individual
rated his or her health as not so good or poor and 0 if excellent,
good, or average. Because we mainly focused on examining
the interaction of APOE4 and life stress factors, we classi-
fied APOE4 genotype into a binary variable (APOE4 carrier
status) following the dominant model. Individuals who
carry one or two copies of the minor allele of APOE4 are
coded as "1" (carrier), and the individuals who do not carry
the minor allele are coded as "0" (noncarrier).
As discussed in the literature, life stress can be measured
by perceived stress, economic difficulties, security, and
safety, and it has been associated with physiological dys-
regulation in older adults (33,34). In this study, we use the
variable of six or more persons living in the household and
difficulty meeting monthly living expenses to indicated
chronic living environment and financial stress. Experienc-
ing housing damage during the 1999 earthquake is used to
measure life stress due to a traumatic event. We also used
another variable as an indicator of life stress: mainlander
people who were forced to leave the Mainland of China for
Taiwan in 1948­1949 at the end of the Chinese Civil War.
Almost all of them have been isolated from the rest of their
family of origin and hometowns throughout their life up to
2000 when the survey was conducted. (The forced reloca-
tion of about one million military force and governmental
officers of the Kuomingtang party from the Mainland to
Taiwan occurred in 1948­1949. Consequently, almost all
the mainlander participants aged 55 years and older were
forced to come to Taiwan either as an adult or as a child
with parents and totally isolated from the rest of their family
members and hometowns throughout their life up to 2000.
The exchanges and communications between Taiwan and
the Mainland only became increasingly available after 2000
[and accelerated in most recent years].) As a result, they
and their family members may have suffered from chronic
life stress.
Control variables included in the analyses were health
behaviors and sociodemographic factors. Health behaviors
included diet, alcohol use, smoking, and exercise. Socio
demographic factors included age, gender, marital status,
urban or rural residence, education, and occupation. Obesity,
defined as body mass index greater than 30 weight/height
(kg/m2), was included to measure physical condition. Table 1

There were remarkable differences in age, ethnicity, educa-
tion, and occupation between men and women. The non-
mainlander Fujianese and Hakka people (Both Fujianese
and Hakka people are the native Taiwanese.) account for
71% and 12% of the total sample, respectively, whereas
mainland people account for 17%.
APOE was genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction
amplification refractory mutation system (PCR_ARMS) and
polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length poly-
morphism (PCR_RFLP) analysis. The chi-square test was
performed to test Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium in the APOE
gene so that one could assess potential genotyping error and
the appropriateness of sample selection (32).
Statistical Analysis
Because the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging
Study survey design involved multistage cluster sampling,
individuals within the same cluster may be correlated statis-
tically because they share some unobserved heterogeneity.
Statistically, ignoring this type of correlation may lead
to overestimates of standard errors of the parameters.
Therefore, multiple random-effect logistic regression was
performed to correct for the intra-cluster correlation by
including random effects into the model.
Note that statistically significant estimates of interaction
terms derived from the multiple random-effect logistic
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LIFE STRESS AND APOE4 1057
regression analysis represent significant synergistic effects
of the genetic­environment interactions. The synergistic
effects may not exactly reflect the interaction effects of G × E
as the estimates may or may not be confounded by gene­
environment correlations (abbreviated as "rGE" hereafter).
The rGE refers to the idea that certain genotypes have causal
effects on environmental risk factors and influence health
outcomes indirectly through these pathways; in other words,
genes influence people's tendencies to create their own en-
vironments (35,36). Thus, we need to do additional analysis
to detect whether rGE exists. For all significant estimates of
G × E interaction terms with a continuous environmental
variable, we use the analysis of variance model and the
multiple regression model (adjusting for the confounders)
to test whether there are significant differences in the con-
tinuous environmental factors between the carriers and non-
carriers of theAPOE4 genotype. For all significant estimates
of G × E interaction terms with a discrete environmental
variable, we use the chi-squared test and the multiple re-
gression model (adjusting for the confounders) to assess
whether there are significant differences in the environmental
categories between the carriers and noncarriers of the APOE4
genotype. For all significant rGE detected by analysis of
variance or chi-square test and the multiple regression anal-
ysis (Note that if the chi-squared test or the analysis of var-
iance F test [both are not adjusted for any covariates] shows
a significant difference in the frequency or the mean of the
environmental factor, we need to further perform the multi-
ple regression analysis because the difference may be due to

to conduct path analysis employing advanced structural
equation modeling or other kinds of multivariate statistical
analysis, adjusted for the potentially confounding factors, to
further explore the interplay among genetic variant, envi-
ronment, and health outcome. Based on the path analysis,
we may estimate the direct genetic effect (pGH in Figure 1)
and the genetic­environment interaction effects (G × E in
Figure 1) on the health outcome; we may also decompose
the total effects of the environmental exposure on the health
outcome (pEH in Figure 1) into two components: (a) the
genetic factor's indirect effects that work through its
impacts on environmental exposure and (b) the effects
solely caused by the environmental exposure (37­39)--see
Figure 1 for the theoretical framework of analysis to explore
the gene­environmental interactions (G × E) and correla-
tions (rGE).
All analyses were performed using STATA statistical
software Release 9 (40).
Results
Table 2 provides the distribution of prevalence of poor
SRH by a number of life stress factors. Overall, there was
little difference in prevalence of poor SRH by ethnicity.
Among APOE4 carriers, mainlander people reported poor
SRH more often (50%) compared with the Fujian (30.69%)
and Hakka (18.75%). However, this ethnic pattern was
not observed in APOE4 noncarriers. Individuals who lived
in a crowded household with six or more persons, had
monthly financial difficulties, or whose house was dam-
aged during the 1999 earthquake (which occurred 1 year
before the interview) were more likely to have poor SRH.
This was consistent among APOE4 carrier and noncarrier
groups. APOE4 allele carriers tended to have higher prev-
alence of poor SRH (32.87%) than APOE4 noncarriers
(25.99%).

household with six or more persons had significantly higher
risk of reporting poor SRH (OR = 2.05, p = .04, 95% CI:
1.03­4.05) compared with those living alone. Individuals
who experienced housing damage in the 1999 earthquake
were significantly more likely to have poor SRH (OR =
1.69, p = .017, 95% CI: 1.10­2.60). Monthly financial dif-
ficulty significantly increased risk of poor SRH (OR = 1.74,
p = .002, 95% CI: 1.23­2.47).
Panel B of Table 4 presents the ORs for the interaction
terms (the relative excess risk due to the G × E interaction
[RERI]) between carrying APOE4 allele and the life stress
factors, adjusted for potential confounding factors. ORs for
the interaction between APOE4 and relocated mainlander
(OR = 3.73; p = .014), betweenAPOE4 and living with six or
more persons (OR = 3.08; p = .009), between APOE4 and liv-
ing in an earthquake-damaged house (OR = 3.45; p = .018),
and between APOE4 and monthly financial difficulty (OR =
2.57; p = .011) are statistically significant; estimates of the
other interaction terms are not statistically significant.
Table 5 presents the estimates of the chi-squared test
to assess the genotype frequency difference across the cate-
gories of the life stress factors of which presented statisti-
cally significant interactions with APOE4 carrier status in
Table 4 (relocated mainlander, living in a household of six
or more persons, living in earthquake-damaged house, and
monthly financial difficulty). Clearly, the possibility of rGE
correlation confounding G × E interaction effects is ruled
out based on the nonsignificant estimates of chi-square tests
(see Table 5). Thus, there is no need to do any further path
analysis to separate the confounding rGE correlation from
the G × E interaction. The estimates presented in Tables 4
and 5 suggest that the interactions between APOE4 carrier
status and one of these four life stress factors (being a relo-
cated mainlander, living with six or more persons, living
in earthquake-damaged house, and monthly financial diffi-
culty) significantly increase the likelihood of self-reporting
poor health.

defined as ``a different effect of an environmental exposure
Table 3 presents APOE carrier status frequency by age
group and gender. The proportion carrying at least one copy
of the APOE4 allele was slightly different between women
(16.2%) and men (13.1%). It appeared that the frequency of
at least one copy of the APOE4 allele was higher in both
younger (age <70 years) and older (age >80 years) women
than in men. The overall APOE4 allele frequency distribu-
tions in this sample from Taiwan were similar to those
reported in other populations of Asian origin (41).

INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LIFE STRESS AND APOE4 1059
on disease and health risk in persons with different geno-
types (25)." Such a standard definition of the G × E interac-
tion leads to an intuitive way to explore the G × E interaction
effects by comparing the relative risks of health outcomes
between those who are exposed or not exposed to the envi-
ronmental factor within the group of carriers of the geno-
type and within the group of noncarriers. As shown in Table 6,
among the noncarriers of APOE4 minor allele, being a relo-
cated mainlander, living in a crowded household with six or
more persons, living in an earthquake-damaged house, and
having monthly financial difficulty increased the risk of
poor SRH by 55%, 105%, 69%, and 74%, respectively.
However, these four life stress factors dramatically increased
the risk of poor SRH by 478%, 531%, 483%, and 347%,
respectively, among carriers of the APOE4 minor allele.
Clearly, the negative impacts of the life stress factors are
much stronger among the APOE4 allele carriers than that
among the noncarriers.
Discussion
Although previous studies have indicated that both the
APOE4 allele and the life stress may negatively affect
health outcomes (42), there has been little research examin-
ing the effects of interactions between APOE4 and life
stress factors on SRH. Remarkably, our study shows that
the interactions between carrying the APOE4 allele and a
number of life stress factors (being a relocated mainlander,
living with six or more persons in the household, incurring
1999 earthquake damage to one's home, and suffering
monthly financial difficulty) have significant effects on self-
reported poor health. We also provide important evidence
that these life stress factors have substantially more serious
adverse impacts on SRH in carriers of the APOE4 allele
than in noncarriers.
Life stress can affect health outcomes in several ways;
one pathway is through the hypothalamic­pituitary­adrenal
axis and sympathetic nervous system activity. Chronic
stress can cause activation of the hypothalamic­pituitary­
adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system, which has
been associated with elevated risk of poor health outcomes
such as hypertension and heart disease if activation is exces-
sive or prolonged (43). Stress also may affect cognitive
function through changes in immune function (44).
A recent study (with less than 100 participants) found a
significant interaction between carrying the APOE4 allele
and life stress on an elevated level of cortisol, which may
lead to memory loss, cognitive decline, and possibly other
poor health outcomes in humans (27). Although the mecha-
nisms indicating the pathways through which APOE4 and
life stress interact to affect health outcomes in humans are
not yet clear, animal model studies have shown that APOE
in mice may cause an age-dependent increase in adrenal
corticosterone content at baseline and abnormally increased
plasma corticosterone levels after restraint stress. This may
suggest a key role for APOE in the tonic inhibition of
steroidogenesis and adrenal cortical activity (45). Research
also shows that exposure to life stress factors may be in-
volved in early development of neurodegeneration in mice
with APOE4 (46). These previous studies may provide pos-
sible elicitation on biological explanations for the findings
reported in this article--the interaction between life stress
factors and the APOE4 allele may elevate level of cortisol
and cause memory loss, which adversely affect SRH in old
adults. Our findings may have important implications for
public health. By reducing stressful life events or teaching
coping skills to APOE4 carriers, we may be able to reduce
the risk of poor SRH. Completion of the Human Genome
Project and HapMap Project have provided important tools

for the genetic study of complex human disorders (45).
Meanwhile, advances in molecular technology over the past
decade have led to more genetic research on risk factors
associated with health conditions or diseases related to
human aging. Therefore, studying gene­environment inter-
actions may allow us to take an active role in lowering the
risk of disease and poor health by targeting interventions
based on genetic characteristics and environmental factors.
We are also aware of the important limitations in present
study, such as the not-large-enough total sample size (N =
1,023, with 209 persons aged 55­59, 722 persons aged 60­79,
and only 52 and 40 oldest old male and female participants
aged 80+ years). The very small subsample size of the old-
est old has resulted in that the proportion of APOE4 carriers
abnormally fluctuated from 12.7% at ages 70­79 to 20% at
ages 80+ years for women. Concentration of the limited
sample on young­old aged 55­79 years also prevented us
from employing cortisol or cognitive function as a health
indicator. Clearly, more in-depth research, with larger sam-
ples including more oldest old, more expansive biomarker
collection, and more detailed analyses, is warranted to re-
confirm these findings and to provide deeper understanding
of the underlying biological mechanisms.
