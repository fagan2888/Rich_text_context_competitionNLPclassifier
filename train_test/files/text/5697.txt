Purpose and Rationale
To prepare urban planning students to effectively address
equity and social justice considerations in their professional
practice, there must be an understanding of their fundamen-
tal opinions, beliefs, and values with respect to equity and
social justice. If urban planning instructors can gain more
insight into student disposition related to themes of social
justice and equity, they can then contour and adjust their
pedagogical approaches and strategies in ways to more effec-
tively engage students around those issues, as well as better
support students in their efforts to integrate social justice and
equity principles into their future professional practice.
Overview
The Ideology of Social Justice and Equity in
Planning
Notwithstanding the complexities of developing a social-
justice-oriented curriculum as well as the inherent pedagogical
challenges related to its delivery, there has been a growing
interest in advancing social justice and equity as an important
ethic for promoting human rights (Johnston, 2009). Within
the discipline of urban planning, a practice tradition of advo-
cacy planning emerged in the 1960s, which focused on
promoting equitable and socially just communities (Davidoff,
1965; Krumholz & Clavel, 1994; Krumholz & Forester,
1990; Bingham & Mier, 1993; Thomas, 2006). More recent
concerns about planning education and its need to address
issues related to diverse communities has taken the form of
discussions about culturally competent planning education
(Agyeman & Erickson, 2012).
Professional planners commit to embracing notions of
social and racial justice as an aspiration in their code of eth-
ics and professional conduct (American PlanningAssociation
[APA]; 2009). Within the advocacy planning approach, now
often referred to as the "progressive planning" approach
(Clavel, 1986), there exists a fundamental set of beliefs that
value democratic principles of inclusion and participation
and encourage planners to play an active role in creating
socially and economically just and sustainable communities.
That said, there is evidence that the progressive values of
planning are having difficulty finding resonance and oppor-
tunity to flourish in planning practice in such a way that they
can advance a vision and possibility that embraces equity
outcomes (Thomas, 2008, p. 227).

Understanding the Disposition of Urban
Planning Students Toward Social Justice
and Equity Themes
Kirk E. Harris1
Abstract
This research surveys how graduate level urban planning students think about social justice and equity issues and how
academic instruction in urban planning affects the disposition of students toward these issues and themes in the context of
their development as urban planning professionals. Although the quantitative findings did not demonstrate that the graduate
curriculum and instruction had any appreciable impact on student understanding and navigation of equity and social justice
themes, qualitative evidence did suggest that students are understanding and care about issues related to social justice and
equity and were interested in incorporating those issues into their professional practice. This research also suggests that
graduate academic instruction may fall short in supporting students with the useful integration of social justice and equity
issues into their professional practice.

In 1965, a period of moral and social reckoning in
America, Paul Davidoff posited this thought about the role of
planners in promoting democratic and participatory princi-
ples in planning:
The recommendation that city planners represent and plead the
plans of many interest groups is founded upon the need to
establish an effective urban democracy, one in which citizens
may be able to play an active role in the process of deciding
public policy. Appropriate policy in a democracy is determined
through a process of political debate. The right course of action
is always a matter of choice, never of fact. In a bureaucratic age
great care must be taken that choices remain in the area of public
view and participation. The ideals of inclusiveness, democracy
and public participation remain fundamental to community-
based planning. (p. 332)
Davidoff challenged planning educators to train planners
in ways that required them to invoke their skills to serve
underrepresented low-income communities, as well as
advance social objectives and transformative social policy
such that racial inequality, economic disenfranchisement,
social exclusion, and gender and class bias can be contem-
plated and grappled with by students in the context of their
future planning practice (Checkoway, 1994). In fact, the pro-
motion of these ideals and values associated with planning
practice have been argued to be the most persuasive
approach--if not the only compelling one--for planners to
assume as they seek to reconcile their professionalism with
their political engagement (Marris, 1994; Krumholz &
Forester, 1990). Yet, the social justice and equity concerns of
planning must be understood in the context of the political
history and the political economy of the United States.
Fainstein and Fainstein (1971) posit that
The United States for a variety of historical and cultural reasons
has been dominated by the liberal tradition. This tradition values
individualism, accepts the primacy of private interests, and
prefers minimal government. Thus, the very notion of planning,
which assumes an overriding and ascertainable public interest
that can be maximized through the positive actions of
government is antithetical to general American political values.
(p. 357)
The liberal ideology that is decidedly in favor of unfet-
tered free markets makes it very apparent that any planning
practice seeking to address the redistributive injustice and
inequity of the free market is subject to considerable scrutiny
and countervailing pressure by dominant institutional and
private sector interests. As Markusen noted,
The urban planning profession is losing the battle with
economics for the shaping of urban space in part because
planners value equity as a normative criterion, whereas
economics values market efficiency. Efficiency has won out in
whatever war of values might have taken place. (Markusen,
2000, as cited by Thomas, 2008, p. 227)
Navigating the realities of the economic markets and the
political environment becomes a key attribute of the plan-
ning practitioner's reality and is of significant concern for
those seeking to infuse social justice and equity priorities
into their practice. A series of writings by planning scholars
in the Spring 1994 volume of the American Planning
Association Journal examined in retrospect Paul Davidoff's
notion of advocacy planning.1 It was evident that the
advancement of equity and social justice objectives remained
salient, if not fundamental to the vision of planning as con-
ceived by Davidoff and advanced by many others, even
though the various commentators articulate their own unique
insights and challenges associated with implementing
Davidoff's social-justice-oriented planning approach. What is
also evident from those commentaries is that the relevance
and contribution of planning practice rest on the core values
of inclusion, equity, and justice that form the democratic con-
text in which planning must be positioned.Also manifested in
the commentaries are a set of ideals closely held by an earlier
generation of planning scholars and practitioners who con-
sciously embrace their role as change agents (Thomas, 2006,
pp. 314-315).
Social Justice and Equity Pedagogy and the
Training of Urban Planning Professionals
Progressive planning professionals, academics, and practitio-
ners alike, many of whom whose worldviews were shaped by
their experience with or being youthful observers of the civil
rights movement, recognize that today's planning students
may have little or no framework to draw upon, which allows
them to understand or translate principles of social justice and
equity into practice (Thomas, 2006, pp. 314-315). Moreover,
there is concern that today's planning students, many of
whom grew up in the post-civil rights era, may have little
interest or disposition toward issues of equity and social jus-
tice. This concern is heightened as there is a growing percep-
tion that the United States is now moving into a post-racial
era with the election of its first African American president,
suggesting that issues related to discrimination, social disad-
vantage, and equity are becoming less relevant for planners
and the discipline as a whole. Thomas (2006), who is recog-
nized for her scholarship related to advancing diversity and
progressive ideals in the planning field through pedagogical
means, and who is also a proponent for aggressive recruit-
ment of diverse individuals within the student body and plan-
ning school faculty, suggests the planning field would be
better positioned to advance issues of equity and social justice
if it were more racially diverse. She contends that increasing
diversity within the planning field would heighten the "moti-
vation" of the field to champion the cause of equity and social
justice; at present, this is not occurring to the degree it should
because the "pain" of those diverse communities is often "left
at the door" and never allowed to cross the threshold into the
planning process (Thomas, 2008, p. 234).
Harris 3
Professional urban planners serve an important role in cit-
ies, often acting as facilitators and mediators in rationalizing
the use of urban space, the deployment of municipal and
community resources, and the allocation of community and
economic development opportunities. Arguably, planners
must achieve these objectives by asserting their role as a
mediating influence that balances the needs and interests of
private sector stakeholders with efforts to promote the greater
public good.2 The balancing of the public good with the
needs and interests of private stakeholders essentially trans-
lates into the ultimate distribution of costs and benefits
within communities, which of course has tremendous bear-
ing on equity and social justice outcomes. The professional
planning code of ethics requires practitioners to consider
issues of race, class, and gender as a context for advancing
social justice and equity. There is an expectation that stu-
dents will be equipped in their training to engage and man-
age equity matters within the context of their professional
practice. Although there are numerous skills, technical capa-
bilities, and various sensibilities that planning instructors
must help students develop to ensure their effectiveness as
planning professionals, there is also a firmly held belief that
it is equally critical for those teaching in planning schools
today to help students develop a concern for social justice
before they enter professional life (Thomas, 2006).
According to a 2011 Association of Collegiate Schools of
Planning (ACSP) Diversity Taskforce Report, African
American and Latino faculty and students are grossly under-
represented inAmerican planning programs (Wubneh, 2011).
This suggests we should not only aggressively work to diver-
sify planning classrooms and planning faculties, but we must
also infuse the planning program curriculum with opportuni-
ties for students and faculty--all across the ethnic, racial,
gender, and economic spectrum--to understand the strug-
gles, the frustration, and inequalities that too often define the
experiences of low-income and working-class communities,
and particularly low-income communities of color.
Understanding how students think about issues of social jus-
tice and equity is the first step in moving students along a
continuum of development from a "polite appreciation" of
social justice and equity issues to a transformational internal-
ization of these issues as a mandate of professional practice.
Research Question
The question this exploratory research investigated was
threefold: (a) what are the fundamental opinions, beliefs, and
values that urban planning students hold related to social jus-
tice and equity issues; (b) how does academic instruction
influence the beliefs, opinions, and values of urban planning
students, as well as support their embracing of social justice
and equity issues in their professional practice; and (c) how
do students generally feel about how well social justice and
equity issues are integrated into the instruction and the cur-
riculum of their program?
Research Methods
Survey Design
This study involved a survey (see Appendix A) of first and
second year Master of Urban Planning (MUP) students. The
survey queried MUP students on their opinions, beliefs, and
values related to social justice and equity in the context of
their roles as aspiring urban planning professionals. The sur-
vey was distributed during the initial and final semesters of
the students' tenure in the program to gain an understanding
of the influence of the program on student social justice per-
spectives. The MUP classes were defined by the year the stu-
dents entered in the program. The class of 2008 was sampled
prior to students exiting the program, the class of 2009 was
sampled both in the first and final semesters of the program,
and the class of 2010 was sampled during the initial semester
of the program. This stratified sampling technique allowed
for the capturing of students across three different class years.
The survey included 10 multiple choice questions and one
open-ended question that asked students to offer suggestions
on how the MUP program might improve on its curriculum
in dealing with issues of race, class, gender, and other social
justice-related topics. Six of the survey questions (Questions
1-6) aimed to measure the students' attitudes toward social
justice and equity by offering students mini-vignettes for
them to respond to, which measured the intensity of their
support for social justice and equity themes. Questions 1 and
2 sought to gauge student perspectives on the role of profes-
sional planners in propagating social justice and equity ide-
als. Question 3 assessed student perspectives on the scope
and purpose of planning intervention in the context of equity
and social justice. Questions 4 and 5 evaluated student beliefs
related to the efficacy of planners in advancing social justice
and equity outcomes in their practice. Question 6 sought to
highlight student perspectives on the academic instruction
strategies that encourage awareness and exploration of social
justice and equity issues. The intensity levels of student
responses were characterized as a low, moderate, or high
level of social justice activism toward social justice and
equity themes. Four questions (Questions 7-10) gathered
predictor information about the students' background, such
as comfort discussing topics related to social justice and
equity, earlier educational exposure to social justice and
equity themes, student perceptions as to whether social jus-
tice and equity concerns will be relevant to their professional
practice or work experience, and student perceptions of the
effectiveness of their graduate level program in addressing
issues of social justice and equity.
Sample
Table 1 shows the total enrollment of students in the MUP
program during the period of the administration of the sur-
vey. As we observe, 58 (85%) of the students in the program
are White, with White men and White women comprising
4 SAGE Open
62% and 23%, respectively, of the total population of stu-
dents. The MUP program had one African American student,
two Native American students, three Asian American stu-
dents, three Latino students, and one foreign-born student
comprising 1.5%, 2.9%, 4.4%, 4%, and 1.5%, respectively,
of the total population of students.
Table 2 shows the demographic distribution for the first and
second year classes of students who were surveyed. The
demographics for the first and second year classes illustrates
that within both classes substantially more than 50% of the
students are White men, with White women comprising 20%
or more of the student sample. In terms of the racial demo-
graphics, there are no significant differences in the racial com-
position of the first and second year classes. Therefore, we
would not expect any difference between the first and second
year student response rates based on class demographics.
Analytical Methods
The survey data were combined according to when the stu-
dents were surveyed; thus individual response data were
combined so that the responses from individuals just begin-
ning the program (i.e., first year students) were aggregated,
and responses from individuals who were in their second
year and who had completed the program were aggregated.
This allowed us to compare the responses of students who
were at the beginning of their tenure to those who were com-
pleting their tenure in the MUP program. To summarize the
results of the closed-ended survey responses, descriptive sta-
tistics were developed. Bar charts were produced to assess
the aggregate response patterns and differences in responses
of students who were in their initial year of the MUP pro-
gram as compared with the responses of students who were
completing the program. A series of chi-square tests were
conducted to determine whether there were significant dif-
ferences in the responses between first and second year stu-
dents and to determine whether there was any relationship
between student responses to Questions 1 through 6 and the
predictor data collected from student responses to Questions
7 to 10. Finally, responses to the open-ended questions were
analyzed by grouping them thematically and then undertak-
ing a thorough review of those responses.
Results
Student responses to the closed-ended questions were
assessed as being low, moderate, or high in terms of social
justice activism based on how supportive the student was of

the social justice and equity theme presented in Questions 1
to 6. Figures 1 and 2 compare the response distribution of
first and second year students to Questions 1 to 6 of the sur-
vey. The general trend is that both first and second year stu-
dents have a tendency to display moderate or high levels of
activism attitudes across all questions.
Over 75% of students from both the first and second grad-
uate class years express either a moderate- or high-level dis-
position toward social justice activism, as compared with the
approximately 20% to 25% of students who demonstrate a
disposition for low levels of activism relative to social justice
and equity. However, a more detailed comparison of the
responses from first and second year students indicates some
students' attitudes toward social justice shifted between their
initial and final years in the graduate program. The survey
distribution results suggest some fluctuation among respon-
dents identifying with moderate versus low levels of activ-
ism, with slightly more second year students having a
preference for low levels of activism attitudes and slightly
more first year students having a preference for moderate
levels of activism.
Thirty three percent of all students surveyed displayed a
disposition for high levels of activism, with the exceptions of
second year student responses in relationship to Question 4,
which assessed student perceptions of the efficacy of urban
planners. In Question 4, there was a decline in the percentage
of second year students who strongly believed in the efficacy
of planner, less than 25% as compared with their first year

counterparts whose percentages were at 35%. The percent-
age of high activism preferences varied by question, but nei-
ther class demonstrated a substantially greater preference for
high levels of activism. A substantial number of students
within the sample displayed a disposition for moderate levels
of activism.
Although there are similar trends in the social justice atti-
tudes of first and second year graduate classes, some differ-
ences in responses to particular questions were found.
Overall, first year students tended to be slightly more likely
to show moderate activism versus high activism disposition
when compared with second year students. In all questions
(except for Question 2, which examined students' perspec-
tive on the role of professional planners in propagating social
justice and equity ideals in the context historical patterns of
racial and gender discrimination and exclusion in the United
States), a greater percentage of first year students than sec-
ond year students selected a moderate response. With respect
to Question 5, which highlights the role of professional plan-
ners in addressing issues of economic and social justice, first
year students had a much larger moderate activism response
as compared with second year students, who tended to dis-
play a preference for low activism. Questions 3 and 4 asked
students about their perspectives related to the role of plan-
ners in promoting equitable market outcomes and the power
of planners to influence policy decisions, respectively. For
both of these questions, moderate social justice activism atti-
tudes were markedly greater in first year students compared
with second year students.
Overall, the survey distribution results suggest that a
slightly greater number of second year students demonstrated
a low activism disposition when compared with first year
students. In all questions except for Questions 6 and 2 (that
dealt with instructional strategies that encourage social jus-
tice awareness and the planner's role in propagating social
justice given historic patterns of racial and gender inequality,
respectively), no students selected a low activism response.
More second year students showed a disposition toward low-
level activism compared to their first year counterparts. This
pattern reveals that while the majority of students held mod-
erate or high activist stances in both their initial and final
years in the program, there was a shift among some students
in their second year of the program, more second year stu-
dents demonstrated a lower level activism disposition toward
social justice issues as those students neared completion of
the master's program. Consequently, the results may indicate
that some students become more neutral or dispassionate
about social justice and equity issues as they progress to the
final year of the program.
Mean Values of Social Justice Activism Responses
The mean values of response percentages of first and second
year students were compared to examine how the program
curriculum may have influenced student perceptions regard-
ing social justice activism. Table 3 shows the trends in the
mean values associated with the student responses.
Notwithstanding the aforementioned difference between first
and second year student responses discussed earlier, there
appears to be no statistically significant distinction between
Year 1 and Year 2 students with respect to their attitudes
toward social justice activism. The percentages of social jus-
tice disposition responses were also evaluated by year: first
year (initial year) and second year (final year) in the program.
It appears that matriculation through the MUP program does
not affect student disposition toward social activism.
Chi-Square Analysis of Predictor Data and Levels
of Student Disposition Toward Social Justice
Activism
Table 4 provides a snapshot of aggregate student responses
to the Predictor Questions 7 to 10. Student responses to the
predictor questions were categorized as low, moderate, or
high. A chi-square analysis was used to determine whether
any relationship exists between the four predictor variables
(as measured by Questions 7-10) and student responses to
the social justice activism categories (as measured by
Questions 1-6).
Table 5 highlights the relationship between students' dis-
position toward social justice activism and their level of
experience and exposure to social justice issues in previous
Harris 7
academic settings. Results suggest that for first year and sec-
ond year students, there appear to be no statistically signifi-
cant relationship between their former educational experience
and their disposition toward social justice activism.Although
a significant number of first year students with limited or no
exposure to social justice themes in their previous educa-
tional experience demonstrated a disposition toward high
levels of social justice activism, this was significantly less
true for second year students.
With respect to the connection between comfort level (as
it relates to discussing social justice issues) and student dis-
position toward activism, Table 6 suggests that there is no
relationship between levels of comfort and disposition
toward social justice activism for either first or second year
students. However, a significant number of first year stu-
dents who indicated a moderate to high level of comfort
engaging social justice themes also demonstrated a greater
disposition toward high social justice activism. This trend is
also present among second year students, with fewer stu-
dents expressing moderate comfort and more expressing
high levels of comfort with social justice themes. These sec-
ond year students also expressed a preference for a higher
level of social justice activism.
Although not statistically significant, the data in Table 7
illustrate that first and second year students who believe
equity issues will be or might possibly be important in their
work as a professional planner are more likely to express a
disposition toward a high level of social justice activism.
Finally, although not statistically significant, the findings in
Table 8 show a tendency for first and second year students
who indicate that the MUP program does a good job in
addressing equity issues to also display a disposition toward
high levels of social justice activism.
As discussed, matriculation through the MUP program did
not have any statistically significant effect on student disposi-
tion toward social activism. In addition, various predictor

variables did not prove to be statistically connected to the
student disposition toward social justice and equity.
Furthermore, there was no statistically significant relation-
ship between former educational experience and disposition
toward social justice activism. That said, some students who
showed more comfort toward engaging in social justice
issues also were more likely to have higher levels of activ-
ism. This finding suggests that these students' disposition
toward higher levels of social justice activism can be attrib-
uted to something outside of the realm of their classroom
experience, indicating the need for more experiential or more
applied learning opportunities.
It should be noted that the sample size may have limited
the usefulness of the results from this specific data survey.
However, the data trends in the study regarding the curricu-
lum's impact on student disposition toward social justice and
equity suggest that (a) the instruction on issues of social jus-
tice and equity in planning had little or no impact or (b) there
were not enough classes or opportunities for discussion
about social justice and equity in the program to create a sus-
tained resonance with the students.

The final question on the survey was open-ended, asking stu-
dents to offer ideas related to integrating race, class, and gen-
der issues into the MUP program curriculum. Students
offered a number of thoughts, reflections, and strategies for
improving the delivery and approach to promoting social
justice and equity themes within the instructional framework
of the curriculum.
The students' comments were organized into four basic
categories:
·
· Appreciating the complexity of the social justice
dialogue
·
· Preparation for the social justice dialogue
·
· Advancing strategies for teaching and learning as it
relates to social justice issues
·
· Exploring new instructional options for supporting
discussion of social justice and equity issues
Appreciating the Complexity of the Social Justice
Dialogue
The program discusses the issue but places little emphasis on
how to respond to it. The program is too focused on the built
form of planning rather than on issues that are often unseen.
Students often acknowledged the complexity of the social
justice dialogue, as evidenced by one student's question: " . . .
how do we balance the need to be neutral and technical
experts, yet incorporate social justice into that?" They saw
that social justice comprises areas of emphasis including
environmental problems, class issues, education, affordable
housing, safe living environments, and more. Students stated
that race and class issues are becoming even more important

today, and that it is important to not overlook the historical
context of socioeconomic issues. Students desired more dis-
cussions to address these issues essential to planning prac-
tice. Examples mentioned for study were the intertwining of
environmental problems and social justice, mixed-income
neighborhood planning, and practical ways to address social
justice issues in everyday planning practice.
Preparation for the Social Justice Dialogue
Overall, I think educators still believe it is a "touchy" subject
and may try to shy away from it. However, I feel it is relevant to
learn/talk about it. Personally, when in a group of all whites I
feel comfortable talking about it, but when I am in a mixed
group, I feel uncomfortable and slightly embarrassed.
Rather than shying away from dialogue about social justice,
students embraced it and lamented that the academic program
did not do more to foster it. They wanted social justice to be
directly addressed in class and wanted professors to have train-
ing on how to facilitate these types of discussions. Some stu-
dents felt social justice and equity issues were only discussed in
classes as tangential side topics and others noted a lack of com-
fort in discussing sensitive issues of race and class, especially
with other students of a much different background.
Advancing Strategies for Teaching and Learning
as it Relates to Social Justice Issues
[LOCATION] is a place full of local race, class and gender
issues. More real local examples would be helpful to hit the
point home.
Students expressed an awareness of the fact that their class
lacked racial and ethnic diversity and wished for more opportu-
nities to discuss social justice and equity issues in class. They
acknowledged privilege and felt it was important for them to get
out of the classroom and their comfort zones and into the com-
munity. Students wanted case studies, seminars, and a required
social justice course that directly works on building solutions
and strategies that address social and economic inequality.
Exploring New Instructional Options for
Supporting Exploration Into Social Justice Themes
I think one of the Planning Policy Analysis course cases should
be centered on these issues (one or all of them) to give us some
practical experience to go along with what we have learned in
class. Hearing about the issues and actually experiencing the
difficulties associated with solving/improving them are very
different, and I believe that could be addressed while we are still
in the structured and controlled setting that the program provides.
Some students expressed their desire for a class dedicated
to social justice and equity issues. Many believed such a class
should be mandatory and that the urban planning program
should suggest classes for them to take outside of the pro-
gram if none were available within urban planning. Students
wanted to see topics of race, class, and gender discussed in
less of an abstract context and in more historical and practi-
cal ways. They wanted applied classes so they would be able
to serve their community at large while being exposed to race
and class issues in a controlled and structured environment.
Suggestions were made for the planning program to connect
with community leaders who are already working on issues
of social justice and equity: "We need real-life case studies
dealing with these issues. Also, dealing with race, class, and
gender issues require a base knowledge of economics and
political science, so incorporating these into the curriculum
would be beneficial as well."
The students'comments and reflections offer some impor-
tant insights for instructional and pedagogical consider-
ations. In general, students believe social justice issues need
to be given more emphasis and support, with higher levels of
specificity and regularity in terms of course materials, class
discussion, and opportunities to be exposed to community
and professional stakeholders who navigate the complexities
of social justice issues in their daily lives and/or practice.
Students express a desire for effectively facilitated, frank,
and balanced discourse about social justice and equity that is
solution oriented and practice focused. Students also
expressed an interest in having more courses available to
them specifically dedicated to social justice issues and
themes: "I think issues of race, class, and gender should be
directly addressed through instruction when talking about
planning. It's important! Instruction on diversity topics by
diverse instructors educated on the issues."
Comparing these qualitative comments with the quantita-
tive findings, it is fair to conclude that urban planning pro-
grams should look for ways to better integrate social justice
and equity topics into their current coursework and to poten-
tially establish a new class or classes focusing exclusively on
urban social justice. Because students with greater comfort
levels involving discussion are also likely to be more ori-
ented toward social justice, instructors should find ways for
these students to help lead discussions. All students will
enter discussions with different comfort levels, and it is
important to create a safe atmosphere.
Planning programs might also consider surveying their
new students and graduating students on an ongoing basis to
track changes in social justice activism, and to make changes
to the curriculum accordingly. Programs also have to be stra-
tegic in terms of increasing the confidence of second year
individuals who might experience a drop in confidence from
Year 1 to Year 2 in term of being able to integrate social jus-
tice and equity practices into their professional career.
There is a likelihood that second year students' confidence
levels declined because they gained a greater understanding of
the political issues that can stand in the way of change.
Educators should inspire students and ensure social-justice-
and equity-focused planning education prepares students for
10 SAGE Open
the challenges ahead so that students are empowered and not
discouraged by the difficulties and barriers they may con-
front in advancing a social justice and equity agenda as an
important component of their professional practice.
Conclusion
We should be exposed to more situations where there are persons
of different races/classes to feel out what it is like to do work in
that context.
This exploratory study offers some interesting insights
into the disposition of graduate planning students toward
social justice activism. Survey results showed students of all
races and genders are very much in tune with and care about
issues related to social justice and equity. The first and sec-
ond year class cohorts of the MUP program covered under
this study displayed moderate to high levels of support for
the application of social justice and equity issues in the con-
text of their training as professional planners. A significant
number of students in the class cohorts covered by the survey
tended to enter into the MUP program with a disposition
toward high levels of social justice activism. This was true
even when they had limited or no exposure to social justice
issues in their previous academic experiences. It appears the
MUP program attracts planning students who have support-
ive views of social justice activism within the context of
planning practice. However, as students matriculated through
the program, the curriculum did not appear to have much
effect on the disposition of students toward social justice
activism. Notably, second year students displayed more of a
tendency toward low levels of social justice activism. This
may suggest that if students are introduced to complex social
justice concepts but are not also given strategies to navigate
the realities of these issues within their professional practice,
they may default to a disposition toward lower levels of
social justice activism.
A significant number of students felt moderately comfort-
able talking about issues related to race, class, and gender
and also believed that issues of social justice will possibly be
important in their practice as professional planners, which is
certainly an important foundation upon which to build from
a pedagogical vantage point. In the words of one respondent,
"Talking about it in the classroom helps, but getting us out of
our comfort zone will do more." There was a mixed opinion
among students about the effectiveness of the program with
respect to engaging issues around social justice. However,
there was a general sense that more applied and practical
knowledge related to these issues would serve students more
effectively as they prepare for professional practice:
I think the program addresses these concepts well enough in
class, but could put more emphasis on how to work for these
concepts in a tangible way. Race and class issues are especially
difficult to approach, since those are usually multi-faceted
problems.
That said, many students also expressed an interest in
being challenged and inspired to promote social justice and
equity in their professional practice. Moreover, many stu-
dents from the first and second year classes indicated they
would be working for organizations after graduation where
issues of race, class, and gender would be important consid-
erations within their work.
The findings of this study are limited but encouraging.
Planning students continue to show interest in upholding val-
ues of social justice within the context of their planning prac-
tice. The comments from students, which capture some of
the qualitative aspects of the research, suggests that student
input can play a significant and strategic role in helping plan-
ning programs consider how instructional and pedagogical
approaches might be improved to better support student
learning. This is an important charge for faculty within plan-
ning schools, which deserves to be taken seriously. More
research is needed to perfect strategies for introducing and
managing social justice and equity issues and themes within
the planning curriculum. These issues related to social
justice and equity are only becoming far more complex,
nuanced, and challenging to understand and manage. Future
research might focus on surveying a larger sample of stu-
dents across a few planning schools to see if the trends sug-
gested here are generalizable and provide insight for
recommended changes to planning programs that could be
advocated for and adopted.

Open-Ended Questionnaire Responses
Appreciating the Complexity of the Social Justice Dialogue
·
· "As professionals how do we balance the need to be
neutral and technical experts, yet incorporate social
justice into that?"
·
· "The department does a good job of bringing social
justice issues to the forefront. Although, I believe it is
important to balance social justice along with the
other facets of planning. Not drown out other impor-
tant discussions."
·
· "Want more discussion on environmental issues and
social justice. Locating of factories or pollutant trad-
ing near economically depressed or minority areas.
How do we plan for infrastructure in relationship to
these areas?"
·
· "I think class issues are becoming more relevant today
and are much more often overlooked. Mixed income
neighborhood planning would be really interesting to
study--both how it could be successful and why it
isn't attempted often in the United States."
·
· "The program discusses the issue but places little
emphasis on how to respond to it. The program is too
focused on the built form of planning rather than on
issues that are often unseen."
·
· "Critical to make clear to students gender, racial, and
socioeconomic problems of the past are not fully
resolved because we feel the impacts of that legacy in
the way our world is organized today, that is, who has
power, who is politically active, the segregation of cit-
ies, and the complete disproportionate sharing of eco-
nomic factors such as the means of production. Also,
access to proper/good education, affordable housing,
and a safe environment."
Preparation for the Social Justice Dialogue
·
· "Overall, I think educators still believe it is a `touchy'
subject and may try to shy away from it. However, I
feel it is relevant to learn/talk about it. Personally,
when in a group of all Whites I feel comfortable talk-
ing about it, but when I am in a mixed group, I feel
uncomfortable and slightly embarrassed."
·
· "Consider cultural sensitivity training, cross-training
with different programs, and prepare professors to
facilitate and discuss these issues."
·
· "Teach as part of courses but do not preach."
·
· "I think issues of race, class, and gender should be
directly addressed through instruction when talking
about planning. It's important! Instruction on diver-
sity topics by diverse instructors educated on the
issues."
·
· "I have not been exposed to many classes yet. However,
of the classes I have had, there doesn't seem to be as
much discussion of race, class, or gender as there could
be. A lot of times, it seems to be brought up as an aside
or an afterthought. I have had a lot of educational back-
ground with issues of diversity so I may share a differ-
ent viewpoint from others. I really believe the program
needs to make more effort to not just educate students
about diversity but to also have open, engaging discus-
sions about it. People can be scared to do this at first,
but it is the only way you can start to get comfortable
with issues that initially feel very uncomfortable."
Advancing Strategies for Teaching and Learning as It Relates to
Social Justice Issues
·
· "We all understand the problems--but only in limited
capacity. I think there should be more invitations to
planning professionals who face political/economic
hurdles in addressing the issues of race/class."
·
· "For a largely privileged, White class to understand
race, there has to be more interaction. A required class
dealing with social justice with a project in a minority
neighborhood that deals with structural issues. Talking
about it in the classroom helps, but getting us out of
our comfort zone will do more."
·
· "[LOCATION] is a place full of local race, class, and
gender issues. More real local examples would be
helpful to hit the point home."
·
· "Emphasize solutions to inequities more."
·
· "By providing seminars in related topics where profes-
sionally how to apply it should be properly understood."
·
· "Continue with the discussion, but combine it with
more case studies from around the nation."
·
· "I think the program addresses these concepts well
enough in class, but could put more emphasis on how
to work for these concepts in a tangible way. Race and
class issues are especially difficult to approach, since
those are usually multi-faceted problems."
·
· "We should be exposed to more situations where there
are persons of different races/classes to feel out what
it is like to do work in that context."
·
· "Try to enroll more women and minorities into the
program, if possible. Highlight women and minorities
in lectures/discussion/readings. Mix-up classroom
activities."
New Instructional Infrastructure for Supporting Exploration Into
Social JusticeThemes
·
· "Dedicate a specific course solely to social justice
issues."
·
· "Explore more case studies related to these issues."
·
· "I think a mandatory ethnic studies component should
be enacted. I think these issues are central to things we
will encounter in our professional lives."
14 SAGE Open
·
· "We should add a mandatory core class which deals
with gender, race, equity, and the planning process--
both throughout history and currently."
·
· "Issues of diversity are often glossed over in class. I
believe that a multicultural/diversity issues class
should be required in the planning program."
·
· "Offer more courses on race issues. Have more mate-
rial on race presented during required courses. Maybe
have a `specialty' division of the MUP program that
deals with these issues. The program should suggest
courses if they're not available in School of
Architecture and Urban Planning."
·
· "I think one of the Planning Policy Analysis course
cases should be centered on these issues (one or all of
them) to give us some practical experience to go along
with what we have learned in class. Hearing about the
issues and actually experiencing the difficulties asso-
ciated with solving/improving them are very different,
and I believe that could be addressed while we are still
in the structured and controlled setting that the pro-
gram provides."
·
· "More discussions/reading about planning history/
theory that concern issues of race, class, and gender
issues and much more emphasis when discussing eco-
nomic tools that developers and planners use about
exactly what these data sets/calculations quantify and
the inherent class/racial assumptions within."
·
· "The first year, first semester approaches the issue on
a very abstract basis. Issues of social justice are men-
tioned, and equity/advocacy/participatory planning
methods are praised or deemed correct, without much
rational argument to support the conclusion. Although
we look at historical planning processes, not much is
said as to why, or what effect, these earlier planning
actions and theories contribute to our current situa-
tions. However, if it is a stated priority of the program,
then a mandatory class can be constructed to deal with
social stratification, inequality, and social justice
issues. I would say the most important thing is to get
out and get practical. You don't have to step far from
our East Side of [LOCATION] Ivory Tower to come
face to face with communities facing serious chal-
lenges in this regard. Get the planning program tightly
hooked up with CBOs working in these fields, and let
the students see how it's lived, and involved in the
efforts. This is a powerful opportunity for learning
and serving."
·
· "I think, at present the MUP program just touches
upon race/class and or gender issues with respect to
planning history. For a deeper understanding of these
issues, maybe a joint seminar or lecture series with the
sociology department may help.Also, at least, an over-
view on these issues on an international level is
required. This would offer a good platform to compare
social issues in America with other nations/regions
(developed or developing)."
·
· "I think the program as a whole does a good job
of discussing these issues. More focus could be
given to the specific segregation issues we face in
[LOCATION]."
·
· "We need real-life case studies dealing with these
issues. Also, dealing with race, class, and gender
issues require a base knowledge of economics and
political science, so incorporating these into the cur-
riculum would be beneficial as well.

the definition of the "public good" and what we mean when we
