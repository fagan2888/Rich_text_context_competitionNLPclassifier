Abstract
Background: Studies have suggested that CMV infection may influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and mortality.
However, there have been no large-scale examinations of these relationships among demographically diverse populations.
The inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) is also linked with CVD outcomes and mortality and may play an
important role in the pathway between CMV and mortality. We utilized a U.S. nationally representative study to examine
whether CMV infection is associated with all-cause and CVD-related mortality. We also assessed whether CRP level mediated
or modified these relationships.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Data come from subjects $25 years of age who were tested for CMV and CRP level and
were eligible for mortality follow-up on December 31st, 2006 (N = 14153) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) III (1988­1994). Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) for all-cause and CVD-related mortality by CMV serostatus. After adjusting for multiple confounders,
CMV seropositivity remained statistically significantly associated with all-cause mortality (HR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.41). The
association between CMV and CVD-related mortality did not achieve statistical significance after confounder adjustment.
CRP did not mediate these associations. However, CMV seropositive individuals with high CRP levels showed a 30.1% higher
risk for all-cause mortality and 29.5% higher risk for CVD-related mortality compared to CMV seropositive individuals with
low CRP levels.
Conclusions/Significance: CMV was associated with a significant increased risk for all-cause mortality and CMV seropositive
subjects who also had high CRP levels were at substantially higher risk for both for all-cause and CVD-related mortality than
subjects with low CRP levels. Future work should target the mechanisms by which CMV infection and low-level
inflammation interact to yield significant impact on mortality.

Introduction
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a highly transmissible and prevalent
beta herpesvirus [1,2]. This pathogen is never cleared from the
body, persisting in a number of tissues via hypothesized
mechanisms including chronic productive infection and/or latent
infection with periodic subclinical reactivation [2,3]. Recently,
CMV has been linked to a variety of chronic diseases with an
inflammatory component including cardiovascular disease (CVD)
[4­7], cancer [8,9], cognitive decline including vascular dementia
[10,11] and functional impairment [12­14].
Several mechanisms have been hypothesized to link CMV
infection and CVD in both human and animal studies [15­20].
CMV antigen and DNA have been identified in atherosclerotic
vessels of the human cardiovascular system [21­23] and murine
models suggest an inflammatory link with CVD progression
[19,20]. It has been hypothesized that CMV either directly infects
the vessels of the heart and replicates at low levels, or is delivered
to the vessel wall by infected circulating monocytes arriving at sites
of cardiovascular injury or inflammation [24]. The presence of
CMV in the vessel walls may induce smooth muscle cell
proliferation and migration, increased uptake of oxidized low-
density lipoprotein and expression of cytokines and chemokines as
well as increased procoagulant activity by endothelial cells
[16,17,25,26]. CMV may also cause vascular damage without
direct invasion as a result of molecular mimicry, whereby viral
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e16103
antigens trigger an immune response cross-reacting on self-
peptides expressed on uninfected host tissues [16,27,28]. For
example, two CMV-derived proteins, UL122 and US28, are
homologous to an amino acid sequence at position 153­160 of
heat shock protein (HSP) 60 [29,30]. Thus, infection with CMV
may contribute to progression of atherosclerosis and other CVD
health outcomes via several mechanisms.
CMV has also been associated with other chronic diseases of
aging, including physical impairment, cognitive decline and cancer
[8­14]. The specific mechanisms responsible for these associations
have not been fully elucidated, but are likely to have an immune
and inflammatory component. Indeed, CMV seropositivity
belongs to a cluster of immune factors constituting an ``immune
risk profile'' associated with all-cause mortality at 2, 4 and 6-year
follow-up in elderly Swedes in the OCTO/NONA longitudinal
studies [31­34]. CMV is a driver of age-associated immune
changes in elderly populations which lead to a reduction in the
number of nai
¨ve T cells available for fighting new infections [34­
37]. Reactivations or superinfections may result in higher titers of
CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and increased levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) [38­40]. C-reactive protein (CRP)
levels also increase as a consequence of reactivation or leakage of
the virus from host cells, via the action of IL-6 produced in the
liver [17,41­43]. These inflammatory markers have been linked to
both all-cause and CVD-related mortality [44­46]. Thus, CMV
may impact both CVD-related and all-cause mortality through its
affects on chronic inflammatory and immune-related changes seen
with aging.
Although not all studies have supported a relationship between
CMV and chronic disease outcomes [47,48], a majority of
published studies have reported a significant relationship between
CMV and mortality, in conjunction with markers of inflammation
[14,49­52]. A recent study by Roberts et al., examined the
relationship between CMV antibody titer and all-cause/CVD
mortality among elderly Latinos finding that subjects with CMV
IgG antibody titers in the highest quartile had 1.43 (95% CI: 1.14,
1.79) times higher risk for all-cause mortality and 1.35 (95% CI:
1.01, 1.80) times higher risk for CVD mortality in models adjusted
for age, gender, education and comorbidity index [49]. The
authors found the effect of CMV on mortality was partially
mediated by a composite measure of two inflammatory markers,
TNF-a and IL-6, but not CRP since it was unrelated to mortality
in their study population [49]. In contrast, Blankenberg et al.
found CMV to be associated with cardiac mortality among
persons with existing coronary artery disease (CAD) only in
subjects with elevated IL-6 levels (hazard ratio (HR) 3.2, 95%
confidence interval (CI): 1.4, 7.3) and not in those without IL-6
elevation, suggesting effect modification by IL-6 in the association
between CMV and CVD-related mortality [52]. Also examining
the effect of CMV antibody titers on mortality, Strandberg et al.
assessed 7-year risk for mortality in a small cohort of community-
dwelling 75­90 year-olds with underlying CVD in Finland [50].
The authors found that mortality was significantly greater among
subjects in the highest CMV IgG quartile, compared with the
lowest quartile and that this association remained significant after
controlling for several covariates including CRP, suggesting that
CRP did not mediate this pathway [50]. Furthermore, Muhlestein
et al. examined the association between seropositivity to CMV, H.
pylori and Chlamydia pneumonia infections, as well as high CRP level
and mortality among patients with a mean age of 65 years that
were predominantly male and had angiographically demonstrated
CAD [51]. Of the three pathogens assessed, only seropositivity to
CMV was significantly predictive of mortality. The authors also
found that risk for mortality was greatest among CMV seropositive
subjects with CRP levels in the highest tertile, suggesting a joint
effect of CMV seropositivity and high CRP level on mortality
among their sample of individuals with underlying CAD [51].
Even though these studies suggest an association between CMV,
inflammation and mortality, they were conducted in predomi-
nantly older age populations, of specific gender or race/ethnic
groups and/or among participants who have underlying CAD or
CVD health conditions. While one cross-sectional study conducted
among a U.S. population-based cohort of individuals aged 45 and
older found that CMV was associated with reported history of
CVD, it remains unclear whether a temporal relationship exists
between CMV and mortality in the U.S. population [6].
Moreover, the role of inflammatory markers such as IL-6, TNF-
a and CRP as mediators or effect modifiers of the relationship
between CMV and mortality is unclear [14,49­52]. Some studies
support mediation by these markers, while others suggest effect
modification [14,49­52]. Therefore, research examining whether
inflammatory markers mediate or modify the relationship between
CMV and mortality in the U.S. is needed.
The purpose of this study was to examine whether seropositivity
for CMV predicts all-cause as well as CVD-related mortality and
whether CRP mediated or modified these relationships in a
nationally representative U.S. population of individuals aged 25
and older.
Methods
Ethics statement
The University of Michigan Institutional Review Board
approved this study HUM00013336.
Study population
Data come from the National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) III (1988­1994), a population-based,
multistage stratified probability survey which collects information
on the health and nutrition of the United States civilian
noninstitutionalized population. The survey was carried out by
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and is meant to be representative
of the U.S. population. In addition, we used data from the
NHANES III-Linked Mortality file in which the mortality status of
NHANES III participants, $17 years of age, was determined by
probabilistic matching between NHANES III participants and the
U.S. National Death Index (NDI) [53].
A total of 33994 subjects were interviewed in NHANES III.
Our study sample is limited to subjects that were 25 years of age
and older (range 25­90 years of age) at time of examination
(N = 15242 (48.7%)), were tested for CMV serostatus and CRP
level (N = 14164 (92.9%)) and eligible for mortality follow-up on
December 31st, 2006 (N = 14153 (99.9%). Forty-eight subjects
(0.3%) were excluded from the analyses of CVD-related mortality
because their cause of death could not be ascertained.
Laboratory Analyses
CMV-specific IgG was measured by a commercially available
Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) (Quest Interna-
tional, Inc., Miami, FL). Sera with values near the ELISA cutoff
were confirmed with a second ELISA assay (bioMerieux, Inc.,
Durham, NC). If the results from the first two tests disagreed, an
Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) (Bion International, Inc., Park
Ridge, IL), was used and results from this test were provided as the
final seropositivity test result. The sensitivity and specificity of
these tests have been estimated to be 98% and 99%, respectively

[1,54]. Although CMV IgG and IgM antibody titer levels are
available in NHANES III, values for subjects over age 49 were
top-coded, making them unusable as a predictor of mortality.
Sera collected for the purpose of CRP testing were stored at -70
C and analyzed within 2 months using a modification of the
Behring Latex-Enhanced CRP assay on the Behring Nephelom-
eter Analyzer systemTM (Behring Diagnostics, Westwood, MA).
Both within and between-assay quality control procedures were
used and the coefficient of variation was 3.2%­16.1% through the
period of data collection. The limit of detection for CRP was
0.3 mg/dL [55].
Sera collected for the purpose of cholesterol testing were frozen
and stored at -20 C, then shipped on dry ice within four weeks to
the Johns Hopkins University Lipid Research Clinic Laboratory
which participates in the Lipid Standardization Program of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Total cholesterol was
measured enzymatically on a Hitachi 717 analyzer using a
commercially available reagent mixture (Boehringer Manheim
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) [55].
Measures
Results from the CMV IgG antibody tests were dichotomized as
seronegative or seropositive based on the ELISA results. Results
from the CRP tests were dichotomized as low: ,0.3 mg/dL and
high: $0.3 mg/dL according to commonly used cut-off values
thought to have clinical significance for prediction of heart attack
or stroke [56]. Combined CMV serostatus and CRP level was
categorized as CMV seronegative/low CRP, CMV seronegative/
high CRP, CMV seropositive/low CRP and CMV seropositive/
high CRP.
Mortality status was obtained primarily from the NDI; however,
other sources of mortality status included indication of deceased
status from the Social Security Administration, the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services, or death certificate review [53].
Cause of death was coded using the International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) up until 1998 and ICD-10 for
1999­2006. All deaths before 1999 were recoded by the NCHS
into comparable ICD-10 codes [57]. ICD-10 codes I00-I99 were
classified as CVD-related deaths and included, causes of death
such as hypertensive heart disease, atherosclerosis including
coronary and cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, and aortic
aneurysms. Persons who survived the entire follow-up period were
administratively censored on December, 31st 2006. Follow-up time
for each person was calculated as the difference between the
NHANES III examination date and the last known date alive or
censored [57]. Persons who died of non-CVD causes were
considered censored at the date of death for CVD mortality
analysis.
Covariates hypothesized to be potential confounders of the
relationship between CMV serostatus and mortality included age,
gender, race/ethnicity, country of origin, body mass index (BMI)
(kg/m2), smoking status, diabetes status and education level,
because these factors have been shown to predict both risk for
infection and mortality [1,58­62]. Age in years at examination was
self-reported and treated as a continuous variable. Gender was
dichotomized as female and male. Race/ethnicity was self-
reported as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-
American or Other. Country of origin was reported as the state or
foreign country in which subjects were born and was categorized
as U.S. or Other. Education level was chosen as a marker of life
course socioeconomic position most likely to precede CMV
infection and self-reported as years of education and treated as
continuous [63,64]. BMI (kg/m2) was computed from weight and
standing height and categorized as BMI ,25, 25# BMI ,30 and
BMI $30. Smoking status was self-reported and categorized into
never (did not smoke 100+ cigarettes in one's lifetime), past
(smoked 100+ cigarettes in one's lifetime but do not currently
smoke) and current smoker (smoked 100+ cigarettes in one's
lifetime and currently smoke). Diabetes was self-reported as
whether a doctor ever informed subjects they had diabetes or
not and dichotomized as reported or not reported. In addition, use
of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) was hypothe-
sized as a confounder in the association between the combined
effect of CMV serostatus/CRP level and mortality [65,66].
Subjects were considered to use NSAIDs if they reported use of
prescription drugs in the past month with a primary classification
of NSAID according to the Product Information Branch, Center
for Drug Evaluation and Research at the U.S. DHHS Food and
Drug Administration or if subjects self-reported taking any Advil,
Nuprin, Medipren or Ibuprofen in the past month [67].
Total serum cholesterol and hypertension were hypothesized as
mediators in the pathway between the combined effect of CMV
serostatus/CRP level and CVD-related mortality. Serum total
cholesterol level was dichotomized as low (,240 mg/dL) and high
($240 mg/dL) according to the National Cholesterol Education
Program Expert Panel [68] and hypertension was reported as ever
having been told by a doctor or health professional that you had
hypertension, also called high blood pressure.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.2, with
SAS-callable SUDAAN, version 10.0.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary,
NC) [69]. All analyses used appropriate weights and adjustments
for strata and clustering used in the complex study design used in
NHANES III. Bivariate relationships between CMV serostatus,
CRP level, all-cause and CVD-related mortality and potential
confounders including age, gender, race/ethnicity, country of
origin, education level, BMI (kg/m2), smoking status, diabetes
status and NSAID use were assessed. Covariates were considered
confounders based on a priori hypotheses and if they were
associated with the exposure and associated with the outcome
among the unexposed [70]. T-tests (two-tailed) for difference in
means and Pearson chi-square tests of independence for
proportions and test for trend among demographic groupings
were calculated.
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted for all-cause and
CVD-related mortality by CMV serostatus to examine the
unadjusted association between CMV serostatus and all-cause/
CV-related mortality. Survival time was measured in months since
mobile or home examination. Cox proportional hazard models
were used to estimate the confounder adjusted HR and 95% CI
for the association between CMV serostatus and all-cause/CVD-
related mortality first in models adjusted for sociodemographic
factors (age, gender, race/ethnicity, country of origin and
education level), then, in models additionally adjusted for clinical
factors (BMI (kg/m2), smoking status and diabetes status and last
in models also controlling for CRP level. In order to assess whether
CRP level mediated the relationship between CMV and mortality
we compared the HR for all-cause and CVD-related mortality,
before and after controlling for CRP in the fully adjusted model.
Adjusted Wald F statistics were estimated to compare follow-up
time in months from exam to death between those CMV
seronegative versus CMV seropositive in fully adjusted models.
To assess whether CRP modified the relationship between
CMV and all-cause/CVD-related mortality we first examined the
crude association between combined CMV serostatus and CRP
level by plotting unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves for all-
cause and CVD-related mortality by combined CMV serostatus

and CRP level over the follow-up period. Survival time was
measured in months since mobile or home examination. Next we
used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the confounder
adjusted HR and 95% CI for the association between CMV
serostatus/CRP level and all-cause/CVD-related mortality first in
models adjusted for sociodemographic factors (age, gender, race/
ethnicity, country of origin and education level) and second, in
models adjusted for clinical factors (BMI (kg/m2), smoking status,
diabetes status and NSAID use). Last, adjusted Wald F statistics
were estimated to compare follow-up time in months from exam to
death between each combination of CMV serostatus and CRP
level, adjusting for covariates.
To examine whether more proximal risk factors for CVD,
including total cholesterol level and hypertension, lie in the
pathway between the combined effect of CMV seropositivity/high
CRP level and CVD-related mortality, we compared the HR for
CVD-related mortality for those CMV seropositive with high CRP
level to individuals that were CMV seronegative with low CRP
level, before and after controlling for these factors.
Results
Weighted estimates of the bivariate relationships between
covariates of interest and CMV serostatus are shown in Table 1.
The weighted proportion of those seropositive to CMV was 66.7%.
Higher mean age, female gender, non-white race/ethnicity, country
of origin outside the U.S., lower mean education level, low BMI
(,25 kg/m2) and high BMI ($30 kg/m2) compared to medium
BMI (25# BMI ,30), reported diabetes and high CRP level
($0.3 mg/dL) were associated with CMV seropositivity. Although

hypothesized as a potential confounder in the association between
CMV serostatus and mortality, smoking status was not associated
with CMV serostatus in our study. During the mean 13.7 years of
follow-up from exam, the population estimate for the proportion
dying from all causes was 18.9% and the proportion dying from
CVD-related mortality was 8.0%.
The unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves for all-cause
mortality by CMV serostatus are shown in Figures 1 and 2.
Overall mean survival duration since time of exam for those CMV
seropositive was 13.4 years (160.462.40 months) whereas mean
survival duration was 14.5 years (173.563.15 months) for CMV
seronegative subjects. Table S1. shows the HR and 95% CI from
Cox proportional hazard models examining the association
between CMV and all-cause/CVD-related mortality, mutually
adjusted for hypothesized confounders. After adjusting for age,
gender, race/ethnicity, country of origin, education level, BMI
(kg/m2), smoking status and diabetes status, CMV seropositivity
remained statistically significantly associated with all-cause mor-
tality (HR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.41) and follow-up time from
exam to death from all causes was significantly different between
CMV seronegative and CMV seropositive subjects (Adjusted Wald
F = 4.66, p-value = 0.0358) in model 2. The effect of CMV on all-
cause mortality was not further attenuated after controlling for
CRP level (HR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.40 versus HR 1.19, 95% CI:
1.01, 1.41). Although the magnitude of effect for CVD-related
mortality was similar to that of all-cause mortality, the association
between CMV and CVD-related mortality was not statistically
significant in the fully adjusted model and follow-up time from
exam to death from CVD-related mortality for those CMV
seropositive versus seronegative was not statistically significantly
different (Adjusted Wald F = 2.66, p-value = 0.1092). Similarly,
adjustment for CRP level did not further attenuate the association
between CMV and CVD-related mortality (HR 1.19, 95% CI:
0.95, 1.49 versus HR 1.19, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.49).
Figures 3 and 4 show the unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival
curves for all-cause and CVD-related mortality by the four
different permutations of CMV serostatus and CRP level. The
overall mean survival times from exam to mortality for each
combination of CMV serostatus and CRP level were 14.7 years
(176.063.20 months) for CMV seronegative individuals with low
CRP, 13.8 years (165.663.49 months) for CMV seronegative
individuals with high CRP, 13.8 years (165.562.46 months) for
CMV seropositive individuals with low CRP and 12.5 years
(150.063.49 months) for CMV seropositive individuals with high
CRP.
Table 2 shows the HR and 95% CI from Cox proportional
hazard models examining the association between different
permutations of CMV serostatus and CRP level and all-cause or
CVD-related mortality, adjusted for confounders. After adjust-
ment for age, gender, race/ethnicity, country of origin, education
level, BMI (kg/m2), smoking status, diabetes status and NSAID
use, the highest HR for all-cause and CVD-related mortality was
found among people who were both CMV seropositive and had
high CRP levels (HR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.31, 1.94, and HR 1.71, 95%
CI: 1.21, 2.42, respectively), compared to CMV seronegative
subjects with low CRP. Hence, even after confounder adjustment,

and diabetes status, follow-up time from exam to death from all causes was significantly different between CMV seronegative and CMV seropositive
subjects (Adjusted Wald F = 4.66, p-value = 0.0358). CMV = cytomegalovirus and MEC = mobile examination center.

subjects that were CMV seropositive and had high CRP had a
30.1% higher risk for all-cause mortality and 29.5% higher risk for
CVD-related mortality compared to CMV seropositive subjects
who had low CRP levels. The follow-up time from exam to death
from all-causes for CMV seropositive individuals with high CRP
was significantly different from CMV seropositive individuals with
low CRP (Adjusted Wald F = 36.19, p,0.0001) in fully adjusted
models. In addition, the follow-up time from exam to CVD-
related death for CMV seropositive individuals with high CRP was
significantly different from CMV seropositive individuals with low
CRP (Adjusted Wald F = 9.10, p = 0.0040) in fully adjusted
models. After adjustment for total cholesterol level and hyperten-
sion, the HR for CVD-related mortality among those CMV
seropositive with high CRP level compared to individuals that
were CMV seronegative with low CRP, was attenuated by 3.5%
(HR 1.65 95% CI: 1.16, 2.35, compared to HR 1.71, 95% CI:
1.21, 2.42).
Discussion
This study examined whether seropositivity for CMV, an
indicator of prior infection with this persistent herpesvirus,
predicts all-cause as well as CVD-related mortality and whether
CRP mediates or modifies this relationship in a nationally
representative U.S. population of individuals 25 years of age and
older. The results of our study suggest that CMV seropositivity is
independently associated with all-cause mortality, after control-
ling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, country of origin, education
level, BMI (kg/m2), smoking status and diabetes status.
Furthermore, adjustment for CRP level did not attenuate this
relationship.
After confounder adjustment, CMV serostatus was no longer
significantly associated with CVD mortality. It is possible that the
strong relationship between CMV and all-cause mortality
observed in this study indicates that CMV seropositive subjects
are dying of competing causes before they have the chance to
develop CVD, attenuating the relationship between CMV and
CVD-related mortality. High levels of CRP, however, augmented
the effect of CMV seropositivity on both all-cause and CVD-
related mortality. Among CMV seropositive subjects, those with
high CRP levels showed approximately a 30% higher risk for all-
cause mortality and for CVD-related mortality, compared to those
with low CRP levels. Adjusting for CVD risk factors such as high
total cholesterol and hypertension resulted in a moderate
attenuation (decrease of 3.5%) of the association between
combined CMV seropositivity and high CRP level and CVD-
related mortality, supporting the hypothesis that CMV seropos-
itivity along with subclinical inflammation impacts risk for
mortality in part through their combined contribution to other
more proximal CVD risk factors. Nonetheless, these markers of
CVD did not completely attenuate the association, indicating that
other factors may also be on the pathway or that there is a direct
relationship between CMV infection, CRP levels and CVD-
related mortality. Thus, our research suggests that efforts

identifying the mechanisms of these additive effects and targeted
CVD intervention studies among subpopulations with these
biomarker risk profiles are warranted.
It has been suggested that individuals who are CMV
seropositive and also have a subclinical inflammatory profile are
more susceptible to the atherogenic effects of CMV infection,
whereas those without a subclinical response are not as susceptible
[43,51]. Studies support a correlation between increased CRP and
increased CMV antibody titers- a marker of reactivation - but the
directionality among these two biological markers is unclear
[49,50,71]. If elevated CRP is a marker of ``reactivating'' CMV
infection, whereas low CRP indicates resolved or ``latent'' CMV
infection, we would expect CRP levels to be increased during
times of CMV reactivation and for CMV infection to be most
detrimental under these circumstances. Since CMV has been
found to directly invade cardiovascular tissues [21­23], periods of
CMV ``reactivation'' may accelerate the atherogenic process by
increasing the detrimental effects of tissue invasion such as smooth
muscle cell proliferation and migration [16,17,25,26]. On the
other hand, if, as hypothesized, molecular mimicry plays a role in
the relationship between CMV and CVD-mortality, the immune
system may become hyper-stimulated during periods of CMV
``reactivation'' leading to an exacerbated attack against host tissues
presenting cross-reacting human peptides [27­30]. For these
reasons, the greatest physiological harm caused by CMV is likely
to occur during ``reactivation'' events, possibly at a subclinical
level. If subclinical ``reactive'' CMV infection is most important in
the etiology of mortality, then situations that cause CMV
reactivation over the lifecourse, such as stress, inflammation
caused by co-infections, immunosuppression and aging may play
important key roles in determining the extent to which CMV
infection is detrimental to health.
Although CMV IgG and IgM antibody titer levels are available
in NHANES III, values for subjects over age 49 were top-coded,
making them unusable as a predictor of mortality. It was also not
possible to correlate antibody levels as an indicator of ``reactivat-
ing'' versus ``latent'' CMV infection in our study population. In
addition, approximately 64% of our study population had CRP
levels under the limit of detection (,0.3 mg/dl), because more
sensitive assays that are currently available for measurement of
high-sensitivity CRP below this limit of detection were not used in
NHANES III, making it difficult to examine CRP levels
continuously. Hence, one limitation of our study is that were
unable to examine the relationship between CMV antibody titer
and CRP level more closely, which might have allowed us to
identify a more precise interaction between CMV infection and
CRP levels and their effect on all-cause and CVD-related
mortality. Another limitation associated with using CRP as a
predictor of mortality is that very high values of CRP may
represent acute infection or injury not necessarily associated with
cardiovascular disease. In addition, the causal relations and
therapeutic implications pertaining to CRP and CVD are

currently unclear [72­75]. However, other inflammatory markers
that have been shown to play a significant role in the pathway
between CMV and mortality, such as IL-6, are not available in
NHANES III. Thus, it was not possible to determine whether
other inflammatory markers in addition to CRP mediate or
modify the relationship between CMV and mortality. Nonetheless,

our exposure of interest, CMV serostatus, was laboratory-
confirmed and CRP was measured by standard methodologies
[1,53,55].
Another limitation to our study is that we utilized the updated
NHANES III Linked Mortality Public-use File which was subject
to data perturbation in which synthetic data was substituted for the
actual date of death and underlying cause of death for selected
descendent records in order to reduce risk of respondent re-
identification [76]. Despite the data perturbation of date of death
for selected decedents in the public-use file, a comparison study
between the public-use and restricted-use file (which does not
contain perturbed data) conducted by the NCHS, found that
analysis of all-cause and cause-specific mortality (heart disease,
ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, in particular)
by sociodemographic factors including as age, sex, race/ethnicity
and education level to be comparable across files and concluded
that the discrepancies between the public-use and restricted-use
file were minor and that analysts should use the public-use file with
confidence [76]. Importantly, mortality status was rigorously
verified by two sources (National Death Index (NDI) and/or death
certificate review) [53]. Furthermore, NDI is a validated method
for matching deaths in the U.S. to population-based datasets and
for obtaining cause of death [77].
Several studies have examined the relationship between CMV
and mortality [14,49­52]. However, these earlier studies have only
examined the relationship among specific gender and racial/
ethnic subgroups, often among subjects with existing CVD and
primarily compared mortality by CMV antibody titer level (not
CMV serostatus). To the best of our knowledge, our study is the
first to utilize a large, nationally representative U.S. population
aged 25 and older with up to 18.1 years of follow-up (mean of 13.7
years) to examine the relationship between CMV serostatus, CRP
level and all-cause/CVD-related mortality. Therefore, the popu-
lation studied here is much broader in age and on average younger
than the study populations utilized in several earlier studies
examining the impact of CMV infection on mortality. A moderate
increase in risk among a large population with a wide age range in
the US has important implications for potentially shifting the
population burden of diseases [78].
If CMV infection plays a strong role in the etiology of all-cause
and CVD-related mortality in conjunction with high CRP level,
the elimination of CMV infection via the development and
administration of treatments or vaccines [79] and/or targeting the
interaction of infection and CRP levels may reduce mortality rates
in the United States. Colugnati et al. predicted that a vaccination
against CMV would not need to have high efficacy nor wide-
spread coverage to make a substantial impact on CMV
transmission and elimination of CMV from the population has
the potential to greatly reduce the incidence of disease attributable
to CMV infection [6,80]. Therefore, elimination of CMV
infection is a potentially feasible and important avenue of study
for preventing mortality from all-causes and CVD in the United
States.
