Abstract: Little is known about current attitudes towards cousin marriages. Using data
from a rural population in the Mexican state of Oaxaca, the present research examined how
life history was related to attitudes towards cousin marriages in various ethnic groups.
Participants were 205 parents from three ethnic groups. i.e., Mestizos (people of mixed
descent, n = 103), indigenous Mixtecs (n = 65), and Blacks (n = 35). Nearly all men in this
study were farm workers or fishermen. Participants reported more negative than positive
attitudes towards cousin marriage, and women reported more negative attitudes than did
men. The main objection against marrying a cousin was that it is wrong for religious
reasons, whereas the risk of genetic defects was considered relatively unimportant. Cousin
marriage was not considered to contribute to the quality and unity of marriage and the
family. The three ethnic groups did not differ in their attitude towards cousin marriages.
However, a slower life history was related to a more negative attitude towards cousin
marriages, especially among Blacks, less so among Mixtecs, and not at all among Mestizos.
In addition, and independent of the effect of life history, with increasing levels of parental
control over mate choice, the attitude towards cousin marriage was more positive, but
among men the attitude was more negative the more religious they were. The results are
discussed in the context of theorizing on life history theory and the benefits and costs of
cousin marriages.

Introduction
Attitudes towards cousin marriage have varied considerably through human history,
and vary considerably across the world. Often these attitudes have been not particularly
negative, and presently in some places these attitudes are still relatively positive. For

example, according to Kuper (2002), marriage between cousins was permitted in ancient
Israel and was practiced in classic Greece and Rome. Although in the 4th century, Emperor
Theodosius I introduced a ban on marriage between cousins, this practice continued and
among the people attitudes were generally more or less neutral. Much more recently, in the
18th and 19th century in England, cousin marriages became increasingly accepted in
especially the higher classes. Up until the middle of the 19th century, cousin marriage was
permitted in the United States, and in many European countries. However, since the 19th
century attitudes towards cousin marriage in the Western world began to change
drastically. The main reason for this was that the progeny of cousins were believed to be
inflicted with genetic defects and poor breeding, resulted in delays in progress within
society (see e.g., Bittles and Neel, 1994). Currently, thirty-one states in the United States
have laws that prohibit the marriage of cousins or laws that regulate the practice
(Ottenheimer, 1996). And while presently, cousin marriage is legal in all European
countries, attitudes towards this type of union remain generally rather negative (Paul and
Spencer, 2008). Particularly negative attitudes towards cousin marriage also exist in a
number of East Asian countries. For example, in northern India, prior to marriage,
pedigrees are examined up to five generations on the female side and seven on the male in
order to ensure that the bride and groom are not related (Bittles, 2002). In contrast,
currently, attitudes towards cousin marriage tend to be particularly positive in a number of
Islamic countries. About 50% and more of the marriages in countries such as Jordan,
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia occur among cousins (Jaber, Shohot, and Halpern, 1996). Not
much is known about the rate of cousin marriage in African countries outside of the Middle
East, yet it is estimated that about 35-50% of all sub-Saharan African ethnic groups allow
or prefer marriage between cousins (Bittles, 1994).
The historically and cross-culturally often observed accepting attitude towards
cousin marriages clearly suggests that there is as such not an evolved mechanism against
mating with cousins. In fact, we would like to suggest that such marriages may be, or may
have been, adaptive under certain conditions. For instance, cousin marriages may have had
direct biological benefits. Hoben, Buunk, Fincher, Thornhill, and Schaller (2011) showed
that cousin marriages may have arisen as an adaptive response to high pathogen prevalence
and may function to maintain co-adapted gene complexes and local adaptation that defend
against local pathogens. In a similar vein, a study in a French Canadian isolate
demonstrated that women who were biologically related to their partner experienced lower
intrauterine mortality, which in turn resulted in greater fertility (Philippe, 1974; see also
Bittles, Grant, Sullivan, and Hussain, 2002). From the perspective of inclusive fitness,
marrying a cousin may also allow for a smoother transition for a woman to her husband's
family, as the woman may receive more support from the family of her husband because
she is genetically related. In addition, there may be various proximate factors that make
cousin marriages acceptable. For instance, in areas of lower socioeconomic levels, cousin
marriage may help facilitate finding a spouse among the poor because it allows them to
avoid payments that are traditionally associated with marriage such as a dowry or bride
wealth. For the more prosperous, marrying cousins may keep familial wealth together as it
may prevent land and other wealth from distribution outside of the family; thus it may
maintain or increase the status and power of the family in society (e.g., Thornhill, 1991;
Life history and cousin marriage in Mexico

Joseph, 2007). Geographical isolation may also play an important role. In small, isolated
populations, individuals have limited access to mates except from within their group,
increasing the frequency of cousin marriage. Finally, in the Middle East, cousin marriage
seems in part an extension of the wider phenomenon of agnatic (father's lineage) solidarity.
A marriage within the father's line (i.e., father's brother's son) allows male relatives to
remain in close contact with their daughter, sister or niece, thus preventing dishonorable
behavior such as infidelity or premarital sex (Holy, 1989).
Remarkably, there has hardly been any investigation of the actual attitudes and
beliefs regarding cousin marriage in current populations, and of the factors that may
explain these attitudes. In the present research, which was conducted in three ethnic groups
in the state of Oaxaca in Mexico, we examined the attitudes and beliefs towards cousin
marriages in a sample of parents of children in the mating age. We assessed first the beliefs
on the positive and negative consequences of cousin marriages. Next, we investigated the
central assumption in our research that a negative attitude towards cousin marriages is
related to a slow life history strategy. We also examined if parents who favor a high degree
of influence on the mate choice of their children, have a less negative attitude towards
cousin marriages. Finally, we paid attention to sex differences. From the perspective of the
inbreeding hypothesis, we hypothesized that mothers will be more disapproving of
marriage between cousins than fathers will be. For women, the immense investment that is
necessary to gestate a child and the amount of postnatal care is so great that it is more
costly for a female to invest in a child that may suffer from harmful recessive mutations.
For men, the initial investment of time for copulation and contribution of sperm is the
minimum investment necessary (Trivers, 1972). Consequently, the potential biological
harm of mating with a cousin will not be as costly for men, which may make women more
attuned to the potential disadvantages of cousin marriages.
Life history strategy: The "slow" vs. "fast" continuum
The central issue examined in the present research is whether current population
attitudes towards cousin marriage might reflect differences in life-history strategy. In
general, because of limited resources, individuals, in order to successfully reproduce, are
forced to make trade-offs between mating effort, i.e., locating a mate and courting him or
her, and parenting efforts, i.e., gestation, childbirth, and postnatal care of children (e.g.,
Chisholm, 1993; Figueredo, Vasquez, Brumbach, Schneider, Sefcek, et al., 2006). These
trade-offs can be arranged on a continuum that was originally usually described in terms of
the r-K model of reproductive strategies (e.g., Charles and Egan, 2005, Ellis, 1988), but is
now more commonly referred to as the "fast" vs. "slow" continuum of life history strategy.
Individuals at the faster end of the continuum seek to produce many offspring without great
investment in their welfare (i.e., low parental and high mating effort), whereas individuals
at the slower end of the continuum produce fewer offspring and provide greater nurturing
(i.e., high parental and low mating effort). Although both strategies may have been equally
favored by natural selection, they differ in the type of reproductive success they maximize.
Whereas the fast strategy particularly maximizes short-term reproductive success, the slow
life history strategy maximizes long-term reproductive success (e.g., Figueredo et al., 2006;
Kaplan and Gangestad, 2005). That is, having fewer, high quality, offspring may result,
Life history and cousin marriage in Mexico
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(2). 2013. -445-
ultimately, in more descendants in distant future generations than having numerous lesser
quality offspring, whose reproductive success depends more on luck.
In general, as a species, humans tend to follow a "slow" life history strategy
(Bjorklund and Shackelford, 1999; Chisholm, 1993). However ­ as in many other species ­
in order to adapt to changing environmental conditions, individuals in each new generation
also show variation regarding their position on the "fast" vs. "slow" life history continuum
(Figueredo, Vásquez, Brumbach, and Schneider, 2007). That is, some individuals are
"slower" in their life history strategy than others (Chisholm, 1993). Overall, a faster life
history strategy may be the optimal reproductive strategy when the environment is adverse
or unstable (e.g., Chisholm, 1993), and when populations are still growing (e.g., Rushton,
2004). In contrast, when population size stabilizes, and mortality rates are low, slower life
history strategy individuals come to predominate because under steady state conditions,
they are more competitively successful at raising young and organizing the more complex
societies that sustain them (e.g., Buunk, Klavina, and Figueredo, 2009; Figueredo et al.,
2005). There is considerable evidence that stressful experiences in and around their
families of origin ­ such as marital discord, father absence, or traumatic separation from
one's parents ­ lead to a faster life history strategy. This particular strategy is characterized
by investing disproportionately in mating and in early reproduction, whereas a slower life
history is characteristic of individuals who grow up in harmonious homes and homes where
the father is present. Such individuals tend to mature later, to postpone sexual activity and
to display greater investment in the fewer children they produce (e.g., Belsky, Steinberg
and Draper, 1991; Bjorklund and Shackelford, 1999; Ellis, 2004; Pesonen, Räikkönen,
Heinonen, Kajantie, Forsén, and Eriksson, 2008; Tither and Ellis, 2008).
As marrying cousins over generations may involve genetic risks, we predicted that
individuals who adopt a slow life history strategy will have a more negative attitude
towards cousin marriages, whereas individuals with a fast life history strategy cannot afford
to be too selective in their mate choice, and may therefore have a more open attitude cousin
marriage. We do not assume that the effect of slow life history upon a negative attitude
towards cousin marriages reflects the operation of a cousin-specific adaptation; rather it
may be just be one aspect of a more general tendency to be selective in one´s mate choice,
and to be overall more cautious and risk-avoidant ­ typical features of a slow life history.
Parental control of mate choice
Whereas the previous reasoning may apply to individuals whether they are parents
or not, we also examined a factor that may specifically explain attitudes of parents towards
cousin marriages, i.e., the desire of parents to maintain and strengthen the in-group through
controlling the mate choice of their offspring. In most cultures and throughout history,
parents have exerted a strong influence on the mate choice of their offspring (Buunk, Park,
and Duncan, 2010; Murstein, 1974). Apostolou (2007; 2010a) showed that in hunting and
gathering societies as well as in agricultural and postural societies, parental arrangement
was the most frequent type of marriage, especially for females. Even near the end of the
20th century, about half of the marriages of Indian immigrants in the US were arranged
(Menon, 1989). In a study among second-generation South Asian immigrants living in
North America, about a quarter of the participants indicated that their parents would likely
Life history and cousin marriage in Mexico
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(2). 2013. -446-
arrange their marriage (Talbani and Hasanali, 2000). Also within cultural groups and
societies where `love based marriages' are the norm, parents may exert a considerable
degree of control over their children's mate-choice. For example, through controlling the
child's social networks, and through imposing curfews on children that may serve to limit
contact with members of the opposite sex and peers (Das Gupta, 1997; Faulkner and
Schaller, 2007; Perilloux, Fleischman, and Buss, 2008; Wight, Williamson, and Henderson,
2006; Sussman, 1953).
Parents do not randomly control the mate choice of their children. Apostolou
(2010b) found that in preindustrial societies, in addition to a good character, a good family
background and a similar social status were among the most important characteristics
mentioned by parents for a son-in-law and a daughter-in-law. A series of studies conducted
by Buunk, Parks, and Dubbs (2008) showed that in current societies individuals perceive
that their parents would object when they would choose a mate with traits indicating a low
cooperation with the in-group, such as a different ethnicity, a different religion, and coming
from a lower social class. These results were established in culturally diverse samples
including young people from the United States, Kurdistan (Iraq), the Netherlands, Uruguay
and Argentina (Buunk and Castro Solano, 2010; Park, Buunk, and Dubbs, 2009). In
addition, in a study among parents with children between 15 and 25 years of age,
participants perceived characteristics of a son-in-law or a daughter-in-law indicating a lack
of cooperation with the in-group as more unacceptable to themselves than to their offspring
(Dubbs and Buunk, 2010; see also Apostolou, 2007; 2008). Choosing a cousin as a mate
may be the most effective way of ensuring the spouse comes from the in-group. In addition,
relatedness between a person and his cousins is .125, but relatedness between a person and
his nieces and nephews is .25. Thus, parents will tend to want their children to cooperate
more with their cousins than they might naturally want to. We therefore hypothesized that
the attitude towards cousin marriage would be more positive among those parents favoring
more parental control over mate choice.
The Mexican context
The present research was conducted among parents from a rural population in
Oaxaca, one of the poorest states of Mexico, and focused primarily on the indigenous group
of the Mixtecs. Around 30% of the Mexican populations considers themselves to be
American Indian (or predominantly so), and the Mixtecs are an indigenous people who
number somewhere between 250,000 and 500,000. They are the descendants of the people
who constituted one of the major civilizations of Middle America - people that are well
known for their exceptional mastery of jewelry, their codices (phonetic pictures), their
history, their art and their genealogy. The Mixtec region covers most of the current state of
Oaxaca. The Mixtecs are considered to be a very cohesive ethnic group that maintains its
identity despite the high level of migration (see e.g., Joyce, 2010). However, historically,
indigenous cultures such as the Mixtecs have been considered as inferior, (e.g., see
Stutzman, 1981)
To examine whether the pattern we found would be characteristic of the Mixtecs,
and not of the Mexican population as a whole, we included also a sample of Mestizos. In
total, around 60% of the Mexican population perceive themselves to be Mestizos. Whether
Life history and cousin marriage in Mexico
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(2). 2013. -447-
one considers oneself as a Mestizo is to an important extent dependent on political and
cultural factors, and in Mexico one's social identity seems rather fluid, and is not only
dependent on ancestral origins (e.g., Knight, 1990). Following the Mexican revolution, the
Mestizos were promoted as the prototypical Mexicans, when a new ideology of mestizaje
emerged that defined Mexico as essentially a Mestizo nation. To examine if the pattern
found among the Mixtecs was typical for this indigenous population and not for a minority
population as such, we included a quite different ethnic minority group, i.e., Mexican
Blacks. It is not widely known that Mexico has a black community, but it has been
estimated that around 250,000 African slaves were brought to Mexico (Bennett, 2009). In
line with anthropologist Laura Lewis (2000) who studied Mexican Blacks in depth, we
simply refer to Afro-Mexicans as Blacks (negros), a term generally used in Oaxaca to refer
to them. Although most Blacks were absorbed into the Mestizo population, and by the end
of the colonial era Blacks were rarely recognized as a distinct racial or ethnic group
(Villarreal, 2010; Lewis, 2000), over the past years, however, there has been somewhat
more attention for the African roots of the Mexican Blacks. Veracruz and Oaxaca - where
the present research was conducted - have substantial Black populations.
Materials and Methods
Selection of respondents and data collection
In line with the study among Dutch parents on parents' attitudes towards their
children's mate choice (Dubbs and Buunk, 2010), we chose the age range of 15 to 25 for a
couple reasons. By the age of 15, most children have reached puberty, and have begun to
show interest in the opposite sex. In Mexico, the mean age at marriage for women is 22.4
and for men 24.6. Therefore, parents of children in the age range we chose, will generally
be, or recently have been, confronted with potential prospective marital partners; thus for
them whom their child marries will be a salient issue. A collaborator from the region who
was affiliated with the Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Superiores en Antropología
Social (CIESAS) did the data collection. To collect the data, the collaborator first went to
the local officials (comisariado) that represented the people, and explained them what the
nature of the research was, and showed them how to fill out the questionnaire by explaining
each of the questions. The letter of recommendation given by the CIESAS helped
considerably, because it convinced the officials that she just was going to collect data and
not promote any political viewpoint. The officials arranged the day and time at which she
could administer the questionnaire. At these times, people were approached and asked if
they did fit the criteria, and next asked if they were willing to fill out the questionnaire. The
participants were all paid 65 Mexican pesos (around $6) for their participation. For the vast
majority of participants, this was more than their daily income. Although a number of
people felt the money was not enough, in most places, the people were nice and
cooperative, and the sample can be considered quite typical for the local population.
Sample
The sample consisted of 205 respondents from three rural ethnic groups. Half of the
sample (51%, n = 103) were indigenous Mixtecs, 17% (n = 35) were Blacks, and 32% (n =
Life history and cousin marriage in Mexico
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(2). 2013. -448-
65) were Mestizos (for two participants the ethnic background was unknown). A large
majority (94%) was Roman Catholic. There were about equal numbers of males (n= 100),
and females (n= 105), and the sexes were nearly equally distributed over the three ethnic
groups. The mean age in the sample was for women M = 44.79 (SD = 8.09), and for men =
49.85 (SD = 9.91). For the following percentages, because of rounding off and missing
values, the total percentage is sometimes different from 100%. Most women (90%) were
homemakers, 5% had a profession, and 6% indicated not to have a profession. Of the men,
the large majority (74%) were farmers, 10% were fishermen, 16% had a variety of other
professions, and 2% indicated to have no profession. Among women, there was no
difference between the ethnic groups in type of profession, 2 (6, 103) = 9.58, p = .14, but
among men the difference was significant, 2 (6, 100) = 36.06, p = <.01. Among the
Mestizos (85%) as well as Mixtecs (77%), the large majority were farmers, and virtually
nobody was a fisherman (0% and 2%, respectively), with similar numbers of other
professions (15% and 17%, respectively). In contrast, only half of the Blacks were farmers
(50%), and nearly as many were fishermen (45%), with few (5%) involved in other
professions. The incomes were low; 63% had an income of less than 55 pesos a day (less
than +/- $4.50), 31% between 55 and 200 pesos a day (between $4.50 and $16), and 6%
more than 200 pesos a day (> $16). In this respect, the three ethnic groups did not differ,
for women 2 (4, 77) = 2.25, p = .69, for men 2 (8, 97) = 9.77, p = .28. The women had on
average 5.35 (SD = 2.57) children, whereas the men had on average 5.34 children (SD =
2.42). There was no sex difference in the number of children (t (173) = .02, p = .99.
Attitude towards cousin marriage
To assess the attitudes towards cousin marriage, a paper and pencil questionnaire
was created that assessed the beliefs about the positive and negative effects of marrying a
cousin. As is recommended in social psychological research, when assessing the beliefs we
referred to a specific behavior and the attitude was considered more positive, the more
positive effects and the less negative effects, marrying a cousin was assumed to have. The
questionnaire was based on an extensive review of the literature on the assumed advantages
and disadvantages of cousin marriages, as well as on a series of informal interviews with
students and people from the community. The questionnaire consisted of 9 items, 4 of
which expressed a negative, and 5 of which expressed a positive consequence of marrying
a cousin. At the beginning of the questionnaire, participants were presented with the
statement "Marrying a cousin...." Then the 9 items followed. The five positive statements
included 1) means that you marry someone with the same values; 2) enhances the unity in
the family; 3) keeps wealth in the family; 4) makes it easier to get along with your spouse;
5) makes your marriage more stable. The four negative statements included: 1) may lead to
children having a high risk of defects; 2) is wrong for religious reasons; 4) leads to family
conflict; 5) leads to a relationship without passion. Participants were asked to indicate on a
scale from 1 (extremely disagree) to 5 (extremely agree) how much they were in agreement
with the 9 statements. A scale was made with all the negative items (alpha = .65, which
could be enhanced to .69 by deleting the item `Leads to a relationship without passion'),
and a scale was made with all the positive items (alpha = .73). For the total scale of attitude
towards cousin marriage, the negative items were recoded, so that higher scores indicated a
Life history and cousin marriage in Mexico
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(2). 2013. -449-
more positive attitude. The reliability of the total scale was .59 (which could be enhanced
to by deleting the item `leads to a relationship without passion', alpha = .64). The scores
were divided by the number of items.
Life history strategy.
Life history strategy was measured with the Mini-K Life History Strategy Short
Form (Figueredo et al., 2006), a 20-item short form of the Arizona Life History Battery
(ALHB; Figueredo, 2007), which is a battery of cognitive and behavioral indicators of life
history strategy compiled and adapted from various original sources. These self-report
psychometric indicators measure graded individual differences on various complementary
facets of a coherent and coordinated life history strategy, as specified by life history theory,
and converge upon a single multivariate latent construct, the "slow" factor. The component
scales are scored directionally to indicate a "slow" life history strategy on the "fast-slow"
continuum. In a series of psychometric studies, Figueredo and his colleagues (e.g.,
Figueredo et al., 2005; 2006) have shown that a slow life history strategy can be
conceptualized as a higher order construct characterized by a number of reproductive,
parental and sexual behaviors, including good executive functions, positive relationships
with one's parents, positive attachment to an adult partner, low mating effort, low
Machiavellianism, low levels of risk taking, more foresight and planning, and persistence
and self-directedness. The Mini-K correlates 0.85 with the full ALHB (Gladden, Sisco, and
Figueredo, 2008), and uses a 7-point Likert scale, which ranges from -3 (disagree strongly)
to +3 (agree strongly). Alpha reliability in the present sample was .66.
Parental control of mate choice.
To assess the preferred degree of parental control of mate choice, the Parental
Influence on Mate choice (PIM) scale developed by Buunk, Park, and Duncan (2010) was
used. This scale covers the range of possible forms of parental influence on mate choice
(varying from complete autonomy of children to complete control by parents), and was
developed to be sensitive to variations in the degree of parental influence within and
between cultures. For instance, it includes an item that seems to represent the extreme form
of parental influence ­ the practice in which a daughter is treated as a kind of property that
the father is allowed to give to another man. As well as an item that represents the other
extreme ­ the norm that children have the right to select their own partner without any
interference by their parents. All items had the format of a statement to which people could
respond on a 5-point scale from I disagree completely to I agree completely. Seven items
consisted of statements expressing parental influence on mate choice, whereas three items
consisted of statements expressing individual choice. In the present sample, the reliability
was low, alpha = .51. By omitting two items, the reliability could be raised to .60.
However, to keep our results comparable to those of previous research, we decided to use
the same scale. The low alpha reliability is in itself not necessarily a problem, as the items
were explicitly chosen to represent the whole continuum of the scale, and when participants
have a clear preference for one level of control, they do not necessarily have a moderate
preference for a related level of control. We return to this issue in the Discussion. The sum
of the scale was divided by the number of items, M = 2.32, SD = .62.

Results
Attitude towards cousin marriage
Results revealed that, overall, participants did agree most with the negative
statements pertaining marrying a cousin and least with the positive statements (see Table
1). A paired samples t-test was then conducted to determine if there was a significant
difference between the total mean ratings of positive and negative statements. Participants
reported more negative (M = 3.81, SD = 1.00) than positive (M = 2.23, SD = .99), attitudes
towards marrying a cousin, t (197) = 16.37, p = 0.00. In addition, women (M = 4.11, SD =
.77) reported more negative attitudes than did men (M = 3.48, SD = 1.11), t (168.92) =
4.64, p < .001, a difference with a high effect size, Cohen´s d = 0.66. However, men (M =
2.29, SD = 1.00) and women (M = 2.17, SD = .98) did not differ in the positive attitudes
towards marrying a cousin, t (199) = .98, p = .38. GLM analyses with gender and ethnic
group as factors showed no significant main or interaction effects of ethnic group, Fs <
1.37, ps > .25. We also examined if life history differed between men and women, and
between the three ethnic groups. A GLM analysis with gender and ethnic group as factors
showed no significant effects, Fs < 1.37, ps > .26.

A closer look at the participants' ratings of the statements (Table 1) reveals that
participants reported to be in the least agreement with most positive statements; on average,
they disagreed that marrying a cousin would enhance the unity in the family, would keep
wealth in the family, or would make it easier to get along with one's spouse. On average,
participants were neutral with respect to the statement that marrying a cousin would mean
that you would marry someone with the same values. They were on average most, and very
much, in agreement with the statement that marrying a cousin is wrong for religious
reasons, nearly as much with the statement that marrying a cousin leads to family conflict,
and somewhat less with the statement that marrying a cousin would lead to relationship
without passion. It is noteworthy that the notion that a marriage with a cousin would result
in children with a higher risk of mental and physical defects was considered relatively
unimportant.
Given the ­ somewhat unexpected ­ finding that the major objection against cousin
Life history and cousin marriage in Mexico

marriage was the belief that it was wrong for religious reasons, we examined the
association between attitudes towards marrying a cousin and religiosity. It was measured
with one item with five possible answers (i.e., ´I am not at all religious´, ´I am hardly
religious´, ´I am a little religious´, ´I am quite religious´, and ´I am very religious´).
Religiosity was indeed, albeit weakly, associated with a more negative attitude towards
cousin marriages, r = -.18, p = .014.
Effect of life history strategy, gender and ethnic group on attitude toward cousin marriages
To examine the central issue in this research, i.e., how life history strategy is related
to the attitude towards marrying a cousin among mothers and fathers and in the three ethnic
groups, we used the total scale of the attitude towards cousin marriage. We conducted a
univariate GLM analysis with gender and ethnic group as factors, and life history strategy
as continuous variable. All main effects and interactions were included in the model. In the
full model gender had a significant main effect, F (1, 177) = 4.91, p = .028, but there were
no significant interactions involving gender, Fs < 2.02, ps > .15. Therefore, we excluded
these interactions from the final model. In this model there was, in addition to the
significant main effects of gender, F (1, 182) = 10.54, p = .001, and of life history strategy,
F (1, 182) = 21.29, p < .001, a significant interaction between ethnic group and life history
strategy, F (2, 182) = 3.07, p = .049, while the main effect of ethnic group was not
significant, F (2, 182) = 2.15, p = .119. Overall, as predicted, with increasing levels of a
slow life history strategy, the attitude towards marrying a cousin was more negative,  = -
.30, t (189) = 4.24, p <.001. Separate analyses within the three ethnic groups showed that
this was especially true for the Mixtecs,  = -.30, t (95) = 3.14, p = .002, and the Blacks, 
= -.35, t (29) = 4.30, p < .001, but not at all for the Mestizos,  = -.07, t (59) = .57, p = .57.
The lack of an association between life history strategy and attitude towards cousin
marriage among the Mestizos could not be due to a lower variance of these variables in this
group, as there was no significant effect of ethnic group neither on the attitude towards
cousin marriage, F (2, 196) = 1.27, p = .28, nor on life history strategy, F (2, 195) = .72, p
= .49.
In addition, we examined if, when added to the model, parental control over mate
choice had an independent effect. That proved to be the case, F (1, 180) = 21.09, p < .001.
A regression analysis showed that, overall, as predicted, with increasing levels of parental
control, the attitude towards cousin marriage was more positive,  = .24, t (195) = 3.47, p <
.001, whereas the other significant effects remained as strong, or became even stronger.
Given the ­ relatively weak ­ effect of religiosity on negative attitudes towards
cousin marriages, we also examined if the model was upheld when adding religiosity to the
model. It may be noted that there was no effect of ethnic group on religiosity, F (2, 202) =
.92, p = .40, and neither of gender, F (1, 204) = 1.13, p = .13. A GLM analysis showed that
there was a marginally significant effect of religiosity, F (1, 188) = 3.38, p = .07, upon
attitudes towards cousin marriages, whereas the other significant effects remained as
strong, with the exception of the interaction between ethnic group and life history strategy,
that became marginally significant, F (2, 188) = 2.65, p = .07. Although there was no
correlation between religiosity and life history strategy, given these findings, we also
examined if religiosity interacted with ethnic group in their effects on attitudes towards
Life history and cousin marriage in Mexico

cousin marriage. We conducted a GLM analysis with gender and ethnic group as factors,
and religiosity as continuous variable with all main effects and interaction effects included.
This analysis showed nor a main effect of ethnic group, a neither significant interactions
involving ethnic group, Fs < 1.09, ps > .33, but again a strong main effect of gender, F (1,
195) = 7.32, p = .007, a main effect of religiosity, F (1, 195) = 6.44, p = .012, and a
marginally significant interaction between gender and religiosity, F (1, 195) = 3.22, p =
.074. Separate regressions for men and women showed that among women there was not a
significant effect of religiosity,  = -.04, t (102) = .36, p = .72, whereas for men there was a
significant, though moderate, effect  = -.27, t (94) = 2.76, p = .007. Thus, among men, but
not among women, religiosity was associated with a negative attitude towards marrying a
cousin.
Discussion
The present research was conducted among parents in three ethnic groups in the
state of Oaxaca in Mexico. The results demonstrate that participants overall had a negative
attitude to marrying a cousin, and that the three ethnic groups did not differ in this respect.
Unlike what is often assumed, the main objection against marrying a cousin was that it is
wrong for religious reasons, and the risk of genetic defects of children born out of such
marriages was considered relatively unimportant. In line with this, we found that, albeit
only among men, marrying a cousin was viewed more negatively the more religious one
was. Cousin marriage was neither considered to contribute to the quality or unity of
marriage and the family. These findings may suggest that the attitudes towards such
marriages differ from those in Western cultures where especially the risk of genetic defects
of offspring is considered important (Ottenheimer, 1996), as well as from those in Eastern
populations where cousin marriages are considered to preserve the unity of the clan and the
family (cf. Jaber et al., 1996). Furthermore, as predicted, we found a sex difference with
women having overall a considerably more negative attitude towards cousin marriage than
men. This is in line with parental investment theory (Trivers, 1972). Since females invest
the most in conception, birth and postnatal care, investing in a potentially unviable
offspring is extremely costly. Therefore, women may be more concerned that marrying a
cousin leads to children that have a higher risk of being mentally and physically
handicapped. Regardless of whether or not progeny of cousins actually have an increased
risk of being handicapped, if it were believed that this indeed is the case then this would be
more salient for females than for males. Furthermore, the negative view of cousin marriage
may in part be the result of an evolved mechanism to prevent incest (Fessler and Navarrete,
2004; Lieberman et al., 2003, Westermarck, 1921). It seems that within some societies,
including the populations in the present research, this mechanism has extended beyond the
immediate family to include cousins. Cousins are always defined as family, and the notion
of `family' may have become strongly conditioned to the notion `no sex allowed'.
Consequently, it is possible that the mere mention of sexual relationships between family
members could activate the incest avoidance mechanism.
As far as we know, this is the first study providing evidence in an indigenous
population, i.e., the Mixtecs in Mexico, that life history strategy is quite strongly related to
Life history and cousin marriage in Mexico
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(2). 2013. -453-
attitudes towards cousin marriage. Our findings clearly suggest that especially in this
population, more negative attitudes towards cousin marriages do reflect primarily a slow
life history strategy, characterized by typical features such as good executive functions,
positive relationships with one's parents, low mating effort, lower levels of risk taking,
higher levels of foresight and planning, and more persistence and self-directedness.
Individuals with this type of strategy do seem to be relatively less inclined to run the risk of
having offspring with genetic defects because of mating with kin. From a theoretical point
of view this slow life history strategy maximizes long-term reproductive success (e.g.,
Figueredo et al., 2006; Kaplan and Gangestad, 2005) by having fewer, high quality,
offspring rather than having numerous lesser quality offspring, whose reproductive success
depends more on luck. Vice versa, a relatively less negative attitude towards cousin
marriage was found among those with a faster life history. As noted by Belsky et al.
(1991), stressful experiences related to one's family background ­ such as marital discord
or father absence ­ may lead individuals to invest disproportionately in mating as opposed
to parenting. This may make one less selective in the choice of a mate, and less concerned
about the possible negative effects on fitness that mating with a cousin might have.
Psychosexual development involves a self-assessment of one's socio-sexual capabilities
and opportunities, calibrating optimal utilization of physical assets such as size, strength,
health, and attractiveness, as well as psychosocial assets such as intelligence, self-efficacy,
social skills, personality, and socioeconomic status or prospects (e.g., Hunter and
Figueredo, 2000).
While we did not find differences between the ethnic groups in their attitudes
towards cousin marriage, the effect of life history strategy was not only apparent among the
Mixtecs, but also among the Blacks. However, it was not found among the Mestizos,
suggesting that it is more typical of groups that are relatively peripheral in society. Indeed,
although we are reluctant to over-interpret this finding, it is noteworthy that the effect of
life history strategy was not present among the group with the highest status in Mexican
society, for whom apparently the attitude towards cousin marriage is not dependent on
one's preference for a fast or slow life history strategy. While the lower status groups ­ the
Mixtecs and the Blacks ­ did not differ from the Mestizos in terms of life history strategy
and attitudes towards cousin marriage, within both groups there was meaningful variation
in these attitudes, dependent on the extent to which one favored a slow or fast life history.
It must be emphasized that the lack of a relation between life history and attitudes towards
cousin marriage among the Mestizos could not be due to a lower variance of these variables
in this group, as the standard deviations did not differ between the three groups.
An additional finding was that, overall, those who approved of controlling the mate
choice of their offspring had a more positive, or less negative, attitude towards cousin
marriage. This suggests that, as expected, in general, fostering marriages with cousins may
be the ultimate consequence of the preference to control the mate choice of one's offspring
by selecting in-group members as mates for one´s offspring. Indeed, a plethora of studies
shows that in a wide variety of cultures, a major concern of parents is that the mate of their
offspring comes from the same group (e.g., Buunk et al., 2008). A prime example of this
are the various Islamic cultures such as Iran and Saudi Arabia where parents determine to
an important extent whom their offspring marries, and where cousin marriages are very
Life history and cousin marriage in Mexico
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(2). 2013. -454-
common (Jaber et al., 1996). One of the benefits of having one's offspring marry a cousin
is that family and clan alliances are strengthened, and loyalty from one's son and daughter-
in-law better safeguarded.
This study has a number of potential limitations. First, except for life history
strategy and parental control over mate choice, we did not explore other factors that might
affect the attitude towards cousin marriage, including disease avoidance, social isolation
and scarcity of potential mates. Second, we do not know which aspect of life history
strategy is responsible for the effect on the attitudes towards marrying a cousin. For
instance, it may be a result of the fact that those with a slow life history strategy are in
general choosier, or are in general more cautious than those with a fast life history strategy
are. Third, the reliability of the parental control measure was low in this sample, which may
in part be because the items were developed to cover a wide range of behaviors and
attitudes related to parental control of children's mate choice. As these items can be scaled,
this scale does not have the characteristics typical of a Likert scale. Nevertheless, the fact
that we did find such rather consistent and strong effects with this scale, suggests that the
scale is a useful measure. Fourth, we had uneven numbers of participants in the three
groups, and especially Blacks were underrepresented, which may have reduced the power
to find effects. However, it seems that most effects were robust enough to be found even in
the relatively small Black sample. Fifth, while we were primarily interested in the attitudes
of the parents towards the mate choices of their children, and therefore collected data from
parents with children of a marriageable age, the attitudes towards marrying a cousin were
framed in a general way, and not particularly as they applied to the mate choice of their
children. However, it seems very unlikely that parents would not have thought about their
children when filling out the questions, or would have different standards in this respect for
their children than for people in general. Finally, we cannot say with absolute certainty that
the samples were representative for the populations studied, as, for example, a number of
people refused to participate, and it was not possible to draw a random sample from each
group. Nevertheless, the data collection was done very conscientiously, and there is no
reason to assume that there is a substantial bias in the sample. To conclude then, we
collected data from parents in a unique setting, i.e., a rural region with different ethnic
groups that live in close contact with each other. We included in our research in addition to
an indigenous people, i.e., the Mixtecs, also Mestizos ­ who constitute the majority of
Mexican inhabitants ­ as well as the rarely studied Black Mexican people. By examining
how cultural factors may affect the factors affecting attitudes towards cousin marriage, our
research underlines that a resistance against cousin marriage is, dependent on the ethnic
group, related to life history, and overall, to parental control of the mate choice of one's
offspring. This suggests that marrying a cousin may often not just be a matter of
individuals freely selecting a mate, but may to an important extent be affected by the
parents. In general, our research further exemplifies that for a more complete understanding
of human mating, future research must attend more carefully to the role of life history and
parental control of mate choice in affecting attitudes and behaviors concerning cousin
marriages.
