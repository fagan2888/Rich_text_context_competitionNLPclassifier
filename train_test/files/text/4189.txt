Abstract
This contribution describes the way electronic monitoring (EM) is organized
and implemented in the Netherlands. It will become clear that the situation in the
Netherlands is characterized by, in particular, two features. The application of EM is highly
interwoven with the Probation Service and its reintegrative objectives, a characteristic
that dominates the organization and use of EM to a great extent. Paradoxically, EM
is hardly used in the Netherlands as an autonomous (stand-alone) replacement for
short prison sentences. The most straightforward explanation for this situation is that
the Netherlands does not really need EM to replace prison capacity since its prison
population already decreased drastically since 2005. A second explanation is that the
intense involvement of the probation service in the enforcement of electronic monitoring
has as a side-effect that these sanctions are not accepted as punitive sanctions, but fully
framed into the rehabilitative perspective.

Introduction
This contribution describes the manner in which electronic monitoring (EM) is organ-
ized and implemented in the Netherlands. The focus is on the extent to which it is
integrated with the reintegrative aims of the Probation Service and how this can be
explained from a cultural perspective, following the suggestion of Nellis (2014) in his
earlier efforts to understand the use of EM in Europe. To give a better understanding of
the context in which EM is applied, we start with describing the main fluctuations in
the scale and composition of the prison population, since it becomes clear from a com-
parative perspective that the extent to which EM is used, is often related to the need for
prison capacity (Hucklesby et al., 2016). We continue with discussing the political and
societal background in which EM originated and developed. After describing the dif-
ferent modalities of EM and how often they are used, we explain the reintegrative
approach of EM in the Netherlands and how this approach is put into practice. It will
become clear that the situation in the Netherlands is characterized particularly by two
features. The application of EM is highly interwoven with the Probation Service and
its reintegrative objectives, a characteristic that dominates the organization and use of
EM to a great extent. Paradoxically, EM is hardly used in the Netherlands as an autono-
mous (stand-alone) replacement for short prison sentences. In the final section, we will
try to explain these peculiarities in the context of a few dominant characteristics of the
Dutch criminal justice system and the general development of community sentences
and measures.
The research on which this contribution is founded was conducted in the context of an
EU-funded comparative research project involving five jurisdictions, namely: Belgium,
England and Wales, Germany, the Netherlands and Scotland. Because the focus of this
research project is on mapping and exploring the practice of electronic monitoring in the
different jurisdictions, qualitative research methods were most appropriate. At the initial
stage of the fieldwork, a number of observations were carried out at different organiza-
tions involved in the execution of EM, more specifically the Dutch Probation Service,
the Transport and Support Service (since 2014, responsible for the installation, replace-
ment and de-installation of equipment) and Tyco (private organization and the operator
of the monitoring centre of EM in the Netherlands at the time of the research). Between
January and April 2015 observations were carried out on 18 separate days. The objective
of the observations was not only to map and investigate the working processes of EM but
also to identify key practitioners to be approached for an interview. In total, 34 inter-
views were carried out between January and May 2015. Thirty-six respondents were
involved in these interviews; at two occasions two respondents joined the interview. Half
of the respondents were representatives of either the Dutch Probation Service or the
Addiction Probation. However, interviews were also carried out with the other organiza-
tions involved in the operation of EM, namely: the Public Prosecution Service, the judi-
ciary, the Transport and Support Service, the Prison Service and private parties. During
the interviews topic lists were used that had been constructed based on a general inter-
view template and on the observations. The topic lists were revised several times during
the course of the data gathering process to include new relevant topics or subtopics that
were discovered.

Scale and composition of the Dutch prison population
To understand the context in which EM is applied in the Netherlands, it is also important
to have an idea of the size of the prison population and its main fluctuations in recent
years. The highest number of prisoners in 25 years was measured in 2005, with a total
number of 15,206 prisoners (Custodial Institutions Agency, Dienst Justitiële Inrichtingen
[DJI], 2015: 29). By that time, the numbers had quadrupled since 1985. Boone and
Moerings (2007) explain that the main increase took place between 1985 and 2005 and
for six different categories of prisoners. They came to the conclusion that while the cat-
egory of convicted offenders in prison had already started to stabilize, or even fall, from
1996 there had been an impressive increase of the other categories of prisoners: prisoners
on remand, mentally ill offenders in penal-psychiatric institutions (TBS-clinics), irregu-
lar immigrants awaiting deportation (i.e. not for any offence!) and youngsters detained
for child protection reasons (i.e. not for any offence either!). The doubling of prisoners
in remand detention could be explained in particular by the increased detention of small
drug smugglers (`body packers'), `repeat'offenders (mainly drug addicts) and foreigners
without valid papers. They explained the `cell explosion' by the increasing intolerance
and indifference to the problems of these vulnerable groups (Boone and Moerings, 2007:
51­76). This conclusion fits nicely to the main conclusions of Downes and Van
Swaaningen (2007) who focused more on the macro-sociological explanations for the
growing prison rates in the Netherlands in that period. They point, for example, to the
severe budget cuts in welfare-provisions in the 1980s that resulted in a situation in which
social problems were no longer solved by social policy, but were referred to the police
and the criminal justice system (Downes and Van Swaaningen, 2007).
The total number of prisoners has dropped significantly in the period 2005­2014
(DJI, 2015). Between 2005 and 2009 the number of prisoners dropped radically. After
2009, the number stabilized, but in 2012, 2013 and 2014 numbers dropped again.
Compared with 2005, in 2014 the population has dropped with 35% to 9909 prisoners.1
Figure 1 shows the development in the population of prisoners in the period
2010­2014.
With a prison population of 63 per 100,000 prisoners, the Netherlands belongs,
together with Sweden and Finland, to the European countries with the lowest prison
rates, according to the SPACE data of the Council of Europe (corrected by including the
number of persons who are placed under a hospital order, DJI, 2015: 41). What the main
factors for this dramatic fall are still hotly debated in the Netherlands. Van Swaaningen
(2013) and Boone and Van Swaaningen (2013) come to the conclusion that the develop-
ments as explained by Boone and Moerings (2007) are also most influential in explain-
ing the fall of imprisonment rates, but these do not particularly relate to a (reverse of a)
punitive turn. Others suggest that the diminished need for prison capacity is mainly
driven by the reduced result of criminal prosecution of a limited number of serious
offences (Berghuis, 2015) or the considerable reduction of crime rates (Van Dijk, 2010).
For the development of EM, it is important to realise that in the absence of overcrowding
owing to a shortage of prison cells, no economic drive exists to replace imprisonment by
electronic monitoring. On the contrary, the decrease of the Dutch prison population has
dramatic consequences for the Dutch prison staff, often loudly expressed in the media,
Boone et al. 49
which can easily function as an inhibitory factor for the development of further alterna-
tives for prison.
With regard to the central topic of this study, the composition of this small remaining
prison population is something to be aware of as well. Compared with other countries,
the Netherlands still has a remarkably high proportion of pre-trial detainees amongst the
total prison population of 46% in 2013 (DJI, 2015: 31). Another category that is over-
represented in the Dutch prisons are those serving a very short period of time in prison.
As becomes visible in Table 1, 35% of the prisoners that left prison in 2014, stayed in
prison for a period of less than two weeks. This is much more compared with 2010, when
26% of the prisoners stayed in prison for less than two weeks. Sixty percent stayed less
than one month (compared with 48% in 2010), while 89% left prison within six months.
Of the 21,867 unconditional prison sentences that were imposed in 2015, 37.1% had a
duration of less than one month and more than 75% of less than six months. Pre-trial
detainees and prisoners serving short sentences are considered as very suitable for EM,
in the other jurisdictions involved in this study. Why this only partly counts for the
Netherlands will also be explained in this contribution.
The political and societal background of EM in the
Netherlands
The first Dutch media publication on the use of EM in the United States, where it origi-
nated, came in 1987. In this period, the Dutch government was looking for solutions to
ease prison overcrowding and cell shortage. Against this background, it was no surprise
that the possibility of EM was quickly picked up by politicians. In 1988, a working group
was installed to explore the potential of electronic house arrest for providing an alterna-
tive to imprisonment.This working group came to be known as the `Schalken Committee'.

50 European Journal of Probation 9(1)
In its report, the committee suggested that electronic house arrest could be valuable in
terms of rehabilitation, provided that it would be combined with an intensive support
program and `meaningful activities' such as schooling or work. It also stated that elec-
tronic house arrest could have an economizing effect, with the side note that this effect
could be reduced by `net-widening' effects, which means including people in the penal
system that otherwise would have been kept out. The committee further advised giving
judges the exclusive authority for imposing electronic house arrest in order to prevent
arbitrariness. Some other concerns were expressed regarding the intrusiveness of the
modality and how continuous control may be interpreted as a sign of distrust towards the
monitored person. All in all, the committee did not take a clear position but instead
pointed at the importance of a broad debate on the desirability of electronic house arrest.
In response to this report, the Minister of Justice asked in June 1989 for the advice of
many organizations involved in the criminal justice system.According toVan Swaaningen
and Uit Beijerse (2013), only the police was plainly positive as far as EM was applied as
an alternative to an unconditional prison sentence and not as an alternative to remand.
The Probation Service rejected EM altogether, because surveillance with only minimal
human input would be incompatible with the rehabilitative ideal of the Probation Service
(Van Swaaningen and Uit Beijerse, 2013: 173). The debate culminated in a symposium
with 70 experts from several organizations. The majority of the persons present were not
enthusiastic about the implementation of electronic house arrest either in the context of
custody, as an alternative to detention or towards the end of a prison sentence (Van
Gestel, 1998).
Following this symposium, the advice was formulated to refrain from electronic house
arrest while other alternatives were being explored. But between 1985 and 1990 the prison
population doubled and the debate on how to cope with these increasing numbers contin-
ued (Van Swaaningen and Uit Beijerse, 2013: 174). Eventually, in 1994, a newly formed
project group sent a recommendation to the Minister of Justice, in which it advised start-
ing a pilot with electronic house arrest in two forms: in combination with a community
service order and as an alternative to the last phase of a prison sentence in the context of

detention phasing. This plan was approved and in 1995 a two-year experiment started in
the north of the Netherlands. Despite the earlier resistance within the organization, the
Probation Service became the organization responsible for the implementation of EM.
The interviews conducted within the current research make clear that some leading per-
sons within the organization at the time agreed with cooperation, as they were convinced
of the fact that a refusal would have major consequences for the organization. Also, Van
Swaaningen and Uit Beijerse (2013: 175) state that the Probation Service was put under
pressure: if they remained unwilling to start a pilot on EM, the Minister of Justice would
be forced to look for other (i.e. private). From that time, the one experiment with EM fol-
lowed the other (Van Swaaningen & Uit Beijerse, 2013: 173).
In 2003, facing a pressing cell shortage, the modality of electronic detention or `home
detention' was introduced. Electronic detention could be imposed as a means of execut-
ing an unconditional prison sentence of up to 90 days for offenders without a `security
risk' who report themselves to the prison without coercion, so-called self-reporters. As
opposed to the electronic supervision modalities, as described above, the sole objective
of electronic detention was to reduce the shortage of prison cells. It was announced in the
2000 Green Paper `Sanction in perspective' as an alternative for short prison sentences
that could annually save the Dutch taxpayer 115 million guilders, but that did not have a
rehabilitative function. Between 2003 and 2005, 2145 offenders were placed under elec-
tronic detention, of which 1998 did not seriously violate the conditions, according to an
evaluation of the Inspection for Sentencing Implementation. Contrary to the rehabilita-
tive forms of EM, it was not the Dutch Probation Service that was made responsible for
the execution of electronic detention, but the Prison Service of the Department of Justice.
The Inspection for Sentencing Implementation was rather positive about the use of the
electronic detention modality. Despite the fact that the offenders involved usually
belonged to the medium risk category of offenders, actual recidivism was relatively low.
It concluded in its inspection report that electronic detention was an effective alternative
for a short prison sentence. However, the implementation could be improved (Inspectie
voor de sanctietoepassing [Inspection Justice Department], 2007).
Electronic detention was also heavily criticized. The Council for the Administration
of Criminal Justice and the Protection of Juveniles emphasized that home detention
should always be combined with some form of support or assistance and that the prisoner
should have the opportunity to work. Furthermore, the Council stated that the principal
goals of home detention in terms of retribution, deterrence and rehabilitation would have
to be made explicit. This point is also emphasized by Van Swaaningen and Uit Beijerse
(2013), who are concerned that the main rationale behind any form of EM simply tends
to be cost reduction. In June 2010, the Minister of Justice decided to end the practice of
electronic detention awaiting new legislation that would codify EM as a principal pun-
ishment and as a condition to suspend remand (Van Swaaningen and Uit Beijerse, 2013:
181). However, this law never came into force, because the need for home detention as a
substitute for prison declined in the context of a cell surplus and the new State Secretary
of Security and Justice was personally a strong opponent of EM.
In 2013, the Master plan of the Dutch Prison Service for 2013­2018 was published. It
describes the intended changes in the prison system aimed at reducing the expenditures
of the Prison Service with up to 340 million euros in 2018 (DJI, 2013). Electronic
52 European Journal of Probation 9(1)
detention is presented as one of the important instruments for realizing these cuts and a
new Bill on Electronic Detention was proposed in the same period as the Master plan.
Two modalities are mentioned. The first is the `backdoor modality' to be applied after
half of the prison sentence has been served but before conditional release. The second is
the `front-door modality', which is meant to be a substitution for any prison sentence
shorter than six months, unless the possibility for electronic detention is explicitly ruled
out in the verdict. It is estimated that the implementation of electronic detention will
facilitate the reduction of existing prison capacity by 2033 places. For juvenile offenders,
the aim is to increase the imposition of EM as an alternative to remand (DJI, 2013).
The second proposal caused a wave of criticism. In the political arena, the dominant
opinion was that EM was a far too mild alternative for detention. Therefore, EM was not
acceptable as an alternative for short prison sentences. Most Advice Committees that
commented on the Bill were positive about EM as an alternative for short prison sen-
tences, but only if it would become an autonomous sentence that could be imposed by the
judge (courts). More enthusiasm existed for the `back door modality', although several
concerns were expressed in relation to this modality as well, in particular concerning the
replacement of the existing system of detention phasing by electronic detention and the
exclusion of certain groups of prisoners of electronic detention as a result of contraindi-
cations and conditions that would be required (Boone and Van Hattum, 2014; RSJ
[Council for the Administration of Criminal Justice and Youth Protection], 2013).
In September 2014, the electronic detention Bill was rejected by the Upper House. To
the senate, abolishing the existing system of detention phasing was unacceptable and
electronic detention did not provide a workable and legally substantiated alternative.
Legal modalities of EM and numbers
Since its introduction, the use of EM has been remarkably stable until 2013, despite the
fact that it can be used in many modalities since the start. However, since the introduc-
tion of the digital desk (an online tool that enables judges, prosecutors and probation
officers to digitally request probation advice on the desirability of EM in a specific
case) in 2013, there has been a steady increase in the use of EM. Based on the registra-
tions at Dutch probation organizations, a total of 2250 electronic tags were connected in
2015. This represents an increase of 100% compared with 2013, when 1028 connec-
tions were realized.
EM can be applied in several legal modalities and by many different actors. Figure 2
shows that the penitentiary programme that can replace the final phase of a prison sen-
tence is clearly the most commonly used EM modality (746 times in 2015). Participants
of a penitentiary programme are monitored by EM for at least one third of the duration
of the programme. The decision to apply a penitentiary programme is made by the
Probation Service, in close cooperation with the prison service. Much less use is made of
EM in the phase of conditional release. This has probably to do with the fact that only a
minority of the prisoners is conditionally released and special requirements are only
applied scarcely. In cases where conditional release follows a penitentiary programme it
is, moreover, not very logical to make use of EM again, because in that case the prisoner
just has a period of EM behind. EM is increasingly used as a condition for prison leave,
Boone et al. 53
however, although it is not explicitly mentioned as a condition in the law. In the sentenc-
ing phase, EM can be used as a condition of conditional release to monitor a location ban
or a location order, but this modality was only applied 82 times in the period between
January­October 2015. Incidentally, it is also used as such in the context of a conditional
hospital order for offenders who cannot be held responsible for their deeds, but this hap-
pens so incidentally that this modality is not included in Figure 2.2 In the current study it
appeared that judges are still rather reluctant in the Netherlands to apply EM as result of
a lack of knowledge and fear for potential technical failures. This could, on the one hand,
explain the growing use since the introduction of the digital desk (as mentioned above),
and, on the other hand, the underuse of EM in the pre-trial phase, although this use is also
growing in the last two years.
The reintegrative approach of EM
As is described in the introduction, EM was never accepted as an autonomous replace-
ment of a prison sentence without supervision (stand-alone measure) in the Netherlands.
This is a striking difference with, for example, the community service order. This sen-
tence was codified relatively short after its introduction in the Dutch sentencing system
as an autonomous sentence that could only be imposed by an independent judge, mainly
because it was considered to be a too severe sentence to apply with less legal guarantees
(Boone, 2010, 2016). EM is always applied as an additional tool to control the conditions
of a conditional sentence (in particular a location ban or a location order) to enhance the
credibility of such sanctions and enlarge their effectiveness. This character is reflected in
the answers our respondents gave to the question regarding what they considered to be
the most important objectives of EM. Rather unanimously, respondents with different
backgrounds mentioned the reintegrative objectives of EM before the more retributive or
preventive aims. One of the main objectives of EM is considered to be improving the
monitoring of the behaviour of participants. Monitoring is needed to make sure that pro-
bationers abide by the conditions that are attached to their supervision. Probation officers
indicate that EM provides an easier and more effective means to monitor whether people

54 European Journal of Probation 9(1)
obey the rules that are set. More specifically, the EM technique allows them to see if
someone is at home during their curfew hours (in case of a location order) and/or if they
stay away from exclusion zones (in case of a location ban).
For people who participate in a penitentiary programme, monitoring is found to be of
particular importance. Officially, prisoners who are in such a programme fall under the
responsibility of the Prison Service, because they are still in detention, although not in
the sense of staying inside a penitentiary institution. Therefore, the conditions attached
to the programme, such as a curfew, need to be monitored appropriately according to our
respondents. One of the respondents articulates this as follows:
I think it is good to monitor. I also think that it is good to give someone gradually more freedom,
because it is quite something when you come from a closed setting and you go outside. So in
that sense it serves as a safeguard . . . I believe it has added value because you can expect that
when the tag is removed no participant will think at 10.30pm, `I should be in a hurry now to be
at home at 11pm'. And the later at night, the bigger the temptations. Well, the intention is to
bring someone back into society. (Prison service 1 ­ Penitentiary facility administration
manager)
In the pre-trial phase, an important objective of releasing suspects with EM according to
several respondents is that they can continue their work or education. The same counts
when suspects are caring for children or parents. With EM, they can be released and
continue their normal daily life, but their whereabouts can still be monitored. Judges also
indicate that EM serves the purpose of enforcing the conditions that are attached to a
conditional sentence or a conditional release from prison. EM is not perceived as a
behavioural condition in itself, but it can enforce other conditions attached to a sentence
or conditional release (criminal court judge 1). Summarizing, the idea is that by means
of EM re-offending can be prevented. This is achieved directly by monitoring the behav-
iour of participants and indirectly by giving participants the chance to continue their
work or education, while on EM. A structured lifestyle and a paid job are seen by many
professionals as protective factors against crime.
The second main objective of EM is realizing behavioural change by providing sup-
port. EM is part of the supervision that the Probation Service provides and it supports
the probation officer in steering the probationer towards changing their behaviour.
First, EM can help the probation officer to set boundaries, to talk about the proba-
tioner's behaviour and to make them aware of the fact they are being monitored.
Second, the emphasis can be shifted towards the own responsibility of the probationer
and freedoms can be gradually increased. According to probation officers, EM has a
strong structuring effect on the life of participants, which was also observed in earlier
research (Berends et al., 2008).
A curfew, monitored by EM, means that someone is not allowed to be out on the street
at night anymore. Therefore, the day and night rhythm of the participant normalizes and
the temptations provided by criminal friends are minimalized. Probation officers see EM
as a tool that helps them to change the lifestyle and the behaviour of the participant. The
final end result should be a reduction in re-offending. The following quote illustrates the
vision of probation officers on the role of EM in their work:
Boone et al. 55
. . . it can offer conditions that you'll need to realize behavioural changes that last when the tag
is removed. But, I believe, it cannot be a goal in itself, without support, because then you'll
achieve nothing. When the tag is removed you lose that person, because mentally you have
changed nothing. (Probation officer 5)
Changing the lifestyle of the participant is also achieved by providing an incentive to
pick up work or education, because when the participant does not have any daytime
activities, while on curfew, they are only allowed to leave their home for a couple of
hours per day. Starting a job or education means that the participant can go outside of the
house during the day.
I: So, you believe that EM can contribute to structuring the life of a person?
PO: Yes.
I: How does that work? Can you tell a little bit more about that?
PO: Yes, because in the first place they will be motivated to start school or a job, because
otherwise they will be at home all day. Well, they don't really like that. So, then they will start
school or a job. Because then they will have more free time, with the tag. From there, they will
be on the streets with friends less often, they will have to get up early in the morning. Often you
call them, around 2pm and they are still lying in bed. But then they will have to get up early and
go to school and in the end they go to bed early at night because they are tired. And that helps
a lot. Because they will not be on the streets at night. So, it can contribute to structure and day-
and-night rhythm. (Probation officer 11)
How the reintegrative approach is put into practice
The dominance of the reintegrative approach is visible in the way in which EM is organ-
ized. Below, we describe five characteristics of the implementation of EM in the
Netherlands that make more concrete how the reintegrative approach is put into practice.
Involvement of probation officers
As stressed before, the Probation Service plays a major role in the implementation of EM
in the Netherlands. In case EM is considered as a condition to a penitentiary programme,
an advice of the Probation Service is always taken into account. Also, when EM is opted
to be applied in another modality, an advisor of the Probation Service advises on the
appropriateness of EM following a request of the probation officer, prosecutor or judge.
After a positive decision, the case is handed to a probation officer who is responsible for
carrying out the feasibility study (see below). When the outcome is positive and the pro-
bationer is actually tagged, a probation officer is always present during the installation of
the equipment. Next, the probation officer takes all the decisions with respect to the
granting and withdrawing of liberties. Moreover, in contrast with other jurisdictions
involved in this study, the response to violations is related more to the person than to the
type of violation. The circumstances of individuals are taken into consideration during
56 European Journal of Probation 9(1)
the initial response of probation officers to violations rather than after formal breach
proceedings have started (Hucklesby et al., 2016: 27).
Individualized decision-making
No categories of offenders are officially excluded from EM. The criteria for qualifying
for EM are identical to the criteria for qualifying for a certain modality in which EM can
be applied. EM is also applied to juveniles, but much less often than to adults. In the
interviews, however, certain contra-indications were mentioned regarding the applica-
tion of EM. EM is deemed to be inappropriate for people who are seriously addicted or
who are suffering from serious psychiatric disorders. With regard to the first group of
people, it was explained that when people only live to score drugs it is very difficult for
them to comply with the rules that are attached to EM, such as being at home on time.
Also, the context of an offence can be a contra-indication. When the (alleged) offence
has been committed from the house of the person, for example in case of cyber-crime or
drug-dealing, EM is often not recommended by the prosecution service, because it could
easily enhance the risk on recidivism. This is also the case when the situation at home is
not stable or safe, for example when domestic violence occurred or too many people stay
at the place.
A characteristic of the practice of EM in the Netherlands is that it is decided on an
individual level whether EM is feasible or desirable under certain circumstances. The
feasibility study plays an important role in this respect. A feasibility study is carried out
by means of a home visit to the place where the potential participant wishes to live. It is
carried out by the probation officer who most likely will carry out the supervision of the
participant in the later stages of the process. The results of this investigation are reported
in written form to the advisor, who incorporates it in his final social enquiry report. A
home visit takes approximately thirty minutes and in general it is conducted by the pro-
bation officer alone. Next to technical feasibility, the social circumstances of the place
are taken into account as well. It is important that the home owner is able to pay the rent
or mortgage and the electricity bills. Therefore, it is important that no outstanding fines
or other debts exist, especially not with the energy company because of the risk of losing
the house. It is important that the participant will have his own bedroom and place to
sleep, because he might have to be at home during a considerable time of the day. The
probation officer informs the cohabitants about the implications of EM and needs the
consent of the principal occupant of the house. Although the feasibility study almost
never results in a negative advice, it is considered to be an important part of the decision-
making process, according to our respondents deriving from the probation service.
Added value
The general approach is that EM should only be added to a supervision order in case this
enhances the possibility that the offender will comply with the rules. In case a supervi-
sion order can also be successfully implemented without supervision, EM could be omit-
ted. EM can have added value because it provides the probation officer with information
they can use in his or her conversation with the person involved.
Boone et al. 57
Every Monday, the national coordinator sends a weekly report of each participant to
the supervising probation officer. This report consists of a listing of all the notifications
in a given week. The probation officers can use the weekly reports in their meetings with
participants. They can, for example, discuss issues such as regularly coming home a
couple of minutes too late or problems with charging the tag. Probation officers can also
consult the national coordinators in case they would like to have more information gener-
ated by the tag. They can, for example, ask for GPS-trails of a given evening, as is
explained by one of the coordinators:
And sometimes probation officers ask us for information. `I'd like to know what he is doing on
Saturday night, because the local police officer says he is hanging around with his old group.
Can you check for me where he was the last two Saturday nights between this and that time?'
Well, we can do that. The probation service can check these data and talk about it with the
client. Exchanging information with a third party is something we don't do just like that, but a
probation officer can receive every trail, if he wishes so. And they make use of that. (Addiction
Probation Service 1 ­ national coordinator).
Daily activities
A well-known metaphor in the Dutch debate on EM is the `beer on the couch', which was
used by the former State Secretary to express his concern that electronic monitored people
would stay at home all day, doing nothing else but drinking beer. This critical approach
towards EM as a stand-alone measure without a reintegrative programme, is widely
shared by our respondents, in particular those who are part of the Probation Service. In
case of a penitentiary programme (the most used modality), EM should be combined with
daily activities of at least 26 hours per week, this can be work, education or a combination
of both. These strict requirements do not count for the other modalities, but when a loca-
tion ban is imposed and the probationer does not have daily activities, he or she has to stay
at home for 22 hours a day. According to our respondents, these severe restrictions stimu-
late people to put more effort in finding a job or other activities. In general, meaningful
daily activities are considered to be of utmost importance according to an overwhelming
majority of our respondents. Structured, daily activities give satisfaction and positive
social contacts and have as a positive side effect that people have less energy to go on the
streets at night. Another valuable aspect according to some of our respondents is that peo-
ple have something to lose, such as a job. Probation officers help probationers to find
meaningful activities and to continue with it. Besides daily activities, regular contacts
exist between the supervisor and the person under supervision. The number of fixed con-
tact moments depends on the supervision level (see Table 2). The supervision level reflects
the risk score given to a probationer. At supervision level 3 they have two fixed contact
moments a week, at supervision level 2 one, and at supervision level 1, one talk every two
weeks. Next to the compulsory meetings, supervisors may join participants to appoint-
ments at the municipality, an employer or a treatment facility.
Phasing
As said, EM is mostly applied at the `back door' of the sentencing process as an execu-
tion modality of the prison sentence (penitentiary programme) or during the early release
58 European Journal of Probation 9(1)
phase. The dominance of the reintegrative approach is visible in the way EM is imple-
mented. In the back door stage, increasing the hours of free time is standard practice.
When a participant starts in level 3 the period of the programme is divided in three parts,
and when the participant behaves well and sticks to the rules they are promoted to the
next level after one-third of the programme (see Table 2). Probation officers indicate that
it is desirable that participants have functioned in level 1 before EM is ended, because
otherwise the gap between the number of free hours in level 2 and total freedom is too
large, although it is possible that the curfew remains in place without being electronically
monitored. The probation officers take decisions with regard to increasing freedoms by
themselves and this is not discussed with a mandator. To take these decisions, probation
officers discuss cases with colleagues. They indicate that they regularly have meetings in
which current cases are discussed and they find it important to always consult a col-
league when they are not sure about which decision they should take in a case. The fol-
lowing quote illustrates this practice:
We can promote or degrade someone. So someone goes from level 3 to level 2. It has to be
agreed by the team, team wide, I cannot decide that on my own, but it is decided during a case
meeting. When we promote someone to level two, different freedoms are applied. Then you get
more hours. But it can also be the case that someone in a penitentiary programme has to remain
tagged, but then he enters his second one-third or last one-third and we can phase depending on
how someone is doing in the programme. It could be that we decide a participant is given 17
hours of freedom seven days a week for the last period. But he stays tagged. We don't discuss
that with the mandator. That is the framework in which we can decide ourselves. (Probation
officer 6).
These freedoms concern the number of curfew hours and do not apply to a location
ban. Location bans are generally not changed structurally during the period on probation.
Incidental changes can be made with regard to both the curfew hours and the location
ban. The contribution to rehabilitation is taken into consideration here. For example,
there may be a family event.
Discussion: Contextualizing the Dutch approach
This contribution demonstrates that the main objective of EM in the Netherlands is to
enhance the rehabilitative potential of other non-custodial sanctions. The enhance-
ment applies, in particular, to the penitentiary programmes that are applied in the final
stage of a prison sentence and conditions added to conditional custodial sanctions in
all stages of the criminal justice process. This characteristic can be explained by the
early adoption of EM by some leading figures in the Probation Service. This

integrated or `goal oriented approach', as it is named by the Probation Service itself,
is visible in all aspects of its application: selection of candidates, the emphasis on
meaningful daily activities, the gradual system of awarding more free time and the
response to violations (more related to the person than to the type of violation). If EM
had become an instrument that was mainly in hands of the Justice Department, it
could easily have formed into another shape. In contrast with the views of probation
officers, our respondents of the Justice Department attached much more value to the
potential of EM to protect victims or society in general. More specifically, they highly
considered the potential of EM to signal to victims and society in general that their
interests are taken into account when granting liberties to suspects or offenders. As a
matter of fact: respondents of the Justice Department attached much less value to the
idea that EM should only be applied in case it has `added value' and that it should be
omitted in case a supervision order could also be successfully implemented without
EM. The application of EM has already changed in recent years as a consequence of
the increasing approval of the point of view of the Justice Department. EM is, for
example, applied automatically when liberties are granted, in the form of leave, a
penitentiary programme or conditional release, to suspects or offenders of high impact
crimes. As a consequence, EM is used increasingly as a condition of leave ­ as an
instrument of the prison service ­ without any interference of the Probation Service.
Because of these developments, it remains highly uncertain which direction the appli-
cation of EM will take in the coming years.
An important question that arises in the context of the Dutch approach is what can
explain the stubborn refusal of EM as an autonomous alternative for short prison sen-
tences? With a prison population of which 60% stays in prison for less than one month
(see Table 1), it seems that EM can be extremely useful in this modality. EM as a stand-
alone sentencing option for less serious offences is common practice in most other coun-
tries involved in the comparative study this contribution is part of. Also, Sweden, a
country that has a comparable rehabilitative approach towards EM (although embedded
in a society in which social-democratic values still seem to be much more alive), has
used EM deliberately to reduce short prison sentence (Nellis and Bungerfeldt, 2013),
while a similar proposal has been firmly rejected again in the Netherlands in 2013. We
can think of two major reasons. The most straight forward explanation is that the
Netherlands does not really need EM to replace prison capacity since its prison popula-
tion decreased already drastically since 2005 with unemployment of prison staff as a
result. The comparative analysis conducted as part of this study (Hucklesby et al., 2016)
shows that the size of the prison population is strongly connected to the use of EM. It is
true for the Netherlands that the only period in which EM was used as a stand-alone
alternative for short prison sentences, was between 2003 and 2005 when there was an
urgent need for prison cells. Even then, this modality was strongly rejected, however, by
different parts of society and therefore ended despite its relative success. A second expla-
nation is that EM is accepted in the Netherlands only as a tool to improve resocialization
of offenders, predominantly in the final stage of their prison sentence, but not as a puni-
tive sentence in itself. This explanation is in line with the development of other forms of
community sanctions (e.g. community service orders) and can probably be explained by
the intense involvement of the Probation Service in the execution and enforcement of
community sentences. This has as a side-effect that these sentences were fully framed
60 European Journal of Probation 9(1)
into the rehabilitative perspective (Boone, 2016). Therefore, EM is seen by the general
public and politicians as a soft and non-punitive alternative to imprisonment. It is not
perceived as `a real sentence'with enough punitive elements to replace prison sentences.
EM is accepted as a useful extra tool for the Probation Service to monitor probationers
during the resocialization process, but not as an autonomous sanction, with punitive as
well as rehabilitative characteristics.

Notes
1. This number includes prisoners who are detained within a penitentiary institution, but also
prisoners who are placed in special health care institutions that are used for those who are
particularly vulnerable and persons who follow a penitentiary program outside prison (DJI,
2015: 29).
2. This also counts for some other very scarcely used modalities, posted in the category `other'.
3. In case a participant does not have any structured daily activities, they are only given two free
hours per day.
