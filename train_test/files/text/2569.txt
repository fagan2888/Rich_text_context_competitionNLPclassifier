Abstract
Background: In the general population, the association between uninsurance and mortality is well established. We
sought to evaluate the association of health insurance status with mortality among working-age participants with
albuminuria in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988­1994 (NHANES III).
Methods: We used data from non-elderly adult participants (18­64) of NHANES III (1988­1994), a nationally
representative study of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population, who provided information on insurance and
who had albuminuria, defined as a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR]  30 mg/g and their subsequent
mortality to December 31, 2006. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine associations between
insurance status and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD while adjusting in a
stepwise fashion for sociodemographic factors, co-morbidities, and co-morbidity severity/control covariates.
Results: In our sample of individuals with albuminuria (n = 903), mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
was 101.6 ml/min/1.73 m2 with 4.7 % with an eGFR <60. Approximately 15 % of the sample was uninsured, 18 %
had public insurance and 67 % had private insurance. Compared to individuals with private insurance, those
with public insurance or no insurance were significantly more likely to be a racial or ethnic minority, to have
income <200 % below the federal poverty level, to have less than high school education; and they were less likely
to be married and to report good or excellent health, all p < 0.05. Being uninsured or having public insurance was
associated with increased all-cause mortality in the fully adjusted model (HR 2.97 and 3.65, respectively, p < 0.05).
There was no significant relationship between insurance status and cardiovascular mortality.
Conclusions: In a nationally representative sample of individuals with albuminuria, uninsurance and public
insurance were associated with increased mortality compared to the private insurance even after controlling for
sociodemographic, health status, and health care variables. Improving access to care and the quality of care
received may potentially reduce mortality in individuals with evidence of early CKD.

Background
It is estimated that about 13 % of US working-age adults
are currently uninsured [1]. The Affordable Care Act
has the potential to continue to reduce the number of
uninsured individuals in the US [2]. Health insurance is
an important first step to health care access for these in-
dividuals. Uninsured adults receive less appropriate care
and have worse outcomes compared to those with insur-
ance [3­5]. More than 10 million adults in the US have
albuminuria with preserved estimated glomerular filtra-
tion rate. Albuminuria is a well-established risk factor
for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, cardiovas-
cular events, and death [6­12]. Although lack of health
insurance is known to be an important predictor of ad-
verse outcomes among individuals with various medical
conditions [3­5], its impact on mortality in adults with
albuminuria has not been thoroughly evaluated. Prior
work has shown that individuals who belong to racial

and ethnic minority groups and those of lower socioeco-
nomic status (SES) have a greater risk of albuminuria, and
have greater health consequence associated with albumin-
uria [12­14]. The objective of this study is to evaluate the
association of insurance status with all-cause and cardio-
vascular mortality among working-age adults with albu-
minuria in the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, 1988­1994 (NHANES III).
Methods
Study population
NHANES III, conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS) between 1988 and 1994, is a
nationally representative study based on a stratified,
clustered, multistage probability sample survey of the
civilian, noninstitutionalized population in the US. All
participants provided informed consent. Participants
underwent a home interview followed by an extensive
physical examination and blood and urine sampling at a
mobile examination center. Blood and urine samples
and blood pressure were obtained during the physical
examination. Self-reported information on sociodemo-
graphic characteristics and presence of medical condi-
tions was collected during the home interview [15]. The
survey protocol was approved by the NCHS institutional
review board. Participants 65 years of age and older were
excluded due to their low rates of uninsurance due to
Medicare eligibility. Our sample included all NHANES
III respondents aged 18­64 years with albuminuria who
provided information on insurance.
Of the 33,356 NHANES III participants examined, we
excluded 19,313 individuals who were pregnant, older
than 65 or younger than 18 years. Of the 14,043, men
and non-pregnant women between 18 and 65 years, we
excluded 2804 individuals due to missing information on
UACR, serum creatinine, or insurance status. We ex-
cluded 10,298 individuals without albuminuria and seven
with eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2. Our final sample in-
cluded 934 individuals with UACR  30 mg/g (Fig. 1).
Compared to individuals in the final cohort, individuals
who were excluded due to missing UACR were more
likely to be older (50.3 vs 41.9 years, p < .001), and have
an income <200 % federal poverty level (FPL) (51.2 vs
41.54 %, p = 0.03). Compared to individuals in the final
cohort, individuals who were excluded because of miss-
ing insurance were more likely to be younger (35.2 vs
41.9 years, p < .001), be male (49.7 vs 37.4 %, p < .001),
have < high school education (83.5 vs 73.8 %, p = 0.003),
and to have an income <200 % FPL (73.3 vs 41.5 %,
p < .001) (Data not shown).
Definition of variables
Albuminuria was defined as a urine albumin-to-
creatinine ratio [UACR]  30 mg/g. Estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the 2012
CKD Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine equation
[16]. We used the formula for correction of serum
creatinine recommended in the NHANES III Data
File Documentation [17]. Hypertension was defined as
a BP >140 mmHg/>90 mmHg or the use of antihy-
pertensive medications. Diabetes was defined as a history
of diabetes, use of insulin or other medication to treat dia-
betes, a fasting blood glucose level 126 mg/dl, or a ran-
dom blood glucose level 200 mg/dl. Hypercholesterolemia
was a total cholesterol concentration 200 mg/dL. History
of cardiovascular disease was defined by an affirma-
tive answer to at least one of the following: history of
heart attack, congestive heart failure, or stroke. Insur-
ance status was obtained by patient self-report. At the
time of interview patients were asked if they were
covered by Medicare, Medicaid, CHAMPUS/VA/mili-
tary insurance or private insurance in the last month.
The answers were categorized as uninsured (none of
the above), public insurance (Medicare or Medicaid),
or private (all other) insurance.
Outcome ascertainment
Mortality follow-up
Vital status was established using the NHANES III Linked
Mortality File which provided follow-up for mortality
through December 31, 2006. Probabilistic matching was

used to link NHANES III participants with the National
Death Index (NDI) to ascertain vital status. Matching was
based on 12 identifiers for each participant (e.g., Social Se-
curity number, sex, and date of birth). Participants who
were not matched with any death records were considered
to be alive through the follow-up period. Cause of death
was assigned by the NCHS based on the International
Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision [18]. For this
study, cardiovascular mortality was defined as death due
to diseases of the heart, essential hypertension and hyper-
tensive kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, athero-
sclerosis, and other diseases/disorders of the circulatory
system (codes 100­199) [19].
Statistical analysis
NCHS recommendations were followed to account for
stratification and clustering in the survey design, as well
as oversampling of ethnic minorities and elderly persons
[17]. Continuous variables were expressed as weighted
means (standard error) and categorical variables as
weighted percentage. Baseline characteristics were com-
pared across insurance status using analysis of variance
for continuous variables and chi square for categorical
variables.
Weighted age-adjusted all-cause and cardiovascular
mortality rates were calculated by 1000 person/year. Cox
proportional hazards models were used to determine the
association of insurance status with all-cause and cardio-
vascular mortality in patients with albuminuria adjusting
for important covariates in a hierarchical fashion: 1)
Model 1: sociodemographic factors (age, gender, race/eth-
nicity, income, education, and marital status); 2) Model
2: Variables included in Model 1 plus co-morbidities
(diabetes mellitus status, cardiovascular disease, smok-
ing, body mass index, and cancer); 3) Model 3: Variables
included in Model 2 plus co-morbidity severity (eGFR,
systolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and hemoglobin
A1C); and 4) Model 4: Variables included in Model 3 plus
co-morbidity management (use of statin, use of ACEi). In
addition, we evaluated for the presence of interaction be-
tween insurance status and age, gender, and race/ethnicity
on all-cause mortality by adding interaction terms in
the fully adjusted models. The proportional hazards
assumption of the Cox models was examined using
Schoenfeld residuals.
Results
In our study population (Table 1), the mean age at the
time of the interview was 42 years, 63 % of participants
were women, 67 % were non-Hispanic White, 16 % were
non-Hispanic Black, 6 % were Mexican American and
11 % were of other racial/ethnic background. In
addition, approximately 37 % had income less than
200 % FPL, 74 % had less than high school education
and 64 % were married. In this sample of NHANES par-
ticipants, 40 % of participants reported excellent or very
good health, 36 % had hypertension, 24 % had diabetes,
44 % had hypercholesterolemia, and 6 % reported car-
diovascular disease. The mean eGFR was 102 mL/min/
1.73 m2 and median UACR was 71 mg/g. Overall, 4.7 %
of the participants had eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and
11.5 % had UACR  300 mg/g.
The weighted prevalence of uninsured, public insur-
ance and private insurance was 15, 18 and 67 %, respect-
ively. Compared to individuals with private insurance,
those with public insurance or no insurance were signifi-
cantly more likely to belong to a racial/ethnic minority
group, to have income <200 % FPL, and to have less
than high school education (p < 0.05 for each compari-
son). Uninsured individuals were younger and less likely
to report a usual source of care than their insured coun-
terparts (private or public), all p < 0.05. Individuals with
public insurance differed from their privately (and non-
insured counterparts) in that they were more likely to be
non-Hispanic Black, to report fair/poor health, to be
previously married, and to have hypertension, diabetes
or cardiovascular disease, all p < 0.05. There were no sig-
nificant differences in mean eGFR, UACR, statin use, or
ACE-i use by insurance status.
All-cause and cardiovascular mortality by insurance status
and access to care for individuals with albuminuria
The age-adjusted all-cause mortality rate for individuals
with albuminuria was 13.5/1000 person-year (Table 2).
Crude rates of all-cause mortality were higher in in the
uninsured and individuals with public insurance than in
those with private insurance (17.8 and 24.1 vs 10.4, re-
spectively). A similar pattern was observed with cardio-
vascular mortality rates.
In fully adjusted models, compared to individuals with
private insurance, being uninsured was associated with
increased risk for all-cause mortality (HR 2.97, 95 % CI
1.29­6.85). Compared to individuals with private insur-
ance, having public insurance was also associated with
increased mortality (HR 3.65, 95 % CI 1.74­7.67)
(Table 3). There was a suggestion of effect modification
by eGFR; however, due to low proportion of individuals
with eGFR < 60 stratified analyses could not be done.
We found no interaction between insurance status and
race/ethnicity, gender, or age.
The age-adjusted cardiovascular mortality rate for in-
dividuals with albuminuria was 5.16/1000 person-year
(Table 2). In fully adjusted models, the cardiovascular
mortality risk was similar between individuals with pri-
vate insurance vs uninsured vs public insurance. We
found no significant interaction between insurance sta-
tus and age, gender, race, or eGFR on cardiovascular
mortality.

Discussion
In this nationally representative sample of individuals
with albuminuria and preserved eGFR, we found that
both uninsurance and public insurance were associated
with a significantly higher risk for mortality compared to
private insurance. Uninsured individuals with albumin-
uria had nearly a three-fold higher risk for all-cause
mortality than their privately insured counterparts after
controlling for socioeconomic and clinical characteristic.
Similar to our findings, the Kidney Early Evaluation Pro-
gram (KEEP), a community-based health screening pro-
gram, found an increased risk for death in uninsured
participants with CKD stages 1­2 as compared to those
with private insurance [20]. Our study provides corrob-
orative evidence in a sample representative of the US
population.
We found that in a working age, US population with
albuminuria, 15 % were uninsured, 18 % had public in-
surance, and 67 % had private insurance. Uninsurance
was higher than a previous examination of uninsured
adults with CKD because we looked only at individuals
younger than 65 whom comprise over 90 % of the unin-
sured with CKD [21]. Our uninsurance rate was closer
to Wilper et al. who also used NHANES to examine
uninsurance in working age adults [5, 22].
In the general population, the association of uninsur-
ance with increased risk for mortality is well established
[5, 23, 24]. However, the relationship between insurance
status and outcomes has not been as well studied in the
CKD population. In a cross-sectional analysis of data
from NHANES, uninsured individuals with CKD were
less likely to have controlled hypertension or to receive
an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) than
those with insurance [21, 25]. At the time of our study,
rates of both ACEi and statin use were low in the gen-
eral population [26, 27]. Although we did not find a sig-
nificant difference in rates of ACEi use across insurance
categories, adding ACEi and statin to our final model in-
creased both the magnitude and significance of the asso-
ciation between uninsurance and mortality. These
findings suggest that ACE/statin are important media-
tors of the association or that they are potentially in the
causal pathway.
Publicly insured individuals with albuminuria also had
a significantly higher all-cause mortality rate than their
privately insured counterparts. This finding was true
both in the crude model and after adjusting for socio-
economic and clinical characteristics. For most working-
age adults, eligibility for public insurance is dependent
on income and poor health [28]. In a national survey
data study, Sorlie et al. also reported increased mortal-
ity in individuals with public insurance as compared to
those with employer provided insurance [29]. Sorlie
also found that in certain groups, public insurance was
associated with increased mortality compared to unin-
surance [29].
Our findings that health insurance is an important
predictor of mortality in individuals with kidney disease,
many of whom had early signs of kidney disease, has im-
portant implications in the current climate of healthcare
reform. The number of uninsured in the US has de-
creased due both to the economic recovery and imple-
mentation of Affordable Care Act. The uninsurance rate
for working age adults, 18­64 years old, was estimated
to be 12.4 % in late 2014 [1]. Due to targeted policies,
poor working adults saw the largest gains in insurance
coverage, particularly in Medicaid expansion states [1].
However, the uninsured have gained coverage through a
combination of expansion of employer-based coverage,
health insurance exchanges, extended parental coverage,
and Medicaid expansion [30]. More individuals may
potentially benefit given the current eligibility, and re-
quirement, for nearly all working age adults to obtain in-
surance. In addition, the association of public insurance
with increased mortality will likely be reduced as eligibil-
ity is based on income rather than health status.

We found a less convincing relationship between in-
surance status and cardiovascular mortality. The unin-
sured did not have a significantly different CV mortality
than their privately insured counterparts. This finding
seems surprising given the importance of medical care
in managing cardiovascular risk factors and intervening
on cardiovascular events. One possible explanation is
that uninsured individuals with CKD and CV disease
may remain uninsured for less time than their healthier
counterparts. Due either to the number or severity of
CV risk factors, they are more likely to meet criteria for
public insurance. One final explanation is that since
everyone regardless of insurance status is eligible for
medical care during a cardiovascular emergency, the ef-
fect of insurance status on access to life-saving CV care
is less important.
Our study had several limitations. Because of the
design of NHANES, we only had access to a single
UACR and eGFR determination, rather than the mul-
tiple measures. However, prior studies have used this
method to ascertain CKD [21, 26]. In addition, we
were able to determine insurance status only at a sin-
gle point in time. Patients may have had only a lim-
ited period of uninsurance or insured patients may
have subsequently lost their insurance. Nonetheless,
our classification of insurance status based on a single
assessment was associated with significant differences
in long-term outcomes.
Conclusions
In conclusion, in a nationally representative sample of
individuals with albuminuria and preserved eGFR, both
uninsurance and public insurance were associated with
increased mortality compared to private insurance, even
after controlling for sociodemographic, health status,
and health care variables. Given the burdens of kidney
disease both to the affected individuals, families, and the
health care system, we must wait to see if efforts to pro-
vide comprehensive health care--by improving access to
care and the quality of care received--will be able to
help to reduce costs, morbidity and mortality for those
with early evidence of CKD.
