Testing for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is a widely recommended practice for population-based
genetic association studies. However, current methods for this test assume a simple random sample and may not
be appropriate for sample surveys with complex survey designs. In this paper, the authors present a test for Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium that adjusts for the sample weights and correlation of data collected in complex surveys. The
authors perform this test by using a simple adjustment to procedures developed to analyze data from complex
survey designs available within the SAS statistical software package (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
Using 90 genetic markers from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the authors found that
survey-adjusted and -unadjusted estimates of the disequilibrium coefficient were generally similar within self-
reported races/ethnicities. However, estimates of the variance of the disequilibrium coefficient were significantly
different between the 2 methods. Because the results of the survey-adjusted tests account for correlation among
participants sampled within the same cluster, and the possibility of having related individuals sampled from the
same household, the authors recommend use of this test when analyzing genetic data originating from sample
surveys with complex survey designs to assess deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

Increases in the availability of genetic data have resulted
in a growing number of studies attempting to characterize
genetic susceptibility to common complex diseases. How-
ever, few genetic associations reported as significant are
replicated in multiple studies. Departures from Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in control populations may
indicate systematic genotyping errors and other biases that
could lead to lack of replication (1­3). Therefore, testing
HWE of marker genotype frequencies has been widely rec-
ommended as a crucial step in any population-based genetic
association study (4).
Several methods have been developed to test HWE in
simple random samples (SRSs). Emigh (5) compares vari-
ous tests for the goodness of fit of a population with HWE
with respect to their power and the accuracy of their distri-
butional approximations. Several exact tests for HWE have
been proposed (6­8). Bayesian approaches to HWE tests
have been discussed recently (9­11). Still, the most com-
mon way to test for departures from HWE is through a
goodness-of-fit v2 test (12).
When data are expensive to collect for a population-based
genetic association study, it can be cost-efficient to sample
in 2 or more stages. Whittemore and Halpern (13) described
multistage sampling in genetic epidemiology and used ge-
netic studies of US blacks and of prostate cancer to examine
some design issues involved in multistage sampling. Scott
and Wild (14) examined logistic regression models in case-
control studies in which controls (and possibly cases) were
obtained by using a complex sampling plan involving mul-
tistage sampling. It is important to investigate the proper

stage surveys.
Selection of samples in surveys rarely involves just sim-
ple random sampling. Instead, more complex sampling
schemes are usually used, involving, for example, stratifica-
tion and multistage sampling. Point estimates and the vari-
ance of population parameters are impacted by the value of
each observation's analysis weight, adjustments for selec-
tion probabilities, and other survey design features such as
stratification and clustering. Hence, the assumption of sim-
ple random sampling can yield biased point estimates and/or
an underestimation of the variance of the point estimates if
the complex sampling design is ignored.
In this paper, we derive and present an appropriate test for
deviations in HWE in the analysis of population-based ge-
netic data obtained from sample surveys with complex sur-
vey designs. We compare this method with results from
goodness-of-fit v2 tests that assume an SRS by using data
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Test for HWE
Suppose n individuals are genotyped at a biallelic (Aa)
marker. We are interested in some basic properties of this
marker, such as genotype frequency, allele frequency,
100(1 À a) % confidence intervals of these frequencies,
and whether it is in HWE.
Let Yij
¼ 1 if the jth allele of a marker of the ith individual
is A; Yij
¼ 0 otherwise (j ¼ 1, 2, and i ¼ 1, 2, . . ., n). Let Wi
be the sample weight assigned to the ith individual and n1
,
n2
, and n3
denote the genotype frequencies of AA, Aa, and
aa, respectively. The weighted allele frequency for the allele
A is then given by

The impact of departures from simple random sampling
on the precision of the estimated frequency can be measured
by the design effect that represents the combined effect of
stratification, clustering, unequal selection probabilities, and
weighting adjustments for nonresponse and noncoverage.

We test HWE by using a goodness-of-fit v2 test. For samples
large enough, the expected values for the 3 estimated geno-
typic counts are given in Table 1.

Rao and Scott (16, 17) studied the impact of design ef-
fects on standard v2 and likelihood ratio tests for estimated
proportions in one-way and multiway tables. They showed
that the test statistic is asymptotically distributed as
a weighted sum of independent v2
1
variables and that the
weights are the eigenvalues of a generalized design-effects
matrix. Their analyses showed that survey design can have
a substantial impact on the type 1 error. For one-way tables,
the SURVEYFREQ procedure in SAS software provides
a design-based goodness-of-fit test when null proportions
are specified using the first-order and second-order correc-
tions given by Rao and Scott. The Rao-Scott (RS) v2 test
statistic is computed as QRS
¼ QP
=d, where d is a design
correction that requires knowledge of variance estimates (or
design effects) for only individual cells in the goodness-of-
fit test statistic. For a one-way table with k cells, QRS has
a v2 distribution with (k À 1) degrees of freedom. The
computation of QRS
using the SURVEYFREQ procedure
in SAS software is given in Appendix 1 (18). We derive
the design correction for the v2 test to test for HWE from
first principles.

design-effects estimates of genotype frequency.
Application to NHANES III: US population-based survey
with complex design
NHANES is a nationally representative survey of the US
population conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics. Genetic data are available through the National
Center for Health Statistics on 7,159 participants from phase
2 of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III). Linkage of the NHANES III pheno-
type data with this genetic information provides the oppor-
tunity to conduct a vast array of outcome studies designed to
investigate the association of a wide variety of health factors
with genetic variation (19, 20).
The initial stage of sampling in the NHANES III design
consisted of stratifying and selecting primary sampling
units, which are counties or groups of counties in the United
States. The primary sampling units were assigned to a par-
ticular stratum based on health and demographic informa-
tion such as age, sex, and ethnicity and are selected with
probability proportional to population size. After the pri-
mary sampling units were selected, they were subsampled
successively in terms of census enumeration districts, clus-
ters of households, households, eligible persons, and, finally,
sample persons. Specific populations including young chil-
dren, older persons, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican
Americans were oversampled. Multiple sample persons
could be selected from the same household. Each sampled
person was assigned the inverse of his or her selection prob-
ability as the sampling weight. The final analysis weights
incorporated the selection probabilities and include adjust-
ments for nonresponse. The nonresponse-adjusted weights
were further poststratified by age, gender, and race/ethnicity
to account for noncoverage and to bring the final national
estimates in line with population counts (21).
We examined 90 variants in 50 genes that may play a role
in the etiology of several diseases or conditions of public
health significance. In this study, we considered the 3 major
self-reported race/ethnic populations in the United States:
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican
American. To explore the effect of differential sampling
from multiple ethnic populations, we also considered these
3 race/ethnicity groups combined. We removed any variants
with expected frequencies of less than 5 for each genotype
under the null hypothesis to avoid potential problems asso-
ciated with v2 approximation, yielding 72, 68, 70, and 75
variants for non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,
Mexican Americans, and the combined race/ethnicity
group, respectively. The expected frequency was calculated
by multiplying the effective sample size by the genotype
frequency. The effective sample size is the sample size di-
vided by the design correction for the genotype frequency
under the null hypothesis. To determine the origin and ex-
tent of differences between the DA HWE tests that adjusted
for the NHANES III complex survey design with HWE tests
conducted by assuming an SRS, we examined the differ-
ences in minor allele frequencies, HWD coefficients, and
variances of the HWD coefficient.
RESULTS
The DA and SRS minor allele frequencies were not so
different in any of the populations. However, the range was
largest for the combined race/ethnicity group (combined--
median: 0.0041, range: À0.152, 0.1021) compared with the
separate races/ethnicities (non-Hispanic whites--median:
0.0006, range: À0.0111, 0.0142; non-Hispanic blacks--
median: 0.0007, range: À0.0062, 0.0073; Mexican
Americans--median: 0.0002, range: À0.0132, 0.0139)
(Figure 1).
The differences between the DA and SRS HWD coeffi-
cients followed a pattern similar to that for the differences
between the minor allele frequencies. The combined popu-
lation had the largest range (non-Hispanic whites--median:
0.0006, range: À0.0046, 0.0079; non-Hispanic blacks--
median: À0.0001, range: À0.0039, 0.0057; Mexican
Americans--median: À0.00003, range: À0.0101, 0.0067;
combined--median: À0.0016, range: À0.034, 0.0106).
The majority of differences between the DA variance
estimates and variance estimates calculated by assuming
an SRS design were greater than zero in all of the popula-
tions (Figure 1). We found that the design correction varied
from 0.64 to 3.45 with a median value of 1.44 for

non-Hispanic whites, from 0.47 to 2.61 with a median value
of 1.18 for non-Hispanic blacks, from 0.35 to 3.30 with
a median value of 1.34 for Mexican Americans, and from
0.72 to 14.45 with a median value of 2.68 for the combined
race/ethnicity group compared with each race/ethnicity
group. The coefficients of variation of weights for non-
Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican
Americans were 75.7, 45.9, and 60.7, respectively, whereas
the coefficient of variance for the 3 combined race/ethnicity
groups was 132.1.
The discrepancy between P values from DA v2 tests and
from SRS v2 tests was higher for the combined group com-
pared with the separate populations (Figure 1). Figure 2
shows scatter plots of P values obtained from the DA
and SRS v2 tests for HWE for non-Hispanic whites, non-
Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans, and all 3 race/
ethnicity groups combined. The Spearman coefficients of
correlation between DA and SRS P values were 0.49,
0.73, 0.74, and 0.69 for non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic
blacks, Mexican Americans, and the combined group,
respectively.
We assumed a level of significance of a ¼ 0.05 for the
HWE tests. Genetic variants with significant DA test results
but nonsignificant SRS results, or vice versa, for non-
Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans,
and the combined groups are presented in Tables 3­6. All 4
markers in Table 3 resulted in HWE for the SRS test and
HWD for the DA test. Fifty percent of the markers tested in
Tables 4 and 5 resulted in HWE for the SRS test and HWD
for the DA test. Of the 22 markers shown in Table 6, 18 were
in HWD for the SRS test and HWE for the DA test.
DISCUSSION
In this paper, we present a method of testing HWE of
genetic data obtained from large-scale population surveys
that incorporate design features such as clustering, stratifi-
cation, and unequal weights. We found, within ethnic pop-
ulations, that our DA method provides similar estimates of
HWD coefficients but different estimates of the variance of
the HWD coefficients compared with the unadjusted
method. The test statistics derived from the 2 methods were
not significantly different in general, but, in a few cases,
different conclusions were possible. Choosing the results
of the SRS test would not be appropriate in these situations
because these results could be biased. Regarding the

combined population, we found that both the HWD coeffi-
cient and variance differed between the methods, yielding
significant differences in P values. Hence, all analyses of
HWE need to incorporate sample weights and the cluster
design to avoid misinterpretation of results.
In a recent paper, Li and Graubard (22) derived a test for
HWE for complex sample designs by extending the standard
Pearson v2 test to a quadratic test statistic that converges in
distribution to a linear combination of independently iden-
tically distributed v2 random variables. The coefficients of
the linear combination are eigenvalues (generalized design
effects) of a generalized design matrix. The first-order RS
adjustment corrects the asymptotic expectation of the Pear-
son statistic by dividing the test statistic by the mean of the
unknown eigenvalues. As shown in Appendix 1, the SUR-
VEYFREQ procedure estimates this mean as a function of
the design-effect estimates of the cell proportions. In our
method, we directly derived the approximate variance of

correction as a function of the design-effect estimates of
genotype frequency (Appendix 2). Li and Graubard also
examined the accuracy of type I error for the minor allele
frequencies and the number of degrees of freedom for esti-
mating the covariance matrix that affect the asymptotic dis-
tribution. The degrees of freedom for the variance estimates
can be rather small in some situations and thus using an F
distribution instead of a v2 distribution works much better,
as noted by Thomas and Rao (23).

data available to researchers for analysis. Therefore, allele
frequencies, genotype frequencies, and associations be-
tween disease and genetic variants are unbiased estimates
of the respective population parameters. For example, gene
variant databases such as the International HapMap Project
(http://www.hapmap.org) and the SNP500Cancer Database
(http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov) are convenience samples
and may not well represent the target populations (24, 25).
Population-based estimates obtained from the NHANES III
survey may help in estimating the US population that ben-
efits from genomic-based tools, such as risk factor reduc-
tion; disease screening efforts; or diagnostic tests, drugs, or
other preventive or therapeutic interventions.
There have been discussions about whether the sampling
design must be considered in the analysis of survey data
from large-scale health surveys. Some guidelines are pro-
vided for when to use sample weights and the features of the
sample design in the analysis of survey data (26, 27). There
are several reasons to take into account the sampling design
in testing for HWE. First, the HWE test examines whether

the population represented by the sample is in HWE. As-
suming the sample is selected by using an SRS design does
not result in testing HWE for the target population. Second,
some correlation is likely among participants sampled
within the same cluster, such as the selection of multiple
individuals in a household in the NHANES III sample. The
number of individuals selected in a household in the sample
ranged from 1 to 11 with an average of 1.6, and some of
them may be related. When the v2 goodness-of-fit test for
HWE is used on samples with related individuals, the type I
error could be greatly inflated.
When calculating the variance for DA estimates, the first
2 stages of the sample design--strata and primary sampling
units--are considered. When there are more related people
in households within a primary sampling unit, the intraclass
correlation that measures the internal homogeneity for the
primary sampling units, and consequently the variance of
DA, increases. This increase in variance is taken into ac-
count in the design correction. A test for HWE suitable for
any samples with related individuals has been proposed
(28). However, our method does not require prior knowl-
edge of the pedigree structure and can account for the cor-
relation among the sampled members whether they are
related or not.
Tests of HWE may be used to examine the associations
between genetic variants and diseases. For example, Lee
(29) proposed scanning the genome for disease-susceptible
genes by testing for deviations from HWE in a gene bank of
affected individuals under the assumption that the source
population from which the cases arise is in HWE. Chen
and Chatterjee (30) proposed an alternative analytic strategy
to assess the association between a binary disease outcome
and a genetic marker by comparing the observed genotype
frequencies of cases with the expected genotype frequencies
of controls, assuming HWE. Song and Elston (31) derived
an HWD trend test by calculating the difference between the
HWE test statistic for cases and controls to fine-map
a disease-susceptible locus.
Methods to appropriately analyze genetic data from stud-
ies involving complex survey designs, such as the proposed
genome-wide association studies of NHANES III and the
National Children's Study (www.nationalchildrensstudy.
gov), will be needed in the near future. The HWE test pro-
posed in this paper represents an essential step in addressing
that need.

For one-way tables, the RS (16, 17) v2 statistic provides
a design-based goodness-of-fit test for specified null pro-
portions with the ``TESTP¼'' option in the SURVEYFREQ
procedure in SAS software. Under the null hypothesis, the
RS v2 statistic approximately follows a v2 distribution with
(C À 1) degrees of freedom for a table with C levels. The RS
v2 QRS
is computed as QRS
