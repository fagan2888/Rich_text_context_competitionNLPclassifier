Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of selective arterial embolization (SAE)
in the treatment of renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs).
Methods: This was a retrospective review of medical records and imaging findings from patients
with renal AMLs who attended our clinic and received SAE between January 2007 and January
2014. Only patents with complete medical records, preoperative computed tomography scans
using typical imaging and follow-up data were included.
Results: A total of 79 patients were enrolled in the study. Technical and clinical success rates were
100% and 91% (n ¼ 72), respectively. Only two patients experienced major complications. Post-
embolization syndrome (i.e. fever, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting) was reported in 68 (86%)
patients, but all symptoms were mild and resolved with conservative measures. Mean radiological
and clinical follow-up periods were 16.8 and 35.9 months, respectively. In 75 (95%) patients,
tumours decreased in size; mean Æ SD tumour size significantly decreased from 8.4 Æ 3.5 cm
pre-embolization to 6.7 Æ 3.0 cm post-embolization.
Conclusions: This study provides long-term evidence that SAE is a safe and effective method in
the treatment of patients with renal AMLs.

vessels, smooth muscle and adipose tissue.1
The blood vessels within AMLs are
abnormal with no internal elastic lamina
and the smooth muscle is replaced by fibrous
tissue making the vessels rigid, tortuous
and prone to aneurysm formation and
rupture.2 Indeed, it has been docu-
mented that AMLs show a high likelihood
of rupture during their clinical course,
with the presentation of haematuria, retro-
peritoneal bleeding and haemorrhagic
shock.3
The tumours are classically identified by
the characteristic presence of fat on com-
puted tomography (CT), magnetic reson-
ance imaging or ultrasonography of the
kidneys. They are found in <0.3% of the
general population and account for about
3% of all tumours in the kidneys.4
The majority of AMLs occur sporadically
whilst the remaining cases are associated
with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), an
autosomal dominant disorder.5 Although
some renal AMLs are asymptomatic, they
have a propensity to increase in size and
may cause local complications.6 Common
symptoms of AMLs include flank pain,
palpable mass, gross haematuria, anaemia
and symptoms related to a mass effect,
such as abdominal pain, abdominal
fullness, abdominal visceral compression
and anorexia.7 Management recommen-
dations are based on tumour size and
symptoms,8 and treatment goals focus on
preventing acute events, preserving renal
parenchyma and maintaining long-term
kidney function.9 While selective arterial
embolization (SAE) for AMLs has gained
popularity in recent years, few large
studies are available with long-term fol-
low-up data.10,11 The objective of this
retrospective study was to evaluate the
long-term efficacy and safety of SAE
in the treatment of AMLs in patients treated
at our institution over a 7-year period (2007
to 2014).
Patients and methods
Patient population
This was a retrospective review of the
medical records and imaging findings
from patients with renal AMLs who
attended the Department of Interventional
Radiology and Vascular Surgery, Peking
University First Hospital, Beijing, China
and received SAE between January 2007
and January 2014. Only patents with com-
plete medical records, preoperative CT scans
using typical imaging and follow-up data
were included. Demographic data, type of
AMLs (sporadic or TSC-related), clinical
symptoms, tumour size and location, tech-
nical success, clinical success, complications
and tumour relapse were recorded by one of
three investigators (G.N., Z.Y. or B.Z.). The
primary indications for SAE were acute
haemorrhage, haematuria, pain or asymp-
tomatic size greater than 4 cm. Indications
for unplanned repeat embolization included
uncontrolled symptoms, re-bleeding and
subsequent increase in the size of the mass.
This study received institutional review
board approval from the Ethics Committee
of Peking University First Hospital, Beijing,
China before commencement and because it
was a retrospective study, patient informed
consent was not required.
Angiography methods
Angiography was performed in all patients
under local anaesthesia via the femoral
artery. Abdominal aortography had been
taken to identify renal arteries and exclude
alternative feeding vessels. In addition,
selective renal arteriography was performed
through a standard 5-F catheter (Figure 1).
Once the feeding vessels to the targeted
AML were identified, they were catheterized
supra-selectively using a coaxial microcath-
eter. Based on the size and number of
the feeding vessels of the tumour,
Wang et al. 707
an appropriate amount of embolic material
had been injected under continuous fluoro-
scopic guidance to prevent reflux and non-
target embolization. Bleomycin-lipiodol
emulsion and 300­500 mm nonspherical
polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles were
used as embolic agents to interrupt the
blood flow of the AMLs. Coils were also
applied to seal feeding vessels when aneur-
ysms were found on the angiograms. Coils
are increasingly used to treat aneurysms and
provide satisfactory proximal occlusion as a
complement to distal occlusion to maximize
the embolic effect and so facilitate the rapid
cessation of blood flow in a targeted inflow
artery.12 If the lesion was large or had
multiple feeding vessels, embolization was
staged to keep complication rates low.6
Tumour size was measured as the max-
imal diameter on axial CT images and the
shrinkage rate was calculated by comparing
the change in the cross-sectional diameter of
the lesion with previous imaging. Technical
success was defined as tumour vascular
occlusion characterized by cessation of
flow in the target vessels and lack of
tumour staining. Clinical success was
defined as no worsening of symptoms, no
evidence of severe complications attributed
to SAE and/or a re-bleeding episode after
SAE. Post-embolization syndrome was
defined as fever, abdominal pain, nausea or
vomiting after SAE that the patient experi-
enced during hospitalization. Tumour
relapse after SAE was defined as recurrent
symptoms (i.e. flank pain, tumour bleeding,
or tumour rupture) requiring further treat-
ment or tumour growth larger than 2.0 cm
measured according to follow-up images.
However, if a repeat embolization was used

to control persisting symptoms or tumour
growth this was considered a failure of
initial treatment. Tumours selected for
staged treatment at initial presentation
were not deemed failures due to repeat
embolization as part of this treatment plan.
Statistical analyses
Nominal variables were summarized as
counts and percentages whereas continuous
variables were reported as mean Æ SD. To
compare groups, 2-test and Student's t-test
were used for nominal data and continuous
variables, respectively. Data analyses were
performed using IBM SPSS software
(version 19.0 for WindowsÕ; IBM Corp,
Armonk, NY, USA). A P-value < 0.05
(2-sided) was considered to indicate statis-
tical significance.
Results
In total, 79 patients (60 [76%] women and 19
[24%] men) received SAE for AMLs in the
7-year study period (Table 1). Of these
patients, 22 (28%) had a background of
TSC and 57 (72%) had sporadic AMLs.
Overall, the mean Æ SD age for the patient
population at diagnosis was 40.3 Æ 14.8
years (range, 12­75 years). The subgroup
of patients with TSC were significantly
younger than those with sporadic AMLs
(Table 1; P < 0.001). Common presenting
symptoms were flank pain (45 [57%]
patients) and haematuria (10 [13%]
patients). AMLs were discovered inciden-
tally in 31 (39%) patients who were exam-
ined for other reasons.
With regard to the location of the AMLs,
19 (24%) patients had involvement of in the
left kidney only, 14 (18%) patients the right
kidney only and 46 (58%) patients had
bilateral involvement (Table 1). The lesions
were multifocal in 56 (71%) patients.
Among the 22 patients with TSC, all had
multifocal lesions and 21 (95%) had
bilateral AMLs. There was also a trend
towards bilateral and multiple masses in the
TSC subgroup (Table 1; P < 0.001). Pre-
embolization, the largest lesion detected was
18.0 cm and only one lesion was less than
4 cm. Single or multiple aneurysms were
found in 10 (13%) patients and retroperi-
toneal haematomas in 22 (28%) patients.
In total, 48 (61%) patients underwent
SAE to treat bleeding/symptomatic AMLs
and in 31 (39%) patients SAE was used as a
prophylactic treatment against high-risk
AMLs (i.e. size >4 cm, abnormal vascula-
ture on CT). All patients received the
bleomycin/lipiodol emulsion with PVA and
10 (13%) patients also had coiling of aneur-
ysms. Embolization was technically success-
ful in all cases, with de-vascularization of the
embolized feeding vessels at angiography.
Mean radiological and clinical follow-up
periods were 16.8 and 35.9 months, respect-
ively. During the 3-year clinical follow-up
period, 34 (43%) patients had planned
repeat embolization and five (6%) patients
needed unplanned repeat embolization
due to tumour relapse. There was no statis-
tically significant difference between the
TSC and sporadic subgroups in the pro-
portion of patients requiring repeat
embolization.
Computed tomography scans of patients
showed that in 75 (95%) patients tumours
decreased in size, in four (5%) patients they
were stable and no patients had tumours
that increased in size. At the end of the radio-
graphic follow-up period (16.8 months),
mean Æ SD tumour size for all patients
was statistically significantly smaller post-
embolization compared with pre-emboliza-
tion (mean Æ SD: 6.7 Æ 3.0 cm versus
8.4 Æ 3.5 cm, respectively; P < 0.001).
All measured tumours were reduced by a
mean Æ SD of 1.7 Æ 1.3 cm (20.7% Æ 16.0%)
following SAE and there was a similar
decrease in size for the TSC group
(17.9% Æ 10.8%) and the sporadic group
(21.7% Æ 17.6%) (Table 1).
Wang et al. 709
In terms of complications, 68 (86%)
patients experienced post-embolization syn-
drome (i.e. fever, pain or nausea after SAE).
Most of these patients had mild symptoms
that lasted < 5 days and resolved with con-
servative treatment. Only two (3%) patients
experienced major complications. One 12-
year old girl with TSC and bilateral AMLs
developed a urinary tract infection and
subsequent acute renal insufficiency and
was treated with a course of antibiotics
and dialysis. The other patient had pleural
effusion after SAE but the condition
resolved after thoracic drainage. Therefore,
of the 79 cases, 72 patients (91%) achieved a
clinical success: two patients experienced

Discussion
Haemorrhage from AMLs can be life-threa-
tening, and so treating symptomatic patients
or patients with lesions of >4 cm has become
widespread practice.7 Due to the current
availability of microcatheters and superior
image quality of diagnostic equipment, SAE
has gained favour as a treatment option for
AMLs in both the elective and emergency
settings over the past decade. Bleomycin-
lipiodol emulsion and PVA were success-
fully used as the main embolic agents in this
present study. Bleomycin, a complex of 11
glycopeptide antitumour antibiotics,13
acts by intercalation of DNA and RNA.14
Lipiodol has the advantage over other
embolic agents of causing permanent occlu-
sion at a capillary level and hence inducing
tissue necrosis.15 Lipiodol also aids in the
visualization of the embolic mixture, which
helps prevent reflux and non-target embol-
ization. PVA is available with different
particle sizes and is considered a permanent
embolic agent.16 At a particle size of 300­
500 mm, PVA facilitates occlusion of the
distal vascular bed of the tumour.17 Only a
small proportion of patients (13%) in this
study required additional coiling of
aneurysms.
In this present study of 79 patients at a
single centre in China, SAE for renal AMLs
achieved a technical success of 100%, clin-
ical success of 91% and tumour shrinkage
was significant. The present findings of a
mean Æ SD reduction in axial dimension of
the tumours of 20.7% Æ 16.0% agree with a
previous report18 and demonstrate the effi-
cacy of SAE on renal AMLs. In addition,
the present results were similar to the con-
clusions of a systematic review of 31 studies
that involved 524 AML cases treated with
transarterial embolization, which found a
mean technical success rate of 93.3% and
no procedural mortality.19 However,
the authors reported that among 263
AML patients with a mean follow-up of
39 months, angiomyolipoma was reduced by
a mean of 3.4 cm (38.3%), a value higher
than the present result (mean Æ SD decrease:
1.7 Æ 1.3 cm). A possible explanation for the
discrepancy may be the difference in the
radiological follow-up period; the mean
follow-up period for the present study was
only 16.8 months.
This present study found no differences in
pre-embolization mass size, decrease in
mass size with embolization, complications,
requirement for repeat embolization or
haemorrhage between patients with and
without TSC. Treatment options for
AMLs are often complicated by the presence
of bilateral and multiple lesions, which
particularly affect the TSC subgroup.20 In
the present study, 71% of patients had
multiple lesions, rendering traditional surgi-
cal techniques for preserving renal function,
such as partial or total nephrectomy, a less
favourable option.6 TSC is an autosomal
dominant disease affecting approximately
2 million people globally.21 Mutations in
the TSC1 and TSC2 genes, important regu-
lators of the mammalian target of rapamy-
cin (mTOR) signalling pathway, result in
the development of tumours involving mul-
tiple organ systems.22 As many as 80% of
patients with TSC develop renal AMLs and
the tumours are frequently bilateral and
multiple.23
As observed in this present study, several
patients may have multiple, large or
re-growing AMLs that require re-
embolization. However, repeated emboliza-
tions may cause loss of normal renal
parenchyma and renal function. Therefore,
an effective pharmacological treatment is
required to address this problem. A recent
study suggests that the mTOR inhibitor,
everolimus, may become an effective treat-
ment option for AMLs in TSC patients.24
Wang et al. 711
Moreover, everolimus is currently licenced
in Europe and USA for the treatment of
AMLs in adult patients with TSC. As more
data from large clinical trials becomes avail-
able, mTOR inhibitors may be approved for
the treatment of TSC-AMLs worldwide.
A main limitation of the present study
was its retrospective design. In addition, the
sample size was small; several patients had
to be excluded from the study because they
lacked complete radiological follow-up
data. Prospective studies are required to
confirm these findings and better evaluate
the characteristics of AMLs and clinical
outcomes.
In conclusion, this present study provides
long-term evidence that SAE using bleomy-
cin-lipiodol emulsion and PVA is a safe and
effective method in controlling haemor-
rhage, improving clinical symptoms and
preventing tumour progression in patients
with renal AMLs.
