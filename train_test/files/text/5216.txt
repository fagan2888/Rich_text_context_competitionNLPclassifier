Margaret Atwood's (2000) novel, The Blind Assassin, opens
with a striking image. Narrator-protagonist, Iris (Chase)
Griffen, aged 83, states that her sister, Laura, drove Iris's car
off of a Toronto bridge in 1945, decades before. This fatal act
on Laura's part likely constituted a suicide. Readers, as detec-
tives, must attempt to piece together the novel's fragmentary
narrative to discover the event's tragic cause and assign blame
accordingly. The audience will hope to uncover the nature of
Iris's multifaceted relationships with other characters whose
deaths, disappearances, or removals she also influences
blindly but purposefully before vanishing herself into "the
unknown country," which does not signify either a place of
rest or torment for her, as it does for Shakespeare's Hamlet,
considering suicide, but somewhere else entirely. Atwood's
readers, searching for clues about Iris and the cast, may find
assembling the book's parts arduous. Iris's final destination,
located beyond her castle and other residences, exists beyond
her milieu's static, Cartesian-based dualisms and past the
boundaries of southern Ontario's patriarchally constructed
page. For Atwood, Hamlet's quandary of whether "to be or
not to be" may represent the question protagonists ask.
However, for Iris, both being and not being signifies the
answer, without the requisite for female characters to commit
to any temporal-spatial location. Atwood presents The Blind
Assassin as a multilayered, postmodernist novel foreground-
ing the memoir of an unreliable female narrator with a failing
memory and changing stances. Atwood employs complex
compositional strategies highlighting poststructural and femi-
nist positions that test readers' trust in the narrative view and,
thus, the textual message itself via a negotiation with the
author that Ross Chambers (1984) calls the reader/writer
"contract" (p. 22). As an author-as-character herself, Iris
shares her conflicting roles with The Blind Assassin's readers
as a pawn to family members, nemesis to her sister, and
hoped-for heroine to progenitors as she resides in locations
offering diverging but masculinist landscapes. Atwood
explores Iris's problematic identities as an autobiographer,

From an Obscured Gaze to a Seeing Eye?
Iris as Victim, Villain, and Avenger in the
Role of Writer-as-Assassin in Margaret
Atwood's The Blind Assassin
Tara Hembrough1
Abstract
In the postmodern period, first-person-limited, unreliable, female narrators may have a greater difficulty in "seeing" and, thus,
depicting their landscapes than previous eras' storytellers. Iris (Chase) Griffen, narrator-protagonist of Margaret Atwood's
The Blind Assassin, spins a complicated, self-reflective text exploring her attempts at composing a world vision that consumes
the novel's larger part. Iris's search for answers about her identity as well as that of other characters may leave readers in the
lurch, waiting for their "story," in Ross Chambers's terms, as an agreed-upon product. Nonetheless, having amassed assorted
textual materials, Iris stockpiles the ammunition she needs to do her "job" as a storyteller-assassin who creates and destroys,
as characters suffer a fall. Assuming guises dependent on location, Iris enacts the conflicting roles of a victim, social product,
villain, and blind assassin to assault her culture's masculinist architectures that bar women's points of views in opposition
to what Henry James presents as the unending panoramas offered by his metaphorical "House of Fiction." Iris's struggle to
construct her life story mirrors the difficulty many women face more broadly, in which they face competing, irreconcilable
values. In the novel, Iris's ability to play differing parts with equal aplomb compels readers to view her as a complex narrator,
constructing and assassinating fellow characters to render her female descendants' fates as open ended.

novelist, and writer-as-assassin as Iris both tells and retracts a
story in which she is simultaneously a casualty, product, vil-
lain, and usurper of her masculinist culture as aligned with
her ever-changing perspectives on her history.
Chambers explains that the relationship an author and
audience members forge
depends on social agreements, implicit pacts or contracts
[between the parties] in order to produce exchanges that are
themselves a function of desires, purposes, constraints . . . . It is
only on the strength of such agreements that narratives can exert
their impact and produce change . . . [or offer a] point. (p. 22)
Readers possess expectations they demand be met, and nov-
elists must "earn the authority to narrate in the very act of
storytelling" and "master certain `tactical' devices" of their
art to clench the deal with audience-members-as-consumers
(p. 23). Authors must decide how best to employ their weap-
ons of choice, including point-of-view considerations, in
composing the written form. In The Blind Assassin, Atwood
refuses to conform to some traditional constraints of "show-
manship" that authors adopt to create novels that, according
to Chambers, function as commodities they hope to sell both
literally and figuratively. Yet, to draw an audience, Atwood
does enact the key storytelling strategy that Chambers argues
novelists must apply to produce effective prose. In fashion-
ing Iris as a narrator-as-writer with a story to reveal, Atwood
proposes to share what Chambers calls a "secret" (p. 25),
even if this enigma's contents remain mysterious, both unex-
plainable and nontransmittable, for audience members as the
outcome of their engaging the book. Because, as narrator,
Iris commits to no single view of events in The Blind
Assassin, Atwood's readers may never discern whether or
not Iris is culpable for Laura's death or even comprehend
how Laura's demise should be seen: as tragic, redemptive, or
even, based on Enlightenment-grounded binaries, meaning-
less. Atwood's refusal to provide an answer to her book's
riddle represents a positive outcome for the destinies of
female family successors, who may fill in their own blanks
concerning their stories' conclusions.
The Blind Assassin: A Literature Review
Since The Blind Assassin's publication, scholars have exam-
ined it through various lenses, including the psychoanalyti-
cal, gender-concerned, politico-economic, historiographic,
and narratological. J. Brooks Bouson (2003), applying femi-
nist theory, proposes that Atwood's female characters are
bound together by their "victimization," whereas Hilde
Staels (2004), identifying Iris as a writer contemplating the
past, focuses on her "self-victimization." Paula Farca (2010)
argues that Atwood's women, parodying male discourses to
illuminate their problematic status, form intergenerational
liaisons, and Susan Watkins (2013) discusses how Iris, an
aging female writer, tells her story. From a politico-economic
view, Alaina Kaus (2015) argues that with market liberalism
at play, the characters themselves possess market values.
Implementing a historiographic stance, S. Isabella and
Sundarsingh (2010) explore how Atwood's female charac-
ters utilize "History and Fiction" to foreground their
accounts, Coral Ann Howells (1996) portrays the novel's
interrogation of typical Canadian accounts, and Alan
Robinson (2006) explains how Iris resurrects family ghosts
via historiographical and hermeneutic systems. Discussing
narratological concerns, Ellen McWilliams (2007) reveals
the obstacles Iris negotiates that female writers have met tra-
ditionally, Chung-Hao Ku (2004) documents implementa-
tions of Hélène Cixous's écriture féminine bridging the
divide between the self and the Other, and Magali Cornier
Michael (2010) places Iris among female writers redefining
narrative modes, including by, according to Shuli Barzilai
(2010), utilizing ekphrasis to formulate meaning.
Through the female characters' artistically based social
negotiations, Bouson (2010) argues, The Blind Assassin
presents an account of early 20th-century women's interac-
tions with patriarchal culture, which they interrogate through
storytelling acts. By assembling the women's accounts, read-
ers have an opportunity to sort out Atwood's book's "puzzle"
(pp. 15-16). Anette Barnard and Kruger (2005) argue that
Atwood's disruption of cohesion and imposition of multiple
voices fragmenting the text allow readers to enact its mean-
ing. Moreover, Earl Ingersoll (2003) calls the novel a "mys-
tery" for which Atwood rejects a totalistic conclusion,
whereas Ruth Parkin-Gounelas (2004) proposes that Iris
introduces deceptive memories and multiple layers into the
narrative to obfuscate her part in Laura's fate, and Fiona
Tolan (2010) poses Iris as the book's villain. Nevertheless,
no one has examined how Iris's positioning of herself,
through Atwood's postmodern narrative technique and ren-
dering of point-of-view, affects readers'ability to understand
and, thus, champion Iris as a simultaneous casualty, product,
villain, and usurper of her masculinist world, which she con-
structs and erases to refute her series of patriarchally inspired,
spatio-temporal placements.
Genre Considerations
The Blind Assassin offers a collection of interfacing texts, and
Iris's memoir, a first-person-limited narrative written in pres-
ent tense, spanning her life, and directed to her granddaugh-
ter, Sabrina, comprises its bulk, while as its outermost frame,
Iris presents another autobiographical but loosely rendered
contemplation of herself as an aging writer composed the
same year. The book, somewhat linearly assembled, is inter-
spersed with other texts, including photographs, newspaper
articles, and Laura's presumed novella, The Blind Assassin, a
third-person narrative illustrating an affair between a man and
woman in which the science-fiction tales of an unnamed fig-
ure resembling labor agitator and pulp writer, Alex Thomas,
are imbedded. With the novel's mise-en-abyme structure,
Hembrough 3
Atwood offers simultaneous discourses mirroring one another
thematically and, according to Margaret Reynolds and
Noakes (2002), creating a collage effect that seem to present
answers. Atwood renders Iris's account with historiographic
flair, and to locate a collective "truth" about Iris's motiva-
tions, readers might wish to impose a hierarchy on the book's
interlocking pieces. Yet, the audience will discover gaps and
inconsistencies in the larger text, which an anonymous, inter-
vening source has edited.
Atwood implies that compared with male counterparts
and even female predecessors, women writers, including
authors-as-characters, such as Iris, must adopt new strate-
gies, including a reconsideration of narrative perspective.
Composing The Blind Assassin as Iris's fragmented self-
narrative, Atwood, striking a hard bargain with readers-as-
consumers, asks them to question her text at all points. The
goal is to uncover facets of Iris's character as she describes
herself as a youth, wife, sister, lover, mother, and aging
writer, roles that she records and enacts varyingly according
to her changing locations and their patriarchally mandated
agendas. Foregrounding no single identity fulfills Iris's
desires for self-conception, and as the novel's premier "blind
assassin," she co-opts others' stories and formulates her own
narrative as a victim, product, villain, and avenger. In forging
her various presences, Iris, as a writer-assassin, is blinded to
her work's outcome, one that destroys while promoting
regenerative, if untold possibilities for herself and her lin-
eage. Iris contemplates her life in light of her impending
death to establish a fluid persona that she can affirm and that
female predecessors might validate or "buy," even if they
find themselves, like Atwood's readers, emptyhanded after-
wards, lacking a tangible grip on the answer-as-commodity
to the looming question she poses concerning the nature of
Iris's subjectivity and her progeny's heritage. Forestalling
readers' judgment of Iris's character as she navigates the
confining landscapes of her postwar, patriarchal milieu,
Atwood explores Iris's contradictory account as Iris moves
within a series of multilayered, male-dominated texts to
mold others' fates as she sees fit to propel herself and other
characters to a place beyond hegemonic categorizations
fixed by language's structures. Acting as an assassin by
occupation, Iris writes and unwrites others' identities, along
with her own, leaving them open for change in ways to
improve her progeny's vistas and to make her "point" in
closing the reader/writer contract as a professional for hire.
Mixing Truth and Fiction, or Truth Is Fiction
Via The Blind Assassin's innovative form, Atwood plays
with the audience's reader-based expectations for the novel
genre's conclusion, according to which members expect cer-
tain narratorial secrets to be unfolded. In writing her nonfic-
tional memoir and autobiography, Iris is supposed to be
sharing "truths" and imparting "realities." Moreover, the
newspaper articles, photos, and novella that she presents as
context for her work should render complexity to the book to
enact a "whole" or more complete picture for audience mem-
bers, with their purchasing power and, thus, clout involving
a successful reader/writer transaction. However, in a post-
modern schema, every new insight that Iris poses in the book
is one that is subject to change, as she creates, considers, and
advances contradictory claims about herself, family, and
community members. In the novel's present tense, Iris, a
writer of advanced age possessing Romantic compositional
notions, draws herself as a conduit for artistic impulses.
Inspired by her form, Iris moves her pen across the page and
lets her imagination take hold. Yet, simultaneously, Iris privi-
leges memory's place in (re)constructing the past. Art may
be inspired by the muse, and emotion-imbued memories
draw supposedly from the heart. Nonetheless, Iris's "insight-
fully" wrought memoir; clandestinely presented novella;
fable-like, science-fiction inserts; documentary-style news
clippings, and true-as-life photos represent fictional texts,
even though Iris keeps promising readers that she is convey-
ing accuracy in her events' rendition. For example, to show
gratitude to Laura and Alex for the guidance they have pro-
vided in her coming-of-age story by acting as bridges,
according to Chapter One's title, across which she walks, Iris
hides the novella's authorship until the end.
Iris's advances of so-called facts are followed by their
retractions, and Iris doctors the narrative in the same manner
that Laura cuts herself out of Iris's picnic photo with Alex to
meet both girls' desired vision of events. Readers, trying to
unlock the book's revelation, discover history, like Iris's
memoir, to be produced retrospectively and mediated as
such, while one is blinded to the current events' significance
as well. The Blind Assassin's plot elements, whirling in a
state of flux, never add up to some culminating point and
corresponding moment of Joycean epiphany for audience
members seeking this transactional, Modernistic experience.
Instead, Cherene Sherrard (1999) describes the "biomythog-
raphy" as a fictional "reenvisioning of a life experience
which reveals multilayered histories and collective memory"
(p. 130), and The Blind Assassin builds upon this genre.
Point-of-View Considerations
Twentieth-century writers and narratologists have produced
point-of-view theories, especially regarding the first-person-
limited, to which Atwood reacts in postmodern fashion in
composing The Blind Assassin through Iris's eyes. Henry
James (1881/1971), defining the limited viewpoint for
Realists, argues that writers must "represent life" according to
mimetic premises (p. 389). In implementing the limited view,
James believes, writers can fashion narrators possessing
unique perspectives. James states, "Humanity is immense,
and reality has a myriad of forms . . . Experience is never
limited; it is never complete" (p. 397). Calling for writers to
explore a character's psychological interior as opposed to
spinning intricate, mythico-wrought plots acted out by
4 SAGE Open
character types, James advises writers to "try and catch the
colour of life itself" by painting the perspectives of dynamic
characters involved in complex, remarkable situations (p. 413).
Implementing the first-person-limited, Realists desired to
offer intimate portraits of characters in opposition to proto-
types involving the invasive, "objective" presence of an
omniscient narrator dividing characters from readers.
However, Atwood takes James's tenets to their next logi-
cal, postmodern steps. First, depicted through Iris's perspec-
tive, Atwood questions whether either life or art, in which
persons and pieces represent copies of copies, mimeographed
through generations, can, according to Ferdinand Saussure's
(1983) and Jacques Derrida's (1976) poststructuralistic lin-
guistic models, signify anything of so-called original value.
In describing both her female progenitors' uncannily similar
lifestyles and their prized museum pieces, Iris exposes the
practices of replication perpetuating both gender roles and
art as commodification in the novel through a series of stand-
ing forms. Abiding by the dictates of those dead and gone,
IrisbelievessheandLaura"werebroughtupby"Grandmother
Adelia, with her portrait's eyes following them, and "her
conception of who [they] ought to be" (Atwood, 2000, p.
62), replicators of her own oppressive story at the Chase
mansion. In the book, Atwood, like James, also provides
readers with intimate introductions to elaborately detailed,
psychologically complex characters, including Iris and
Laura, possessing what E. M. Forster (1927/1956) calls
"round qualities" (p. 103). However, Atwood refuses to
allow readers to "know" her characters in that readers cannot
trust Iris's representation of her cast. Finally, Atwood shows
the million-fold choices that Iris, as protagonist, might make
via some Jamesian "window of opportunity" in her various
abodes without Iris ever having to commit to any path.
Encompassing the possibilities presented to her era's women,
Iris catalogs the colorful array of props and costumes she
amasses throughout life, with some serving as chapter names,
to place herself in each social setting. Nonetheless, Iris fails
to qualify any item as a treasured possession associated with
some core aspect of her "being."
In his Preface to Portrait of a Lady, James (1881/1971)
presents a metaphor involving the limited view invoking a
"house of fiction" offering inhabitants, peering outward,
multiple panoramas or sight angles. Occupants can see the
outer landscape's aspects depicted uniquely from windows at
differing levels. Depending on the window, one will have an
"impression distinct from any other" (p. 52) of a given tree in
the yard, for example. Applying this metaphor, James,
regarding "truth" as pluralistic and relativistic, argued that
with the limited view, authors could describe a character's
individualistic experiences in depth as opposed to rendering
society's collective moments in generic form. Similarly, fol-
lower Norman Friedman (1955) identifies the limited narra-
tor as a "fixed center" (p. 108) or camera lens filtering the
story's plot to provide a "genuine" picture of events.
However, in The Blind Assassin, Iris refuses to act as a
Jamesian membrane through which details pass fluidly to
grant readers free access to the narrative. Iris denies readers
any reward of understanding she, her "self," or anyone else.
Instead of relaying "realistic" and "precise" information by
standing at an open window and gazing at the picturesque
scenery from a fixed position, Iris visits all of James's win-
dows, with some broken, others barred, and all distorting
women's views. Iris's abodes, including the ancient Avilion
and contemporarily wrought house of her husband, Richard
Griffen, with their styles effected and manufactured, bring
her "pleasure," such as that about which she reads in
Coleridge's "Kubla Khan" as being a "pleasure-dome"
(Atwood, 2000, p. 333). Nonetheless, for Iris, the novel's sky
signifies a blue "dome" (p. 405) through which she cannot
escape, at least not in league with a male figure paralleling
the city of Sakiel-Norn's blind assassin from the novella and
Alex himself, one who might descend from the heavens on a
rope to rescue her, perhaps even as an elderly woman, but
never does, because female characters gaze at a proverbial
glass ceiling in the book. Still, when Laura asks questions
about Kubla Khan's magical landscape, Iris explains that she
is no schoolteacher to explain its significance, in juxtaposi-
tion to the girls' tutors, "Miss Violence" and Mr. Erskine,
who approach their academic subjects via romantic, mythical
idealizations imposing constraints on women as tight and
ridiculous as the antiquated corset.
Modernist and postmodernist writers introduce perfora-
tions into narrative perspective models providing greater
variation in the patterns that authors, including Atwood,
apply, as exemplified previously. Burkhard Niederhoff
(2011, n.p.) describes "intermediate cases, embeddings,
transgressions or unusual combinations" of points of view,
and other contemporary narratologists broaden perspective
discussions likewise by adding ideological, lingual, percep-
tual, and spatio-temporal factors to the calculation. Feminist
scholar Susan Lanser (1981) explains that "[u]nlike such tex-
tual elements as character, plot, or imagery, point of view is
essentially a relationship [between the seer and his or her
object] rather than a concrete entity" (p. 13). Casting Iris as a
seer possessing what Lanser calls a reciprocal "relationship"
with her patriarchally influenced objects of study involving a
system of their visual, lingual, and ideological co-assess-
ment, Atwood depicts Iris as a character studying her various
landscapes while declining to commit to any Jamesian win-
dow of sight, with features that limit women's storytelling
acts. For Iris, all "houses of fiction" in the novel function as
castles of some sort, providing not only lavish enjoyment
and protection but also the reality of imprisonment for
women in clouding their "clear" or unimpaired vantage
points. At her childhood residence, Avilion, a fortress left in
ruins, Iris languishes in her role as a princess; in Richard's
domain, an asylum similar to Laura's mental hospital that his
sister, Winifred, decorates, Iris hides away as Richard's wife;
in Alex's unsafe, minimalistic, and temporary hideouts, Iris,
his lover, must not be seen and cannot stay; and in Iris's own
Hembrough 5
small house, she secludes herself as an old witch and cannot
navigate the premises alone, such as by descending to the
dungeon-like basement to launder clothing. Then, there are
the intrusions of those caring for Iris, such as house servants
Reenie and Myra, tasked with protecting a castle's keep.
While Iris, stationed in each varying compound, peers out its
windows, others standing outside gaze in, too, calling atten-
tion to the postmodern consideration that Iris's vision and,
thus, her message to readers, wanting unrestricted access, is
mediated at all levels. According to Jacques Lacan
(1964/1978), discussing "the split between the eye and the
gaze," in contemporary landscapes, one may be aware of
being watched as much as of watching. Furthermore, Michel
Foucault (1975) offers a related incarceration-based theory
based on Jeremy Bentham's panopticon conceptualization,
in which a population's members are being watched poten-
tially at all times by an unseen eye and must decide how, if at
all, to modify their behavior under oppressive surveilling
mechanisms (pp. 195-210). Like Sakiel-Norn's male assas-
sin, arriving costumed as a female to kill but then save the
sacrificial maiden, Iris decides to modify her dress, attitude,
and posture for each of her distinctive settings, even as she
interrogates and fulfills the appropriate moment's role.
For Lanser and Wayne Booth, an author's gender, values,
and socioeconomic station all contribute to a text's perspec-
tive, and in discussing characters-as-writers, such as Iris,
including these components in point-of-view considerations
is important in evaluating her narratorial persona. In assess-
ing a story's perspective, Booth (1961/1983) urges readers to
consider the narrator's position as well as his or her psycho-
logical state and "privilege" regarding the place from which
he or she is providing information (pp. 160-163). Indeed,
some narrators boast having a more privileged location than
others that remain isolated, such as Iris, who finds herself on
the periphery, no matter her residence. Booth defines the
"unreliable narrator," one remaining at a distance from the
culture and exhibiting a disconnect with normative values, as
representing a child or an elderly person lacking full cogni-
tive capacities, one having a criminal background or hiding
the truth, and/or one possessing a psychologically impaired
mind-set. In addition to being a first-person-limited narrator,
Iris may fit each of Booth's unreliable-narrator categories,
depending on the lens one applies. First, Iris offers conflict-
ing accounts tied to her multiple subjectivities, either because
she possesses a schism in her subjectivity in psychoanalytic
terms, due to her performance of various conflicting wom-
en's roles, or because she wishes to hide her part in others'
calamitous outcomes, such as Laura's, as in a prototypical
detective piece narrated from the guilty party's perspective.
As a second qualifier for unreliability, Iris foregrounds her
memory-related and age-based health issues. As an octoge-
narian, Iris covers a time span of nearly a century in her nar-
rative, involving not only her own history but also that of
generations prior, and there exists a spatio-temporal divide
between her childhood and the present hour that raises
metaphysical questions about their exploration's nature. As a
last indicator for unreliability, Iris has never recovered from
the psychological effects wrought by her obsessive love
affair with Alex, which at many points makes her unstable.
As a female author, Iris is also fallible according to
Enlightenment-based ideologies silencing women's voices.
Atwood demonstrates that Iris's patriarchal milieu would not
have valued her work had she presented it for review, regard-
less of whether it comprised autobiographical or fictional
components and regardless of the style and format she
favored. Until Iris is writing as an elderly woman, she has not
considered offering her text to readers for consideration and
does not even name herself, prior to the end, as the novella's
author. In postmodern terms, Iris fulfills the unreliable, fal-
lible teller's role within her culture's masculinist constraints.
Nonetheless, Atwood assumes an arguably positive stance
toward Iris, a narrator exploring everything she sees but pro-
viding no clear picture of it to critique her patriarchal back-
drop. While James (1908/1972) expresses that narrators
should avoid presenting any moral component to a tale,
because the focalizer represents a "window" and "mirror"
reflecting society without judgment (p. 249), narratologist
Ansgar Nunning suggests that narrators' perspectives are
tied inescapably to their "psychological idiosyncrasies, atti-
tudes, [and] norms and values" (Nunning, 2001, p. 213).
Combining Realism with Postmodernism, Iris's tableau
includes not only James's "portrait of a lady," one such as the
aristocratic Isabel Archer, who must "affron[t] her destiny"
(James, 1881/1971, p. 12), but also that of the blind assassin:
a prostitute, miscreant, and an orphan.
Narrating From Within the House of
Fiction: A Room With No View
While Forster (1908) penned A Room With a View to indicate
the importance for the contemplative, upper-class protago-
nist, Lucy Honeychurch, of having a "view" in her travels,
and Virginia Woolf (1929/1989) proposed that the aspiring
female author needs "a room of one's own" in an essay of
that title, according to The Blind Assassin's postmodern out-
look, having a window does not grant one the means of sight
for women narrating their stories.
At Avilion: Iris as a Youth, Sister, and Cultural
Casualty
At the novel's outset, Iris posits herself, like Laura, as a casu-
alty of social strictures to gain readers'sympathy and present
herself as a likeable narrator-protagonist poised to fulfill the
book's heroic role, which traditional readers expect in
Chambers's reader/writer contract's terms. As a victim of
others' wrongdoings and failures, Iris grows up at Avilion,
named according to Adelia's Modernist, fairytale-founded,
Arcadian notions. In having Avilion constructed, Adelia may
have envisioned King Arthur's island from Tennyson's Idylls
6 SAGE Open
of the King, a narrative the girls read. As a protected location,
Tennyson's fantastical retreat does not suffer from Nature's
ravages, but the Chase estate, and Iris, as its inhabitant, is
less fortunate. When Iris is nine, Liliana, her mother, dies,
and when Iris reaches 18, her father, Norval, faces bank-
ruptcy in the 1930s depression. In the end, the Chase facto-
ries are disbanded. Reenie seeks another job and marries
after setting, like Iris's other female forbearers, a patriar-
chally inspired, if rebellious, example of women's suffering
and compliance in maintaining antiquated standards and
playing a wife to Norval and a mother to the girls. When
Norval dies, Iris and Laura must fend for themselves, and
Laura translates the maxim, "there's no place like home," to
mean that home cannot exist as a location for them (Atwood,
2000, p. 447). In the same passage, at a later time, Iris tells
herself that "[h]ome is where the heart is," but because, as an
aging woman, she has become "heartless," she is hence
"homeless" (p. 447). The novel offers the sisters no comfort-
ing place and no secure point-of-view in any known, mascu-
linist realm, whether earthly, heavenly, or mythical.
Nevertheless, the premise that Iris, being heartless and
homeless like Sakiel-Norn's blind assassins, possesses no
residence at Avilion, can allow her female descendants to
picture themselves elsewhere and anywhere.
Although Iris loses the Chase house representing her
inheritance, she does not feel comfortable there, especially
once Richard, its new owner via marriage, begins to revamp
it. Eventually, Avilion serves as an assisted-living facility
called "Valhalla," signifying a place of eternal feasting for
male warriors, such as Norval, an alcoholic wounded in an
overseas conflict pursued to defend the home front. This
home represents one that Iris, a veteran's daughter and not a
war hero herself, must leave. Nevertheless, Iris assumes that
smokers will burn down the house and destroy its history
associated with male-dominated, Victorian purposes.
Meanwhile, the button factory, of which Iris is dispossessed
similarly after it did catch fire, is salvaged and becomes a
tourist attraction, allowing onlookers to gaze upon the past
without experiencing it. Inside, Myra owns a souvenir shop
called the Gingerbread House, like that depicted in Hansel
and Gretel, where instead of hungry children, old ladies,
including Iris, feast upon art and history generated for con-
sumptive purposes, as if to memorialize themselves through
reminiscent fabrications of some ideal form. Like Iris evalu-
ating the yesteryear via simulations of its bric-a-brac, Derrida
(1976) presents a deconstruction-based theory posing a gap
between the signifier and signified, according to which, he
explains, a thing cannot resemble its name. Even the town
itself, named after a defeated battle hero, represents an
emblematic loss. Iris's masculinist-constructed, childhood
home was never hers in the first place. Shelley Boyd (2013)
compares The Blind Assassin and Shakespeare's King Lear,
and in both works, the daughters face their estates' destruc-
tion. King Lear represents a genre tragedy, with Goneril kill-
ing Regan and ending her own life, but Laura's end and Iris's
subsequent disappearance invite a reading of the scenario in
which Iris's heirs write open futures because of their king-
dom's forfeiture.
Analyzing her early years, Iris invokes herself as a pawn
moved around the board by characters embroiled in a mascu-
linist society, including her parents, even if this version of
herself, in postmodern terms, represents as much of a con-
struction as do the other characters' recordings. Still, Iris's
grandfather, Benjamin, who depicts the button factory's his-
tory in his gold-embossed book, and Adelia, who fashions
scrapbooks memorializing girls' debuts in elegant dresses,
imprint their identities upon Iris, regarding their texts as
quaint but curiously forceful. In the "Avilion" chapter, Iris
lists the miscellaneous objects that Laura finds in collecting
tokens on Avilion's uninhabited premises later on, as if Laura
is trying to locate pieces of a story concerning how the sisters
became victims of their male-invoked fate and how they
might save some treasure representing their "true" essence
with which to describe and value themselves. However,
many trifles that Laura recovers are associated with tradi-
tional female roles, and these items' displacement from their
locations within the Chase home is positive for Iris's descen-
dants'futures, which may place heirs beyond the household's
confines. In an interview, Atwood likens the novel genre's
form to a "capacious container" (Gussow, 2000, p. B7), and
here, it represents one that Iris attempts to fill with a past as
vast and random in matter as the memorabilia littering
Avilion's rooms. Amid The Blind Assassin's narrative's clut-
ter, readers wanting answers about Iris may pan for clues that
never surface, and despite her ruminations, Iris discovers that
"[i]t is no longer possible to know" the nature of her story's
elements, such as the terms of her parents' relationship spe-
cific to World War I (Atwood, 2000, p. 72). Although this
lack of knowledge on readers' parts could lead to a failure of
Iris's narrative in Chambers's transactional terms, Atwood
implies that leaving women's questions unresolved provides
them with the benefit of their retaining no permanent, invia-
ble answers.
At Richard's Palace and Alex's Rooms: Iris as a
Wife, Mistress, and Social Product
Avilion's dining-room's stained-glass windows, picturing
the tragic fairytale lovers, Iseult and Tristan, offer Iris a col-
ored, romantic world receding from view as she becomes an
adult with a classical bent that she foregrounds in her narra-
tive to challenge depictions of her victimization and posit
herself as her masculinist culture's product. Still, in leaving
Avilion, Iris enters houses with clear, glass windowpanes
transparent in nature but no less opaque for women's pur-
poses of viewing their worlds. Having failed in business,
Norval, who married a woman of his choice, urges Iris to tie
herself to Richard, an older business associate she hardly
knows. The Chase patriarch sacrifices Iris to save his pride,
if not his legacy, in terms of the mansion and factory.
Hembrough 7
Likewise, in Alex's parallel saga on Planet Zycron, set 8,000
years before, power shifts are ever present: The rising aris-
tocracy threatens the ruling class, and men treat women
abjectly, from the sacrificial maidens to the king's mistress
herself, who he plans to sell into slavery, because "every-
thing was for sale," in the city's epicenter (p. 28). In Luce
Irigaray's (1998) Marxist-based theory concerning women's
objectification and marketplace commodification, men
exchange women, who are displayed for social consumption,
as commodities: In a male-dominated culture, mothers hold
a use value, virgins an exchange value, and prostitutes pos-
sess both. Similarly, during the novel, Iris, first as a virgin
and then as a wife and mother, fulfills, in Irigaray's terms,
her "value" as a social product.
If marrying Richard makes Iris, barely an adult, a victim,
she also represents an outcome of culturally enacted norms,
as she considers her fate, as well as that of her father, sister,
Reenie, and the button-factory workers, in reviewing her
options as a woman facing displacement and replacement
within male-centered realms. As a female character, Iris is
defined, according to Judith Butler's theory of gender con-
ceptions, not only by sex but also by socioeconomic status,
ethnicity, and other identity aspects comprising gender, an
ideation formulated by social strictures as opposed to being
generated by personhood (Butler, 2004). Yet, like Sakiel-
Norn's virgins, singing about "absence and silence" (Atwood,
2000, p. 29), the king's mistress, requesting courtship-inspired
poems that he fails to pen, and perhaps even the king's wife,
mentioned only briefly, as if she possesses no desires, Iris dis-
covers that the noble gesture of self-sacrifice she offers in
becoming a wife is meaningless to everyone involved, includ-
ing her family, community, and Richard. When Laura tints
Iris's wedding photos, making them appear hyperreal, Iris is
upset that her pictures, serving as "clues and evidence" for
her story, according to Barzilai (2010, p. 156), are ruined.
Nevertheless, despite her position as a social product, Iris
cannot "recall having been present" at the ceremony at all
(Atwood, 2000, p. 239) to memorialize its function or signify
her compliance with her role as Richard's wife. Betty Friedan
(1963) depicts the emptiness that Iris encounters as a house-
wife during this era as "the problem that has no name"; for
Friedan, the "silent question" that housewives were asking
themselves concerning their state was, "`Is this all?'" (p. 15).
In The Blind Assassin, Iris as a wife searches for something
else, too, if locating no new function for herself that might
crystallize forms for female heirs.
When Iris moves to Richard's house, a refurbished, con-
temporary palace of his choosing and purchase, Iris is no less
ready to call this space her own. The Griffen abode, decorated
in pearly shades, prefigures Laura's Bella Vista hospital room,
and its sanitized, airy, heavenly nature is no more freeing
than Iris's ancestors' heavy, ornamented fortress rendered as
Valhalla in Norse mythology. Even as wallpaper patterns and
paint colors change with the era, for Iris, the roles for women
and the windows out of which they gaze at their prospects do
not. Indeed, Iris mentions that the Griffen garden, a landscape
women before her must have observed similarly while impris-
oned in the bedroom, remains unaltered. When Iris designs its
plot, she discovers she has no plans for it, because her person
has been co-opted systematically by those making every deci-
sion for her, from clothing choices to grooming practices.
Winifred, both decorating Richard's palace and bedecking
Iris's body as temples, might appear at any time, as if Winifred
does not possess her own space either, and under Winifred's
influence, Iris is expected, like an expensive piece of furni-
ture, to bear the weight of a masculinist regime wishing her to
be gracious, dependent, submissive, and virginal. Feeling her-
self "erased, featureless, like an oval of used soap, or the
moon on its wane" (Atwood, 2000, p. 235), Iris retreats to the
bathroom, a room without windows, first prior to her wedding
night, then on her honeymoon, and at the Griffen abode,
because her view is blocked at every angle by Richard, the
new king, or his sister, the High Priestess in the Sakiel-Norn
allegory. Although Richard requires Iris for the bedroom's
sexual pleasures, she remains peripheral to him, while
Winifred, roaming the premises, is "necessary" (p. 331).
Nevertheless, in the novel, writing and secretion practices
offer a means for women to gain subjectivity (Ku, 2004), and
in advancing age, Iris, visiting the donut shop's bathroom,
aligns washroom writing acts with composing messages to
other occupants sharing this private space for urination and
defecation. Because the messages presented, representing
scribbles, lack clear meaning, women may interpret them
however they want, validating their perspective decisions,
whatever these may be.
As Richard's romantic partner, Iris finds that her marriage
transaction goes unrecorded in "official" historical accounts,
such as the one that Benjamin offers in his leather-bound
book relaying economic success. Gothic literature focuses on
the motifs of what Gina Wisker (2012) calls "pursuit, terror,
power, and the potential of real rape" (pp. 51-52), and Iris's
and Richard's union represents what Wisker might deem a
"tale of conformity and hidden abuse" (2012, p. 134). Just as
Iris, maintained in one masculinist stronghold or another,
stays indoors mostly and looks out windows at what lies
beyond, her suffering in marriage is not only veiled from
public view but also exists as an acceptable version of the
contract itself, a context precluding Iris from fashioning her-
self simply as a martyr. Still, in Butler's (2004) theory of
gender as involving a performative act allowing one to func-
tion within social boundaries, Iris cannot signify her gender
and lay claim to any value supposedly associated with it, for
better or worse, despite her entrenchment in the book's vary-
ing locations linked to traditional female functions. While
Iris's fate in marriage is perhaps no worse than that of
Laura's, who Richard sends to a mental institution for refus-
ing the place he fashions for her, a bedroom festooned in
pink, Laura becomes a saint for her later supposed suicide,
while Iris, in old age, is left as the town's recluse. Of the
sisters, Laura represents the more independent, stubborn, and
8 SAGE Open
giving character, attempting to avoid the patriarchal Griffen
landscape by escaping on the train and providing for herself
by working at a fair. There, Laura makes the donuts of which
Iris finds herself to be the center, absent of features. Iris nei-
ther aligns herself with the sacrificial maiden's role, nor does
she become the predatory opportunist Winifred plays, either.
Avoiding these dualisms as exemplary of her lineage's
options, Iris invokes and mimics both offices in turn.
Nonetheless, Richard, a foil to the Chase men and sweat-
shop tycoon, compensates Iris, an aristocratic wife, with new
money. As a social product, Iris benefits from the "sale" of
her person via what Irigaray (1998) describes as the market
exchange's terms, ones not unlike Chambers's reader/writer
contract in which both parties possess obligations and
expect returns. While Laura colors Richard's photograph
green to indicate his financial appetites, and green signifies
Benjamin's book's shade, Iris also conforms to her newest
part, having acting lessons, clothes, and makeup, along with
the house Richard purchases to replace the one she left,
which, "out of sight," is also "out of mind" for her until
Norval dies, Laura phones, and Iris reconsiders her alliances.
Having given herself over to outward appearances like the
Chase and Griffen houses to be remodeled, Iris dresses styl-
ishly and applies potions to soften her hands and brighten her
face. Simone Beauvior (1997), discussing women's concep-
tions, argues that "[t]he social significance of the toilette
allows woman to express, by her way of dressing, her atti-
tude toward society. If she is submissive to the established
order, she will assume a discreet and stylish personality" (p.
547). In their storytelling,Alex compares Iris, who he implies
is a "pampered society bride," to Sakiel-Norn's sacrificial
virgins: Both ceremoniously "fulfill [their] duties with deco-
rum" (Atwood, 2000, pp. 29, 28), as if their actions represent
temple-residence rites, and as a new wife, Iris is seduced by
the popular culture depicted in women's magazines to mirror
its modes. Capitalism engineers one's gender and thus one's
story, and, according to Isabel Carrera (1994), Iris represents
not only a product but also a consumer who consumes.
Following matriarchal leads dictated by patriarchal codes,
Iris, a cultural product, acts as a hostess, housewife, and,
eventually, mother at Richard's palace. Iris represents a rich,
nominally educated socialite, yet, to her credit, in postmod-
ern terms, she remains unrefined and unimpressed by her
surrounding system of patriarchal enterprise and industry. At
the Chase home, Iris had confused original masterpieces
with fabricated classics, and she possesses no relationship
with the museums, buildings, and high-culture artifacts
Richard dispatches her to see for educational purposes on
their honeymoon. Both Irigaray (1985), describing women
as the "sex which is not one," and Cixous (1975), calling for
women to implement écriture féminine, founded on the origi-
nal relationship that women, as language teachers, possess
with their children, posit that in a patriarchally inscribed uni-
verse, women are constructed by numerous forces, least of
all themselves. Yet, in "actuality," Iris possesses no real
"self" at all to assert as a female character contained in mas-
culinist spaces. Iris's only escape lies in tending a rock-filled
garden, a barren landscape, where she holds no responsibility
to nurture anything living, from the perspective of her cul-
ture's fatherly origins, back to the primordial Garden of
Eden. Still, stones may roll, and Sakiel-Norn's vanished peo-
ple could live beneath their city's rubble. Years later,
Richard's house with its "squinty" windows (Atwood, 2000,
p. 295), from which Iris, as a wife, had difficulty seeing,
boasts a broken, second-floor pane allowing for the possible
departure, one Iris herself never made, of some female
resident.
Richard's house serves as Iris's prison, and she walks
about town, enters shops, and attends movies to escape it,
even though she is subject to male purview in these public
areas. Iris cannot express her "self" in Alex's changing series
of rooms either, because there she assumes an identity as his
mistress while retaining her function as Richard's wife. Iris
does not possess her own place, and there is no location
where she might meet Alex on "free" ground in some alter-
nate space that she and Alex, as storytellers, might invent
together to empower men and women equally. Indeed,
Zycron's inhabitants of an alternate universe later people
Earth. Having fled Richard's palace, Iris hides in Alex's
hovel-like sanctuaries, located often on the town's wrong
side but offering furnishings that seem offputtingly similar to
Iris, if of lesser quality, like the shoes worn by the street's
women exhibiting their perambulation's value and nature.
The narratives that the lovers tell to release themselves of the
tedium and duress of their affair's constraints become barri-
ers demarcating their respective gender roles, and Iris real-
izes that there is little difference between her marriage to
Richard and liaison with Alex, men dedicated to their given
occupations and not to her. Alex, both like Richard and the
alien creature Alex himself invents for his stories, "love[s]"
Iris by attempting to "assimilate her" into himself (p. 279),
and while Iris resists Alex's mission to possess her, she never
escapes his gravitational pull, one as strong and bright as the
Apollonian sun of masculinist truth in Nietzsche's
(1886/2008) war between Apollonian and Dionysian forces.
While Alex signifies his own milieu's outcome, Iris repre-
sents his mistress and a prostitute, according to her jokes and
Irigaray's (1998) portrayal of women's use values, with pros-
titutes having both male exchange and use purposes. As in
being paired with Richard, Iris remains contained within the
same patriarchal strictures.
In the novella, the maiden trusts the assassin to lead her
from the castle, even though outside the city gates, there lies
as much danger as within. Yet, Iris is unable to abandon her
comfortable metropolitan lifestyle, and neither does Alex
wish to take Iris with him to an open, foreign country. Like
"Kubla Khan's" lover, Alex, whose name means "to aid," is
absent when needed. Meanwhile, similar to Adelia, Iris pos-
sesses "no money of her own" (Atwood, 2000, p. 60),
because everything belongs to Richard via marriage, and Iris
Hembrough 9
is unwilling to get a paying job herself. Indeed, as a waitress,
a role Laura suggested for the two sisters, Iris's obligation
would be to serve all men, instead of a handful. Before
departing for Spain, Alex asks Iris to leave Richard and his
house, but she declines. In reply, Alex decides that if Iris
were to get a room, he would obsess about other men pos-
sessing her through their gaze instead of him or Richard. No
matter where Iris travels in her contemporary world, she
remains a captive of some masculinist-created stronghold,
whileAlex, slipping among apartments to avoid detection for
his Communist leanings, the tenor of which remains murky,
is less impeded. When Alex flees to Spain, his fate remains
open. Iris expects his reappearance until receiving the tele-
gram, which does not provide the confirmation of his death
that a body's return would. It is easy for Alex as a younger
aged male to vanish, his corporal form missing, yet the
elderly Iris imagines death via heart failure as the path to
freedom from the patriarchally sewn cloaks that she has
donned and exchanged as so many costumes.
Before news of Alex's death, Iris imagined getting an
apartment with her daughter, Aimee, above a grocer's store
to await Alex, and, once, Iris dreams that he or his semblance
appears at her tower-like residence of an unknown location,
where she considers sneaking out of the bedroom window to
meet him but does not want to "fall" (Atwood, 2000, p. 468).
Iris does not want to drop into the night or, later, tumble
alone into her cellar as an aging woman facing the end,
although, in this state, women's possibilities for journeys
might present themselves more openly, Atwood suggests, as
one enters a state of mental darkness, and the "self" disinte-
grates. Both sisters live with Richard while setting their
sights on Alex, and the romantic Laura dies when she loses
Alex, while Iris, steeped in classicism, pines in old age. Like
Iseult, Laura assumedly commits suicide, and Iris decon-
structs her "self" as a woman alone in her tomb-like house.
In the book, Iris resides in various tower-like structures
sheltering but imprisoning her. The mythical Rapunzel
makes herself accessible to male rescuers, yet Iris does not
offer any hand in her escape, because she foresees having
nowhere to go. In The Blind Assassin, Iris is rendered a zero,
a space defined by absence, the scooped-out egg. She acts as
the indefinable male obsession: Alex "invents[s]" and
"makes[s] her up" as with his stories' characters (Atwood,
2000, p. 276). Still, Iris's lack of subjectivity provides her
and her lineage with options: Even as Iris contemplates being
with Alex, she hopes to forget her name, to black out and
float in space, as "[s]he render[s] herself up, is blotted out"
(Atwood, 2000, p. 261). Iris, spinning tales with Alex, has
wished for happy endings, yet she will not receive one her-
self, because reaching foregone conclusions involves writing
stories that then have been told. When Alex argues that all
stories terminate with wolves, Iris refuses to agree with him.
Instead, claiming that there are other endings without specu-
lating about their essence, she leaves her descendants' fates
open to unfold as they will.
At an Unspecified Location: Iris as (Not) a
Mother and Villain
On her honeymoon, Iris, without foreknowledge, stays at a
hotel later associated with Paris's Nazi headquarters.
Moreover, she describes Richard as a fascist. However, com-
posing a self-narrative, Iris also writes of "her struggle" from
her jail-cell-as-small-house to inspire future generations to
remember her. From the beginning, Iris acknowledges her
significance not only as a casualty and product of her mascu-
linist system but also a villain in its terms. Nonetheless, psy-
choanalyst Jessica Benjamin (1998) describes a scenario
involving "the bonds of love" in which all parties in a liaison
are complicit in adhering to and recapitulating acts of domi-
nation because they do not recognize them as such: Even
when parties espouse equality and personal autonomy, they
may apply a set of dominating strategies with sexual partners,
family members, and community relations. Still, Iris raises
questions of where to draw the line between being compliant
to and forming an alliance with the Griffens once she believes
Richard had been raping Laura. With Iris's professed inability
to protect Laura, if also herself and later Aimee, Iris flees
Richard's palace. Iris cannot abscond to Alex's rooms now
that he is gone, nor return to the Chase mansion, never refur-
bished, even though Laura admits to having lived there after
Bella Vista. When Iris leaves Richard, an unacceptable act for
a woman of her stature and purposed grounds, because
Laura's novella is unpublished, and Richard remains above
suspicion, Atwood places Iris in no notable space at all.
Although victorious, Iris remains vague concerning her
downgraded living circumstances, which she has detailed in
excess, down to the items she packs in her suitcase to travel
from one residence to another in earlier periods, such as with
her honeymoon. Iris provides no clear timeline demarcating
her new independence, even though she has referenced his-
torical events as backdrops anchoring her spatio-temporally
to prior scenes, such as World War I, either.
As a woman with a small house but someone without a
known social residence, Iris represents an outlaw without
refuge, even though she pits Richard as the novel's darker
force. Although Iris's location remains remote, if her own,
during Aimee's early childhood, Iris does not skip town and
the masculinist constraints and figures associated with it.
Indeed, Winifred, with legal support, seizes Aimee subse-
quent to Iris leaving her home territory and sharing a bed
with an unnamed man at a hotel in a maneuver placing her,
as both a mother and so-called prostitute, beyond masculine
use values in Irigaray's market-exchange theory. In the
novel, Iris does not represent the traditional mother figure
taking steadfast care of her wards; she critiques Liliana,
rejects the matriarchal part with Laura, watches her daughter
be removed, and finds herself barred from involvement with
Sabrina. Nevertheless, because Iris both reaches out to her
granddaughter through writing but avoids assuming an
overly directive tact toward her in prototypical terms, Iris,
10 SAGE Open
who might be called a villain in masculinist terms, allows
descendants to depict a mother's role in broader strictures or
refuse it totally.
At the Small House: Iris as a Writer, Assassin,
and an Avenger
Regardless of the years' passage, Iris's cottage, like
Coleridge's pleasure dome, retains its masculinist structure
providing limited sightlines for women. Yet, it is at Iris's lit-
tle house where she assumes a writer's personality to address
Laura's case as well as her own. In The Blind Assassin, as
with William Faulkner's (1936) novel, Absalom, Absalom!,
readers must assemble the book's events and assign blame
for family members' misfortunes spanning multiple genera-
tions. Reading represents a decoding act, but Faulkner's nar-
rative's structure, like Atwood's, remains one of mirrors and
endless reflections. After The Blind Assassin's digressions
and detours, readers return to its puzzle concerning Laura's
death presented in the first sentence. Where did Laura go,
and why? The mystery as to whether Laura committed sui-
cide and, if so, who is to blame remains unsolved, to Iris's
benefit, detriment, and sense of affected removal from the
so-called crime scene. In Atwood's Alias Grace (Atwood,
1996), a novel with a similar theme portraying a female char-
acter involved with criminal circumstances, readers never
learn whether Grace Marks is guilty of the murders of her
employer and his housekeeper/mistress either. Grace, like
Iris, represents both a "villain" and a "victim" (Cooke, 1998,
p. 325), and Atwood's (1979) novel, Life Before Man, is con-
cerned similarly with the narrator's former lover's suicide
and the corresponding nature of the couple's involvement.
Iris's name derives from the eye's black-hole center, signify-
ing an expanse beyond mapped locations, and in her varied
settings, Iris portrays herself as a victim, product, and villain.
Now, as a writer-as-blind-assassin, Iris will avenge her
female line. In keeping secrets, representing logocentrically
constructed knowledge gaps, and telling lies, signifying dis-
placements of masculinist truths, Iris chooses a middle
ground for herself, never accepting nor defying any one self-
characterization. Iris's ability to, as Butler (2004) puts it, per-
form and "trouble" her gender allows her to play diverging
roles supporting and undermining women's stances.
In The Blind Assassin, a postmodern narrative about
someone constructing a narrative, Iris assumes her function
as a writer-killer undertaking the task of character assassina-
tion to dispel singularly defined female constructs. Indeed,
as a writer, Iris is intent on, if unable and even unwilling to,
understand and convey Laura's persona. Iris remarks that
Laura possesses the same traits as the average person, except
that Laura refuses to hide her essence, a feature that Iris finds
"frighten[ing]" to others (Atwood, 2000, p. 89). Also, Iris is
jealous of her alter-ego, who utilizes Iris's property, from her
nail file, hairbrush, and car to the white gloves that Laura
wears to her death to nullify any fingerprints associated with
her location, one now beyond the pale. By the conclusion,
the sisters are conflated, so that any damage Iris does in
affecting Laura's death, Iris renders to herself. Iris represents
her sister's maker and savior but also her grim reaper, and
Iris creates and removes many of the book's agents, includ-
ing Laura, from their hegemonic settings to free them from
the masculinist lines of which they cannot break loose them-
selves. Ultimately, Iris believes that she does not own the "I"
in her name in the manner that Laura wields the "L" (p. 88),
because everyone possesses an "I" with which to tell one's
story. Yet, Iris's name's expansiveness leads her to become
an avenger of women and a leader at their forefront's cause,
whatever that might be.
Like many of Atwood's novels, The Blind Assassin deals
with social strictures, whether women accept these stan-
dards, and how they will be judged if refusing to comply.
Often, Atwood's female characters face bleak futures and
view themselves as having fractured identities (Deery, 1997,
p. 4). However, Iris, grappling with multiple subjectivities
and choosing none, is empowered, not dysfunctional, in her
fluctuating state. Iris contemplates Laura as another version
of her "self," and Atwood presents comparisons between the
protagonist and female family members, such as Liliana and
Winifred, too, propelling Iris to contemplate her personali-
ty's set of fissures based on these outliers. Besides likening
herself to family, Iris divides herself still further upon seeing
women, who she resembles, walking the street, too. The
breaches in Iris's semblance allow her to represent a large,
diverse female sphere as opposed to rendering her a casualty
in terms of Lacan's (1985) mirror stage theory, in which peo-
ple are damaged, if left enlightened, upon discovering their
subjectivity. McWilliams (2007, p. 30) finds that Atwood's
"novel is fundamentally concerned with the idea of selfhood
as a narrative construction or invention", and as an octoge-
narian, Iris posits herself as being "perfect" and in her prime
(Atwood, 2000, p. 311), because she has tried on every self
available to female characters but assumed no single cast.
Beryl Donaldson-Langer (1981, p. 91) argues that The Blind
Assassin possesses an "absence of viable role models".
Nevertheless, this lack of inspiring prototypes renders Iris
free of the masculinist-constructed identities for women that
she attempts, deconstructs, and finally explodes in the book.
Many ofAtwood's (1969) novels, such as The Edible Woman,
invoke a society demanding that women choose between
marriage and having a career, yet as a widow and writer, Iris
assumes both of these roles, along with others, and problem-
atizes each via its appropriate locale.
In reliving her past, Iris believes that she is gaining insight
into her affairs. However, Iris also reveals her "wish to con-
ceal," one common to others holding secret knowledge of
their backgrounds. Then, she admits that what she has writ-
ten is "wrong"; the "truth" is missing, because Iris's message
represents "a voice outside the window" (Atwood, 2000, pp.
448, 395). Alternately, Iris confesses that she is buried alive
in the so-called information she has amassed. As a writer
exploring and judging her past and Atwood's novel's pro-
tagonist, Iris represents a "remembering self" recalling her
Hembrough 11
"historical self" as she veers between "self-reproach and the
desire to justify or vindicate herself" (Robinson, 2006, n.p.).
Nonetheless, Iris's compiling of logocentric knowledge
leaves her speechless and confused, because, as a female
writer, she both lacks information concerning women's
affairs, reproducible in feminine lights, and possesses it in
excess. Iris represents an unreliable, fallible narrator, unable
to assemble the "full" details of Laura's death. Hence, in tra-
ditional terms, Iris's culpability in Laura's tragedy is blunted
and diffused. Nonetheless, with her position as protagonist-
narrator decentered, Iris resigns any claim to male-enacted
legitimacy and Socratic-based insight. In the face of readers'
expectations for the novel genre, Iris offers no singular secret
to be revealed and no one case to make. Instead, as a writer-
assassin, she builds and destroys the book's characters,
including herself, morphing from the young princess in the
castle to the aging witch in the gingerbread house to render
women's possibilities open.
Iris as a Vanished Writer: The
Conclusion and Beginning
Because The Blind Assassin possesses discontinuous narra-
tives and multiple viewpoints, Iris cannot create a
Modernistic, totalistic effect for her story and so tell a defin-
itive and perhaps redeeming story about herself for which
readers, once satisfied, may acquit her of her failings. The
diverse facets of Iris's character, linked with Atwood's
book's structure, may affect her believability and likeability
as a storyteller for readers choosing to view her as a custom-
ary narrator. Instead, Atwood forces audience members to
reconsider their "normative" reading practices in light of the
book's narrative perspective and forms. While Iris repre-
sents a narrator with a first-person-limited, fallible view, a
female character marginalized by socioeconomic and fam-
ily-related circumstances, in postmodern terms, all first-
person narrators become "unreliable" and untrustworthy.
Possessing a faulty memory and shifting views, as a blind
killer, Iris dispels any meaning she creates and posits no one
account. In commencing the writing of her book, Iris states
that she has no audience in mind and that "[t]hings written
down can" be "harm[ful]" (Atwood, 2000, p. 287), but it is
only through the destruction of gender norms that Iris's line
may generate beginnings. In the novella, the maiden escapes
her city before the truth about her absence can be discov-
ered, while Iris hides her authorship from town residents.
The maiden's secret brings destruction to Sakiel-Norn, and
Iris's tale causes Richard's downfall, even his death, as well
as the loss of her daughter and social position. Despite
enacting their own personal and cultural tragedies, the
maiden and Iris face fates unknown and undescribed. At
first, Iris does not imagine her readers, but later she admits
her wish to make her book available to Myra and Sabrina.
Iris hopes to avenge herself and Laura through an act of
writing, signifying "a commemoration of wounds endured
. . . and resented" (Atwood, 2000, p. 508). Nonetheless, to
avoid affixing potential readers, such as Sabrina, with iden-
tities solidified in masculinist terms, Iris avoids imagining
Sabrina's future life after envisioning her entering the door
for their first meeting.
By leaving Iris's identity and The Blind Assassin's tenor
open ended, Atwood creates a living story for women where
nothing is finalized, and later, the unnamed editor and artist
can gather up and strew Iris's collected works throughout the
novel as a pastiche representing Iris's bright, jagged "[s]
hards" invoking a place called "home" (Atwood, 2000, p.
57). In assisting Laura to enact her fate, Iris kills and sends
her sister to a different and perhaps superior location beyond
the page before traveling there herself. While Hamlet was
afraid of entering the "unknown country," Atwood implies
that to affect changes for women, characters such as Iris must
enter open spaces to expand the options of those remaining
in the living world. Looking at the picnic photograph, Iris
remarks,
The picture is of happiness, the story not. Happiness is a garden
walled with glass: there's no way in or out. In Paradise there are
no stories, because there are no journeys. It's loss and regret and
misery and yearning that drive the story forward, along its
twisted road. (Atwood, 2000, p. 518)
For an assassin, killing is amoral. It is simply one's job. The
novel's blind assassins, like Iris, are orphans and pickpock-
ets, without parents and without traditional strictures. In
James's terms, writers portray what they see, but in postmod-
ern terms, they may also depict what they do not see. The
writer-assassin is blind because she does not know how her
new location's landscape will appear. The Blind Assassin
may both frustrate readers and give them their money's
worth in terms of its plot twists and turns, with its secret and
promise being that the ending is open.
