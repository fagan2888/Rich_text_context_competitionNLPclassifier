background: This study explores the current patterns of reproductive health service use among young women in the USA and the
changing influence of socio-demographic factors on the types of services used over time.
methods: The study population, drawn from the two last cycles of the National Survey of Family Growth, consists of women aged
15­24 (n ¼ 2543 in 1995, n ¼ 2157 in 2002). We examined trends in use of `contraceptive services' and `other reproductive health services
for preventive care' and tested for changes in the patterns of use of these services over time. Logistic regression models were used to further
clarify the factors associated with the use of the two types of services in 2002.
results: Results show no difference in the overall use of reproductive health services in the past year but did reveal changes in the type of
service sought. Use of services for contraception increased by 10 percentage points (39.3% in 1995 to 49.7% in 2002, P , 0.001), although
the use of other services remained stable (53.2% in 1995, 50.2% in 2002, P ¼ 0.14). The patterns of use varied over time, exhibiting growing
social disparities. In 2002, the use of contraceptive services depended on women's age, number of partners, personal and mother's level
of education, and menstrual problems. The use of other reproductive health services for preventive care varied across women's socio-
economic background.
conclusion: This study demonstrates increasing social differentials in the use of reproductive health services for preventive care among
young women in the USA between 1995 and 2002, a finding which calls for careful monitoring in the context of limited resources.

Introduction
Between 1995 and 2002, the teen pregnancy rate in the USA fell sig-
nificantly, establishing a record low rate for the 1976­2002 period
(Ventura et al., 2006). Most teen pregnancies in the USA are unin-
tended and due to a combination of contraceptive nonuse and contra-
ceptive failure (Manlove et al., 2004). The association between poor
contraceptive use and teen pregnancy is supported by studies demon-
strating that improved use of contraception played a key role in redu-
cing teen pregnancy risk during the 1990s (Santelli et al., 2007).
However, despite the encouraging trend toward fewer teen pregnan-
cies, a summary of health services used by teen women published by
the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy reveals that over
half of women aged 15­19 did not access any reproductive health
care in the year preceding the 2002 survey (Suellentrop et al.,
2008). If these women are at risk for pregnancy, it follows that
there is an unmet need for reproductive health care among young
women in the USA.
A recent analysis of sexual and reproductive health service use
among US women of reproductive age (15­44) shows that,
whereas overall use of sexual and reproductive health care services
remained constant between 1995 and 2002, use of contraceptive ser-
vices sharply rose over the same period of time, especially among the
youngest women (Frost, 2008). On the basis of these results, we seek

to explore how socio-demographic factors are associated with
preventive reproductive health care service use in the USA and to
understand the changing influence of such factors over time. We
expand our population to include women less than 25 years old, as
they account for half of all abortions performed in the USA (Guttma-
cher Institute, 2008) and half of all sexually transmitted infections
(Weinstock et al., 2004); the proportion of pregnancies that are unin-
tended is also highest in this age group (Finer and Henshaw, 2006).
We control for sexual experience in this analysis, with the understand-
ing that not all young women have the same reproductive health
needs.
Our study also looks at factors associated with the types of repro-
ductive health services obtained by young women. Results of the 1995
and 2002 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) surveys indicate
that publicly-funded family planning clinics are more likely to provide
contraceptive counseling and STD testing and treatment to women
than private providers are (Frost, 2001, 2008). However, between
1995 and 2002, there was a decrease in the number of publicly-funded
clinics receiving Medicare funding. In 2003, fewer family planning clinics
provided free reproductive health care services to adolescents than in
1999 (Lindberg et al., 2006). Although the data suggest an overall
increase in contraceptive service use over this period, women
across the USA may not have equally participated in this increase in
service use. Thus, in this context of resource vulnerability and
reduced provision of family planning services to the poorest teens,
we analyze the distribution of reproductive health services for preven-
tive care obtained by women aged 15­24 who participated in the
2002 NSFG survey.
Materials and Methods
The data for this study were obtained from the 1995 and 2002 cycles of
the NSFG, a population-based survey conducted by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics
to provide national data on contraception, infertility, sexuality and health
of men and women in the USA (Lepkowski et al., 2006). For both the
1995 and 2002 cycles, data were collected from an area probability
sample representing the household population of the USA, 15­44 years
of age. In-person interviews were conducted in the homes of 10 847
women in 1995 and 7643 women in 2002, with over-sampling of Black
and Hispanic women. The response rate was 80%. The interviews were
voluntary and confidential. The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Panel for Human Subjects at Princeton University.
For the purposes of this study, we restricted the population analyzed to
women between the ages of 15 and 24. We analyzed data only from
women who were not currently pregnant and who had not received pre-
natal or post-natal care in the past year, as we hypothesized that repro-
ductive health service use by women who were either pregnant or had
recently given birth would be disproportionately greater than that of the
general population. With these restrictions, our study population was
2523 in 1995 and 2157 in 2002.
In the first part of the analysis, we compare 1995 and 2002 overall
reproductive health service use in the last 12 months for all women
15­24. We then stratify the results by sexual activity status (`ever had
sex' and `never had sex') and further explore changes over time by focus-
ing on the use of reproductive health services for preventive care, which
we divided into two categories: `contraceptive services' and `other preven-
tive reproductive health services.' Contraceptive services include consul-
tation, prescription and/or counseling for birth control (including
sterilization). In addition, women in the 2002 survey were also asked if
they had received a prescription or counseling for emergency contracep-
tion. Only 11 of the 156 women who received emergency contraception
services did not report other contraceptive service use. These women
represent 0.3% of the total population receiving contraceptive services.
Other reproductive health services for preventive care include pap
smears, pelvic exams and STI testing or treatment (excluding HIV
testing and treatment). The NSFG questionnaire did not allow for the dis-
tinction between STI treatment and STI testing. It was not possible to
determine the category of reproductive health services used by
73 women in 1995: 41 of them only described having received an HIV
test (which may have been performed in a non-reproductive health care
setting) and 32 denied receiving any of the 13 types of reproductive
health services examined in the 1995 survey. In addition, 52 women
described having used abortion services only (n ¼ 6), or having only
received a pregnancy test (n ¼ 48). These women as well as the
73 described above were considered to have received services other
than preventive care services.
In the second part of the analysis, we compare the determinants of con-
traceptive service use and other reproductive health preventive care
service use in 1995 and 2002, stratifying by sexual activity status (ever
had sex and never had sex). We test for changes in the patterns of
health care use over time. Finally, as we identified different determinants
of preventive care use in 1995 and 2002, indicating that patterns of
health care use changed over time, we present a multivariate analysis
for determinants of the use of the two types of preventive reproductive
health services (contraceptive and other services) for the most recent
year 2002. The multivariate models included all variables for which
P-values were 0.25 or lower in the univariate analysis. All analyses were
performed using logistic regression models. Changes in the patterns of
health care use were tested by introducing an interaction term between
the survey year in the factors associated with the use of services. The ana-
lyses were performed using Stata 10 SE (Stata Corporation, College
Station, TX, USA). Data are weighted to account for the complex
sampling design of the NSFG surveys (unequal probabilities of being
included in the survey). The numbers shown in the tables are unweighted,
but the percentages are weighted.
Results
We found no difference in the overall use of reproductive health ser-
vices in the preceding calendar year between 1995 and 2002, nor in
the use of these services for preventive care only (Table I) In both
survey years, most women used a combination of preventive care ser-
vices during the 12 months preceding the survey. Thus, among women
who received at least one preventive care service, 11% received con-
traceptive services alone, 23% received other preventive care services
alone and 66% received both. When stratifying use of reproductive
health services by women's sexual activity status, we found a 4.8%
point increase in the use of preventive care services (including contra-
ceptive services, STI testing/treatment, pap smear and pelvic exam)
among women who had ever had sex. Results also indicate that
between 1995 and 2002, women reported differences in the type of
preventive services sought. There was a 10% point increase in use
of contraceptive services, although there was no difference in other
reproductive health service use for preventive care between 1995
and 2002 (Table II). More women received contraception (44%
versus 37%, P ¼ 0.003), contraceptive counseling (27% versus 20%,
P , 0.0001), pelvic exams (61% versus 55%, P ¼ 0.003) and testing
or treatment for STIs (16% versus 10%, P , 0.0001) in 2002 than in

1995. Conversely, the same proportion reported having had a pap
smear (47% in 1995 and 2002, P ¼ 0.97). Among women who had
never been sexually active, 13.7% reported having had a pap smear
in the preceding 12 months (13.4% in 1995 and 13.9% in 2002) and
1.4% were tested/treated for STIs (0.6% in 1995 and 2.2% in 2002).
The increase in service use for contraception between 1995 and
2002 has not benefited all women equally (Table III). For sexually
active women, those who were less educated, foreign born, uninsured
at some point during the year, or daughters of less educated mothers
were less likely to have increased their use of services for contracep-
tion in 2002. Conversely, the youngest women experienced a greater
increase in their use of contraceptive services than did their older
counterparts. Among women who had never had sex, the only differ-
ence in the patterns of contraceptive service use by year of survey per-
tained to the area of residence: residents from suburban metropolitan
areas were less likely to exhibit an increase in family planning service
use in 2002 than were others.
Although there was no overall increase in the use of other repro-
ductive health services for preventive care between 1995 and 2002,

there were changes in the patterns of use of these services over this
period (Table IV). Results show a decrease in use of these other pre-
ventive care services among socially-disadvantaged young women who
had previously had sex, including those who were foreign born, unem-
ployed or not in the labor force/school, uninsured at some point
during the previous year, or had less educated mothers. Conversely,
there tended to be an increase in the use of these services among
the youngest age group of women. Among women who had never
had sex, there was a significant decrease in (non-contraceptive)
preventive service use among women who were less educated,

unemployed or not in the labor force/school and who reported
having menstruation or ovulation problems.
In the multivariate analysis of determinants of contraceptive service
use in 2002, we found that use of these services by women who were
sexually experienced depended on age, number of partners, country
of birth, personal level of education, mother's level of education and
problems with menstruation or ovulation (Table V). Only the last
factor was associated with contraceptive service use among women
who had never had sex.
The second multivariate model analyzing factors associated with
other preventive reproductive health service use in 2002 shows that
the use of these services among those who were sexually experienced
varied according to women's socioeconomic background. In particu-
lar, women not in the labor force/school were less likely to report
using these services in the previous 12 months. The same was true
for women who were less educated or had less educated mothers.
Conversely, women with at least one sexual partner in the last
12 months and black women were more likely to have sought these
services in the last year. Among women who had never had sex
older age, higher level of education, and reporting difficulty with men-
struation or ovulation were all predictive of service use (Table VI).
Discussion
This study shows that between 1995 and 2002, the overall stability of
reproductive health service use among young women in the USA con-
ceals widening socioeconomic disparities in use of these services.
Although the study shows a 10% point average increase in the use
of services for contraception, young women of low socioeconomic
status enjoyed smaller increases in use of these services. These
growing social differentials are even more striking when it comes to
other reproductive health services for preventive care (pelvic
exams, pap smears, STD testing/treatment). Use of these services
has remained stable on average; however, it has sharply declined
among the socially disadvantaged, including women who were
foreign born and lacking insurance coverage. In a recent analysis of
reproductive health service use by type of provider in the USA
between 1995 and 2002, Jennifer Frost shows that the rise in contra-
ceptive service use among women of reproductive age (15­44) is
almost entirely due to an increase in contraceptive care received by
women visiting private doctors. In contrast, she shows the delivery
of contraceptive services by other providers has remained unchanged
(Frost, 2008). These findings may partly explain why contraceptive
service use has mostly improved among the most advantaged young
women but has stagnated among others.
Our results suggest that disparate use of reproductive services for
preventive care is rooted in social inequalities, perhaps more pro-
nounced in 2002 than in 1995. These results are consistent with the
conclusions of a recent report expressing concern over the lack of
improvement in contraceptive use among poor women in the USA.
This plateau comes after a period of continuous improvement in contra-
ceptive use following the passage of Title X of the Public Health Service
Act in 1970, legislation enacted to provide publicly subsidized family
planning (Boonstra, 2008). There was a 4% increase in contraceptive
non-use among women at risk of an unintended pregnancy between
1995 and 2002 (Chandra et al., 2005), and a larger increase among
women with lower education and lower income (Boonstra, 2008). In
a representative sample of US women at risk for unintended pregnancy
interviewed in 2004, Frost and colleagues found that less educated
women were only a third as likely to use any form of contraception
as those who had a college degree (Frost et al., 2007). They also
found a greater risk of not using contraception among women who
reported having no healthcare provider. Such disparities ultimately
widen the socioeconomic gap among women experiencing unintended
pregnancy. In a similar vein, Finer and Henshaw show that between
1994 and 2001, the rate of unintended pregnancy declined among ado-
lescents, college graduates and the wealthiest women but increased
among poor and less educated women (Finer and Henshaw, 2006).
Interestingly, we found that lack of health insurance, often cited as a
culprit in deterring use of prescription contraceptive methods, was
not significantly associated with contraceptive service use, after control-
ling for other socio-economic factors (Culwell and Feinglass, 2007).
Improving reproductive healthcare coverage for women in the USA is
an essential step towards reducing social inequalities (Ranji et al.,
2007), but this alone is unlikely to close the gap. Indeed, as Boonstra
argues in an analysis of government program impact on reproductive
health inequalities, targeted initiatives have limited impact in solving
the multidimensional cause of these disparities.

Reproductive health service use among young women 3015
In contrast to many studies, our results show greater use of contra-
ceptive services among the youngest women. These results indicate
that sexual activity accounts for much of the reported difference in
healthcare utilization among teens. Therefore, this study suggests
improvement in sexually active teens' use of reproductive health
care services over this period. This finding is also consistent with
the increase in contraceptive use and the decline in unintended preg-
nancy rates among teens between 1994 and 2001 (Finer and
Henshaw, 2006; Santelli et al., 2007).
Finally, we found no significant differences in the use of other repro-
ductive health services for preventive care by area of residence. These
results however, need further investigation to take into account the
role of contextual factors (such as the availability of publicly-funded
reproductive health services) on the use of reproductive health ser-
vices in the USA.
Conclusion
This study reveals growing socio-economic disparities in the use of
reproductive healthcare services for preventive care among young
women in the USA between 1995 and 2002. In a context of resource
vulnerability, it is essential to recognize the nature and extent of these
disparities, and promote reproductive health policies aimed at addres-
sing these social inequalities, which are likely to expand in the current
era of economic unrest.
