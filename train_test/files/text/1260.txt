Objectives: The national seroprevalence of the nononcogenic hu-
man papillomavirus (HPV) type 11, one of the types targeted by the
quadrivalent HPV vaccine, has not been evaluated in the United
States. The objectives of this study were to estimate the national
seroprevalence and evaluate predictors of HPV-11 seropositivity.
Study Design: We tested serum samples for HPV-11 antibodies
and analyzed questionnaire data from the second phase of the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, 1991­1994.
Seroprevalence estimates were weighted to represent the US pop-
ulation.
Results: Overall seroprevalence of HPV-11 infection was 4.7%.
Seroprevalence was significantly higher among females (5.7%) than
among males (3.6%). Independent predictors of HPV-11 seropositivity
included sex, race/ethnicity, lifetime number of sex partners, educa-
tion, and HPV-16 seropositivity.
Conclusion: This study represents the most comprehensive picture
of HPV-11 infection in the United States to date, and provides baseline
data on the prevalence of HPV-11 before availability of the quadriva-
lent HPV vaccine.
HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUSES (HPVs) are a heterogeneous
group of nonenveloped DNA viruses that infect the skin and
mucous membranes of human hosts. To date, at least 100 geneti-
cally distinct HPV types have been identified, over 40 of which
infect the genital areas.1 HPV infection is ubiquitous, and genital
HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the
United States.2,3 However, quantifying the prevalence of genital
HPVs nationally has been difficult because the majority of HPV
infections are asymptomatic4­6 and most infections clear within 2
years of infection.7,8 Although not all infected individuals develop
detectable levels of antibodies to HPV, serologic measurements
can be used to evaluate cumulative exposure to HPV at the
population level.8,9
The global incidence and prevalence of oncogenic HPV types
have been well described in several studies, mostly in the
context of cervical cancer, over 70% of which is associated with
HPV types 16 and 18,1,8,10 but also in seroprevalence studies,
including a population-based investigation of HPV-16 sero-
prevalence in the United States.9,11­18 Less is known about the
seroepidemiology of nononcogenic HPV types 6 and 11, which
together are responsible for over 90% of anogenital warts
worldwide.4 ­ 6,19 ­21 HPV types 6 and 11 are also detected in
nearly all cases of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), a
rare but life-threatening disease,18,21­23 and are responsible for
the majority of nononcogenic HPV-related morbidity and asso-
ciated health care costs.24 ­28 Data on the proportional distribu-
tion of types 6 and 11 in genital warts as well as RRP are
limited because many studies used methods that did not distin-
guish between these 2 closely related types that occur with high
prevalence in both conditions. Data from a few investigations
have demonstrated that HPV-11 accounts for 8­30% of genital
warts worldwide.19,29 ­31 In the juvenile-onset form of RRP, in
which vertical transmission from infected mother to child is the
suspected mode of transmission,21­23,32 HPV-11 has been asso-
ciated with a more aggressive clinical course.23
A prophylactic HPV vaccine directed against HPV types 6,
11, 16, and 18 has been shown in clinical trials to have high
efficacy in females for prevention of infections and clinical
outcomes due to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18.33,34 This quadrivalent
vaccine was approved by the FDA in June 2006 for use in
young women between the ages of 9 and 26 years.33 If appro-
priately implemented, the current recommendation to routinely
vaccinate 11- to 12-year-old adolescent girls35 could have a
substantial impact on vaccine type HPV-related clinical out-
comes.
The objective of this study was to determine the seropreva-
lence of HPV-11 infection in the general US population of ages
6 to 59 years. Additionally, the study aimed to describe patterns
of HPV-11 seropositivity, and presumably infection, in various
subpopulations and to characterize associated risk factors. Re-
sults were obtained from a national seroepidemiologic survey of
HPV-11 infection performed on surplus serum samples from the
second phase of the third National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES III), conducted from 1991 to 1994.

Materials and Methods
Study Population and Design
NHANES are cross-sectional national surveys conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, conducted as period surveys until 1994
and redesigned as a continuous annual survey since 1999.
NHANES are designed to provide national estimates on the health
and nutritional status of the US civilian noninstitutionalized pop-
ulation. Consenting participants have household interviews and
physical examinations and phlebotomy in mobile examination
centers. The surveys use a stratified multistage probability cluster
design to select a representative sample of the US civilian nonin-
stitutionalized population aged 2 months or older in 50 states.
NHANES III was conducted from 1988 to 1994 in two 3-year
phases. Children aged 5, adults aged 60, Mexican Americans,
and non-Hispanic African Americans were sampled at a higher
rate compared to other demographic groups to allow sufficient
sizes for analysis of the groups. Poverty index was calculated
according to the US Census definition by dividing total family
income by the poverty threshold after adjusting for family size at
the time of interview. Persons residing in a county in a metropol-
itan area were classified as "urban" while all others were defined
as "nonurban." Limited sexual history information was asked of
adolescents aged 15 to 16 years while respondents aged 17 to 59
years provided more detailed sexual behavior information. Use of
alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana was asked of all participants 12
years. Response rates for 1988­1994 NHANES III were 86% for
the household interview and 79% for the medical examination and
have been described in detail elsewhere.36
The following analysis is limited to the second phase of
NHANES III conducted from 1991 to 1994. Of the persons 6 to 59
years were selected to participate; 9542 were interviewed, 8933
(94%) of whom also received a health examination. Surplus serum
samples were available for 8102 participants, which comprised
85% of the total interviewed and 91% of those examined.
Laboratory Methods
We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to
detect HPV-11 IgG antibodies in serum samples. Viruslike parti-
cles (VLPs) were produced by expression of an HPV-11 L1
recombinant baculovirus in insect cells (gift from Dr. Robert Rose,

SEROEPIDEMIOLOGY OF HPV TYPE 11 IN THE UNITED STATES
University of Rochester, NY).37 Purification of VLPs was per-
formed as previously described.9 A direct VLP ELISA was per-
formed with sera at 1:20 dilution, standardized and performed as
described elsewhere.9,38 For quality control and evaluation, we
screened anonymized human serum samples for reactivity to HPV
11 using 25% blocking of a mouse polyclonal antibody to HPV-11
VLP as indicator of positivity. These sera were then used as
individual high positive and negative controls and also to prepare
pools of high positive, low positive, and negative serum controls to
standardize the ELISA. Five individual controls and 3 pooled
controls were used on each plate. Quality control assessment
included monitor of day-to-day and plate-to-plate variation using
Levy-Jennings plots. Results for individual control serum samples
that were run throughout the course of the NHANES III analysis
were used in receiver operating characteristic analysis to determine
the ELISA cutoff value for discrimination between positive and
negative samples.
Statistical Analysis
SUDAAN software version 9.0 was used for all statistical
analyses to incorporate the sampling weights and account for
the nonrandom cluster design in calculating the variance esti-
mates based on a Taylor series approximation. All seropreva-
lence estimates were weighted to represent the total US civilian
noninstitutionalized population and to account for oversam-
pling and nonresponse to the household interview and physical
examination. We estimated HPV-11 seroprevalence overall and
by various demographic categories. Bivariate significance tests
for association were based on a Wald 2 statistic. The confi-
dence intervals for the prevalence estimates were calculated on
the basis of the log transformation with standard errors of the
log prevalence calculated using the  method.39 Critical values
used for the confidence intervals were based on the t-distribu-
tion with the degrees of freedom as number of strata minus the
number of primary sampling units, which in most cases was a
total of 23 degrees of freedom. No adjustments for multiple
comparisons were made to P values.
The association of age with HPV-11 was examined in bivariate
logistic regression with age as a 6-level categorical variable (6­11,
12­19, 19­29, 30­39, 40­49, and 50­59). Plot of age category
midpoints versus the  coefficients of that category from the
models showed a nonlinear association in both sexes. We inves-
tigated the presence of an upward linear trend in females less than
39 years old and a downward linear trend among females older
than 40 years, using age as a continuous variable in separate
logistic regression models as suggested by the data. Likewise, we
examined presence of an increasing linear trend in males up to 49
years. A trend was considered statistically significant if the 
coefficient of age in the model was nonzero at P 0.05 using the
Satterthwaite adjusted F test.
We used logistic regression analysis to identify independent
predictors of HPV-11 seropositivity in participants 17 to 59 years
old.40 Any variable with a statistically significant Wald 2 statistic
at P  0.10 on bivariate analysis was included in the initial
models. Age was modeled as a continuous variable and evaluated
for the possibility of a nonlinear association with HPV-11 sero-
prevalence. Using a backward elimination strategy, parameters
determined to be statistically significant with the Satterthwaite
adjusted F-test P  0.05 were retained in the main effects model.
Data-based confounding was assessed for variables that were
dropped in the backwards elimination steps. If a dropped variable
was responsible for a change of 20% in the  parameter estimate
of the main effects variables, the variable was retained in the
model to adjust for confounding irrespective of statistical signifi-
cance. Finally, all pairwise interactions between variables in the
final model after assessing for confounding were evaluated. Pair-
wise interactions significant with a Satterthwaite adjusted F-test
P  0.05 were retained.
Results
Based on 8102 persons tested between 1991 and 1994, the
overall seroprevalence of HPV-11 among persons 6 to 59 years in
the United States was 4.7% (95% CI: 3.9­5.6). Seroprevalence
was significantly higher in female (5.7%) than in male participants
(3.6%) overall (P  0.04) and remained higher in females across
all age and race categories (Table 1). Overall, HPV-11 seropreva-
lence was highest among females in the 30- to 39-year age group
(6.3%), whereas it peaked among males in the 40- to 49-year age
group (5.7%). There was a significant increasing trend in sero-
prevalence for females 6 to 39 years and males 6 to 49 years
followed by nonsignificant declines through age 59 in both males
and females (Fig. 1). Seroprevalence also differed significantly by
self-identified racial category. Overall, prevalence was highest
among non-Hispanic African Americans (8.8%), more than double
the prevalence in Mexican Americans (4.3%) and non-Hispanic
whites (3.8%). A similar proportional trend was observed among
racial categories when stratified by sex with African Americans

having high rates of infection in both males and females. The
prevalence of HPV-11 was much higher in African American
females (12.6%) than African American males (4.5%). Geographic
analysis of seropositivity did not reveal any regional differences.
However, urban residents were significantly more likely to be
seropositive (5.7%) than those living in nonurban areas (3.7%)
nationwide, particularly among males. The overall seroprevalence
of HPV-11 was significantly higher among people living below
poverty level (6.6%) compared to those living at or above poverty
(4.3%) and the trend remained the same when stratified by sex.
HPV-16 seropositivity was also significantly associated with
HPV-11 seropositivity and the pattern was the same in both males
and females. Overall, a total of 171 participants tested positive for
both infections, which represents 1.2% of the entire population
(95% CI: 0.9­1.7), 1.7% of females (95% CI: 1.1­2.5), and 0.75%
of males (95% CI: 0.4­1.3) (P  0.02). Among those infected
with HPV-11, 26.3% were also seropositive for HPV-16 (95% CI:
19.4­35.6).
Behavioral characteristics significantly associated with HPV-11
seropositivity included age at first sexual intercourse, lifetime
number of sexual partners, and ever use of cocaine and marijuana
(Table 2). Five male and 10 female respondents with no reported
history of sexual intercourse were found to be HPV-11 seroposi-
tive. Almost all (n  14) of these 15 individuals were also
seropositive for another sexually transmitted infection, herpes sim-
plex virus 2 (HSV-2). One female was of missing HSV-2 status
and could not be evaluated. The seroepidemiology of HSV-2 in
this population has been described in detail elsewhere.41
In the multiple logistic regression model, statistically signif-
icant predictors of HPV-11 infection included female gender,
African American race, increasing number of lifetime sexual
partners, less than high school education, and HPV-16 coinfec-

tion (Table 3). Urban residence and drug use did not remain
significant in the final model. Socioeconomic status as mea-
sured by living below or above the poverty level marginally
confounded the association between HPV-11 and race, but the
difference was not statistically significant and did not affect any
of the estimates. Therefore, poverty level was not included in
the model. We found no other confounding or effect modifica-
tion, and thus no other variables were included in the model.
Discussion
This study is the first to describe the seroprevalence and distri-
bution of HPV-11 infection in the United States. Our results
indicate that the odds of HPV-11 seropositivity were over 2 times
higher among females compared to males. This observed sex
difference is not surprising given inherent immunologic and ana-
tomical differences between males and females that are well
known to result in differential susceptibility to most sexually
transmitted infections.42 Results of a study of genital warts among
NHANES participants from 1999 to 2004 by Dinh et al. indicate
that "women were three times more likely to report having a
history of genital warts than men," supporting our findings.43
Moreover, seroprevalences of other genital HPVs have also been
reported to be significantly higher in females compared to
males.9,44 In contrast to our findings, anogenital warts24,26 have
been reported to have similar sex distributions. However, the
results from this study are not directly comparable to the reported
prevalence of anogenital warts, particularly data derived from
genital warts claims submitted by privately insured patients who
may not be representative of the general US population. Our
results indicate that HPV-11 seroprevalence is much higher in both
male and female non-Hispanic African Americans, a racial cate-
gory that is likely underrepresented in the insurance claim data.
Although our data suggest that the prevalence of HPV-11 is only
slightly lower among people who reported never having sex com-
pared to those who reported ever having sex (4.4% vs. 5.5%,
respectively), these results must be interpreted with caution. Only
15 respondents seropositive for HPV-11 reported never having had
sex. This small number leads to an unstable and therefore unin-
terpretable estimate. Moreover, upon closer examination of the 15
respondents, we found that at least 14 were herpes simplex virus
type 2 seropositive. Presence of 2 different sexually transmitted
infections in this group may be an indication that the respondents
either did not understand the sexual history questions or did not

There was a significant trend for increasing HPV-11 seropreva-
lence up to 39 years of age in females and 49 years in males.
Thereafter, HPV-11 appeared to decline although the downward
trend was not found to be significant. This observed pattern sug-
gests that the risk of HPV-11 infection begins as a person becomes
sexually active and increases through the third decade in females
and the fourth decade in males, after which it appears to gradually
decline. Although we did not find significant decreases in sero-
prevalence in either males or females, the observed decrease may
either represent a cohort effect such that older persons may have
been less likely to be exposed to HPV-11 or a loss of antibodies to
the virus over time.
As expected, we found the overall prevalence of HPV-11 (4.7%)
to be lower than that previously reported for HPV-16 in the same
population (13%).9 However, results of this study suggest that
HPV-11 is a common sexually transmitted infection.
Other factors that were found to be independently associated
with HPV-11 in the current study include nonwhite race (espe-
cially non-Hispanic African American race) and number of life-
time sex partners. About the latter, the data indicate that HPV-11
seroprevalence increases commensurate with increasing number of
lifetime sex partners.
This study has some limitations. First, sexual behavior and
other risk factors are self-reported and thus subject to reporting
bias, including underreporting of risk factors. Second, use of
serologic testing may underestimate infection with HPV-11
given the low rate of seroconversion after natural infection. In
addition, while type-specific VLPs were used in the ELISA,
cross-reactivity between closely related types, particularly
HPV-6, cannot be excluded. Despite limitations, however, se-
rology is currently the best approach to ascertaining exposure in
the population. Finally, due to lack of HPV-6 VLPs required for
testing specimens, we were unable to evaluate the seropreva-
lence of HPV-6 in this population.
The results of this study represent the most comprehensive
picture of HPV-11 infection in the United States to date. Impor-
tantly, this study provides baseline data on the prevalence of
HPV-11 before availability of a prophylactic vaccine against HPV
6, 11, 16, and 18, thereby allowing better assessment and evalu-
ation of the impact of this vaccine on this common infection.
