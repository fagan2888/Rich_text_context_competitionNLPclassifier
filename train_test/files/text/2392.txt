in Youth After Detention
A Prospective Longitudinal Study
Linda A. Teplin, PhD; Leah J. Welty, PhD; Karen M. Abram, PhD; Mina K. Dulcan, MD; Jason J. Washburn, PhD
Context: Psychiatric disorders are prevalent among in-
carcerated juveniles. Most juveniles eventually return to
their communities, where they become the responsibil-
ity of the community mental health system. However, no
large-scale study has examined psychiatric disorders af-
ter youth leave detention.
Objective: To examine changes in the prevalence and
persistence of psychiatric disorders during the 5 years af-
ter detention, focusing on sex and racial/ethnic differ-
ences.
Design: Prospective longitudinal study with up to 5 in-
terviews (1829 youth: 1172 males and 657 females). To
ensure representation of key demographic subgroups, the
randomly selected sample was stratified by sex, race/
ethnicity (African American, non-Hispanic white, and His-
panic), age, and legal status (juvenile or adult court).
Setting: The Northwestern Juvenile Project, sampling
youth from the Cook County Juvenile Temporary De-
tention Center, Chicago, Illinois.
Participants: Detained youth, aged 10 to 18 years at base-
line interview.
Main Outcome Measures: At baseline, the Diagnos-
tic Interview Schedule for Children Version 2.3. At fol-
low-up interviews, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for
ChildrenVersionIV(ChildandYoungAdultversions)and
the Diagnostic Interview Schedule Version IV (substance
use disorders and antisocial personality disorder).
Results: Five years after baseline, more than 45% of males
and nearly 30% of females had 1 or more psychiatric dis-
orders with associated impairment. More than 50% of
males and more than 40% of females had 1 or more psy-
chiatric disorders without impairment. Substance use dis-
orders were the most common; males, however, had
higher rates over time (5 years after baseline, adjusted
odds ratio [AOR], 2.61; 95% CI, 1.96-3.47). Non-
Hispanic whites and Hispanics also had higher rates of
substance use disorders vs African Americans (AOR, 1.96;
95% CI, 1.54-2.49 and AOR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.24-2.03).
Females had higher rates of major depression over time
(AOR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.22-2.08).
Conclusions: Although prevalence rates of most psy-
chiatric disorders declined as youth aged, a substantial
proportion of delinquent youth continue to have disor-
ders. There are notable sex and racial/ethnic differences
in the prevalence and persistence of psychiatric disor-
ders in this population.

PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS ARE
prevalent among incarcer-
ated juveniles.1-14 A 2008 lit-
erature review14 concluded
that psychiatric disorders are
substantially more common in adoles-
cents in detention than among adoles-
cents in the general population. The North-
western Juvenile Project15 found that at
intake to detention, even after excluding
conduct disorder, more than 60% of juve-
nile detainees met diagnostic criteria with
diagnosis-specificimpairmentfor1ormore
psychiatric disorders. Among youth incar-
cerated for 9 months, Karnik et al16 found
evenhigherrates:approximately90%ofde-
taineeshadapsychiatricdisorderotherthan
conduct disorder or oppositional defiant
disorder. Using the lower rate,15 more than
55 000 of the 92 854 youth held in US cor-
rectionalfacilitieseachday17 have1ormore
psychiatric disorders.
Many psychiatric disorders are likely to
persist as these juveniles become young
adults. Risk factors for psychiatric disor-
ders are common among delinquent youth:
maltreatment,18-20 dysfunctional fami-
lies,19,21 family substance abuse,18 and brain
injury.22 Because delinquent youth have
few protective factors to offset these risks,
many are vulnerable to continued psychi-
atric morbidity as they age.18

Despite their importance, few longitudinal studies have
examinedtheprevalenceandpersistenceofpsychiatricdis-
orders after youth leave detention. Instead, studies23-26 of
delinquent youth have focused on the association be-
tween psychiatric disorders and criminal recidivism, an-
tisocial behavior, or social functioning. We could find only
one longitudinal study of the persistence and prevalence
of psychiatric disorders in detained youth. Harrington et
al27 found that 2 years after detention, many mental health
problems persisted or had worsened. Their sample, how-
ever, excluded females, was 80% white, and was too small
(N=97) to permit detailed analyses. Moreover, the study
was conducted in the United Kingdom, limiting general-
izability to juvenile detainees in the United States.
The related literature--longitudinal studies of "high-
risk" youth--also provides little information. Youth with
histories of detention have been included in studies of
high-risk youth: the homeless,28,29 youth living in im-
poverished or high-crime neighborhoods,30-34 and the off-
spring of parents who used substances or had psychiat-
ric disorders.29,35-46 Yet, none of these studies distinguished
between youth with and without histories of detention
(summary tables available on request).
Delinquent youth are also underrepresented in general
population longitudinal studies, such as household-based
surveys (eg, Great Smoky Mountains Study of Youth,47,48
National Comorbidity Surveys,49-51 and National Epide-
miologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions52) and
studiesdrawnfromschool-basedsamples(eg,OregonAdo-
lescentDepressionProject53,54 andPittsburghYouthStudy55)
and general pediatric clinics.56,57 Household surveys typi-
cally exclude persons in correctional institutions.47,50,58-61
School-based samples omit youth who are truant or miss
school because they are detained.53-55,62-65 Samples drawn
from general pediatric clinics omit youth who do not re-
ceive medical care.56,57 Even if sampled initially, youth may
belosttofollow-upwhentheyareincarceratedbecausethey
cannot be found and because studying prisoners requires
special procedures and approvals from the Secretary of
Health and Human Services.66
In sum, to our knowledge, no large-scale longitudi-
nal study has examined the prevalence and persistence
of psychiatric disorders after youth leave detention. This
omission is critical. Juvenile detainees have a median
length of stay of only 2 weeks.67 Thus, juvenile detain-
ees become a community public health problem when
they are released and may continue to burden society as
they age. Epidemiologic studies are the first step to im-
prove prevention and treatment in correctional facili-
ties and in the community.68 Data are also needed to ad-
dress health disparities, a priority of Healthy People 202069
and the Institute of Medicine.70 Of the approximately one-
half million incarcerated youth and young adults (aged
24 years or younger), nearly two-thirds are African Ameri-
can or Hispanic,17,71 compared with one-third in the gen-
eral population.72
This study presents data from the Northwestern Ju-
venile Project, the first comprehensive longitudinal study
of psychiatric disorders in youth after they leave deten-
tion. The sample is large (N=1829), racially/ethnically
diverse, and includes males and females. We examined
changes in the prevalence and persistence of disorders
during the first 5 years after detention, focusing on sex
and racial/ethnic differences.
METHODS
SAMPLE AND PROCEDURES
Baseline Interviews
We recruited a stratified random sample of 1829 youth at in-
take to the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Cen-
ter (CCJTDC) in Chicago, Illinois, between November 20, 1995,
and June 14, 1998. The CCJTDC is used for pretrial detention
and for offenders sentenced for fewer than 30 days. To ensure
adequate representation of key subgroups, we stratified our
sample by sex, race/ethnicity (African American, non-
Hispanic white, Hispanic, or other), age (10-13 years or 14-18
years), and legal status (processed in juvenile or adult court).
Final sampling fractions for strata ranged from 0.11 to 0.69.
All detainees who were awaiting the adjudication or dispo-
sition of their case were eligible to participate in the study.
Among these, 2275 detainees were randomly selected; 4.2% (34
youth and 62 parents or guardians) refused to participate. There
were no significant differences in refusal rates by sex, race/
ethnicity, or age. Twenty-seven youth left the detention cen-
ter before an interview could be scheduled; 312 left CCJTDC
while we attempted to locate their caretakers for consent. Eleven
others were excluded from the sample because they were un-
able to complete the interview. The final sample size was 1829:
1172 males and 657 females; 1005 African Americans, 296 non-
Hispanic whites, 524 Hispanics, and 4 other race/ethnicity; and
age range, 10 to 18 years (mean, 14.9 years; median, 15 years)
(eTable 1; http://www.archgenpsychiatry.com). Face-to-face
structured interviews were conducted at the detention center
in a private area, most within 2 days of intake.
Follow-up Interviews
Our design included (1) follow-up interviews at 3 and 41/2 years
after baseline for the entire sample and (2) 2 additional inter-
views at 31/2 and 4 years after baseline for a random subsample
of 997 individuals (600 males and 397 females). For each follow-
up, we interviewed participants regardless of where they were
living: in the community (approximately two-thirds of inter-
views), at correctional facilities (nearly 30% of interviews), or
by telephone if they lived more than 2 hours away (5% of
interviews).
Participants were paid $25 for the 2- to 3-hour baseline in-
terview and $50 for each of the 3- to 4-hour follow-up inter-
views. Most interviewers had graduate degrees in psychology
or an associated field and had experience interviewing at-risk
youth; one-third were fluent in Spanish. All interviewers were
trained for at least 1 month. For each wave, consistency across
interviewers was established and maintained via scripted mock
interviews after training and midwave. Additional informa-
tion on our methods is in the eMethods and is also published
elsewhere.15,73,74
Procedures to Obtain Assent and Consent
at Baseline and Follow-up
For all interviews, participants signed either an assent form (if
they were aged 18 years) or a consent form (if they were
aged 18 years). The Northwestern University Institutional
Review Board and the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention Institutional Review Board approved all study proce-

dures and waived parental consent for persons younger than
18 years, consistent with federal regulations regarding re-
search with minimal risk.75 We nevertheless attempted to
contact parents of minors to obtain their consent and to pro-
vide them with information on the study and used an inde-
pendent participant advocate to represent the minors' inter-
ests75 (eMethods).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Baseline
We used the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Ver-
sion 2.3 (DISC-2.3),76,77 the most recent English and Spanish
versions then available. This version of the DISC, based on the
DSM-III-R, assesses the presence of disorders in the past 6
months. The DISC-2.3 is highly structured, contains detailed
symptom probes, has acceptable reliability and validity, and re-
quires relatively brief training.76,78-81 Because the DISC-2.3 did
not include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we used the
module from the DISC-IV when it became available, 13 months
after the study began.73 Additional detail on baseline diagnos-
tic decisions can be found elsewhere.15,73,74
Follow-up Interviews
We administered the DISC-IV (Child and Young Adult ver-
sions), based on the DSM-IV, to assess for schizophrenia, mood
disorders, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity dis-
order, and disruptive behavior disorders in the past year.82,83
Impairment was defined as moderate impairment in at least one
area of functioning (criterion A).84 To facilitate comparison with
studies that do not impose impairment criteria, we present preva-
lence rates of disorders with and without the impairment cri-
terion; our analyses of changes in disorders over time use dis-
orders with impairment.
To assess substance use disorders and antisocial personal-
ity disorder at follow-up, we administered the Diagnostic In-
terview Schedule Version IV (DIS-IV).85,86 We used the DIS-IV
to assess substance use disorders because the DISC-IV is not
sufficiently detailed for our population. Antisocial personality
disorder was assessed for participants 18 years or older (who
were no longer eligible for diagnoses of childhood disruptive
behavior disorders). Disorders are assessed for the year before
the interview. Consistent with the National Comorbidity Sur-
vey Replication (NCS-R),50 participants who met the criteria
for substance use disorder or antisocial personality disorder with
"partial recovery" were scored as having the disorder. We did
not implement DSM exclusionary criteria.
Comparability of Diagnoses Over Time
Our diagnostic measures changed over time for 3 reasons:
(1) the release of the DISC-IV (based on DSM-IV criteria) mid-
study, (2) some participants turned 18 years old and were there-
fore ineligible for childhood disruptive behavior disorders, and
(3) our need to use a more comprehensive measure of sub-
stance use disorder (DIS-IV) for the follow-up interviews.
To check that changes in prevalence rates over time were
not the result of changes in measurement, we conducted sen-
sitivity analyses. We created a set of adjusted scoring algo-
rithms to maximize comparability among the DISC-2.3,
DISC-IV, and DIS-IV criteria while minimizing alterations
(Author's Appendix [http://hdl.handle.net/2166/repo
/teplin-0001]). All analyses were conducted twice, with and with-
out these adjusted criteria. Because there were no substantive
differences in findings and to enable comparisons with other
studies, we present the results using the original, unadjusted
diagnoses.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Prevalence Rates of Disorder
at Specific Times
Because some participants were interviewed more often than
others, we used a subset of interviews to summarize preva-
lence rates at 3 time points: baseline (time 0), time 1, and
time 2.
Time 1. Time 1 is the first follow-up interview but excludes
interviews that occurred more than 18 months after the inter-
view due date. Using a narrower window would restrict the gen-
eralizability of our findings because, in this high-risk and highly
mobile population, participants can be difficult to track. The
median time between baseline and time 1 was 3.0 years (mean
[SD], 3.2 [0.3] years; range, 2.7-4.5 years). For simplicity, we
refer to the time 1 interview as occurring approximately 3 years
after baseline. As reported in eTable 1, which summarizes sample
demographics and retention rates, 90.7% of the participants had
a time 1 interview.
Time 2. For each participant, time 2 consists of the earliest fol-
low-up interview that occurred approximately 4.5 years after
baseline. As with time 1, we excluded interviews that oc-
curred more than 18 months after this due date. The median
time between baseline and the time 2 interview was 4.7 years
(mean [SD], 4.9 [0.4] years; range, 4.3-6.0 years). To ensure
that prevalence rates reflect temporally distinct cross-sections
of the sample, we required at least 16 months between the time
1 and time 2 interviews. We subsequently refer to the time 2
interviews as occurring approximately 5 years after baseline.
As reported in eTable 1, 85.3% of participants had a time 2
interview.
To generate prevalence rates that reflect CCJTDC's popu-
lation, each participant was assigned a sampling weight aug-
mented with a nonresponse adjustment to account for miss-
ing data.87 Taylor series linearization was used to estimate
standard errors.88,89
Changes in Prevalence Over Time
We used all available interviews, with an average of 3.9 inter-
views per person (range, 1-5 interviews per person); 88.7% of
the participants completed all scheduled interviews. Using gen-
eralized estimating equations (GEEs),90 we fit marginal mod-
els examining (1) differences in the prevalence of disorders by
sex and race/ethnicity over time and (2) changes in disorders
as the youth aged. Disorder was modeled as binomial with a
logit link function. We used a robust sandwich estimator with
an unstructured correlation matrix; in the few instances in which
models failed to converge, we specified an exchangeable cor-
relation structure. All statistically significant (P.05) odds ra-
tios contrasting sex and racial/ethnic differences are noted and
were determined using GEEs. Unless otherwise noted, these
odds ratios contrast sex and race/ethnicity over time. Only 2
sets of odds ratios--those examining persistence of disorders
and those examining prevalence of disorders among partici-
pants living in the community--contrast sex and race/
ethnicity at single time points (time 1 or time 2). These were
estimated using logistic regression.
All GEE models included covariates for sex, race/ethnicity
(African American, Hispanic, or non-Hispanic white), and ag-
ing (time since baseline). We also included age at baseline (10-18

years) and legal status at detention (processed in juvenile or
adult court) because they were stratification characteristics. The
4 participants who identified themselves as other race/
ethnicity at baseline were excluded. We estimated models with
quadratic terms for aging when the linear term was statisti-
cally significant. When main effects were significant, we esti-
mated models with the corresponding interaction terms. Only
interaction terms or quadratic aging terms that reached statis-
tical significance were included in the final models. For mod-
els with significant interactions between sex and aging, we re-
port model-based odds ratios for sex differences at 3 and 5 years
after baseline. The GEE models were estimated with sampling
weights to account for study design. We examined the sensi-
tivity of our models to attrition by using weights that com-
bined the probability of being sampled with the probability of
dropping out.91 Results (available on request) were substan-
tially similar.
The GEE analyses were conducted on disorders (with the
impairmentcriterion)exceptfor(1)schizophrenia,becausethere
were too few cases; (2) hypomania, because participants with
this disorder were significantly more likely to be missing fol-
low-up data than were those without the disorder (33.3% vs
11.0%, P=.01); and (3) diagnoses assessed only for juveniles
(attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and
oppositional defiant disorder) or adults (antisocial personal-
ity disorder), because nearly all participants became 18 years
old or older during the follow-up period. Instead, we esti-
mated changes over time in any disruptive behavior disorder,
defined as conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder
(for participants aged 18 years) or antisocial personality dis-
order (for participants aged 18 years).
Because detention may alter access to substances, all mod-
els describing substance use disorders included linear and qua-
dratic terms for time incarcerated prior to the interviews. When
substance use disorder was measured at a follow-up inter-
view, we used number of days incarcerated in the past year be-
cause disorders were assessed in the past year. When sub-
stance use disorder was measured at the baseline interview (and
therefore assessed in the past 6 months), we used time incar-
cerated in the past 90 days, the best available estimate. All analy-
ses were conducted using commercial software (Stata 11; Stata-
Corp) with its survey routines.92
RESULTS
PREVALENCE
Table 1 and Table 2 report prevalence rates of disor-
ders--computed with and without the impairment cri-
terion--at baseline, time 1, and time 2 for males and fe-
males. At time 2, more than 45% of the males and nearly
30% of the females had any disorder with impairment.
More than 50% of the males and more than 40% of the
females had 1 or more psychiatric disorders without im-
pairment. Even excluding disruptive behavior disor-
ders, 36.9% of males and 25.3% of females had any dis-
order.
Prevalence rates of disorder by race/ethnicity for males
and females are given in eTable 2 and eTable 3. Among
males, 44.3% of African Americans, 49.8% of Hispanics,
and 63.9% of non-Hispanic whites had any disorder
at time 2. More than one-quarter of African American fe-
males and more than one-third of Hispanic and non-
Hispanic white females had any disorder.
MOOD DISORDERS
Other than mania, prevalence rates decreased as the par-
ticipants aged. For every additional year, there was an
approximately 10% decrease in the odds of any mood dis-
order (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85-
0.97) and its subcategories: any major mood disorder
(AOR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82-0.96) and major depression
(AOR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.98). The prevalence of dys-
thymia also decreased with age (AOR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.46-
0.70).
Sex Differences
Over time, females had higher rates of any mood disor-
der (AOR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.05-1.68) and its subcatego-
ries: any major mood disorder (AOR, 1.54; 95% CI,
1.19-2.00) and major depression (AOR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.22-
2.08). Figure 1 illustrates prevalence rates of major mood
disorders over time by sex.
Racial/Ethnic Differences
The only significant racial/ethnic difference was for ma-
nia, which was more prevalent among minorities over time
(African American vs non-Hispanic white: AOR, 6.92; 95%
CI, 1.78-26.88; Hispanic vs non-Hispanic white: AOR,
8.01; 95% CI, 2.05-31.38).
ANXIETY DISORDERS
The prevalence of panic disorder increased slightly over-
all (AOR, 1.30 per year; 95% CI, 1.03-1.65). Figure 1
shows changes in prevalence rates over time by sex.
Sex Differences
Females had higher rates of any anxiety disorder (AOR,
1.42; 95% CI, 1.06-1.91). Although rates of PTSD ap-
peared to decrease, especially for females, this trend was
not statistically significant (AOR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.81-
1.05).
Racial/Ethnic Differences
Compared with non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics had
more than twice the odds of any anxiety disorder (AOR,
2.18; 95% CI, 1.37-3.49) and its subcategory PTSD
(AOR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.66-4.80). Compared with Afri-
can Americans, Hispanics had 3.82 times the odds of
panic disorder (95% CI, 1.54-9.47) and 1.54 times the
odds of PTSD (95% CI, 1.01-2.34). In addition, African
Americans were more likely than non-Hispanic whites
to have PTSD (AOR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.10-3.07), although
non-Hispanic whites were more likely than African
Americans to have panic disorder (AOR, 3.56; 95% CI,
1.28-9.94).
DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR DISORDERS
The prevalence of any disruptive behavior disorder de-
creased over time, but the rate of decrease depended on

sex. Figure 2 illustrates these sex differences over
time.
Sex Differences
Males and females did not have significantly different
rates of any disruptive behavior disorder at baseline,
but prevalence decreased faster among females than
among males. Three years after baseline, males had
1.82 times the odds of any disruptive behavior disor-
der (95% CI, 1.46-2.26) compared with females; 5
years after baseline, males had 2.95 times the odds
(95% CI, 2.16-4.02).
Racial/Ethnic Differences
As illustrated in Figure 2, non-Hispanic whites had the
highest rates of any disruptive behavior disorder over time
(non-Hispanic white vs African American: AOR, 2.34; 95%
CI, 1.80-3.04; non-Hispanic white vs Hispanic: AOR, 1.56;
95% CI, 1.16-2.11), followed by Hispanics (Hispanic vs
African American: AOR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.10-2.04).
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS
Substance use disorders were the most prevalent disor-
dersinoursample.Theprevalencegenerallydecreasedover

illustrates sex and racial/ethnic differences over time.

disorder were not significantly different. By the fol-
low-up interviews, however, the disparities between males

disorders compared with females (any substance use dis-
order: AOR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.96-3.47; drug use disorder:
AOR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.88-3.58; and alcohol use disorder:
AOR, 2.87; 95% CI, 2.00-4.13). Although the prevalence
rates of most disorders decreased for males and females
(Figure 2), 3 years after baseline, rates of alcohol disor-
der were no longer decreasing among males (AOR, 1.03
per year; 95% CI, 0.96-1.11).
Racial/Ethnic Differences
Even after adjusting for time spent in correctional facili-
ties, substance use disorders were more common
among non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics than among
African Americans (Figure 2). Compared with African
Americans, non-Hispanic whites had nearly twice the
odds of any substance use disorder and its subcategory,
drug use disorder (AOR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.54-2.49 and
AOR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.50-2.43, respectively), and 1.57
times the odds of alcohol disorder (95% CI, 1.15-2.13).
Hispanics had approximately 1.5 times the odds of any
substance use disorder and its subcategory, drug use
disorder, compared with African Americans (AOR,
1.59; 95% CI, 1.24-2.03 and AOR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.12-
1.92, respectively).
We also analyzed substance use disorders without im-
pairment criteria, an approach used by recent studies of
the general population.50,58 Results were substantially simi-
lar (available on request).
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS
AMONG PARTICIPANTS LIVING
IN THE COMMUNITY
AT TIME 2
Because substance use is restricted in jails and prisons,
we examined rates of substance use disorders only
among participants who had lived in the community
the entire year before time 2 (345 males and 479 fe-
males). These prevalence rates, and the demographic
differences, were substantially similar to those in the
entire sample (eTable 4).

PERSISTENCE
Table 3 reports the persistence of disorders: among par-
ticipants who had the disorder at baseline, the propor-
tion who still had the disorder at time 1 or time 2. For
most disorders, rates of persistence were higher at time
1 than at time 2.
Sex Differences
Regardless of sex, approximately 1 in 5 participants had
a mood disorder that persisted to time 2. Substance use
disorders were among the most persistent disorders for
both males and females but were significantly more likely
to persist among males. Any disruptive behavior disor-
der was also among the most persistent disorders in males
and at time 2 was significantly more likely to persist in
males than in females.
Racial/Ethnic Differences
Among males, there were no significant racial/ethnic
differences in the persistence of disorders (eTable 5).
Among females, there were several significant differ-
ences (eTable 6). At time 1, any substance use disorder
and its subcategory, alcohol use disorder, had approxi-
mately 3 times the odds of persisting among non-
Hispanic whites and Hispanics than among African Ameri-
cans. At time 2, drug use disorders also had greater odds
of persisting among non-Hispanic whites than among Afri-
can Americans.
COMMENT
Although prevalence rates of most psychiatric disorders
declined over time, a substantial proportion of delin-
quent youth continued to have disorders as they aged.
For some youth, detention may coincide with a period
of crisis that subsequently abates. Many youth, how-
ever, continue to struggle: 5 years after detention, when
participants were ages 14 to 24 years, nearly half of males
and nearly 30% of females had 1 or more psychiatric dis-
orders with associated impairment.
Substance use and disruptive behavior disorders con-
tinued to be the most common disorders. For many de-
linquent youth--especially males--externalizing disor-
ders were not limited to adolescence. Five years after
baseline, males had 2 to 3 times the odds of having sub-
stance use and disruptive behavior disorders compared
with females. Furthermore, the disparity between males
and females increased over time. Males were also more
likely than females to have persistent substance use dis-
orders and disruptive behavior disorder.
The observed sex differences in externalizing disor-
ders are consistent with those in the general population,
where males are up to 10 times more likely than females
to persist in antisocial behavior from childhood to adult-
hood.93 Why might males fare worse than females? First,
delinquent males are less likely to receive services.94 Sec-
ond, delinquent males may have fewer opportunities to as-
sume age-appropriate social roles (ie, jobs, postsecondary
schooling)--turning points that might reduce problem be-

such as parenthood, may be associated with worse out-
comes for males than for females.96-98
Asinthegeneralpopulation,99 femaleshadhigherrates
ofinternalizingdisordersthanmales.Thepersistenceofmood
disorders, about 20%, was similar in males and females.
Rates of substance use disorders and disruptive behav-
ior disorders were lower in African Americans than non-
Hispanic whites. These findings may reflect underlying ra-
cial/ethnic disparities in the legal system71,100-102 and the
differentpathwaysbywhichnon-Hispanicwhitesandracial/
ethnic minorities enter the system. We found racial/
ethnic differences in substance use disorders even after tak-
ing into account that African Americans spend more time
in correctional facilities, where access to alcohol and drugs
is restricted.100,101 Our findings add to the growing debate
about how the "war on drugs" has affected the dispropor-
tionate incarceration of African Americans. Many investi-
gators suggest that disproportionate confinement of racial/
ethnic minorities for drug offenses is the result, in part, of
disparate enforcement of drug laws in African American
communities rather than higher rates of use or deal-
ing.103-107 Our findings appear consistent with this view.
It is difficult to compare specific prevalence rates in
our sample with those in the general population be-
cause differences in instrumentation and sample demo-
graphics limit meaningful comparisons. The National Co-
morbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) provides the most
comparable data to our time 2 interview. Although the
NCS-R used different, and often less stringent, impair-
ment criteria and did not assess the same disorders (eg,
antisocial personality disorder), it provides DSM-IV di-
agnoses for a similarly aged sample (18-24 years).108,109
The most marked discrepancies between our findings and
those of NCS-R were for drug use disorders, regardless
of sex and race/ethnicity. For example, we found that ap-
proximately 20% of males had a drug use disorder com-
pared with approximately 7% in the NCS-R; nearly 14%
of Hispanic females and nearly 25% of Hispanic males
had a drug use disorder compared with less than 5% of
Hispanics in the NCS-R.99
Changesinprevalenceovertimemirrorthoseinthegen-
eral population for most disorders. As summarized in the
recent literature review by Costello et al,110 many disor-
ders in the general population decrease from adolescence
to young adulthood, with the exception of panic disor-
ders and substance use disorders, which increase48,111-116;
findings on depression have been equivocal.48,111-116 Again,
oursampleismostnotablydifferentfromthegeneralpopu-
lation in substance use disorders: our rates decreased over
time. Perhaps substance abuse peaks earlier in delinquent
youth, coinciding with the general course of delinquent be-
havior.117,118 In contrast, general population youth may ex-
perience events that increase the likelihood of substance
abuse as they age,119,120 such as living in college dormito-
ries, freedom from social controls, and delays in assuming
adult responsibilities such as parenting--events less likely
to be experienced by delinquent youth.121

LIMITATIONS
Our data are subject to the limitations of self-report. More-
over, it was not feasible to study more than one jurisdic-
tion; because the prevalence of psychiatric disorders may
vary across jurisdictions,14,122,123 generalizability may be
limited. We cannot know whether psychiatric disorders
increase the likelihood of arrest and detention or vice
versa. Findings might have been marginally different had
we been able to use identical measures and time frames
at the baseline and follow-up interviews. Rates would
likely have been higher had caretakers been available to
provide independent reports at baseline.15 At the fol-
low-up interviews, many participants were not eligible
to have caretakers interviewed because the participants
were older than 17 years or did not live with a caretaker.
Although retention rates were high, participants who
missed interviews might be more likely to have had dis-
orders than those who were found. Our findings do not
take into account mental health services that might have
been provided. Despite these limitations, our findings have
implications for future research and mental health policy.
DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
1. Retain incarcerated persons in longitudinal studies
ofpsychiatricdisorders.Mostlarge-scalelongitudinalstud-
ies of the general population do not retain persons who
become incarcerated by follow-up (eg, the National Epi-
demiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions [B.
Grant,PhD,PhD,emailcommunication,August13,2010])
orreinterviewtoofewtoanalyze(theEpidemiologicCatch-
ment Area Study [W. Eaton, PhD, oral communication,
August 11, 2010]). Thus, these samples are biased: they
systematically exclude persons who, as our study sug-
gests, are likely to have psychiatric disorders and poor out-
comes. Excluding incarcerated persons biases prevalence
rates, especially for African American males. At any given
time, nearly 1 in 9 African American males aged 25 to 34
years are incarcerated.71 To address health disparities, we
must include correctional populations, which have in-
creased from approximately 2 million in 2000 to nearly
2.4 million in 2008.71,124
2. Add variables on incarceration history to general
population studies. Although many studies examine the
prevalence of psychiatric disorders in incarcerated
populations,13-16,74,122,125-127 few focus on the effect of in-
carceration on psychiatric disorders. We suggest that
general population epidemiologic surveys add the fol-
lowing variables: number of incarcerations, age at time
of incarceration, length of incarcerations, and experi-
ences in "community corrections" (parole, probation, and
community supervision). This strategy would generate
necessary information on how disproportionate confine-
ment of racial/ethnic minorities affects health dispari-
ties in psychiatric disorders and related outcomes.
3. Include females in longitudinal studies of delin-
quents. The sex differences observed in our study un-
derscore that findings for males may not generalize to

females. Yet, most longitudinal studies of delinquents ex-
clude females or sample too few to analyze sex differ-
ences (summary tables available on request). Future stud-
ies must include females and collect data on pregnancy,
childbirth, and child-rearing. We will then have the req-
uisite empirical foundation to improve sex-specific men-
tal health services, especially needed now that females
constitute an increasing proportion (now 30%128) of ju-
venile arrests.
4. Examine variables that affect trajectories of disor-
der in high-risk youth. Few studies of high-risk youth ex-
amine trajectories of disorder; fewer still examine how po-
tentially modifiable risk and protective factors predict
trajectories of disorder. Future studies should investigate
howsocial,cognitive,andbiologicalfactorsinteracttoaffect
trajectories. For example, advances in neuroscience re-
search provide unique opportunities to investigate how de-
velopmentaldifferencesinemotionregulationinteractwith
"turning points" to alter trajectories.129-131
IMPLICATIONS FOR
MENTAL HEALTH POLICY
1. Focus on delinquent males. In recent years, inno-
vative programs funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice
and Delinquency Prevention132--such as Girl Talk,133 and
Girl Scouts in Detention Centers--addressed the needs
of delinquent females.134-136 The mental health system must
now improve services for males, who constitute 70% of
juvenile arrests and 85% of youth in correctional facili-
ties.17,128 Our findings demonstrate that interventions for
substance use and disruptive behavior disorders are es-
pecially needed. Comprehensive interventions, such as
functional family therapy,137 multidimensional treat-
ment foster care,138 and multisystemic therapy,139 can be
effective. Continued development and dissemination of
these programs can further reduce illegal behaviors and
provide cost-effective alternatives to incarceration.140
2. Assess and treat substance use disorders in correc-
tional facilities and after release. Irrespective of sex or race/
ethnicity, alcohol and drug use disorders were among the
most common and persistent disorders. However, the need
for services far exceeds their availability. Approxi-
mately one-half of youth in juvenile correctional facili-
ties141,142 and approximately three-quarters of youth in
adult jails and prisons who need substance abuse treat-
ment do not receive it.141 Incarcerated adults fare much
worse: summarizing Department of Justice statis-
tics,143,144 a recent study published in JAMA145 con-
cluded that 80% to 85% of adult prisoners who needed
treatment for drug abuse did not receive it. After release
back to the community, services may be difficult to ob-
tain. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration reports, for example, that fewer than 10%
of juveniles146 and adults147 with an "alcohol use prob-
lem" received specialty services in the past year.
Despite the potential of health care reform, the law
may not improve mental health services for persons like
our participants, who may frequently cycle through cor-
rectional facilities. Health care reform has no benefit to
prisoners because federal law prohibits Medicaid pay-
ments for individuals--juvenile or adult--who are in-
mates of public institutions.148 Incarceration disrupts com-
munity treatment and Medicaid benefits.149
Moreover, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act (PPACA) has limitations. First, although the Su-
preme Court upheld most provisions of the PPACA,150 the
law does not improve the deteriorating public health in-
frastructure,151,152 wheremanyimpoverishedpersonswould
receive treatment153,154 after being released from correc-
tions.Second,althoughthePPACAexpandsMedicaidben-
efitstopersonswithincomesupto133%ofthefederalpov-
erty level, the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt
out.155 The effect of the Supreme Court's ruling is not yet
known.Manypersonslikeourparticipantsarepoorenough
to qualify for Medicaid even without the expansion. More-
over,stateshavestrongfinancialincentivestoexpandMed-
icaid.156,157 Thus, as of this writing, it is unclear how many
additional people would actually receive health care cov-
erage. Since the Supreme Court's decision, the Congres-
sional Budget Office158 projected that 30 million "nonel-
derly residents"--such as undocumented immigrants and
persons with low incomes who fail to enroll in Medic-
aid152,153--will remain uninsured in 2016. Therefore, we
must improve services and access to care in corrections and
in the community, where virtually all detained juveniles
and incarcerated adults will eventually return.
