Children in South Asia Have Higher Body Mass­Adjusted Blood
Pressure Levels Than White Children in the United States
A Comparative Study

Background--Blood pressure during childhood is an established predictor of adult blood pressure, which in turn increases
mortality as a result of cardiovascular disease. Adult South Asian populations are particularly predisposed to
cardiovascular disease compared with whites, but the prevalence of high blood pressure and determinants of blood
pressure in South Asian children have not been explored or compared with those of white children.
Methods and Results--Analyses were performed on 5641 South Asian children 5 to 14 years old included in the nationally
representative National Health Survey of Pakistan (NHSP) (1990­1994) and on 4756 white children 5 to 14 years old
included in Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) (1988­1994). Anthropometric
measurements were obtained. Blood pressure was measured twice in the seated position with a mercury sphygmoma-
nometer and an appropriate-size cuff. High blood pressure was defined as a systolic or diastolic blood pressure level that
was 95th percentile of age-, sex-, and height-percentile­specific reference level for the US population. Mean body
mass index (BMI)­adjusted blood pressure values were compared among children in 2 data sets by use of linear
regression analysis. The overall prevalence (95% CI) of high blood pressure in South Asian children 5 to 14 years old
was 12.2% (11.3% to 13.1%): 15.8% (14.5% to 17.1%) in boys and 8.7% (7.6% to 9.8%) in girls. This is in sharp
contrast with the predicted 5% prevalence of high blood pressure in children in the United States (P0.001). The mean
BMI-adjusted systolic blood pressure levels (SD) were 100 (11) versus 99 (11) mm Hg (P0.001), and diastolic blood
pressure levels (SD) were 63 (10) versus 52 (12) mm Hg (P0.001) in NHSP versus NHANES III, respectively.
Conclusions--South Asian children have higher body-mass­adjusted blood pressure levels than white children in the United
States. Further studies are needed to determine factors responsible for these differences. Immediate attention is needed to
address high blood pressure and its risk factors in native South Asian children. (Circulation. 2005;111:1291-1297.)
Key Words: blood pressure  pediatrics  epidemiology  ethnic groups
Migrant populations of South Asian origin (India, Paki-
stan, and Bangladesh) living in the West are at higher
risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with
whites,1­3 but the problems of noncommunicable diseases are
not limited only to South Asian populations residing in the
West. South Asian countries, home to approximately one
quarter of the world's population, are major contributors to
the global burden of CVD at present, and this contribution is
projected to grow, given their consistent population growth
rates.4 Hypertension, the most common risk factor for CVD,
has now become a major health problem in Pakistan, affect-
ing 17.9% of all adults 15 years old and 1 in 3 adults 45
years old.5 Thus, prevention of high blood pressure and CVD
needs urgent attention in South Asia.
The knowledge that blood pressure during childhood is an
established predictor of adult blood pressure, which in turn
increases mortality from CVD, clearly underscores the impor-
tance of studying childhood blood pressure and the need for
establishing preventive measures in early life.6,7 The Fourth
Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High
Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents recommends age-,
sex-, and height-specific values that are at 95th percentile of
normative systolic and diastolic blood pressure values as diag-
nostic of high blood pressure in childhood.8 Unfortunately, data
on age-specific blood pressure levels in children of South Asian
origin are scarce. To date, studies of blood pressure in South
Asian children have suffered from inadequate sample size or
have been restricted to distinct communities.9­12

We therefore used data in South Asian children 5 to 14
years old included in the nationally representative National
Health Survey of Pakistan (NHSP) (1990­1994) to determine
the prevalence of high blood pressure in children in Pakistan.
We also compared blood pressure levels among children 5 to
14 years old included in the NHSP with those surveyed in the
United States during the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III), 1988 to 1994.13 In
addition, we studied the correlates of systolic and diastolic
blood pressure in South Asian children.
Methods
NHSP (1990­1994)
Cross-sectional data were collected during the NHSP over a period
of 4 years (1990­1994) by the Pakistan Medical Research Council,
under the technical guidance and support of the US National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS).14 The overall design of NHSP was a
modification of NHANES III conducted by the NCHS, tailored to the
needs of Pakistan. The details of sampling, design, components,
survey instrument, and quality control have been reported previous-
ly.5,15 Briefly, the survey was conducted on a nationally representa-
tive sample of 18 135 individuals 6 months to 110 years old from
2400 urban and rural households after informed consent had been
obtained. A 2-stage stratified design was used. The urban and rural
areas of each of the 4 provinces of Pakistan were taken as strata.
There were 80 urban or rural primary sampling units. A total of 30
households were drawn into the sample from each unit, and all
residents of the household were included in the study. The overall
individual response rate was 92.6%. The total number of individuals
5 years old was 15 083. Out of these, 5641 subjects were between
5 and 14 years old.
Data on demographic, lifestyle, socioeconomic, and health-related
variables were collected by use of a questionnaire validated in local
languages. Physicians at mobile examination centers performed a
standardized physical examination. Mothers were proxy respondents
for children 12 years old. Trained technicians performed anthro-
pometric examinations. Blood pressure was measured by certified
physicians in a standardized manner. Blood pressure certification
consisted of measurement performance on live volunteers. As in
NHANES III, the physician selected one of 5 (infant, child, adult,
large adult, and thigh) cuff sizes for blood pressure measurement on
the basis of the size of the participant's arm. Blood pressure was
measured in the seated position by use of a mercury sphygmoma-
nometer with the right forearm horizontal on a table. After the
appropriate-size cuff for children had been applied (covering approx-
imately two thirds of the upper arm), the cuff was gradually inflated
to approximately 20 mm Hg above the point at which the radial pulse
disappeared. The pressure within the cuff was then released at a rate
of approximately 2 mm Hg/s while auscultating with a stethoscope
over the brachial artery. The onset of sound (Korotkoff phase I) was
indicative of systolic blood pressure, and the disappearance of the
sound (Korotkoff phase V) was taken as indicative of diastolic blood
pressure.16 Two readings were recorded at an interval of 1 to 2
minutes, and the cuff was completely deflated between the readings.
The mean of 2 readings was calculated for final analysis.
Weight and height were recorded for each individual in light
clothing without shoes. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Pulse rate
was measured by noting pulsations of the radial artery at the right
wrist in the sitting position. Quality control for the survey and blood
pressure measurements included a visit to the field by expert
consultants, duplicate examination by field supervisors, calibration
protocols, and retraining exercises.15
Urban and rural areas were classified according to the definition
used by the Federal Bureau of Statistics, according to which thinly
populated, largely agricultural areas (5000 people) with poor
availability of basic amenities (eg, electricity) are considered rural.14
Ethnicity was reported as "mother tongue," which is specific for each
of the 5 major ethnic subgroups of Pakistan: Muhajir, Punjabi,
Sindhi, Pashtun, and Baluchi. Levels of socioeconomic status were
defined through a count of the number of items owned. An index of
household item (eg, television, refrigerator, automobile) ownership
was constructed by summing up items owned by the household. This
methodology has been shown to be particularly useful for measuring
health inequalities that result from the direct effects of material
conditions and has been validated previously.17,18 Two components
of saturated fat intake were defined: (1) intake of ghee (hydrogenated
oil/clarified butter), depending on whether or not these were con-
sumed daily, and (2) meat (animal fat) intake, depending on whether
or not the meat was consumed at least every other day. High intakes
of calcium and potassium were defined as daily consumption of dairy
products and fruits, respectively.
High blood pressure in children was defined as systolic or diastolic
blood pressure of 95 percentile of age-, sex-, and height-specific
levels of blood pressure of the reference US population.8
A family history of hypertension was defined by the presence of
hypertension (systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or diastolic
blood pressure 90 mm Hg based on the mean of 2 readings, or
current therapy with antihypertensive medications) in any adult
member (15 years old) of the household.
NHANES III (1988­1994)
NHANES III is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of
the population in the United States. Details of its design and conduct
have been published previously.13 As in NHSP, blood pressure
measurements were obtained in the seated position for children 5
years old or older in a standardized manner with a mercury
sphygmomanometer.13 Although 3 readings of blood pressure were
recorded, to be consistent with NHSP, a mean of the first 2 readings
was calculated for our analysis (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/
major/nhanes/nh3data.htm; accessed December 2004). A total of 6980
children 5 to 14 years old were included in NHANES III. Of these, 2224
belonged to the black race and were excluded from this analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Age- and height-percentile­specific systolic and diastolic blood
pressure values for South Asian children 5 to 14 years old from
NHSP data were plotted on normograms derived for the US
population.8 The overall and age-specific prevalence of high blood
pressure was computed for South Asian children and compared with
the overall prevalence of the same in children in the United States by
use of 2 test.
Linear regression analyses were used for the outcomes of systolic
and diastolic blood pressure levels to determine the association of
ethnicity (United States versus Pakistan) after adjustment for BMI.
To assess the reproducibility of blood pressure readings in the 2
surveys, the mean difference (SEM) between the first and the second
readings and the correlation between the 2 were computed.
The associations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure with
sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were studied by use of
univariate and multivariate analyses in children 5 to 14 years old in
the NHSP data. The candidate predictor list included ethnicity; age;
sex; BMI; low versus high socioeconomic status; urban versus rural
dwelling; consumption of food rich in saturated fats (meat and ghee),
potassium (fruits), and calcium (dairy products); and a family history
of hypertension and heart rate.
Stepwise linear regression analyses were conducted by use of
forward selection with an entry criterion of P0.1 for the primary
outcomes of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. All adjusted
associated factors of systolic and diastolic blood pressures were
retained in the respective final models. In addition, variables signif-
icantly associated with the outcome (P0.05) in the univariate
analyses were forced into the multivariate models. Interactions
between age, ethnicity, BMI, and sex with each other and with other
variables were tested in the final models. SAS version 8.0 software
was used for all analyses.

Results
In the NHSP data, a total of 5641 subjects were 5 to 14 years
old: 2974 (52.7%) boys and 2667 (47.3%) girls. Two readings
of blood pressure were recorded in 5495 subjects (97.4%):
2926 boys and 2569 girls. Out of these, BMIs were measured
in 5374 subjects (97.8%): 2866 boys and 2508 girls.
In NHANES III, a total of 4756 white children were 5 to 14
years old: 2343 (49.3%) boys and 2413 (50.7%) girls. Two
readings of blood pressure were recorded in 3420 subjects
(71.9%): 1662 boys and 1758 girls. Out of these, BMIs were
measured in 3389 subjects (99.1%): 1647 boys and 1742 girls.
The mean BMI (SD) was significantly lower in children in
NHSP versus NHANES III: 15.2 (4.3) versus 18.3 (3.9) in
boys, respectively, and 15.3 (4.3) versus 18.5 (4.1) in girls,
respectively, (P0.001 for each). The characteristics of
children included in the 2 surveys are shown in Table 1.
Comparison of Blood Pressure in Children in
South Asia Versus Those in the United States
Table 2 shows the age-specific prevalence of hypertensive
children 5 to 14 years old in NHSP using age-specific z height
percentile for this population and blood pressure levels based
on nomograms for children in the United States as reference.8
The overall prevalence (95% CI) of high blood pressure in
Pakistani children 5 to 14 years old was 12.2% (11.3% to
13.1%): 15.8% (14.5% to 17.1%) in boys and 8.7% (7.6% to
8.9%) in girls. This is in sharp contrast with the overall
predicted 5% prevalence of high blood pressure in children in
the United States (P0.001).
The Figure illustrates the comparison among BMI-specific
systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels in children 5 to 14
years old surveyed in NHSP and children in NHANES III.13
Among these children, the mean BMI-adjusted systolic blood
pressures were 10011 versus 9911 mm Hg (P0.001.), and
diastolic blood pressures (SD) were 6310 versus 5212 mm Hg
(P0.001) in NHSP versus NHANES III, respectively.
Comparison of the first with the second blood pressure
readings in NHSP and NHANES III revealed a mean differ-
ence (SEM) of 0.7 (0.1) versus 0.9 (0.1) mm Hg, respectively,
in systolic blood pressure and 0.5 (0.1) and 0.5 (0.2) mm Hg,
respectively, in diastolic blood pressure. The correlation

High blood pressure is defined as having systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure 95th percentile of age-, sex-, and
height-specific levels for children in the United States. Systolic high blood pressure is defined as systolic blood pressure 95th
percentile of age-, sex-, and height-specific levels for children in the United States. Diastolic high blood pressure is defined as diastolic
blood pressure 95th percentile of age-, sex-, and height-specific levels for children in the United States.

coefficient between the 2 readings of systolic blood pressure
was r0.92 and r0.89, (P0.001 for each), respectively,
and those of diastolic blood pressure were r0.93 and
r0.76 (P0.001 and P0.01), respectively.
Factors Associated With Systolic and Diastolic
Blood Pressure Levels in South Asian Children
The results of univariate and multivariate analyses for each
outcome are shown in Table 3. The adjusted associated
factors for systolic and diastolic blood pressure were increas-
ing age (P0.001 for each), greater BMI (P0.004 and
P0.03, respectively), male sex (P0.001 for each), high
consumption of meat (P0.001 for each), high consumption
of ghee (P0.04 and P0.001, respectively), family history
of hypertension (P0.001 for each), and ethnicity (P0.001
for each). In addition, systolic blood pressure was associated
with rural versus urban dwelling (P0.001), increased heart
rate (P0.001), and diastolic blood pressure with low con-
sumption of calcium-containing food (P0.001).
The residuals from the final model were normally distrib-
uted, and there were no detectable patterns of distribution of
standardized residuals against predicted values of systolic
blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure.
Tests for interactions in the final model revealed signifi-
cant interaction between age and sex for the outcomes of
systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P0.001 and P0.03,
respectively). The interaction terms suggested that the rise in
systolic and diastolic blood pressure with each 1-year in-
crease in age were 1.55 (1.43, 1.68) and 1.12 (1.00,
1.24) mm Hg in boys and 2.09 (1.95, 2.23) and 1.32 (1.18,
1.46) mm Hg in girls.
Discussion
This is the first report of the associates of blood pressure in
South Asian children of Pakistan based on a sound nationally
representative epidemiological survey. Using blood pressure­
normative data in children in the United States as reference,
the overall prevalence (95% CI) of high blood pressure in
Pakistani children 5 to 14 years old was 12.2% (11.3% to
13.1%): 15.8% (14.5% to 17.1%) in boys and 8.7% (7.6% to
9.8%) in girls.8 The BMI-standardized levels of diastolic
blood pressure were significantly higher in South Asian
children compared with those in the United States.13
An increased prevalence of childhood cardiovascular risk
factors is predictive of increased carotid intimal-medial thick-
ness, which is a determinant of cardiovascular events.19,20
Recent data from the population-based Bogalusa Heart Study
and the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study show that
systolic blood pressure elevations beginning in childhood are
a consistent predictor of arterial stiffness in young adults.6,19
Numerous studies have highlighted the importance of diastol-
ic blood pressure in children, which has been suggested to be
a good predictor of adult hypertension and CVD.21,22 Lower-
ing blood pressure in hypertensive adults slows the progres-
sion of arterial stiffness and lowers the risk of CVD.23,24
Thus, institution of measures during childhood for prevention
of high blood pressure is essential for optimal risk reduction
of CVD.
It is interesting to note that prevalence of high blood
pressure is greater among children in Pakistan (12%) com-
pared with the 5% predicted for children in the United States.8
This is despite lower BMIs of Pakistani children.13 The
reason for this paradox is unclear but could be attributed to
ethnic differences between the 2 populations. Ethnic differ-
ences in blood pressure have been reported in other popula-
tions as well.1,25,26 Prospective studies are needed to explore
the potential relationships between ethnicity and blood
pressure.
Furthermore, low birth weight has been shown to be
associated with chronic diseases, including diabetes and high
blood pressure,27­29 though this notion has been challenged
by some.30 Adverse outcomes of pregnancy, including ma-
ternal morbidity and mortality, intrauterine growth retarda-
tion, and low-birth-weight infants, are much more common in
developing countries, especially South Asia, compared with
the West.31,32 Whether a greater prevalence of high blood
pressure in South Asian children despite lower BMIs is a
reflection of lower birth weight remains to be determined.29,33
Our findings also raise the important question of the
suitability of criteria for diagnosis of high blood pressure in
South Asian children. The Fourth Report on the Diagnosis,
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Chil-
dren and Adolescents recommends age-, sex-, and height-
specific blood pressure values that are above the 95th
percentile of normative systolic and diastolic blood pressure
values among the US population as diagnostic of high blood
pressure in childhood.8 On the basis of this definition, 5% of
children in any given population would be classified as
having high blood pressure. Using the 95th percentile for
blood pressure recorded among children in the United States
as reference, the prevalence of high blood pressure in children
in Pakistan was 12.2% (11.3% to 13.1%). Clearly, it cannot
be assumed that the threshold blood pressure level for
end-organ damage would be higher for South Asian children.
Therefore, appropriate reference populations and blood pres-
sure cutoff values for the diagnosis of high blood pressure in
children of South Asian as well as other ethnic descent need
to be determined.
BMI-specific blood pressure levels in children in Pakistan vs
white children in the United States. Data are on 5374 South
Asian children aged 5 to 14 years included in the NHSP (1990­
1994) and 3389 white children in the United States included in
NHANES III (1988­1994). BMI cutoffs are based on 25th, 50th,
75th, and 95th percentiles of values in NHSP data. P values are
based on ANOVA among children in NHSP vs NHANES III.

Our analyses revealed that children residing in urban
compared with rural parts of Pakistan have an adjusted
systolic pressure that was lower by 1.56 (95% CI, 0.95,
2.18) mm Hg. The same trend has been reported from other
developing regions of the world.34 The poorer health facilities
and lower literacy status of women in rural versus urban areas
lead to a greater proportion of adverse outcomes of pregnan-
cy,35,36 one manifestation of which could be elevated blood
pressure during childhood.27­29 The reason for higher blood
pressure in rural versus urban children in Pakistan deserves
further study.
Obesity during childhood has been reported to be strongly
associated with systolic blood pressure in children and in
adults.37 We also observed significant relationships between
blood pressure and BMI in children. This is despite lower
BMIs of children in Pakistan compared with those in the
West. Recent evidence suggests that because of differences in
body stature, an equally high BMI confers more CVD risks in
Asian than in white populations.38,39 Therefore, the recent
WHO guidelines for defining obesity suggest lower cutoff
values of BMI in the Asian population.40 It is therefore
important to develop population-based distribution for com-
puting appropriate age-, sex-, and BMI-specific blood pres-
sure levels for children in this population.
Previously, we reported an independent association be-
tween high meat intake (as a proxy for animal fat consump-
tion) and hypertension in Pakistani adults.5 We now report the
same association with systolic and diastolic blood pressures
in children. In addition, ghee consumption was also positively
and independently associated with diastolic blood pressure in
children. Ghee contains cholesterol oxides that are thought to
be related to atherosclerosis.41 Our finding of an independent
association between high saturated fat content in diet and
blood pressure are consistent with those of the Bogalusa
study in children.42,43

We found significant ethnic differences in levels of systolic
and diastolic blood pressures, with Pashtuns, Muhajirs, and
Baluchis having significantly higher values than the Punjabis.
The variations in these 4 ethnic subgroups are consistent with
our findings in the adult population of Pakistan.5 This
suggests that these differences are likely to be a result of
genetic variations in susceptibility or early exposure to
environmental causes of high blood pressure.
Systolic blood pressure levels were significantly higher in
boys than in girls in both the US and South Asian popula-
tions. Multivariate analysis of data on South Asian children
revealed that these differences persisted even after adjustment
for sociodemographic factors. This is consistent with our
findings in adults.5 The mechanisms responsible for the sex
differences in blood pressure levels are not clear, although it
is speculated that interactions between sex hormones and the
kidneys could play a protective role in premenopausal wom-
en.44 The potential role of sex hormones on blood pressure in
women needs further study.
Our study has some limitations. First, the differences in
protocols and methodologies between the 2 surveys could
lead to differences in blood pressure measurements. Still,
both the NHANES III and NHSP were designed and con-
ducted under the supervision of NCHS and used similar
sampling rationales and techniques for measuring blood
pressure and BMI. Second, higher blood pressure levels in
NHSP versus NHANES could reflect a "white-coat effect"
because of less familiarity of Pakistani children with receiv-
ing blood pressure measurement. This is unlikely to explain
the entire difference in blood pressure levels between the 2
populations, however, because the white-coat effect tends to
affect systolic blood pressure more than diastolic blood
pressure, and the differences in the levels of the latter were
greater than those in the former. Furthermore, comparison of
data after adjustment for pulse rate, which is expected to
increase with the white-coat effect, revealed consistent results
(data not shown). Third, diastolic blood pressure levels are
traditionally more difficult to measure. Therefore, a wider
difference in levels of this component of blood pressure
between the US and Pakistani children may have several
interpretations. These include true findings versus measure-
ment errors. Furthermore, higher correlation between the 2
readings of diastolic blood pressure in NHSP (r0.93) than
in NHANES (r0.73) could reflect expectation bias on the
part of the NHSP research staff, though it is equally likely to
be a result of adherence of the latter to the study protocol.
Fourth, the blood pressure levels recorded in our study are
based on an average of 2 readings at a single visit. A more
precise clinical estimate would include measurements from
3 separate occasions. Still, multiple readings of blood
pressure from the same day are considered appropriate for
epidemiological studies.13 Furthermore, comparative blood
pressure levels from the US population reported in this article
are also based on an average of 2 readings at a single visit.
Moreover, the reproducibility of the second reading of blood
pressure compared with the first was good. In addition, our
main findings were similar on comparison with data collected
on children 8 to 14 years old during NHSP with NHANES
1999 to 2000 (data not shown) and with the average of the last
2 readings of blood pressure obtained during NHANES III.
Finally, it is remarkable that despite the lower BMIs of
Pakistani children, their blood pressure levels are higher than
American children, and even equal levels of blood pressure
between the 2 populations would have been noteworthy.
Thus, we believe that our findings are robust and alarming.
In the analysis for factors associated with blood pressure in
Pakistani children, we did not adjust for all known environ-
mental risk factors for high blood pressure. For instance,
information on sodium intake and physical activity was not
collected during the NHSP.45 Rural areas of Pakistan have the
highest proportion of the labor force employed in the agri-
cultural sector, ie, approximately 63.8%, whereas in the urban
areas, it is only 7.6%.46 It is known that child labor in the
agricultural sector accounts for 70% of working children
globally and in South Asia.47 Hence, physical activity is
likely to be greater among rural than urban children. There-
fore, it is perhaps surprising that blood pressures were higher
among rural children, and an evaluation of causative factors
for raised blood pressure in rural areas is required. Finally, the
food frequency questionnaire used during NHSP has not been
validated. Nevertheless, our findings warrant an in-depth
assessment of the potential dietary associations with blood
pressure and development of validated dietary questionnaires
in the native South Asian population.
In conclusion, this is the first report on levels and associ-
ates of blood pressure in a native South Asian sample of
nationally representative children of Pakistan. We found that
using the blood pressure normograms for children in the
United States as reference, the prevalence of high blood
pressure in children in Pakistan would be 12.6% (11.5% to
13.7%). This is substantially greater than the 5% predicted
prevalence of high blood pressure in children in the United
States based on same criteria, despite the lower BMIs of
South Asian children.8 The reasons for higher blood pressure
levels in South Asian children versus those in the United
States need exploration. The adjusted associated factors of
high blood pressure in South Asian children identified in our
study need immediate attention. Effective ways of identifying
South Asian children at high risk of high blood pressure and
CVD need to be identified and implemented.
