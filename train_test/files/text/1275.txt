Blood Pressure Parameters and Risk of
Fatal Stroke, NHANES II Mortality Study
David W. Brown, Wayne H. Giles, and Kurt J. Greenlund
Background: Recent studies have suggested that systolic
blood pressure (BP) is a better predictor of stroke than dia-
stolic BP in apparently healthy white men. Whether these
relationships are similar for women and African Americans
remains unclear.
Methods: We used data from 6667 (3205 men; 3462
women) adults from the Second National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey Mortality Study to examine
whether the relative risk of fatal stroke was associated
with a 10 mm Hg increase in BP parameters (systolic BP,
diastolic BP, pulse pressure, and mean arterial pressure).
Results: During a median of nearly 15 years of follow-
up, 113 fatal strokes (62 men; 51 women) occurred. Sys-
tolic BP was associated with an increased risk of fatal
stroke for men (relative risk [RR]  1.19), women (RR 
1.15), whites (RR  1.17), and African Americans (RR 
1.28) after multivariable adjustment (all, P  .05). Results
for other BP parameters were not consistent; simultaneous
consideration of two parameters did not improve predic-
tion of fatal stroke over systolic BP alone.
Conclusions: Our results agree with previous studies
that indicate systolic BP is an important predictor of stroke
risk for all groups within the population and provide
further evidence of the need to control systolic BP in the
population. Am J Hypertens 2007;20:338­341 © 2007

Hypertension, an important risk factor for stroke,
affects nearly 65 million Americans.1 Efforts to
treat and control elevated blood pressure (BP)
initially relied heavily on diastolic BP.2 Results from the
Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP)
trials performed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, how-
ever, shifted the focus to systolic BP.3 Recently, increased
attention has been given to pulse pressure (PP) (defined as
systolic BP  diastolic BP) and mean arterial pressure
(MAP) (defined as 2/3 diastolic BP  1/3 systolic BP) as a
predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke.4­7
Bowman and colleagues recently reported that of the four
BP parameters (systolic BP, diastolic BP, PP, MAP),
systolic BP was a consistent and more significant predictor
of CVD6 and stroke7 death among a sample of healthy,
predominantly white men from the Physician's Health
Study. Whether these results are similar for men and
women, and for African Americans and whites, remains
unknown.
We used data from the Second National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) Mortality
Study, a nationally representative cohort of US adults, to
examine the risk of fatal stroke associated with systolic
BP, diastolic BP, PP, and MAP stratified by gender and
ethnicity. Similar to Bowman and colleagues,6,7 we con-
sidered the BP parameters individually and systolic BP in
combination with the other three parameters to examine
whether two BP parameters improved the prediction of
stroke events.
Methods
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted
NHANES II between 1976 and 1980. NHANES II, a
nationwide probability sample of approximately 28,000
children and adults, was designed to be representative of
the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. A de-
tailed description of the NHANES II survey and sampling
procedures is available elsewhere.8
As part of NHANES II, persons underwent a physical
examination by a physician. At the beginning of the ex-
amination the physician measured the sample person's BP
(in mm Hg) while the individual was in a sitting position.
Blood pressure was taken twice more at the end of the
examination, once while the person was recumbent and
again while sitting. Thus, three BP readings were mea-
sured according to American Heart Association guide-
lines9 at baseline. The BP measurement used in this

analysis was the mean value of the second and third
readings. Serum cholesterol concentrations (in milligrams
per deciliter), height (in centimeters), and weight (kilo-
grams) were measured. Participants also completed a med-
ical history that included questions about CVD, physical
activity, and cigarette smoking, including a lifetime smok-
ing history and current smoking status (yes/no). Former
smokers were those who had smoked 100 cigarettes
during their lifetime but who were not currently smoking.
We merged baseline data from NHANES II with fol-
low-up data from the NHANES II Mortality Study, a
prospective cohort study of 9252 adults aged 30 to 75
years at the time of their NHANES II examination.10 As
part of the Mortality Study, data from the National Death
Index, which has been shown to capture 93% to 98% of all
US deaths,11­13 and from the Social Security Administra-
tion Death Master File were used to ascertain the vital
status of each cohort member through December 31, 1992
(approximately 17 years of follow-up). Information ob-
tained from the Mortality Study data included the month
and year in which a person was last known alive and the
International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision
(ICD-9) code for the cause of death. We used the 15th day
of the month in our analysis as the day of the date last known
alive for decedents. For all others, December 31, 1992, was
considered the last known date alive. Survival time was
calculated as the difference between the NHANES II baseline
examination date for each person and the last known date
alive obtained from the Mortality Study. Multiple causes
of death were available for 98% of decedents.
From the Mortality Study cohort (n  9252), we ex-
cluded those lost to follow-up, with missing data for study
variables, as well as those who were not either white or
African Americans, who reported a history of stroke or
coronary heart disease, or who were currently using anti-
hypertensive medications. A total of 6667 (3205 men;
3462 women) participants with complete information were
included in the analysis.
The outcome for the study was fatal stroke defined by
ICD-9 codes 430­438, excluding code 435 (eg, transient
ischemic attack). We used Cox proportional hazards re-
gression to estimate, by means of the hazard ratio, the
relative risk (RR) of fatal stroke associated with a 10 mm
Hg increase in each of the four BP parameters in regres-
sion models adjusted for age (continuous), gender, ethnic-
ity (white, African American), education (12 years, 12
years, 12 years), physical activity (moderate or inactive,
moderate, more than moderate), body mass index (defined
as weight in kg/height in meters squared; continuous),
smoking status (current, former, never), aspirin use, total
serum cholesterol (continuous), and diabetes (yes, no).
Each BP parameter was first modeled individually. We
then examined models with two BP parameters. We used
likelihood ratio tests (LR  2 ln L1
 [2 ln L2
]) to
compare regression models. We also assessed collinearity
between BP parameters using Pearson correlation coeffi-
cients and multicollinearity diagnostic statistics (tolerance
and variance inflation factors [VIF]). Although there is no
formal cutoff value to use with the VIF for determining the
presence of multicollinearity, values of VIF exceeding 10
are often regarded as indicative of multicollinearity. The
VIF values 2.5 may be cause for concern. To remain
consistent with the work of Bowman and colleagues in a
nationally representative cohort, we followed their manner
of analyses while reporting VIF values.
To make the NHANES representative of the US pop-
ulation, sample weights were used in all analyses. Statis-
tical analyses were completed using SAS v8.0 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (Research Triangle
Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). Models were fit to
the data using SUDAAN to account for the complex sam-
pling design and to achieve accurate variance estimates.
Categorical variables were compared between groups with a
2 test; continuous variables were compared between groups
with ANOVA. We assessed the appropriateness of the pro-
portional hazard assumption for the variables in our final
model with log­log survival plots and Schoenfeld residual
plots. Without exception, all covariates in the final model
satisfied the proportional hazard assumption. Model pa-
rameter estimates were computed by maximum likelihood
techniques. Relative hazards were obtained by exponenti-
ating estimated regression model coefficients, and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were based on the standard error
of the model coefficients. All statistical inferences were
based on a significance level of .05.
Results
A total of 6667 (3205 men; 3462 women) adults were
included in the analysis. The mean age (standard error of
mean) of the sample was 47 (0.25) years. The average sys-
tolic BP/diastolic BP was 127/79 mm Hg (124/77 mm Hg
for women; 130/82 mm Hg for men). Pearson correlation
coefficients were 0.717 for systolic BP versus diastolic BP,
0.815 for systolic BP versus PP, 0.913 for systolic BP
versus MAP, 0.181 for diastolic BP versus MAP, 0.939 for
diastolic BP versus MAP, and 0.509 for PP versus MAP
(all, P  .001) (data not shown). The VIF for systolic BP
was 2.5 and diastolic BP VIF was 2.3 within the systolic
BP­diastolic BP parameter pair. Systolic BP VIF was 3.9
and PP VIF 3.7 within the systolic BP­PP parameter pair,
and systolic BP VIF was 7.2 and MAP VIF was 6.9 within
the systolic BP­MAP parameter pair.
During follow-up (median  14.6 years), there were
113 fatal strokes (62 men; 51 women). Persons who died
from stroke were older (48% v 10% 65 years, P  .001),
and more likely to be men (59% v 48%, P  .019), less
educated (26% v 16% 12 years, P  .006), physically
inactive (18% v 13%, P  .034), and have diabetes (10%
v 3%, P  .027). Overall, mean systolic BP (P  .001),
diastolic BP (P  .051), PP (P  .001), and MAP (P 
.001) values were greater for those who died from stroke
compared to those who did not, although these patterns
differed somewhat by age. For example, BP parameters

were similar or slightly lower for fatal stroke cases than
for those who did not die among adults 65 to 74 years.
After multivariable adjustment, each of the individual
BP parameters was associated with an increased risk of
fatal stroke for the total sample (systolic BP: 1.18 [95%
CI, 1.07­1.31]; diastolic BP: 1.21 [95% CI, 0.92­1.59];
PP: 1.22 [95% CI, 1.10­1.35]; MAP: 1.26 [95% CI,
1.03­1.54]). Estimates for diastolic BP did not attain sta-
tistical significance in stratified analyses for men or
women (Fig. 1). In addition, MAP estimates were not
statistically significant for men, women, or whites. The
addition of a second BP parameter to a model containing
systolic BP did not improve model fit (P value for LR test
 .05, all). Addition of a diastolic BP, PP, or MAP
parameter to the systolic BP model resulted in a positive
association between systolic BP and the risk of fatal
stroke, whereas the associations for the second parameter
were attenuated and no longer predictive; statistically sig-
nificant RRs (P  .05) were observed for systolic BP RR,
1.20 [95% CI, 1.07­1.33] only in conjunction with dia-
stolic BP. Similar results were observed after stratifying
on ethnicity (white versus African Americans) (Fig. 1).
Discussion
The prevalence of hypertension, which affects nearly one
in three US adults, increased nearly 30% (from 50 to 65
million adults) in the US between 1988­1994 and 1999­
2000.1 The lifetime risk of developing hypertension
among middle-aged and older adults is 90%.14 In this
study of a nationally representative cohort of men and
women, systolic BP was independently associated with an
increased risk of fatal stroke among men and women and
among whites and African Americans. Other BP parame-
ters did not consistently predict fatal stroke. Inclusion of
two BP parameters did not improve model fit versus
models with systolic BP alone.
Our findings complement those from similar studies of
BP parameters and risk of stroke. Bowman and col-
leagues7 observed significant associations between all four

BP PARAMETERS AND RISK OF FATAL STROKE
BP parameters and stroke mortality among 11,467 appar-
ently healthy men from the Physician's Health Study after
a median of approximately 19 years of follow-up (508
stroke deaths). Only systolic BP was consistently associ-
ated with stroke death and models with two BP parameters
did not fit the data better than models with systolic BP
alone. Similar findings were observed for CVD deaths
among 53,163 apparently healthy men from the Physi-
cian's Health Study after a median of nearly 6 years of
follow-up (459 CVD deaths).6 In the 1963 Israeli Ischemic
Heart Disease study that followed 9611 male civil servants
aged 40 to 65 years for approximately 23 years, Weitzman
and Goldbourt5 also observed significant associations be-
tween all four BP parameters and fatal stroke (339 stroke
deaths). Results for models with two BP parameters dif-
fered across normotensive, hypertensive, and isolated sys-
tolic hypertensive strata. For example, systolic BP but not
diastolic BP was a significant predictor of stroke death
among normotensive men, whereas both systolic and dia-
stolic BP were significant predictors among hypertensive
men and men with isolated systolic hypertension. In other
two BP parameter models, PP and diastolic BP were
significant predictors of fatal stroke among normotensive
and hypertensive men, whereas PP and MAP were both
significant predictors of fatal stroke among normotensives
but not hypertensives.
There are several possible explanations for differences
between studies. We used the average of multiple BP
measurements obtained by physicians in a standardized
environment, whereas BP measurements from the Physi-
cian's Health Study were self-reported. We had limited
power to detect a significant effect of BP on risk of fatal
stroke due to a small number of stroke events and we were
unable to stratify on stroke type. It is possible that rela-
tionships between BP parameters and stroke differ by the
type of event (eg, ischemic versus hemorrhagic), although
Bowman and colleagues7 reported similar relationships for
total (RR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.20­1.42), ischemic (1.27;
1.16­1.40), and hemorrhagic (1.38; 1.13­1.68) stroke.
Our study included men and women, whereas the other
studies focused only on men. We included African-Amer-
icans in this analysis; the Physician's Health Study cohort
was predominantly white.14 Finally, collinearity diagnos-
tics indicated possible issues with certain BP parameter
combinations.
In conclusion, results from the NHANES II Mortality
Study agree with those from previous studies and show
that systolic BP is an important risk predictor for fatal
stroke. These relationships were observed among men and
women, as well as among whites and African Americans
and provide further evidence of the need to control systolic
BP in the population.
