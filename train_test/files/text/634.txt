Impact Of Extending Health Care Coverage To The Uninsured
by Mark S. Blumberg
Abstract: Changes in use of health services by the uninsured, when covered after health reform, are
a key to the costs of reform. From data on persons under age sixty-five in the 1989 National Health
Interview Survey, we estimated their expected use of hospitals (excluding obstetric deliveries) and
doctor visits, adjusting for age, sex, and self-reported health status. If uninsured persons obtained
private coverage distributed by the plan type of other persons in their home regions, nonobstetric
hospital days for the formerly uninsured would increase 28 percent, and their visits to physicians'
offices would increase 52 percent. If instead the uninsured enrolled entirely in group- or staff-model
health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in their home regions, their nonobstetric hospital days
would actually decrease 17 percent, and their visits to physicians' offices would increase 60 percent.
One key goal ofhealth system reform is to provide health care coverage
to those who now lack it. Estimating the cost of providing such
coverage is an important policy issue. These estimates depend
greatly on how much the volume of health care services used by the
uninsured would change if they were to enroll in various types of private
health coverage. Obviously, somebody in the system is paying the costs of
care already obtained by the uninsured. If the uninsured were covered, these
costs would appear explicitly instead of remaining hidden. Regional patterns
of health care use also affect the changes in cost incurred when coverage is
extended to the uninsured. However, much of our current knowledge of
relative utilization by persons with various types of private coverage depends
on data gathered ten to twenty years ago. A study based on a more recent
nationally representative sample should provide further insights for policy-
makers on how to resolve this tough issue.
The 1989 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) included a supple-
mentary set of questions that asked for considerable detail on types of
health coverage for the survey population. This information, combined
with the regular NHIS questions concerning health status and use of
physician and hospital services, made it a very promising source of compre-
hensive factual information on the issues mentioned above.
The major objective of this study was to use information from the 1989

NHIS to examine volumes of hospital and physician's office use adjusted for
age, sex, and self-reported health status of the population under age sixty-
five without public coverage, comparing those without private health cov-
erage to those with various types of private health coverage, by region.
Study Methods
The 1989 NHIS sample used for this analysis was made up of 45,711
households containing 116,929 persons.1 The NHIS follows a multistage
probability design; as a consequence, respondents vary in the weight as-
signed to them. The weights in the public-use tapes are adjusted to give
estimates of the 1989 civilian noninstitutional population (243,532,000).
We were more interested in knowing the approximate number of respon-
dents with various characteristics. For this reason we used a deflator for the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)-assigned weights, which
was equal to the U.S. population (243,532,000) divided by the total num-
ber of respondents (116,929), or 2,082.734. We then divided the NCHS
weights by this constant (2,082.734), which preserved the relative weight
for each respondent due to the sampling procedure.
We omitted all persons age sixty-five and older, because their health
insurance status is dominated by Medicare in combination with other
public and private coverage, and all respondents who had any public
coverage. We grouped the relatively small number of persons with no
private coverage at the time of the survey who had Medicaid at any time in
the prior six months with those having public coverage. This left a study
population made up of persons with either private coverage only or no
coverage, public or private.
All who responded to questions on their health care coverage were asked
to name the plan or plans covering them. Each respondent also was asked if
his or her plan was "an HMO," based upon the following brief description:
"Health Maintenance Organizations, or HMOs, sometimes called Individ-
ual Practice Associations, or IPAs, are plans whose members are required to
use only those health care providers who work for the HMO or IPA. Also,
members do not have to submit claims for costs of medical care services."
As part of the development of the public-use tapes, the NCHS recoded
each of the plans named by respondents against a master list distinguishing
group- or staff-model HMOs from IPAs. In this study, those with a plan
identified by name as a group- or staff-model plan or an IPA were coded
accordingly. However, persons who said that they were in an HMO but
gave plan names that could not be identified were classified as being in
"other HMOs." About 90 percent of those with plan names confirmed as
IPAs or group/staff-model HMOs had correctly stated that they were in an

HMO. We do not know much about the plan characteristics of people
classified as being in "other HMOs," but these plans are less likely to be
large or long-established plans with well-known names.
The other (non-HMO) types of private insurance were divided into
those described as "Blues" and "other private." The latter was the largest
category and included self-insured plans offered by employers, labor and
welfare trust plans, and commercial indemnity plans. An HMO plan owned
by Blue Cross and Blue Shield or a commercial insurance company was
classified as an HMO based on the specific plan name.
About 10-15 percent of those with some private coverage indicated that
they had more than one type of private coverage. We prioritized such
persons in the following order: group/staff-model, IPA, other HMO, Blues,
and other coverage. Those with no private coverage were designated as "no
coverage," since this analysis is limited to those with no public coverage.2
The weighted sample size used in this study totaled 90,668, representing
89,771 actual respondents (Exhibit 1). More than 40 percent of the group/
staff-model sample was in the West, while 36 percent of the Blues sample
was in the Northeast. About 44 percent of the "no coverage" sample was in
the South. These uneven regional distributions highlight the problems that
can arise from using aggregate national data to estimate the changes in costs
of providing coverage to the uninsured.
In our analysis of hospital use we omitted obstetric deliveries for several
reasons. Nearly all deliveries occur in hospitals, and hence there is virtually
one hospital discharge for each delivery. The propensity to have a baby is
certainly influenced by age and sex, but the relative utilization rate of
hospital episodes per delivery is essentially the same for all populations and
is influenced little by self-reported health status. Obstetric deliveries in this
study population accounted for 19.4 percent of all of their reported annual
hospital discharges. To enlarge on the number of deliveries, we used those

under age two (3.13 percent of the study population) as a proxy for births in
the prior two years.3
There is great variation in crude birth rates (measured by this proxy) by
region and by coverage type. Our data also exclude well (but not sick)
newborn admissions. This, however, still leaves other hospitalizations re-
lated to pregnancy, such as those for some miscarriages, ectopic pregnan-
cies, false labors, postpartum complications, and sick newborns. The omis-
sion of obstetric deliveries only partially adjusts for risks of hospitalization
related to pregnancy and newborns. (Our measure of use of physician
services includes all office care related to pregnancy and newborns.)
We analyzed the following measures of utilization: (1) Hospital: episodes
of care with at least one night in the hospital, with the patient discharged
at some time in the year prior to the interview (excluding discharges for
obstetric delivery and well newborns); and number of hospital days for
these nondelivery episodes. (2) Visit to physician's office: number of per-
sons reporting at least one office visit in the past year; and number of visits
reported by the respondent in the year prior to the interview.
The basic method of analysis here is indirect standardization. In all
examples, standards for expected rates were based on the aggregate experi-
ence of the entire population under age sixty-five without public coverage
(the 90,668 weighted persons). We divided this population into eight age
and two sex categories, and into four self-reported health status groups.
A few respondents had very long short-term hospital stays, which could
have had a disproportionate impact on any cell in the standard in which
they occurred. For this reason we truncated the number of hospital days per
person according to the number of hospital episodes the person had re-
ported in the prior year. The following tabulation shows the total number
of hospital days allowed by the number of episodes the person had in the
prior year: One discharge, 45 days; two discharges, 70 days; three discharges,
90 days; four discharges, 105 days; and five or more discharges, 115 days.
Overall, this truncation reduced the total volume of hospital days for this
study group less than 5 percent.
Similar but separate tables were prepared to obtain expected values for
the number of nondelivery hospital discharges in the prior year, the number
of doctor visits in the year prior to the interview, and the proportion with
at least one doctor visit in the prior year.
Study Results
Persons with no coverage had by far the highest expected hospital days
rate in each region and overall (Exhibit 2). Nationally, the Blues had the
highest expected value of the categories with private health coverage. But

note the interregional differences. For example, in the West the Blues had
the lowest expected value of persons with private health coverage. The
highest expected value of any cell was for persons in the South with no
coverage. The South also had the highest expected value overall
Adjustment for only age and sex gave the lowest expected value to those
with no coverage, indicating that they were young, while the adjustment
including health status indicated that they had the worst self-reported
health status on an age/sex-specific basis. By region, using age/sex adjust-
ment only, the Northeast had the highest expected value, but it had the
lowest expected value with health status included. This implies an older but
healthier population in the Northeast.
Exhibit 3 gives the indirectly standardized ratio (observed to expected)
of nondelivery hospital discharges, lengths-of-stay, and hospital days, by
region and by type of coverage. The length-of-stay values were derived from
the discharge and days data. For discharges, group/staff models had the
lowest ratio of any of the types of private coverage. Interregional differences
by type of coverage also exist. The ratio for the Blues in the West was
considerably lower than the ratios for the Blues in other regions, pointing
out the danger of drawing conclusions based on aggregate national data.
The middle panel of Exhibit 3 shows the indirectly standardized ratios for
nondelivery hospital lengths-of-stay, with a U.S. standard of 5.45 days per
discharge. The West had the lowest ratio of any region, although the South
was almost as low. Those with no coverage had the highest ratio, with the
Blues nearly as high. Group/staff models had the lowest ratio.
For nondelivery hospital days, group/staff models had the lowest ratio,
because of their relatively short lengtlvof-stay ratios and their low discharge
ratios. Among those with any private coverage, group/staff models also had

the lowest ratio of observed to expected nondelivery hospital days in each
region. Those with no coverage also had a low ratio, but this was the result
of a very low discharge ratio and an above-average length-of-stay ratio. This
is consistent with the view that those without coverage may forgo more
admissions for elective surgery than for emergencies.
Our physician's visit variable is dependent on the number of visits
reported by each respondent for the year prior to the survey interview.
These visits also included telephone contacts and office contacts with staff,
such as nurses. Visits took place not only in private doctors' offices but also
in emergency rooms, freestanding clinics, and outpatient departments.
Visits included checkups for pregnancy, and others for women of childbear-
ing years, plus those for well newborns and other infants, but they excluded
the large volume of physician services provided to hospital inpatients.
Physician inpatient utilization patterns should be closer to a blend of
hospital discharges and hospital days, as shown in Exhibit 3, rather than the

results for doctor visits, which follow.
Exhibit 4 shows the indirectly standardized ratio of doctor visits with
expected values based on age, sex, and self-reported health status. There is
little difference in the ratio of observed to expected visits by type of private
coverage, but, not surprisingly, those with no coverage had a low ratio
(0.808). The annual number of doctor visits was truncated at fifty (that is,
persons with more than fifty visits were recoded as having fifty visits). The
indirectly standardized ratio of observed to expected annual visits is under
0.8 in each region for those with no coverage. Overall differences in the
ratio by type of private coverage are small.
We can now use the data presented above to estimate the changes in
hospital and doctor visit use that are likely to occur if those without private
coverage are given private coverage. This requires assumptions about the
types of health coverage that the uninsured would obtain. We also assume
that uninsured persons residing in a given region would obtain their private
coverage in plans available in their home region, which should be obvious.
A person without coverage in the South could hardly be expected to enroll
in an HMO in the Northeast, or even an average U.S. HMO. Our key
assumption is that an uninsured person obtaining private coverage of a
particular type would have a utilization pattern similar to that of persons
already covered by this type of plan in the region in which the uninsured

person resides. This assumption is arguable, since those without coverage
differ in many respects from those with coverage. For this reason, the
estimates presented below may be improved by further adjustments for
income, education, race, employment, and marital status, as well as for
other health status factors that may influence utilization.
Exhibit 5 illustrates different assumptions about the types of coverage
that persons without private coverage might obtain in the future. In all
three examples we assume that persons without private coverage enroll in
private plans in the same region in which they reside. First, we assume that
all persons without private coverage in the South enroll in "other private"
plans in the South. If they had the same utilization patterns of persons
already in "other private" plans in the South, then their risk-adjusted
nondelivery hospital days ratio would be 1.116, instead of the 0.847 those
without private coverage in the South have (Exhibit 3). The ratio of 1.116
to 0.847 is 1.32, the number that appears in the hospital days column on
the top line of figures in Exhibit 5. If all persons with no private coverage in
the South enrolled in "other private" plans in the South, their nondelivery
hospital days would increase 32 percent. The values in other sections of
Exhibit 5 were derived from earlier exhibits, and they can be interpreted in
the same way as the foregoing example.
The middle section of Exhibit 5 assumes that those with no private

coverage all enroll in group/staff-model HMOs in their "home" regions. In
the South, for example, nondelivery hospital days equal 0.60, which implies
that under this assumption hospital days for persons not now privately
insured would decline 40 percent;hospital discharges would decline 22
percent. Doctor visits under this assumption would increase 73 percent.
Comparable data for the Northeast, Midwest, and West similarly assume
that residents of these three regions enroll in group/staff-model HMOs in
the region in which they reside. In these three additional regions there
would be little change in use of nondelivery hospital days by the uninsured
but substantial increases in their doctor visits. National data are calculated
by weighting each of the index numbers by the percentage of the U.S.
population located in each region. Nationally, having persons without
insurance join group/staff-model HMOs in their respective regions would
increase their hospital discharges by 2 percent, lower their use of hospital
days by 17 percent, and increase their doctor visits by 60 percent.
The lowest section of Exhibit 5 uses the assumption that persons with no
private coverage in each region will join plans in their region in proportion
to those who are already enrolled in plans of each type within their region.
Nationally, this assumption would lead to a 50 percent increase in hospital
discharges, a 28 percent increase in nondelivery hospital days, and a 52
percent increase in doctor visits for those without private insurance. From
a similar calculation that considered the entire United States as one region,
the resulting ratio was 1.36 for hospital days and 1.53 for doctor visits.
Thus, the more realistic assumption that those with no coverage will use
care like those in their home regions (as in the lowest section of Exhibit 5)
gave results that differed from the more typical assumption, which ignores
the regions in which the uninsured live.
As noted before, there are no data here to estimate the volume of
physician services rendered to inpatients. This volume is more likely to be
between the estimates developed for nondelivery hospital days and dis-
charges than to be similar to doctor visits.
The per birth volume of hospital care for obstetric and well newborn
services delivered to uninsured persons is unlikely to change much if the
uninsured obtain private coverage. The data on doctor visits already in-
clude visits relating to pregnancy and well newborns and probably account
for part of the increase in such use that we have estimated above.
Discussion
A recent paper compared the physician office use of those with and
without insurance using the 1989 NHIS.4 However, this paper made no
distinctions by type of private coverage. Another study, this one by Lewin-

VHI, was closer to ours in purpose and use of the 1989 NHIS.5 The study's
authors assumed that "use of health services for . . . [the uninsured] will
increase under managed competition to levels reported by insured persons
with similar age, sex, income, and self-reported health status charac-
teristics." Using this approach, they estimated that the costs of care for the
uninsured after provision of private insurance would increase 56 percent for
hospital inpatient care and 117 percent for hospital emergency room/
outpatient and physician services. This is about double the increase we
derived in our estimates (Exhibit 5). They also estimated from their NHIS
data that "on average, [all types of] HMOs reduce utilization by 2 percent
(versus 8 percent for group models)." This reduction for group models is
much less than our data for group/staff-model HMOs. The small increase
we found for doctor visits, shown in Exhibits 3 and 4, should not be used to
estimate changes in physician inpatient care costs.
A third study, done by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), led to
the assumption that group/staff-model HMO care would reduce spending
for persons with private or public coverage (exclusive of Medicare or
Medicaid) by 15 percent over programs with no managed care.6 This
estimated reduction also appears to be low, but the CBO assumptions were
not based on a risk-adjusted database comparable to the NHIS.
Neither the Lewin-VHI nor the CBO papers apparently considered
regional differences in health care use and private health coverage. While
the causes of such regional differences are not well understood, they have
persisted since at least the 1950s. Hence, any forecasts need to include some
assumption about whether or not these differences will persist. If there is
interregional convergence, one will have to decide whether it will be
toward the national average or, as seems more probable, toward the regions
with the lowest utilization rates.
Two other studies have developed regression models of hospital and
doctor use based on the 1989 NHIS data for those under age sixty-five. A
1992 Lewin-VHI study estimated the additional use associated with giving
the uninsured private coverage.7 (It is not clear whether this report was the
basis for the estimates given above for Lewin-VHI.) They distinguished
HMOs from other private plans. Their results are somewhat similar to ours
but difficult to compare because they have separate models for those under
age eighteen and those ages eighteen to sixty-four. Regions were included
among the many prediction variables. A 1993 study also estimated the
difference in doctor visits and hospital use of the uninsured and insured
populations under age sixty-five.8 No distinctions about type of private
insurance were made, nor was any geographic variable included as a risk
factor in these regression models. However, both reports provide many
useful insights for researchers and policymakers interested in this subject.

DATAWATCH 191
The utilization data given here are only one component of the cost of
health care. Comparisons of utilization volume can avoid distortions al-
leged to be the result of the greater ability of some plans to shift costs.9 In
addition, utilization data avoid interregional differences in costs that are
the result of variations in factor prices. Compared with studies that are
based upon claims from insurers, this analysis gives more complete doctor
visit utilization data, regardless of whether or not a claim was made. Utili-
zation, from claims experience also is distorted by persons with overlapping
coverage. This analysis includes all of the utilization for members enrolled
in various plans, regardless of who paid for it. Thus, the data are not biased
by use of "out-of-plan" services. These advantages are traded for the greater
detail of services found in claims data.
This analysis updates an earlier study of hospital use by type of coverage
based upon the 1975 NHIS, which was limited to populations under age
sixty-five in western metropolitan statistical areas but lacked some of the
detail on type of coverage that is available in the present study.10 However,
the types of private coverage were somewhat simpler in 1975, which pre-
ceded the rapid growth of a variety of managed care programs. The earlier
study adjusted not only for age and sex but also for various measures of
disease-specific morbidity, which should be even more accurate than the
generic morbidity measure used in this study (self-reported health status).
The NHIS tapes of 1989 do provide the opportunity of making more
disease- or condition-specific adjustments, although the sample sizes are
somewhat limited for the various chronic diseases. Furthermore, the 1989
NHIS provides information on surgical procedures performed in both in-
patient and outpatient settings, which would be a useful adjunct to the
information on hospital episodes and days and doctor visits analyzed in this
DataWatch. Doctor visits can be further disaggregated into visits for sick-
ness and injury and visits for checkups or preventive services.
Self-reported health status is well correlated with both hospital and
doctor use and is certainly an improvement over age and sex risk adjust-
ment alone. However, there is at least a good likelihood that a person's
perception of health status is an interaction between objectively measured
morbidity and various cultural, educational, and attitudinal factors.11
Although self-assessed health status was a useful risk adjustment variable
related to morbidity in this analysis, we do not recommend its use to assess
risks for insurance rate setting or budgeting. Not only is it expensive to
obtain adequately high, unbiased response rates, but there is no way to
verify the information. The context in which it is sought could bias respon-
dents (for example, respondents who fear that poorer health status would
decrease their opportunity for coverage might deliberately misreport it).
Risk adjustment for insurance and budget purposes should rely on the

actual incidence of some well-recorded high-volume conditions not influ-
enced by medical care (such as pregnancy) supplemented by objective
markers for selected costly chronic diseases (such as persons using insulin or
other agents to control diabetes).
The reasons for the diverse apparent risk-adjusted utilization patterns of
different types of plans and different regions should of course be pursued.
One could ask whether the diverse patterns stemmed from differences in
incentives of the various types of coverage, or the experience and compe-
tence of plan practitioners or management. Local variations in practice
patterns and health status variations not adequately adjusted in this analysis
also may contribute to these large area variations.
In any event, the assumptions made about the types of coverage that the
currently uninsured will have in the future are an important factor in
estimating the change in costs of providing them with coverage.
