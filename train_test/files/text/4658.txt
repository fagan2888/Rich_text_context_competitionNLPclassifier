Commentary
Big Data from the bottom up
Nick Couldry and Alison Powell
Abstract
This short article argues that an adequate response to the implications for governance raised by `Big Data' requires much
more attention to agency and reflexivity than theories of `algorithmic power' have so far allowed. It develops this through
two contrasting examples: the sociological study of social actors used of analytics to meet their own social ends (for
example, by community organisations) and the study of actors' attempts to build an economy of information more open
to civic intervention than the existing one (for example, in the environmental sphere). The article concludes with a
consideration of the broader norms that might contextualise these empirical studies, and proposes that they can be
understood in terms of the notion of voice, although the practical implementation of voice as a norm means that voice
must sometimes be considered via the notion of transparency.

Introduction
We are living through a transformation of governance ­
both its mechanisms and reference-points ­ which is
likely to have profound implications for practical pro-
cesses of government and everyday understandings of
the social world. A shift is under way from discrete
forms of intervention in social space based on intermit-
tent and/or specific information-gathering to continu-
ous processes of management based on total and
unremitting surveillance (Ruppert, 2011). Both man-
agement and government increasingly are becoming
predicated upon the continuous gathering and analysis
of dynamically collected, individual-level data about
what people are, do and say (`Big Data'). However mis-
leading or mythical some narratives around Big Data
(Boyd and Crawford, 2011; Couldry, 2013), the actual
processes of data-gathering, data-processing and
organisational adjustment associated with such narra-
tives are not mythical; they constitute an important, if
highly contested, `fact' with which all social actors must
deal. This article will offer a social approach to the
construction and use of such data and related analytics.
The possibility of such a social approach to Big Data
has, until now, been obscured by unnecessarily general-
ised readings of the consequences of these broad
changes. Without a doubt, the information types that
management and governance take as their starting-
point have changed: it is digital infrastructures of col-
lection, transmission, analysis and presentation that
have made possible continuous data-mining.
Compared to representative sampling, such new
approaches to data collection are totalising; they are
also characterised by the aggregation of multiple data
sets through the use of calculation algorithms. This
seemingly increased role for algorithms has led some
commentators to focus on the dominance of `algorith-
mic power' (Lash, 2007), an approach that leaves no
room for agency or reflexivity on the part of `smaller'
actors. We posit that emerging cultures of data collec-
tion deserve to be examined in a way that foregrounds
the agency and reflexivity of individual actors as well as
the variable ways in which power and participation are
constructed and enacted.

This more agent-focused inquiry into the conse-
quences of algorithmic calculation's deep embedding
in everyday life has been foreshadowed in some earlier
debates, notably Beer's (2009) response to Lash's (2007)
argument that `algorithmic power' has changed the
nature of hegemony. As Beer (2009: 999) noted, soci-
ology must also `focus . . . on those who engage with the
software in their everyday lives'. Such a focus does not
come naturally within Lash's broadly philosophical for-
mulations of issues in social theory which foreground `a
collapse of ontology and epistemology' (Lash, 2006:
581), and a new power-laden regime of `facticity'
(Lash, 2007: 56) in which `there is no time, nor space
. . . for reflection' (Lash, 2002: 18). If that were right,
why pay close attention to what actors say when they
`reflect' on their position in the social world? But this
analytic closure is unhelpful.
Needed instead is a more open enquiry into what
actual social actors, and groups of actors, are doing
under these conditions in a variety of places and set-
tings. Without denying of course the `generative'
importance of algorithms (Lash, 2007: 71) when
embedded in modes of calculation, processing and
rule, we need to remember that social actors are often
themselves aware of being classified. Even if they are
not privy to the details of when, by whom, and how
they have been classified, that this has happened is
something of which they are aware, and indeed one of
the main `facts' they have to deal with as social actors.
We need to become sensitive to what Beer (2009: 998)
has called people's `classificatory imagination' and,
over the longer term, the wider `social imaginaries'
(Mansell, 2012; Taylor, 2005) that may be emerging
around these new cultures of data collection.
Beer goes on helpfully to distinguish three levels of
resulting empirical research: first, regarding the
`organizations that establish and activate Web 2.0
applications'; second, regarding the `software infra-
structures and their applications on the web'; and
third, regarding how the first two levels `play out in
the lives of those that use (or do not use) particular
web applications' (2009: 998). We would like in this
short article to build particularly on Beer's third level,
and on the lessons of our own empirical researches, to
map out some more detailed and concrete ways of
researching the everyday uses of data and analytics
from a social perspective. The result is to open up a
much wider and more varied space of agency and
reflexivity than allowed for in philosophical accounts.
The likely outcome may be no less critical of Big
Data's implications, but will develop critique through
a more nuanced characterisation of `Big Data' as a
variegated space of action, albeit one very different
from the spaces in which pre-digital social actors
operated.
Doing social analytics
Our first example of a more agent-focused account of
Big Data is what has been called `social analytics' (see
Couldry et al., forthcoming, for a much more detailed
account). A social analytics approach is an explicitly
sociological treatment of how analytics get used by a
range of social actors. Such an approach aims to cap-
ture how particular actors reflect upon, and adjust,
their online presence and the actions that feed into it,
through the use of `analytics'. `Analytics' here is used
broadly to cover both basic analytics (the automated
measurement and counting installed within the oper-
ation of digital platforms and associated websites,
apps and tools) and the adjustments made by actors
themselves in response to such measurement and count-
ing operations. Platforms that count and sort online
data, such as Google and Facebook, work automatic-
ally via algorithms, often allowing users only limited
degrees of manual adjustment (van Dijck, 2013).
Other adjustments around those operations may take
direct digital form (a website redesign) or organisa-
tional form (an adjustment in an organisation's man-
agement of its resources). In all these cases, the variable
use of analytics is a social process involving reflection,
monitoring and adjustment.
By `social actors' we mean actors with social ends
over and above the basic aim of generating and analys-
ing data (usually for profit): that basic aim in itself is of
little sociological interest. The broader sociological
interest starts when there is some tension, actual or
potential, between the aims that social actors are
trying to achieve and the interpretations of their activ-
ities that analytics generate. This use of the term `social
analytics' encompasses, but goes beyond, the everyday
`technical' use of the term `analytics' to mean the meas-
urement and reporting of internet data. The mutual
intertwining of human and material agency is hardly
a new insight (Pickering, 1995: 15­20), but it acquires
a special interest when analytics' operations are opaque
to non-expert social actors who must work hard to
acquire control over them.
One key variable in such research is what is mea-
sured and analysed, the `object' of analytics. The under-
lying data's relationship to an organisation's online
presence may be more or less direct: direct if the data
is literally about that organisation's online presence
(numbers of unique users, their characteristics, types
of interaction with online content); or indirect if the
data is not about an organisation's online presence,
but is generated or presented online, becoming part of
how that organisation is judged by online visitors
(online reviews, debates). The closeness, or distance,
of the relation between the object of data analysis
and the general aims and practice of social actors
2 Big Data & Society
clearly will shape the degree of tension and reflexivity
that exists over the implementation of analytics. At one
end of the spectrum will be cases where analytics are
used directly to support other mechanisms of power
(e.g. performance management); at the other end will
be cases where what is at stake in the use of analytics is
the broad redefinition of an organisation's aims and
performance, with no direct impact on the evaluation
or management of individuals. In the former case,
social analytics may merge into the study of manage-
ment and power; in the latter case, social analytics may
be something closer to a phenomenology of how social
actors and organisations with social aims appear to
themselves, and to the world, under digital conditions.
Other variables when doing social analytics will
include the degree of technical expertise of the actors
involved, including the degree to which they can go
beyond merely using off-the-shelf analytics to customis-
ing them, or perhaps even developing their own ana-
lytic tools and data-collection designs. Financial and
other resources will also affect how far the processes
which social analytics studies can develop, or get
blocked, for example, if the staff to do the analytic
work that would enable a richer re-evaluation of an
organisation's digital presence cease to be available.
Expertise and resources are, of course, variables in
any fieldwork setting.
Within these basic parameters, however, social ana-
lytics promise a rich vein of inquiry into the conditions
of data use and analytics use, from the perspective of
social actors who are not principally experts in relation
to data or algorithms, but who look to them to do cer-
tain work towards other ends. It has so far been explored
in the context of community and civic activism, but it has
the potential to be expanded to many more areas.
Data as media
For media scholars more generally, the shift to a data-
rich environment poses challenges for a robust under-
standing of how agency and expression might still work
within that environment. The critical tradition in media
and communications has largely been concerned with
the operation of power in the construction of systems of
symbolic mediation ­ for example, the function of ideo-
logical systems (in the Marxist tradition) or the
Gramscian concept of hegemony. These strategies
have allowed media and communication scholars to
`work backwards' through systems of symbolic medi-
ation in order to understand the process and initial
starting points of mediated `messages'. This focus on
the symbolic quality of media messages allows us to
examine power relationships from several different
vantage points. Within traditional broadcast media
forms we can observe how the symbolic control of
mediated messages solidifies control and results in
things like propaganda, but we can also see how alter-
native media producers can wrest control of ideas
and their representation to challenge that kind of
hegemony.
Broadcast models have however been overtaken,
for important purposes, by models of mass self-
communication. Whereas institutionalised mass media
is structured to disseminate messages from one to
many, mass self-communication is structured to invite
continual input of data by individuals. This reorganisa-
tion of media production initially seemed to promise a
reconfiguration of the top-down production of ideology
and the bottom-up resistance to it, but as political­
economic analyses have developed, we are beginning
to see how such shifts have also led to the production
of data replacing the production of audiences.
If the exemplary product of institutionalised mass
media is propaganda, the exemplary product of mass
self-communication is data. A mass media apparatus
requests information to be disseminated from the one
to the many; its economic model uses this information
to generate an audience whose attention can be sold to
an advertiser. In the mass self-communication model
individuals are still part of an aggregate product to be
sold, but instead of their attention on a single message
produced for broadcast, it is their individual acts of
communication that comprise the `Big Data' and
drive much media value-extraction.
Early critics of mass self-communication noted that
the model encouraged individuals to create `content'
that was then sold to others in order to capture their
attention (Terranova, 2000; van Dijck, 2013). However,
`content' is still expressive, even when it is sold to cap-
ture attention. A more complicated issue concerns the
data that is produced, often unwittingly, which now
generates much of the value in the newest iteration of
the contribution economy. Many everyday activities
now produce data without requiring human meaning-
construction (or even basic consent). The rise of sensor
networks has meant that increasingly individuals
are producing not `content' composed of messages con-
taining intrinsic or constructed meaning, but mere data
­ temperature readings, status updates, location coord-
inates, tracks, traces and check-ins. Not one of these
individual data-types is necessarily meaningful in itself
­ but taken together, either through aggregation, cor-
relation or calculation, such data provide large
amounts of information. The difference between this
and the `content' that mass self-communication prom-
ises to distribute is that the meaning of data is made not
semantically (through expression and interpretation)
but through processing ­ especially the matching
of metadata (Boellstorf, 2013). Big Data sets are
composed of numerous pieces of information that can
Couldry and Powell 3
be cross-compared, aggregated and disaggregated and
made very finely grained, not things whose creators
necessarily endowed with meaning. In mining the
data, more insights are made available about more
aspects of everyday life but no opportunity is provided
for these insights to be folded back into the experience
of everyday life. In this context, is there any scope, as
Boellstorf urges, for integrating the epistemic perspec-
tives of ethnography back into the calculative logic of
meta-data?
All along, the political economy of personal data, as
anticipated by Gandy (1993), has been concerned with
value created through the aggregation and calculation
of individual traces. Even if we leave aside the expres-
sive quality of individual acts of communication online,
the production of data as a by-product of everyday life
practices enacts a particular political economics of
media, undertaken within a situation of pervasive sur-
veillance and generalised authoritarianism (Cohen
2012). But the potential disconnect between system
and experience, phenomenology and political economy,
can be overcome by examining on the ground agents'
strategies for building alternative economies of infor-
mation. Such alternative economies are being devel-
oped in several areas related to environment and
sustainability, including projects that use data sources
to make provenance and supply chains visible, and
those that encourage individuals and communities to
collect data as a means to make environmental issues
visible by challenging conventional data collection.
Academic projects like Wikichains (Graham, 2010)
and start-up companies like Provenance.it (2013) aggre-
gate various forms of data about the production,
distribution and supply chains of manufactured objects
as a means of drawing attention to their long-term
ecological and economic costs. While Provenance.it
remains anchored in a consumer-based economic
model, it does illustrate how alternative modes of
data collection and analysis could shift agency and rep-
resentation, especially if it permitted for greater reflex-
ivity. Similarly, NGOs like Mapping for Change (2013)
have supported individuals and community groups in
gathering environmental data (like air quality and
noise) as a means of engaging with gaps and flaws in
official data. These actions intervene in efforts to use
such environmental data within top-down governance
processes. As Gabrys (2014) identifies, such citizen sci-
ence efforts must be enfolded and imagined in processes
of environmental governance or `biopolitics 2.0'. These
examples illustrate two ways that an alternative eco-
nomics of information might employ calculation of
multiple data sources or generation of alternative
sources to illustrate or critique power relations,
although they also illustrate the ambiguity of account-
ability within these processes.
Voice, transparency and power
The rise of analytics presents a significant normative
challenge for scholars, activists and others who seek
to understand how humanity, sociability and experi-
ence are represented. The daily practices of grappling
with data and with the consequences of data analyses
generate new questions about what and whose power
gets exercised through such practices, and to what
degree such exercises of power are satisfactorily made
accountable. One approach to these challenges is
through attention to problems of voice (Couldry,
2010). Voice, understood as a value for social organisa-
tion (Couldry, 2010: ch. 1), involves taking into account
agents' practices of giving an account of themselves and
their conditions of life. The value of voice is essential to
the workings of any models so far developed of demo-
cratic institutions, but it is not immediately compatible
with a world saturated with the automated aggregation
of analytic mechanisms that are not, even in principle,
open to any continuous human interpretation or
review.
While the notion of voice insists upon organisational
processes being accountable to the subjectivities and
expressiveness of all, the movement towards more
casual, automatic sensing and its calculative rather
than epistemic logic seems to eliminate this account-
ability. Yet clearly something similar to `voice' is
required in this new world, and this is not just a
matter of democracy: `we have no idea', wrote Paul
Ricoeur, `what a culture would be where no one any
longer knew what it meant to narrate things' (Couldry,
2010: 1, quoting Ricoeur, 1984: 29). At present, the
proxy for voice in the algorithmic domain is the
notion that data gathering processes ought to be trans-
parent, and the logic of calculation revealed. A focus on
transparency could begin to foreground notions of
accountability in data calculation, ownership and use.
Notions of transparency have been discussed with
respect to government production and use of data
(Tkacz, 2012). Yet despite pledging to make public
data collection transparent, governments like the US
and the UK in fact collect much more information
via surveillance projects and partnerships with informa-
tion technology companies. With the reform of the
USA's National Security Administration, perhaps
more attention will begin to be paid to the data collec-
tion practices of the technology sector, making more of
them visible. This kind of transparency goes part of the
way to establishing accountability, but it still fails to
address accountability and reflexivity. A refined
concept of transparency that is sensitive to the
meaning that data trails might form (even if it cannot
be sensitive to the meaning inherent in their produc-
tion) might go some way to addressing this. This is a
4 Big Data & Society
tricky proposal: unless and until the unconscious pro-
duction of data can be conceived of as a form of expres-
sion, the philosophical basis for such an expansive
transparency will be difficult to establish. One possible
way to proceed might be to highlight not just the risks
of creating and sharing data but the opportunities as
well. The practices of social analytics and citizen science
have the potential to establish these opportunities,
ambiguous as they may be.
We hope that, as the debates about Big Data and
society continue and their democratic stakes become
clearer, the values implicit in the terms `voice' and
`transparency' will themselves begin to converge in
more satisfying ways than are at present possible.
