Introduction
The persistence of poverty, the high rate of educational fail-
ure, and the absence of meaningful "development" among
peasants/peasantry in post-independence Zimbabwe neces-
sitate an imperative search for an explanation. Considering
that peasants constitute more than three quarters of the coun-
try's population (Moyo & Yeros, 2011; Sadomba, 2011), one
discerns the exploitation of these generally simple and law-
abiding citizens by the state and its corporate allies. Given
the apparent absence of a theory to explain the under-class
predicament of peasantry children in higher education, the
article uses internal colonial insights and analytics to address
the crisis in higher education (unaffordable fees, high drop-
out, concentration in disciplines that lead to low pay, poor
living conditions, etc.; see Students Solidarity Trust, 2009)
of children from peasant background. The article will dem-
onstrate how the political, economic, and social conditions
of peasant children since the year 2000 are essentially colo-
nial. The use of the internal colonial perspective, despite its
vagueness and lack of clear universally agreed definition
(Wolpe, 1975) is deliberately meant to initiate and stir a
debate on perennial educational inequalities and under-
achievement of students of peasant upbringing.
Contemporary educational policies in sub-Saharan
African countries, such as Zimbabwe, have been perceived
as geared toward the promotion of Western values and not
local cultures. Summative national examinations at Grade 7,
Form 4 (equivalent to Grade 11) and Form 6 (which could be
the equivalent of Grade 13/university entrance level) consis-
tently indicate that students from rural schools struggle and
underperform (Mbanje, 2012) and consequently affecting
those who get access into university education and what
degree programs one enrolls into. The objective of this arti-
cle is to utilize the thesis of internal colonialism to analyze
the educational underachievement of students of peasantry
background in Zimbabwe. The article uses anti-colonial per-
spectives and critics that unmask modern hegemonic forces
and refuses the notion that colonialism ended with the attain-
ment of national independence (Escobar, 2004; Fanon, 1963;
Mignolo, 2000; Quijano, 2000) to
a. describe the living and learning conditions of students
from peasantry background;
b. examine the education experience of rural peasants in
Zimbabwe and expose how it is structured in a way
that reproduces the peasantry as an under-class; and

Education of the Peasantry in Zimbabwe
as Internal Colonialism
Munyaradzi Hwami1
Abstract
This article utilizes internal colonial analyses to explore and understand the difficult educational conditions students from
peasantry background experience in Zimbabwe's universities. The article proposes that the subordinate position and related
educational experiences of peasantry students since the year 2000 are exploitative and to the advantage of the elite to
such an extent that peasants are an internal colony. The analysis is informed by critical anti-colonial perspectives that
observe the hegemonic tendencies of global and local capital in collusion with dictatorial elite nationalists. By use of a critical
interpretive case study of purposefully sampled students and other relevant members of the university community from
one public university, disturbing student experiences were excavated. Student narratives and experiences were analyzed
using the constant comparative method and led to the conclusion that there is internal colonialism in Zimbabwe where
an alliance of the state and the local and global corporate world are colluding to maintain their economic and political
dominance. The article challenges those in education and academics that there is need for the decolonization of education
by first identifying contemporary hegemonic forces and recognizing students from the peasantry as victims of the emerging
kleptocratic capitalism.

c. assess the experiences of university students from peas-
antry background in the context of contemporary strug-
gles against national and global hegemonic forces.
Different forms of domination and exploitation have con-
tinued to be manufactured by those with political and eco-
nomic capital, and alliances of the elite are continuously
formed that are intended to maintain hegemonic political
economies at the expense of the vulnerable groups such as
peasants. The analysis in this article is therefore in the con-
text of research sensibilities that critique the structures of
elite nationalist capitalism and neo-colonial Western racial
and class hegemony (Apple, 2009; Denzin & Lincoln, 2008)
with the explicit objective of contributing toward what
Quijano (2007) terms "epistemological decolonization or
decoloniality" (p. 177) or "decolonization/deconstruction as
a critic of Western hegemonic constructions" (Mignolo,
2000, p. 323). The scholarly analysis aims to expose the
internal colonial nature of the peasant situation by address-
ing the immizerating conditions of their children in
universities.
It is widely shared that "internal colonialism" (Blauner,
1969, p. 394; Calvert, 2001, p. 52; Casanova, 1965, p. 27;
Epstein, 1971, p. 188; Wolpe, 1975, p. 229) entails that
"components of the normal imperial-colonial relations are to
be found within the borders of a single state" (Wolpe, 1975,
p. 229) and is characterized by "the use of state power by one
section of society (the Control Centre) to impose unfavour-
able rates of exchange on another part of society (the subor-
dinate remotes)" (Gouldner, 1978, p. 13). A structured
relationship of domination and subordination is established
or maintained to serve the interests of all or part of the domi-
nant group (Gouldner, 1978; Gutiérrez, 2004; Hind, 1984;
Hughes, 1995; Love, 1989; Welch, 1988). "In internal colo-
nisation, the analogue of the colonial power is an elite and
not a country" (Calvert, 2001, p. 54) and this elite or "core is
seen to dominate the periphery politically and to exploit it
materially" (Hechter, 1975, p. 9). These internal or domestic
colonial relationships have been observed and analyzed
along race/ethnic perspectives in the New World, with
Gutiérrez (2004) labeling it an American theory of race,
widely employed by many to explain and understand the
perennial under-class status of Afro-Americans in the United
States of America (Blauner, 1969;Calderon-Zaks, 2006;
Hind, 1984).Asimilar framework has been utilized to expose
the continued existence of underdevelopment among indig-
enous groups in settler nations such as Australia, Canada,
and New Zealand (Hughes, 1995; Welch, 1988) and as a cri-
tique of the racist separate development of apartheid South
Africa (Wolpe, 1975).
Review of Literature: The Peasantry as
an Internal Colony
Any definition of peasants generally should be according to
their form of production. Peasants are traditionally defined
as people involved in agriculture and have direct access to
the production of their means of subsistence (Araghi, 1995).
This may or may not involve direct ownership, although for
Marx it was ownership that fundamentally separated peas-
ants from the proletariat (Archetti & Aass, 1978). What is
definitive about the peasant form of production is that,
regardless of ownership, the logic of production is subsis-
tence. Henry Bernstein (1979/2008) argues that peasant pro-
duction is distinguished from capitalism because there is no
appropriation and realization of surplus value or accumula-
tion of capital. The object is the satisfaction of family needs,
not profit (Araghi, 1995). It is different from proletariat pro-
duction because the individual retains some control.
Therefore, the notion of subsistence and the maintenance of
some control over the means of production are the two cen-
tralcomponentsmarkingpeasantryproduction.InZimbabwe,
the land distribution program since the year 2000 has created
different classes of rural dwellers. Some have become capital
producers and are therefore not the focus of the discussions
in this article.
Memmi's (1967) portrait of the colonized vividly reveals a
human being denied human dignity and subdued by force and
violence. Following Calderon-Zaks's (2006) analysis, colo-
nialism is not narrowly defined as a relationship between
"nations," or at least the colonizing power being a "nation" . .
. but is concerned with a colonized people rather than a colo-
nized nation (pp. 39-40). According to Pinderhughes (2011),
internal colonialism is identifiable by the presence of features
of "subordination and oppression, not on majority/minority
numbers ratios, geographic distance, capital export, foreign-
ness, and legal distinctions" (p. 236) and by analogy the cur-
rent socio-economic and political conditions of peasants in
Zimbabwe are colonial. They are characterized by massive
educational inequalities between urban and rural areas
(Hwami, 2011; Share, 2009; Shizha, 2006; Students Solidarity
Trust, 2009; Zeilig, 2008; Zimbabwe National Students
Union [ZINASU], 2010), state and ruling party suppression,
intimidation and violence (Blair, 2002; Hager, 2007; Hammar,
2008; Hammar, McGregor, & Landau, 2010; Hwami, 2010;
Krigger, 2008; Mamdani, 2008; Ranger, 2004; Sadomba,
2011), systematic economic subjugation and infrastructural
underdevelopment (Bond & Manyanya, 2003; Gono, 2008;
Moore, 2008), and profound health disparities (Ministry of
Health and Child Welfare, 2009; Tren & Bate, 2005; World
Health Organization, 2010; United Nations Development
Program(UNDP), 2000;Zimbabwe National Statistics
Agency & ICF International, 2012). Access to paved roads,
electrified schools, and hospitals, and consumer goods vary
directly with proximity to a town. Rural schools are poorly
equipped compared with urban schools and summative Grade
7, Ordinary and Advanced levels results are consistently bet-
ter in urban schools than in rural areas (Gregson, Terceira,
Mushati, Nyamukapa, & Campbelle, 2004; Mbanje, 2012),
and there is a restriction in terms of disciplines rural students
can study as most schools do not have necessary facilities
especially access to power/electricity.

These processes have witnessed with policy consistency
elite nationalists of predominantly urban domicile and party
leaders fortifying themselves in the towns and cities against
rural poverty and diseases. One observes since the demise of
British colonial administration a heightened differentiation
of town and country, urban-centered power elite that has
firmly set out to dominate a largely rural society to which
they relate as an alien power. Sadomba (2011) posits that
since the year 2000 "the elite grabbed the opportunity for
heightened primitive accumulation" (p. 215) by hijacking the
Black empowerment and indigenization programs, particu-
larly land reforms that were spearheaded by war veterans
with the mass support of the peasants. Traditional leaders,
such as chiefs, have been given administrative authority to
discipline their people and in the process paving way for
unopposed state/corporate penetrations into their traditional
lands for mining and dam construction (Hawkins, 2009;
Madebwe, Madebwe, & Mavusa, 2011; Manyanhaire,
Svotwa, Sango, & Munasirei, 2007; Mwonzora, 2011;
Rusinga, Murwendo, & Zinhiva, 2012; Zimbabwe
Environmental Lawyers Association, 2012), programs that
have led to displacement of the peasants to give way for irri-
gation and mining adventures whose benefits have not been
observed by the affected people.
It is in this sense that the term internal colonization is
used here to designate the processes by which large parts and
sections of Zimbabwe are being colonized by their own rul-
ing elite (across the political divide) for both political and
economic reasons. Internal colonialism is associated with the
manner in which certain sections of society exercise their
hegemony (Hind, 1984). In the eyes of the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU PF) and
other elite groups in the country, including opposition par-
ties, they are simply making use of the power the interna-
tional market affords to consolidate their own position as an
urbanized elite. The indigenization and Black empowerment
programs, driven by the elite and accompanied by economic
and political exploitation of the peasants, and gradually
transforming the whole peasantry into a legally feudal (con-
trolled by traditional leaders most of them with no knowl-
edge of a fair justice system especially in relation to gender
rights and other facets of modern minority inequalities) and
factually discriminated class, the lowest in the social ladder,
is precisely what this article terms internal colonialism.
It should be acknowledged that critics have pointed out
that there is no attempt in the theory of internal colonialism
to identify the specific mode of exploitation and domination
that differentiates it from class or race exploitation and domi-
nation (Wolpe, 1975). They have seized on the idea that cer-
tain individuals in identified under-classes have made it to
success; for example, the rich Afro-American, the successful
from indigenous First-Nations and from peasant back-
grounds. However, by viewing colonial as wider and encom-
passing "anything imposed and dominating" (Dei &
Asgharzadeh, 2001, p. 300), including race/ethnicity, culture
of poverty, geographical underdevelopment, political and
economic domination, gender inequalities among many oth-
ers, one can appreciate the utility of the concept or theory of
internal colonialism in gaining an understanding of the sub-
ordinate status of some groups in modern societies.
Method
This was a critical interpretive case study of a public univer-
sity in Zimbabwe. Critical interpretivism involves critiquing
power. In education it considers the politics of education and
when used together with postcolonial perspectives as was
done in this study, it develops an activist prong on behalf of
historically colonized people, who continue to be neo-colo-
nized and oppressed (Apple, 2009). Issues to do with neo-
colonized peasants should be approached utilizing critical
inquiry methods that challenge neoliberalism and national-
ism, simultaneously. Consequently, the goal of this case
study was to develop a holistic picture of the educational
experiences of selected students from rural peasantry back-
ground (Creswell, 2007; Yin, 2009). The exploratory nature
of a case study allows the researcher to investigate and report
on complex, dynamic, and unfolding interactions of events,
human relationships, and other factors in a unique instance
(Creswell, 2007). The researcher had the opportunity to iden-
tify living conditions, learning conditions, and academic
experiences and pursued opportunities for in-depth analysis
of the phenomenon as they unfolded. Yin (2009) describes a
case study "as an examination of specific phenomenon such
as a program, an event, a person, an institution or a social
group" (p. 25). Case study is particularly useful in studies
that seek to uncover observable patterns in organizations,
institutions, and countries. Case studies are also heuristic in
the sense that they "illustrate the readers' understanding of
the phenomenon under study . . . they can bring about dis-
covery of new meaning, extend the reader's experience or
confirm what is known" (Creswell, 2007, p. 18).There are
however, several limitations to case study design, a major
one being lack of generalization and time-consuming nature
of the analysis. Patton (2002) argues, however, that general-
izations can take several forums, from the features of a single
case to many others with similar features or from part of a
case to the whole of that case is possible. Therefore, the
emerging findings can be applied to other students of similar
peasantry background throughout the country.
Sources of Data
The study adopted purposeful sampling techniques, selecting
participants from peasantry background. Utilizing official
university records from the assistant registrar's office, 50
participants were surveyed or interviewed from a public uni-
versity in Zimbabwe. No other variables were considered
important. For ethical reasons, the name of the university
will not be mentioned. Initial contacts were made at the insti-
4 SAGE Open
tution where face-to-face interviews were conducted
(n = 20). This was followed by questionnaires sent to indi-
viduals suggested by those previously interviewed (n = 30).
The interview was developed following the suggestions of
Mouton (2001), namely, design, construction, and piloting.
The final interview instrument combined different kinds of
questions dealing with family background, university living
and learning conditions, academic performance, and partici-
pants' level of awareness of their circumstances. Questions
were both semi-structured and unstructured giving room for
greater latitude in asking broad questions in ways that the
interviewer deemed appropriate and probing for clarification
and deeper understanding of interviewees.
Document analysis as a research method involved the
process of examining and understanding contents in docu-
ments from sources internal and external to the research, in
this case official university publications, student and faculty
union newsletters, and government policy documents. The
study tried to minimize the pitfalls of document review as a
non-interview strategy which are accuracy, relevance,
authenticity, and outdated information (McMillan &
Schumacher, 2006; Yin, 2009). The researcher guarded
against these challenges through a thorough evaluation of the
authenticity and relevance of the documents in terms of the
sources, dates, and accuracy. Miles and Huberman's (1994)
methodological approach was used to analyze and interpret
the data for the study. According to Miles and Huberman,
data reduction is the first step in the process of data analysis,
and . . . "it refers to the process of selecting, focusing, simpli-
fying, abstracting, and transforming the data that appear in
writing of field notes or transcriptions" (p. 16). This advice
informed the research.
Emerging Themes (Findings)
The underdeveloped and difficult living conditions of the
peasants in rural areas were inherited from British colonial
administration and are continuing in post-independent
Zimbabwe. Two strong hegemonic forces, namely, elite
nationalism and neoliberalism, appear to be the dominant
policy frameworks. The victims of the consequent system
are the peasant communities that are integrated and subjected
to the logic of imperialist expansion (Amin, 2011b). The
ineffective and backward nature of social services is clearly
manifested in the education system. Statistics from the
national examination board, the Zimbabwe School
Examination Council (ZIMSEC) consistently show that bet-
ter results come from urban and boarding schools compared
with rural day schools (Mbanje, 2012). This is mainly
explained by the poor resources found in most rural schools
that have resulted in experienced and qualified teachers
shunning serving in such schools. Most rural areas do not
have access to electricity and students attending rural sec-
ondary schools do not study disciplines such as physics,
chemistry, and biology, and consequently cannot take up
university courses/programs that require a natural science
background. Rural students are therefore found restricted in
the humanities and in a way leading them to low-paying
careers.
It has also been observed that in internal colonialism, "the
underdeveloped condition is reproduced and maintained by
the same mechanisms of cultural domination, political
oppression and economic exploitation" (Wolpe, 1975, p.
229). One approach of cultural domination has been the con-
tinued use of English as the language of instruction and the
associated requirement of a pass in English at Ordinary level
if one is to proceed to post-secondary education. The urban
are generally better in understanding the English language
compared with the rural people and this gives them a clear
advantage. Furthermore, under internal colonialism the
nature of education is governed by authorities outside the
"colonies" (Epstein, 1971, p. 192). Currently in Zimbabwe,
there is a blatant bias toward a mono-narrative of nation
building that reifies nationalist historiography under what is
termed patriotic history (Ranger, 2004; Tendi, 2008).
Patriotic history is compulsory throughout the education sys-
tem in various forms. It stresses political history and does not
tolerate "disloyal" issues raised by historians of nationalism
(Ranger, 2004). Not only does it destroy critical thinking
among students; it also constructs a picture of sovereignty
and independence that is largely partisan and not national.
Peasant Education as Internal Colonialism:
Students' Living Conditions
The colonial conditions of students from peasant background
can further be demonstrated by their living and learning con-
ditions that make meaningful education difficult to attain. As
all universities are in urban areas, the living conditions of
most students with no relatives in cities were found to be
challenging. According to a recent study on the University of
Zimbabwe:
The halls of residence have been shut, students eat from informal
roadside caterers and students'vocational loans are not available.
It emerged early this year that 28% of students had dropped out
of the UZ. Students have been struggling to raise fees of between
US$300 and US$1 500 in a country where civil servants earn
less than US$300 per month and unemployment is pegged at
90%. (Muzulu, 2010)
Students who endure such conditions do not have rela-
tives who can provide them with accommodation in the cities
in which universities are located. These observations are cor-
roborated by sentiments from university students that were
interviewed.
The conditions outside campus are pathetic. I am staying in a
garage and we are 13 in that room. We now have slums
developing within the Mount Pleasant area. Those staying
outside Mount Pleasant have to board two buses to get to
Hwami 5
campus. That is expensive. We pay $US25 a head. (Interview
notes, Student leader, August 2010)
Similar observations were highlighted by a politically
charged study commissioned by the national student body.
At the University of Zimbabwe over 5000 students squat in
garages in and around Mt Pleasant while their hostels have
become safe havens for rats and bats. The closure was ruled
illegal by Justice Hlatshwayo at the High court in July 2007 in
case the of Trevor Marai & Anr vs Director of Accommodation
& Catering Services University of Zimbabwe & 3 Ors HC
3592/07, but the order has been ignored by the Nyagura
administration. It is clear that the closure is a blatant political
move aimed at demobilizing the students of Zimbabwe by some
uncouth politicians fearing to lose their positions to a student led
uprising. (ZINASU, 2011)
Such administrative policies and actions negatively affect
students from rural areas more than any other groups and
tend to drive them into anti-social behavior, risky political
activity, or passive compliance to authority or views incon-
gruent with university culture (Hwami, 2014). Internal colo-
nialisminvolvesthesubordinationandcontinuingdomination
of the peasantry in Zimbabwe. As was noted by Welch
(1988), education often serves as an instrument of internal
colonialism by socializing the colonized into an acceptance
of inferior status, power, and wealth. The higher education
finance support mechanism known as the cadetship system
has been exposed as a political instrument to pressurize stu-
dents to support the ruling ZANU PF party.
The Committee on Higher Education, Science and Technology
said a probe it conducted recently found that the country's
so-called cadetship programme was highly politicised,
benefiting mainly Mugabe sympathisers. Parliament said the
cadetship programme's criteria for selection were discriminatory,
ranging from political affiliation to faculty preference. It said
that proof of the partisanship of the cadet scheme was the recent
withdrawal of the funding of 12 students, on the grounds that
they supported the Movement for Democratic Change, a rival
party to Mugabe's ZANU PF. (Mushininga, 2011)
Earlier, the largely opposition aligned national student
body had made similar observations.
It remains the state's responsibility to provide quality and
affordable education to all its citizens; the cadetship scheme
must be revisited, particularly its conditions of bonding, it must
be administered by an independent body, which is non-
discriminatory, no-partisan . . . (ZINASU, 2009)
It is therefore evident that the university education system
is unfriendly to children from peasantry background. The
educational experience from rural schools up to public uni-
versities appear to develop an inferior graduate who ends up
unemployed, in low-paying public service career job or a
"border jumper" (people who leave the country, mostly by
illegal methods, to South Africa, Botswana, and other neigh-
boring countries). A contrast should be made with children
from dominant classes, mainly from urban areas who attend
well-established and resourced schools, boarding schools
with highly qualified teachers, and the rich whose children
attend exclusive private schools with almost all modern edu-
cational facilities. Students from the latter category are found
dominating hard sciences faculties that generally lead to
assured and better-paying careers and some go abroad for
university studies. What is being observed is "the existence
and persistence of an academic underclass" (DiGiacomo,
1997, p. 96) that serves the political and economic objectives
of the elite.
Peasant Education as Internal Colonialism:
Students' Learning Conditions
The learning conditions of students from peasantry back-
ground have equally been deteriorating and challenging. It is
common knowledge that most students from rural areas are
poor and cannot afford to pay university fees without gov-
ernment support. According to one study,
In February 2005, the government scrapped off the loan system
for students and introduced payment of fees directly. This plus
the dollarization of the economy (use of the United States dollar
as the official currency after the Zimbabwean dollar became
useless in 2009) mean education has become fully privatised.
This scenario has left many students stranded with no options
but to drop out of college or to quit education and go abroad to
explore other options. (Students Solidarity Trust, 2011, p. 12)
One student told me that
In the past you could be allowed to sit for examinations before
paying up fees, but now we have security guards stationed at
examination venues to bar those who have not paid up.
(Interview notes, Student leader, July 2010)
A university administrator further confirmed these dis-
turbing observations:
I can tell you that we are facing a lot of challenges. What quickly
comes to mind is the scenario where students cannot afford
paying for tuition and government is also not in a position to
support students. So the greatest dilemma is to carry on with
university education with no one funding it. Students are asked
to apply for loans/cadetship funds, which they do, but the
government does not have the money, does not release the
money but expect university education to continue. (Interview
notes, University administrator, August 2010)
All these processes have culminated in some students
completely failing to complete their studies. These narratives
and experiences portray the difficult educational conditions
6 SAGE Open
being experienced by mostly peasant children. Some stu-
dents have joined student and national politics mainly under
the auspices of the ZINASU, but the response of the state has
been vicious. Student activists have been arrested, beaten,
and many suspended or expelled (see Hwami & Kapoor,
2012; Students Solidarity Trust, 2011). Some have argued
that the contemporary suppression of student activism
resembles the Rhodesian system and corroborates the con-
clusion that in some post-independent nations, "a version of
colonialism is being reproduced and duplicated from within"
(Kapoor, 2009, p. 4).
Discussion of Emerging Themes
The challenges peasants'children are experiencing should be
understood within the wider context of crises emerging from
attempts by governments in the periphery to catch up with
the modern or developed (north) capitalist world. Modernity
is viewed by many as Westernization. It is "exclusively a
European product and experiences" (Quijano, 2000, p. 542).
(Un)fortunately, it is also equated to development. The drive
toward modernity is seen going against the cultural and tra-
ditional living styles of the peasant and government policies
are seen as largely informed by the functionalist sociology of
modernization-culture affects the character and logic of eco-
nomic operation. According to Amin (2011a),
The second intuition is that economics or more precisely
economic (and social) changes, induces the phenomena of
acculturation and deculturation, namely changes the culture.
The relationship between culture and economics is dialectic
rather than functionalist or structural. (p. 144)
The level of opposition the government has encountered
since the introduction of modernity inspired policies from
university students has increased (Hwami & Kapoor, 2012)
and the consequent heavy-handed reaction from the govern-
ment constitute an important aspect of the political crisis in
Zimbabwe (Danzereau, 2005; Hwami, 2010). Global eco-
nomic policy frameworks such as privatization and com-
modification of education as they are being implemented in
higher education since 1991 and more violently from 2000
should be understood as government's role in spreading cap-
italism and attempts to change the cultures of the peasants in
line with modernity demands. This further implies that the
internal colonial system developing in Zimbabwe and its
attended devastation of the education prospects of peasantry
children should be analyzed within the context of contempo-
rary global coloniality. This implies the reproduction of colo-
niality (relations of subordination and exploitation) at a
global scale under neoliberal values and principles of educa-
tion (Mignolo, 2003, p. 99) that are being driven by local
elites. The emergence and rise of the "black bourgeoisie"
(Moyo & Yeros, 2011, p. 94) in Zimbabwe and the rabid
adoption and implementation of market reforms in all sectors
of the country including social services shows that they are
in collaboration with global capital. Across societies bour-
geois thought is viewed as modern thought (Amin, 1997, p.
134). He further observed that
Governing classes generally formulate the visions and
aspirations within the perspective of really existing capitalism;
willingly or not, they subject their strategies to the constraints of
global capitalist expansion. The state is the unilateral mouthpiece
of the interests of transnational capital, or its subaltern comprador
allies. (Amin, 2011b, p. 327)
As student narratives have illustrated, the implementation
of modernity principles have had deleterious consequences
on their university careers and their responses have included
demonstrations and joining political activity with opposition
political groupings (Chikwanha, 2009; Hwami, 2012). In
response, the government has been ruthless as seen by stu-
dent arrests and beatings, and hence widespread accusations
that it has become dictatorial (Raftopoulos & Mlambo; 2009;
Tendi, 2010). The authorities in Zimbabwe are aiding the
spread of market values by use of force, further giving cre-
dence to the internal colonial explanation of contemporary
Zimbabwe.
By enforcing neoliberal policies in universities, as was
illustrated above, the biggest losers have been students from
rural (peasant) areas who find adapting to life in the urban
areas very difficult. Besides their concentration in disciplines
that will make it very difficult for them to be gainfully
employed, access and completion rates continue to drop
(Students Solidarity Trust, 2009). Such cases then join the
unemployed in cities and rural areas or the popular trend of
exiting to neighboring countries. This system of peasant edu-
cation and the general living conditions of the peasantry can
sufficiently be conceptualized by utilizing internal colonial
analytics. It is colonial as its achievement to date is the con-
sistent subordination of the peasantry as they are demanded
to provide cheap labor and political support.
Concluding Remarks
Colonialism imposed its control of the social production of
wealth through military conquest and subsequent political
dictatorship. But its most important area of domination was the
mental universe of the colonised, the control through culture, of
how people perceived themselves and their relationship to the
world. Economic and political control can never be complete or
effective without mental control. To control a people's culture is
to control their tools of self-definition in relationship to others.
(wa Thiong'o, 1981, p. 16)
According to the thesis of this article, the existence of
colonialism (internal) explains the unfavorable educational
circumstances students from the peasantry are experiencing.
Against such an observation, there is need for education that
challenges the hegemonizing systems. In line with Ngugi wa
Hwami 7
Thiong'o intelligent analysis captured above, the university
or the academic community must realize the existence of
colonial relations in "independent" Zimbabwe. This has
proved to be a daunting task for elite and mostly Western
educated academic members. Contemporary education cur-
riculum in Zimbabwe largely espouse a Euro-American cul-
ture, and the more educated (formal schooling) one is, the
more one is associated with European style of living and dis-
tances oneself from Zimbabwean way of living (largely
peasantry). It is therefore an established fact that higher edu-
cation institutions are more European than African/
Zimbabwean in cultural outlook (language, official norms,
for example, office manners, classroom behaviors, etc.). This
has largely been analyzed as neo-colonial or colonial hang-
over that was expected to end. Along this observation, A.
Mishra Tarc (2009) notes that
Postcolonial studies are slow to come to education, in part
because postcolonial studies threaten to undo education, to
unravel the passionately held-onto thought and knowledge of
the modern Western-educated student and scholar. (p. 195)
It is disturbing to ignore the plight of the poor, that is the
peasants, and to view the education of this group as normal,
is equally pathetic. There is need for the academe to identify
with struggling peoples and hence focus research and schol-
arship toward ameliorating the suffering of ordinary citizens.
There should be a realization that "that the iniquitous phe-
nomenon of exploitation can assume a black face" (Fanon,
1963, p. 94). Student arrests and beatings exemplify exploi-
tation and as Fanon further noted, "people must learn to give
up their simplistic perception of the oppressor" (p. 94).
Fanon (1963) argues that there can be no authentic libera-
tion without decolonization, whereas Dei (2010) suggests
that "decolonization must be complete and must overcome
exploitation, alienation and oppression, and dehumaniza-
tion" (p. xvii). This is the call the academic community is
being called on to confront and further highlights the need
for decolonizing education, that is one that
Brings to the fore questions of power relations among actors and
different players in the school system while at the same time
upholding the agency, resistance and local cultural resource
knowledge of all learners . . . is about change, it is about a
particular way of knowing that emerged through bodies of
difference, it is about embodied knowledge, it is a particular
process that encounters the foreign and the local of imposition. It
is about resistance and the fight for social justice. (Dei, 2010, p. 6)
Progressive scholars throughout the world have been
advocating the use of homegrown indigenous solutions to
modern challenges. This article corroborates the search for
solutions to the crisis students from poor rural backgrounds
are facing. The concept of unhu is a traditional Zimbabwean
philosophy of living in harmony with other people (Battle,
2009; Ramose, 2003; Swanson, 2007; Venter, 2004) and
embodies the spirit of sharing (Shizha, 2009). It is the same
as what Scott (1976) calls the moral economy that is based
on reciprocal relationships and the right to subsistence. The
values in this traditional philosophy clearly stand in opposi-
tion to the hegemonic tenets inherent in local and global cor-
poratism as being practiced in higher education. Thinking
and advocating from unhu would be in line with what
Mignolo (2000) describes as "intellectual decolonization"
(p. 64). The higher education community, including students
from peasantry background, are failing to think beyond capi-
talism and intellectually, they are not thinking outside
Western modernity. Their reluctance to expound ideas from
indigenous perspectives illustrated the continued existence
of "colonized intellectuals" (Fanon, 1963, p. 158), which led
Said (1994) to offer a suggestion that
Academics/intellectuals are expected to speak truth to power;
insiders promote special interests, but intellectuals should be the
ones to question patriotic nationalism, corporate thinking, and a
sense of class, racial or gender privilege. (p. xiii)
The article acknowledges the difficulties of achieving this
in the current politically volatile Zimbabwean climate but
provoking a discussion is a significant step toward this pro-
gressive objective. By calling for the decolonization of the
academe, the article is encouraging conceptualization out-
side the framework of the oppressive forces of global capital-
ismandlocalgovernmentpoliticalandeconomicdictatorship.
It is "border thinking" and "double critique" of the two colo-
nial forces that ultimately lead to "an another thinking, a
thinking that is located at the border of coloniality of power"
(Mignolo, 2000, p. 67). It is liberative epistemology aimed at
ending global and internal coloniality as currently played out
in Zimbabwe's higher education leaving peasant students at
the mercy of social evils and political opportunists. In another
sense, a double critique as advocated in this study is "the
criticism of the imperial discourses as well as national dis-
courses asserting identity and differences articulated in and
by imperial discourses" (Khatibi, 1983, p. 39). This critical
border thinking is the epistemic response of the colonized
(Grosfoguel, 2005), that is "contributing to academic efforts
to defend the public sphere from its further integration into
the neoliberal and imperialist practices of the state and of
global capitalism" (McLaren & Jaramillo, 2005, p. 131).
Thus, in a way this article is corroborating efforts of many
other scholars to give back value to local liberative episte-
mology in the fight against colonizing forces.
