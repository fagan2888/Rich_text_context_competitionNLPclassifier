Introduction
Over the years, genre studies have aroused a lot of interest
among researchers, and in the past few decades, genre analy-
sis has turned into one of the most promising areas of
research.
The term genre has diverse meanings that span a number
of fields. With regard to the field of language learning, the
most commonly accepted definition of genre has been put
forward by Swales (1990) and Bhatia (1993) (Henry &
Roseberry, 2001).
"These writers have stressed that a genre is, first of all, a
cultural and interpersonal event making use of language"
(Henry & Roseberry, 2001, p. 94). The two writers also
maintain that a genre has a recognizable structure that is
related to its social purpose. This generic structure is made
up of "elements," commonly called "moves" of the genre
(Henry & Roseberry, 2001).
Among different types of genres, "homely discourse," to
use Miller's (1984) terminology, has drawn scholars' atten-
tion in recent years. Homely genres, according to Miller
(1984, p. 5), are "the `de facto' genres, the types we have
names for in everyday language." Examples of these particu-
lar genres are wedding announcements, birthday announce-
ments, obituaries, and the like (Al-Ali, 2006). Wedding
invitation genre, as a homely genre, can be applied as a
means of enhancing language and cultural awareness. "This
would add depth to what is known and may broaden the field
of genre analysis research" (Al-Ali, 2006, p. 711).
Invitation is "a commemorative social action having the
function of informing and requesting the presence or partici-
pation of a person(s) kindly and courteously to some place,
gathering, entertainment, etc., or to do something" (Al-Ali,
2006, p. 691). Invitations are of two types: written and spo-
ken forms. "Printed forms of invitation, in particular, share
certain generic features that set them apart from other text
types" (Al-Ali, 2006, p. 691).
Among invitations of different kinds, wedding invitation
genre is a ubiquitous genre that people around the world are
well acquainted with. Published studies on this genre are not
numerous: One study was conducted by Al-Ali (2006).
Drawing on two discourse analytic frameworks, that is,
genre analysis and critical discourse analysis (CDA), Al-Ali
(2006) examined a total of 200 Arabic written wedding invi-
tations collected by 45 undergraduateArab students at Jordan
University of Science and Technology as part of an elective
course in discourse analysis. A detailed genre analysis speci-
fied eight obligatory and nonobligatory generic components
that generally appear in Jordanian wedding invitation cards.
CDA results, on the other hand, revealed "how religious
affiliation and masculine kinship authority not only construct
and shape text component selection but also color the lexical
choices and naming practices" (Al-Ali, 2006, p. 691).
Yet another study that is worth mentioning at this point is
that of Clynes and Henry (2004) that was designed with the
purpose of determining the extent to which Brunei university

On the Persian Wedding Invitation Genre
Maryam Sharif1 and Lotfollah Yarmohammadi1
Abstract
The present study is an attempt to conduct a genre analysis of Persian wedding invitations. Drawing on the model of genre
analysis proposed by Swales, a sample of 70 Persian wedding invitation cards has been analyzed in terms of their component
moves, obligatory and optional moves, and move order. The results of the analysis have revealed seven generic components
by means of which Iranian inviters ritually structure their wedding invitation texts in Persian. The results of the study will
shed light on how the Persian wedding invitation genre is constructed drawing on the linguistic features of its generic moves
and why the wedding invitation texts are structured in this particular way in Persian providing hints of the underlying socio-
cultural conventions responsible for shaping this very genre in Persian. It is hoped that the results of this study will be
illuminating for raising cultural awareness.

students are able to identify and explain the linguistic fea-
tures of the Brunei Malay wedding invitations. To fulfill this
purpose, two groups of analysis were carried out, one by the
authors and one by nine sophomore undergraduate students
taking the English Genre Analysis course as part of their BA
studies at University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD). The two
groups were assigned to analyze at least three Bruneian wed-
ding invitations in terms of identifying elements such as
moves, obligatory and optional moves, move order and fur-
ther to explain in terms of the communicative purpose of the
genre why certain key linguistic features appear in the genre.
The results of the study indicated that the students managed
to accurately identify the related moves and move order;
however, they were less successful at explaining the linguis-
tic features in terms of the overall communicative purposes
of the genre.
There seems to have been no systematic investigation of
the wedding invitation genre in Persian, and this study is the
first of its type. It is, therefore, of particular significance as it
is an attempt to perform a genre analysis on Persian wedding
invitation announcements to identify their typical generic
component patterns, and further to understand how members
of specific discourse communities in Iran construct, apply,
and interpret this very specific genre to achieve their com-
munity goals, and why they write the genre in the way they
do (Bhatia, 2004).
The Persian Wedding Ritual Pattern
Wedding is a joyous occasion wherein the bride and the
groom celebrate their union and formally announce the
beginning of their new life together. Among the myriads of
wedding rituals around the world, the Persian marriage cer-
emony is an ancient and a beautiful tradition celebrated with
glory and distinction among a large gathering of relatives
and friends. The history of Persian weddings goes back to
the Zoroastrian era (Cawasji Katrak, 1965), and it consists
of a rich amalgam of traditions. To gain a better insight into
the nature of Persian wedding ceremonies, "an understand-
ing of the broader socio-cultural context related to the social
norms and values of the conventionalized occasion" is nec-
essary (Al-Ali, 2006, p. 693). In Iranian society, the influ-
ence of religion on most aspects of life is evident. The state
religion in the country is Islam, with Muslims making up the
majority of the population. The marriage practices are gov-
erned by Islamic prescriptions. Even in ancient Iran, the
ideal of marriage used to be highly religious (Cawasji
Katrak, 1965). Moreover, Persian weddings have been par-
tially influenced by patriarchy. Although in modern times
couples choose their spouse-to-be by themselves, family
consent in marriage is still valued in Iran. That is to say,
"usually the groom-to-be will ask the father of the bride-to-
be for her hand in marriage. This is a tradition that many
cultures keep in showing respect for the elderly" (Rezaei,
2009, para. 1).
Modern Persian weddings encompass subtle traditional
elements, yet there are variations in some rural areas or
smaller cities where some ethnic groups try to retain tradi-
tions and rituals that might deviate from the modern wedding
(Rezaei, 2009). The typical Persian wedding consists of two
phases: the aghd (the ceremony) and the aroosi (the
reception).
The aghd is a legal ceremony conducted by an officiator
in which the couple sign a contract and formalize their rela-
tionship as husband and wife. Dressed in a white gown, the
bride sits next to the bridegroom wearing a suit. Before them,
there is a sofreh-ye aghd, that is, a spread or a tablecloth to
wish the couple well in their union. "Food and objects tradi-
tionally associated with marriage are arranged on the sofreh"
(Batmanglij, 2004, para. 5), all of which are used symboli-
cally. As the officiator is performing the marriage ceremony,
two women who are happily married hold a square of silk or
tulle over the marrying couple's heads, and other women, in
turn, rub two sugar cones together to symbolize the raining
of sweet joy and happiness down on the bride and the groom
(Batmanglij, 2004). Having gotten the positive response
from the bride, the officiator declares the couple husband and
wife. At this moment, the newly-weds exchange rings and
they are showered with small golden coins, sweets, or noghl
(sugar-coated almonds) as a means of insuring the new cou-
ple good luck.
A follow-up to the aghd is the aroosi, which is celebrated
immediately after the aghd or some time later. "The aroosi is a
lavish meal, sometimes with a whole roast lamb as the center-
piece" (Batmanglij, 2004, para. 16). In addition to feasting, the
reception usually includes a lot of dancing. The music band or
the DJ can provide a festive mood and a lively atmosphere for
this very special occasion. On the whole, the Persian wedding
is an elaborate affair, especially among the affluent, requiring
a lot of preparation. However, there are companies that are
designed to assist the couples in getting their marriage arrange-
ments, from catering to decorations, done.
Theoretical Overview
The present study draws on Swales' (1990) genre analysis.
"Researchers from diverse fields, like rhetoric, writing, lit-
erature, linguistics, anthropology, etc., have been trying to
clarify the notion of genre. Each group has defined and char-
acterized genre differently" (Shokouhi & Kamyab, 2004,
p. 159).
The traditional approaches to the study of genre used to
consider genre as a classificatory category consisting of sta-
ble members with similar textual features. However, in the
new approaches to genre analysis, there have been attempts
to reinterpret the notion of genre (Shokouhi & Kamyab,
2004).
One of the most influential definitions of genre in the new
paradigm has been set forth by Swales (1990). Swales (1990)
has proposed the following definition for genre:
Sharif and Yarmohammadi 3
A genre is a class of communicative events, the members of
which share some set of communicative purposes. These
purposes are recognized by the expert members of the parent
discourse community, and thereby constitute the rationale for
the genre. This rationale shapes the schematic structure of the
discourse and influences and constrains choice of content and
style. Communicative purpose is both a privileged criterion and
one that operates to keep the scope of genre as here conceived
narrowly focused on comparable rhetorical action. In addition to
purpose, exemplars of a genre exhibit various patterns of
similarity in terms of structure, style, content and intended
audience. If all high probability expectations are realized, the
exemplar will be viewed as prototypical by the parent
community. The genre names inherited and produced by
discourse communities and imported by others constitute
valuable ethnographic communication, but typically need
further validation (p. 58).
Accordingly, Swales (1990) conceives of genre analysis
as "a means of studying spoken and written discourse for
applied ends" (p. 1). In the study of written discourse, genre
analysis is conducted with the purpose of finding out how
writers conventionally sequence material to obtain particular
goals (Richards & Schmidt, 2002). "The genre as a whole is
made up of a sequence of component moves, obligatory and
optional moves, each of which carries out a minor function in
the global function of the genre text" (Al-Ali, 2006, p. 696 ).
"Not all the moves are essential in a genre, and conventions
across disciplines and cultures may differ as to which ones
are vital for achieving which purpose" (Kachru & Smith,
2008, p. 161). These component moves do not necessarily
appear in the same order.
Data and Procedures
For the sake of data analysis, a corpus of 70 Persian wedding
invitation cards was collected. The Persian data, published
from 1995 to date in Iran, was accumulated from within the
circle of the researchers' relatives and friends. To ensure that
regional and cultural variations were taken into consider-
ation, the data were collected from among two different
social strata: the upper social stratum and the middle-class
group. The reason for not including the lower-class stratum
in the data collection procedure was the scarcity of published
wedding cards among lower-class families as they often can-
not incur the great expenses of holding wedding celebrations
or even sending invitation cards, and in case there is a wed-
ding celebration, the guests are often invited over the tele-
phone or by word of mouth for frugality considerations.
The Persian corpus was then analyzed following the frame-
work proposed by Swales (1990), which considers any given
genre as consisting of a series of component moves which,
together, express the communicative purpose of the genre.
This study, therefore, was directed toward analyzing the
wedding invitations in terms of their component moves to
determine how Persian inviters accomplish the communica-
tive purpose of this particular genre as a socio-cultural event.
The Persian invitations were further analyzed for their oblig-
atory and optional moves, and their move order. The analysis
revealed seven component moves within the generic struc-
ture of the Persian wedding invitations that will be discussed
in detail in the following section.
Results and Discussion
In this section, the genre analysis of the corpus at hand is
presented, along with explanations of the lexico-grammati-
cal features of the move structure of the genre. Yet, prior to
our discussion of the generic structure of the Persian wed-
ding invitation texts, a brief overview of the nonlinguistic
features of the wedding cards including the graphic images,
decorative borders, visual organization of the text, to name
just a few, seems essential for a comprehensive better under-
standing of the genre under investigation.
Non-Linguistic Features of Persian Wedding Invitations
Wedding invitations are the first glimpse guests might
have of the magnificence of the celebration. Ranging from
preprinted to custom-designed cards, Persian wedding
invitation texts are printed on light cardboards of unique
colors such as white, cream, golden, silver, beige, pink,
and the like. The front page decorated with ribbon, pressed
flowers, embossed images of wedding rings, hearts, roses,
bouquets of mixed flowers, or a studio portrait of the bride
and the groom almost always features either the first names
of the bride and the groom in English or the formulaic
phrase "Message of Happiness" (see Figure 1). Persian
wedding cards are flavored with the beautiful art of cal-
ligraphy. The names of the bride and the groom, sometimes
intertwined, are typed in a separate line using a larger font
size. Another nonlinguistic element that attracts attention
in Persian wedding cards is the presence of decorative bor-
ders, including floral and traditional borders. The color of
the ink and the envelope are carefully selected to go with
the invitation design.
Generic Structure of Persian Wedding Invitations
Component move structure analysis of our sample of Persian
wedding invitation texts revealed seven generic moves that
are as follows:
Opening. All the wedding invitation cards under scrutiny fea-
tured this obligatory element that appears in central position
on the top of the invitations. In general, Persian wedding
invitations open with "In the Name of God" phrases as Bis-
millah Al-rahman Al-rahim is "the formula recommended by
the prophet for use when beginning any event" (Rippin,
4 SAGE Open
1990, as quoted by Clynes & Henry, 2004, p. 235). A few
examples of this component move, along with their English
translation, appear below:
1. be nam-e peyvænd dæhænde-ye qælbha
In the Name of the One Who Joins Hearts Together
2. be nam-e xaleq-e eshq
In the Name of the Creator of Love
3. be nam-e xaleq-e hæsti
In the Name of the Creator of the Universe
However, in 22.8% of the data under investigation, "In the
Name of God" phrases were replaced by "Under theAuspices
of God" phrases (dær pærtov-e enayat-e pærværdegar). This,
in turn, is associated with Muslims' belief to commence any
event with a special mention of God.
Identifying the bride and the groom by first name. This generic
move that almost always (94.2% within our corpus) appears
immediately after the opening identifies the bride and the
groom by their first names. In 54.2% of the analyzed data,
the first name of the bride was mentioned on the right side
before the forename of the groom on the left side (see
Figure 2), whereas in 30% of the data the name of the
groom preceded that of the bride (see Figure 3). The first
name of the bride on the right side was specially observed
among the wedding announcements collected from upper
class people, while the first name of the groom on the right
side was more rampant among the wedding cards from
middle-class families. The appearance of the bride's name
prior to that of the groom might express the very fact that
the position of the Iranian wife is one of the equality with
her husband and "the wife ranks . . . more as the equal of the
husband than his dependant" (Cawasji Katrak, 1965, p. 5).
On the other hand, precedence of the groom's name over
the bride's name probably has its roots in the Islamic belief
that "a man is thought to be the guardian of a woman and
remains the instrument of social control after she marries"
(Al-Ali, 2006, p. 702).1 It might be considered as an indica-
tor of patriarchy in some families as well.
Unlike the groom who is most often identified by his first
name, the bride's forename is not always mentioned in the
wedding invitation. Instead, the brides are identified by the
title "dooshizeh" 2 (Miss) plus last name. This was observed
in 7.1% of the data and especially among religious middle-
class families.
This tendency (i.e. the deletion of the feminine proper names)
most likely indicates an inherent preference on the part of the
groom and the bride's families to avoid mentioning the names of
the females in the invitations, either for religious or personal
preferences. This practice is often witnessed among the nomadic
and rural wedding ceremonies and in conservative urban circles
as well as religiously-minded men. (Al-Ali, 2006, p. 708)
Accordingly, "calling a woman by her proper name is not
open to any male but is restricted to a socially identified cir-
cle (father, husband, brother, etc.)" (Al-Ali, 2006, p. 709).
Finally, 7.7% of the data were solely on the last name
basis, not using first names at all. This practice was observed
particularly among families of middle stratum most likely
due to the reason mentioned above.
Announcing the couple's marriage.This obligatory move
which, except for 4.2% of the data, appeared in third position
announces that the bride and the groom will soon be united
as man and wife exchanging marriage vows. Below are two
examples of this move:
1. ba tærænnom-e hæsti hæmrah mishævim væ peyman
mibændim ke hæmisheh asheq bemanim.
We join the melody of life and pledge to stay in love
with each other for ever.
2. dær aseman-e zendegi-e xod jostejugær-e setareh-i
budim be deræxshandegi-e xorshid væ yaftim ancheh
ra mixastim.
In the sky of our life, we were seeking after a star as bright
as the sun, and we found what we wished for.
Requesting the participation of the recipients. This element is,
in fact, an integral part of the wedding invitation genre that
enables the inviters, usually the bride and the groom, or
sometimes their parents to cordially and courteously request
the honor of the guests' participation in their celebration.
This move was identified in 84.3% of our corpus of analy-
sis, and in the rest of the data (15.7%) there was no explicit
Figure 1. A sample of the front page and decorative borders of
Persian wedding invitation cards.
Sharif and Yarmohammadi 5
request of participation as the function of this part is self-
explanatory, and sending wedding cards make the communi-
cative purpose of the genre self-evident.
It is also noteworthy that, within the corpus, 87.1% of the
wedding invitations were issued by the bride and the groom,
7.1% by their families, and finally 5.5% by their fathers. As
Cawasji Katrak (1965, p. 11) puts it, this is probably due to
the fact that since ancient times in Iran "the girl or the youth
[has] had the freedom to choose with the consent and
approval of parents her or his companion in life." Therefore,
issuing the invitation on the part of the marrying couple is a
good indicator of this liberty. On the other hand, some cou-
ples prefer their wedding invitations to be issued in the name
of their fathers or their parents for two reasons: first, "accord-
ing to Prophet Mohammad, there is no marriage without a
guardian" (Al-Ali, 2006, p. 700, quoting from Al-Asghalani,
n.d., p. 347); second, it is often the case that the funding for
the wedding is provided by the couple's families.
Identifying the bride and the groom by last name. This obliga-
tory move identifies the bride and the groom formally by
mentioning their last names. In 82.9% of the data, this move
was placed in the fifth position, while in 17.1% of the invita-
tions it occupied a second position.
It is often the case that the couple's first names and last
names are arranged in a crosswise manner resembling the
letter X, that is to say the bride's last name is written beneath
the groom's first name with the groom's surname placed
below the bride's first name. This might imply the fact that
the wedding is "to some extent an alliance not only of two

individuals but of two extended families" (Clynes & Henry,
2004, p. 228, citing from Haji Mohd Yussop Bakar, 2003).
Of the analyzed data, 25.7% manifested this criss-cross name
arrangement.
One point that attracted attention in the corpus was the
substitution of the couple's fathers'names, in their full forms,
for the couple's last names by 10% in the data to indicate the
people issuing the invitation. As in modern time the groom's
father or the bride's father or both sides communally finance
the marriage arrangements, the fathers are identified as the
inviters in the wedding cards.
Another point that was noteworthy was that 7.1% of the
cards used the titles Mr. and Miss prior to the couple's last
names. This was exclusively observed among middle-class
families.
Situating the wedding ceremony.This component move con-
tains explicit information regarding the day, the date, the
time and duration, the place of the wedding celebration, in
addition to the reception. These variants are all obligatory,
and always appear in the sixth position. An example of this
move is presented below:
1. pæzirayi: pænjshænbeh // æz saæt-e  ta pas-i æz shæb
be særf-e shirini væ sham
neshani: xiaban-e qæsrodæsht bashgah-e æfsæran
Reception: Thursday, 86.4.21 from 8 p.m. until the wee hours of
the night for refreshments and dinner
Address: Afsaran Club, Ghasrodasht St.
Each of these variants is going to be discussed in detail:
Day variant.Among the days of the week, Thursday and
Friday, in turn, had the highest frequencies of being selected
for the wedding ceremonies within the corpus of our study
(31.5% for the former and 15.7% for the latter). On Thurs-
days, working people in Iran work part-time; as a result,
Thursday evening is a convenient time to party all night long
and to take it easy the next day, on Friday, on which day
people are off from work. As mentioned before, in the ana-
lyzed data Friday had the second highest percentage due to
the very fact that it is a holiday in Iran and "a traditional day
to get married, according to Islamic tradition" (Al-Ali, 2006,
p. 703).
It is often the case that if religious holidays or occasions
in Iran happen to fall on a Saturday through a Wednesday
(i.e., the other days of the week except for Thursday and
Friday), marriage celebrations will be extremely frequent
then. As a matter of fact, a perfunctory glance at the calendar
revealed that this was especially true for our analyzed data.
This coincidence with a religious occasion is thought to
bring the marrying couple good luck, and it is believed that
they will be granted blessings if they begin their connubial
life together on a sacred day.
Date variant.In the Persian wedding cards studied,
besides the day of the week, there was a further specification
of the date that is based on the Muslim solar calendar (Hejri)
including the day, the month, and the year from right to left.
One point that was of special interest in the analyzed data
was that summer, with the frequency of occurrence of 42.8%,
was the Iranians' most favorite season for wedding festivals
as during the summer people have more spare time, and sum-
mer is the time of rejoicing, trips, parties, and so on.
Time and duration variant.As for the time and duration
variant, it must be pointed out that Persian wedding ritu-
als are usually held in the evening and take long for 5 or 6
hours on the average (see Figure 2). The formulaic phrase
ta pas-i æz shæb (until the wee hours of the night), which

sometimes appears in wedding invitations, might be an indi-
cator of a ceremony with lots of music and dancing. This
is while in rural areas, in northern part of the country, and
especially among the nomadic tribes weddings are some-
times celebrated early in the afternoon, and the guests are
invited to lunch (see Figure 3). In this study, 81.5% of the
cards identified the evening as their time variant, and 18.5%
of the invitations featured the afternoon for situating the time
of the ceremony.
Reception variant.
The reception variant immediately
follows the time and duration variants. Generally, wedding
guests in Iran are either invited for refreshments and dinner
(see Figure 2), or merely for refreshments. Occasionally, the
wedding reception is for refreshments and luncheon if the
wedding is celebrated in mid-day or early afternoon (see
Figure 3). Within our data, 87% of the invitations had been
made for refreshments and dinner, 10% for refreshments
only, and 3% for refreshments and lunch.
"The wedding refreshments will be the focal point for
many that attend the reception" (Brown, 2008, para. 1).
"Wedding receptions are often long and guests will be look-
ing forward to something they can eat or drink while making
conversation" (Judkins, n.d., para. 2). "Many wedding guests
will choose to attend the reception that follows the ceremony
because they know there will be entertainment and refresh-
ments" (Brown, 2008, para. 1).
Often candies and pastries, fruits, and sometimes tea,
juice, or ice cream are served as refreshments. More extrava-
gant weddings even serve coffee, nuts, dried fruits, finger
foods, or light snacks as refreshments. However, families
who are tight on budget usually cannot afford the high expen-
ditures of wedding feasts; therefore, they entertain their
guests by refreshments only. In Persian weddings, dinner is
served buffet style (Rezaei, 2009). "Jeweled rice, or sweet
rice is always served, along with many other dishes and an
elaborate wedding cake" (Batmanglij, 2004, para. 16).
Nowadays, the wedding refreshments and the feasts are pre-
pared by caterers who provide food and services for social
events.
Place variant.Except for those invitations that contain
optional components, other Persian wedding announcements
draw to a close with the place variant. In Iran, wedding cele-
brations are held in the residence of the groom's parents, gar-
dens, wedding halls, hotels' reception halls, or large houses.
As data analysis revealed, 34.3% of the Persian marriage
rituals took place in wedding halls, 28.5% in private gardens
or gardens specially prepared for wedding celebrations, and
37.2% in the groom's parental domicile or the house of a
relative. The address given usually includes the number and
the name of the street but not the name of the city or town.
Other optional components.The data analysis revealed that
almost 67.5% of the cards contained optional elements
including one or more of the following components.
One optional element that constituted 6% of our corpus
was an overt appeal to the invitees requesting them not to
bring video cameras of any kind to the wedding party for
religious considerations. Devout Muslim women would not
like others to take their photographs, for it is religiously pro-
hibited for men who are not close relatives to see the picture
of a woman without hijab (head covering).Atypical example
of this move has been presented below:
1. lotfæn æz aværdæn-e hær guneh durbin-e film-
bærdari xoddari konid.
Please avoid bringing video cameras of any kind.
Another optional component that appeared in the analyzed
wedding cards was the name of the publishing company
where the cards had been published, along with its address
or telephone number. This might be considered as a well-
publicized attempt on the part of the publishing companies
to advertise for their cards. 50% of our corpus of analysis
made a mention of the locale wherein the wedding cards had
been published. It is also worth mentioning that in some
cases, 3% in our data, the publishing companies wished the
newly-weds well congratulating them on their marriage.
The example of this move is as follows:
2. peyvænd-etan mobaræk.
Congratulations on your marriage!
Sometimes, a map is included in the wedding cards as well,
with arrows indicating the best route to the place where the
wedding celebration is held. 8.5% of the analyzed data con-
tained this optional component move.
The results of data analysis have been tabulated in Table 1
that appears in the appendix.
Conclusion
This study, adopting a genre analysis approach, has identi-
fied seven generic component moves based on which
Iranians, as members of a discourse community, construct
and interpret wedding invitation texts in the Persian lan-
guage. Of these identified moves appearing in a virtually
fixed order, the first (opening), third (announcing the cou-
ple's marriage), fifth (identifying the bride & the groom by
last name), and sixth (situating the wedding ceremony)
moves seemed to be obligatory, with the rest (identifying the
bride and the groom by first name, requesting the presence of
8 SAGE Open
the recipients, and other optional components) conceived of
as optional moves.
Furthermore, taking the verbal presentation and the visual
organization of the Persian wedding invitation cards into
account, attempts were made to explain each of the selec-
tions made on the part of the users in the construction of this
communicative event. The organizational details of this
communicative event are embedded in the cultural beliefs
and social values of the society in question. Focus on
socio-cultural norms related to wedding rituals has ascribed
the most influential role to religion in shaping the wedding
invitation genre in Persian in the way it is.
In summary, it would be worthwhile to compare and con-
trast similar genres across different cultures to come up with
their "universal or language specific tendencies," to use
Swales' (1990) terminology (p. 64). Finally, it is hoped that
the results of this study can be considered as a stride, though
trivial, toward cross-cultural understanding.

Notes
1. It must be noted that Al-Ali's (2006) study has to do with the
Jordanian society. As Jordan is a Muslim country, most of his
findings can be extended to the present study conducted in Iran
as an Islamic country as far as religious values are concerned.
However, we must bear in mind that there are certain culturally
bound differences between the two countries in question.
2. "dooshizeh," used as a title for the bride in Persian, is further
specified to refer to the chastity of the bride. The term is gener-
ally used for the bride's first marriage and is not common for
women who are remarrying.
