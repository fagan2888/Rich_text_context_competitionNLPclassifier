BACKGROUND: Although numerous studies have demonstrated obesity as an aspect of the insulin resistance
syndrome in cardiovascular disease (CVD), the mechanism is not clear. Central adiposity, acting through many
CVD risk factors, including, plasma glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and
lipoprotein moities-apolipoprotein B (ApoB), apolipoprotein A-I (ApoAI), by atherogenic and thrombotic mechanisms
has been proposed as a possible mechanism. In this study, we examined the relationship between central fat
distribution (de®ned by waist circumference) and the ratio of these lipoproteins (ApoBaApoAI).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Association between ApoBaApoAI ratio and waist circumference was compared in Blacks
(n  854) and Whites (n  2552) using the NHANES III population-based samples. Correlation analyses and multiple
regression analyses were used to determine the association between ApoBaApoAI and waist circumference,
controlling for age, body mass index (BMI), race, gender, plasma glucose, insulin, serum triglyceride and total
cholesterol.
RESULTS: Adjusting for age, ApoBaApoAI was signi®cantly correlated with waist circumference (Black men: r  0.38,
White men: r  0.26, Black women: r  0.20, White women: r  0.36) (all P ` 0.01). Adjusting for age and triglyceride or
insulin, waist circumference was also positively correlated with CVD risk factors including, ApoB, LDL-C, plasma
glucose and fasting insulin, and inversely correlated with ApoAI and HDL-C in Blacks and Whites (P ` 0.05). Overall,
triglyceride and total cholesterol were the strongest predictors of ApoBaApoAI in Blacks and Whites adjusting for age,
BMI and insulin, than waist girth (P ` 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The result of this study suggests the need to investigate ApoBaApoAI as another possible facet in the
insulin resistant syndrome.

Introduction
Although numerous epidemiological studies have
demonstrated that obesity is one facet of the insulin
resistance syndrome in cardiovascular disease (CVD),
the mechanism is not clear. It has been speculated that
through abnormal fat distribution (central adiposity),
obesity is a major factor in the pathological progres-
sion concluding in CVD.1 ± 3 The association between
adiposity and CVD is traditionally assessed by anthro-
pometric parameters such as the body mass index
(BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). BMI is a
height-independent measure of weight, often used as
a measure of body size and the degree of fatness, the
use of which is contentious due to its correlation with
fatness being not consistent across populations.4
Although WHR measures central fat deposition, it is
an imperfect measure of visceral fat mass, particularly
in lean individuals.5 Some studies have shown that
waist circumference may be a better predictor of CVD
than BMI and WHR.6 ± 8 Waist circumference is a
surrogate of total body and abdominal fat accumula-
tion, not accounted for by either BMI or WHR.8
Waist circumference is a better correlate of the
visceral adipose tissue than BMI or WHR.8 Visceral
adipose tissue is associated with the constellation of
factors comprising the insulin resistance syndrome,
which includes hyperinsulinaemia, glucose intoler-
ance, hypertension, hyperglyceridaemia and high
levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C).9
Some have postulated that the action of central
adiposity on CVD is through lipoprotein moities-
apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and apolipoprotein A-I
(ApoAI) by atherogenic and thrombotic mechan-
isms.10 ± 14 ApoAI is the activator of lecithin (choles-
terol acyltransferase) which esteri®es plasma
cholesterol that mobilizes residual cholesterol from
cells.15,16 ApoB aids in the delivery of cholesterol to
peripheral tissue.13,15,16
Several studies have demonstrated that ApoB,
ApoAI and triglyceride (TG) are independent risk
factors for CVD.10,15 ± 19 Hence, these lipoproteins
and TGs (triglycerols) are seen as another possible
aspect of the syndrome linking obesity with CVD.
Although an elevated ratio of ApoB and ApoAI
(ApoBaApoAI) has been found to be a powerful

index for discriminating between survivors of myo-
cardial infarction and controls, as well as an indepen-
dent risk factor for CVD,20,21 it has received only
limited consideration, particularly in terms of its
relationship with central fat distribution. Tradition-
ally, many studies investigating the association
between lipoproteins and CVD are often restricted to
their parent cholesterol (LDL-C and high-density
lipoprotein, HDL-C), although more and more studies
are now looking at TGs, apolipoproteins and their
molecular variants as potential risk factors for CVD.
The objectives of this investigation were twofold:
Firstly, examine and compare the relationship
between ApoBaApoAI and central fat distribution
(de®ned by waist circumference) in a biracial US
population sample, and secondly, to determine if the
relationships between ApoBaApoAI and waist cir-
cumference were affected by other variables including
age, BMI, plasma glucose, insulin, serum TG and total
cholesterol.
Methods
Data from the third US National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III) were used in this
investigation. NHANES III was a multistage prob-
ability sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian US
population groups, examined in two phases between
1988 ± 1994. The sampling and measurement proce-
dures have been described in detail elsewhere.19,22 ± 24
Only subjects aged 17 ± 90 y, who participated in
glucose analysis after an overnight fast, were eligible
for this investigation. Pregnant women and those on
insulin or hypoglycaemic agents were excluded from
analyses. This study was also restricted to individuals
for whom anthropometric variables, including age,
weight, height, waist and hip were obtained, and
also to those who were assayed for total cholesterol,
fasting insulin, serum ApoB, serum ApoAI and serum
TG. Waist measurement was made at the natural waist
or at the midpoint between the bottom of the rib cage
and the top of the iliac crest, for each subject at
minimal respiration to the nearest 0.1 cm. Detailed
methods used in measuring cholesterol, TG, HDL-C
and LDL-C cholesterol have been described else-
where.19,24 Brie¯y, ApoB and ApoAI were measured
by radial immunodiffusion in the ®rst 8.2% of the
specimens and by rate immunonephelometry for the
remaining.19 Based on the above criteria, a total of
3406 persons (854 Blacks and 2552 Whites) were
eligible for this investigation.
Statistical methods
Statistical programs available in SPSS for Windows
were utilized for these analyses.25 Means and standard
deviations for ApoBaApoAI and descriptive variables
were computed and compared across race and gender.
We used empirical waist cut-points ( ! 94.00 cm for
men and ! 80.00 cm for women) based on the study
by Lean et al,26 to compare mean values of
ApoBaApoAI across race and gender. Our justi®ca-
tion to use these cut points was due to the high degree
of agreement between the above waist circumference
values and BMI (BMI ! 25 kgam2) with speci®city
and sensitivity of 97.5% and 96%, respectively. With
the above cut points, Lean et al26 also found that waist
circumference identi®ed subjects with high WHR
( ! 0.95 for men and ! 0.80 for women) with 97.5%
and 96% speci®city and sensitivity, respectively. The
above BMI cut points are consistent with the World
Health Organization (WHO) recommendation, and the
WHR is within the range suggested by the US
Department of Agriculture (USDA) for Americans.
WHO speci®es a normal BMI as within 20 ± 25 kgam2
and the USDA recommends a WHR of 0.95 for men
and 0.80 for women, for determining risk of
CVDs.27,28
To obtain normality, TG values were log10
trans-
formed, prior to analyses. Gender and race speci®c
Pearson's correlation analysis was used to assess the
correlation between waist circumference and other
variables. Partial correlation analyses were also per-
formed to determine the association between
ApoBaApoAI and traditional CVD risk factors includ-
ing, plasma glucose, insulin, TG and total cholesterol,
controlled for age and BMI. Gender and race speci®c
multiple regression analysis with ApoBaApoAI as the
dependent variable and waist girth as the independent
variable, was used to determine the association
between ApoBaApoAI and waist circumference
adjusted for age, BMI, plasma glucose, insulin, TG
and total cholesterol. The customary P-values of 0.05
were used to specify statistical signi®cance.
Results
Table 1 describes the anthropometric and clinical
characteristics of the study participants. Although
Blacks were younger, they were signi®cantly heavier
as determined by weight and BMI (P ` 0.05). Overall,
the total cholesterol values for Blacks and Whites
were slightly elevated, but within clinically acceptable
values. Glucose, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C concentra-
tions were also within clinically desirable values for
both Whites and Blacks. The values of ApoBaApoAI
were signi®cantly higher among Whites compared to
Blacks and were greater among men than women. The
largest relative difference between men and women in
mean ApoBaApoAI was in White with a value of
0.10.
Mean values of ApoBaApoAI strati®ed by race,
gender and age, are presented in Figure 1. Overall,
White men and White women had signi®cantly higher
levels of ApoBaApoAI than Black men and Black

women, respectively, at each age group (P ` 0.05).
The pattern of ApoBaApoAI variation with age in
men and women, was the same in Black and White,
tending to increase with age with the highest values
occurring in White males in the 50 ± 59 y age group.
The lowest mean values of ApoBaApoAI were among
Black males and Black females aged ` 20 y, with
values of 0.60 each.
To describe gender and race speci®c trends in waist
and ApoBaApoAI values, we calculated mean values
of ApoBaApoAI, based on waist empirical cut-points
(Table 2). Among each waist quartile, White men had
larger waist sizes than Black men, while Black
women (except ®rst quartile) had larger waist sizes
than White women (P ` 0.01). There was a consistent
trend of increasing means of ApoBaApoAI with
increasing waist size for both men and women (test
for trends, P ` 0.001).
We also compared means of ApoBaApoAI across
empirical waist cut-points, recommended by Lean et
al.26 Subjects with `abnormal' waist circumference
( ! 94 cm for men and ! 80 cm for women) had
statistically higher values (0.87 and 0.74, for men
and women, respectively) of ApoBaApoAI compared
to normal (0.72 and 0.61 for men and women,

White men with abnormal waist circumference had
mean ApoBaApoAI values of 0.82 and 0.89, respec-
tively. Also, Black women and White women with
abnormal waist circumference had mean values of
ApoBaApoAI of 0.70 and 0.77, respectively. When
we adjusted for TG or insulin, these higher mean
values associated with critical waist circumference
persisted across race and gender.
Table 3 presents age-adjusted Pearson's correlation
coef®cients between waist circumference and
ApoBaApoAI, ApoAI, ApoB, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C,
glucose, insulin and total cholesterol by gender and
race. In the univariate correlation analysis, waist
circumference was positively correlated with
ApoBaApoAI, ApoB, TG, LDL, glucose, insulin and
total cholesterol in Black and White men and women
(P ` 0.05). Also, waist circumference was inversely
correlated with ApoAI and serum HDL-C cholesterol
in Blacks and Whites (P ` 0.01).
Due to the strong degrees of correlation for TG and
insulin, with waist circumference in the univariate
analyses, we adjusted for each, to determine their
independent effect on the association between waist
girth and ApoBaApoAI. When adjusted for TG, waist
circumference was positively correlated with
ApoBaApoAI, ApoB, LDL-C (except in Black
women), plasma glucose and insulin in Blacks and
Whites (P ` 0.01). Comparing the univariate models
with TG-adjusted models, there were decreases in the
values of ApoBaApoAI regression coef®cients by
23%, 42%, 43% and 35% for Black men, White
men, Black women and White women, respectively.
Further analyses were carried out, which adjusted for
fasting insulin. Again, waist girth was independently
related with ApoBaApoAI in Black men, White men,
Black women and White women (P ` 0.05). Com-
pared with TG adjusted analyses, serum LDL-C (in
Black men and Black women), plasma glucose (in
Black men) and ApoAI (in Black women) were no
longer signi®cant, while total cholesterol (in White
men and White women) and ApoB (in Black women),
became signi®cant in insulin adjusted analyses
(P ` 0.05). The degree of correlation between waist
circumference and insulin was higher than between
waist circumference and other variables in the TG and
non-TG adjusted models (P ` 0.01).
We performed gender and race-speci®c multiple
regression analyses using ApoBaApoAI as the depen-
dent variable and waist circumference as the indepen-
dent variable adjusting for age, BMI, plasma glucose,
insulin, TG and total cholesterol (Table 4). In both
Black men and White women, waist circumference
was independently and signi®cantly associated with
increasing ApoBaApoAI controlling for age, BMI,
plasma glucose, insulin, TG and total cholesterol
(P ` 0.05). Also, ApoBaApoAI was associated with

increased glucose values in Black men and White
women. Overall, TG and total cholesterol were inde-
pendently associated with increased ApoBaApoAI
values in Blacks and Whites, adjusting for waist
circumference, age, BMI and insulin (P ` 0.01). The
proportion of the variance of ApoBaApoAI explained
by the model that included age, BMI, glucose, insulin,
TG and total cholesterol were 39%, 45%, 44% and
44%, in Black men, White men, Black women and

Partial correlation coef®cients between
ApoBaApoAI and risk factors are presented in Table

ence in Black men (r  0.15; P ` 0.01). In all groups,
ApoBaApoAI was also correlated with traditional
CVD risk factors of total cholesterol (Black men:
r  0.46, P ` 0.01, White men: r  0.46, P ` 0.01,
Black women: r  0.57, P ` 0.01, White women:

women: r  0.14, P ` 0.01, White women: r  0.15,
P ` 0.01), and insulin (White women: r  0.08,
P ` 0.05).
To avoid bias, we repeated all analyses, excluding
those with medical conditions that might in¯uence
lipids, such as diabetes mellitus, coronary heart dis-
ease (CHD) and hypertension, as well as cigarette
smoking and alcohol use. Similar results of the inde-
pendent correlation between ApoBaApoAI and waist
circumference were observed (data not shown).
Discussion
Although obesity is one known factor in insulin
resistance syndrome,29 ± 31 its independent role in
CVD is not well understood. To investigate the role
of obesity, several investigators have de®ned different
forms of adiposity and their separate relationship to
CVD. Traditionally, BMI and WHR are the most
commonly used indices in the literature. Recent
investigations show, however, that waist circumfer-
ence as an absolute and aggregate measure of total fat
distribution, is a better risk factor for CVDs than
WHR or BMI. In fact, an analysis by Chan et al 32
shows that one can achieve a better discrimination of
CVD risks using waist girth, rather than using WHR
or BMI
The present investigation uses population-based to
provide information about the relationship between
central fat distribution, de®ned by waist circumfer-
ence and the ratio of two important apolipoproteins
that are known to be independent risk factors for
CVD. The mean values of ApoB for Black and
White men and women, were less than the cut
points suggested (ApoB ! 120 mgadl) to be asso-
ciated with increased risk of CVD.33 When we used
this cut point in our analyses, the prevalence rates of
ApoB ! 120 mgadl were 23%, 33%, 20% and 30%
for Black men, White men, Black women, and White
women, respectively. Based on the suggested34 value
of ` 120 mgadl, the prevalence rates of ApoAI were
13%, 23%, 9% and 11% for Black men, White men,
Black women and White women, respectively. These
individuals may be regarded as having abnormal
ApoB and ApoAI and at risk for CVD.33,34
Although abdominal adiposity has been hypothe-
sized to increase TG and TG is widely regarded as an
important factor in the enhanced and reduced produc-
tion of small LDL-C and HDL-C, respectively,35 ± 37
there are few studies that have adjusted for TG.
Except the three studies11,38,39 investigating ApoB
and ApoAI, to our knowledge there are no investiga-
tions using ApoBaApoAI, that adjusted for TG. Due
to the strong degrees of correlation of TG and insulin
with ApoBaApoAI in univariate analyses and because
hypertriglyceridaemia is frequently accompanied by a
state of insulin resistance,40 we adjusted for TG and
insulin, to account for their possible confounding
effect.
Although our data are cross-sectional and causality
cannot be established, we have shown that
ApoBaApoAI is positively correlated with abdominal
fat distribution in a biracial population sample, inde-
pendent of age. We have also shown that the correla-
tion persists, even after adjusting for TG or insulin. In
agreement with previous ®ndings,38,41 ± 43 our study
showed that increasing waist circumference was asso-
ciated with increased ApoB, TG, serum LDL-C,
plasma glucose, insulin and total cholesterol concen-
trations, and decreased concentrations of ApoAI and
serum HDL-C. We have also shown that TG and total
cholesterol were independently associated with
ApoBaApoAI, and were stronger predictors of
ApoBaApoAI in all four groups than waist girth,
BMI, glucose and insulin. For reasons yet to be
de®ned, the correlation between waist girth and
ApoBaApoAI was weaker and the association lacking
among White men and Black women compared to
Black men and White women.
Conclusion
Additional studies are needed to de®ne lifestyle
changes appropriate for reduction ApoBaApoAI
levels in these populations. The result of this study
suggests the need to investigate ApoBaApoAI as
another possible facet in the complexity of the so-
called insulin resistance syndrome.
