ABSTRACT. Background. All-terrain vehicles (ATVs)
have gained in popularity in recent years, and this rise in
use has been accompanied by increases in the number of
ATV-related injuries. Because children often lack the
physical strength, cognitive abilities, and fine motor
skills to operate ATVs properly, their risk for injury is
greater. Furthermore, most children ride adult-sized
ATVs.
Objectives. To estimate the numbers and rates of
ATV-related nonfatal injuries to riders aged <15 years
who were treated in hospital emergency departments
(EDs) in the United States from 2001 through 2003.
Methods. Estimates of ATV-related injuries were ob-
tained from the US Consumer Product Safety Commis-
sion's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-
All Injury Program. The database is a nationally
representative, stratified probability sample of 66 US
hospitals with >6 beds and a 24-hour ED. ATV-related
nonfatal injuries to riders aged <15 years who were
treated in hospital EDs were examined by age group,
gender, primary body part injured, diagnosis, and hospi-
tal admission status.
Results. From 2001 through 2003, an estimated
108 724 children aged <15 years were treated in hospital
EDs for nonfatal injuries sustained while riding ATVs.
The number of ATV-related injuries increased by 25%
over the 3-year period. Males aged 11 to 15 years ac-
counted for 52% of all ATV-related ED visits and hospi-
talizations among young riders. Children aged 0 to 5
years were more likely than the older children to have
facial injuries, whereas the older children were more
likely to sustain lower trunk and leg or foot injuries.
Fractures were the most common diagnosis, accounting
for 27% of ED visits and 45% of hospitalizations.
Conclusions. Current legal and regulatory standards
have been ineffective in reducing injuries among young
ATV riders. Renewed efforts by health care providers to
counsel parents about the injury risk to children who
ride ATVs and advocate for more stringent state-level
minimum age requirements may help reduce the escalat-
ing rates of ATV-related injuries among young riders.

All-terrain vehicles (ATVs) are motorized, gas-
oline-powered vehicles that generally weigh
between 300 and 600 lb, with oversized, low-
pressure tires, a seat designed to be straddled by the
user, and handlebars for steering. These vehicles are
designed for use by riders on off-road, nonpaved
terrain. ATVs have gained in popularity in recent
years, and this rise in use has been accompanied by
increases in the number of deaths and injuries.1,2 A
recent report by the US Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC) noted that the number of ATV-
related injuries treated in hospital emergency depart-
ments (EDs) has risen annually for the past 11 years
from 49 800 in 1993 to 125 500 in 2003.3 Children
aged 15 years accounted for 31% of ATV-related
ED visits in 2003. The current report describes the
ATV-related nonfatal injuries to riders aged 15
years who were treated in hospital EDs during 2001­
2003.
METHODS
National estimates for ATV-related injuries were obtained from
the CPSC's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System
(NEISS)-All Injury Program. This database is a nationally repre-
sentative, stratified probability sample of 66 US hospitals with 6
beds and a 24-hour ED. The data are abstracted from medical
charts for initial ED visits related to injuries, consumer products,
or both. We reviewed the narrative portion of each record to
exclude cases in which the patient was not injured while riding on
an ATV (eg, patient injured while unloading an ATV from a truck
or while being pulled on a sled behind an ATV) and cases in which
the medical record did not clearly indicate whether the child had
been riding an ATV at the time of the injury (n  258). Data from
the included cases were weighted by the inverse of the probability
of selection to produce national estimates.4 We calculated annu-
alized estimates of injuries on the basis of weighted data for 1563
ATV-related injuries among young riders treated in EDs during
2001­2003 using US Census Bureau population estimates for the
corresponding years.5 A direct variance estimation procedure was
used to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and account for
the complex sample design.4 The diagnosis and primary body part
injured were classified according to the most severe presenting
injury.6 The distributions of diagnosis and primary body part
injured by age presented in Table 2 and the distribution of hospi-
talization by age and primary body part injured presented in the
results are based on the unweighted data, because some of the cell
counts were 20.

RESULTS
Estimates and Rates
From 2001 through 2003, an estimated 108 724 chil-
dren aged 15 years were treated in hospital EDs for
nonfatal injuries sustained while riding ATVs. The
number of ATV-related injuries increased from
32 280 (95% CI: 21 418 to 43 142) in 2001 to 40 403
(95% CI: 31 144 to 49 662) in 2003 overall, which
reflects an increase of 12% in both 2002 and 2003. The
age and gender of the children treated, the charac-
teristics of their injuries, and the rates of hospitaliza-
tion were similar for all 3 years of the study period.
The annualized ATV-related injury rate was 56 per
100 000 persons (95% CI: 42 to 71) (Table 1). The
injury rate was higher among males (77 per 100 000
males; 95% CI: 57 to 98) than females (34 per 100 000
females; 95% CI: 26 to 42). Injuries among riders aged
11 to 15 years accounted for 71% of ATV-related
injuries among children; 74% of the injured riders
aged 11 to 15 years were male. Eighty-seven percent
of children with ATV-related injuries were treated
and released from the ED.
Diagnosis
Fractures and contusions or abrasions were the
most common injuries, together accounting for 52%
of all ED visits for ATV-related injuries among
young riders (Table 1). Based on the unweighted
data, fractures were more common among the older
age groups, accounting for 29% of ED visits among
children aged 11 to 15 years, 26% of visits among
children aged 6 to 10 years, and 22% of visits among
children aged 0 to 5 years. Lacerations were most
common among children aged 0 to 5 years, account-
ing for 29% of their ED visits (Table 2). The distribu-
tion of diagnosis was similar for both genders.
Primary Body Part Injured
The body part with the most severe injury varied
by age (Table 2). Based on the unweighted data,
children aged 0 to 5 years were twice as likely as
children aged 6 to 10 years and nearly 5 times as
likely as those aged 11 to 15 years to injure their face
or mouth. Lower trunk and lower extremity injuries
were more common in the 2 older age groups. The
distribution of body part injured was similar for both
genders.
Disposition
Twelve percent of children with ATV-related inju-
ries who were treated in EDs were admitted to a
hospital. Males aged 11 to 15 years accounted for
52% of all hospital admissions for ATV-related inju-
ries among children. Compared with ED visits for all
injuries among children aged 0 to 15, those with
ATV-related injuries were 5 times as likely to be
hospitalized (12.3% vs 2.4%; P  .001). Seventeen
percent of children aged 0 to 5 years were hospital-
ized, compared with 14% of children aged 6 to 10
years and 11% of children aged 11 to 15 years. Chil-
dren diagnosed with a fracture accounted for the
largest proportion of hospitalizations (45%), fol-
lowed by children with internal injuries (24%). Inju-
ries to the head, face, or neck accounted for 38% of
hospitalizations, and injuries to the leg or foot ac-
counted for 27% of hospitalizations. Based on the
unweighted data, hospitalization for injuries to the
head, face, or neck was more common among chil-
dren in the younger age groups (0­5 and 6­10 years),
accounting for approximately half of the hospitaliza-
tions in each age group, compared with 38% of hos-
pitalizations for children aged 11 to 15 years.
DISCUSSION
From 2001 through 2003 in the United States, the
estimated number of children aged 0 to 15 years who
sought care at hospital EDs for nonfatal injuries sus-
tained while riding ATVs increased by 25% from
32 280 to 40 403. Males aged 11 to 15 years accounted
for more than half of all ATV-related injuries among
children. Fractures were the most common diagno-
sis, accounting for 27% of ED visits. Children aged 0
to 5 years were more likely than those aged 6 to 15
years to have facial injuries, whereas the older chil-
dren were more likely to sustain lower trunk and leg
or foot injuries.
Each year, 4450 (12%) of the children treated in
hospital EDs for ATV-related injuries were hospital-
ized. Compared with ED visits for all types of inju-
ries among children in this age group, those with
ATV-related injuries were 5 times as likely to be
hospitalized. Males aged 11 to 15 years accounted for
52% of the hospitalizations for ATV-related injuries
among children. Fractures were the most common
diagnosis, accounting for 45% of hospitalizations.
The estimates presented in this report include only
children who were injured while riding an ATV. In
each of the 3 study years, 2500 children were in-
jured by an ATV that they were not riding or that the
medical record did not clearly indicate that they
were riding. Common scenarios for injuries to non-
riders included being struck by an ATV ridden by
someone else, being injured while loading or unload-
ing an ATV, or being injured by a stationary ATV
(eg, injuring the foot while trying to kick-start an
ATV). The occupant status of the injured child was
missing for a substantial number of cases in which a
child was run over by an ATV. These cases were
excluded from this report. It is likely, however, that
some of these children had been riding the ATV
before it ran over them.
The estimates presented here differ somewhat
from the estimates provided by the CPSC in its 2003
annual report of ATV-related deaths and injuries.3
For example, for 2003, the CPSC estimated that
38 600 children aged 15 years were treated in hos-
pital EDs for ATV-related injuries, compared with
our estimate of 40 403 injured ATV riders of the same
age. This difference in estimates is possible for sev-
eral reasons. The CPSC estimates include all ATV-
related injuries regardless of whether the child was
operating the ATV.3 The CPSC estimates are derived
from reports of a probability sample of 100 NEISS
hospitals, whereas the estimates presented in this
report are derived from a subsample of 66 hospitals
that participate in the NEISS-All Injury Program.4 In
addition, the CPSC adjusts its estimates downward

e610 ATV-RELATED NONFATAL INJURIES AMONG YOUNG RIDERS
by 8% to account for cases that are coded incor-
rectly as being ATV related,3 whereas we reviewed
each record and made exclusions on a case-by-case
basis.
There are several limitations to the findings in this
report. The NEISS provides national estimates and
does not allow for estimates by region, state, or local
jurisdiction. Furthermore, some geographic regions
with relatively high ATV injury rates may not be
adequately represented in the NEISS. For example,
Alaska and West Virginia, states with high ATV-
related pediatric mortality rates, are not represent-
ed.7,8 The NEISS includes information about only the
most severe injury based on the physician's assess-
ment. Information about the rider's position on the
ATV (eg, driver, passenger) was not available for
71% of riders, and there was no information on the
size of the ATV or the rider's frequency of ATV use,
level of experience, or helmet use. Finally, because
the NEISS does not include children treated in phy-
sician offices or clinics, the actual annual number of
ATV-related injuries among young riders is likely to
be higher than the estimates presented here.
The most recent national survey of ATV riders
estimated that in 2001, 7.2 million children aged 15
years had ridden an ATV at least once in the previ-
ous year. Eighty-five percent of the children who had
driven ATVs drove ones with engines 90 mL (ie,
adult-sized ATVs).2 Furthermore, 87% of the chil-
dren who were injured while driving ATVs were
driving adult-sized ATVs. This pattern of children
operating adult-sized ATVs persists despite recom-
mendations by the CPSC and some ATV distributors
that children aged 15 years not ride adult-sized
ATVs.9
Because children often lack the physical strength,
cognitive abilities, and fine motor skills to operate
ATVs properly, their risk for injury is greater.10 A
national case-control study estimated that ATV driv-
ers aged 15 years were nearly 4 times as likely as
older drivers to be injured.11 Because of the increased
risk of injury to children, coupled with the propen-
sity for children to ride adult-sized ATVs, some med-
ical and consumer advocacy organizations, including
the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American
Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, and the Con-
sumer Federation of America, recommend prohibit-
ing all use of ATVs by children 15 years old.12­15 In
August 2002, the Consumer Federation of America
filed a petition with the CPSC requesting that the
commission ban the sale of adult-sized ATVs for use
by children 16 years old.16 In February 2005, the
CPSC staff recommended that the commission deny
the petition, citing that the impact of such a ban
would be limited because major ATV distributors
already require dealers not to sell adult-sized ATVs
for use by children. Moreover, the ban would not
apply to sales of used ATVs, which account for 37%
of all ATV sales.17 The commission heard testimony
regarding the petition on March 22, 2005. In June
2005, CPSC Chairman Hal Stratton directed the staff
to review all existing ATV safety standards, particu-
larly as they relate to young riders (H. Stratton,
CPSC, memorandum to review ATV standards, per-
sonal communication, June 8, 2005).
Most states have some laws or regulations govern-
ing the use of ATVs. According to the Specialty
Vehicle Institute of America, 28 states have mini-
mum age requirements.18 These regulations apply to
young riders aged 10 to 18 years and include a wide
variety of qualifiers such as where ATVs can be
operated and exceptions for age requirements if the
child is supervised by an adult or has a safety certif-
icate. The effectiveness of state-imposed require-
ments for operating ATVs in reducing serious inju-
ries and deaths among young riders is unclear.
Upperman and colleagues7 examined the issue and
found no difference in ATV-related mortality rates
among children between states with and without
minimum age requirements and safety certification.

seriously injured ATV riders aged 15 years from a

state with ATV regulations versus one without and
found that children from the state without regula-
tions were younger and less likely to have been
wearing a helmet. Finally, Helmkamp8 found that
the presence of some level of ATV regulation and
helmet-use requirement is associated with lower
ATV-related mortality rates in the overall popula-
tion.
Despite placement of decals with safety warnings
on all new ATVs and recommendations for restricted
use by children from the CPSC and medical associ-
ations, parents continue to obtain ATVs for their
children's use. Most children ride adult-sized ATVs,
and there is currently no federal mandate restricting
the sale of adult-sized ATVs for use by children.
Renewed efforts by health care providers to counsel
parents about the injury risk to children who use
ATVs and advocate for more stringent state-level
minimum age requirements may help reduce the
escalating numbers of ATV-related injuries occurring
among young riders.7,10,19­21
