Cadmium is a heavy metal found in the
earth's crust that is disseminated in the envi-
ronment both by natural processes and by
human activities such as fossil fuel burning,
waste incineration, smelting procedures, and
the use of phosphate fertilizers (Agency for
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 2008).
Uptake of environmental cadmium in plants
and animals results in human exposures via
food or tobacco smoke, and occupational
exposures can occur as well [European Food
Safety Authority (EFSA) 2009]. Cadmium
is known to be nephrotoxic (EFSA 2009),
but there is also a growing body of evidence
suggesting that cadmium exposure may have
adverse neurodevelopmental consequences.
Several animal studies have reported
effects of cadmium on electrophysiologi-
cal parameters, markers of neurotransmit-
ter function, and neurobehavioral outcomes
(Ali et al. 1986; Desi et al. 1998; Lehotzky
et al. 1990; Nagymajtenyi et al. 1997; Nation
et al. 1983, 1984, 1989, 1990). Studies in
children have reported associations between
higher cadmium levels and mental retarda-
tion (Jiang et al. 1990; Marlowe et al. 1983),
decreased verbal IQ (Thatcher et al. 1982),
lower neuropsychological test performance
(Bonithon-Kopp et al. 1986; Stellern et al.
1983), learning disability (LD) (Capel et al.
1981; Ely et al. 1981; Pihl and Parkes 1977),
poor reading performance (Thatcher et al.
1984b), neurophysiological evoked poten-
tial differences (Thatcher et al. 1984a), and
behavioral problems in the presence of con-
currently elevated lead levels (Marlowe et al.
1985a). In contrast, other human studies
have failed to detect significant multivari-
able-adjusted associations between markers of
cadmium exposure and neurodevelopmental
outcomes (Cao et al. 2009; Gillberg et al.
1982; Lee et al. 2007; Marlowe et al. 1985b;
Moon et al. 1985; Wright et al. 2006). These
studies varied in size, quality, and design. In
addition, they used several different expo-
sure metrics, evaluated different windows of
susceptibility, and differed in their consider-
ation of potentially important confounders.
These factors may help explain the inconsis-
tent results, and further research could help
resolve some of the discrepancies.
In this study, we analyzed a large repre-
sentative sample of U.S. children 6­15 years
of age from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES),
to determine whether higher levels of urinary
cadmium were associated with attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), LD,
or placement in special education. To our
knowledge, this is the largest study to evalu-
ate associations between urinary cadmium
and neurodevelopmental outcomes, and the
first to do so in a nationally representative
sample of U.S. children.
Methods
Data source and study population. NHANES
is an ongoing series of cross-sectional question-
naires, examinations, and laboratory analyses
that evaluate nutritional and environmental
exposures as well as various health parameters
in the U.S. population [Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention National Center for
Health Statistics (CDC-NCHS) 2010b].
Detailed documentation on NHANES is
available online (CDC-NCHS 2010b). For
this study we used NHANES data collected
1999­2004. We restricted our analyses to
children 6­15 years of age because urinary
cadmium was evaluated in a subsample of
participants  6 years of age, and informa-
tion on several covariates was not available
for participants > 15 years of age. There were
2,282 children between 6 and 15 years of age
in this subsample, and urine cadmium mea-
surements were available for 2,199 (96.4%)
of these. Because some children were miss-
ing outcome data, 2,189, 2,196, and 2,195
children were included in the analyses of LD,
special education, and ADHD, respectively.
The NHANES website notes that approval
(protocol 98-12) was obtained from the
NCHS Ethics Review Board (referred to as
the NHANES Institutional Review Board
before 2003) (CDC-NCHS 2012).
Exposure assessment. Cadmium exposure
was assessed using urinary cadmium concen-
tration, which is an indicator of body burden/

Background: Low-level environmental cadmium exposure in children may be associated with
adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.
Objective: Our aim was to evaluate associations between urinary cadmium concentration and
reported learning disability (LD), special education utilization, and attention deficit hyper
activity
disorder (ADHD) in U.S. children using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) data.
Methods: We analyzed data from a subset of participants in NHANES (1999­2004) who were
6­15 years of age and had spot urine samples analyzed for cadmium. Outcomes were assessed by
parent or proxy-respondent report. We fit multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models to esti-
mate associations between urinary cadmium and the outcomes.
Results: When we compared children in the highest quartile of urinary cadmium with those in the
lowest quartile, odds ratios adjusted for several potential confounders were 3.21 [95% confidence
interval (CI): 1.43, 7.17] for LD, 3.00 (95% CI: 1.12, 8.01) for special education, and 0.67 (95%
CI: 0.28, 1.61) for ADHD. There were no significant interactions with sex, but associations with
LD and special education were somewhat stronger in males, and the trend in the ADHD analysis
was only evident among those with blood lead levels above the median.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that children who have higher urinary cadmium concentra-
tions may have increased risk of both LD and special education. Importantly, we observed these
associations at exposure levels that were previously considered to be without adverse effects, and
these levels are common among U.S. children.

cumulative cadmium exposure (Lauwerys
et al. 1994). Urinary cadmium concentra-
tion was determined by inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and
details are accessible online via the NHANES
website (CDC-NCHS 2010b). The limit of
detection (LOD) was 0.06 g/L, and cad-
mium concentrations below the LOD were
imputed as the LOD divided by the square
root of 2. Of the 2,199 participants, 222
(10%) had urinary cadmium concentrations
below the LOD. Cadmium (Cd) concentra-
tions were corrected for interference from tin
(Sn) and molybdenum (Mo), because these
elements can produce ICP-MS signals (114Sn,
98Mo16O+, 96Mo18O+, 97Mo17OH+) that
overlap with 114Cd (CDC-NCHS 2010b;
Jarrett et al. 2008). Cadmium concentrations
that were below zero after molybdenum cor-
rection were left-truncated and listed as zero.
Urinary creatinine is often used to correct
for the variation in chemical concentration
that is attributable to variation in urine dilu-
tion when exposure estimates are based on
spot urine samples (Barr et al. 2005). Because
creatinine enters urine at a fairly constant rate,
urine creatinine concentration is inversely
proportional to urine flow rate and can be
used to correct for differences in urine flow
rate (Barr et al. 2005). In this study urine
creatinine levels were determined via a Jaffé
rate reaction with a Beckman Synchron CX3
Clinical Analyzer (Beckman Instruments,
Inc., Brea, CA, USA) (CDC-NCHS 2010b).
As recommended by Barr et al. (2005), we
included urine creatinine concentration as an
independent covariate in the regression mod-
els rather than using the ratio of cadmium
to creatinine (creatinine standardization),
because this approach should be less likely
to produce biased effect estimates (Barr et al.
2005; Schisterman et al. 2005).
Outcomes. Assessment of neuro
develop
mental outcomes was based on responses
of parent, guardian, or other adult proxy
responder (CDC-NCHS 2010b). For chil-
dren < 12 years of age, LD status was assessed
with the following question: "Has a repre-
sentative from a school or health professional
ever told [you] that [the child] had a learning
disability?"; ADHD status was assessed as fol-
lows: "Has a doctor or health professional
ever told [you] that [the child] had atten-
tion deficit disorder?" For those  12 years
of age, the same questions were asked about
LD and ADHD but the bracketed words
were replaced with: [the child] and [he/she].
Special education utilization was assessed with
the same question regardless of the child's age:
"Does [the child] receive Special Education or
Early Intervention Services?"
Covariates. Data on many potential con-
founders were available in NHANES (CDC-
NCHS 2010b). We considered the following
covariates in our analyses: age (years), sex,
race/ethnicity [non-Hispanic white (referent),
non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, other
Hispanic, other race (including multiracial)],
maternal age at birth of child (years), atten-
dance at preschool/daycare (yes/no), health
insurance coverage (yes/no), receipt of neo-
natal intensive care unit or special newborn
care (yes/no), low birth weight (< 2,500 g;
yes/no), poverty income ratio (the ratio of
family income to the federal poverty threshold;
ratios  5 are listed as 5), education level of
the household reference person (highest grade
achieved: less than 9th grade, at least 9th grade
but no high school diploma, high school grad-
uate/GED (general educational development)
degree or equivalent, some college or associate
of arts degree, and college graduate or above),
blood lead level (micrograms per deciliter),
low hemoglobin level for age and sex (< 10th
percentile,  10th percentile; used as a proxy
for iron deficiency), report of a smoker in the
home (yes/no), serum cotinine (nanograms
per milliliter), prenatal smoke exposure (i.e.,
the child's mother smoked while pregnant;
yes/no), and, as mentioned above, urine creati-
nine (milligrams per deciliter). Detailed infor-
mation on the covariates is available online
(CDC-NCHS 2010b).
Statistical analysis. Analyses were con-
ducted using SAS (version 9.1.3; SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC). We obtained national preva-
lence estimates for the outcomes by using the
SURVEYMEANS procedure, specifying strata,
cluster, and weight variables to account for the
complex sampling design characteristics of
NHANES (CDC-NCHS 2010a, 2010b). For
each of the three outcomes, we estimated the
relative odds of each outcome across quartiles
of urinary cadmium concentration. To do this
we fit multivariable-adjusted logistic regres-
sion models with the SURVEYLOGISTIC
procedure, again specifying strata, cluster,
and weight variables (CDC-NCHS 2010a,
2010b). Urinary cadmium was evaluated in
quartiles in order to allow for the detection of
non
linear dose­response relationships, reduce
the potential excess influence of data from
children with very high cadmium concentra-
tions on the effect estimates, and alleviate con-
cerns about low cadmium levels in the context
of molybdenum correction and left truncation
of urinary cadmium levels at zero (when cor-
rection resulted in a cadmium concentration
below zero).
We constructed three main models:
a) logistic regression models relating urinary
cadmium to each outcome adjusting only for
urinary creatinine; b) core models adjusted
for urinary creatinine, age, sex, blood lead,
smoker in the home, serum cotinine, prenatal
smoke exposure (mother smoked while preg-
nant), and poverty income ratio; and c) full
models also adjusted for additional covariates
of a priori interest that predicted outcomes
(p < 0.10) in bivariate logistic regression mod-
els. Continuous and discrete covariates were
modeled as single linear terms, except for
hemoglobin levels. Low hemoglobin levels
are a proxy for iron deficiency (Zimmermann
2008). Because normal hemoglobin levels vary
by age and sex (Ahsan and Noether 2011), we
modeled hemoglobin in categories (< 10th
percentile or  10th percentile for the age and
sex of the participant).
Prior studies have suggested an interaction
between cadmium exposure and sex in rela-
tion to LD, as well as an interaction between
cadmium exposure and lead exposure in
relation to ADHD (Ely et al. 1981; Nation
et al. 1989, 1990). We evaluated cadmium­
sex and cadmium­lead interactions in the
fully adjusted models by including product
interaction terms with cadmium modeled as
an ordinal trend variable (coded as 0, 1, 2,
or 3 based on the quartile of exposure) to
obtain pvalues for each interaction. For the

cadmium­lead interaction, lead was also mod-
eled as an ordinal trend variable. To obtain a
single (summary) effect estimate for urinary
cadmium with each outcome, we evaluated
this cadmium quartile trend variable in the
fully adjusted models. We also evaluated this
cadmium quartile trend variable in the fully
adjusted models (with the sex or blood lead
term removed) within strata defined by sex or
blood lead level (above/below median). In our
analyses statistical significance was defined as
p < 0.05 or a 95% confidence interval (CI)
that excluded the null.
Results
History of LD was reported for 12.6%
(276 of 2,189) of the study population,
and participation in special education was
reported for 10.5% (231 of 2,196). History
of ADHD diagnosis was reported for 9.0%
(198 of 2,195) of the study population. The
co-
occurrence of the outcomes is shown in
Figure 1. Accounting for the complex sur-
vey design characteristics of NHANES, the
estimated lifetime prevalence among U.S.
children 6­15 years of age was 12.6% for
LD (95% CI: 9.5%, 15.7%), 11.7% for spe-
cial education participation (95% CI: 9.5%,
13.9%), and 11.5% for ADHD (95% CI:
8.5%, 14.5%). Urinary cadmium concentra-
tions followed an approximately log-normal
distribution, with a median of 0.11 g/L, an
interquartile range (IQR) of 0.06­0.18 g/L,
and a range of 0.00­14.94 g/L. Urinary
cadmium concentrations by covariate level
are listed in Table 1. Urinary cadmium con-
centrations were generally higher among
non-Hispanic black and Mexican-American
children than among white children, and
higher among children from more impov-
erished households or households where
Ciesielski et al.

the reference person had lower educational
achievement (Table 1). Children with LD and
children who participated in special educa-
tion had higher median urinary cadmium lev-
els, whereas children with ADHD had lower
median urinary cadmium levels (Table 2).
Children in the two highest quartiles of
urinary cadmium concentration had higher
odds of LD and special education in both
the creatinine-adjusted and fully adjusted
analy
ses (Table 3). In contrast, children in the
three highest quartiles of urinary cadmium
concentration had lower odds of ADHD in
the both the creatinine-adjusted and fully
adjusted analyses (Table 3). When we com-
pared children in the highest quartile of urine
cadmium concentration with those in the
lowest quartile, the fully adjusted odds ratios
(ORs) were 3.21 (95% CI: 1.43, 7.17) for
LD, 3.00 (95% CI: 1.12, 8.01) for special
education, and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.28, 1.61) for
ADHD. Adding a term for low hemoglobin
level to the fully adjusted models had little
effect on these ORs and did not change the
significance conclusions (data not shown).
ORs from core models adjusted only for uri-
nary creatinine, age, sex, blood lead, smoker
in the home, serum cotinine, prenatal smoke
exposure (mother smoked while pregnant),
and poverty income ratio were similar: 3.50
(95% CI: 1.56, 7.88) for LD, 2.66 (95% CI:
1.07, 6.63) for special education, and 0.65
(95% CI: 0.28, 1.51) for ADHD.
When urinary cadmium was modeled with
an ordinal tend variable (coded as 0, 1, 2, or 3
based on the quartile of exposure), the fully
adjusted ORs for a one-quartile increase in
urinary cadmium were 1.51 (95% CI: 1.14,
2.00) for LD, 1.44 (95% CI: 1.03, 2.01) for
special education, and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.61,
1.16) for ADHD (Table 4). In sex-stratified
analyses, the corresponding ORs for LD and
special education were somewhat larger among
males than among females [for LD, 1.75 (95%
CI: 1.24, 2.46) vs. 1.24 (95% CI: 0.75, 2.04)
and for special education, 1.73 (95% CI: 1.02,
2.92) vs. 1.31 (95% CI: 0.81, 2.13)]. In blood
lead­stratified analyses, the corresponding OR
for ADHD was 1.11 (95% CI: 0.65, 1.91)
for those with lead levels below the median
and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.52, 1.03) for those
with lead above the median. However, these
interactions were not significant (p = 0.71 for

cadmium­sex in the LD analysis, p = 0.43 for

cadmium­sex in the special education analy-
sis, and p = 0.43 for cadmium­lead in the
ADHD analysis), and none of the remaining

cadmium­sex or 
cadmium­lead inter
action
terms were significant.
Discussion
LD and special education. We observed that
children in the highest quartile of urinary cad-
mium had significantly higher odds of both
LD and special education when compared
with those in the lowest quartile. A few prior
studies have linked cadmium exposure with
LD, and these studies relied on hair and blood
samples to assess cadmium exposure. Two
case­control studies demonstrated higher hair
cadmium concentrations in children with LD
(Capel et al. 1981; Pihl and Parkes 1977). A
third study also found higher hair cadmium
concentrations in children with LD, but the
difference was statistically significant only
for males (Ely et al. 1981). In that study, the
authors considered the sexes separately but did
not present the type of statistical evaluation for
interaction that we report here. Interestingly,
in our study the sex­cadmium interaction
was not significant, but the effect estimate for
urinary cadmium was larger among males. A
fourth study reported no association between
LD and blood cadmium in the 1999­2000
NHANES data (Lee et al. 2007). Cadmium
accumulates in the kidney, and urinary cad-
mium concentration is considered to be a
marker of cumulative exposure/body burden,
whereas blood cadmium is thought to be a
better indicator of recent exposure (Lauwerys
et al. 1994). The different exposure metric
used in the Lee et al. (2007) study may help
explain the discrepancy in our findings.
In addition to higher odds of LD, we
found that children in the highest quartile
of urinary cadmium also had higher odds of

special education placement. Special education
is a "catch-all" outcome that likely involves
a variety of neurocognitive and behavioral
dysfunctions, including LDs such as reading
difficulties, dyslexia, ADHD, and language/
communication disorders, as well as behavior
problems, psychiatric conditions, and per-
haps some physical dysfunctions. The broad
heterogeneous nature of both special educa-
tion and LD as outcome measures prevents
inferences about specific learning or cognitive
domains. We are not aware of prior epide-
miologic studies directly relating cadmium
exposure and special education. However,
any of the previously mentioned animal or
human studies that link cadmium exposure
to adverse neurobehavioral/neurocognitive or
general health outcomes may be relevant here,
because these outcomes could lead to special
education placement.
There are data supporting the biological
plausibility of cadmium exposure as a risk
factor for LD and special education place-
ment. For example, cadmium can inhibit the
calcium flux required for neurotransmitter
release (Hirning et al. 1988; Nation et al.
1989) and might thereby disrupt the neural
communication required for synaptic network
formation during development. Cadmium
has also been shown to influence the prolif-
eration and differentiation of neuroblasts in
culture (Gulisano et al. 2009), and there is
evidence that cadmium could indirectly affect
the developing brain by disrupting thyroid
hormone function (Iijima et al. 2007).
ADHD. Our findings for ADHD did not
reach statistical significance, but the direc-
tion of the association suggests a possible
decreased risk of ADHD diagnosis in children
with urinary cadmium levels above the 25th
percentile. There is only limited information
from prior epidemiologic studies on cadmium
exposure and ADHD/executive function. Lee
et al. (2007) reported a non
significant trend
of increasing odds of ADHD with increasing
blood cadmium levels that was not present
after adjustment for persistent organic pol-
lutants based on an analysis of 1999­2000
NHANES data. As mentioned above, the dif-
ferent exposure metrics may partly explain the
difference in our findings, because blood cad-
mium is a marker of recent exposure, whereas
urine cadmium is a marker of chronic expo-
sure (Lauwerys et al. 1994). Cao et al. (2009)
reported a non
significant trend of increasing
problem behavior scores at 7 years of age with
increasing blood cadmium levels measured
at 2 years of age, but there were no obvious
trends with increasing blood cadmium in the
attention/executive subdomains, the hyper
activity subdomain, or the ADHD index. The
prospective approach is a strength of their
study, but their unique population consisted
solely of lead-poisoned children (blood lead
levels of 20­44 g/dL at enrollment), and the
results may not be generalizable to non-lead-
poisoned children.
Previous animal-based studies have dem-
onstrated a variety of seemingly inconsistent
effects of cadmium exposure on neurophysiol-
ogy and activity levels. These findings include,
for example, reduced exploratory activity
and decreased time spent moving, but they
also include hyperactivity, and evidence of
changes in central nervous system dopamine
and serotonin metabolism (Ali et al. 1986;
Desi et al. 1998; Nation et al. 1989, 1990).
These two neurotransmitter systems have been
implicated in the etiology of ADHD (Faraone
et al. 2005). The varied direction of effects
on activity level seen in the animal literature
might be related to differences in the timing
of cadmium exposure during neurodevelop-
ment, the presence of other uncontrolled vari-
ables, and/or the specific phenotype measured
in each study. We lack detailed information
on exposure timing, which makes it diffi-
cult to interpret the direction of the ORs for
ADHD in the context of the animal litera-
ture (Andersen and Navalta 2004). If elevated
cadmium exposure decreased activity levels,
this may have made ADHD diagnosis less
likely. It is also possible that cadmium may
cause other neurocognitive dysfunctions that
serve as competing risks to ADHD diagno-
sis (perhaps children with other diagnostic
labels were less likely to receive an ADHD
label), and the potential influence of chance
should not be overlooked. Because these are
cross-sectional data, the temporal relationship

between exposure and outcome is not dis-
cernable, and it is possible that urinary cad-
mium concentration tended to decrease after
ADHD diagnosis (e.g., children with ADHD
may be more likely to have behaviors that
decrease cadmium exposure, absorption, or
excretion). In the lead-stratified analysis, we
found evidence that the OR for ADHD is
< 1 only among those with blood lead levels
above the median. The interaction was not
significant, but there is toxicologic evidence
that cadmium exposure may attenuate lead-
mediated increases in activity (Nation et al.
1990). Further research is needed to clarify
these issues.
Implications for cadmium risk assess-
ments. Previous cadmium risk assessments
have considered renal effects to be the most
sensitive end point of cadmium toxicity, and
they identified urinary cadmium threshold
levels that should protect against renal damage
[EFSA 2009; World Health Organization/
Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (WHO/FAO) 2011]. Recent
risk assessments by the European Food Safety
Authority (EFSA 2009) and the WHO
(WHO/FAO 2011) yielded urinary cadmium
reference levels of 1 and 5.24 g cadmium/g
creatinine, respectively. When we excluded
from the analyses the four study participants
with urinary cadmium levels above the EFSA
reference level, the associations between uri-
nary cadmium and LD/special education were
still evident (comparing the highest and lowest
urinary cadmium quartiles: LD, OR = 3.25;
95% CI: 1.45, 7.28; special education, OR =
3.03; 95% CI: 1.14, 8.08). Thus, our work
demonstrates associations with LD/special
education at urinary cadmium levels below
both the WHO and EFSA reference levels.
If these associations are replicated in other
populations, then neurodevelopmental toxic-
ity may be a sensitive end point to consider in
future cadmium risk assessments. The EFSA
and WHO risk assessments used toxicokinetic
models to link creatinine-standardized urinary
cadmium levels to dietary cadmium intake
in order to estimate dietary intake standards
(Amzal et al. 2009; EFSA 2009; WHO/FAO
2011). These toxicokinetic models were vali-
dated in adults (Amzal et al. 2009), but they
are probably not appropriate to use among
children, because exposure routes may differ
(Weidenhamer et al. 2011) and because urinary
creatinine concentration varies markedly with
small increases in age among children (Barr
et al. 2005). Recent work by Weidenhamer
et al. (2011) suggests that mouthing or acci-
dentally swallowing objects such as inexpensive
jewelry may also contribute significantly to
cadmium exposure in childhood. The extent to
which these sources contributed to cadmium
exposure in our population is unknown, but
future risk assessments should not ignore the
potential impact of non-food-based exposures
or that current toxicokinetic models are not
child specific.
Strengths and limitations. Exposure. The
use of urinary cadmium as an exposure metric
is a strength of this study. Urinary cadmium
integrates exposure over many years (Lauwerys
et al. 1994); thus, if brain development is sen-
sitive to cadmium exposure in any of the time
periods represented by this exposure metric,
then this effect could be detected in our analy-
sis. However, it is not possible to determine
etiologically relevant time windows of exposure
or to confirm the temporal sequence of expo-
sure and outcomes based on the available data.
A shorter time-course exposure metric such
as blood cadmium (Lauwerys et al. 1994), in
the context of a longitudinal prospective study
that measures exposure and outcome at several
time points, may be able to determine if the
associations are driven by exposure that occurs
in specific developmental windows.
Outcomes. We believe the diversity of
outcomes evaluated is a strength of this study,
because the combination of these three out-
comes constitutes a screen for common neu-
rodevelopmental dysfunctions. One limitation
of these outcome measures is that they were
derived from parent or proxy-respondent
reports rather than neuropsychological evalua-
tions. The use of ADHD treatments as an out-
come would have likely identified only a subset
of ADHD cases, resulting in low case num-
bers and analyses of limited power (Froehlich
et al. 2007). Neuropsychiatric screening mea-
sures, such as the National Institute of Mental
Health Diagnostic Interview Scale for Children
that includes assessment of criteria for ADHD
based on the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (CDC-
NCHS 2006; Froehlich et al. 2009), would
have been more objective, but these outcomes
were not present in the publicly available
NHANES data. Although outcomes were
classified based on proxy-respondent reports,
it is unlikely that outcome misclassification
would be differential with respect to exposure
unless the accuracy of reporting was related to
unmeasured factors associated with cadmium
exposure. Typically, non
differential misclassi-
fication would be expected to bias associations
toward the null (Rothman et al. 2008).
Confounding. The extensive covariate data
available in NHANES, combined with the large
sample size and high number of cases, allowed
us to both evaluate and account for many
potentially confounding variables. We sought
to evaluate the association of cadmium exposure
with the outcomes after accounting for other
known correlates of the outcomes. We evalu-
ated three sets of models: a) models adjusted
only for creatinine, b) core models adjusted
for primary potential confounders, and c) full
models also adjusted for additional predictors
of a priori interest. The conclusions from all
three of these approaches were consistent. We
further note that adjusting for iron deficiency
using low hemoglobin had little effect on the
results and does not alter the conclusions of this
study (data not shown). As in any observational
epidemiology study, we cannot rule out the
possibility that confounding may have mean-
ingfully affected our results. Potential sources of
confounding in these analyses might include a
lack of detailed information on the home envi-
ronment (Bradley 1993) and parental psycho-
pathology (Bellinger 2001).
Study design. The cross-sectional design
of NHANES is a limitation of this study,
because the temporal relationships between
variables are not discernable. It is possible
that higher cadmium exposure puts children
at greater risk of LD/special education, but it
is also possible that children with LD/special
education have behaviors or prefer foods that
increase their cadmium exposure. However,
we are unaware of evidence supporting this
reverse causation explanation.
The NHANES study design does offer
strengths related to power and generaliz-
ability. To our knowledge, this is the largest
study to evaluate associations between urinary
cadmium and childhood learning/behavioral
phenotypes. Because NHANES was designed
to represent the non
institutionalized U.S.
population (CDC-NCHS 2010b), our find-
ings should be generalizable to U.S. children
6­15 years of age.
Conclusions
The results of this study are consistent with
a growing body of evidence suggesting that
elevated cadmium exposure may be associ-
ated with LD and special education. However,
given the cross-sectional design and the nature
of parent-reported outcomes, interpretations
should be cautious. Prospective epidemio-
logic investigations and behavioral toxicol-
ogy studies in animals could help to clarify if
these associations are causal and if there are
critical developmental windows for exposure.
Prospective studies that consider co-exposures
such as lead may also help reveal why the find-
ings for LD/special education and ADHD
differed. Given that the cadmium levels in this
study represent typical exposure levels in U.S.
children, our findings emphasize the need for
further research into the potential neuro
developmental effects of cadmium exposure.
