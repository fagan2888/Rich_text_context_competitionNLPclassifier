Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the extraction force generated at different extubation angles using a
manikin simulation and a randomized clinical trial.
Methods: Simulations were performed on a manikin to assess the force generated at extubation
angles of 0, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 relative to the ground. The trial compared extraction
force and changes in vital signs in patients undergoing general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation
followed by extubation at 60 or 90.
Results: The simulation study found that the extubation force was significantly lower at 45 and
60 than at all other extraction angles. In the trial, extubation at 60 resulted in significantly lower
extraction force and systolic blood pressure elevation (n ¼ 23) than extubation at 90 (n ¼ 23).
Conclusion: Findings in a manikin simulation were confirmed by those of a randomized clinical
trial, where extubation at 60 required less force than 90, and was accompanied by less SBP
elevation. Extubation at 60 is less invasive than extubation at 90.

Introduction
Emergence from anaesthesia is a critical
period for recovery of consciousness, neuro-
muscular conduction and airway protective
reflexes. Although various anaesthesia pro-
cedures exist, recovery is always challenging,
particularly at the moment of tracheal
extubation.1­3 From the perspective of
airway management, a failure to extubate
is associated with various conditions, such
as hypoxia, hypercapnia, vomiting, aspir-
ation, inadequate ventilatory drive and
laryngospasm. Such conditions may

progress rapidly, thereby leading to poten-
tially serious complications. In addition to
respiratory events, emergence from general
anaesthesia can occasionally result in
undesirable side-effects such as agitation,
abnormal hypertension or tachycardia, and
arrhythmia; such side-effects may cause
bleeding from the surgical wound site and
an increase in intracranial and intraocular
pressure.4­6 Noninvasive tracheal extuba-
tion with minimal force is therefore import-
ant for avoiding circulatory and airway
collapse.
The angle of extraction of the tracheal
tube may influence extubation force, but this
has only been evaluated in a single simula-
tion study.7 We hypothesized that extraction
force would be lower when the tracheal tube
is extracted at a smaller angle relative to the
ground than a vertical extubation at 90.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate
the extraction force generated by different
extubation angles using a manikin simula-
tion and randomized clinical trial.
Patients and methods
Manikin-based simulation
The Airway Management TrainerÕ manikin
(Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway), which is
designed to represent the adult male anat-
omy, was used for tracheal tube intubation
and extubation simulations. A tracheal tube
with 8.5 mm internal diameter (PortexÕ Soft
SealÕ, Smiths Medical, Ashford, UK) was
placed at the centre of the submandibular
area, 24 cm from the incisors.8 No lubricant
was used. Extraction force was assessed at
extubation angles of 0, 30, 45, 60, 90,
and 120 (relative to the ground) using a
force-measuring device (Digital Force
GaugeÕ, Shimpo Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)
tied tightly to the cuff of the tracheal tube.
Extubation angles were confirmed as shown
in Figure 1. The head of the manikin was
fixed in neutral position with cohesive tape.
The tracheal tube was removed 10 times at
each angle, with the same individual per-
forming all extubations (R.M.).
Randomized clinical trial
Study population. The study recruited patients
scheduled for general anaesthesia with tra-
cheal intubation at Osaka Medical College,
Takatsuki, Japan, between November 2014
and December 2014. Based on results
obtained from the simulation study, patients
were assigned at random via an envelope
method to undergo extubation at either 60
or 90 relative to the ground (Figure 2).
Exclusion criteria were: contraindications to
rapid induction (e.g., full stomach, gastro-
oesophageal reflux); anticipated difficulty
with airway (e.g., difficult head tilting or
mouth opening); ischaemic heart disease;
tooth instability.
This study was approved by the institu-
tional review board of Osaka Medical
College, Takatsuki, Japan (clinical trial
registry no. UMIN000015656), and written
informed consent was obtained from each
patient prior to enrolment.
Anaesthesia and intubation. No premedication
was used. Percutaneous oxygen saturation,
invasive blood pressure, heart rate, electro-
cardiography and end-tidal carbon dioxide
tension were monitored for each patient
using standard techniques. Anaesthesia
was induced with 1­2 mg/kg propofol
bolus or continuous target-controlled infu-
sion and 0.3­0.5 mg/kg per min remifentanil.
Rocuronium 0.8­1.0 mg per kg was used as
muscle relaxant. A size 3 or 4 laryngoscope
blade was used, according to the anaesthe-
tist's preference.
The size of the tracheal tube (Portex Soft
SealÕ) was determined by the staff anaes-
thetist using the formula: patient height/
20 mm. The number of intubation trials was
recorded and Cormack's classification
was assessed. The tip of the tracheal tube
was placed $2 cm into the trachea with the
654 Journal of International Medical Research 43(5)
indicator on the tracheal tube, then fixed at
the right side of the mouth using cohesive
tape. Anaesthesia was maintained by con-
tinuous administration of desflurane or
sevoflurane, remifentanil and rocuronium
(using standard procedures). The decision to
use epidural block, peripheral nerve block-
ade, continuous fentanyl administration or
intravenous acetaminophen for postopera-
tive analgesia was made by the anaesthetist.
Extubation. At the end of surgery, the con-
tinuous infusion of sedatives and analgesics
was stopped, and muscle relaxation was
reversed with a sufficient dose of sugamma-
dex, as recommended by the manufacturer
(Merck & Co., Kenilworth, NJ, USA).
While the patient was supine with the head
at a neutral position, the fixation tape was
removed, the tracheal tube was moved to the
centre of the submandibular area, and the

force-measuring device was tied tightly to
the cuff of the tracheal tube. Mechanical
ventilation continued until the patient
regained consciousness and breathed spon-
taneously (with care taken to not exceed
40 mmHg end-tidal carbon dioxide), at
which point the patient was instructed to
open his/her mouth widely and extubation
was performed. The extubation angle was
guided by the same indicator as used in the
simulation study (Figure 1c). Force meas-
urement was performed by two anaesthetists
each with >8 years' experience (R.M.,
N.K.). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), dia-
stolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate
were monitored before extubation (at tra-
cheal tube cuff deflation) and after extuba-
tion (maximum values during 60 s after
extubation). Postoperative hoarseness and
pharyngeal pain were assessed after extuba-
tion and arousal (by R.M. or N.K).
Statistical analyses
Sample size was calculated based on a
preliminary study of the force required to
extubate at 90 or 60 relative to the ground
in eight patients. The mean Æ SD force was
9.9 Æ 3.2 N at 90 and 5.4 Æ 2.5 N at 60.
With an a-error of 0.05 and b-error of 0.2, it
was determined that 20 patients per group
would be adequate. We aimed to recruit 23
patients per group to adjust for missing
data.
Data were presented as mean Æ SD or
median (interquartile range [IQR]). Kruskal
Wallis test followed by Scheffe's multiple
comparison was used to compare differences

in tracheal tube extraction force in the
simulation study. Patient demographic and
clinical characteristics were compared using
2-test and unpaired Mann­Whitney U-test.
2-test was used to assess postoperative
hoarseness and pharyngeal pain. Mann­
Whitney U-test was used to compare extu-
bation force and vital signs (blood pressure
and heart rate) in the randomized clinical
trial. Statistical analyses were performed
with JMPÕ 11 software (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC, USA). P-values < 0.05 were con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
Manikin-based simulation
Median extraction force was significantly
lower at 45 (7.5 Æ 0.5 N) and 60
(7.2 Æ 0.5 N) than at all other extubation
angles tested (P < 0.001 for each compari-
son; 0, 14.1 [0.7] N; 30, 10.5 [0.6] N; 60,
7.2 [0.5] N; 90, 8.5 [0.4] N; 120, 8.6 [0.4]
N;). There was no significant difference in
extraction force between 45 and 60. Based
on these findings, extubation angles of 60
and 90 were chosen for the randomized
clinical trial.
Randomized clinical trial
The CONSORT flowchart for patient
recruitment is shown in Figure 3. A total
of 60 patients were assessed for eligibility;
three refused and 11 were excluded. After
obtaining written informed consent, 46
patients were included in the study (23
male/23 female; mean age 63.5 Æ 13.2
years; age range 20­80 years). The final
analysis included 23 patients in each group.
There were no statistically significant
between-group differences in any demo-
graphic or clinical characteristic Table 1.
Extraction force was significantly lower
at 60 than 90 (4.8 [2.0]N and 9.4 [2.5]N,
respectively; P < 0.001).
Intra- and postoperative data are shown
in Table 2. There were no significant
between-group differences in pre- and post-
extubation SBP, DBP or heart rate. The SBP
pre/post-extubation ratio was significantly
higher in the 90 group than the 60 group

cant between-group differences in DBP or
heart rate pre/post-extubation ratios, or the
incidence of hoarseness or pharyngeal pain.
Discussion
Careful airway and circulatory management
during anaesthesia recovery is essential.9
The timing of extubation is particularly
important because its failure can be asso-
ciated with severe complications.10 Early
extubation is associated with laryngospasm
or airway obstruction by the tongue, and
respiratory suppression via the action of
analgesics and anaesthetics remaining in the
system. Conversely, delayed extubation is
associated with abnormal hypertension or
tachycardia associated with cardiac and
brain morbidity, and frequent bagging can
lead to pneumothorax and chronic obstruct-
ive pulmonary disease.11 Thus, smooth and
noninvasive extubation has long been a goal
for anaesthetists.12­15

Studies have reported gentle and smooth
extubation techniques that rely on the
administration of drugs or application of
local anaesthetics to the pharyngeal or tra-
cheal structure, or even into tracheal tube
cuffs.16,17 Although several simulation and
clinical studies have assessed extraction
force with various fixation methods
(aiming to avoid unintentional extuba-
tion),18,19 very little is known regarding
extraction force during recovery from anaes-
thesia. To our knowledge, ours is the first
clinical trial to evaluate extraction force by
extubation angle without fixation. The cur-
rent simulation study indicated that extuba-
tion at 45 or 60 relative to the ground
required significantly less force than other
angles. Based on these findings, we con-
ducted a randomized clinical trial to com-
pare extraction forces at 60 and 90.
Extubation at 60 required significantly less
force than at 90, consistent with data from
the simulation study. Moreover, changes in
SBP were larger when extubation was per-
formed at 90 compared with 60, suggesting
that extubation at 60 is less invasive for
patients than extubation at other angles.
This study has several limitations. First,
the use of a manikin simulation meant that
factors encountered in the clinical setting
(such as saliva and sputum in the orophar-
ynx) were not adequately reflected.20
Secondly, only one type of tracheal tube
was used. Several tracheal tubes with vari-
ous stiffness and shapes exist, and evaluating
differences based on the type of tube may be
warranted.21 Thirdly, although simulation
analysis showed that an extubation angle of
45 resulted in lower extraction force than
other angles (with the exception of 60), the
clinical evaluation was performed at 60 and
90 only. The 60 angle was selected because
the median extraction force was slightly
lower than at 45 in the simulation trial.
Randomized clinical trials including 45
angles may help to optimize noninvasive
extubation. Finally, the precision of the
force-measuring device used in this study
should be taken into consideration, as well
as measurement uncertainties resulting from
manual extubation. Further multicentre
studies or meta-analyses would help to
validate our findings.
In conclusion, data from the simulation
study indicate that extubation at 45 or 60
requires less force than extubation at 90.
This was confirmed by the randomized
clinical trial, where extubation at 60
required less force than 90, and was
accompanied by less SBP elevations.
Extubation at 60 is less invasive than
extubation at 90.
