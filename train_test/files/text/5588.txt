Introduction
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing in epidemic
proportions worldwide and is becoming a global health
challenge. It has been estimated that the global burden of
diabetes will further increase to more than 550 million by
2030.1 Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the most
common form of diabetic neuropathy associated with the
microvascular, long-term complications of T2DM. The
pathogenesis of DPN has not been understood completely.
There is a common view that DPN is a multifactorial dis-
ease caused by complex interactions between a variety of
genetic and environmental factors.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is an important
component of the renin­angiotensin system (RAS) that con-
verts angiotensin (Ang) I to Ang II. It has been suggested
that high levels ofAng II may play a key role in glucose and
insulin regulation, and may increase the risk of diabetes.2 In
addition, Shiuchi et al. showed that Ang II type-1 receptor
blockade increased insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in
skeletal muscle of diabetic mice.3 Furthermore,ACE inhibi-
tor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) may
decrease patients' odds of developing new-onset T2DM.4
Thus, high levels of ACE and Ang II might play an impor-
tant role in the pathogenesis of T2DM.
The ACE gene is localized on the band 17q23 of 17th
chromosome in human.5 Within intron 16 a polymorphism
exists, consisting of the presence or absence of a 287-bp
fragment.6 The ACE genotype is classified into three types:
II, DD, and ID. The serumACE levels of DD homozygotes
are approximately twice as high as those of II genotype
individuals.7 The serum ACE levels of ID type are inter-
mediate.7 Recently, Niu et al. found that the ACE D allele
was associated with an increased risk of T2DM.8 Wang
Angiotensin-converting enzyme I/D

A meta-analysis

Abstract
Background: Several molecular epidemiological studies have been conducted to examine the association between
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) I/D polymorphism and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) risk. However, the
conclusions remained controversial. We therefore performed this meta-analysis.
Methods: PubMed and EMBASE were searched to identify case-control studies investigating the associations of ACE I/D
polymorphism with risk of DPN. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength
of association between ACE I/D polymorphism and risk of DPN.
Results: A total of seven case-control studies including 1316 cases and 1617 controls were included. ACE I/D
polymorphism was associated with a significantly increased risk of DPN (OR=1.46, 95%CI 1.11­1.92, p=0.006, I2=48%).
This result remained statistically significant when the adjusted ORs were combined (OR=1.84, 95%CI 1.14­2.99, p=0.01,
I2=53%). In the subgroup of ethnicity, a significantly elevated risk was observed in Caucasians (OR=1.32, 95%CI 1.10­
1.59, p=0.003, I2=43%).
Conclusions: Our meta-analysis confirmed that ACE I/D polymorphism was associated with the risk of DPN.

and coworkers suggested that ACE I/D polymorphism
may contribute to diabetic nephropathy development.9 In
addition, Lu and colleagues showed that I/D polymor-
phism in the ACE gene was associated with diabetic
retinopathy.10
However, whether ACE I/D polymorphism is associ-
ated with DPN is still unclear. Li found that the ACE D
allele was significantly linked with essential hypertension
susceptibility.11 Forrest et al. suggested that hypertension
was an independent predictor of the incidence of DPN.12
These results indicated that ACE I/D polymorphism may
be involved in the development of DPN. Several studies
have investigated this issue to date.13-19 The results, how-
ever, were inconsistent and conflicting. This present meta-
analysis was performed to evaluate the association between
this polymorphism and DPN.
Materials and methods
Publication search
Online electronic databases (PubMed and EMBASE) were
searched using the search terms: (angiotensin-converting
enzyme or ACE) and (polymorphism or variant or varia-
tion) and (diabetes mellitus or neuropathy). Additional
studies were identified by a hand search from the refer-
ences of original studies or review articles on this topic.
There was no language restriction.
Study selection
The following inclusion criteria were used: (1) the study
should have evaluated the association between the ACE
I/D polymorphism and DPN risk; (2) the study should
have a case-control design; (3) sufficient data should have
been provided in order to calculate odds ratios (OR) and
95% confidence interval (CI), or the studies offered ORs
and 95% CIs. Studies were excluded if any of the follow-
ing conditions applied: (1) only abstracts or reviews were
available, without sufficient data; (2) animal studies; (3)
studies were repeated or publications overlapped.
Data extraction and qualitative assessment
The following data were recorded from each article: first
author, year of publication, ethnicity of participants, num-
bers of cases and controls, and genotype numbers in cases
and controls. The data were extracted by two authors inde-
pendently. Discrepancies between two authors were
resolved by discussion.
Two authors completed the quality assessment indepen-
dently. The Newcastle­Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to
evaluate the methodological quality, which scored studies
by the selection of the study groups, the comparability of the
groups, and the ascertainment of the outcome of interest. We
considered a study awarded 0­3, 4­6, or 7­9 as a low-,
moderate-, or high-quality study, respectively. Discrepancies
were resolved by consensus and discussion.
Statistical analysis
The strength of association between the ACE I/D poly-
morphism and DPN risk was assessed by calculating ORs
with 95% CI. The pooled ORs were performed for reces-
sive model since most of the studies reported the results in
this genetic model. Departure from Hardy­Weinberg
equilibrium (HWE) in controls was tested by the Chi-
square test. A statistical test for heterogeneity was per-
formed based on the Q statistic. The p>0.10 of the Q-test
indicated a lack of heterogeneity among studies. If hetero-
geneity was observed among the studies, the random-
effects model was used to estimate the pooled OR (the
DerSimonian and Laird method). Otherwise, the fixed-
effects model was adopted (the Mantel­Haenszel method).
Stratified analysis was performed by ethnicity. To explore
the source of the heterogeneity, Galbraith plots were used.
To access the stability of the meta-analysis, one-way sen-
sitivity analysis was conducted. Cumulative meta-analysis
was also performed. Because no more than 10 studies
were included in this meta-analysis, we did not assess the
publication bias. All statistical tests were performed with
the software STATA version 11.0 (Stata Corporation,
College station, TX, USA). A p value <0.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant.
Results
Eligible studies
A total of seven articles on ACE I/D polymorphism and
DPN risk met the study inclusion criteria, and were
included in the meta-analysis.13-19 In total, 1316 DPN cases
and 1617 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Six
case-control studies included Caucasian populations,
while only one study included an Asian population. Four
studies reported the adjusted ORs and 95% CIs. All studies
were assessed by NOS. The quality scores ranged from 6
to 9, suggesting that the methodological quality was
acceptable. Two studies did not provided the genotype
numbers of ACE I/D polymorphism among DPN cases and
controls. Other studies suggested that the distribution of
genotypes in the controls was consistent with HWE. The
characteristics of each case-control study and the genotype
in each study are presented in Tables 1 and 2.
Meta-analysis
The DD + DI genotype of ACE I/D polymorphism was
associated with a significantly increased risk of DPN
when compared with the II genotype (OR=1.46, 95%CI
Li and Tong 789
1.11­1.92, p=0.006, I2=48%; Figure 1). When stratified
by ethnicity, the significantly elevated risk was observed
in Caucasians (OR=1.32, 95%CI 1.10­1.59, p=0.003,
I2=43%). Four studies reported adjusted ORs. The com-
bination of adjusted ORs for DPN was 1.84 (95%CI
1.14­2.99, p=0.01, I2=53%).
As shown in Figure 2, significant associations were evi-
dent with each addition of more data over time. The results
showed that the pooled ORs tended to be stable. A single
study involved in the meta-analysis was deleted each time
to reflect the influence of the individual data set to the
pooled ORs, and the corresponding pooled ORs were not
materially altered (Figure 3).
The Galbraith plot was used to find the source of the
heterogeneity. As shown in Figure 4, two studies might be
the source of the heterogeneity. After excluding these stud-
ies, the between-study heterogeneity effectively decreased
and there was no obvious heterogeneity (I2=0%, p=0.70).
Besides, the result was still statistically significant
(OR=1.42; 95%CI, 1.14­1.76; p=0.002).
Discussion
This meta-analysis of seven case-control studies system-
atically evaluated the association between ACE I/D poly-
morphism and DPN risk. We found that ACE DD and DI
genotypes were significantly associated with DPN risk.
This result suggested that individuals with the DD or DI
genotype had an increased DPN risk. In the subgroup anal-
ysis, we found that Caucasians with the DD or DI geno-
type had an increased DPN risk. However, only one study
investigated the association between ACE I/D polymor-
phism and DPN risk in Asians. Thus, more studies are still
needed to determine the association between ACE I/D
polymorphism and DPN risk in Asians.
ACE catalyzes the generation of Ang II from Ang I as
well as the cleavage of bradykinin. Ang II is a powerful
circulating vasoconstrictor, which may contribute to vascu-
lar tone in nerve and muscle circulatory beds. It is clear that
nerve blood flow deficits make an important contribution to
the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy.20 ACEI has been
shown to protect against the loss of intraepidemal nerve
fibers in a T2DM rat model.21 In terms of clinical trials,
ACEI produced some modest improvements in DPN.22 In
addition, a lack of bradykinin receptors exacerbated dia-
betic complications, including DPN.23 These results sug-
gested that high levels of ACE may play a critical role in
the development of DPN. Since ACE I/D polymorphism
was associated with plasma levels of ACE, it was possible
that this polymorphism might influence DPN risk.
Heterogeneity is a potential problem that may affect the
interpretation of the results. We found that significant het-
erogeneity existed in this meta-analysis. A Galbraith plot
was used to find the sources of heterogeneity. We found
that I2 value was decreased after excluding two studies.
The result suggested that these two studies may be the

major source of the heterogeneity. Moreover, heterogene-
ity did not influence the results, because the significance
of the result was not altered after excluding the studies.
Results from one-way sensitivity analysis suggested the
stability of the result. In addition, the main result remained
statistically significant when the adjusted ORs were com-
bined. All together, these results suggest that the results of
this meta-analysis are reliable.

However, some limitations should be noted. First, sub-
group analyses were not performed by factors such as gen-
der and age because insufficient data could be extracted
from the primary articles. Second, there was only one
case-control study that investigated the association of ACE
I/D polymorphism with DPN risk in Asians. Therefore,
more studies with large sample sizes are needed to further
identify the association among Asians. Third, because of
the complex nature of DPN, it is unlikely that a polymor-
phism in one single gene would be obviously associated
with DPN risk. However, insufficient data could be
extracted from the primary studies. Therefore, we did not
perform the analysis of other polymorphisms in ACE and a
haplotype analysis.
In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggested that ACE
I/D polymorphism was associated with an increased DPN

confirm our findings.
