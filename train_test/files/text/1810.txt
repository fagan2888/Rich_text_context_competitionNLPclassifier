OBJECTIVE -- The objective of this study was to develop a simple tool for the U.S. popula-
tion to calculate the probability that an individual has either undiagnosed diabetes or pre-
diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We used data from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and two methods (logistic regression and
classification tree analysis) to build two models. We selected the classification tree model on the
basis of its equivalent accuracy but greater ease of use.
RESULTS -- The resulting tool, called the Diabetes Risk Calculator, includes questions on
age, waist circumference, gestational diabetes, height, race/ethnicity, hypertension, family his-
tory, and exercise. Each terminal node specifies an individual's probability of pre-diabetes or of
undiagnosed diabetes. Terminal nodes can also be used categorically to designate an individual
as having a high risk for 1) undiagnosed diabetes or pre-diabetes, 2) pre-diabetes, or 3) neither
undiagnosed diabetes or pre-diabetes. With these classifications, the sensitivity, specificity,
positive and negative predictive values, and receiver operating characteristic area for detecting
undiagnosed diabetes are 88%, 75%, 14%, 99.3%, and 0.85, respectively. For pre-diabetes or
undiagnosed diabetes, the results are 75%, 65%, 49%, 85%, and 0.75, respectively. We validated
the tool using v-fold cross-validation and performed an independent validation against NHANES
1999­2004 data.
CONCLUSIONS -- The Diabetes Risk Calculator is the only currently available noninvasive
screening tool designed and validated to detect both pre-diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes in
the U.S. population.

The objective of this study was to de-
velop a simple, self-administered,
paper-based screening tool that
could be used by the public to determine
their risk of having pre-diabetes or un-
diagnosed diabetes and to help people
decide whether they should see a phy-
sician for further evaluation. To maxi-
mize its accessibility and ease of use, the
tool should use only information that is
commonly known to an average individ-
ual and preferably should not require any
calculations.
The prevalence of diabetes is growing
rapidly, with the total number of cases
worldwide projected to increase from 171
million in 2000 to 366 million by 2030 (1).
In the U.S. in 2002, the prevalence of dia-
betes was estimated to be 19.3 million, of
which about 5.8 million cases were undiag-
nosed (2). An additional 41 million individ-
uals are estimated to have pre-diabetes,
defined as impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or
impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Pre-
diabetes implies an increased risk of devel-
opment of type 2 diabetes on the order of
30% over 4 years (3) and 70% over 30 years
(4). Several studies have demonstrated that
type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed
with lifestyle modification or the use of
pharmacotherapy in subjects with pre-
diabetes (3,5). Studies have also indicated
thatpreventingordelayingtheonsetoftype
2 diabetes by lifestyle modification or the
use of pharmacotherapy can be cost-
effective (6) if costs of the interventions are
controlled (4).
An important step in preventing or
delaying type 2 diabetes and its complica-
tions is to identify people with pre-
diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes so that
they can be given appropriate care. The
American Diabetes Association recom-
mends screening for type 2 diabetes at
3-year intervals beginning at age 45, par-
ticularly in those with BMI 25 kg/m2
(7). However these recommendations are
not widely followed, as indicated by the
fact that in 30% of people who have dia-
betes it is still undiagnosed. Major reasons
for this problem are the cost and inconve-
nience of testing.
One way to address this problem is to
develop a simple, inexpensive tool that
can identify people who are at high risk of
having pre-diabetes or undiagnosed dia-
betes and motivate them to be screened.
Several investigators have developed dia-
betes risk assessment tools. However,
most of those tools apply to non-U.S.
populations and none were designed to
detect pre-diabetes and undiagnosed dia-
betes. The objective of this study was to
develop a simple tool for use in the U.S. to
identify people who have a high proba-
bility of having pre-diabetes or undiag-
nosed diabetes, using only information
that is commonly known to an average
individual and preferably not requiring
any calculations.

(FPG) and glucose tolerance, as measured
by a 2-h plasma oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT). IFG is defined as FPG of 100­
125 mg/dl. IGT is defined as 2-h OGTT
result of 140­199 mg/dl. Diabetes is de-
fined as FPG 126 mg/dl and/or 2-h
OGTT result 200 mg/dl. Pre-diabetes is
defined as IFG and/or IGT without diabe-
tes. Undiagnosed diabetes is defined as
the presence of actual diabetes based on
FPG and/or a 2-h OGTT and the absence
of an individual having been told that he
or she has diabetes. We use the term "el-
evated plasma glucose" to define an indi-
vidual who has either pre-diabetes or
undiagnosed diabetes.
Data
We used data from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) (1988­1994) to build and in-
ternally validate the tool (8). This dataset
was chosen for two main reasons. First, it
is a representative sample of the U.S. pop-
ulation, which is the main population for
which the tool is being designed. The sur-
vey methods oversampled certain sub-
populations, such as race/ethnicity
minorities but provided weights to enable
construction of a representative sample of
the U.S. Second, the NHANES III dataset
is the most current NHANES survey that
contains 2-h OGTT results for a large sub-
sample of people, as well as FPG and the
pertinent characteristics and risk factors
needed to build a tool. Our analysis was
based on the results of the 7,092 partici-
pants who were aged 20 years and had
FPG results. Two-hour OGTT data were
available for approximately half of those
aged 40­75 years. For people for whom
2-h OGTT results were missing, the diag-
noses were based on FPG alone. An anal-
ysis of the group for whom both FPG and
OGTT data were available revealed that
the lack of OGTT data for some of the
participants did not materially affect the
stability of the results; the overall effect of
the missing data was to underestimate the
prevalences of pre-diabetes and undiag-
nosed diabetes by 2 and 1.5%, respec-
tively. Additional details about the data
collection and analysis are described in a
technical report available as an online ap-
pendix at http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/
dc07-1150.
Explanatory variables
To build the tool, we examined 18 ex-
planatory variables that would be known
to the average individual and would not
require laboratory results or special med-
ical definitions. These included BMI,
height, weight, waist circumference,
waist-to-hip ratio, age, sex, race/ethnicity,
taking blood pressure medication, taking
cholesterol medication, gestational diabe-
tes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
history of diabetes (any blood relative),
history of diabetes (parent or sibling), his-
tory of diabetes (parent), history of diabe-
tes (sibling), and exercise compared with
peers. Not all variables were used in the
final tool; their inclusion in the final mod-
els depended on their value as predic-
tors of pre-diabetes and undiagnosed
diabetes.
Strategy
To help ensure that we developed the best
possible tool from the available data, we
built two different tools using different
methods, compared them, and selected
the one that best served our objectives of
simplicity and accuracy.
Analytical methods
Logistic regression. One tool was devel-
oped using logistic regression, in which
the probability of pre-diabetes or undiag-
nosed diabetes was modeled by a logistic,
or log-odds, transformation

the response variable was assumed to
have a binomial distribution. The proba-
bility can be rewritten as

Logistic regressions were generated with
SAS (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary,
NC).
Classification and regression tree. We
also built a model using a classification
and regression tree method (CART)
(CART software version 5.0; Salford Sys-
tems, San Diego, CA). This technique sep-
arates data into mutually exclusive groups
that concentrate a particular class of the
target variable. In our analysis the target
variable could take a value of 0 or 1 de-
pending on whether undiagnosed diabe-
tes (or pre-diabetes) is absent or present,
respectively. The value of a target variable
is referred to as its class. Starting at the
tree root, the data are split into two
groups conditional on whether an explan-
atory variable or a linear combination of
explanatory variables is greater than some
value. The particular value of the explan-
atory variable selected for the split is the
one that best separates the target classes, 0
or 1, at the root node into two child
nodes. If the primary splitter variable field
is missing, a surrogate splitter variable is
used instead.
The process then repeats for each of
the child nodes. Subsequent splits can
involve another explanatory variable or
a different value of a previously used
variable. A node that is not further split
is referred to as a terminal node. Each
terminal node is assigned to a target
class conditional on whether the preva-
lence of the target class exceeds a desig-
nated threshold. The same threshold is
applied to all terminal nodes and deter-
mines overall sensitivity and specificity
of the tree. The classification tree is
grown to its maximum size and then
pruned on the basis of a criterion that
balances the number of terminal nodes
(complexity) against the accuracy of the
tree in classifying people, sometimes
termed misclassification cost.
To develop a single tree that could
be used to detect either pre-diabetes or
undiagnosed diabetes, we used an ap-
proach analogous to that used for the
regression model. Specifically, we first
developed a tree to predict undiagnosed
diabetes and then applied a different
threshold to predict pre-diabetes. Be-
cause one of the goals was to create a
simple model, BMI and waist-to-hip ra-
tio were dropped from the list of vari-
ables in favor of weight, height, and
waist circumference, which required no
calculation but still maintained the ac-
curacy of the tool. We eliminated the
cholesterol variables high cholesterol
and taking cholesterol medication be-
cause of the large number of missing
fields and low predictive value. We also
eliminated history of diabetes in any
blood relative in favor of the more spe-
cific diabetes history variables (history
of diabetes in a parent or sibling, in a
parent only, or in a sibling only).
We used v-fold cross-validation to
train and test the classification tree mod-
els, partitioning the data into equal-sized
subsets (9). We then derived and tested
the classification tree on all combinations
of 9 of 10 training data and 1 of 10 test
data.

RESULTS
Prevalence of pre-diabetes and
diabetes
The prevalences of undiagnosed diabetes
and pre-diabetes in the NHANES III data-
set were 4.16 and 26.14%, respectively.
Logistic regression model
Complete results for the logistic regres-
sion approaches are in found in the online
appendix. The best solution specified the
following coefficients for eqs. 1 and 2: in-
tercept, 21.6343; age at interview
(years), 0.0402; sex, 0.5042; weight
(kilograms), 0.029; height (centime-
ters), 0.0730; waist-to-hip ratio, 5.3827;
BMI (weight in kilograms divided by the
square of height in meters), 0.2947; told
has high blood pressure, 0­0.3449; and
parent has diabetes, 0.3981. Our strategy
for including two target conditions in a
single tool was to first choose the model
and threshold for detecting elevated
plasma glucose (either pre-diabetes or
diabetes) that had 80% sensitivity and
maximum specificity and then deter-
mine a second threshold for the same
model that achieved 80% sensitivity for
detecting undiagnosed diabetes. This
led to setting 0.254 as the threshold
probability for saying an individual has
elevated plasma glucose (either pre-
diabetes or undiagnosed diabetes) and
0.453 as the threshold for saying an in-
dividual has undiagnosed diabetes.
With use of these cut points, the sensitivity,
specificity, and area under receiver operat-
ing characteristic (ROC) for detecting ele-
vated plasma glucose were 80%, 64%, and
0.793, respectively. For detecting undiag-
nosed diabetes the values were 80%,
76.4%, and 0.86, respectively.
Validations were performed using
split datasets, in which the model was
"trained" on a randomly selected subset of
the data and tested on the remaining data.
Validation tests were repeated for differ-
ent selections of training and test data.
These tests all produced models that were
very similar to the original and performed
nearly as well on test data as on training
data.
CART
Detailed results of the CART method can
be found in the online appendix. The par-
ticular result that best met our objectives
is shown in Fig. 1, which is formatted as a
screening tool and called the Diabetes
Risk Calculator (DRC). It includes ques-
tions on age, waist circumference, gesta-
tional diabetes, height, race/ethnicity,
hypertension, family history, and exer-
cise. The tree begins in upper left corner.
An individual moves through the tree in
directions determined by answers to
questions at each branch, until ending in
a terminal node (oval). The probabilities
an individual at any terminal node has
undiagnosed diabetes or pre-diabetes are
shown in the nodes. If thresholds are set
for designating an individual as having el-
evated plasma glucose or pre-diabetes, it
is possible to calculate traditional mea-
Figure 1--Classification tree for detecting pre-diabetes (PDM) or undiagnosed diabetes (DM).

sures of accuracy and predictive value.
Thus, each terminal node can designate
an individual to be at high risk of either 1)
diabetes or pre-diabetes (if the probability
of undiagnosed diabetes is 8%) or 2)
pre-diabetes (if the risk of pre-diabetes is
29% and the risk of undiagnosed dia-
betes is 2.5%), or 3) neither diabetes or
pre-diabetes (if the risk of pre-diabetes is
29%andtheriskofundiagnoseddiabetes
is 1%). These three designations are rep-
resented by heavy, medium, and dashed
borders around the terminal nodes.
With use of these classifications, the
accuracy of the classification tree for un-
diagnosed diabetes is sensitivity 88%,
specificity 75%, positive predictive value
14%, negative predictive value 99.3%,
and area under the ROC curve 0.85. The
accuracy for pre-diabetes or undiagnosed
diabetes is sensitivity 75%, specificity
65%, positive predictive value 49%, neg-
ative predictive value 85%, and area un-
der the ROC curve 0.75. On the basis of
these results, a positive result on the DRC
for undiagnosed diabetes increases the
odds that an individual has undiagnosed
diabetes by a factor of 3.5, whereas a neg-
ative result decreases the odds by a factor
of 6, for an 18-fold difference in the odds
depending on the results of the test. For
increased plasma glucose, the difference
in the odds of a positive versus a negative
result is a factor of 6.
Validation of classification tree
The classification tree in Fig. 1 was vali-
dated in two ways. One was a split-sample
validation using data in NHANES III and
v-fold cross-validation methods. The
other was an external validation using in-
dependent data from NHANES 1999­
2004. The results are shown in Table 1.
The decreases in sensitivity and specificity
when applied to test data are typical, and
the model appears to be robust. Positive
predictive value indicates the fraction of
patients with a positive test having the
condition. The positive predictive value
for undiagnosed diabetes is much lower
for NHANES 1999 ­2004 than for
NHANES III data because the prevalence
of undiagnosed diabetes is lower in the
NHANES 1999­2004 dataset.
Comparison of logistic regression
model and classification tree
The classification tree performed slightly
better than the logistic regression model
for undiagnosed diabetes in the range of
greatest interest and was almost as accu-
rate for detecting elevated plasma glu-
cose. Because it is considerably simpler to
apply, requiring no calculations at all, we
selected it as the preferred tool for our
objectives.
CONCLUSIONS -- We have devel-
oped a simple tool that uses only ques-
tions known to an average individual and
requires no calculations to help identify
people who are at increased risk for pre-
diabetes or undiagnosed diabetes. The
DRC sorts people into 14 different cate-
gories and reports for each category the
probability that an individual is at low
risk or high risk for either undiagnosed
diabetes or pre-diabetes. To develop the
tool we applied two different methods:
logistic regression and CART. The ver-
sions produced by the two methods had
similar accuracies, predictive values, and
areas under ROC curves. We selected the
tool developed by the CART method be-
cause it could be translated into a simpler
tool, and it provided information about
the actual probabilities that an individual
has pre-diabetes or undiagnosed diabetes.
The tool developed by the CART method
is in the form of a tree that can be easily
navigated from the root to terminal nodes
through a series of branches, where the
path followed depends on the answers to
simple yes or no questions that any indi-
vidual would be able to answer. The final
terminal node determines the individual's
risk of undiagnosed diabetes and/or pre-
diabetes. The sensitivity of the DRC was
88 and 75% and the specificity was 75
and 65% for individuals with undiag-
nosed diabetes and pre-diabetes or undi-
agnosed diabetes, respectively.
To our knowledge, there are no other
tools designed to find people likely to
have pre-diabetes as defined by IFG or
IGT. Other tools have been developed for
detecting people with undiagnosed dia-
betes (10­17). The sensitivities for undi-
agnosed diabetes ranged from 72 to 86%,
with the highest sensitivity observed in
individuals who had one or more cardio-
vascular risk factors (18). The specificities
for the same tools ranged from 41 to 77%.
Other tools have been built to calculate
the risk of future development of diabetes
(10,18,19). One of the tools designed to
predict future drug-treated diabetes (10)
has been used in people with one or more
risk factors for cardiovascular disease to
try to identify those who have either un-
diagnosed diabetes or IGT (11). These
tools and applications were all designed
for different purposes than was the DRC.
Because one of the objectives of a
good screening tool is to minimize the
need for unnecessary testing and there-
fore reduce the economic impact of test-
ing, the predictive value is important to
consider for performance of the tool. The
positive predictive values of the DRC were
14 and 49% for diabetes and elevated
plasma glucose, respectively, and the neg-
ative predictive values were 99.3 and
85%, respectively. The positive predictive
value for the other screening tools for un-
diagnosed diabetes ranged from 8 to 13%
for non­high-risk populations and was
23% for individuals who have one or
more cardiovascular risk factors (11).
Thus, in terms of overall performance, the
DRC appears to compare favorably with

other available tools for detecting people
with undiagnosed diabetes, in addition to
its ability to detect people at high risk for
pre-diabetes.
Another important distinction of the
DRC is that it has been constructed for and
tested in a U.S. population. The NHANES
III dataset is a weighted survey and includes
individuals from different ethnicities as rep-
resented in the U.S. population. An analysis
showed that a risk score for undiagnosed
diabetes developed originally in a strictly
Caucasian population could not be applied
reliably to other populations with diverse
ethnic origins (12).
To our knowledge, the only other tool
for undiagnosed diabetes developed with
NHANES data was based on an older ver-
sion of the NHANES (NHANES II) (14).
For convenience we will call this the
"NHANES II model." When this model
was applied to the NHANES II data on
which it was developed, its reported sen-
sitivity of 79% and specificity of 65%
were lower than the sensitivity and spec-
ificity calculated for the DRC applied to
NHANES III data on which that model
was developed (88 and 75%, respec-
tively). Furthermore, when the NHANES
II model is applied to NHANES III data,
its sensitivity drops to 71.7% and its spec-
ificity decreases to 54.1% (see online
appendix).
Models generally perform best on the
data on which they were developed, and
they perform better on training data than
on test data. That the NHANES II model
does not perform as well on NHANES III
data as the DRC is not unexpected. How-
ever, the fact that the DRC performs better
than the NHANES II model, when each is
tested against the data used to develop it,
indicates a significant improvement in
predictability for the DRC.
Finally, the DRC has been validated
using two methods, 1) split sample cross-
validation methods applied to NHANES
III data and 2) application of the classifi-
cation tree to the NHANES 1999­2004
dataset. As expected, the sensitivity, spec-
ificity, and predictive values were some-
what lower in the validations than for the
training datasets. Nonetheless, the DRC
still appears to compare favorably to other
tools for detecting pre-diabetes and undi-
agnosed diabetes. Future research will in-
clude validating the tool using an
independent dataset from a diabetes pre-
vention clinical trial, as well as determin-
ing its applicability to populations outside
the U.S. Finally, development of a pa-
tient-friendly, electronic version is under-
way for broader use in clinical practice.
It is not possible to determine pre-
cisely the clinical value of any risk-
calculating tool or any diagnostic test for
that matter. Their purpose is to provide
information that would tip the balance
that an individual would choose to un-
dergo more definitive screening with
appropriate laboratory tests. For pre-
diabetes, it is well documented that treat-
ment can postpone and in some cases
prevent the onset of diabetes. It is also
well established that treatment of diabetes
helps prevent complications. For these
reasons, several organizations, such as the
American Diabetes Association, recom-
mend screening. Yet a high proportion of
people do not receive the recommended
screening tests. It is reasonable to assume
that some people do not perceive their
risk of pre-diabetes or diabetes to be suf-
ficiently high to justify the inconvenience
and cost. The DRC we describe in this
article is intended to give them a simple
method for determining whether they
might have a higher risk than they per-
ceive. For undiagnosed diabetes, a posi-
tive versus a negative result spreads the
odds of having that condition by a factor
of 18. For increased plasma glucose, the
spread in odds of that condition is by a
factor of 6. It seems reasonable to believe
that for many people this information
may aid in their decision to seek care.
In summary, we have described a
simple, validated, paper-based screening
tool that can be used to calculate the prob-
ability that an individual has either undi-
agnosed diabetes or pre-diabetes using
information known to an average individ-
ual, without requiring any calculations.
The screening tool can be used by physi-
cians to assess the risks of their patients or
can be self-administered by individuals to
assess their own risks. Use of this tool en-
ables the identification of individuals who
might benefit from confirmatory tests and
treatment to delay or prevent the onset of
type 2 diabetes and its complications.
