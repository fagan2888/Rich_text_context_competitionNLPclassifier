Psychologists have studied the devaluation of women in the
workplace for more than 40 years. Early research in this area
centered on how written work produced by women was val-
ued less than the same work produced by men (e.g., Goldberg,
1968; Paludi & Strayer, 1985) and on the devaluation of
highly competent women (Lott, 1985). Studies published in
the 1970s and 1980s also showed that male job applicants
were more likely to be positively evaluated than female can-
didates (Bronstein, Black, Pfennig, &White, 1986; Heneman,
1977; Zikmund, Hitt, & Pickens, 1978) and that gender ste-
reotypes affected the evaluation of male and female supervi-
sors (Rosen & Jerdee, 1973).
Public opinions regarding work and gender have become
more egalitarian since the 1980s, but perceptions of work are
not yet gender neutral. For example, Elsesser and Lever
(2011) reported on results from a survey study of 60,470 on
gendered perceptions of managers. Results indicated that
although 54% reported no preference with respect to the gen-
der of their boss, of those who expressed a preference,
approximately 67% were in favor of male supervisors. Thus,
the majority explicitly reported no bias with respect to the
gender of a manager, yet approximately 31% of the sample
still preferred to work for a male.
In addition to looking at the perceived value of work, com-
petence of candidates, or supervisory preferences, an exami-
nation of salaries has been used to study the perceived worth
of women's work compared with men's. The long-standing
gender gap in pay in the United States indicates the higher
status accorded men's work (Gibelman, 2003). Across educa-
tional levels and occupations in the United States, women earn
less than men (U.S. Census, 2011). For example, aggregated
across occupation, education, and race, the mean full-time,
year-round income for males 25 years of age or older in 2011
was US$67,398, and the comparable mean for women was
US$48,404 or 28% less. Among adults with a bachelor's
degree or higher, the mean full-time, year-round income for
males was US$96,265 in 2011, and the comparable mean for
women was US$66,585 or 31% less.
The data 20 years ago conveyed a similar, but more
extreme, story: The mean full-time, year-round income for
males 25 years of age and above was US$35,850 in 1991 and
US$23,778 for females, 34% less. For those with a bache-
lor's degree or higher in 1991, the mean for males was
US$50,747 and for females US$33,144, 35% less. (U.S.
Census, 2011) There are, of course, various reasons for the
gender differential, including factors such as work history.
However, in 1984, Shepela and Viviano wrote that at least
part of such a salary differential is due to a sexist perception
of differences in competence when men's and women's work
is judged. "Women are paid less because they are in women's
jobs, and women's jobs are paid less because they are done
by women" (Shepela & Viviano, 1984, p. 47). Thus, they
argued that women's labor is not valued less because of the
nature of the work itself; it is valued less precisely because
women are doing it.

Gender and Perceptions of Occupational
Prestige: Changes Over 20 Years
Donna Crawley1
Abstract
Two studies compared perceptions of status for occupations based on the gender and race of the workers. In total, 387
college students participated in this research. Across studies, results indicated that participants did not differentially value
occupations based on the gender or race of the workers in terms of prestige ratings or salary estimates. However, participants
judged that occupations required more education when described as having predominantly male workers rather than female
workers. In addition, the participants showed different levels of interest in the positions depending on the occupational
gender. These results are compared with similar studies conducted 20 years ago, in which participants showed more overt
forms of devaluing occupations associated with women.

Consistent with this argument, Lips (2013) has presented
compelling analyses indicating that the human capital model
of occupational status is inadequate to completely explain
the gender pay gap. Examinations of investments in work,
defined by variables such as work history, education, years
of experience, and various occupational behaviors, are insuf-
ficient in explaining the salary gaps by gender. Furthermore,
many of these variables are influenced by gendered social
norms and pressures. Social stereotypes, overt gender dis-
crimination, the gendered nature of the workplace, and the
gendered nature of networks are all factors that contribute to
a continuing gender difference in occupational achievement
(Lips, 2013; Tharenou, 2013). Added to that are implicit ste-
reotypes about women and men that play a role in how male
and female work is perceived (cf. Williams, Paluck, &
Spencer-Rodgers, 2010).
While narrower than 20 years ago, the pay gap and thus
some status gap still exist today. When taken together, the
research related to women in the workplace presents a pic-
ture of social progress for women, albeit without equality.
England (2010, 2011) and Cohen, Huffman, and Knauer
(2009) presented evidence that although there is greater gen-
der equality in socioeconomic and occupational status, there
has also been a slowing down, if not a stall, in the progress of
women in achieving socioeconomic parity with men.
If it is true that occupations associated with women are
perceived as lower in status precisely because the workers
are women, then several expectations would be logical. First,
gender neutral occupations, those without pre-existing gen-
der stereotypes, should be perceived as having less social
status if the workers are predominantly female. Furthermore,
traditionally male occupations should become less "valu-
able" when women enter the field in large numbers. Finally,
men should show low interest in entering traditionally female
occupations, but women should show an interest in crossing
occupational gender boundaries.
Interestingly, this appears to have occurred in the field of
psychology. Fewer than 30% of PhD degrees in psychology
were earned by men in 2008 (Willyard, 2011) compared with
75% in 1971 (Pion et al., 1996). Within professional psy-
chology, women earn less than their male colleagues,
approximately 9% less in 2007 (Cynkar, 2007), and accord-
ing to a 2009 study of doctoral-level salaries in psychology
by years in the field, men earned more at every level of expe-
rience. However, the difference was most notable for those
who had worked in the field for 20 years or more. In that
cohort, women earned an average of 18% less than their male
counterparts. The gender differential for those with fewer
than 5 years of experience was smaller, with women earning
an average of 6% less than men (Center for Workforce
Studies, 2010).
Over the years, this salary difference has elicited concerns
about the "feminization of psychology" as more women have
entered the field (Cynkar, 2007; Ostertag & McNamara,
1991; Pion et al., 1996). Given that the feminization of a field
often seems to be related to a loss in prestige for that field and
an accompanying lowering of salaries, the possible "decline
of the field" of psychology was discussed 21 years ago at
the 1991 American Psychological Association (APA) confer-
ence in San Francisco and was addressed by a 1995 APATask
Force (Cynkar, 2007). According to Dorothy Cantor, chair of
that Task Force, as salaries in psychology declined in the
1980s due to a variety of economic factors, men left the field
and women filled in the gaps (Cynkar, 2007). Thus, lowered
salaries led to men leaving the field and opened the door to
women, and in turn as women entered the field, the status and
salaries were lowered further. (For analyses of the gender gap
in pay within other academic fields, see Travis, Gross, &
Johnson, 2009 and West & Curtis, 2006.)
There have been varied experimental findings in psychol-
ogy about differences in occupational prestige as a function
of the gender of the workers. For example, in 1974 Touhey
(1974) demonstrated that traditionally masculine occupa-
tions (lawyer, professor, scientist, architect, and physician)
tended to decrease in perceived prestige when it was expected
that women would be entering that profession in greater
numbers. Similarly, Liben, Bigler, and Krogh (2001) found
that children rated a novel job presented with male workers
as more prestigious than the same job when presented with
female workers. Vervecken, Hannover, and Wolter (2013)
demonstrated that children's perceptions of occupations, and
their interest in the occupations, are impacted significantly
by the forms of gendered language used to describe the occu-
pation. When an occupation is described only in masculine
terms, girls are less likely to express interest, and both girls
and boys expect less success by women in the field.
In the early 1990s, my students and I conducted two stud-
ies investigating perceptions of salary worth, along with rat-
ings of prestige, for an occupation based on the gender of the
majority of workers (Crawley & Poran, 1992). In one study,
college student participants read an occupational description
for public relations, which had been pretested and rated as
gender neutral (M = 5.30 on a 10-point scale with 1 as femi-
nine and 10 as masculine, n = 20) and moderate in prestige
(M = 5.05 on a 10-point scale with 10 as highly prestigious).
The description was constant across conditions except for a
statement about the gender of the majority of workers. Each
of the participants was randomly assigned to read one of the
job descriptions, and then rate on 10-point scales how presti-
gious the occupation appeared to be and how much respect
he or she had for the occupation. Finally, the participant indi-
cated what salary a worker who had been in the field for
7 years was worth. Although there were no significant effects
of worker gender on ratings of occupational prestige or
respect per se, the occupation was judged as worth US$5,880
per year more in salary when the workers were men
(M = US$49,880), than women (M = US$44,000), a signifi-
cant effect, F(1, 80) = 3.96, p = .05.
Asecond study with the same design used the occupation of
mental health casework. We created this job description to be
Crawley 3
ambiguous in terms of the educational level and status of the
workers, although we did not pretest the description. Again,
there were no significant effects of worker gender on ratings of
prestige or respect, but the occupation was judged to be worth
US$5,230 more in yearly salary when the workers were pri-
marily men (M = US$47,690) than women (M = US$42,460),
F(1, 105) = 3.86, p = .05. Thus, 20 years ago, these college
students seemed to believe that identical work was worth less,
and should be paid less, when women did the work.
One possible critique of using estimated salary levels as a
dependent measure in this type of research, however, is that
participants may simply be aware of gender gaps in wages,
and may reflect reality when they give different salary esti-
mates for occupations (Furnham & Wilson, 2011). However,
Williams et al. (2010) investigated the expectation that men
will make more money than women, and argued that when
participants allot a higher salary to men, the difference is not
solely a reflection of actual differences in salary within soci-
ety. They found significant differences in salary estimations
for male and female targets, and their results indicated that at
least part of the differential estimations was due to an implicit
stereotype that links males and wealth.
Gendered Interest in Occupations
Another measure of perceptions of gendered work has been
career interest in occupations. Across time periods, research
has shown that males and females, adolescent and adult,
express more interest in gender-congruent occupations than
in crossing gender boundaries (Church, Teresa, Rosebrook,
& Szendre, 1992; DiDonato & Strough, 2013; Ellis,
Ratnasingam, & Wheeler, 2012). Furthermore, in the views
of both men and women, it is more acceptable for women to
cross gendered occupational boundaries than men (DiDonato
& Strough, 2013; Jiang, Wang, & Wang, 2010). This pattern
of expressed interest is more pronounced among individuals
who endorse traditional gender values for themselves; self-
identified gender "atypical" males and females are more
likely to cross boundaries (Ellis et al., 2012; Patterson, 2012).
Although societal gender roles in the workplace have become
less rigid over time, gendered expectations persist and differ-
ences in occupational interest by gender are not likely to
change in the near future (Rudman & Phelan, 2010).
Race and Occupational Status
Occupational prestige is, of course, affected by demographic
variables other than gender. The literature on race and personal
occupational status is vastly complex, with a multitude of fac-
tors influencing occupational segregation, work status, and pay
differentials (Alonso-Villar, Del Rio, & Gradin, 2012;
McDonald, Lin, & Ao, 2009). Gender, immigration status, lan-
guage proficiency, cultural assimilation are but a few factors
that interact with race in affecting individuals' socioeconomic
status and the prestige of racially segregated occupations. For
example, across occupations, significant differences in socio-
economic status exist by gender and race and the interaction of
the two, moderated by educational attainment in the United
States (Lemelle, 2002). In his analysis of occupational status
for Black, White, and Hispanic men and women, Lemelle
(2002) found that economic status was higher for Whites than
for Blacks or Hispanics among people without college educa-
tions, but the pattern was modified for those who had attended
college. Also, although the socioeconomic index that Lemelle
used was generally higher for males than for females among
Whites, the reverse was true for Blacks and Hispanics, across
educational levels. In addition, Kim and Tamborini (2006)
found different patterns of racial discrimination depending on
the labor market under scrutiny. Race was less of a predictor of
occupational status within technical fields, although still pre-
dictive for occupations based on social skills.
Clearly, data indicate that some racial minority groups,
across educational levels and occupations, have lower socio-
economic status than Whites in the United States, but the rela-
tionship between race and occupational status is moderated by
many variables, including gender, education, and type of occu-
pation. Research has also found that while there are stereotypes
about the types of work-related abilities that various racial
groups have, and overall levels of expected competence
(Biernat & Kobrynowicz, 1997; Sy et al., 2010), these stereo-
types differ by gender as well. Therefore, once again, the rela-
tionship between racial characteristics and occupational
prestige is complex. While jobs with a high proportion of some
minority groups may be judged as having lower status and have
lower salaries, based on past research, it is not clear whether
"race neutral" jobs would be judged as lower in status if
described as predominantly occupied by a given racial minority
group than if described as predominantly White. Certainly,
gender and the nature of the occupation should interact with
race in affecting perceptions of occupational prestige.
Hypotheses
The current studies were designed to replicate our research
on gender and occupational status now that 20 years have
passed, using the same type of methodology, with students at
the same college. How much of a difference has 20 years
made in college student attitudes? Do students still perceive
that occupations are worth less when women constitute the
majority of the workers? The research design also includes
occupational race as a variable to investigate the impact of
the race of workers on perceptions of occupations, either as
main effects or in interaction with gender.
Based on the past research on gender, race, and occupa-
tional status, along with evidence of changing gender norms
and the narrowing of the gender pay gap, it is expected that
differences in perceptions of occupations by occupational gen-
der will not appear on overt measures of status, such as pres-
tige ratings. However, occupational gender is expected to
affect salary estimates, beliefs about educational requirements,
4 SAGE Open
and interest in the occupation. Also, occupational race should
interact with occupational gender in affecting perceptions of
occupational prestige.
Hypothesis 1 (H1): There will be a significant main effect
for occupational gender on estimates of starting salaries.
Participants will give higher estimates of starting salary
when the occupation is described as male-dominated.
Hypothesis 2 (H2): There will be a significant main
effect for occupational gender on estimates of educational
requirements. Participants will estimate that the occupa-
tion requires a higher educational achievement when the
occupation is described as male-dominated.
Hypothesis 3 (H3): There will be a significant interaction
between occupational gender and participant gender on
interest in the occupation. Male participants will prefer
gender-congruent occupations, while female participants
will be less affected by occupational gender.
Hypothesis 4 (H4): There will be a significant interaction
between occupational race and occupational gender for
salary estimates. Salary estimates will be higher for White
male occupations than White female conditions, but that
pattern will not be true for other racial groups.
Hypothesis 5 (H5): There will be a significant interaction
between occupational race and occupational gender for
estimates of educational requirements. Higher educa-
tional requirement will be estimated for White male occu-
pations than White female occupations, but that will not
be true for other racial groups.
Study 1
Method
Participants. A sample of 267 college students, 63 males and
183 females (with 21 not responding regarding gender), 87%
of whom identified themselves as White participated in this
research. These students attended a public liberal arts college
in the northeastern United States, the same college at which
the comparable research was done 20 years ago (Crawley &
Poran, 1992). The majority of incoming students at this col-
lege (56.6%) identify themselves as "middle of the road"
politically, with 25.3 identifying as liberal and 18.1% con-
servative (Institutional Research, 2012). Education and intel-
ligence have been found to be negatively correlated with
acceptance of traditional gender roles (Judge & Livingston,
2008). Thus, this college sample is likely to endorse rela-
tively liberal views regarding gender.
Materials and procedure.We created a questionnaire that
included a job description for an Abstract Checker, a position
in the insurance industry. We used the occupation of Abstract
Checker, a real--but little known--job title because it was
not commonly recognized, and had no immediate gender ste-
reotype when tested on a separate college sample (M = 5.30
on a 10-point scale from Very Feminine to Very Masculine,
n = 30). With respect to occupational race, the majority of the
test sample indicated that they expected the job to either have
the same ratio of African Americans, Latinos, Asians, and
Whites as in the general population (46.67%) or more Whites
(40.00%). The job description also tested as moderate in
prestige (M = 4.77 on a 10-point scale).
The description included job responsibilities along with
some information on the demographics of the people work-
ing in the field. A manipulation check was done on a college
sample of 20 to test comprehension and memory for the
demographic information. Results indicated that 90% of par-
ticipants correctly recalled the dominant racial group, and
75% reported the gender correctly. See Appendix A for a
copy of the job description.
After reading the job description, participants indicated
their perceptions of occupational worth by completing a
series of dependent measures. Respondents gave estimates of
the education needed to work in the field by checking off one
of seven choices ranging from "No Educational Requirement"
to "Post-Doctoral Work." Participants also estimated the
probable starting salary by naming a figure between
US$18,000 and US$90,000, rated their possible interest in the
field on a 10-point scale, from "No Interest At All" to "Very
HighDegreeofInterest,"andcompleteda22-itemPerceptions
of Occupational Status Survey (POSS). This survey measures
overall occupational status as a single dimension and has
been shown to have both convergent validity and internal reli-
ability. Overall scores on the POSS significantly differenti-
ated between occupations that have been ranked differently in
other research (Goyder, 2005), such as "cashier" and "veteri-
narian." Cronbach's alpha for the scale ranged from .80 to .92
across five samples and three different occupations (Crawley
& Cardinale, 2008; see Appendix B for a copy of the POSS.)
The demographic information on the fictitious job
description was manipulated to create six versions in a 2
(gender of the majority of workers) × 3 (race of the majority
of workers) design. Although the main focus of the research
was on gender, we examined the impact of three racial group-
ings on the descriptions as well: African American and
Latino; White; and Asian. We solicited participants from
undergraduate classes and via a subject pool at the college.
Each participant was randomly assigned to read one version
of the questionnaire and completed the form individually. At
the top of the questionnaire, a consent statement appeared,
and after completing the survey, each participant was fully
debriefed. The surveys took approximately 5 to 10 min to
complete; all data were kept completely anonymous.
Results
ANOVA and chi-squared analyses were done on completed
surveys. Due to missing data on some items, the sample size
for each analysis was slightly different. Results indicated
that there were no effects of occupational gender or race on
Crawley 5
overall prestige as measured by mean scores on the POSS
( = .92): F(1, 212) = 1.51, p = .22 for gender; F(2, 212) =
1.90, p = .15 for race; F(2, 212) = 0.61, p = .55 for the inter-
action. Similarly, there were no significant effects of occupa-
tional gender or race on salary estimates, F(1, 247) = 0.10,
p = .75 for gender, F(2, 247) = 0.18, p = .83 for race,
F(2, 247) = 1.02, p = .36 for the interaction. The mean start-
ing salary estimate for Abstract Checker when the workers
were predominantly males was US$40,260, and the mean for
the predominantly female version was US$39, 236. See
Table 1 for data on salary and POSS scores and the correla-
tions between the dependent measures.
There were no main effects of occupational gender or race
on estimates of required level of education; however, the pat-
tern of results by occupational gender was different for the
White worker condition than for the other occupational race
conditions. The responses regarding educational level were
analyzed as nominal data. Responses regarding educational
level were put into two categories for analysis--Less than a
Bachelor's Degree or Bachelor's Degree and Above. As
shown in Figure 1, for the White occupational gender condi-
tion, participants more frequently chose Bachelor's Degree
or a higher degree when the workers were predominantly
male than when they were mostly female, 2(1, N = 110) =
4.26, p = .04, C = .19. Of the 64 participants in the male
occupational gender condition, 39 (61%) estimated that at
least a Bachelor's Degree was required. For the female occu-
pational gender condition, 18 of 46 (39%) made a similar
judgment. There were no significant differences by occupa-
tional gender when the workers were described as predomi-
nantly African American and Latino or Asian.
Finally, there were no significant patterns related to inter-
est in the occupation by occupational gender or participant
gender, nor did participant gender affect any of the other
dependent variables.
Conclusion. These results indicate that there were no differences
in perceptions of prestige based on occupational gender or race.
Similarly, there were no effects of occupational gender or race
on salary ratings, in contrast to the findings on gender reported
in 1992; neither H1 nor H4 were supported in this sample. How-
ever, the degree of education thought to be required for this
occupation was directly affected by the gender of the workers
when the workers were described as White. No significant pat-
terns for educational requirement by gender appeared for the
other racial conditions for this occupation. Thus, there was an
interactive effect between occupational gender and race with
respect to educational estimates, supporting H5.
In an attempt to replicate these findings with another
occupation, we conducted Study 2. In this case, we created a
job title (Point of Sales Systems Coordinator) and a job
description in the retail sales industry that do not actually
exist. This occupation was created to be ambiguous in status
and gender neutral, as verified during pretesting. The overall
design for this replication was also simplified into a 2 × 2
design; we reduced the number of worker racial groups to
two--White or African American and Latino.
Study 2
Method
Participants. A sample of 120 college students participated. The
sample included 30 males and 79 females, with 11 respondents
not indicating gender; 63% identified themselves as White.

Materials and procedure. Each participant read one of four ver-
sions of a job description for a Point of Sales Systems Coordi-
nator, an occupation fabricated for this 2 × 2 design. The basic
occupational job description was rated as gender neutral
(M = 4.90 on a 10-point scale, n = 30) and below the midpoint
in prestige (M = 3.67 on a 10-point scale). The majority of the
test sample (56.67%) expected the same racial mix as in the
general population, although 26.67% expected more White
workers and 13.33% expected more Latinos. Each version of
the description had the same duties listed, but was manipu-
lated in terms of the percentage of women and men who
worked in the field, and in terms of the dominant racial group
working in the field. The occupation was described as having
workers who were predominantly male or female, and pre-
dominantly White, or African American and Latino.
After reading the job description, participants completed
a series of dependent measures, including estimations of the
education needed to work in the field by checking off one of
seven educational categories, as in Study 1. Participants also
estimated starting salary in an open-ended item and com-
pleted the POSS. Finally, respondents rated their possible
interest in the field.
Results
Ten participants did not complete the POSS, thus the sample
size for the prestige analysis was 110. These 10 participants
were among the 11 not indicating gender. Similar to the
results of Study 1, data analyses performed on completed sur-
vey items indicated no main effects of occupational gender or
race on the occupational prestige (POSS) scores ( = .91),
F(1, 106) = 0.24, p = .63 for gender and F(1, 106) = 1.67,
p = .20 for race. With respect to salary estimates, data from
three participants were discarded as their salary estimates on
this open-ended item were more than three standard devia-
tions above the mean, and thus were considered outliers; one
other respondent did not respond to the item. Based on the
remaining sample of 116, there were no main effects for occu-
pational gender, F(1, 112) = .22, p = .64, or for occupational
race, F(1, 112) = 1.16, p = .28. The mean salary estimated for
the predominantly male occupation was US$37,166, whereas
the mean for the female worker condition was US$34,707.
There were no significant interactions for the prestige scores,
F(1, 106) = 2.65, p = .11, or for salary, F(1, 112) = 3.12,
p = .08. See Table 2 for data on salary and POSS scores and
the correlations between the dependent measures.
The estimated level of education required for the occupa-
tion, however, was significantly affected by occupational
gender. Educational estimate was analyzed as a nominal
variable, condensing the responses into two categories--
Less than a Bachelor's Degree or Bachelor's Degree and
Above. Chi-squared analyses indicated that participants were
more likely to indicate that at least a Bachelor's Degree was
needed if the occupation was done primarily by male than by
female workers, 2(1, N = 120) = 5.69, p = .02, C = .20,
regardless of occupational race, as illustrated in Figure 2. Of
the 60 participants in the male occupational gender condi-
tion, 34 (57%) estimated that at least a Bachelor's Degree
was required. For the female occupational gender condition,
20 of 60 (33%) made a similar judgment.
Finally, there was no overall difference in interest in the
occupation based on occupational gender F(1, 105) = 0.36,
p = .55, but there was a significant difference between male
and female participants in interest, F(1, 105) = 8.01,
p = .006, 2 = .07, with males indicating greater interest
(M = 4.63 for male participants and M = 3.37 for females).

There was also a significant interaction between occupational
gender and participant gender, F(1, 105) = 6.21, p = .01, 2 =
.05. Female participants were mildly interested in the occupa-
tion, regardless of worker gender (M = 3.05 with male workers
and M = 3.64 with female workers), whereas male participants
were significantly more interested in the occupation if most of
the workers were male (M = 5.19 with male workers and M =
3.33 with female workers), as shown in Figure 3.
Conclusion
Participants did not report different perceptions of prestige or
salary for the fictitious occupation of Point of Sales System
Coordinator based on the gender or race of the workers.
Similar to Study 1, there was no overt sexism or racism
exhibited in how the occupation's prestige was rated, nor
were there differences in salary estimates. Once again, H1
and H4 were not supported. However, as with Study 1, a
subtle effect was found in that the participants perceived that
the occupation required a higher educational level when it
was a male-dominated field, in this case regardless of the
racial composition of the workers, as predicted in H2. In
addition, male and female participants showed a different
level of interest in the occupation depending on the gender
congruence of workers in support of H3.
Discussion
There are several consistent findings across the two studies
described above. First, it appears that there was no overt dis-
crimination in terms of ratings of prestige or difference in
salary estimates based on the race or gender of the workers in
any of the occupations. Although differences regarding sal-
ary were found with nearly identical methodologies at the
same college in the early 1990s, such differences among
college students were not apparent in this cohort; see Table 3
for the comparisons across time and occupations. The only
consistent area in which participants exhibited different per-
ceptions of an occupation based on gender was in judgments
of the educational requirements.
When a field was described as predominantly done by
men, most notably White men, respondents assumed that a
higher level of education was needed to be hired. Interestingly,
it is not the case that participants simply reflected the existing
demographic differences in educational achievement in their
estimates. The participants were from a state college, and
their estimates do not match the actual statistical data on edu-
cational achievements by race and gender for the state. Nor
do the estimates reflect the gender ratios at the college in
which these studies were conducted. Participants did not look
at the students around them at the college, see which gender
was more likely to be earning a bachelor's or master's degree,
and make estimates about educational hiring requirements
accordingly. In fact, the majority of students (57.4%) earning
bachelor's and master's degrees at the college are female
(Ramapo College, 2012). Thus, the inclination to perceive
that a "male" occupation probably requires more education
than a "female" occupation appears to be based on a stereo-
type associating education with men in general.
In addition, in Study 2, male participants showed different
interest in the occupation depending on the gender of
the workers. Although female participants did not differenti-
ate very much based on worker gender, male participants
were more likely to be interested in male-dominated fields
than in female-dominated occupations. This is consistent
with past research findings and with the idea that there is
more social stigma to men being interested in "feminine"
occupations, and less stigma to women expressing interest in
fields more typically associated with men (cf. Miller &
Hayward, 2006; Rudman & Phelan, 2010).
The finding that interest in occupations is still influenced
by the gendered nature of the job, while overt ratings of
occupational prestige and salary are not is also consistent
with research on implicit versus explicit measures of atti-
tudes. Many researchers have demonstrated subtle reactions,

Sales Systems Coordinator on a 10-point scale.
Note. There was a significant interaction between occupational gender and
participant gender on interest (p = .01).

due to automatic processes and implicit biases, in cases
where overt, consciously discriminatory behaviors are absent
or weak. Implicit and explicit attitudes often manifest very
differently in terms of cognitive decision-making and behav-
ior (Banaji, & Greenwald, 1995; Dovidio, Kawakami, &
Gaertner, 2002; Greenwald et al., 2002; Payne, 2001).
In a meta-analysis, Greenwald, Poehlman, Uhlmann, and
Banaji (2009) examined 156 studies that utilized both the
Implicit Association Test (IAT) and explicit attitude measures.
Their results indicate predictive utility for both types of mea-
sures with respect to relevant behaviors and physiological
responses; however, there were more variable predictive out-
comes for the explicit measures. In addition, for socially sensi-
tive attitudes, such as racial judgments, the predictive validity
of explicit measures was diminished. Thus, for topics for
which participants might be motivated to control their self-
presentation, explicit measures were less effective.
In the studies reported here, the participants did not show
overt sexism or racism in their ratings of occupational pres-
tige. They did not estimate that women's occupations might
be worth less in salary than men's work, as was the case
20 years ago. Decisions about salary and prestige require
some reasoned thought, and college students can consciously
alter any biases they might feel. As stated earlier, these col-
lege students are likely to hold gender equality as a conscious
value. However, participants did employ some gender ste-
reotypes regarding educational requirements and interest.
These are more subtle measures, without obvious sexist
overtones. For example, interest in an occupation can be
viewed as influenced by many factors, including the proba-
bility of success in the field, comfort level, and other cogni-
tive and emotional reactions to the occupation. Thus, college
students are less likely to cognitively guard against biased
responses on these types of measures, and implicit stereo-
types and biases may come through.
Limitations and Future Research
Although the comparison over 20 years is enhanced by using
the same type of sample, the method necessarily limits the
generalizability of the findings. These samples were drawn
from a liberal public college which draws students from pri-
marily politically liberal geographical regions. While some
researchers also have found diminishing gaps in perceptions
of occupational prestige by occupational gender (Goyder,
Guppy, & Thompson, 2003), other researchers continue to
find obvious gaps (e.g., Williams et al., 2010). Continued
research is needed to reconcile conflicting results. In addi-
tion, past research findings on race and occupational status
have provided varying patterns with respect to the impact of
racial identity on aspects of occupational prestige and suc-
cess. The results of the current studies suggest that occupa-
tional race and occupational gender interact in affecting
perceptions of status, but not in consistent ways across
occupations.
One promising avenue for continued research on gender,
race, and occupational prestige is the use of techniques to
measure implicit gender and race stereotyping with respect
to occupations. The IAT and other indirect measures to study
subtle, unconscious biases in perceptions of occupations are
logical, especially with participants who explicitly endorse
liberal attitudes about gender and race (cf. Matheus, 2011;
Rudman & Phelan, 2010; Williams et al., 2010).
What then can be concluded from the current research?
Have gender biases in perceptions of occupational prestige
changed in the past 20 years? In some regard, the answer is
yes. In the early 1990s, the wage gap was wider, average
educational achievement was lower for women, there were
fewer women in visible positions of authority, and research
showed that college students displayed overt gender biases
when judging the worth of gendered occupations. By 2011,
there were still wage gaps, but there has been progress in
terms of women's presence in the societal power structure. In
turn, college students' current perceptions of occupational
status are less overtly influenced by the gender of the rele-
vant labor force, although gendered perceptions of some
aspect of occupational attainment, such as personal interest
and educational requirements, still exist. Hopefully, the next
20 years will see gender biases in occupational perceptions
muted even further.
