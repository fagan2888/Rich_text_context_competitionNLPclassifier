Aims Serum cystatin C, a novel marker of kidney function, is reported to be superior to serum creatinine as a risk factor for
atherosclerotic disease, but associations may vary across vascular beds.
Methods
and results
A cross-sectional study of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in 3089 adult
participants aged 40þ from the 1999­2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Kidney function, assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), was determined from serum creatinine
and cystatin C using established equations. Peripheral arterial disease defined by an ankle brachial index ,0.90. Glo-
merular filtration rate estimated using cystatin C was more strongly associated with PAD compared with eGFR using
serum creatinine before and after multivariable adjustment. Further, after adjustment for cystatin C, kidney function
based on serum creatinine was no longer significantly associated with PAD. However, cystatin C remained signifi-
cantly associated with PAD even after adjustment for GFR estimated by serum creatinine. Compared with optimal
kidney function (eGFRserum creatinine
!60, eGFRcystatin C
.90), the odds ratio for PAD was 3.11 (95% confidence
interval 1.26­7.64) for preclinical CKD (eGFRserum creatinine
!60, eGFRcystatin C
,76.7) and 5.07 (3.01­8.52) for
`confirmed' CKD (eGFRserum creatinine
,60, eGFRcystatin C
,60).
Conclusion Chronic kidney disease was strongly and independently associated with PAD. Cystatin C was a more potent marker
of lower extremity PAD when compared with the serum creatinine equation currently used in clinical practice. Our
results suggest that cystatin C may have clinical utility when combined with serum creatinine in evaluation of individ-
uals who may have PAD.

Introduction
There is growing recognition that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is
independently associated with atherosclerotic disease. Previous
studies have documented the high risk of cardiovascular disease
among individuals with CKD.1,2 However, less is known of the
relationship of CKD to lower extremity peripheral arterial
disease (PAD), a common condition caused by the development
of atherosclerosis in the lower extremities. Limb amputation, a fre-
quent clinical complication of PAD, is common among individuals
with kidney disease3,4 and diabetes,5 but the association of subcli-
nical PAD and moderately decreased kidney function is not well
characterized. Serum creatinine is the most common clinical
marker of kidney function and is used in conjunction with math-
ematical equations to estimate the glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) and to diagnose and define the stages of CKD.6 Several
recent studies have shown an independent association between
CKD--as defined by serum creatinine-based estimating
equations--and PAD in the general population.7­ 9 Serum cystatin
C, a novel marker of kidney function, is thought to be less affected
by age, gender, and body composition than serum creatinine and
has been reported to be superior for the estimation of kidney
function, particularly in the presence of mild to moderate kidney
disease and in older individuals.10 ­14 An important clinical question

is whether cystatin C or GFR estimated from cystatin C is a marker
of atherosclerotic disease and if the magnitude of any association
differs from that for GFR estimated using creatinine.
The objective of this study was to investigate the association of
kidney function--as estimated from serum creatinine and cystatin
C--and PAD in a nationally representative sample of the US
adult population. We hypothesized that: (i) kidney function
would be associated with PAD independently of known cardiovas-
cular risk factors; (ii) GFR estimated using cystatin C would be
more strongly associated with PAD when compared with that esti-
mated from serum creatinine; and (iii) cystatin C would add
additional risk stratification information within currently defined
categories of kidney function using serum creatinine.
Methods
Study population
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is
an ongoing cross-sectional, multistage, stratified, clustered probability
sample of the US civilian non-institutionalized population. Detailed
in-person interviews, physical examinations, and blood samples were
obtained from 10 000 participants aged 12 or older in the 1999­
2002 survey.15 A subset (n ¼ 5718) of these participants including all
persons aged 60 or older and a 25% random sample of participants
aged ,60 years were selected for measurement of serum cystatin
C.16 Serum was available for the measurement of cystatin C on
98.6% of individuals selected for the substudy (n ¼ 5638). For the
present analyses, we further limited our study sample to individuals
non-missing information on lower extremity PAD (only assessed in
participants aged 40 and older), for a final study sample size of 3089
adults (83% of eligible participants).
Assessment of lower extremity peripheral
arterial disease
Peripheral arterial disease can be determined with high sensitivity and
specificity using the ratio of the systolic blood pressure in the ankle to
that in the arm (ankle brachial index, ABI).17,18 We defined PAD on the
basis of ABI measurements obtained from NHANES 1999­2002 in
participants aged 40 and over during the examination component of
the survey. In NHANES, the established ABI technique employed
measurement of systolic blood pressure at the right brachial artery
and at both posterior tibial arteries using Doppler ultrasound. If the
participant had a medical condition that did not permit the use of
right arm measurement, the left arm was used for brachial pressure
measurement. Systolic blood pressure was measured twice at each
limb site for participants aged 40­59 and once at each site for partici-
pants aged 60 and over. The left and right ABI measurements were
obtained by dividing the mean systolic blood pressure in the left and
right ankle, respectively, by the mean blood pressure in the arm. Per-
ipheral arterial disease was defined as an ABI ,0.90 in either leg. We
excluded individuals with ABI .1.5, values usually related to non-
compressible vessels in the legs.
Measures of kidney function
Blood samples were collected by trained personnel. Serum creatinine
was measured using a kinetic rate Jaffe method.19­21 To appropriately
estimate GFR, all serum creatinine measurements were re-calibrated
to standardized creatinine measurements obtained at the Cleveland
Clinic Research Laboratory (Cleveland, OH, USA) as detailed
recently.21 A re-calibration equation was applied to serum creatinine
in the 1999­2000 survey only (standard creatinine ¼ 0.147 þ
1.013 Â NHANES 1999­2000 uncalibrated serum creatinine). No
correction to the creatinine values in the 2001­2002 survey was
needed.21
Serum from the original blood collection in 1999­2002 was stored
at 2708C until 2006, when we measured cystatin C at the Cleveland
Clinical Research Laboratory. Samples were assayed for cystatin C with
a particle-enhanced immuno-nephelometric assay (N Latex Cystatin C,
Dade Behring, IL, USA).22
The estimation of kidney function, accounting for age, sex, and race
in serum creatinine-based estimating equations, is crucial as these
factors influence serum creatinine production. Serum creatinine-based
GFR was estimated using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal
Disease (MDRD) Study formula re-expressed to use standard
creatinine.23,24
Serum cystatin C concentrations are less related to age, sex, and
race, and we therefore estimated GFR from cystatin C using a single
variable equation consisting of a mathematical transformation of cysta-
tin C: eGFR ¼ 76.7 Â CysC21.19.25 This single variable equation is
equivalent to modelling raw cystatin C levels but with a transformation
to achieve commensurate units of estimated GFR; the ranking of
individuals is unchanged. We also evaluated a GFR equation, including
cystatin C in combination with age, sex, and race (cystatin C multivari-
able equation): eGFR ¼ 127.7 Â CysC21.17 Â age20.13 Â (0.91 if
female) Â (1.06 if black).
In all equations, estimated GFR is reported in mL/min/1.73 m2, race/
ethnicity was either black or not, and values that exceeded 200 mL/
min/1.73 m2 were truncated at that level. Kidney function was categor-
ized based on the classification system established by the National
Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative.26 Indi-
viduals with eGFR ,15 mL/min/1.73 m2 were excluded from analyses
of kidney function categories because estimates of this stage of kidney
disease are likely to be unreliable due to the small number of individ-
uals and the likelihood of being ill or receiving dialysis would depress
the response rate.
We also conducted analyses combining serum creatinine and cysta-
tin C eGFR categories, utilizing cystatin C as a `confirmatory' test. We
divided persons with normal kidney function (eGFR !60 by MDRD)
into categories according to cystatin C level, using a cystatin C cut
point of 1.0 mg/L (equivalent to eGFR 76.7 by serum cystatin C
using the single variable equation) to define `pre-clinical CKD',27 gen-
erating the following categories: eGFR !60 by MDRD and !90 by
cystatin C (`optimal' kidney function), eGFR !60 by MDRD and
76.7­89 by cystatin C (`low normal' kidney function), and eGFR
!60 by MDRD and ,76.7 by cystatin C (`pre-clinical' kidney
disease). In those persons defined as having CKD (eGFR 30­59 by
MDRD), we used cystatin C to `confirm' the diagnosis, classifying
these individuals into the following categories: eGFR ,30­59 by
MDRD and !60 by cystatin C (`unconfirmed' CKD) and eGFR
,30­59 by MDRD and ,60 by cystatin C (`confirmed' CKD). Individ-
uals with eGFR 15­29 by MDRD were defined as having severe CKD.6
Other study variables
The NHANES examination included measurement of height, weight,
and blood pressure. Hypertension was defined as a mean systolic
blood pressure of 140 mmHg or greater, a mean diastolic blood
pressure of 90 mmHg or greater, or hypertension medication use.
Total cholesterol was measured enzymatically.20 Hypercholesterolae-
mia was defined as a total cholesterol level 240 mg/dL or higher, or
medication use. Diabetes was defined by a self-reported physician diag-
nosis. Persons reporting `borderline diabetes' or solely reporting a
Kidney function estimated from serum creatinine and cystatin C and PAD 1919
diabetes diagnosis during pregnancy were considered non-diabetic.
Information on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking was based on self-
report during the questionnaire portion of the survey. A history of car-
diovascular disease was defined on the basis of a self-reported history
of coronary heart disease, angina, previous heart attack, or stroke.
Smoking status was determined using answers to the questions,
`Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your life?' and `Do you
now smoke cigarettes?' We also examined cotinine levels, a major
metabolite of nicotine, and a commonly used marker for both active
and second-hand cigarette smoke exposure. Serum cotinine was
measured by an HPLC/atmospheric-pressure ionization tandem mass
spectrometry method. Detailed information regarding the collection
of data in NHANES is available elsewhere.15
Statistical analysis
As cystatin C was measured on a subset of NHANES 1999­2002 par-
ticipants (25% stratified random sample of individuals with valid serum
creatinine levels), the original examination sampling weights require
modification to provide nationally representative estimates and
address potential bias. Modification of the original sampling weights
to account for both missing serum creatinine and cystatin C was per-
formed by the investigators (E.S. and J.C.) according to standard
methods,28 and protocols were reviewed and approved by the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The modified sampling
weights were applied in all analyses and standard errors for estimates
were obtained using the Taylor series (linearization) method.29
Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
were estimated using logistic regression models. All statistical analyses
were performed using Stata v10.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX,
USA) svy commands.
Protocols for conduct of NHANES were approved by the NCHS
institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all
participants. Both the NCHS and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg
School of Public Health institutional review boards approved the pro-
tocols for measurement of cystatin C from stored serum samples.
Results
The characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1.
Compared with individuals without PAD, those with PAD were
older, more likely to be non-Hispanic black, current or former
smokers, and more likely to have major cardiovascular risk
factors. Levels of serum creatinine, cystatin C, GFR estimated
using the serum creatinine equation (2005 MDRD formula), the
single variable cystatin C equation, and the multivariable cystatin
C equation all indicated lower average kidney function among indi-
viduals with PAD compared with those without PAD in this unad-
justed comparison.
The crude prevalence of CKD was much higher among individ-
uals with PAD compared with those without PAD or the overall
population. The prevalence estimates of CKD (eGFR ,60) using
the serum creatinine equation, cystatin C only, and the multivari-
able cystatin C equation were 37.0% (95% CI 28.1­45.9), 35.2%
(26.2­44.2), and 42.9% (34.6­51.3), respectively. In contrast, the
corresponding prevalence of CKD in the total population aged
40 and older by each of these equations was: 11.9% (10.0­13.8),
8.9% (7.3­10.5), and 12.2% (10.2­14.3).
Figure 1 displays the continuous unadjusted association between
eGFR and PAD for each GFR estimating equation. Lower kidney
function (lower estimated GFR) was strongly associated with an
increased probability of PAD across the spectrum of kidney func-
tion in this general population. Figure 1 illustrates the stronger
association of GFR estimated using cystatin C compared with
serum creatinine, particularly at lower levels of kidney function.
Indeed, cystatin C appears much more strongly associated with
PAD at estimated GFR levels below 60 when compared with esti-
mated GFR using serum creatinine.
Before conducting multivariable models, we examined the distri-
bution of risk factors across definitions of CKD using serum crea-
tinine and cystatin C (Table 2). These results show relative
differences in the strength of potentially important confounders
in the CKD­PAD association using different definitions of CKD.
Most factors were similar across the CKD definitions (Table 2)
with the exception of hypertension, history of cardiovascular
disease, and smoking status. In particular, the prevalence of
current smoking and serum cotinine level were substantially
higher in cystatin C-defined CKD compared with creatinine-
defined CKD. In multivariable models of CKD adjusted for all vari-
ables listed in Table 2, hypertension, history of cardiovascular
disease, and smoking all remained significantly associated with
cystatin C-defined CKD but not creatinine-defined CKD (data
not show). We adjusted for these risk factors in subsequent multi-
variable models of kidney function and PAD prevalence. Body mass
index and waist circumference were also more strongly associated
with GFR equations using cystatin C when compared with that
using serum creatinine; however, measures of adiposity were not
found to be important risk factors for PAD in this study.
The adjusted ORs for PAD by categories of kidney function are
presented in Table 3. Model 1 (adjusted for age only) shows a
strong, graded association between level of kidney function and
PAD across all kidney function equations. The association persisted
even after multivariable adjustment for important PAD risk factors
(age, sex, race/ethnicity, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterole-
mia, history of cardiovascular disease, and smoking status) (Model
2). The association of kidney function with PAD was consistently
stronger using GFR estimated from cystatin C compared with
serum creatinine-based GFR. Models 3 and 4 are the same as
Model 2, but further simultaneously adjusted for the other
measure of kidney function. In Model 3, the logistic models of
eGFR categories defined by serum creatinine are adjusted for all
variables in Model 2 plus additional adjustment for categories of
eGFR defined by the single variable cystatin C equation. Similarly,
the logistic models of eGFR categories and CKD defined by cysta-
tin C are adjusted for eGFR defined by the serum creatinine eGFR
equation. Model 4 is similar to Model 3 except that the simul-
taneous adjustment for kidney function is conducted with the
respective eGFR kidney function variable modelled continuously
(instead of clinical categories). Models 3 and 4 demonstrate that
after adjustment for cystatin C (using the single variable equation),
kidney function categories defined by serum creatinine are no
longer significantly associated with PAD. However, all kidney func-
tion categories defined by cystatin C using either the single or the
multivariable equations remain significantly associated with PAD
even after adjustment for eGFR estimated by serum creatinine.
Sensitivity analyses (data not shown) using models with additional
adjustment for serum cotinine and measures of adiposity (body

mass index and waist circumference), stratification by smoking
status, and exclusion of individuals with a history of cardiovascular
disease did not appreciably alter any of these results.
The adjusted ORs for PAD according to categories of kidney
function defined by both serum creatinine and cystatin C are pre-
sented in Table 4. A dose­response relation was present across all
six kidney function categories defined using a combination of
serum creatinine and cystatin C levels. Indeed, among persons
with normal kidney function defined by serum creatinine (eGFR
!60 by MDRD), cystatin C remained significantly associated with
prevalent PAD. The OR of PAD for `pre-clinical CKD' was 3.11
(1.26­7.64). Among persons with CKD defined by serum creati-
nine (eGFR ,60 by MDRD), cystatin C also appeared to further
refine risk categories. The ORs of PAD for CKD `unconfirmed'
and `confirmed' by cystatin C were 3.34 (1.61­6.91) and 5.07
(3.01­8.52), respectively. Severe CKD (defined by eGFR 15­29
by MDRD) was strongly associated with PAD (OR 9.11, 2.65­
31.26).

Kidney function estimated from serum creatinine and cystatin C and PAD 1921
Discussion
We found a high prevalence of CKD, ranging from 35 to 43%,
among individuals with PAD defined by an ABI ,0.90. Because
the presence of PAD is known to confer a high risk for cardiovas-
cular outcomes, the condition is considered a coronary heart
disease `risk equivalent'.30,31 This is of particular importance in
the setting of low kidney function as CKD is also independently
associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular events.1,2 The
high prevalence of CKD in persons with PAD suggests that screen-
ing for CKD might be considered in individuals with a low ABI and/
or symptomatic PAD.
This study demonstrates a robust, graded, and independent associ-
ation between kidney function--assessed using serum creatinine and/
or serum cystatin C--and PAD. The association was observed across
the normal range of kidney function in a nationally representative
sample of US adults 40 and older. Cystatin C and GFR estimated
using cystatin C were more strongly associated with PAD than GFR
estimated using serum creatinine, particularly at low GFR levels.
Indeed, our models with simultaneous adjustment for both serum
creatinine and cystatin C suggest that cystatin C captures most of

theinformationrelated totheassociation ofkidney function with PAD
in this population. We also found that using cystatin C in combination
with serum creatinine further refined the association of kidney func-
tion with PAD. `Preclinical kidney disease' (elevated cystatin in the
context of `normal' kidney function defined by eGFR MDRD)27 was
significantly associated with PAD (OR 3.11, 1.26­7.64) even after
multivariable adjustment. In persons with CKD (eGFR ,60 by
MDRD), cystatin C also further refined risk, suggesting the possible
clinical utility of using cystatin C as a `confirmatory' test for identifying
individuals at high risk for clinical outcomes. The advantage of the con-
firmatory approach is that serum creatinine is already routinely
measured in nearly all PAD patients.

Kidney function estimated from serum creatinine and cystatin C and PAD 1923
To our knowledge, these are the first nationally representative
data to demonstrate an association between kidney function esti-
mated by cystatin C in the normal range and lower extremity
PAD. Previous studies have not directly compared serum creati-
nine and cystatin C GFR estimating equations in their association
with clinical outcomes.
Recently, a case­control study demonstrated higher levels of
cystatin C in PAD patients compared with controls.32 A large
cohort study in elderly adults found that cystatin C was associated
with incident severe PAD (defined by surgical procedures, related
hospitalizations, and amputation), whereas creatinine level and
serum creatinine-based eGFR were not associated with future
PAD events.33 The authors found the risk of PAD associated
with cystatin C did not increase in a stepwise fashion; the observed
increase was present only at the highest quintile of cystatin
C. However, the overall number of severe PAD events observed
in this elderly cohort was small. In contrast, our data suggest
that kidney function is associated with PAD across the normal
range, with no evidence for a threshold effect.
Our results contribute to the debate regarding the clinical utility
of serum cystatin C. This study adds to the accumulating evidence
that moderately impaired kidney function may play a role in the
development of cardiovascular disease.34,35 Recent data suggest
that GFR estimating equations based on cystatin C may provide
similar but less confounded (by muscle mass and co-morbidities)
estimates of kidney function than equations using serum creati-
nine,25 and previous studies have shown that cystatin C is more
highly correlated with measured GFR than is serum creati-
nine.12,14,34 Our results suggest that GFR equations using cystatin
C are also more strongly associated with PAD when compared
with the currently used serum creatinine MDRD formula.
Our findings also raise the possibility that cystatin C may be a
risk marker for atherosclerotic disease through mechanisms
other than kidney function. We found an independent association
of cystatin C with PAD even after adjustment for kidney function
estimated from serum creatinine. Nonetheless, it is unclear from
these data whether this independent association is a result of
incomplete adjustment for kidney function--particularly when
muscle mass is reduced--or whether this finding represents a
true independent (non-renal) association of cystatin C with
lower extremity disease.
Important limitations of this study include reliance on estimated
GFR rather than measured GFR, a more precise but also more
burdensome measure of kidney function not feasible to obtain in
routine clinical or research settings. Because this is a cross-
sectional study, we also cannot determine the directionality of
the observed associations nor draw firm conclusions regarding
causality.
Some strengths of this study include the large sample size, the
rigorous measurement of risk factors and serum markers of
kidney function by trained personnel according to standardized
protocols, and the nationally representative study design. Kidney
function and ABI were assessed in all participants regardless of
the participant's or their physician's awareness of the condition.
Finally, the cross-section design is similar to the clinical situation
where a physician is faced with a PAD patient with or without
CKD.
In conclusion, we found that CKD was strongly and indepen-
dently associated with PAD, suggesting that kidney function may
be related to the development of atherosclerosis in the lower
extremities. We also found that cystatin C was a much more
potent marker of lower extremity PAD when compared with
the serum creatinine equation currently used in clinical practice
to estimate kidney function. Indeed, the association of cystatin C
with PAD persisted even after adjustment for kidney function esti-
mated from serum creatinine. Ultimately, our results suggest that
cystatin C may be an important marker of atherosclerotic vascular
disease in the lower extremities and may have clinical utility when
combined with serum creatinine in the evaluation of individuals
who may have PAD.
