OBJECTIVE -- To determine the proportion of the American population who would merit
metformin treatment, according to recent American Diabetes Association (ADA) consensus panel
recommendations to prevent or delay the development of diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Risk factors were evaluated in 1,581 Screen-
ing for Impaired Glucose Tolerance (SIGT), 2,014 Third National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES III), and 1,111 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
2005­2006 (NHANES 2005­2006) subjects, who were non-Hispanic white and black, without
known diabetes. Criteria for consideration of metformin included the presence of both impaired
fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), with 1 additional diabetes risk
factor: age 60 years, BMI 35 kg/m2, family history of diabetes, elevated triglycerides, reduced
HDL cholesterol, hypertension, or A1C 6.0%.
RESULTS -- Isolated IFG, isolated IGT, and IFG and IGT were found in 18.0, 7.2, and 8.2%
of SIGT; 22.3, 6.4, and 9.4% of NHANES III; and 21.8, 5.0, and 9.0% of NHANES 2005­2006
subjects, respectively. In SIGT, NHANES III, and NHANES 2005­2006, criteria for metformin
consideration were met in 99, 96, and 96% of those with IFG and IGT; 31, 29, and 28% of all
those with IFG; and 53, 57, and 62% of all those with IGT (8.1, 9.1, and 8.7% of all subjects),
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS -- More than 96% of individuals with both IFG and IGT are likely to meet
ADA consensus criteria for consideration of metformin. Because 28% of all those with IFG met
the criteria, providers should perform oral glucose tolerance tests to find concomitant IGT in all
patients with IFG. To the extent that our findings are representative of the U.S. population, 1
in 12 adults has a combination of pre-diabetes and risk factors that may justify consideration of
metformin treatment for diabetes prevention.
Diabetes Care 33:49­54, 2010
Diabetes is a public health epidemic
(1) associated with high morbidity,
mortality (1), and cost (2). Cur-
rently, an estimated 38 million Americans
have the disease, nearly 40% of which is
undiagnosed, and another 87 million
have pre-diabetes: impaired fasting glu-
cose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose toler-
ance (IGT) (3). Diabetes develops
insidiously over several years, during
which time glucose metabolism
progresses slowly from normal to pre-
diabetes and then more rapidly to diabetes.
Based on observational and prospective
studies, 25­40% of individuals with pre-
diabetes go on to develop diabetes over 3­8
years (4­6), and there is evidence of com-
plications in 50% of patients at the time of
diagnosis of diabetes (7).
Because progression from pre-
diabetes can be prevented or delayed by
lifestyle change and/or medication (4­6),
the American Diabetes Association (ADA)
has issued a consensus statement recom-
mending early identification and preven-
tive treatment in high-risk individuals
(8). The panel statement recommends
that individuals with both IFG and IGT
and one additional risk factor (age 60
years, BMI 35 kg/m2, family history of
diabetes in first-degree relative, elevated
triglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol,
or A1C 6.0%) should be considered for
treatment with metformin, in addition to
lifestyle modification, which includes
weight loss and physical activity.
To determine what proportion of the
American population presenting with ei-
ther IFG or IGT would merit consider-
ation for metformin treatment in
accordance with the recent ADA recom-
mendations, we evaluated healthy volun-
teers without known diabetes who were
screened for diabetes/pre-diabetes by the
75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- In cross-sectional
analyses, we evaluated the likelihood
that Americans with previously unrec-
ognized pre-diabetes would meet ADA
consensus panel recommendations for
consideration of metformin in addition
to change in lifestyle. Criteria for con-
sideration of metformin included the
presence of both IFG and IGT, with 1
additional diabetes risk factor: age 60
years, BMI 35 kg/m2, family history of
diabetes, elevated triglycerides, re-
duced HDL cholesterol, hypertension,
or A1C 6.0%.
Between 1 December 2005 and 31
March 2008, subjects were recruited to
participate in the Screening for Impaired
Glucose Tolerance (SIGT) study (9), a
cross-sectional study that was approved

The invitation to participate was extended
to employees of the Grady Health System,
Emory HealthCare, and Emory University
and Morehouse Schools of Medicine as
well as to members of the community.
Criteria for eligibility were age 18 years,
non-Hispanic white or black race, no
prior diagnosis of diabetes, not pregnant
or breast-feeding, not taking glucocorti-
coids, and being well enough to have
worked during the previous week (with-
out requiring actual employment). Dur-
ing recruitment, 4,024 individuals
expressed initial interest in the study,
among whom 2,111 were scheduled for
first visits (selected largely on the basis of
need to balance participant sex and race),
1,658 completed first visits, and 1,581
completed the protocol. All study visits
were performed in the General Clinical
Research Centers at Emory University
Hospital and Grady Memorial Hospital.
All subjects gave written informed con-
sent before study participation.
We also evaluated subjects who took
part in the Third National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey (NHANES III)
(10) and the continuous National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005­
2006 (NHANES 2005­2006) (11).
NHANES is a program of studies con-
ducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics of the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention that include both in-
terviews and physical examinations in a
nationally representative sample to assess
the health and nutritional status of adults
and children in the U.S. NHANES III was
conducted between 1988 and 1994. In
1999, the survey became a continuous
program examining 5,000 individuals
each year, which includes NHANES
2005­2006.
Measurements in the SIGT study
population
Demographic information was collected
by self-report and included family history
of diabetes in a first-degree relative, race,
history of hypertension, history of diabe-
tes, and current medication use. Height
was measured with a stadiometer after
shoes were removed. Weight was mea-
sured using digital scales with subjects in
light clothing. Blood pressure was mea-
sured with digital manometers after sub-
jects had been seated quietly for 5 min.
Classification of glucose tolerance
was determined by a 75-g OGTT in accor-
dance with ADA diagnostic criteria (12):
normal glucose tolerance (NGT)--fasting
plasma glucose (FPG) 100 mg/dl and
2-h postchallenge glucose 140 mg/dl;
isolated IFG--FPG 100­125 mg/dl and
2-h postchallenge glucose 140 mg/dl;
isolated IGT--FPG 100 mg/dl and 2-h
postchallenge glucose 140­199 mg/dl;
any IFG--FPG 100­125 mg/dl and 2-h
postchallenge glucose 199 mg/dl; any
IGT--FPG 126 mg/dl and 2-h post-
challenge glucose 140­199 mg/dl; com-
bined IFG and IGT--FPG 100 ­125
mg/dl and 2-h postchallenge glucose
140 ­199 mg/dl; and diabetes--FPG
126 mg/dl or 2-h postchallenge glucose
200 mg/dl. Isolated IFG was further
subcategorized into fasting glucose be-
tween 100 and 109 mg/dl (IFG 100­109)
and fasting glucose between 110 and 125
mg/dl (IFG 110­125). All OGTTs were
begun before 11:00 A.M. after an overnight
fast, with blood samples drawn at base-
line, 1 h, and 2 h. Blood samples were also
obtained for measurement of plasma lip-
ids and A1C. Plasma glucose samples
were obtained using sodium fluoride/
oxalate preservative. Plasma samples
were centrifuged, separated, and frozen
within 30 min. All samples were stored at
80°C until assayed. Chemical analyses
were performed in the central clinical lab-
oratory of the Grady Health System using
an LX-20 analyzer (Beckman Coulter,
Brea, CA); A1C measurement with this
system is National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program-certified.
Statistical analysis
In the NHANES III database, a subset of
adults aged 40 years had an OGTT per-
formed. We analyzed only those who had
no known history of diabetes, had com-
pleted the OGTT in the morning before
11:00 A.M. after an overnight fast of at least
9 h, for whom the 2-h postchallenge glu-
cose level was measured between 100 and
135 min after ingestion of the glucose
load, and had a survey weight value 0.
Among this subset (n  2,833), we in-
cluded only those who were non-
Hispanic black or white (to match our
study population) (n  2,057).
In the NHANES 2005­2006 popula-
tion, all subjects 12 years who were
seen in the morning session were asked to
have an OGTT performed. Subjects were
eligible for the OGTT if they had fasted
overnight for at least 9 h, reported no use
of oral medications or insulin for diabetes,
were not pregnant, did not have hemo-
philia, and did not receive cancer chemo-
therapy in the previous 3 weeks. All blood
samples for the 2-h glucose measurement
were drawn between 100 and 135 min
after ingestion of the glucose load. For our
analysis, we included only those who
were 18 years, had no known history of
diabetes, were non-Hispanic black or
white (to match our study population),
and had a survey weight value 0 (n 
1,154). Because some subjects had more
than one blood pressure measurement,
the average of the measurements was used
for the analysis.
For the SIGT, NHANES III, and
NHANES 2005­2006 subjects, age, BMI,
and A1C were categorized using the cut-
offs recommended by the ADA: age 60
years, BMI 35 kg/m2, and A1C 6.0%
(8). Other risk factors for diabetes that
were not specifically defined by the ADA
were categorized according to the Ameri-
can Heart Association/National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute (AHA/NHLBI)
diagnostic criteria for metabolic syn-
drome (12): presence of hypertension by
history, systolic blood pressure 130
mmHg or diastolic blood pressure 85
mmHg, triglyceride level 150 mg/dl,
and HDL cholesterol 40 mg/dl in men
and 50 mg/dl in women. Given the high
number of subjects in NHANES III and
NHANES 2005­2006 whose reporting of
the diabetes status of one or more first-
degree relatives was either not known or
left blank (NHANES III, n  1,163;
NHANES 2005­2006, n  116), relatives
whose diabetes status was missing or not
known were assumed to not have diabe-
tes, a method that was also implemented
for the analysis of the SIGT study group.
In addition, subjects with missing values
for the remaining risk factors were ex-
cluded from analysis (NHANES III: 1
missing blood pressure measurement or
hypertension history, 7 missing A1C val-
ues, 27 missing triglyceride values, and
35 missing HDL cholesterol values;
NHANES 2005­2006: 32 missing blood
pressure measurements or hypertension
history, 8 missing BMI measurements, 2
missing A1C values, 4 missing triglycer-
ide values, and 4 missing HDL values),
leaving 2,014 subjects in NHANES III and
1,111 subjects in NHANES 2005­2006
to be analyzed for metformin consider-
ation.
Means and frequencies were deter-
mined in aggregate and by subgroup anal-
ysis of the different glucose tolerance
categories. All SIGT analyses were per-
formed using SPSS 15.0 (SPSS, Chicago,
IL). All NHANES III and NHANES 2005­
2006 analyses were conducted using
SUDAAN statistical software (version 10)

to account for the complex survey design,
and all estimates were weighted (RTI In-
ternational, Research Triangle Park, NC).
RESULTS -- Among 1,581 volunteers
who completed OGTTs in the SIGT
study, average age was 48 years and BMI
was 30.3 kg/m2, 42% were male, and 58%
were black (Table 1). In the selected
NHANES III population (n  2,014), the
average age was 55 years and BMI was
27.3 kg/m2, 47% were male, and 10%
were black, and in NHANES 2005­2006
(n  1,111), the average age was 46 years
and BMI was 28.5 kg/m2, 49% were male,
and 13% were black (Table 1).
In the SIGT population, 62.1% had
normal fasting glucose and NGT, 18.0%
had isolated IFG, 7.2% had isolated IGT,
8.2% had both IFG and IGT, and 4.6%
had diabetes, similar to the proportions in
NHANES III (54.3% had NGT, 22.3%
had isolated IFG, 6.4% had isolated IGT,
9.4% had both IFG and IGT, and 7.6%
had diabetes) and NHANES 2005­2006
(59.1% had NGT, 21.8% had isolated
IFG, 5.0% had isolated IGT, 9.0% had
both IFG and IGT, and 5.2% had diabe-
tes). All three populations had a compa-
rable portion with either IFG or IGT
(33.4% in SIGT, 38.1% NHANES III, and
35.8% in NHANES 2005­2006).
When the associated risk factors for
diabetes, as specified by the ADA consen-
sus statement (8), were considered,
among those with both IFG and IGT, the
presence of each risk factor was generally
higher among SIGT subjects, compared
with subjects in NHANES III and
NHANES 2005­2006, with the exception
of elevated triglycerides and A1C levels
(Table 2). Even with the differences in the
prevalence of risk factors, almost all sub-
jects with both IFG and IGT in all three
populations had at least one risk factor
(99% in SIGT, 96% in NHANES III, and
96% in NHANES 2005­2006), which
was similar among those with IFG (iso-
lated or with IGT: 99% in SIGT, 96% in
NHANES III, and 83% in NHANES
2005­2006) and those with IGT (isolated
or with IFG: 99% in SIGT, 96% in
NHANES III, and 94% in NHANES
2005­2006). Among all subjects with
IFG (isolated or with IGT), one-quarter to
one-third (31% in SIGT, 29% in
NHANES III, and 28% in NHANES
2005­2006) met the recommended crite-
ria for metformin treatment, and among
all subjects with IGT (isolated or with
IFG), one-half to two-thirds (53% in
SIGT, 57% in NHANES III, and 62% in
NHANES 2005­2006) did so (Fig. 1).
Overall, 1 in 12 individuals in these
populations met the criteria for consider-
ation of metformin (8.1% in SIGT, 9.1%
in NHANES III, and 8.7% in NHANES
2005­2006).
CONCLUSIONS -- In consideration
of the enormous public health impact of
diabetes and the evidence of benefit
from pharmacological treatment for the
prevention of diabetes, the ADA issued
a consensus statement recommending
preventive treatment in individuals at
high risk of developing diabetes, defined
as those with more severe pre-diabetes

(both IFG and IGT as well as an additional
risk factor) (8). To determine the propor-
tion of individuals who would be targeted
by such a recommendation, we examined
a relatively healthy population without
previously diagnosed diabetes (SIGT) and
representative samples of the U.S. popu-
lation (NHANES III and NHANES 2005­
2006) and found that one-quarter to one-
third had pre-diabetes. Among those with
IFG, nearly one-third of subjects met the
criteria for consideration of metformin
treatment to prevent diabetes in accor-
dance with the recent ADA consensus
statement, more than one-half of all of the
subjects with IGT qualified, and almost all
of those with both IFG and IGT qualified.
Overall, 8­9% met the recommended cri-
teria. Assuming that our data are general-
izable to the U.S. population, 24
million Americans might benefit from
pharmacological treatment in addition to
lifestyle modification.
The epidemic of diabetes and the in-
sidious onset of its complications have
prompted a call for early identification
and preventive treatment of the disease.
Diabetes is currently the leading cause of
blindness, end-stage renal disease requir-
ing dialysis, and nontraumatic amputa-
tions in the U.S. and increases the risk for
cardiovascular disease and stroke by two-
to fourfold, compared with those without
diabetes (1). It is the seventh leading
cause of death (1) and in 2007 cost $174
billion in both direct and indirect health
care expenditures (2). In addition, the
prevalence of diabetes has been on the rise
in the adolescent population (13), indi-
cating that the epidemic is likely to con-
tinue into the next generation.
Pre-diabetes, the stage preceding the
development of diabetes, increases the
risk for the development of diabetes, such
that 25­39% of patients with IFG or IGT
go on to develop diabetes over a period of
5­10 years (14,15). Moreover, pre-
diabetes alone has been associated with
an increased risk for the development of
cardiovascular disease (16,17) and micro-
vascular complications typically seen
with diabetes (18). Given these risks, pro-
spective studies have been conducted to
identify preventive treatment. In addition
to lifestyle modification, pharmacological
treatment with acarbose (5), rosiglitazone
(6), orlistat (19), or metformin (4) has
shown efficacy in preventing or delaying
the onset of diabetes in individuals with
pre-diabetes. The relative risk reduction
for diabetes in the pre-diabetic popula-
tion was 25% over 3.3 years in patients
treated with acarbose (5), 52­62% over
2­4 years with orlistat (19), 62% over 3
years with rosiglitazone (6), and 26­31%
over 2.5­2.8 years with metformin (4).
However, because many individuals with
pre-diabetes are generally healthy, the
benefit of preventive treatment must out-
weigh any associated side effects or addi-
tional risks, particularly because none of
these medications have U.S. Food and
Drug Administration approval for the in-
dication of diabetes prevention. Gastroin-
testinal side effects are commonly
associated with acarbose (5) and orlistat
(19), leading to poor patient compliance,
whereas an increased risk of bone loss
Figure 1--Prevalence of metformin indication, stratified by glucose tolerance category. Metformin is indicated per the ADA consensus statement
criteria of the presence of both IFG and IGT and one of the following diabetes risk factors: age 60 years, BMI 35 kg/m2, family history of diabetes,
elevated triglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol, and A1C 6.0% (8). Risk factors for diabetes that were not specifically defined by the ADA were
categorized according to the AHA/NHLBI diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome (12): presence of hypertension by history, systolic blood
pressure 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure 85 mmHg, triglyceride level 150 mg/dl, and HDL cholesterol 40 mg/dl in men and 50 mg/dl
in women. Glucose tolerance categories are as follows: IFG 100­109, FPG levels 100­109 mg/dl and 2-h postchallenge plasma glucose 140 mg/dl;
IFG 110­125, FPG 110­125 mg/dl and 2-h postchallenge plasma glucose 140 mg/dl; all IFG, isolated IFG (FPG 100­125 mg/dl and 2-h
postchallenge plasma glucose 140 mg/dl); IGT, isolated IGT; and IFG 100­125  IGT, all IFG and IGT.

(20), worsening or new-onset edema
(21), and heart failure (22) are associated
with rosiglitazone. Therefore, metformin,
which has been used for many years and is
both generally well tolerated and rela-
tively safe, has become the leading candi-
date for preventive treatment.
In addition to the recommendations
of the ADA, the American College of En-
docrinology (ACE) has recently issued
their consensus statement on the manage-
ment of pre-diabetes (23). Similar to the
ADA recommendations, the ACE state-
ment recognizes the need for preventive
treatment, beginning with lifestyle modi-
fication, but also emphasizes the impor-
tance of treating relevant comorbid
conditions, such as hypertension, hyper-
cholesterolemia, and obesity, and pro-
vides a looser set of criteria regarding the
initiation of pharmacological treatment.
Acarbose and metformin are their recom-
mended treatments for individuals who
are at high risk of developing diabetes,
which include, but are not limited to,
those with IFG, IGT, and/or the metabolic
syndrome, worsening glycemia, cardio-
vascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease, a history of gestational diabetes,
or polycystic ovary syndrome. Taking
into account the target populations as de-
fined by the ADA and the ACE, 8% of
Americans could benefit from pharmaco-
logical treatment to prevent or delay de-
velopment of diabetes.
Use of pharmacological agents for the
many Americans who may benefit from
preventive treatment would incur sub-
stantial costs: at current generic rates for
metformin, possibly $4/month  12
months  24 million Americans  $1.15
billion per year. However, several studies
suggest that diabetes prevention or delay
with metformin is likely to be cost-
effective and/or cost-saving (24); further
evaluation using a variety of cost analysis
methods may be required to reach a de-
finitive conclusion regarding the cost of
preventive treatment.
To our knowledge, our findings are
the first evaluation of the proportion of
relatively healthy individuals who might
benefit from metformin treatment for the
prevention or delay of development of di-
abetes. However, our study has limita-
tions. Because all SIGT subjects were
recruited on a volunteer basis, there may
have been a selection bias toward higher
family history of diabetes and/or other
risk factors for diabetes. Therefore, the
SIGT population may represent a group
of individuals at higher risk. However, be-
cause many SIGT subjects were recruited
from university and health care settings,
they may also follow healthier lifestyles,
which could offset such a bias. Moreover,
the proportion with diabetes or pre-
diabetes in SIGT was no higher than that
in NHANES III and was comparable to
that in the more recent NHANES 2005­
2006, both of which represent random-
ized, stratified samples of the American
population.
The morbidity, mortality, and cost of
the epidemic of diabetes have prompted a
call for primary prevention of diabetes in
high-risk individuals by the use of met-
formin in addition to lifestyle changes. To
the extent that our findings are represen-
tative of the U.S. population, close to 1 in
12 American adults may meet the recom-
mended guidelines for consideration of
metformin treatment for diabetes preven-
tion or delay. Notably, eligibility for met-
formin use appeared to be almost
completely determined by impaired glu-
cose metabolism alone, because 99% of
the SIGT population and 96% of the
NHANES populations with both IFG and
IGT had at least one risk factor. Therefore,
once the presence of both IFG and IGT
has been established, the presence of ad-
ditional risk factors could almost be as-
sumed, and initiation of metformin
should be considered. Moreover, because
nearly one-third of all subjects with IFG
met the criteria for metformin treatment,
providers should perform OGTTs in all
patients with IFG to test for the presence
of IGT (or unrecognized diabetes) and
thereby determine whether they merit
consideration of metformin treatment.
