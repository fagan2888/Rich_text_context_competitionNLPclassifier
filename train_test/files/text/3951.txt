Abstract
Reducing avoidable emergency department (ED) visits is an important health system goal. This is a retrospective cohort
study of the impact of a primary care intervention including an in-hospital, free, adult clinic for poor uninsured patients on
ED visit rates and emergency severity at a nonprofit hospital. We studied adult ED visits during August 16, 2009-August
15, 2011 (preintervention) and August 16, 2011-August 15, 2014 (postintervention). We compared pre- versus post-
mean annual visit rates and discharge emergency severity index (ESI; triage and resource use­based, calculated Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality categories) among high-users (3 ED visits in 12 months) and occasional users. Annual
adult ED visit volumes were 16 372 preintervention (47.5% by high-users), versus 18 496 postintervention. High-users' mean
annual visit rates were 5.43 (top quartile) and 0.94 (bottom quartile) preintervention, versus 3.21 and 1.11, respectively, for
returning high-users, postintervention (all P < .001). Postintervention, the visit rates of new high-users were lower (lowest
and top quartile rates, 0.6 and 3.23) than preintervention high-users' rates in the preintervention period. Visit rates of the
top quartile of occasional users also declined. Subgroup analysis of medically uninsured high-users showed similar results.
Upon classifying preintervention high-users by emergency severity, postintervention mean ESI increased 24.5% among
the lowest ESI quartile, and decreased 12.2% among the top quartile. Pre- and post-intervention sample demographics
and comorbidities were similar. The observed reductions in overall ED visit rates, particularly low-severity visits; highest
reductions observed among high-users and the top quartile of occasional users; and the pattern of changes in emergency
severity support a positive impact of the primary care intervention.

Original Research
Introduction
Emergency departments (EDs) are mission-critical for hos-
pitals, and a key source of inpatient admissions, accounting
for 50% of all inpatient admissions nationally in 2011.
About 14.7% of ED visits end in inpatient admission.1-3
However, EDs also present financial and medical resource
challenges, being mandated to provide care to all patients
under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor
Act. In 2011, uninsured patients accounted for 16% of 131
million ED visits, nationwide.3 ED crowding steadily
increased since 1997 through 2007, partly due to ED clo-
sures exceeding new EDs opened by 23.7%, while ED visit
volumes increased 30%.4,5 Since 2003, crowding has been
aggravated by a new role served by EDs, as intermediate
care zones (Observational Units) to preempt medically
unnecessary inpatient admissions.2 These developments
have led to the current ED capacity crisis, requiring evi-
dence-based initiatives to reduce nonemergent ED visits.
The Society for Academic Emergency Medicine's ED
Crowding Task Force noted that ED crowding has resulted in
several adverse impacts on patient outcomes related to

patient safety, care timeliness, patient centeredness, effi-
ciency, effectiveness, and equity.6-8 Suboptimal outcomes
noted were delayed life-saving care (eg, pneumonia, myo-
cardial infarction), increased mortality, and increased hospi-
tal-acquired infection rates.6,9 We used a before-after,
observational cohort study design to examine the impact of
free primary care access via an in-hospital primary care
clinic on annual ED visit frequency and mean emergency
severity of adult high-users.
Methods
Study Design
This is a retrospective, observational study of one nonprofit,
religious missionary hospital's attempt to reduce low-sever-
ity ED visits through a primary care intervention. The hospi-
tal is located in the inner-city neighborhood of Columbia,
South Carolina, with pockets of minority- and poor-popula-
tion concentration. In the hospital vicinity, there are 2 other
functioning EDs--one about 3 miles away at a county non-
profit hospital that serves as a teaching hospital for the
University of South Carolina School of Medicine, and
another at a nonprofit secular hospital in an adjacent county
about 8 miles away in a different direction. The teaching hos-
pital ED is typically overcrowded, known for its long ED
waiting time. We studied adult ED patients' visit patterns at
the study hospital before and after implementation of a pri-
mary care intervention at a nonprofit urban hospital in South
Carolina. Preintervention period patients, classified into ED
high-users and occasional users, were studied for their mean
annual visit rates and emergency severity, before and after
the clinic start date. We also compared preintervention high-
users with new high-users of the postintervention period.
On August 16, 2011, the hospital established a primary
care intervention that included an adult walk-in primary care
clinic on-campus, which remains operational to date. The
intervention consisted of 2 components, an adult primary
care clinic on-campus, free of cost for uninsured patients
under 200% of poverty. Another component of the interven-
tion was to actively urge insured ED patients who were ED
high-users or having a chronic disease/primary care­pre-
ventable condition, to either acquire a primary care physician
(PCP) if they did not have one, or regularly visit their exist-
ing PCP. The hospital management sent the ED staff a direc-
tive to educate qualifying patients at discharge about the
importance of primary care for their condition, and to (1)
visit their own PCP regularly, (2) visit one of the hospital's
primary care practices (if insured but did not have a PCP), or
(3) visit the clinic if uninsured. Uninsured patients below
200% of poverty income qualified for free clinic services.
Patient education at discharge consisted of a one-time, short
conversation by the ED staff nurse, reinforced, in some cases
with a detailed work-up by the clinic social worker if she was
available. ED staff compliance with the directive was not
monitored, and the predischarge advice was subject to the
prevailing urgencies in the ED environment.
The clinic is free for uninsured patients up to 200% of
poverty income (self-reported by the patient with minimal
supporting documentation), and it charges a modest, sliding-
scale fee above this income. It is staffed by an internal medi-
cine, osteopathy-trained physician; a nurse-practitioner;
nurse; social worker (to assist chronically ill patients with
sociomedical needs, and liaise with charity care sources for
pharmacy, laboratory, and imaging); and medical assistants.
Clinic hours are Monday to Wednesday 8 am to 4:30 pm,
Thursday 10 am to 7 pm, and Friday 8 am to 12 pm, supple-
mented by phone access to on-call physicians (for registered
clinic patients) during off-clinic hours and weekends. The
clinic PCP and staff provide a primary care medical home
environment, including education about primary care and
self-management of chronic conditions. After-hours call ser-
vice is shared by PCPs of the hospital's 7 office-based prac-
tices including the clinic. The physician on call logs in
remotely to access the electronic medical record (EMR) sys-
tem, evaluates the patient's medical history and resolves the
call as appropriate (eg, verbal advice or reassurance, calling
in repeat prescriptions, advice to attend the clinic the next
day or the ED immediately).
Free clinical care is complemented by orchestrating
patient access to a network of charity care options available
in the region. The social worker provides navigation assis-
tance for the paperwork needed to access prescriptions
through Welvista, a statewide, charitable donation-supported,
mail-order pharmacy that dispenses free medications donated
by leading pharmaceutical manufacturers for uninsured
patients. This source is reinforced by GoodRx, an Internet-
based, discounted prescription drug program, and partner-
ships with low-cost generic drug offerings by large retailers
(eg, Walmart). Together, these initiatives have resulted in
almost full access for indigent patients to either free or neg-
ligible cost medications including most state-of-the-art pre-
scription drugs. For essential laboratory services, the clinic
has negotiated very low patient co-pays ($5 for basic lab
work) with the leading corporate provider of lab services in
the South Carolina Midlands. Specialized lab tests are pro-
vided as a charitable donation by the same firm on a case-by-
case basis. Similar arrangements are in place for radiology
services, supplemented by gratuitous service by the hospital-
employed own radiologists/hematologists/other physicians
and gratuitous use of the hospital's diagnostic equipment
when the out of pocket costs of external providers are beyond
a patient's financial reach. Limited specialist services are
provided through a low-cost referral network maintained by
a nearby rural county hospital, which includes this clinic in
its network. These arrangements are supplemented by gratu-
itous consultations by the hospital's specialists when needed.
Most patients, however, are managed by the clinic internist
and nurse. Specifically, ED high-users with high medical
need are eligible for free hospital outpatient procedures
Tsai et al 3
including imaging, free of charge. In addition to active refer-
ral of qualifying ED patients to the clinic, potential future ED
patients from the community are solicited from patients who
register with the clinic. These patients are encouraged by the
clinic staff to ask their medically needy, indigent friends and
neighbors to use the clinic services. Word-of-mouth dissemi-
nation among social networks of clinic users was thought to
be a cost-effective way to preempt avoidable ED use from
the surrounding community. However, upon arrival at the
clinic, the same income criteria were applied to walk-in
patients to identify those who qualified for free services and
sliding-scale fees.
Our primary measures of interest were overall hospital
ED visit volumes contributed by high-users, patient-level
annual visit rates, and mean emergency severity. These mea-
sures were compared pre- versus postintervention. High-
users and occasional users of the preintervention period
were tracked through the postintervention period. The sec-
ondary outcome of interest was postintervention conver-
gence of mean annual visit rates and emergency severity
between returning preintervention high-users and new (pos-
tintervention) high-users. We considered this an important
outcome because the primary care intervention continues to
date, and should preempt nonemergent ED visits by emerg-
ing new high-users from the community. The study was
approved by the hospital Ethics Committee and the univer-
sity's Institutional Review Board.
Study Protocol
We extracted billing data on all ED visits of adults aged 18
years or older during 2 periods. The preintervention period
was August 16, 2009-August 15, 2011, and the postinterven-
tion period, August 16, 2011-August 15, 2014. Data were
organized to group visits by patient (based on name, social
security number [SSN], date of birth [DOB]). To minimize
exclusions due to missing/erroneous identifiers, we linked
ED data to the ED patient registration and inpatient admis-
sion databases using the above as link variables, followed by
manual review to rectify errors/missing data. This step
reduced sample exclusions from 7.6% to 2.7% of visits.
De-identified data were extracted into University of South
Carolina computers for analysis. We excluded patients with a
single ED visit during the 5-year study period if that visit
ended in inpatient admission, implying a clearly appropriate
use of the ED for a true, occasional emergency. The study
intervention did not target such visits, nor was there a subse-
quent visit by these patients to study longitudinal ED use
behavior. These visits constituted similar proportions of the
total ED visit volume, pre- and postintervention, 19.7% ver-
sus 18.3%, respectively (Table 1), suggesting that the study
results may be robust to their exclusion. We studied ED
patients with all payer sources because significant propor-
tions of insured patients in the preintervention period did not
have a primary care provider (22% of Medicare patients,
60% of Medicaid, and 47% of privately insured patients),
and because the intervention targeted the uninsured as well
as insured patients without a PCP. All ED visits of study
patients during the study period were included in the study.
Due to distinct and independent patient registration sys-
tems at the clinic and hospital, there was no way to link clinic
visits with specific ED patients except through matching
name, SSN, and DOB. However, emergency service users are
known to provide inaccurate SSN/DOB. One study reported a
66.6% discrepancy between SSNs documented by emergency
medical service providers versus hospital-recorded SSNs
among acute chest pain patients, compared with a discrep-
ancy rate of 19.7% in the names and 18.3% in DOB for the
same patients.10 Reluctance to provide accurate SSN is widely
thought to be due to patient concerns about billing department
follow-up for dues collection, especially among poor or unin-
sured patients. (Anecdotally, inaccurate SSN or refusal to
provide an SSN was also a frequent experience at this clinic.)
Triangulation of the clinic patient data with the hospital inpa-
tient and ED billing databases to correct SSN/DOB errors (as
done with ED billing data) could not be accomplished.
We defined high-users as patients with 3 or more ED vis-
its in a continuous 12-month period. The state of South
Carolina's Department of Health and Human Services
defines high-users as those making 3 or more visits in a year,
asking hospitals to use this definition to monitor ED utiliza-
tion in an effort to minimize the overall health system cost,
part of which is reimbursed by the State through
Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments. We
found this definition to satisfy the recommendation of the
research literature that high-users being targeted for inter-
ventions should account for at least 25% of total visits to
produce a meaningful impact on ED volumes.11 In the prein-
tervention period, our high-user definition attributed 47.5%
of total ED visits to high-users. Other studies have also used
this definition.12 We identified preintervention high-users as
follows. For patients with an ED visit during the preinter-
vention period, their visits during the year before the calen-
dar start date of the preintervention period (August 16,
2008-August 15, 2009) and year after (August 16,
2011-August 15, 2012) were drawn into a temporary ana-
lytic dataset to flag high-users who would qualify as high-
users based on their visits in the months adjacent to the
calendar duration of the preintervention period. This pre-
empts misclassification bias due to the calendar limits of the
study period. Similarly, to flag new high-users of the pos-
tintervention period, we used visits during August 16,
2010-August 15, 2011 (1 year prior to the calendar postint-
ervention period). However, after identifying high-users of
the 2 periods, visits were used for analysis only if they
occurred in the calendar period of study. Visits that occurred
before the study period were excluded from analysis. Study
period visits were assigned to the pre- or post-period as
applicable. Patients other than high-users were defined as
"occasional users."

We chose to study 2 preintervention years to avoid biased
results from a single, potentially outlier year (eg, preinterven-
tion year). We limited it to 2 years to minimize cohort matura-
tion bias due to disease evolution among comorbid patients.
We selected 3 years for the postintervention period to allow
adequate time for the 2-year cohort of preintervention patients
to visit the ED postintervention, potentially receive a primary
care referral, and then manifest changes in their ED use
behavior. Despite imbalanced pre- and postintervention peri-
ods, we ensure comparable measures by using the average
annual patient visit rate in each period, and averaging the
emergency severity across a patient's visits in each period.
Measures
At the hospital level, we compared preintervention versus
postintervention ED patient volumes, total, high-users, and
occasional users.We define emergency severity as the patient's
discharge emergency severity index (ESI), a calculated mea-
sure that adjusts the nurse-triaged AHRQ ESI score with the

Note. ESI is a calculated discharge ESI in the billing database. The original AHRQ ESI score is the initial triaged status 1-5, higher score indicating lower
severity. In this hospital, the ESI is revised to reflect true emergency and clinical severity by calculating it at discharge, based on final diagnosis, resources
used to treat, and discharge disposition. The documented ESI is also reverse coded (relative to the AHRQ scale) to align with the billing convention,
higher ESI = higher severity. ED = emergency department; ESI = emergency severity index; AHRQ = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
aThese visits by 1-time users admitted as inpatients are excluded from the study, given that the intervention was designed to reduce avoidable ED visits
that are remediable by primary care. These patients had no other ED visit in the study period, were not targeted by the intervention, and not amenable
for study of subsequent behavior.

resources used to treat (total charges), and their discharge
disposition. The calculation is based on an internal hospital
algorithm and uses the AHRQ categories of severity but
reverse coded, so that increasing score represents higher
severity to align with the hospital billing convention (5 =
life-threatening, 4 = emergent, 3 = urgent, 2 = nonurgent, 1 =
fast track).13 A calculated ESI approach (in contrast to initial
nurse-triaged score) is consistent with the prevailing consen-
sus that the initial triaged ESI has poor replicability and pre-
dictive validity for outcomes, largely because subsequent
diagnostic assessments and treatments are highly variable
relative to the initial, symptom-based triage.14
Patient-level mean annual visit rates and mean ESI scores
were aggregated across the total ED population in each
period, grouping patients as high-users and occasional users.
We hypothesized that longitudinally tracked high-users'
annual visit rates would decline following the intervention,
and mean ESI would increase due to fewer low-severity vis-
its. For preintervention high-users, we compared these mea-
sures pre- versus postintervention, both overall, and classified
into quartiles based on mean annual visit frequency.
Preintervention high-users were also compared with preinter-
vention occasional users. Returning high-users were com-
pared with new high-users of the postintervention period.
Finally, we classified preintervention high-users into severity
quartiles based on their preintervention average severity, and
compared each quartile's pre- versus post-mean severity.
We assigned serious comorbidity to the patients if, at any
preintervention visit, their primary or secondary diagnoses
(up to 3) showed one of 10 serious conditions (HIV and the 9
Dartmouth conditions--serious malignant or metastatic can-
cer, chronic pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease,
severe congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease,
severe chronic liver disease, diabetes with end-organ damage,
renal failure, dementia). The Dartmouth comorbidities are
validated predictors of in-hospital mortality and inpatient care
intensity.15 We also identified the presence of ambulatory care
sensitive conditions (ACSCs; 24 conditions, see supplemen-
tary appendix). Because these are chronic conditions, a given
patient was assigned the comorbidity/ACSC to all their visits.
Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4.
Results
Of total 108 717 adult ED visits, 2898 (2.7%) were excluded
due to missing patient identifying information. Figure 1
shows the distribution of 105 819 visits by year and user
type. Overall ED volumes increased over the study period.
After excluding 1-time ED patients whose visit ended in
inpatient admission, the mean annual visit volume was 16
372 preintervention, and 18 496 postintervention. Annual
visit volumes contributed by preintervention high-users
declined in the postintervention period, by 53.8% (P < .001).

postintervention ED patients (the latter including returning
preintervention patients). We present their demographics,

visits), residential proximity (based on zip code at first visit),
serious comorbidity, ACSC, mean ESI, and user type (high-
user/occasional user). Of preintervention patients, 77.4%
were of working age, 56.6% Black, 34.1% were uninsured at
1 or more ED visits, and 25.4% were high-users who
accounted for 47.5% of all preintervention visits. Prevalence
of serious comorbidity was 19% and ACSC, 27.2%, total
with comorbidity, 46.2%. About 43.4% lived in the hospital
zip code or adjacent zip codes. Preintervention, the mean
annual visit rate per patient was 1.91 (±2.37), and mean ESI
score, 3.62 (±0.94). By comparison, fewer postintervention
patients were high-users (22.4%), the mean annual visit rate
was lower, and ESI score was higher (all P < .001). Serious
comorbidity and ACSC rates were similar in the pre- and
postintervention periods.
Table 2 presents the pre- versus postintervention, mean
visit rates and mean ESI scores of preintervention high-users
(Section A) and occasional users (Section B). Each group
was classified into quartiles based on their preintervention
mean annual visit rate. A large number of high-users had a
visit rate equal to the quartile cutoff frequencies; we assigned
all these patients to the quartile below the cutoff point (con-
sistent with the definition of percentile values). The lowest
and top quartile values, preintervention, were 0.94 and 5.43,
respectively (highest value for an individual patient was
27.5). About 41.7% did not visit the ED in the postinterven-
tion period and are excluded from the denominators for pos-
tintervention visit rates and severity calculations. Across
returning high-users, their mean annual visit rate was 7.3%
lower than the mean visit rate of all high-users before the
intervention (1.51 reduced to 1.40). Significant visit rate
reductions postintervention were noted in every quartile
(mean visit rates were 1.11-1.72; and the highest individual
annual visit rate fell to 14.0). We noted a statistically signifi-
cant postintervention increase in the overall mean ESI score
(3.51-3.61), with significant increases noted within each of
the lower 3 quartiles of high-users (P < .001, P = .009, P =
.013, respectively).
Among occasional ED users, the annual visit rate of the
top quartile nearly halved, from a preintervention rate of
1.02 to 0.67 postintervention, P < .001 (Table 2, Section B).
Their mean ESI score increased from 3.54 to 3.66 (P <
.001). The lower 3 quartiles of occasional users had to be
pooled (all these patients had only 1 visit in the preinterven-
tion period). A smaller change in mean severity is observed
in this group (3.69 and 3.73, respectively, P = .039) along
with a slight increase in mean visit rate (0.5 vs 0.6). Overall,
the top quartile and the lower quartiles of occasional users
converged to one common profile in the postintervention
period (0.67 vs 0.6).
Table 3 presents the postintervention period comparison
of new high-users with returning high-users. For new high-
users, the lowest quartile and top quartile values were 0.6
and 3.23 visits, respectively. These values are higher than
the corresponding values for returning high-users (1.11 and
3.21, respectively), but lower than those of preintervention
high-users in the preintervention period (0.94 and 5.43,
respectively). In the postintervention period, visit rates of
new high-users and returning high-users show similarity
among the lower quartiles (0.60 for quartiles 1 and 2 com-
bined vs 1.11 and 1.45 for the first and second quartiles of
returning high-users). The latter's corresponding rates in the
preintervention period were 0.94 and 2.0, respectively. New
high-users' mean ESI scores in the top quartile and lowest
quartile are 3.62 and 3.68, compared with 3.53 and 3.62,
respectively, for returning high-users. Upon reviewing the
preintervention period ESI of high-users (Table 2) against
the postintervention mean ESI of returning high-users and
new high-users (Table 3), all quartiles show higher ESI lev-
els in the postintervention period.
A subgroup analysis was performed of preintervention
high-users of working age 18 to 64 years. They were classi-
fied by insurance status (insured, including private and gov-
ernment sources) and uninsured, and the results are shown in
Supplemental Table 2 in the supplementary materials.
Similar to the main analysis, uninsured high-users tracked
into the postintervention period also showed substantial and
statistically significant reductions in annual visit rates, con-
current with an increase in emergency severity. Insured
working-age high-users showed an increase in emergency
severity but no change in the visit rate. Postintervention, a
convergence of mean visit rates of uninsured and insured
high-user groups is also observed.
We also studied preintervention high-users classified into
quartiles by their mean ESI score in the preintervention
period (table presented in supplemental materials). The low-
est severity quartile showed the highest postintervention
increase in mean ESI, from 2.65 to 3.30, a 24.5% increase.
The mean ESI decreased among the upper quartiles of sever-
ity. Mean ESI of the top quartile (4.66, which is close to the
"life-threatening" score, 5.0) declined to 4.09. The mean ESI
of the next quartile (3.93, almost at the "emergent" level of
4.0) also declined to 3.76. It is notable that the above changes
occurred despite similar rates of serious comorbidity and
ACSCs among the preintervention and postintervention ED
patients (Table 1).
Discussion
Following the primary care access intervention, we observed
a large reduction in ED visit rates of both high-users and
higher end occasional users. The reductions were sustained
even when the analysis was restricted to uninsured working-
age patients, showing substantial changes in visit rates and
severity among uninsured high-users tracked through the pos-
tintervention period, compared with the modest or no change
observed among tracked insured high-users. The visit volume
reductions of the uninsured occurred concurrent with increas-
ing emergency severity of visits. The study intervention con-
sisted of 2 components. First, an active offer of free primary

8 INQUIRY
care access, on-campus, to poor uninsured ED patients, pri-
oritizing ED high-users and chronic disease patients, supple-
mented by 24/7 phone access to primary care doctors, was
provided. For insured patients who were high-users or chronic
disease patients, an educational conversation on the impor-
tance of regularly using a primary care doctor was provided at
a "teachable moment," when the patient has just survived a
scary, possibly life-threatening episode. Given the broad
scope of the intervention, this evaluation study included ED
patients with all types of payers: Medicare, Medicaid, private
insurance, and the uninsured. Medicare beneficiaries are doc-
umented to have a usual source of care (>95%).16 However,
26% to 35% of beneficiaries use a specialist as their usual
source of care, and they are more likely to be the highest-cost
beneficiaries, compared with PCP users.16 In this study, 22%
of Medicare ED patients, 60% of Medicaid, and 47% of pri-
vately insured patients did not have a primary care provider as
reported at their first ED visit.
While 41.7% of high-users did not return to the ED pos-
tintervention, among returning high-users, there were dra-
matic reductions in the annual visit frequency within every
quartile (by 28%-68%). The 3-year duration of the postinter-
vention period provided adequate time for the primary care
intervention to be availed as and when a patient returned to
the ED, and for patients to manifest a change in their ED use
patterns. This may mitigate the likelihood of spurious find-
ings due to chance. A definitive, intervention impact is sup-
ported by the concurrent increase in the discharge ESI,
averaged over this large high-user cohort. Furthermore, the
differentiation of severity changes between patient quartiles
classified on severity is notable--a dramatic increase in ESI
among the lowest severity patients, and clinically salient
severity reductions among the emergent and life-threatening
severity quartiles to lower severity levels (see supplemental
materials). (The opposite directions of effect among the low-
and high-severity quartiles explain the modest (0.10) increase
in average severity across all high-users, shown in Table 2.) A
note of caution, however, is appropriate. The ESI scale as
computed by this hospital is not empirically validated for pre-
dictive accuracy. The original AHRQ ESI scale was designed
to capture initial, nurse-triaged severity of a patient before
diagnostic investigations are done to finalize the diagnoses
and treatment needs, and is therefore, more a measure of
symptomatic emergent severity rather than true disease state
emergent severity. At this hospital, the concern regarding the
severity validity of the original AHRQ ESI is mitigated
because the ESI is calculated with an algorithm that uses

initial triage, resources used to treat patient outcome.
Intuitively, this method is superior to the AHRQ ESI scale,
because it captures the true emergent status of the patient by
differentiating symptom-driven emergencies versus

life-threatening conditions. However, the hospital's algorithm
is proprietary (used across hospitals owned by the parent

missionary group), not validated by empirical research.
A true primary care impact would be best verified by
identifying ED patients who visited the free clinic and those
who acquired an office-based PCP to study their ED use
changes. The former proved logistically impossible due to
unlinkable clinic IT and hospital EMR systems. No data are
available to quantify the latter. The free clinic registered
5701 visits over 3 years, made by 741 patients, mostly unin-
sured patients.
The decline in preintervention high-users'visit rates could
be argued as a secular, natural regression from sporadic high
ED use caused by transient medical exacerbations. With sta-
bilization of their medical condition, these patients should
regress to the mean pattern of the local population. Two find-
ings mitigate this explanation. First, if the historic high-
users'visit reductions were due to this effect, new high-users
should repeat the historic visit rates and severity levels of the
preintervention period, which is not the case. On the con-
trary, their visit rates are much lower than the historic rates of

preintervention high-users in the preintervention period.
Notably in the postintervention period, new high-users and
returning high-users show convergence of both visit rates
and ESI levels among the lower quartiles of visit frequency.
Serious comorbidity and ACSC prevalence rates were simi-
lar among the pre- and postintervention groups of ED patients
(Table 1). Collectively, the findings suggest that more
patients may have used primary care, resulting in less need
for ED visits, and when they used the ED, it was more appro-
priate, for emergent needs. Also supporting an intervention
effect is the similar direction of change, although of lower
magnitude among higher-end occasional users. The top quar-
tile of occasional users (containing a large number of patients
who fell short of the 3-visits-in-12-months criterion) showed
large postintervention changes (a 75% decrease in visit fre-
quency), and an increase in mean ESI score to similar levels
as those of the lower quartiles of returning high-users.
The pattern of visit rate declines among high-users is rein-
forced by the observed longitudinal changes in visit ESI
among patients of different severity levels. When preinter-
vention high-users were classified on emergency severity,
the lowest severity quartile, accounting for the largest frac-
tion of preintervention high-users (39.1%), showed a 25%
ESI increase in their postintervention visits. Concurrently,
the higher severity patients (with emergent and life-threaten-
ing range of ESI) showed ESI reductions toward less life-
threatening levels. The combination of visit rates and ESI
changes in these longitudinally tracked patients supports a
primary care impact. Potentially, the observed increase in
ESI could be argued as a manifestation of disease evolution
of chronically comorbid patients. If such was the case, one
would expect a concurrent increase in the visit rate.
Advancing chronic disease should cause more ED visits (for
various complications) and more severe visits. On the con-
trary, we find a much-reduced visit rate by the same high-
users, postintervention, concurrent with increased severity
among the lower ESI quartiles, and reduced severity among
the highest ESI quartiles.
The postintervention increase of emergency severity
among low-severity patients and a decrease among high-
severity patients validate the normative expectations from
this primary care intervention. Primary care is the first level
of contact with the health care system. The study hospital's
intervention was carefully crafted and executed to ensure a
primary care medical home environment, continuity of pro-
viders (who were full-time and salaried), collaborative
chronic disease management activities, care coordination,
almost free access to accessory care needs such as specialist
care, diagnostic and imaging services, and prescription
drugs. This approach would be expected to help patients to
mitigate or eliminate acute exacerbations through proactive
chronic disease management, and may have helped patients
to substitute ED use with primary care office visits for some
low-severity episodes. Among patients with emergent and
life-threatening severity preintervention, primary care may
have reduced the likelihood and severity of complications of
their chronic disease, or provided a medical home for early
treatment of exacerbations before the condition became
emergent. The collective internal consistency of findings
across multiple subgroups of this ED population mitigates
some of the methodological limitations, which, however,
cannot be ruled out as potential explanatory factors. One
methodological limitation of the study is the group-level
analysis. However, individual, subject-based analysis
requires accounting for medical diagnoses, which in turn
requires a consolidation schema to group disparate diagnoses
into a usable medical status variable for statistical analysis.
Such an effort is beyond the scope of this study. Second, we
are unable to identify ED patients who used the clinic. Up to
67% of SSNs in emergency service system databases may be
inaccurate.10 Anecdotal experiences at the study clinic con-
firm this issue.
Another major limitation is the absence of data on patient
visits to other EDs in the area. The presence of 2 hospitals in
the region (3 and 8 miles away, respectively) may give pause
about offsetting visits to those hospital EDs that may partly
account for the volume reduction at this ED. Both hospitals
pose significant logistic deterrents to neighborhood patients.
The teaching hospital ED had a community-wide reputation
for very long waiting times for all but life-threatening and
emergent patients. The second ED, located in an adjacent
county, is quite distant from the study hospital's patient
source neighborhoods, a key factor in a city with limited
public transportation, with no buses operating in the direc-
tion of the second hospital. Furthermore, the study hospital
and its ED are focused on specialized services such as mater-
nity and pediatrics, services that are not targeted by the study
hospital. Countering the expected natural response of high-
users to disperse their ED visits across hospitals, is the reli-
gious mission of the study hospital, which translated into
management's expectation that hospital staff adhere to the
key creed, including an accepting attitude toward the indi-
gent. The hospital's hinterland is a low-income, minority-
dominated neighborhood with poor transportation options.
Therefore, it is likely that this study limitation is mitigated by
the above factors.
The study overcomes several limitations of previous
studies that showed disparate findings. Some cross-sec-
tional studies and patient surveys showed that primary care
access was associated with fewer ED visits, while others
show the opposite. Supportive evidence largely consisted
of cross-sectional, population-based survey data, compar-
ing self-reported ED use by respondents with and without
primary care access, or comparing the self-reported pri-
mary care access of persons reporting ED use versus non-
use.17-22 Other cross-sectional studies report higher ED use
by persons having a primary care provider.23-26 Notably,
these studies do not account for medically substantiated
emergency severity. In the current study, our measure of
discharge ESI (based on staff-triaged severity, resources
10 INQUIRY
used to treat, and final discharge disposition) represents
medically robust severity and urgency representation, com-
pared with patient-perceived need for ED care that is cap-
tured in cross-sectional surveys.
One cross-sectional study examined the likelihood of
low-emergency visits to the ED by patients enrolled at one
of 4 free-standing free clinics versus unenrolled ED
patients at 4 hospitals in Virginia. The study reported
reduced likelihood of a low-emergency visit by free clinic
users, but no difference in the likelihood of an avoidable,
primary care­amenable visit.20 Acknowledged study limi-
tations were the cross-sectional nature of the study, lack of
information on the composition of each free clinic's ser-
vices, nature and continuity of medical providers, pro-
cesses (if any) for care continuity, care coordination and
chronic disease self-management (the essential elements
of primary care), and the presence of a primary care medi-
cal home environment. As acknowledged in the paper,
most free clinics depend on an uncertain roster of volun-
teer physicians based on availability of spare time. As
such, it is difficult to expect that avoidable ED visits (that
are primary care­amenable and preventable) would be
reduced by the typical free clinic. Possibly due to this
issue, the study showed no association of free clinic enroll-
ment with avoidable visits. Their study also did not exam-
ine associations with ED visit volumes of the study
patients. ED visit volumes are a critical issue for hospitals.
As such, the significance of findings for policy-making
remains limited.
Our study addresses several limitations of the above
study, notably, (1) offering a longitudinal study of the ED
population; (2) tracking individual patients' ED use pat-
terns before and after implementation of the intervention to
examine utilization changes by user type; (3) studying a
hospital-funded, on-campus primary care clinic which
ensured prompt patient acceptance into primary care; (4) a
clinic with a systematic approach to care continuity and
care coordination implemented by salaried medical and
ancillary providers offering dependable provider availabil-
ity; and (5) a systematized approach to facilitate real access
to ancillary medical services (pharmaceuticals, laboratory,
and imaging services) that are critical to make a primary
care intervention meaningful for the goal of reducing avoid-
able medical care.
Longitudinal cohort studies are critical to study ED use
changes within nested subgroups. Crude, before-after vol-
ume comparisons are deceptive, due to the complex and
dynamic composition of the ED population. High-users of
a given year may remain high-users, or become low-users/
nonusers due to complex reasons: health status changes (eg,
chronic disease deterioration, resolution of acute exacerba-
tions, new complications, death), insurance changes,
acquiring a PCP, and patient preferences (eg, convenience
of a snap visit to the ED vs scheduling an office visit).
These dynamics of returning high-users are constantly
being churned by new high-users from the community who
will cycle through these processes. Secondary data sources
(eg, the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP)
nation-wide hospital discharge database) cannot accommo-
date patient tracking beyond a calendar year. Moreover,
missing or misreported SSN and DOB (reportedly more
likely by high-users) result in significant patient exclusions
in HCUP data­driven studies. Triangulation of claims data
with internal hospital databases is critical; our sample
exclusions were reduced from 7.6% to 2.7% by such
triangulation.
Few longitudinal interventional studies are docu-
mented. A 42-hospital collaborative used process reengi-
neering to reduce ED waiting times, but it did not target
the medical care content.27 In another study, ED staff
referred 965 consenting, nonemergent ED patients with-
out a personal physician to the in-hospital primary care
clinic. Of them, 50% visited the clinic versus 39% of con-
trol patients, with no subsequent difference in ED use.28
Indigent ED patients who were generically referred to
local safety-net clinics showed no change in their ED visit
rates.29 Reduced ED use was reported when uninsured
patients were provided an insurance plan requiring adher-
ence to one PCP.30 Patients of primary care practices
transformed into primary care medical homes used the ED
less than comparison practice patients.31 Overall, the evi-
dence supports that a definitive assumption of primary
care responsibility by an entity offering dependable clinic
hours, and implementing key primary care principles may
be the key to success.
In addition to the limitations noted earlier, other limita-
tions include retrospective, single-hospital study, lack of data
on after-hours teleconsultations, and not accounting for 2
issues: the 2008-2009 economic recession and disease matu-
ration. Bias due to the economic recession is partly mitigated
by similar time trends of the study hospital's ED volumes to
those of South Carolina and the neighboring states.32,33 One
unmeasured source of bias remains: policy changes at the
national, state, or local level.
Disease maturation and new comorbidities that arose pos-
tintervention may underestimate the primary care impact,
because they would necessitate more, not less ED visits. We
observe a significant decline in visit rates. Our study, there-
fore, potentially underestimates the visit rate reduction
attributable to the primary care intervention. Generalizability
to other hospitals may be a concern, although mitigated by
the study hospital's similarity to the typical, urban hospital
on many indicators: ED patient-to-visit ratio of 1:1.6 (1:1.9
among nonteaching hospitals, and 1:1.6 at a teaching
hospital20,34); 19% of adult ED visits ending in inpatient
admission (14.7% nationally for adult and pediatric visits
combined3); 34% uninsured (31.7% in another study35,36).
Overall, the study findings support proactive, well-organized
primary care interventions as a strategy to reduce avoidable
ED visits.
