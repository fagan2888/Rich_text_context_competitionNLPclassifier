Adult Prescription Drug Use and Pediatric Medication
Exposures and Poisonings
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Medication ingestions are
increasing among children despite a number of public health
interventions. The majority of these poisonings are related to
prescription as opposed to over-the-counter medications.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Rising rates of poisonings in children are
strongly correlated with rising use of hypoglycemics,
antihyperlipidemics, b-blockers, and opioids among adults. These
events are associated with considerable health care utilization, both
in terms of emergency department visits and hospital admissions.
abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Nontherapeutic medication inges-
tions continue to be a major pediatric health problem, with recent
increases in ingestions despite a number of public health interven-
tions. It is unknown how changes in adult prescription drug use relate
to pediatric medication poisonings. The objective of the study was to
measure the association between changing adult prescription drug
patterns and pediatric medication exposures and poisonings and
identify high-risk classes of medications and pediatric age groups.
METHODS: We measured monthly pediatric exposures and poisonings
using the National Poison Data System and prescriptions written for
adults using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys for 2000
through 2009. Associations between adult prescriptions for oral hypo-
glycemics, antihyperlipidemics, b-blockers, and opioids and expo-
sures and poisonings among children 0 to 5, 6 to 12, and 13 to 19
years were analyzed by using multiple time-series analysis.
Emergency department visits, serious injuries, and hospitalizations
stemming from these associations were described.
RESULTS: Adult medication prescriptions were statistically significantly as-
sociated with exposures and poisonings in children of all ages, with the
strongest association observed for opioids. Across medications, the great-
est risk was among children 0 to 5 years old, followed by 13- to 19-year-olds.
Rates of emergency department visits were highest for events related to
hypoglycemics (60.1%) and b-blockers (59.7%), whereas serious injuries
and hospitalizations occurred most frequently with opioids (26.8% and
35.2%, respectively) and hypoglycemics (19.5% and 49.4%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing adult drug prescriptions are strongly asso-
ciated with rising pediatric exposures and poisonings, particularly for
opioids and among children 0 to 5 years old. These associations have
sizable impacts, including high rates of serious injury and health care
use. Pediatrics 2013;132:18­27

Despite a number of public health
interventions over the past 40 years,
poisonings from prescription medi-
cations continue to be a major cause
of morbidity among children.1­5 Inter-
ventions have included educational
campaigns on safe medication storage
and the introduction of child-resistant
closures on adult prescription medi-
cation bottles. Although these mea-
sures are credited in part with reducing
overall deaths from medication poi-
soning in children, visits to emergency
departments (EDs) for medication ex-
posures are increasing.6 More than
70 000 children are evaluated in EDs for
unintentional medication exposures
and poisonings each year.6,7 Of children
presenting to EDs, at least 12% are
hospitalized.7,8 Exposures and poison-
ings are most frequently linked to
prescription medications compared
with over-the-counter medications,
with children aged #5 years at par-
ticularly high risk and comprising the
majority of calls received by US Poison
Centers.9,10 Many exposures among
younger children occur in the child's
own home, with medications often be-
longing to an adult relative.11
After a brief decline in the 1990s, the
number of medication exposures and
poisonings is again increasing among
children.7,12 Between 2001 and 2008,
rates of pediatric ED visits and hospi-
talizations resulting from medication
exposures and poisonings increased
by 30% and 36%, respectively.7 At the
same time, adult prescription rates
are increasing.13 However, population
changes in adult medication prescrip-
tions have not been linked with pop-
ulation changes in pediatric exposures
and poisonings. We aimed to esti-
mate the association of drug pre-
scriptions in adults with patterns of
exposures and poisonings in children,
and any subsequent health care utili-
zation and morbidity. In addition, we
aimed to identify high-risk classes of
medications and pediatric age groups
by measuring drug- and age-specific
associations.
METHODS
Study Design
We analyzed exposures and poison-
ings reported to US Poison Centers
from 2000 through 2009 for the medi-
cations most commonly prescribed to
adults. Thesewere analgesics(11.4% of
all prescriptions), antihyperlipidemics
(6.2% of all prescriptions), antide-
pressants (4.5% of all prescriptions),
antidiabetic agents (4.2% of all pre-
scriptions), and b-blockers (4% of all
prescriptions).13,14 Antidepressants
were excluded to focus on drugs that
are primarily prescribed in adults to
avoid events related to therapeutic
use in children. Analgesics were also
limited to opioids to exclude over-the-
counter medications (eg, acetamino-
phen). Finally, we limited our analysis
to single-ingredient medications and
excluded nonoral medications (eg, in-
sulin). The study was deemed exempt
from review by the Institutional Review
Board at Boston Children's Hospital.
Pediatric Exposures and
Poisonings
Data on pediatric exposures and
poisonings were obtained from the
American Association of Poison Con-
trol Centers' National Poison Data
System (NPDS). NPDS is a comprehen-
sive data repository with information
on calls to all 57 US Poison Centers.
Detailed information is recorded for
every exposure or poisoning, includ-
ing patient demographics, names of
implicated medications, and specifics
surrounding the circumstances of the
ingestion. Case follow-up is performed
to obtain additional information on
clinical effects, healthcare require-
ments, and medical outcome. All NPDS
reports for January 1, 2000, through
December 31, 2009 were analyzed for
medication implicated, clinical effects,
and associated ED use or hospitaliza-
tion among children 0 to 5, 6 to 12, and
13 to 19 years old. Cases were ex-
cluded if the description of the expo-
sure or poisoning indicated that the
event was related to a pediatric pre-
scription, such as a parent making a
dosing error or giving medication doses
too closely together.
Adult Drug Prescriptions
Adult drug prescriptions were mea-
sured using the National Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey,15 an annual na-
tional survey of patient visits to US
non­federally employed outpatient
medical providers conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics.
Physician offices are randomly chosen
for participation and are trained by
National Center for Health Statistics
staff on survey completion. Patient visits
are randomly chosen in 1-week report-
ing periods to provide representative
visits throughout the year. Data col-
lected include patient demographics,
details of the clinical presentation, and
care provided, including drug therapy.
Physicians record up to 8 administered
medications (only 6 for the years 2000­
2002) that were prescribed or con-
tinued at the time of the visit. These
"drug mentions" provide a representa-
tive view of US medication use.14,16,17 We
identified alldrug mentions for the drug
classes of interest between January 1,
2000, and December 31, 2009, among
patients aged $20 years. Using the
unique drug codes, we excluded
combination medications and nono-
ral formulations to match the drugs
implicated in exposures and poison-
ings among children.
Health Care Utilization and
Morbidity Related to Exposures
Health care utilization is recorded in

treated and released, admitted to a
noncritical care unit, admitted to a
critical care unit, admitted to a psychi-
atric facility, failed to arrive at a health
care facility despite referral, and lost
to follow-up.1 For our analysis, we
combined admissions to noncritical
care and critical care units and con-
sidered failure to arrive at a health
care facility as lost to follow-up.
Morbidity related to medication expo-
sures and poisonings was measured
using the NPDS medical outcome cat-
egories. We combined "moderate ef-
fect" (more prolonged or serious
symptoms that require clinical atten-
tion), "major effect" (life-threatening
signs or symptoms or a residual dis-
ability resulting from the exposure),
and death (fatality that was a direct
result of the medication exposure) and
considered these outcomes as serious
injuries.7
Statistical Analysis
The mean monthly number of expo-
sures and poisonings related to the 4
drug classes of interest was calculated
for each of the pediatric age groups.
Similarly, the mean monthly number of
drug mentions among adults was
measured for medications in these
drug classes. Both the number of pe-
diatric poisonings and of adult drug
mentions were normalized using US
Census estimates to prevent con-
founding of the results by changes in
population composition over the study
period.18
Associations
Trends in pediatric exposures and
poisonings were described by using
multiple time-series analysis.19 In
principle, the statistical analysis in-
volved the specification of time-series
models where exposures and poison-
ings at any given month (t) were
a function of the previous months'adult
mentions of 1 of the 4 adult studied
medications (t ­ i) after adjusting for
seasonality (exposure and poisoning
trends may vary similarly year to
year and month to month) and auto-
correlation (measurements occurring
closer in time are more similar than
those farther apart in time). Monthly
dummy indicators were included as
covariates to adjust for potential bia-
ses related to seasonality. This method
is assumption-free, allowing season-
ality to follow nonlinear patterns.20
Newey-West standard errors were
used so the error variance estimates
would be valid under autocorrelation
violation of regression assumptions,
yielding conservative estimates of the
confidence intervals regardless of any
specific model adjustment.21,22 This
analysis strategy produced valid esti-
mates insensitive to possible seasonal
and autocorrelational confounding.
Causality
The causal significance of associations
were judged by using a Granger cau-
sality model in which trends from the
previous 1 to 6 months for adult med-
ication mentions were used to predict
exposure or poisonings after control-
ling for trends in exposure and poi-
soningsfromtheprevious1to6months

). A statistically significant result
for the combination of adult mention
coefficients using a Wald test is inter-
preted to mean that adult mentions is
a "Granger cause of" exposure or poi-
soning.22­24 This allowed us to make
robust inferences regarding the sig-
nificance of any association.
RESULTS
There were 38 485 pediatric exposures
and poisonings to oral hypoglycemics,
39 693 to antihyperlipidemics, 49 075 to
b-blockers, and 62 416 to opioids over
the 10-year study period. The mean
yearly numbers of exposures and poi-
sonings for each of the age groups
and medication classes are shown
in Table 1. Children 0 to 5 years of
age experienced the greatest mean
number of events per year for each of
the 4 drug classes.
Figure 1 displays time trends for pedi-
atric exposures and poisonings by
each of the 3 age groups. Population-
adjusted pediatric medication exposures
and poisonings increased statistically
significantly for all the drug classes
among all age groups over the study
period, based on a linear trend (P ,
.001). These increases varied sub-
stantially across age groups and drug
classes. Among children 0 to 5 years
old, opioid exposures and poisonings
increased 0.09 (95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 0.07­0.11) per 1 000 000 chil-
dren each month, compared with 0.006
(95% CI, 0.004­0.008) among 6- to 12-
year-olds, and 0.04 (95% CI, 0.04­0.05)
among 13- to 19-year-olds. Increases
were generally larger among children
0 to 5 years of age for all drugs. Among
0- to 5-year-olds, hypoglycemic expo-
sures and poisonings increased 0.04
(95% CI, 0.04­0.05), antihyperlipidemics
increased 0.10 (95% CI, 0.08­0.11), and
b-blockers increased 0.08 (95% CI,

There were significant associations
between adult medication use and
exposures and poisonings in children
averaging across projected increases
1 to 6 months into the future. These
associations were generally twice as

sonings per 1 000 000 children among
0- to 5-, 6- to 12-, and 13- to 19-year-

mic adult mentions were associated
with a 0.35 (95% CI, 0.27­0.43), 0.02

ated with a 0.35 (95% CI, 0.28­0.42),
0.02 (95% CI, 0.01­0.02) and 0.01 (95%

was followed by larger increases in
child exposures and poisonings in the
next immediate month than 2 to 6
months later. This pattern was most
evident among children 0 to 5 years old
where exposures and poisonings in-
creased 0.49 (95% CI 0.20­0.78), 0.46
(95% CI 0.27­0.65), 0.68 (95% CI 0.44­
0.93), and 1.86 (95% CI 0.93­2.79) per
1 000 000 children for hypoglycemics,
antihyperlipidemics, b-blockers, and
opioids, respectively. On the basis of
2011 population estimates, this trans-
lates into an additional 11.2 hypogly-
cemic, 10.5 antihyperlipidemic, 15.6
b-blocker, and 42.6 opioid exposures
and poisonings.
Granger causality analysis suggested
adult medication mentions were a
Granger cause of child exposures
and poisonings for 7 of the 12 com-
binations of medication and pediatric
age group. For instance, adult opioid
mentions were a Granger cause of
child exposures and poisonings for
all age groups (0­5 years: F = 2.20,
P , .05; 6­12 years: F = 6.42; P ,
.001; 13­19 years: F = 4.31, P , .001).
Among children 0 to 5 years, adult
mentions of all medications were
Granger causes of increased expo-
sures and poisonings for the same
medication (P , .05). Opioids and
antihyperlipidemic adult mentions
were also Granger causes of in-
creased exposures and poisonings
among children 6 to 12 years old
(P , .05). Only opioid adult mentions
were Granger causes of increased
exposure or poisoning among chil-
dren 13 to 19 years old. These results
suggest that the associations de-
scribed in Fig 2 are indicative of a
causal relationship in 7 cases.

Health Care Utilization and
Morbidity Related to Pediatric
Exposures and Poisonings
A total of 92 715 (61.3%) exposures and
poisonings resulted in an ED evalua-
tion. Hypoglycemics and b-blockers
were associated with the highest rates
of ED visits, 60.3% (n = 23 205) and
59.6% (n = 29 233) of exposures and
poisonings, respectively (Table 2). Visit
rates for opioids were 46.4% (n = 30
277) and for antihyperlipidemics 25.3%
(n = 10 050). Children 0 to 5 years old
experienced the highest rates of visits
for exposures and poisonings related
to b-blockers (62.7%) and hypo-
glycemics (61.2%). Among children 13
to 19 years old, the majority of expo-
sures and poisonings resulted in an ED
visit for every drug class.
Among children of all ages, serious
injuries were associated with 17.5%
(n= 16 196)of exposuresand poisonings
evaluated and treated in EDs. Approxi-
mately 19.5% (n = 4518) of exposures
to hypoglycemics, 8.8% (n = 885) of
exposures to antihyperlipidemics, 9.8%
(n = 2857) of exposures to b-blockers,
and 26.3% (n = 7966) of exposures
to opioids resulted in serious injury
(Table 3). For each of the drug classes,
children experienced increasing rates of
serious injury with increasing age.
Among patients 13 to 19 years old, rates
of injuries ranged from 29.5% for events
related to antihyperlipidemics to 40.5%
for those resulting from opioids. Opioid
exposures were the most likely to suffer
a serious clinical effect and were also

unit.
Over a third of all pediatric exposures
and poisoning patients evaluated in
the ED were hospitalized (35.7%; n = 33
059). Admission rates were highest
among patients ingesting hypoglycemics
(49.4%) and opioids (35.0%).
DISCUSSION
Increasing rates of adult drug pre-
scriptions are strongly associated with
increases in drug exposures and poi-
sonings among children and appear to
be a direct cause of exposures and
poisonings. Exposures to opioids are
most closely related to trends in adult
use, and children aged 0 to 5 years old
areatgreatestriskforexposureamong
all4adultdrugclassesstudied.Thereis
substantial health care utilization and
morbidity associated with these events
among children of all ages,
The Poisoning Prevention Packaging
Act of 1970 mandated the use of child-
resistant packaging for prescription
medications and is credited with mak-
ing pediatric fatalities from medication
exposures and poisonings relatively
uncommon in the United States.6,25,26
The 2008 Preventing Overdoses and
Treatment Exposures Task Force has
further promoted the development of a
new generation of safety packaging.6,27
Our work suggests that even though
these programs may be effective, child
exposures and poisonings continue to
be a significant and increasing prob-
lem, and interventions need to take into
account the increases in adult pre-
scriptions available to children. Pedia-
tricians should consult parents of
patients on storing medications, fo-
cusing on how exposures vary based

on the child's age and intention. Physi-
cians prescribing drugs to adults
should also be aware of the potential
risk of exposures to children and pro-
vide guidance accordingly. Finally, cer-
tain drugs may require additional
packaging modification. For example,
in 2012, the manufacturers of Sub-
oxone, in response to an analysis from
the US Poison Centers, announced that
they would voluntarily discontinue the
supply of Suboxone tablets and sell
only unit-dose packaged Suboxone
film.28
Increased adult prescription medica-
tion availability is likely to persist. The
NHANES found that between 1999­2000
and 2007­2008, the percentage of
US adults who took $1 prescription
drug in the preceding month increased
by 10%.14 Moreover, the rising rate
of obesity in the United States sug-
gests increases in pediatric exposure
and poisonings will continue because
prescriptions for antihyperlipidemics,
oral hypoglycemics, and b-blockers
are all commonly used to treat obesity-
related complications.29­31 Rates of
polypharmacy are also on the rise.14
Without greater emphasis on interven-
tions focusing on the changed context
of increased availability of prescrip-
tion drugs in households, the number
of medication exposures and poison-
ings in children will likely continue to
increase.
The observed differences in medication
exposures and poisonings across age
groups may be related to age-specific
behaviors that lead to these events.1,13
Among younger children, poisonings
tend to be related to exploratory be-
havior and result in unintentional
exposures to a medication.1 Children
aged #5 years are most susceptible to
this type of ingestion and experience
higher rates of exposures and poison-
ings. Among teenagers, ingestions are
more likely to be intentional, including
for recreational purposes or with the
intention of self-harm.1,32 As a result, the
morbidity and health care utilization
(including psychiatric admissions, as
our findings demonstrate) are higher in
this older patient population.1,13
Opioid exposures far exceeded events
related to the other drug classes
among teenagers. This class of drugs
differs from the others in its potential
for abuse. Opioid diversion is a well-
recognized public health problem
among adults and has also been iden-
tified among teenagers.33­37 Drug over-
dose death rates have more than
tripled in the United States since 1990,
with .75% of these deaths attribut-
able to opioids.36 The rise in deaths and
health care use related to opioid di-
version has been paralleled by a 300%
increase in the sales of opioids since
1999.36 Our findings support the need
for further research to delineate the
factors surrounding adolescent access
to and abuse of these drugs.

Oneofthelimitationsofourstudyisthat
NPDS relies in part on patient-reported
information, and we could not consis-
tently determine the amount of drug
that was ingested. However, the health
care facility utilization and medical
outcome data provide a measure of the
extent of serious ingestions. Because
we limited ourdata to single-ingredient
medications, we were unable to include
certain combination medications (eg,
acetaminophen-hydrocodone), result-
ing in potential underestimation of the
number of exposures and poisonings
for thedrugclassesofinterest.Itisalso
possible that some patients ingested
.1 medication, and we were unable to
ascertain whether the clinical effects
experienced were related solely to
the medications of interest. In addi-
tion, it is important to note that re-
porting to Poison Control Centers is
voluntary, and physicians may be more
likely to report exposures related to
certain medications. Poison center
data therefore provide an approxima-
tion of real-work poisoning epidemiol-
ogy and are subject to underestimates
of certain types of exposures. Finally,
additional information on the circum-
stances surrounding ingestions is not
available in NPDS, and additional in-
formation describing whose medica-
tion was taken, why it was prescribed,
and the person's relationship to the
exposed child would be particularly
useful in developing future safety
interventions.
CONCLUSIONS
The rising use of opioids, anti-
hyperlipidemics, oral hypoglycemics,
and b-blockers among adults is asso-
ciated with a corresponding rise in
exposures and poisonings related to
these drugs in children. These events
are associated with considerable health
care utilization, both in terms of ED
visits and hospital admissions. Our
findings support the need to strengthen
intervention efforts around prescrip-
tion drug ingestions and to develop
prevention strategies that are both
age- and medication-specific.

GRADE INFLATION IS NOT JUST FOR STUDENTS BUT TEACHERS TOO: For years
educators have complained about grade inflation in schools. Whether in high
school, college, or graduate school, the percentage of students awarded the
highest grades continues to climb and the percentage of students awarded the
lowest grades is quite low. Interestingly, the same might be said for the grades of
the educators themselves. As reported in The New York Times (March 31, 2013), in
some states 97% or more of public school teachers are rated effective or highly
effective, and in some counties, 100% of teachers meet these standards. The
surfeit of high marks for teachers isworrisome given how much time, money, and
effort has recently been put into developing new teacher evaluation systems in
the hope that the best teachers are rewarded, and the worst teachers either
remediated or removed from their positions. Teacher evaluations now consist of
two roughly equally weighted components: markers of student progress such as
student test scores, and observation by a principal or other educator, using an
observation scale that may include 60 specific elements. In several states, two
consecutive low scores are grounds for automatic dismissal. Inflated scores may
be in part due to the reluctance of observers to give poor grades, very low
thresholds for each standard, and changes in student testing. School districts
compare reported teacher evaluations and will sometimes retroactively lower
the threshold used to meet a standard in their district to bring their results more
in line with the exemplary results reported in other school districts. Although my
students seem quite adept at giving me remarkably pointed (and insightful)
feedback on my teaching, clearly, nationally a bit more work needs to be done to
safely, effectively, and reliably identify teachers needing remediation.
