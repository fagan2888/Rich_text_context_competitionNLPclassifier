The authors evaluated underascertainment bias in Hispanic mortality rates from population surveys linked to
the US National Death Index (NDI). They compared vital status through 7 years ascertained from an NDI search
and from active follow-up for 2,886 Mexican-American subjects, aged 65 years at baseline in 1993­1994, from
the Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE). Estimates of NDI
underascertainment were applied to mortality rate ratios for 66,667 older Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic
Whites from the 1986­1994 National Health Interview Surveys linked to the NDI. The NDI and active follow-up
agreed on vital status for 91.2% of Hispanic EPESE subjects. The NDI did not identify 177 deaths (20.7%) reported
by proxies. Underascertainment was greater for women and when stratified by age and nativity. The ratios of proxy-
reported to NDI mortality rates were 1.31 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06, 1.62) for immigrant men and 1.65
(95% CI: 1.32, 2.08) for immigrant women. Before adjustment, National Health Interview Surveys­NDI age-
standardized mortality rate ratios comparing Mexican Americans with non-Hispanic Whites were 0.77 (95% CI:
0.65, 0.92) for men and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.09) for women but were 0.84 and 1.18, respectively, with adjustment
for underascertainment. Findings suggest that NDI-based Hispanic mortality rates may be understated.

Since the middle 1980s, epidemiologists who study popu-
lation health disparities have noted an apparent epidemio-
logic paradox. The Hispanic population in the United States
has an average socioeconomic status comparable to that of
African Americans but has age-adjusted mortality rates more
similar to those for non-Hispanic Whites (1­4). This
mortality advantage is commonly considered a paradox both
because socioeconomic standing is a well-established deter-
minant of mortality and because Hispanics (primarily
Mexican Americans) have an elevated prevalence of several
risk factors for mortality, including diabetes and obesity (5­
9).
Several substantive explanations for the Hispanic
mortality advantage in the United States have been
proposed, including health-selective immigration, return
migration, and advantages in health-related behaviors and
social support (10­14). However, before accepting such
substantive explanations for the Hispanic mortality advan-

tage, it is important to explore whether systematic data errors
create the appearance of a mortality advantage. Two kinds of
evidence exist for a Hispanic mortality advantage compared
with other groups: 1) mortality rates calculated by linking
vital registration death data to census population counts and
2) mortality rates calculated from cohort studies in which
mortality is ascertained over a follow-up period. Both kinds
of evidence are subject to data errors that might lead to
misstatement of a Hispanic mortality advantage.
Mortality rates calculated by linking death counts from
vital registration to population counts from census enumera-
tions are subject to error because the numerator and denomi-
nator come from different sources. Both data systems are
subject to coverage errors (i.e., incomplete enumeration and
death registration), discrepancies in ethnic classification, and
age misstatement. Each of these errors can produce system-
atic biases in the calculation of death rates that could create
a false appearance of ethnic disparities (15).
Hispanics, like other minority populations, are dispropor-
tionately exposed to several risk factors for both underregis-
tration of deaths and underenumeration in a census. These
factors include low levels of formal schooling and English
language literacy; residency in poor, rural, and near-border
environments; overrepresentation in agricultural and
domestic service occupations; and undocumented immigra-
tion status. It is not clear a priori whether the undercount
error will be larger in the numerator (deaths) or the denomi-
nator (census). However, one particular concern is that
health-selective return migration of international immigrants
to a country of origin may lead to underestimation of
mortality rates in the United States by systematically
removing report of deaths from the numerator but not the
denominator of mortality calculations (10, 13, 14, 16). This
possibility has been called the "salmon bias" hypothesis
(12). Another especially important concern is that Hispanic
ethnicity may be systematically underreported in death
registration compared with census data. This underreporting
may occur in particular because the ethnicity field on the
death certificate is sometimes filled out by a physician or
funeral director who may not know the decedent well (15,
17).In addition, overstatement of age on the death certificate
lowers age-adjusted mortality estimates (18), which may
occur disproportionately among Hispanics because of their
relatively low levels of formal schooling and potentially
limited access to a birth certificate. All of these concerns
cumulate to raise questions about comparison of Hispanic
and non-Hispanic mortality using vital registration death
rates alone.
The second kind of data documenting a Hispanic mortality
advantage comes from studies that ascertain vital status for
large cohorts over a period of follow-up. Data from cohort
studies seemingly provide powerful corroborating evidence
about the Hispanic mortality advantage because they elimi-
nate concerns about inconsistent ethnic classification in
census and vital registration and reduce concerns about age
misstatement. Hispanic identification is fixed by self-report
at the beginning of the study, so inconsistency of reporting
ethnicity at subsequent points does not affect calculated
mortality rates. Two important studies have used this design.
The National Longitudinal Mortality Study reported
mortality follow-up for select cohorts from the Current
Population Survey. A second study has also ascertained
mortality for nine successive cohorts (1986­1994) from the
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Both data sets
showed mortality advantages for Hispanics compared with
non-Hispanic Whites (1, 2, 4).
However, cohort studies are vulnerable to a potential bias
resulting from underascertainment of mortality during the
follow-up period. Mortality follow-up for both the National
Longitudinal Mortality Study and the NHIS was accom-
plished by linking data on survey respondents to mortality
records in the National Death Index (NDI). The NDI
matching process uses the following information to identify
cases: first and last names, middle initial, father's surname,
Social Security number, date of birth, state of birth, state of
residence, sex, race, marital status, and age at death (19).
Researchers have developed probabilistic approaches that
classify cohort members as matched or unmatched to death
records based on the level of agreement and disagreement
between survey and death record information (20). This
matching process has been carefully validated by using cali-
bration samples from studies with an active follow-up of
vital status (21). Both the NDI database and the matching
method used for linkages between survey respondents and
NDI records are considered the "gold standard" for ascer-
tainment of mortality for a community cohort (22).
Important questions remain, however, about the accuracy
of death information when the NDI is used for Hispanic
cohorts. Emigration from the United States presents poten-
tial problems for NDI-based studies because deaths outside
of the country are not included in the NDI database. Even
when a death occurs in the United States, automated
matching algorithms may not work as well for Hispanics as
they do for other groups, especially non-Hispanic Whites.
There are several reasons for this concern. The NDI
matching method relies heavily on Social Security number
matches. Use and accuracy of Social Security numbers may
be lower both in survey responses and on death certificates
for segments of the Hispanic population that are undocu-
mented or whose work experience is primarily in the
informal agriculture or domestic service sectors. Name
matches may also be less reliable for Hispanics than for non-
Hispanic Whites because Hispanic naming practices differ
from non-Hispanic White conventions in several ways that
can affect how names are reported both to survey researchers
and on the death certificate. For example, many Hispanics
use both father's and mother's surnames as part of their
name. By custom, at marriage, the bride adds her husband's
surname while retaining her parents' surnames. For many
Hispanics, the first surname listed is considered the primary
surname, in contrast to the conventional US emphasis placed
on "last name." Identifying a single "middle name" may also
be difficult for some Hispanics because this term may refer
to one of several given names or one of several family
surnames. Anglicized name variants, for example, "Mary"
rather than "Maria," may also be used in giving information
to non-Hispanics (23).
A lower NDI match rate for Hispanics for any of these
reasons would increase the appearance of a Hispanic
mortality advantage. Unfortunately, performance of the NDI
Evaluation of Mortality Data for Mexican Americans 709
Am J Epidemiol 2004;159:707­715
matching algorithm has not been investigated for Hispanics
because the calibration samples used thus far have contained
few Hispanic members (24). These issues have contributed
to continuing debate about the existence and magnitude of
the Hispanic mortality advantage (11, 16).
The purpose of this study was to determine empirically
whether bias exists in Hispanic mortality estimates based on
an NDI search for a large cohort of older Mexican Ameri-
cans. Data from the Hispanic Established Populations for
Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) were used for
this investigation. The Hispanic EPESE collected identi-
fying information for all 12 items used in the NDI matching
process, making it possible to reproduce closely the
matching methods used in other population surveys linked to
the NDI. Additionally, the Hispanic EPESE includes 7 years
of active follow-up of vital status through interviews with
subjects or reports from proxy informants. This combination
of vital status information from proxy reports and the NDI
makes the Hispanic EPESE a unique data set evaluating
mortality information for Hispanics.
We performed three tasks in this study. First, we compared
vital status information from proxy informants and NDI
matches. Second, we examined discrepancies in mortality
ascertainment by age, sex, and nativity status. Finally, we
derived adjustment factors for underascertainment from the
Hispanic EPESE and applied them to 1986­1994 NHIS­
NDI linked data to illustrate the impact of these adjustment
factors on estimates of the Hispanic mortality advantage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study samples
The Hispanic EPESE is a cohort of 3,050 community-
dwelling Mexican Americans aged 65 years or older living
in the southwestern region of the United States (25). An area
probability sample was drawn in 1993­1994, with 83
percent of those originally sampled participating in the base-
line survey. This sample is representative of approximately
500,000 elderly Mexican Americans living in five south-
western states (Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico,
and Texas) during 1990 and was followed up through 2001,
with three subsequent waves of data collection in 1995­
1996, 1998­1999, and 2000­2001.
The first vital status information for the Hispanic EPESE
cohort was collected during each of the three follow-up
interview waves. If a subject was missing at follow-up, then
proxy respondents were asked whether the subject had died,
had moved, or had been admitted to a hospital, nursing
home, or hospice facility. Proxy informants who reported
that the subject was deceased were interviewed by using a
death questionnaire that asked the date, location, and cause
of death as well as questions about hospital or nursing home
admissions prior to the subject's death. The overwhelming
majority (86 percent) of proxy informants were family
members of the missing subject. In 164 instances, interviews
with proxy informants were not completed for subjects lost
over the follow-up period (i.e., neither the subject nor a
proxy informant was reinterviewed after baseline). There-
fore, data were analyzed for 2,886 subjects, with vital status
ascertained through interviews with subjects or proxy infor-
mants. Excluded subjects for whom vital status information
was missing were significantly younger (mean age, 69.2
years; standard deviation, 5.2 years) than those subjects
included in the data analysis (mean age, 73.3 years; standard
deviation, 6.8 years), although no differences were observed
by sex and nativity.
Vital status information obtained from interviews with
subjects or proxy informants (hereafter referred to as "proxy
reports") was compared with information from a match of
the Hispanic EPESE cohort to death records in the NDI data-
base through a search performed in 2002. Deaths through
December 31, 2000, were ascertained. The system used by
the National Center for Health Statistics (Hyattsville, Mary-
land) to match the NHIS to the NDI was used to identify
deaths of Hispanic EPESE subjects (26). This system
involves a two-step process. In the first step, NDI records are
identified as potential matches to subjects when one of nine
criteria is met (formerly 12 criteria were used by the NDI,
but, in 1999, four of the Social Security number­related
criteria were collapsed into a single Social Security number
match criterion). The nine criteria are various combinations
of agreement between supplied survey information and NDI
records on seven matching items. For a given subject, one or
more NDI records may be identified as potential matches;
for other subjects, no potential matches are identified. In the
second step, potentially matched records are evaluated to
determine whether one particular record can be identified as
a "true" match to the survey subject. In this step, statistical
weights derived from calibration samples provide investiga-
tors with probability scores to evaluate potential matches.
All potential matches are categorized into mutually exclu-
sive classes based on which items matched and the combina-
tion of matched items. Class-specific cutoffs of probability
scores are then used to identify "true" matches (21). Using the
NHIS-NDI cutoff scores, we identified 753 deaths among the
2,886 subjects in the Hispanic EPESE study sample.
To evaluate the implications of the findings from the
Hispanic EPESE for mortality differentials between
Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites, adjustment factors
calculated from the Hispanic EPESE data were applied to
mortality information estimated from the 1986­1994 NHIS
cohort data that were linked to the NDI. The NHIS is an
annual cross-sectional survey of approximately 75,000
persons, representative of the noninstitutionalized US adult
population. Vital status searches for subjects from these
surveys were performed through December 31, 1997, using
the NDI. To provide survival time comparable to that in the
Hispanic EPESE (7.5 years), data on subjects from the
1986­1991 NHIS cohorts were eligible for analysis. Data for
all 66,667 non-Hispanic White and Mexican-American
(self-identified as Mexican Mexicano, Mexican American,
or Chicano) subjects aged 65 years or older were used in the
analysis.
Data analysis
To compare the vital status of Hispanic EPESE subjects by
proxy reports and the NDI, both simple agreement and the
kappa statistic were calculated. Stratified analyses of
710 Patel et al.
Am J Epidemiol 2004;159:707­715
mortality by age, sex, and nativity were also performed to
investigate systematic differences in death ascertainment as
a function of each of these characteristics. For each vital
status source, logistic regression models were used to
examine univariate associations of vital status with age, sex,
and nativity. Multivariate proportional hazards models were
also estimated to determine the effects of demographic
factors on survival. Odds ratio and hazard ratio effect sizes
were compared across each vital status source.
To assess the magnitude of death underascertainment bias,
ratios of proxy-reported to NDI mortality rates as well as 95
percent confidence intervals were calculated using the
Hispanic EPESE data. To determine how this level of
underascertainment would affect estimates of mortality for
Mexican Americans in comparison to non-Hispanic Whites,
these mortality ratios were then applied as adjustment factors
to 1986­1994 NHIS Mexican-American (subjects aged 65
years) mortality rates. Multiplying the stratum-specific
mortality ratio by the respective NHIS observed mortality
rate provided an adjusted mortality rate. This methodology
has been used previously to adjust mortality data for incon-
sistent race/ethnicity classifications of Native Americans in
the United States and Mäoris in New Zealand (27­29).
Age standardizations for observed and adjusted mortality
rates were made in the NHIS data by using the direct
method. Standardized rates were prepared for each sex
within each ethnic group (Mexican Americans and non-
Hispanic Whites). All subjects aged 65 years or older in the
entire 1986­1997 NHIS data set were considered the stan-
dard population. Age-standardized mortality rate ratios of
NHIS Mexican Americans to non-Hispanic Whites were
calculated with 95 percent confidence intervals by using the
Mexican-American (exposed group) distribution as the
reference standard (30).
Prior to applying adjustment factors from the Hispanic
EPESE to the rates calculated from the NHIS­NDI, it was
important to ensure that the mortality structure was compa-
rable between the two data sets. The age distributions of NDI
deaths in the Hispanic EPESE and the NHIS were found to
be similar.
For Hispanic EPESE subjects, survival time was estimated
separately for each vital status source. The survival clock
began with the baseline interview date for both sources. For
mortality rates based on the NDI, subjects were right
censored either on their date of death according to NDI or on
December 31, 2000, for unmatched cases. Censoring
subjects for whom proxy report information was available
depended on reinterview status. If a subject refused to partic-
ipate in the study at follow-up, then he or she was right
censored at the midpoint of that data collection period (dates
of refused interviews were not recorded). Proxy informants
who reported that a subject had died were asked for the
month and year of the death, which was used as the
censoring date (the 15th was used as the day of death for all
proxy-reported deaths). Subjects were right censored on
December 31, 2000, if a censoring event occurred after this
date. Finally, those subjects interviewed in the fourth wave
of data collection were right censored either on December
31, 2000, or their date of interview that preceded January 1,
2001.
In calculating the preadjustment survival time from the
NHIS-NDI data, survival time also began on the date of
interview. To make 1986­1997 NHIS survival data compa-
rable to the 1993/1994­2000 Hispanic EPESE data, subjects
whose survival time exceeded 7.5 years were right censored
at this maximal point (2,740 days). All other NHIS subjects
were right censored with death dates from the NDI or
December 31, 1997, whichever came first. Data were
analyzed by using the SAS and SUDAAN statistical pack-
ages (31, 32).
RESULTS
Among Hispanic EPESE subjects, crude mortality based
on proxy reports was 29.6 percent over the 7.5-year follow-
up period (table 1). An NDI search over the same time period
yielded a lower crude mortality estimate of 26.1 percent.
Vital status classifications between the two sources agreed
on 91.2 percent of the cases. A kappa value of 0.78 demon-
strated reasonable concordance between the two sources
while adjusting for chanceful agreement. Nonetheless, a
total of 177 (20.7 percent) deaths reported by proxy infor-
mants were not identified by the NDI.
Table 2 shows the demographic predictors of vital status
classifications for Hispanic EPESE subjects by NDI and
proxy reports. We found that the effect of age on mortality
was stronger with proxy-reported information than when the
NDI was used. This difference stemmed from fewer deaths
identified by the NDI of very old Mexican Americans. For
example, for subjects aged 80 years or older, proxy infor-
mants reported 60 deaths not identified by the NDI. (Note
that only marginal totals are shown for each subgroup in
table 2; therefore, counts reported in this paragraph cannot
be directly calculated from table 2.) In addition, the mortality
effect of male compared with female gender was weaker in
the proxy-reported information than in the NDI data. A total
of 116 women were not classified as dead by the NDI but
had died according to proxy informants. Finally, foreign-
born nativity was protective for mortality based on NDI clas-
sifications; however, this effect was not significant in the
proxy death data because informants reported an additional
99 deaths of foreign-born subjects not classified as dead by
the NDI.

Age- and nativity-specific mortality rates were calculated
separately for Hispanic EPESE men and women because of
significant sex-by-age and sex-by-nativity effect modifica-
tion (interaction tests are not shown). Ratios of proxy report
to NDI mortality rates are shown in table 3. Although
mortality rates were higher for men than for women, discrep-
ancies between the two vital status sources were larger for
women than for men and were more pronounced when strat-
ified by age and nativity. Among men, for example, proxy-
informed mortality rates were approximately 1.1 times
higher than NDI rates for each age stratum. For women,
however, mortality ratios were larger, especially in the older
age groups. Similarly, the proxy-informed mortality rate for
foreign-born men was 1.1 times higher than the NDI rate; for
women, it was 1.4 times higher. Overall, proxy-reported
mortality rates were higher, by 9 percent for men and 28
percent for women, than rates based on the NDI.

aged 65­69 years). This pattern extended to age-standard-
ized mortality rates and rates by nativity, suggesting the
existence of a Hispanic paradox. However, when Hispanic
EPESE mortality ratios (of proxy report to the NDI) were
applied as adjustment factors to NHIS Mexican-American
mortality rates (third column), adjusted mortality rates for
Mexican-American women exceeded rates observed for
non-Hispanic White women for all age and nativity strata.
Adjustments also affected death rates for Mexican-American
men, particularly in the foreign-born category. The original
rate ratio of the Mexican-American to the non-Hispanic
White age-standardized mortality rate was 0.77 (95 percent
confidence interval: 0.65, 0.92) for men and 0.92 (95 percent
confidence interval: 0.77, 1.09) for women, but the adjusted
rate ratios were 0.84 and 1.18, respectively. Thus, the
adjusted age-standardized Mexican-American mortality rate
for men remained lower compared with the age-standardized
non-Hispanic White rate; however, for Mexican-American
women, the adjusted rate was higher than the non-Hispanic
White rate by 18 percent.
DISCUSSION
Findings from this investigation indicate that deaths of
older Mexican Americans are underascertained when the
Hispanic EPESE cohort is linked to the NDI. If these find-
ings generalize to other data sets, Hispanic mortality rates
based on cohort studies linked to the NDI are understated.
Death underascertainment by the NDI was most apparent for
Mexican-American women aged 75 years or older and
women born outside of the United States. Once this pattern
was accounted for, the age-adjusted mortality rate was
substantially higher for older Mexican-American women
compared with older non-Hispanic White women. Thus, the
mortality disadvantage experienced by Hispanic women is
undetected in studies linked to the NDI. This pattern of
gender difference in mortality rates adjusted for underascer-
tainment reproduces earlier reports that the Hispanic advan-
tage, if it exists, is primarily true for men (33).
Much of the discordance between proxy-reported and
NDI-identified deaths likely stems from problems with
matching of Social Security numbers. Although researchers
evaluating the NDI report that death ascertainment is good
when identifiers other than Social Security number (34­36)
are used,the most important determinant of an NDI match is
the Social Security number (37, 38). Indeed, the sensitivity
of NDI death identification has exceeded 95 percent when
Social Security numbers were used (22). Given the impor-
tance of the Social Security number for NDI death ascertain-
ment, it is not surprising that misclassification was most
concentrated among the oldest old and foreign-born
Mexican-American women. It is likely that some of these
women born before 1919 were never employed in the formal
US economy or for a time had undocumented immigrant
status and thus never acquired a valid Social Security
number. For example, our tabulations of the California
mortality master file for the years 1993­1998 confirmed that
the Social Security number field was blank for 7.3 percent of
Mexican-American women and 5.6 percent of Mexican-

Evaluation of Mortality Data for Mexican Americans 713
Am J Epidemiol 2004;159:707­715
American men born before 1919 compared with just 0.4
percent of non-Hispanic White men and women in the same
age group. Another possibility is that older Mexican Ameri-
cans may use relatives' or friends' Social Security numbers
or that women may use their husband's. Thus, reliance on the
Social Security number for NDI death matching may be
problematic for older Mexican Americans, especially
women. The findings from this study are concordant with
these expectations.
Other major identifiers, such as date of birth, sex, or race,
did not yield many NDI matches for Hispanic EPESE
subjects. Only 119 Hispanic EPESE subjects were identified
as dead by the NDI when the Social Security number did not
match, even though all other identifiers were supplied to the
NDI. That is, the Hispanic EPESE had fewer NDI matches
with probability scores meeting cutoffs for classification
categories that do not require a Social Security number. This
problem could result from misrecording of data by survey
interviewers or misrecording of information on death certifi-
cates, such as name misspelling or use of a name variant. For
example, our tabulation of 1993­1998 California State vital
statistics data found that persons identified as Mexican
American were more than twice as likely as non-Hispanic
Whites (34.0 percent vs. 14.0 percent) to have a blank
middle name field in the data and were more than seven
times as likely (5.9 percent vs. 0.8 percent) to report
mother's maiden name as their own surname. This height-
ened potential for misrecording of items both on death certif-
icates and in survey responses underscores the challenges of
matching Hispanics to the NDI.
The relatively high proportion of underascertained deaths
of foreign-born persons is consistent with the "salmon bias"
hypothesis, which predicts a higher rate of underascertain-
ment for the foreign born because it is likely that emigration
from the United States would be more common for the
foreign born than for those born in the United States (10).
That is, some of the foreign born may maintain active social
ties in the home community that they left when they came to
the United States (39). They may choose to return home for
social support when they experience illness (40). However,
only 21 of the 99 foreign-born Hispanic EPESE decedents
(21.2 percent) not matched by the NDI were reported by
proxy informants to have died in Mexico. Thus, "salmon
bias" accounts for only a small proportion of deaths not
ascertained by the NDI.
Use of automated matching algorithms is a practical
necessity for studies that seek to link large population-based
cohorts to the NDI. That these algorithms can sometimes fail
is well understood. NDI documentation emphasizes that the
classification and scoring apparatus provided to users of this
service are intended as tools rather than definitive determi-
nants of vital status. It is the responsibility of the end user to
use the results of the algorithm, along with any additional
information available, to determine whether a record is
matched (19). The experience of linking the Hispanic
EPESE to the NDI suggests that standard algorithms cali-
brated for the general US population may not work as well
for this population subgroup.
Alternative practices for submitting survey records for an
NDI search may improve the match rate for Hispanics. For
example, researchers who are collecting survey data on
Hispanic populations and anticipate linking these data to the
NDI database may want to collect information about both
mother's and father's surnames and to submit duplicate
records with each parental surname as "last name." All
possible middle initials derived from parental surnames and
from middle names may be tested. Records may be
submitted without Social Security numbers to prevent false
nonmatches from misreported Social Security numbers.
Researchers should also carefully review potential matches
at a lower threshold of probability than is the case for other
groups. Until such alternative practices can be developed
into calibrated scoring algorithms sensitive to different use
of identifiers for Hispanic populations, NDI-based compari-
sons of mortality rates for Hispanics and other subpopula-
tions should be made with caution.
The current study is limited because death certificates
were unavailable to permit a more nuanced evaluation of the
NDI matching method for Hispanics. Such evaluation could
identify matching elements that may need to be weighted
differently for Hispanics to optimize the matching algorithm
in this ethnic group. In addition, differences in data collec-
tion procedures between the Hispanic EPESE and the NHIS
did not allow a direct assessment of the NHIS­NDI
matching process. Application of bias estimates from the
Hispanic EPESE to the NHIS­NDI study is reported only to
illustrate the magnitude of underascertainment effects on the
Hispanic mortality paradox. Finally, mortality estimates for
non-Hispanic Whites were not adjusted for underascertain-
ment because a second source of vital status information was
not available for the NHIS­NDI cohort.In studies that report
sensitivity of the NDI, estimates range from 92 percent to 98
percent for Whites (37, 41, 42). Considering that Hispanics
are included in these estimates, the sensitivity of the NDI for
non-Hispanic Whites is likely closer to the upper bound.
Assuming that the NDI has a sensitivity of 95 percent for
non-Hispanic White men and women, the mortality rate ratio
adjusted for underascertainment would likely reduce to 0.80
for men and 1.12 for women.
The strength and importance of this study is that it is the
first known to evaluate NDI matching in a large sample of
Hispanics with a second independent source of vital status
information. The current study documents a pattern of NDI
death underascertainment that has implications for
comparing death rates across racial and ethnic groups. An
important implication is that small classification errors or
underperformance of the matching algorithm for subgroups
can have an important effect on calculated ethnic differen-
tials, especially for the older Hispanic population. The
social and economic characteristics of this population
likely contribute to data quality problems that lead to over-
statement of the Hispanic mortality advantage in cohort
studies linked to the NDI. Results from this study and
others underscore the importance of interpreting mortality
rates for ethnic minority groups with caution. Considering
that death rates by race/ethnicity are used to set and eval-
uate "Healthy People 2010" goals (43), improving the
quality of vital registration and data reporting systems for
ethnic minority populations needs to become a greater
public health priority.
