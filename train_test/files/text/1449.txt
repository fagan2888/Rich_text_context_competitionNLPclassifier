Cholesterol treatment with statins: Who is left out
and who makes it to goal?

Abstract
Background: Whether patient socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, and education)
are independently associated with failure to receive indicated statin therapy and/or to achieve low density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) therapy goals are not known. We examined socio-demographic factors associated
with a) eligibility for statin therapy among those not on statins, and b) achievement of statin therapy goals.
Methods: Adults (21-79 years) participating in the United States (US) National Health and Nutrition Examination
Surveys, 1999-2006 were studied. Statin eligibility and achievement of target LDL-C was assessed using the US
Third Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) on Treatment of High Cholesterol guidelines.
Results: Among 6,043 participants not taking statins, 10.4% were eligible. Adjusted predictors of statin eligibility
among statin non-users were being older, male, poorer, and less educated. Hispanics were less likely to be eligible
but not using statins, an effect that became non-significant with adjustment for language usually spoken at home.
Among 537 persons taking statins, 81% were at LDL-C goal. Adjusted predictors of goal failure among statin users
were being male and poorer. These risks were not attenuated by adjustment for healthcare access or utilization.
Conclusion: Among person's not taking statins, the socio-economically disadvantaged are more likely to be
eligible and among those on statins, the socio-economically disadvantaged are less likely to achieve statin
treatment goals. Further study is needed to identify specific amenable patient and/or physician factors that
contribute to these disparities.
Background
Disparities in the use of procedures by race, ethnicity,
sex, and socioeconomic status (SES) have been widely
documented including invasive cardiovascular interven-
tions [1,2], joint replacement surgery [2,3], and other
new or expensive technology [4,5]. These disparities
may reflect either potential access (e.g. insurance or reg-
ular source of care) or realized access (visit number), [6]
expenses (often not fully covered by insurance)[7] in
addition to slower diffusion of innovation to minority
patients or possibly to physicians and hospitals serving
them [8-11].
In contrast, there is considerably less evidence for dis-
parity in use of drugs for common, chronic conditions
[12]. For example, there are few racial and ethnic dispa-
rities in inpatient medical management of congestive
heart failure [13] and coronary artery disease [14] or in
outpatient management of hypertension [15].
Statins may be an exception. They may be used less
frequently among African Americans and poor patients
[16-21] and these patients may be less likely to achieve
target low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal
[22,23]. These findings have been variously limited by
absence of cholesterol measurement, suboptimal SES
measurement, and/or failure to fully apply the Third
Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) recommendations for
treatment of elevated LDL-C.
Using recent US national data that included details on
LDC-C levels, statin use, socio-demographic characteris-
tics including race/ethnicity and SES, and healthcare
access/utilization, three hypotheses were examined: 1)
among persons not receiving statins, race/ethnicity, and
lower SES would be associated with statin eligibility; 2)
among persons currently receiving statins, race/ethnicity,
and lower SES would be associated with lower likelihood

Methods
Study Sample
Publicly available data were used from the continuous
National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANES) conducted between 1999 and 2006.
NHANES is an ongoing survey designed to provide
nationally representative estimates for the non-institu-
tionalized population of the United States based on a
complex multistage probability sample [24]. Survey data
included household interviews, examinations, and test-
ing. Following the interview, participants were invited to
mobile examination centers. The protocol for NHANES
was approved by the National Center for Health Statis-
tics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was
obtained from each participant. During the study period,
the response rate to the examination varied between 76-
80% [25].
Measures
Key independent variables were demographics (self
reported age, sex, and race/ethnicity) and SES (house-
hold income [categorized as <100, 100-<150, 150-<200,
200-<300, 300-<400, and  400 percent of the federal
poverty level] and highest educational attainment [<12,
12, and  12 years schooling]).
Statin use was based on a series of questions about
prescription drugs reported taken during the previous
month. For each drug reported, verification was
obtained by asking the participant to show the medica-
tion container. Duration of use was also collected.
Statin eligibility and goal attainment were assessed
using additional history, examination, and laboratory
data. History factors included: coronary heart disease
(CHD), myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, peripheral
vascular disease, diabetes, cigarette smoking, use of anti-
hypertensive medication, and family history of CHD.
Access/utilization factors included: language usually
spoken at home (English vs. other); health insurance sta-
tus (any vs. none), availability of usual source of care
(any vs. none), and physician visits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or  5
per year).
Blood pressure was recorded as the average of up to
two mercury manometer measurements (the first mea-
surement was not included) obtained from the partici-
pant while sitting after a 5-minute rest [26]. Participants
were classified as having hypertension if they had a sys-
tolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more and/or dia-
stolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or more and/or they
reported currently using antihypertensive medication.
Blood samples were centrifuged and stored at -20°C
and transferred to the Lipoprotein Analytical Laboratory
at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, for lipid
analyses. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides were measured using
the Hitachi 704 Analyzer. LDL-C was calculated using
the Friedwald equation if triglycerides were <400 mg/dl.
Assessment for Statin eligibility and Target LDL-C
ATP III recommendations from 2004 for LDL-C man-
agement were used to assess statin eligibility and goal
attainment [27,28]. Patients with no CHD or no CHD
risk equivalents (diabetes, stroke or peripheral vascular
disease) were scored on a count of major CHD risk fac-
tors (cigarette smoking, hypertension, low HDL-C
[<40 mg/dl], family history of premature CHD, and
older age [45  years for men; 55  y for women]);
HDL-C 60 mg/dl or greater was considered protective
and reduced the score by one. Participants with two or
more risk factors underwent FRS to derive absolute 10
year CHD risk.
For adults with 0-1 risk factors, the statin eligibility
threshold was an LDL-C  190 mg/dl with a treatment
goal of <160 mg/dl. For adults with 2+ risk factors, the
treatment goal was 130 mg/dl, with statin eligibility
thresholds of 130 mg/dl for those with a 10-year CHD
risk of 10-20% and 160 mg/dl if the risk was <10%. For
participants with CHD, CHD risk equivalents, or FRS
>20%, the statin eligibility and treatment goal for LDL-C
were 100 mg/dl.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive, univariate, and regression analyses were
conducted using STATA (version 10.1, StataCorp, Col-
lege Station, TX), adjusting for the complex survey
design of NHANES to yield population parameter esti-
mates and appropriate standard errors. Logistic regres-
sion analyses examined the relationship between the key
socio-demographic factors and: a) statin eligibility
among those not on statins (the dependent variable was
whether the respondent was eligible for statin therapy
according to ATP criteria); and, b) goal attainment
among those on statins (the dependent variable was
whether the LDL-C level was at goal). To address
whether access/utilization-related factors attenuated dis-
parities, the analyses were conducted without and with
adjustment for access/utilization-related factors. All ana-
lyses adjusted for study year. Regression results are pre-
sented as average marginal effects (AMEs), not adjusted
odds ratios, to facilitate interpretation. The AME is the
adjusted difference in prevalence of outcome (in %)
between given category of predictor and its reference
group.

Supplementary and sensitivity analyses examined
model fit and explored possible explanatory pathways,
including examining two-way interactions among inde-
pendent variables, and adjusting for duration of statin
therapy (< 1 year vs.  1 year), statin potency (atorvasta-
tin or rosuvastatin vs. less potent [doses were not avail-
able]), and subject reported: prior testing for cholesterol;
knowledge of cholesterol level; and doctor recommenda-
tion for treatment. Additional analyses excluded those
with a history of liver disease (a possible contra-indica-
tion for statins).
Results
Altogether, the NHANES surveys included 18,042 adults
age 21-79. Data for FRS scoring was available on 15,260
(91% population weighted) of the sample. Persons with
missing FRS information were more likely to be women
(57% vs. 51%, p < .01), to have household incomes <
100% poverty level (17% vs. 12%, p < .01), and more
likely (p < .01) to be African American (20% vs. 10%) or
other race (7% vs. 5%). LDL-C levels were collected on a
subset (N = 6913, population weighted = 45%) of those
with FRS data; those without LDL-C were more likely to
have household incomes < 100% poverty level (13% vs.
10%). Complete socio-demographic and LDL-C data
were available on 6,580 persons. Of those with complete
data, 537 (7.7%) reported current statin use. The charac-
teristics of persons currently receiving compared to
those not receiving statins are shown in Table 1; those
not receiving statins were younger, poorer, disproportio-
nately female, Black or Hispanic, lacked a usual source
of care, had fewer visits, and were also more likely to
have been surveyed in earlier years (p all < .01).
Among the 6,043 participants not taking statins, 10.4%
were eligible but not taking statins. Table 1 (last col-
umn) shows the factors associated with being eligible;
these groups included: being older, male, non-Hispanic,
poorer, less educated, uninsured, and having more visits
(p all < .01).
Logistic regression analyses revealed the socio-demo-
graphic risk factors for being eligible (among those not
taking statins) included being older, male, having lower
income, and less education (Table 2). Hispanics were
less likely to be eligible, an effect that became not signif-
icant after adjustment for the access/utilization variables
(primarily language). None of the other socio-demo-
graphic effects observed were significantly attenuated by
adjustment for the access/utilization variables. Among
two-way interactions, the gender*age group effect was
significant; the gender disparity in eligibility increased
with age (Figure 1).
Table 3 shows ATP III goal attainment among statin
users and non-users. Among the 537 persons taking sta-
tins, 81.3% were at LDL goal. Goal attainment was less
likely in men and poorer persons (p all < .01). The logis-
tic regression analyses revealed that goal attainment was
associated with being female and having higher income
(Table 4); the effects of age, race/ethnicity, and educa-
tion were not significant. There was no significant effect
of the access/utilization variables. No interactions were
statistically significant.
The supplementary analyses of statin eligibility among
those not taking statins produced results similar to
those presented. These models adjusted for patients
reporting cholesterol testing (69%), patient knowledge of
own cholesterol level (23%), and patient reporting as to
whether the physician recommended treatment (8%);
and, excluded those with a history of liver disease
(3.7%).
Supplementary analyses of goal attainment examined
the potential confounding effect of duration and potency
of statin therapy. About 25% of respondents had been
on statins for < 1 year, but there was no evidence that
duration of therapy predicted goal attainment (<1 year,
78% vs. longer, 80%, p = 0.6). Statin potency was not
significantly associated with goal attainment (p = 0.2),
and did not affect the AMEs of the socio-demographic
variables.
Discussion
Analysis of this US nationally representative sample
revealed significant disparities in the use of statins.
Adults eligible, but not taking statins, were more likely
to be older, male, of lower income, and less educated.
The gender effect increased significantly with age.
Among patients currently receiving statins, being male
and having less income were associated with failure to
attain LDL-C goal.
In contrast to previous US studies that used limited
income adjustment [16-21], race/ethnicity was not sig-
nificantly associated with statin eligibility or goal attain-
ment; the study discrepancies suggest the key role of
income.
Much of the US disparity literature has focused on
race and ethnicity. These results underscore the signifi-
cance of sex and SES on appropriate use of statins and
on LDL-C goal attainment. Following a myocardial
infarction men are more likely to receive appropriate
interventions including angiography and revasculariza-
tion [14]. However, men are more likely to be eligible,
but not taking statins, and less likely to be at goal if
treated. These findings, while contrasting with studies
examining gender differences in the use of invasive pro-
cedures, are consistent with the notion that women may
be more effective users of ambulatory care than men
[29], and with findings that among those with high cho-
lesterol women are both more likely to be aware of their
condition [30] and more likely to be treated [21]. In

addition, male sex and older age are included in FRS.
This effectively lowers treatment thresholds among men
and older persons, possibly contributing to sex and/or
age disparities.
Among untreated persons, those with less income and
less education are more likely to be eligible. These
findings are consistent with previous studies showing
that low SES is associated with less adequate care
[12,31,32] including less statin initiation and persistence
among those with lower income [33-35]. These effects
may reflect barriers related to cost [36] and possibly
patient beliefs [37].

There was little impact of access/utilization-related
factors on disparities, other than for Hispanics. This
may reflect a dominating effect of statin cost and lack
of measures of usual source of primary care. At the
time of this study, most statins were expensive and
having insurance (including Medicare during this era)
did not ensure prescription coverage. Even among
those with insurance, higher copayments, and
formulary restrictions deter statin use [38,39]. Further-
more, physicians consider formulary restrictions and
patient out-of-pocket costs when making prescribing
decisions [7,40]. However, it is worth noting that the
findings on SES disparities are consistent with studies
from countries with more equitable health systems
(less socio-economically driven access barriers) includ-
ing Australia [41] and Denmark[42]. Because these stu-
dies did not adjust for FRS, and lower SES is
associated with a more adverse FRS profile [43] they
likely under-estimate disparities in statin use. Taken
together, these studies are consistent with research on
the diffusion of new technologies, including statins,
showing lower SES persons lag behind in the uptake of
those new interventions [44].

The protective Hispanic effect, i.e. a lower likelihood
of Hispanics being eligible, and its attenuation with
adjustment for language is consistent with studies
demonstrating Hispanics have better adjusted health sta-
tus than Whites, a benefit that attenuates with greater
acculturation [45-47].
Given the powerful effects of statins on cardiovascular
and all-cause mortality, these results are concerning.
Less optimal management of cholesterol among men
and lower SES persons may contribute to higher CHD
mortality [48]. The under-treatment of lower SES
patients may exacerbate their risk for higher CHD mor-
tality and contribute to widening disparities in CHD
mortality [48]. In addition, because FRS does not fully
account for the higher CHD risk in lower SES persons,
fewer lower SES persons are identified for treatment
than warranted [48]. Thus, lower SES persons may be at
triple jeopardy: under-identified for treatment, under-
treated once identified as eligible, and less likely to
achieve treatment goals.
There are several potential explanations for the overall
findings. Differences in statin eligibility among untreated
patients could reflect physician and/or patient factors.
However, an analysis adjusting for whether or not per-
sons reported their physician recommended treatment
produced similar results. The absence of an apparent
effect of physician recommendation suggests that patient
factors including acceptance of prescriptions for statins
or differences in adherence barriers such as cost may
contribute to higher rates of statin eligibility among the
untreated. The overall low rate of physician recommen-
dation among untreated patients (probably related in
part to sequencing conditional questions), and potential
bias in respondent recall of physician recommendations
suggests caution in inferring an absence of physician
contribution to these disparities. Further study is needed
to determine the relative roles of patient factors (e.g.
cost or beliefs) or physician factors (failure to adhere to
guidelines) in contributing to these disparities. Doing so
will facilitate the design of interventions to mitigate
these disparities.
Study Limitations
These finding are limited by reliance on cross-sectional
data. The data provide no direct information on pre-
treatment cholesterol levels, drug doses, or number of
times that physicians intensified therapy. Thus, the
appropriateness of statin use among users cannot be
precisely determined. For example, over-treatment of
non-Hispanic Whites could have reduced the pool of
untreated persons, masking racial differences. Variables
selected to assess access/utilization may not optimally
capture the underlying constructs. Thus, language
usually spoken at home may not adequately capture
access related to English proficiency; however, this vari-
able performed similarly to one indicating interview lan-
guage or use of interpreter. Last, we lacked data related
to statin dose or cost. Some of those on statins achiev-
ing treatment goals may have been at goal without treat-
ment. Limited sample size for some analyses,
particularly assessing goal attainment for persons on sta-
tins, may have compromised power to detect significant
effects.
Conclusions
In conclusion, these US national data show that, among
persons not taking statins, those with less income and
men are more likely than their respective counterparts
to be eligible, and, among those taking statins, these
groups are also less likely to attain their LDL-C goal.
Further study is needed to identify specific amenable
patient and/or physician factors that contribute to these
disparities.
