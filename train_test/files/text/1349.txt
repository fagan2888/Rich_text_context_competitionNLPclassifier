Nutritional Assessment of Patients With
Schizophrenia: A Preliminary Study
by Martin Strassnig, Jaspreet Singh Brar, and Rohan Qanguli
Abstract
The prevalence of obesity in the United States popula-
tion is increasing, and similar trends can be observed
among schizophrenia patients. No thorough examina-
tion of the actual nutritional composition of the diet of
schizophrenia patients in the United States has been
carried out. We therefore employed a 24-hour diet
recall in 146 schizophrenia outpatients to gather infor-
mation on different nutritional variables, such as total
caloric intake and total fat, protein, carbohydrate,
cholesterol, and fiber content Data were subsequently
compared to data for the general population collected
in the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III). Schizophrenia
patients as a group ate more food when compared to
NHANES HI subjects, but the relative percentages of
calories derived from fat, protein, and carbohydrates
were not found to be different. Therefore, it is unlikely
that schizophrenia patients make dietary choices dif-
ferent from those of people in the general population.
Instead, schizophrenia patients seem to eat more of the
same food.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diet of com-
munity-dwelling schizophrenia patients in the United
States. It is known that patients with schizophrenia in
North America tend to be overweight (Allison et al. 1999).
Obesity itself is widely regarded as a major medical haz-
ard (National Task Force on the Prevention and Treatment
of Obesity 2000) and is increasing in prevalence (Mokdad
et al. 1999). The risks include insulin resistance, diabetes
mellitus, hypertriglyceridemia, decreased levels of high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased levels of
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Obesity is also associ-
ated with gallbladder disease as well as sleep apnea,
chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia, degenerative joint dis-
ease, and certain cancers. Obesity is an independent risk
factor for death from coronary heart disease (Pi-Sunyer
1993).
While the etiopathogenesis of weight gain in schizo-
phrenia remains unclear, there is consensus that obesity is
primarily a result of poor dietary choices (Brown et al.
1999). There are only a handful of studies that have sys-
tematically examined the diet of patients with schizophre-
nia. In a nutritional assessment among people living in
"mental health residential houses" in Sydney, Australia, it
was observed that the respondents had a significantly
higher prevalence of obesity (including abdominal obe-
sity) than did the general population (Wallace and Tennant
1998). In studies completed in Scotland and Oxford, U.K.,
it was observed that schizophrenia patients' diet was
higher in fat and lower in fiber and vitamins as compared
to the healthy controls' diet (McCreadie et al. 1998;
Brown et al. 1999). While similar dietary trends may be
observed among U.S. schizophrenia patients, systematic
studies examining the associations between diet, sociode-
mographic, and physical characteristics have not been car-
ried out.
Methods
Subjects. Patients with a DSM-FV (American Psychiatric
Association 1994) diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaf-
fective disorder, and psychotic disorder not otherwise
specified (NOS) were recruited from the outpatient clinic
and partial hospital at the Comprehensive Care Services at
the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic by their thera-
pists, psychiatrists, and nurses. No attempts to target cer-
tain patient groups (i.e., overweight patients) took place,
and no randomized recruitment procedures were applied.

Patients willing to participate in the study were invited to
the interview. Diagnoses were confirmed by patient chart
review. Assessments were carried out after obtaining writ-
ten informed consent according to procedures approved
by the University of Pittsburgh Biomedical Institutional
Review Board. The procedure took about 45 minutes per
participant and yielded information in three different
domains: (1) sociodemographic data, (2) nutritional infor-
mation, and (3) anthropometric measures.
Data Collection. Sociodemographic data were obtained
by open-ended questions. When information was missing,
patient charts were reviewed. A 24-hour diet recall using
standardized food models was used to collect the nutri-
tional information. This method is widely regarded as
suitable for ascertaining dietary intake (Young et al. 1952;
Madden et al. 1976) and has been employed in the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANES) (Kohlmeier 1992). Weight and height were
recorded in kilograms and meters, respectively, and body
mass index (BMI) was calculated (kg/m2). BMI cate-
gories adopted by the National Institutes of Health (1998),
overweight if BMI 25 to 29.9 kg/m2, and obese if BMI
greater than 30 kg/m2, were used to categorize individuals
in the study sample.
BMI of patients in the study was compared to age-
adjusted BMI for the general population from NHANES
III (Kuczmarski et al. 1994). Nutritional values (calories,
protein, carbohydrate, fat, cholesterol, fiber, caffeine) were
computed using the commercially available ESHA (Eliza-
beth Stuart Hands and Associates) Food Processor Nutri-
tion software 7.5 (Lee et al. 1995) and compared to nutri-
tional data for the general population from NHANES III
(Alaimo et al. 1994; McDowell et al. 1994). While several
years have elapsed since NHANES III data were collected,
they are still commonly used as a reference standard for
the U.S. population.
Data Analysis. SPSS (for Windows) software was
employed for data analysis. Descriptive analysis includ-
ing mean, range, and standard deviation for continuous
variables was carried out to determine whether each
variable was normally distributed, and frequency counts
for categorical data (e.g., gender, race) were done to
examine the proportions of various sociodemographic
characteristics. The measures obtained through the 24-
hour recall were examined for the whole group and for
groups defined by different demographic characteristics
(for males and females, Caucasians and African-
Americans). Student / tests and, where appropriate, an
analysis of variance were employed to look for statisti-
cal differences between the means of 2 or more vari-
ables. Student / tests also were used to compare mean
nutritional values of the patient sample to data reported
in NHANES III.
Results
One hundred and forty-six patients with a DSM-IV diag-
nosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and psy-
chotic disorder NOS were recruited. Sociodemographic
data are shown in table 1.
The BMI of 27 patients (18.5%) was in the healthy
range (BMI < 24.9). Thirty-two patients (21.9%) were
overweight, with a BMI between 24.9 and 29.9. Eighty-
seven patients (59.6%) could be classified as obese, indi-
cated by a BMI of more than 30.
The mean BMI of sample patients was significantly
higher when compared to the age-adjusted reference popu-
lation from NHANES III (mean BMI = 26.3). Similar
results were observed among male and female as well as
Caucasian and African-American patients.
As a group, sample subjects consumed significantly
more total calories, carbohydrates, and fat than the refer-
ence population (table 2). The relative percentages of calo-
ries derived from the major nutrients (protein, carbohy-
drates, and fat) were not found to be different from the
percentages seen in the general population. No differences
in cholesterol or fiber intake were found with respect to
the NHANES ID data.

However, diets of male patients did not differ signifi-
cantly from the diet of the age-adjusted general population
reported in the NHANES III study. Only carbohydrate
intake came close to reaching significance (p = 0.0502, t =
1.96). In contrast, female participants consumed signifi-
cantly more total calories, protein, carbohydrate, and fat
than the reference population of the NHANES III survey.
Female participants also consumed more fiber than
females in the general population.
Regarding caffeine intake, white schizophrenia
patients (619 mg ± 708) consumed significantly more caf-
feine (p £ 0.005, t = 3.62) than African-American patients
did (298 mg ± 320). Caffeine intake was also significantly
higher (p < 0.05, t = 2.84) in smokers (571.8 mg ± 675)
than in nonsmokers (324 mg ± 376). There were no com-
parable NHANES HI data to compare our findings on caf-
feine with.
Only 6 patients in the study reported consumption of
alcoholic beverages during the previous 24 hours. Because
of this small number, no reliable analysis could be carried
out.
Limitations
Socioeconomic factors are known to influence the preva-
lence of obesity. Therefore, the inclusion of a matched
control group to correct for several socioeconomic factors
(i.e., educational level, income) would have improved the
value of the results. Although having a locally collected
control group would have improved the study method-
ologically, the study funding did not allow for such an
expense. It should also be noted that the findings can be
confidently extrapolated to only similar clinical popula-
tions: community-dwelling remitted individuals with diag-
noses of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. For-
tunately, the majority of people with these disorders would
fall into the above category.
Conclusions
As a group, schizophrenia patients in this study ate more
calories and nutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat) com-
pared to subjects in the NHANES HI study, because the
absolute amounts of calories derived from these nutrients
were higher. However, the relative percentages of intake
for protein, carbohydrates, and fat were not found to be
different from the pattern observed in the general popula-
tion. Therefore, it is unlikely that schizophrenia patients
make dietary choices different from the choices that sub-
jects in the population would make. Instead, they seem to
eat more of the same food.
The high mean BMI among the study sample is con-
sistent with the findings of other studies (Gopalaswamy
and Morgan 1985; Stedman and Welham 1993). When sub-
jects were divided by race and gender, black females had
the highest relative fat intake (37.5% of total calories) as
well as the highest BMI (36.1 ± 6.2). The prevalence of
high BMI in black females has been previously reported in
395
Schizophrenia Bulletin, Vol. 29, No. 2, 2003 M. Strassnig et al.
samples of the general population (Allison et al. 1997;
Holmes et al. 1998) and is consistent with an increased risk
for medical problems in this subgroup (Cowie et al. 1993;
Winkleby et al. 1999). It may be necessary to plan for gen-
der- and culture-specific approaches to address the problem
of obesity among black females. Medication also may con-
tribute to the high mean BMI (Ganguli 1999), possibly
through increased appetite or sedation, and therefore less
energy expenditure or endocrinological side effects (Acker-
man and Nolan 1998). We plan to investigate the possible
contribution of medication to weight gain in the future.
The high percentage of smokers in the study sample
(59.6%), combined with the high prevalence of obesity,
suggests that schizophrenia patients are at particular risk
of developing serious medical problems associated with
higher mortality, which has been previously noted (Simp-
son and Tsuang 1996).
Most patients in the sample reported that they were
concerned with their body weight and aware of the fact
that weight loss would be beneficial to their health. How-
ever, patients also complained about the virtual nonexis-
tence of structured weight loss programs to support their
needs. Therefore, health care providers need to develop
and implement weight management programs to help
these patients change their eating patterns, lose weight,
feel more self-confident, and most important, reduce mor-
bidity and mortality from physical health problems. How-
ever, sustained weight reduction is a challenge even in
non-psychiatrically ill individuals and may take consider-
able effort to achieve.
