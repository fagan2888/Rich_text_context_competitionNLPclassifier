In recent decades, a decline in the mortality rate in the US has
led to an increase in life expectancy. With a rapid extension of
life expectancy, the number of elderly people suffering from
dementing illnesses is escalating. Cognitive impairment and
mental diseases are among the most common morbid con-
ditions in later life. The prevalence of dementia among elderly
Americans aged 65 years is estimated to be between 5% and
10%.1­8 The number of elderly people suffering from dementia
and living in the US was estimated at 3.1 million people in
1990; this number is projected to increase 2.5- to 4-fold by the
year 2040.9
The question that arises is whether longevity is a reward.
Nobody would appreciate the added years of life if they were
accompanied by disability or dementia. In order to answer this
question, a new health indicator that takes both morbidity
and mortality into consideration has emerged.10 Healthy life
expectancy is defined as the duration an individual at a given
age is expected to live without any specific morbid condition. A
comparison of healthy life expectancies between different times
allows us to appraise the quality of increased years of life. Three
scenarios are possible. The first argues that life expectancy in-
creases faster than healthy life expectancy, thus the duration to

Trends in dementia-free life expectancy
among elderly members of a large health
maintenance organization

Background This study examined the secular trends of life expectancy without dementia
among elderly American members of a health maintenance organization, and
observed if an increased life expectancy is accompanied by an increase in the
duration of life with dementia.
Methods The data derived from two chronological 9-year prospective cohort studies of
members of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of Northern California.
The first and second cohorts included 2702 and 2926 people aged 65 years free
from dementia at baseline. Life expectancy without dementia or dementia-free
life expectancy (DemFLE) is defined as the average number of years a person
is expected to live without dementia. Total life expectancy is equal to the sum of
DemFLE and life expectancy with dementia. Estimations of DemFLE were based
on mortality data and incidence of dementia, using double-decrement life tables.
Results Between the first and second cohorts, all-cause mortality rates declined, while
the incidence of dementia remained constant in both men and women. Among
the males, total life expectancy increased at a higher rate than DemFLE. Con-
sequently, the duration of life with dementia was extended in the second cohort.
Conversely, among the females DemFLE increased at a higher rate than total life
expectancy, thus the duration of life with dementia decreased in the second cohort.
The median age of dementia onset was postponed by 2­3 years in the second
cohort for females, and did not show any specific difference between the two
cohorts in males.
Conclusion The trends of health expectancies suggest an extension of the duration of life
with dementia for males and a compression of dementia for females. A decreased
incidence of risk factors for dementia among females in the second cohort such
as stroke may explain these trends.

be spent with poor health increases. At an extreme limit, life
expectancy increases while healthy expectancy remains the
same; this figure leads to `the pandemic of mental disorders and
chronic diseases'.11 Second, a more optimistic concept implies
a stagnation in life expectancy concomitant with an increase of
healthy expectancy; this theory is known as `the compression of
morbidity'.12,13 The third pattern, called `dynamic equilibrium',
describes a stability of morbidity and health status levels, thus life
expectancy and healthy expectancy increase at the same rate.14
Dementia-free life expectancy (DemFLE) is defined as the
average number of years an individual at a given age is expected
to live without dementia. This estimation is based on mortality
data and on the prevalence or incidence of dementia. To date,
DemFLE has been estimated for European countries, Australia
and Japan.15­20 In no previous studies has DemFLE been
measured on similar populations at different periods. Thus, it
is still unknown whether an increased life expectancy is asso-
ciated with an extension or a compression of the duration to be
lived with dementia.
In the study reported here, data were derived from two
chronological cohorts of subjects aged 65 years. These subjects
were all members of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Pro-
gram of Northern California (KPMCP-NC), one of the largest
prepaid health maintenance organizations in the US.21 The
KPMCP-NC provides comprehensive medical services to more
than two million members of all ages. In order to analyse trends
in life expectancies free of dementia, two cohorts of approximately
3000 elderly subjects each were followed for 9 years. For both
cohorts in 1971 and 1980, all-cause mortality and onset of
dementia were recorded. Identical study designs and methods
were applied to each cohort. Estimations of DemFLE were based
on mortality and the incidence of dementia during the follow-
up period.
The objective of the study is to examine the changes over
time of DemFLE among two populations of elderly Americans
members of the KPMCP-NC, and to observe whether an increase
in longevity is accompanied by an increase in the duration to be
spent with dementia, i.e. a `longer life associated with worsen-
ing health'.22
Method
Data collection
The study design has been published elsewhere.23 In brief, the
data were derived from medical records of two cohorts of elderly
Americans who were members of the KPMCP-NC between
1971 and 1979, and between 1980 and 1988. Members of the
first cohort were 65 years in 1971, and those of the second
cohort were 65 years in 1980. The 1971 cohort included 2877
people, while the 1980 cohort included 3113 people. The sample
selection was stratified to attain equal numbers of observations
(1000 in each) in three sex-age cells for each cohort: 65­69,
70­79, 80 years. Outpatient records of the study subjects were
abstracted for 9 years from the baseline year (January 1971 and
January 1980).
A mortality search was performed using the California Auto-
mated Mortality Linkage (CAMLIS). The CAMLIS uses vital
statistics tapes obtained from the California Department of Health
Services to produce a weighted value that reflects the level
of probability that a subject's death and vital statistics match.
All borderline values were reviewed individually to determine
whether the match was correct. During the follow-up period,
onset of dementia, death, or withdrawal were recorded. In the
1971 and 1980 cohorts, 7.1% and 8.6% of the subjects with-
drew from the membership of KPMCP-NC before the end of the
follow-up period. Comparison of the withdrawal populations
in the two cohorts did not show any significant differences in
terms of sex, age, race, and education level.
Calculation of incidence of dementia and mortality
Incident cases of dementia were identified by chart review. The
KPMCP-NC did not perform a screening programme to detect
dementia. In order to be diagnosed as having dementia, patients
had to visit clinics. Under these circumstances, less severe cases
of dementia or cases referred directly to a nursing home could
have been missed, and thus the number of cases could be under-
estimated. Diagnosis was made by a primary care physician
when the person visited the KPMCP-NC and, in most cases, was
confirmed by a neurologist. Dementia was diagnosed according
to the International Classification of Diseases-9th revision (ICD-9)
criteria. Incident cases of dementia were defined as those
diagnosed after the baseline date. Severity of dementia was not
considered in this study since such information was not avail-
able for some cases.
Cases of dementia present at or before baseline were con-
sidered as prevalent cases. Prevalent dementia was identified by
reviewing the medical charts for 4 years before the beginning of
the follow-up period. In the first cohort, on 1 January 1971, 175
prevalent cases of dementia were identified and excluded from
the analyses; for the second cohort, on 1 January 1980, 187
prevalent cases were excluded. The 1971 cohort included 2702
subjects (males: 1320, females: 1382) who were free of dementia
at baseline, and the 1980 cohort included 2926 such subjects
(males: 1459, females: 1467).
The age- and sex-specific incidence rates of dementia and the
age- and sex-specific mortality rates during the follow-up period
were calculated with the person-years method. In the first
and second cohorts, the person-years at risk was the time from
either 1 January 1971 or 1 January 1980 to the earliest date for
incidence of dementia, death, withdrawal from KPMCP-NC, or
either to 31 December 1979 or 31 December 1988. In the 1971
cohort, 17 454 person-years were observed for the incidence of
dementia (males: 8090 person-years, females: 9364 person-
years), and in the 1980 cohort, this figure was 19 387 person-
years (males: 9306 person-years, female: 10 081 person-years).
Calculation of DemFLE and total life expectancy
For estimation of DemFLE, we performed a double-decrement
life table analysis, as proposed by Katz et al.24 The probability of
living free from dementia in the DemFLE calculations was based
on the following formula:
1px = 1 ­ 1px
d ­ 1px
dm
where:
1px = probability of living free from dementia during the
interval between age x and age x + 1
1px
d = probability of dying during the interval between age x
and age x + 1
1px
dm = probability of becoming demented during the
interval between age x and age x + 1
TRENDS IN DEMENTIA-FREE LIFE EXPECTANCY 1111
The estimations of the total life expectancy (TLE) were based on
the probability of dying, according to the following formula:
1px = 1 ­ 1px
d
where:
1px = probability of living during the interval between age x
and age x + 1
1px
d = probability of dying during the interval between age x
and age x + 1
1px
d and 1px
dm were obtained by the person-years method as
described above. The probabilities were estimated for each year
of age and each sex.
Because the observed probabilities were somewhat unsteady
due to a smaller sample size at higher ages, a smoothing method
with logistic regression was used. In this method, the observed
age-specific probabilities were fit to the exponential function:
Mx = e( +  ln x)
where Mx represents the predicted probability at age x,  and
 the regression coefficients, and ln x the natural logarithm of
age x. In the data presented here, all regression coefficients
were significant (P  0.001) and R2 of each model was between
0.84 and 0.91.
The DemFLE corresponds to the number of years a person
can expect to live without dementia. Dementia life expectancy
(DemLE) is defined as the time to be spent with dementia. The
TLE is the sum of these two durations.
A survival analysis was applied to the data. The association
between dementia onset and potential risk factors of dementia
was examined using the Cox proportional hazards regression
model. The dependent variable was the number of years from
baseline of each cohort (1971 and 1980) to the point of the
development of dementia. Independent variables included age,
sex, education level, smoking status, and prevalence of specific
medical conditions, respectively.
Results
Table 1 presents the characteristics of the study subjects accord-
ing to the cohort. Sex, age distribution, and education level
were similarly distributed in the two study populations. The
frequency of outpatient visits did not differ by cohorts. However,
Whites were significantly less represented in the second cohort
while Blacks were more numerous (2, P  0.001). Prevalence
and incidence of dementia in the 1980 cohort did not show
any significant difference between the two races (prevalence
of dementia in Whites: 6.5%, Blacks: 4%, 2 P = 0.077;
incidence of dementia in Whites: 1.8%, Blacks: 1.6%, 2
P = 0.469).
Incidence of dementia
Among the first cohort (n = 2702), 386 subjects were newly
diagnosed as having dementia. In the second cohort (n = 2926),
457 incident cases were detected during the follow-up period.
In the 1971 cohort, most of the cases were coded as non-specific
dementia (non-specific dementia: 97%, Alzheimer's dementia:
2%), while in the 1980 cohort, the percentage of Alzheimer cases
increased tenfold (non-specific dementia: 75%, Alzheimer's
dementia: 20%). Bias due to the misclassification of dementia
subtypes was prevented since all types of dementia were
included in the analyses.
The crude incidence rate of dementia in the 1971 cohort was
2.21 per 100 person-years (2.35 for males, 2.09 for females); in
the 1980 cohort, the crude rate was 2.36 (2.33 for males, 2.39
for females). The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of the 1980
cohort relative to the 1971 cohort was 1.00 for males and 1.09
for females. There was no significant difference in the incidence
rate of dementia between the two cohorts (P  0.05 in both
sexes).
Table 2 presents the age-specific incidence rates of dementia
by sex in the two cohorts. Similar rates were observed for both
sexes in the 1971 and 1980 cohorts, except for men in the age
group 70­74 years (threefold higher in the 1980 cohort) and for
women aged 85 years (1.5 times higher in the 1980 cohort).
Mortality
In the 1971 cohort, 1057 people died during the follow-up
period; and in the 1980 cohort, 1071 deaths were recorded.
Table 3 shows the age-specific mortality rates by sex in the two
cohorts.
Within a decade, men have presented a decline in mortality
rates at all ages, except after the age of 85 years in the 1980
cohort. Women also showed lower mortality rates before the
age of 85 years in the second cohort. The standardized mortality
ratio (SMR) in the second cohort relative to the first cohort,

In other words, mortality rates were significantly lower in the
second cohort for both males and females.
Health expectancies
Table 4 shows the duration of TLE, DemFLE, DemLE and the
percentage of life without dementia within the TLE on every
5-year age interval for each gender in both cohorts, and Figure 1
shows the trends of the three expectancies in both genders.
Over the decade between the 1971 and 1980 cohorts, TLE
has increased among males, especially at younger ages. In males
aged 65 years old, TLE was 16.7 years in the 1971 cohort, and
18.1 years in the 1980 cohort. After the age of 85 years, TLE in
both cohorts tended to be similar. The TLE for females younger
than 80 years did not change. For females aged 65 years, TLE
was 21.1 years in the first cohort and 21.5 in the second cohort.
After the age of 75 years, TLE in the second cohort tended to be
lower than in the first cohort.
As compared with the 1971 cohort, DemFLE in the 1980
cohort increased in both males and females at younger ages.
At 65 years old, men in the first cohort presented a DemFLE of
15.9 years, while in the second cohort at the same age, DemFLE

cohort was longer than TLE itself for the same age in the first
cohort. Women aged of 65 years in the first cohort had a
DemFLE of 18.8 years, and in the second cohort a DemFLE of
19.6 years. After 80 years old, in both sexes, DemFLE in the
1971 and 1980 cohorts did not change.
As shown in Figure 1 for males, trends of DemFLE in the
second cohort and TLE in the first cohort overlapped. Within a
decade, the DemFLE of the 1980 cohort reached the duration of
TLE of the 1971 cohort.
The percentage of life free from dementia within the total life
(% DemFLE) decreased between the two cohorts among males,

1971 cohort, DemFLE represented 95% of the TLE, and 93% in
the 1980 cohort. For females at the same age in the first cohort,
DemFLE represented 89% of the TLE, and in the second cohort
91%.
Between the 1971 and 1980 cohorts, the duration of life with
dementia presented an opposite trend between both genders:
increasing in men and decreasing in women. For men aged 65
years in the first cohort, DemLE was 0.8 years, and in the
second cohort DemLE reached 1.2 years. For women at 65 years
old in the 1971 cohort, DemLE was 2.3 years, this duration
decreased to 1.8 years in the 1980 cohort.
Age of dementia onset
The median age of dementia onset for each year of follow-up
according to sex and cohort is presented in Figure 2.
Because the age composition of the cohorts varied every year,
a comparison of the onset age for each year of follow-up is more
accurate than a comparison of the summarized onset age of
the whole cohort. If TLE remains constant with time, a delay
of the onset age observed in the second cohort is an indirect
indicator of a compression of morbidity. Among males, no
specific trend was noticed: a constant or delayed age of onset
was observed for some years of follow-up, as well as an earlier
age of onset in the second cohort for some other years. For

females, the median age of dementia onset was postponed by
2­3 years.
When examining the relation between potential predictors
of dementia and dementia onset with the Cox proportional
hazards model using older age group, low education level, and
presence of specific medical conditions as the reference category
(Table 5), we found that the absence of medical history of stroke
increased significantly the number of years free from dementia
(relative hazard [RH] = 1.30, P = 0.0083 in the 1971 cohort;
RH = 1.21, P = 0.0269 in the 1980 cohort). A significant relation
was also observed between dementia onset and the absence
of cardiovascular disease in the second cohort (RH = 1.09,
P = 0.0478). However, when adjusting for sex and age, the
significance with cardiovascular disease disappeared (RH = 1.06,
P = 0.1529). The other variables such as younger age, being
male, having a high education level, being free from hypertension,
or diabetes mellitus, or Parkinson's disease, or depression,
respectively, did not show any significant relation with the age
of dementia onset in one or both cohorts.
Discussion
This paper presents chronological series of life expectancies
without dementia among elderly Americans. Estimates of TLE
and DemFLE were based on the longitudinal observation of two
cohorts of elderly members of the same health maintenance
organization. Trends in life expectancy and health expectancy
over a 9-year period were examined. The results indicated that
trends of increase in TLE and in DemFLE were quite different
between the genders. The DemFLE increased at a slower rate
than life expectancy among males. Consequently, DemLE in-
creased in the second cohort and the %DemFLE decreased in the

1980 cohort. Conversely, for females, with a faster progression
rate of DemFLE compared to TLE, the %DemFLE improved and
the duration with dementia decreased in the second cohort.
Before interpreting the findings, we should point out the three
major limitations of this study. First, while the two cohorts were
similar in terms of sex and age distribution, education level and
frequency of outpatient visits, they differed in terms of race. The
second cohort included less White subjects but more Black
elderly. Differences in the dementia prevalence due to race are
controversial. One study has reported a higher prevalence of
dementia among Blacks,25 while two others showed no differ-
ence.26,27 Studies on race and incidence of dementia are scarce.
The present report is consistent with a recent survey which
found no significant difference in the incidence of dementia
between the two races.27 Consequently, we may assume that
the difference in the race distribution between the 1971 and the
1980 cohorts has not biased the comparison over time of the
DemFLE.
Second, in the KPMCP-NC, the mental status of the members
was not routinely screened. The members had to visit the clinics
in order to receive a dementia diagnosis. Some patients would
be unable or reluctant to visit when their mental status declined;
also, some cases would have been referred directly to nursing
homes or kept at home without a diagnostic evaluation. Under
these circumstances, some of the dementia cases would have
been missed and, therefore, the incidence rate may have been
underestimated. As we will describe later, however, the incid-
ence of dementia in the populations we studied was consistent
with those of two previous population-based studies among
elderly Americans.28,29
Third, the attitude of both physicians and patients to dementia
has changed over the decades; consequently, these changes may
have affected the estimate of the rate of incidence of dementia.
Diagnostic practices have varied between the 1970s and the
1980s. During the 1980s, the diagnostic criteria of dementia were
established internationally and the definition of senile dementia
appeared in DSM-III and ICD-9.30 Moreover, the development
of standardized diagnostic interviews and mental examinations
has improved the detection of dementing illnesses. The use of
computer tomography scans and other imaging tools has in-
creased dramatically between the two cohorts.23 Improvements
in the detection of Alzheimer's dementia are reflected in the
dementia distribution among each cohort.31 Moreover, physicians
have become more inclined to tell the patient and his/her
family the true diagnosis. In addition, families of demented
elderly patients are more aware of dementing illnesses, and seek
greater medical and social support. These changes in physicians'
and patients' attitudes may have resulted in increased number
of diagnosis of dementia. However, the present data showed
that the incidence of dementia did not change throughout the
study period 1971­1988.
The strength of the present study lies in the utilization of the
same method among comparable populations. The calculation
methods used in the 1971 and 1980 cohorts were identical, taking
into consideration the incidence of dementia and mortality at
the same time.
The incidence of dementia in these two cohorts was consist-
ent with the results of two previous reports of population-based
studies in the US. Both studies showed higher incidence rate with
older age. In the Rochester study, incidence rates increased from
0.13 per 100 person-years for the age group 60­69 years to 2.18
for the elderly aged 80 years.29 In the Framingham study, the
rates were lower than in the present report because the severity
of dementia was restricted to moderate and severe cases.28
Between the first and the second cohorts, mortality decreased,
especially among the males, while the incidence of dementia
remained constant among both genders. Trends of increase in
TLE and DemFLE were quite different between the two sexes.
For males, although both TLE and DemFLE increased, the degree
of increase was more remarkable in the former than in the latter.
As a result, the duration to be spent with dementia or DemLE
was prolonged and an extension of morbidity took place among
the males. For females at younger ages, DemFLE increased by
about one year under the relatively constant TLE. Thus, com-
pression of morbidity was observed among females under 80
years of age. Women in their eighties presented a plateau in
DemFLE; while women aged 85 years and over showed a
decrease in both TLE and DemFLE, supporting an equilibrium.
However, estimations for the oldest ages should be considered
with the utmost caution since the probabilities of death and
dementia in the life table were predicted by a logistic regression
model according to the relationship between these events and
age. The discrepancy between the actual value and the pre-
dicted value increases with age, thus the estimate becomes less
reliable at older ages.
The results of the present study indicate that, especially among
females, DemFLE has grown in spite of a constant incidence rate
of dementia. This fact could be explained by a postponement
of dementia onset. In order to corroborate this trend, we have
calculated the median age of dementia onset for each year of
follow-up and have compared the results between both cohorts.
Males did not show any specific trend but the median age of
dementia onset was postponed by 2­3 years among females
in the second cohort. The compression of morbidity among
females was confirmed by the postponement of the median age
of dementia onset in the 1980 cohort.
A previous report on the same population has shown
decreased incidence rates of stroke for females in the second
cohort; while males up to 75 years of age presented increased
rates.23 A decreased incidence rate of stroke, one of the risk
factors for vascular dementia, may account for a later onset of
dementia and partly explain the sex difference observed.
The gender difference in the trends of DemFLE suggests to
us that sex-related factors may account for the risk and pre-
vention of dementia. According to previous studies, oestrogen
use by post-menopausal women may postpone and decrease
the risk of Alzheimer's dementia.32,33 However, the use of oestro-
gen in these two age/time cohorts is low. Moreover, the effect
of oestrogen replacement therapy on the risk of Alzheimer's
disease needs to be fully explored, since the results are still
controversial.34,35
In line with previous studies on active life expectancy which
reported a pandemic of disabilities,36,37 the present report shows,
despite a stable incidence of dementia within a decade, a similar
trend for dementia among men (i.e. an extension of the
duration of life spent with dementia). A less pessimistic trend is
observed among women, supporting a compression of dementia
associated with a constant dementia incidence. The results
suggest that in women of the present cohorts, the onset of
dementia is delayed, although it is not fully prevented.
