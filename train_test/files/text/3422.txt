Introduction
The environment of an all-boys school involves a complex
mix of cultures. Some of the most interesting surround mas-
culine attitudes to subjects such as sport, and these can be
contrasted with a subject such as music, where perceptions
of the importance and usefulness of the subject can be dis-
tinctly different. The pressure to conform to gender-role ste-
reotypes intensifies during adolescence, often influencing
the individual's choice of involvement in activities perceived
as appropriate to their own gender (Wigfield & Eccles,
1994). In fact, Hallam, Rogers, and Creech (2008) suggested
that stereotyping "may be an inhibitory factor for boys, who
may come under great pressure from peers if they engage in
any activity that is seen as `feminine'" (p. 15). Females are
often reported as enjoying their musical participation,
whereas boys cite bad experiences with a teacher as being a
significant reason for why they do not enjoy the subject
(Turton & Durrant, 2002).
Collins (2012) described the adolescent male ecosystem
as a complex and delicate balance of messages and experi-
ences that can profoundly affect boys' attitude of being
involved in musical activities. Within this explanation, three
essential needs must be satisfied to maintain boys' interest
and motivation for music: interest and positive attitude, suc-
cess and accomplishment, and acceptance and praise. If any
one of these areas is influenced by negative messages or
experiences, then motivation for involvement in musical
activities may be impeded. In contrast to music, research
indicates that sport competence is highly valued by boys,
where the status and popularity of a sport can affect the way
a boy feels he is perceived within his particular peer group
(Ridgers, Fazey, & Faircloth, 2007).
In Western societies, adolescents report spending an aver-
age of 75 min each day listening to music, with most pos-
sessing a portable listening system to regulate their personal
and social lives (Rideout & Roberts, 2010). Despite the huge
rates of consumption of music, studies across different coun-
tries and regions of the world show a consistent trend, indi-
cating that the general population of school students value
music less as compared with sport and other so-called

Facilitators and Impediments for Elective
Music and Sport in Adolescent Males
Simone Waters1, Gary E. McPherson2, and Emery Schubert1
Abstract
Within the culture of an all-male private school, sport often holds a special status as compared with music. As an area of
learning and participation, sport is typically associated with masculinity and receives broad social acceptance, whereas music
is often seen at the margins of the curriculum and considered as an activity for a select few who are innately talented. Because
of these perceptions, participation rates for males are often higher for sport than they are for music. With this as our
context, this study examined differences between the two elective subjects of music and sport, by seeking to investigate boys'
motivation to choose whether or not to elect music and sport in the final years of high school. The study utilized an online
survey that was completed by 293 subjects (13 to 16 years old, school years 8 to 10). Results indicate that the boys were
more motivated to select elective sport rather than music (42.7% vs. 4.8%, respectively), with 49.8% choosing neither music
nor sport. A comparison of facilitators of elective music and sport revealed similarities across the two domains, with interest
in the subject (music or sport) receiving the highest mean rating for elective facilitation. Seven of the nine impediment scales
were significantly higher for music (only importance of the subject and parental influence were statistically identical across
sport and music). The study is the first of which we are aware that directly compares music and sport as school subjects, and
as such, offers insight into the different motivational forces that act to either facilitate or impede students' choice of these
subjects within an all-male private school.

academic subjects such as math, mother tongue, and science
(McPherson & O'Neill, 2010). Given the personal and social
significance of music and sport in adolescent males' daily
lives, it is noteworthy that music is regarded as being less
useful and important for one's future career and as a subject
that is seen to add value to one's education when compared
with academic subjects (McPherson & O'Neill, 2010;
Renwick & Reeve, 2012; Sulz, Humbert, Gyurcsik, Chad, &
Gibbons, 2010).
While choice of elective subjects can signify motivation,
there is limited research into the factors that influence choice
of elective subjects at high school (Ferrer-Caja & Weiss,
2000; Sulz et al., 2010), and in particular males (Sulz et al.,
2010). This is surprising because subject selection has a pro-
found effect on the lives of adolescents beyond their school
years, and is a major determinant of future career
aspirations.
Drawing on motivational theories considered to be help-
ful for understanding subject choice, the purpose of this arti-
cle, therefore, was to examine high school student attributions
for the selection or non-selection of music and sport. The
study adopted a survey that explicitly examined reasons for
subject selection, compared sport with music, and sought to
clarify reasons that facilitate selection versus reasons that
impede selection of each subject by adolescent males.
Subject Choice
Three main conceptual frameworks have been devised that
examine influences on adolescent elective decisions. From
an Ecological conception, emphasis is given to the impor-
tance of individual factors such as the individual's level of
confidence and social factors such as significant family
members, peers, and friends (Sulz et al., 2010). Similarly,
Self-Determination theory highlights the individual's need
for autonomy and competence, and social relatedness and
support (Ryan & Deci, 2000), whereas Expectancy-Value
model emphasizes the individual's expectations and goals, as
well as the social factors which shape the individual's values
and beliefs (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000).
Ecological Theory
Using the ecological perspective, research has examined
sport participation (Allison et al., 2005) and factors that
influence elective enrollment (Gyurcsik, Spink, Bray, Chad,
& Kwan, 2006; Luke & Sinclair, 1991; Sulz et al., 2010) by
focusing on individual and social environmental causes of
behavior. Typically, researchers study influences on adoles-
cent elective sport enrollment by examining individual (past
experiences, self-efficacy, class schedule, knowledge of the
course) and social environmental (attitude of significant oth-
ers such as parents and teachers, course curriculum, commu-
nity activities) influences for electing the subject in schools
(Sulz et al., 2010). Overall, facilitators for both male and
female enrollment are influenced by both individual and
social factors. The important difference is that impediments
to male elective enrollment are influenced by social environ-
mental factors whereas impediments for females are influ-
enced by individual and social environmental factors (Allison
et al., 2005; Gyurcsik et al., 2006).
Luke and Sinclair's (1991) investigation into facilitators
and barriers for elective sport found predominantly social
environmental (including curriculum content and teacher
behavior) influences to be the most important, and these
accounted for 58.8% of the facilitator statements and 71.46%
of the barrier statements (Luke & Sinclair, 1991). Unlike
Sulz et al. (2010), Luke and Sinclair (1991) found facilitators
and barriers to be similar. They ranked from greatest to least
influence, curriculum content, teacher behavior, class atmo-
sphere and students' self-perception, and facilities (Luke &
Sinclair, 1991). Despite investigating male and female par-
ticipants, this study does not report gender distinctions, and
limits the investigation to students in senior high school
(Grade 11 only). However, students are faced with elective
decisions prior to Year 11; hence, the current study furthers
the Luke and Sinclair paper by focusing on the years in
which elective decisions are most pertinent (i.e., Years 8, 9,
and 10), and by comparing factors across more than one
domain (music and sport).
Although research into factors that facilitate or impede
elective enrollment in sport is limited (Ferrer-Caja & Weiss,
2000; Sulz et al., 2010), what is known is that both individual
and social environmental factors play an important role in
adolescent elective decisions. To date, these types of ecologi-
cal sport studies have not been conducted in the music
domain, nor are there any studies which compare possible
differences between the two subjects.
Self-Determination Theory
Self-determination theory is a meta-theory that includes
issues that are related to Planned Behavior and Basic Needs.
Planned Behavior perspectives posit that behavioral inten-
tion is influenced by the individuals' attitudes toward the
subject, social support, and perceived autonomy support,
each of which is useful for examining influences for adoles-
cents' selection of elective subjects such as music and sport
(Shen, 2010). Similarly, Basic Needs research within this
paradigm suggests that the psychological needs of compe-
tence, relatedness, and autonomy are the fuel for internaliza-
tion and optimal motivation (Deci & Ryan, 2002). Evans,
McPherson, and Davidson (2013) found the Basic Needs to
be a robust framework for investigating adolescent music
engagement and claims the fulfillment of basic psychologi-
cal needs (competence, relatedness, and autonomy) is vital
for ongoing involvement in musical activities. This line of
research shows that students are more likely to cease involve-
ment in music making when these needs are not met. Like
the ecological framework, both Planned Behavior and Basic
Waters et al. 3
Needs perspectives not only emphasize the individual and
social components influencing choice but also highlight the
autonomous learning environment (facilitating choice, con-
trol, and responsibility to the learner) for promoting motiva-
tion and future enrollment.The literature of Planned Behavior
and Basic Needs remains primarily focused on individual
and social issues related to elective subject selection.
Research using this theoretical framework indicates that
most senior high school students make subject choices with-
out adequate advice or planning, which in turn fails to maxi-
mize their future opportunities for elective subject choices
(Warton, 1997a; 1997b; Warton & Cooney, 1997). Other
research (Eccles, 2005) shows that adolescents limit their
range of subject choice with inaccurate information and fail
to consider long-term goals (Eccles, 2005; Siann, Lightbody,
Nicholson, Louise, & Dave, 1988). For example, Siann
et al.'s (1988) investigation of subject choices for Chinese
secondary students identified two main influences on these
decisions: whether they liked the subject or not and because
they were required to make a choice between subjects
(imposed either by school framework or by eliminating less
desirable options). While these studies provide valuable
insight into factors influencing subject selection, they focus
on the overall process of subject selection rather than influ-
ences within specific domains.
Expectancy-Value Theory
The Wigfield and Eccles (2000) Expectancy-Value theory
combines the motivational components of competency
beliefs, importance of subject, and utilitarian beliefs, and
focuses on both the role of students' beliefs about their own
competence and the value they place on the activity.Applying
this framework, McCormick and McPherson (2007) have
shown how the achievement in an upcoming examination of
instrumental music learners can be predicted by the value
they place on their musical participation, and the perceptions
they have of their own abilities. Furthermore, this line of
research suggests that the students' subjective task values
(including importance, interest, and usefulness) are most
influential in subject choice decisions (Austin, Renwick, &
McPherson, 2006; McPherson, Davidson, & Faulkner, 2012;
O'Neill, 2012; Renwick & Reeve, 2012; Schunk, Pintrich, &
Meece, 2010; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000).
Importance and Value
When students perceive a particular subject area to be impor-
tant and valuable, they are more motivated to pursue further
study in that domain (McPherson & O'Neill, 2010; O'Neill,
2012; Schunk et al., 2010; Sichivitsa, 2007; Simpkins, Vest,
& Becnel, 2010). O'Neill (2012) claimed that "the positive
valuing of music participation is one of the most important
reasons why young people choose to continue with music
learning" (p. 175). Wheeler's (2011) study on sport found
that parents who valued sport influenced their children's
value of sport and that the transmission of the sporting cul-
ture influenced children's long-term motivation and partici-
pation. However, during adolescence, there is an overall
decline in value beliefs (Hidi & Ainley, 2002; McPherson &
O'Neill, 2010; Schunk et al., 2010), such that when academic
activities are not valued or seen as important, students are
de-motivated for learning.
Literature on music suggests that the marked decline in
motivation during adolescence is due to a belief that ability
is essentially innate (Austin et al., 2006; Hargreaves,
MacDonald, & Miell, 2012; McPherson & O'Neill, 2010;
McPherson et al., 2012); and therefore that no amount of
effort will change one's innate capabilities. This misconcep-
tion has been refuted by many academics including
McPherson and Williamon (2006), Sloboda and Davidson
(1996), and McPherson et al. (2012), who place a much
greater emphasis on environmental aspects of skill develop-
ment, and especially the development of a healthy motiva-
tional profile in the pursuit of personal goals associated with
skill development. It is self-evident that struggling learners
who consider music ability to be an inherited or fixed trait
that is beyond their control will be less likely to value music
activities and invest sufficient effort and time into develop-
ing skills. Consequently, it is children's beliefs about their
musical competence that determine their commitment level
to musical learning such that music learners who sustain an
"incremental and multifaceted view of music ability" are
most likely to both value and maintain motivation for learn-
ing music (Austin et al., 2006, p. 231).
Interest
A learner's interest in a subject also predicts activity choices
across a variety of domains including maths, music, and
sport (Fredericks & Eccles, 2002; Simpkins et al., 2010).
Research by Hidi andAinley (2002), and Hidi and Renninger
(2006) indicates that there are differences in interest across
domains. In particular, Wigfield (1994) found that during
elementary school interest in school music declines, in con-
trast to school sport which does not. However, as students
progress into high school, overall adolescents are much more
interested in non-academic activities than school-based aca-
demic activities.
Utility Value
Adolescent elective choice is also influenced by the utility
value individuals place on each subject. Utilitarian value is
determined by future goals, career aspirations, capacity to
earn a good income, and acceptance into tertiary education
(Renwick & Reeve, 2012). As students begin to focus on
long-term goals, parental pressure relating to vocational
opportunities and potential earning capacity can unduly
influence adolescent subject choice (McPherson et al., 2012).
4 SAGE Open
The "arts" subjects (music, dance, drama, and art) are often
considered less important for daily life and employment than
the more "academic" subjects (English, maths, science;
McPherson & O'Neill, 2010) with the result that the more
"academic" subjects are elected in preference to subjects
such as music and art.
Self-Efficacy
Self-efficacy studies seek to understand how individual's
beliefs about their ability to plan and perform particular
tasks affect how they complete those tasks as they strive to
reach their own personal goals (Renwick & Reeve, 2012).
Positive self-efficacy leads to higher levels of concentration,
control, involvement, satisfaction, and motivation for learn-
ing (Bassi, Steca, & Caprara, 2007), while also promoting
task choice, motivation, achievement, sustained effort, and
persistence (Bandura, 1986; Schunk et al., 2010). Across a
range of school subjects, including music and sport, studies
have found that elective enrollment decisions are strongly
influenced by self-efficacy (Cetinkapl & Turksoy, 2011;
McCormick & McPherson, 2003; McPherson & McCormick,
2006; Sulz et al., 2010). McPherson and O'Neill's (2010)
study found that adolescent subject choices are influenced by
their expectations of success and the personal value of each
subject. Overall, research indicates that self-efficacy signifi-
cantly influences adolescent subject selection, with students
more likely to engage in activities they feel competent in and
value (McPherson et al., 2012; O'Neill & McPherson, 2002;
Sullivan & Strode, 2010).
Aim of the Study
The review of the literature supports the assertions presented
by McPherson and Hallam (2009) that there are complex
relationships between motivational influences and subject
selection However, most of the factors that influence adoles-
cent choice of elective subjects can be categorized according
to an individual component (autonomy, utility, competency
beliefs, intrinsic interest and enjoyment, importance, and
self-efficacy) or a social environmental component (peers,
teacher, family, and access and utilization of career informa-
tion). Studies that compare both reasons that facilitate and
reasons that impede elective choice across more than one
subject directly such as sport and music are lacking. Such an
approach would have the benefit of identifying whether any
of the motivational factors for one subject are dominant rela-
tive to another. For example, if sport is chosen as an elective
subject because it is rated as having high competence value,
is that value higher than for music? Furthermore, are the rea-
sons for choosing a subject symmetrical with the reasons for
not choosing? For example, are students who have friends
doing music as likely to choose music as an elective as stu-
dents lacking friends in music would choose not to?
The central interest of this study was to compare items
drawn from the research that act either to facilitate or to
impede the selection of music and sport during the final years
of high school. For this reason, we chose to restrict our anal-
ysis to specific motivational constructs within the three theo-
retical perspectives mentioned previously that we considered
would best enable us to focus on this issue. The survey
instrument therefore did not seek to confirm or explore
underlying dimensions of any single theory.
The items we selected, and the nominal theories and
dimensions to which they belong are listed in Table 1. As a
result of our literature review, the study was confined to
those items reflected in the research surveyed earlier.
Furthermore, the study used a small selection of items (to
avoid subject fatigue), while representing the broad range of
motivational frameworks described in the literature review.
This present study therefore investigated
1. Reasons for choice (RFC) of music or sport electives
(facilitators).
2. Reasons for non-choice of music or sport electives
(impediments).
It was anticipated that an examination of these reasons
for subject selection would help clarify understandings of
adolescent motivation from a perspective not commonly
currently found in the literature. We chose to examine a
boys school because issues surrounding subject selection
for music and sport are particularly intense in this type of
setting. Unlike music, sport is firmly established in the
ethos and traditions of this particular school and has been
regarded as a valued activity for students in every grade
leading up to the last year of high school. In fact, it is com-
pulsory for all boys to participate in at least one sport until
their final 2 years of high school. Therefore, exploring this
particular setting in which perceptions are firmly encultur-
ated can offer valuable insight into motivation for sport
and music. Hence, the present study focused on reasons for
elective choice by male high school students. We were par-
ticularly keen to determine whether facilitators and imped-
iments were the same for music and sport. Furthermore,
we tested whether reasons for doing an activity (when the
question is posed as a facilitator of the chosen activity)
corresponds to the reasons for not doing that activity (when
the question is posed as a barrier for the activity not
chosen).
Method
Participants
Participants from a private boys school in Sydney, Australia,
were invited to participate in a survey. Students (N = 293)
ranged in age from 13 to 16 years (Years 8, 9, 10). The issue
of subject selection is most pertinent for students in Years 8,
9, and 10 when students form judgments about whether they
will elect these subjects in subsequent years; hence, this
analysis has been limited to students in those years.
Waters et al. 5
The school provides a large range of academic subjects to
cater for a breadth of student abilities and interests. Students
entering Stage 5 (Years 9 and 10, age 14-15) at the school
must select two elective subjects in total: one from each of
the following two strands for 200 hr of study:
Elective 1: commerce, drama, French, German, graphics
technology, industrial technology (wood), Japanese,
music, visual arts, literacy.
Elective 2: commerce, design and technology, drama,
French, industrial technology (metal), industrial technol-
ogy (wood), Latin, literacy, music, visual arts.
Each of these courses offers a curriculum that integrates
practical and theoretical components of each subject. In the
case of music, the learning experiences included performing,
composing, and listening to music in a range of styles, peri-
ods, and genres (including a mandatory topic on Australian
music).
Currently, all students in Stage 5 (Years 9 and 10) are
required to participate in sport training on 2 weekday after-
noons, as well as a match each Saturday. Summer sport
activities that students in Stage 5 can choose include cricket,
rowing, rugby, tennis, basketball, surf life saving, rock-
climbing, swimming, and athletics. Winter sport activities
include rugby, soccer, cross-country, tennis, and athletics.
Underpinning the schools philosophy is the notion that
students can learn a great deal about life from mandated
involvement in sport. In contrast, both music and drama
activities are encouraged, in and outside the classroom with
the school having a long tradition of vocal and instrumental
groups and annual productions of various kinds. Both sport
and music can be chosen as an elective subject in the final
years of schooling (i.e., Years 11 and 12).
Students entering Stage 6 (Years 11 and 12, age 16-17) at
the school must select five elective subjects in total. English
and Christian studies are mandatory subjects. Students may
choose electives from the following subjects: ancient history,
biology, business studies, chemistry, drama, economics,
English extension, extension maths, geography, German,
information technology, modern history, physical develop-
ment health physical education (PDHPE). In addition, it is
compulsory for students in Stage 6 to participate in sport.
This includes training twice mid-week and a match against
other Great Public Schools (GPS) on Saturday.
All students enrolled in elective music must participate in
at least one extra-curricular ensemble. There is a wide range
of ensembles for students to be involved, which include
Junior Band, Intermediate Concert Band, Senior Concert
Band, Jazz Band, Intermediate String Ensemble, Senior
String Ensemble, Symphony Orchestra, Chapel choir, a
capella choir, percussion ensemble, and guitar ensemble. In
addition to these ensembles, students can be involved in the
annual school musical and end of semester concerts.
The study was conducted near the end of the academic
year when participants had already chosen their subjects for

the following year. The total number of online survey partici-
pants for the purpose of this study is N = 293. A multivariate
test found no significant difference between the year groups
surveyed; hence, results are collapsed across the year of
study.
Procedure and Materials
Participants started by indicating whether they had elected to
study music and sport for the following year. Following on
from this response, they were asked to provide reasons for
(facilitators) and against (impediments) choosing music and
sport as elective subjects by rating nine items from 1 (strongly
disagree) to 11 (strongly agree; see Table 1 for details of the
nine items): interest, important subject, parent influence,
continue after school, good at subject, like the teacher,
friends involvement, enjoy theory, and interest in history.
Following institutional ethical approval and parent con-
sent, the survey was initially piloted with a small number of
other participants, and this resulted in some minor adjust-
ments to the wording of questions that made the survey eas-
ier to read and understand. The online Activities I Like to Do
at School (ALDAS) survey data, which took approximately
15 min to complete, were collected at school with surveys
being self-administered online in computer laboratories that
were supervised by several staff members.
The survey was presented in two orders to achieve coun-
terbalancing, with half of the participants answering the
music questions first and the other half answering the sport
questions first. Participants identified reasons for involve-
ment in music and sport activities, and reasons for and
against choice of elective study of music and sport. The sur-
vey contained a conditional branch that depended on whether
the subject (music or sport) was chosen (or was going to be
chosen) as an elective. Those who answered "yes" branched
to the facilitator questions and those who answered "no"
branched to the impediment questions. Impediment ques-
tions were worded identically to the facilitator questions,
with the inclusion of the "not/do not" at the grammatically
appropriate location (see Table 2). For example, the facilita-
tor item "My friends are doing it" had a matching impedi-
ment item "My friends are not doing it." A sample of the
items used in the survey is shown in Figure 1.
Results
Of the 293 participants, 14 participants (4.8%) chose only
music as an elective subject, 125 (42.7%) chose sport as an
elective, 8 (2.7%) chose music and sport elective, and 146
(49.8%) chose neither music nor sport. Table 2 presents a
cross-tabulation of the participants who fell into each cell of
the two variables (music/sport and elective chosen/elective
not chosen).

Note. Participants were offered the option of a neutral response at the mid-scale point of 5: neither agree or disagree. A "does not apply option" was not
offered in the checklist. The items that the students were asked to rank focused primarily on individual items, and are shown in Figure 1.
Waters et al. 7
A MANOVA was conducted with the nine music- and
nine sport-related items as the dependent variables with an
independent variable order of presentation (music questions
first or sport questions first). This was found to be not sig-
nificant, F(18, 244) = 1.202, p = .259, 
p
2
= .076, and so we
concluded that the order of questions did not significantly
influence or bias the responses.
Because a priori control of a mixed-design ANOVA with
regard to the subject (music or sport) and choice (facilitator
or impediment) was not possible (both variables subject to
between- and/or within-subject variation), and due to the
complexities of such a design upon parametric within-
subject design (Keselman, Algina, & Kowalchuk, 2001), our
analyses used a between-subjects design to allow a more
conservative analysis (Kantowitz, Roediger, & Elmes, 2008).
Figures 2 and 3 provide bar charts with 1 SE error bars and
an indication of the items that were significantly different
between sport and music subjects.
Elective Facilitators
Using the facilitator data (a "yes" response to item "I will
choose/have chosen as an elective"), a MANOVA using
Pillai's Trace with RFC items as dependent variables, music
versus sport as the independent variable demonstrated sig-
nificant difference between music and sport elective facilita-
tors, F(9, 149) = 2.712, p = .006, 
p
2 = .141. Levene's test for
equality of variance was statistically significant for five
(interest in subject, good at subject, friends involved, enjoy
theory, interest in history--we exercise caution in interpret-
ing the parametric analysis of these responses--see Glass,
1966, out of nine scale items at p = .05). Of the RFC items
tested, overall reasons for choosing sport were significantly
higher than music; sport (M = 7.99, SD = 2.685), music (M =
6.17, SD = 3.761). Follow-up ANOVA was used to investi-
gate which RFC items rated sport higher than music. Only
one item was significant: Enjoy learning sport theory was
rated higher than enjoy learning music theory, F(1, 157) =
8.193, p = .005, 
p
2
= .050.
Factors for facilitating elective music and sport were
fairly similar across the two domains. Interest was the most
important reason for facilitating elective music (M = 9.58,
SD = 2.302) and sport (M = 10.06, SD = 1.86); mean (SD) of
9.58 (2.302) and 10.06 (1.86), respectively, on a scale of 1 to
11 (see Table 3), followed by important subject, continue
after school, good at subject, and like teacher. The least influ-
ential item for both music and sport was parent influence,
which fell below the midpoint of the scale (6) for both sub-
jects (5.17 [3.253] and 4.85 [2.986], respectively). While the
item scale was labeled from 0 to 10 for the participant, this
was converted to a 1 to 11 scale for analysis.
Elective Impediments
Using the barriers data, a MANOVA using Pillai's Trace with
RFC items as dependent variables, music versus sport as the
independent variable demonstrated significant difference
between music and sport barriers with Pillai's Trace, F(9,

involvement, enjoy theory, and interest in history. A sum-
mary of results for each facilitator and impediment item is
reported in Tables 3 and 4 showing descriptive and inferen-
tial statistics for each item.
The main (highest mean) impediment to sport was
the item "unimportant subject" (7.25 [2.939]). All other
items were rated at or below the scale midpoint (6). Music
impediments, however, were above the scale midpoint for
every item apart from parent influence (3.95 [2.905]) and
friends not involved (5.93 [3.445]).
Further examination of the sport­music comparisons
revealed generally small effect sizes. The only items that had
moderate effect sizes (according to the

the impediments, with Not Continuing After School and
Don't Like Teacher showing highest value effect size, with

for sport. Importantly, participants reported that the influ-
ence of parents was not significant as a facilitator or impedi-
ment across both music and sport domains.Asummary of the

Discussion
Facilitators and Impediments
As shown in Table 4, all items with the exception of parents,
and for music only the enjoyment of theory, were reported as
significant facilitators for students' choice to elect music and
sport. In contrast, differences between music and sport were
much more stark for the reported impediments. For music,
all impediments were significantly higher than for sport,
except for the parents item. For sport, the only reported
impediment that was higher than for music was the item per-
ceived importance of the subject, although the differences
were not statistically significant.
The moderate effect size of the two impediments, Not
Continuing After School and Don't Like Teacher, supports
earlier research by Sulz et al. (2010) that employed an eco-
logical framework and identified both the usefulness of the
subject to students' future (an individual component) and the
influence of teachers (a social environment) as influential
barriers to elective enrollment. Furthermore, supporting the
Expectancy-Value model, which emphasizes the individual's
utilitarian beliefs and value they place on a particular activ-
ity, and the Basic Needs Theory's emphasis on the psycho-
logical need for relatedness, these impediment results reflect
aspects of each of the three main theoretical perspectives
presented in the literature review (Ecological, Self-
Determination, and Expectancy-Value theories). The fact
that these impediments were stronger for music than for
sport may be indicative of an overall lack of motivation for
music as compared with sport.
Interestingly, the least important facilitator and impedi-
ment reported for both music and sport was parental influ-
ence. Despite the large amount of evidence indicating the
important role parents play in motivation and learning
(McPherson, 2009; McPherson et al., 2012; Schunk et al.,
2010; Sichivitsa, 2007; Ullrich-French & Smith, 2009;
Wheeler, 2011), research also indicates that adolescents use
music and sport as tools for establishing independence and
their own identity (Blomfield & Barber, 2011; Hargreaves et
al., 2012; Lamont, Hargreaves, Marshall, & Tarrant, 2003;

Hargreaves, 2002; Wigfield & Tonks, 2002; Woody &
McPherson, 2010). Thus, when choosing elective subjects at
school, students at the age surveyed may perceive that they
are influenced more by their own interests, competency
beliefs, peers, and teachers, than by their parents. Overall,
our findings suggest that the highest facilitators and impedi-
ments for elective choice are more individual-oriented than
social-environment-oriented. This finding supports the Self-
Determination theory view that adolescent motivation is
most powerful when it is self-determined and intrinsic rather
than teacher or parent-directed.
It is interesting to note that responses for facilitators are
not symmetric for like items across conditions (facilitator vs.
impediment), suggesting that the significance of an item
depends on whether the subject is or is not selected. For
example, high interest is an important facilitator for elective
choice, yet high lack of interest is not as much of an
impediment.
Music and Sport Elective Choice
Results indicate that the male adolescent participants sam-
pled are more interested in enrolling in elective sport than in
music, with 42.7% choosing elective sport and only 4.8%
choosing music. Yet, almost half of the participants (49.8%)
did not choose music or sport as one of their school subjects.
Of the RFC items tested, reasons for choosing sport items
were rated significantly higher overall than for music. This
finding is in accord with McPherson and O'Neill's study,
which reported that students perceive they were less capable
in music and valued music less than other subjects
(McPherson & O'Neill, 2010). Results from the current
study are also consistent with the Simpkins et al.'s (2010)
study, which reported that males were more motivated to par-
ticipate in sport than in music. In agreement with Schunk
et al.'s (2010) finding, students report valuing tasks they
expect to succeed in, and think that the most important tasks
are those they expect to do well in. The significance of the
results for importance of subject, interest in subject, and
wanting to continue after leaving school is indicative of
deeply rooted beliefs surrounding the value of music educa-
tion at school. Values shape the way we approach learning
and influence decisions about continuing to study subjects
when given the choice. Through an enhanced understanding
of the value and importance of an activity, students are more
likely to be more motivated and engaged in learning beyond
the school realm. We therefore propose that if music educa-
tors are seeking to address low student enrollment in elective
music, there is a need to encourage students (and parents) to
become more reflective about the usefulness and importance
of studying music: "Skills can only continue to beget skills
when they are valued for their deeply personal significance
by their owner" (McPherson et al., 2012, p. 226).
The current study furthers the Simpkins et al. (2010)
study by demonstrating that elective sport at school is
preferred to elective music in school by adolescent males.
This mirrors the Simpkins et al. finding that out-of-school
sport is preferred to out-of-school music for adolescent
males. However, the present study does not just elucidate
why males choose sport and do not choose music but also
suggests that there are specific differences that influence
elective enrollment between sport and music subject
selection.
Nearly all RFC items for facilitating elective music and
sport were statistically identical across the two domains. The
most important (as measured by mean score) elective facili-
tator for both music and sport was interest in the subject (see
Table 4). Other important facilitator items for music and
sport included important subject, continue after school, good
at subject, and like teacher. These significant facilitator items
represent a cross-section of each of Expectancy-Value,
Ecological, and Self-Determination theories. The items
interest and important subject are related to the Ecological
and Expectancy-Value theories, while the item such as
teacher is related to the Ecological and Self-Determination
theories. In addition, the item good at subject is represented
in all three theories, and finally, the item continue after
school is related to only the Expectancy-Value theory.
Our results suggest that elective facilitators for music and
sport are predominantly individual-oriented, with interest in
the subject being the most influential. Follow-up ANOVA
was used to investigate which RFC items rated sport higher
than music. However, one notable exception from these sim-
ilarities across the domains was that students reported enjoy-
ing the theory of sport significantly more than enjoying the
theory of music. Although it was not a high scoring item, it
was significantly higher than for the music case, and there-
fore it distinguishes sport choice from music. We have not
yet cited a previous study that reports one reason that com-
pels students to select one subject over the other. The enjoy-
ment of theory of sport appears to be driven by cultural
factors, rather than because there is anything especially more
interesting about sport theory than music theory.
In contrast, factors impeding enrollment (barriers) were
significantly higher in music than in sport. The greatest
(highest mean) impediment reported to elective sport was
that it was considered an unimportant subject (7.25 [2.939]).
All other RFC items were rated at or below the scale mid-
point (6). Music impediments, however, were above the
scale midpoint (6) for every item (including not interested,
unimportant subject, not continuing after school, not good at
subject, don't enjoy theory, not interested in history, friends
not involved), apart from parent influence and not liking the
teacher.
The only impediment items that do not distinguish music
from sport were the high scoring lacking importance of the
subject and the low scoring parent influence. Perhaps any-
thing that is considered an unimportant subject is an impedi-
ment regardless of subject, whereas the other items that are
significantly stronger for music such as not interested, not
Waters et al. 11
continuing after school, not good at subject, don't like
teacher, friends not doing, don't enjoy theory, and not inter-
ested in history do appear to be subject-specific barriers.
Some reasons are obviously subject specific, such as dislik-
ing the teacher (Turton & Durrant, 2002), because the teacher
will be different for different subjects of study. A version to
music is most likely to have cultural origins--where boys at
the particular school, the parental socioeconomic status, and
broader exposure to sport rather than music, produce a halo
effect (Nisbett & Wilson, 1977), making many justifications
for non-subject selection accentuated. However, participants
reported that parent influence was not significant as a facili-
tator nor impediment across both music and sport domains.
Although the present study focused on RFC, the more
unusual finding of the study (e.g., that parental influence
may not be as important for this age group as previously sug-
gested) is notable in terms of the design of the study and the
ecological model proposed by Sulz et al. (2010).
Conclusion
This study explored reasons influencing adolescent choice of
elective subjects and extends previous research. Our
approach was to identify a selection of motivational "reasons
for choice" that sampled a range of theoretical factors in
motivation research. Furthermore, our comparison of two
subject domains, as well as the analysis of facilitators in tan-
dem with impediments, paves the way for more comprehen-
sive follow-up research. In the present study, we were able to
not only report that male students are more motivated to par-
ticipate in sport than in music in the socioeconomic and cul-
tural climate represented by the area in which the study was
conducted but also pinpoint the reasons for differences in
facilitators and impediments that promote elective choice
and reasons against choice of music or sport. Our results
indicate that individual-oriented items rather than social
environmental items may be more important in determining
a boy's choice of these elective subjects. Elective facilitators
were similar across music and sport domains, whereas
impediments were different across domains. Furthermore,
reasons for impediments to elective music were rated signifi-
cantly higher than reasons for impediments to elective sport.
While social environmental influences are important,
researchers and educators need to be particularly cognizant
of the dominant role individual-oriented factors play in ado-
lescent motivation and choice. In addition, impediments to
elective choices vary across music and sport domains for
adolescent males with significantly more impediments for
music.
These findings not only have implications for motivation
theory but also raise practical issues for teachers. It is vital
that educators become more cognizant of the different views
students have toward studying the theory of sport, which
overall students enjoyed, versus the theory of music, which,
on the whole, they did not. This reflects deeply embedded
values held toward music study, especially when compared
with sport study, and affirms McPherson and O'Neill's
(2010) finding that music study is least valued by students. If
music educators are to more fully engage and motivate stu-
dents, then the deeply embedded beliefs about the utility and
value of learning music must be addressed. Both students
and parents need to recognize that the highly valued out-
comes of self-discipline, co-operation, problem solving, and
creativity can all be developed through music study.
However, while McPherson et al. (2012) may correctly
believe that students who succeed are those who can imagine
themselves as musicians in the future, the onus rests on edu-
cators to engage the majority of students for whom music
will not result in a music career. Therefore, music educators
need to encourage students and parents to become more
reflective about the usefulness and importance of studying
music if they are to more fully engage their students. In addi-
tion, students must be presented with a future perspective
beyond school life to give purpose and meaning to their
music education. In other words, it is quite likely that at the
core of impediments and facilitators of music or sport choice
are cultural reasons. A more comprehensive understanding
of these motivational forces would enable researchers and
educators to implement effective strategies for promoting
elective enrollments and ultimately address some of the
impediments to more active participation in music as a
school subject.
