Context.--Physicalinactivitycontributestoweightgaininadults,butwhetherthis
relationship is true for children of different ethnic groups is not well established.
Objective.--To assess participation in vigorous activity and television watching
habits and their relationship to body weight and fatness in US children.
Design.--Nationally representative cross-sectional survey with an in-person in-
terview and medical examination.
Setting and Participants.--Between 1988 and 1994, 4063 children aged 8
through 16 years were examined as part of the National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey III. Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic blacks were over-
sampled to produce reliable estimates for these groups.
Main Outcome Measures.--Episodes of weekly vigorous activity and daily
hours of television watched, and their relationship to body mass index and body
fatness.
Results.--Eighty percent of US children reported performing 3 or more bouts of
vigorous activity each week. This rate was lower in non-Hispanic black and Mexi-
can American girls (69% and 73%, respectively). Twenty percent of US children
participatedin2orfewerboutsofvigorousactivityperweek,andtheratewashigher
in girls (26%) than in boys (17%). Overall, 26% of US children watched 4 or more
hours of television per day and 67% watched at least 2 hours per day. Non-Hispanic
black children had the highest rates of watching 4 or more hours of television per
day (42%). Boys and girls who watch 4 or more hours of television each day had
greater body fat (P.001) and had a greater body mass index (P.001) than those
who watched less than 2 hours per day.
Conclusions.--Many US children watch a great deal of television and are inad-
equately vigorously active. Vigorous activity levels are lowest among girls, non-
Hispanicblacks,andMexicanAmericans.Interventionstrategiestopromotelifelong
physical activity among US children are needed to stem the adverse health con-
sequences of inactivity.

THE PREVALENCE of overweight
continues to increase in the US adult
population.1-3 In the 12 years between the
Second National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES II, 1976
through 1980) and NHANES III (1988
through 1991), the prevalence of over-
weight in US adults increased from 25%
to 33%.2 The prevalence of overweight
also increased by similar magnitudes
among all sex and age groups of children
and adolescents.1 Obesity in children has
beenassociatedwithsubsequentmorbid-
ity and mortality in adulthood.4 These
trendshavepersisteddespiteournation's
intense preoccupation with weight.5
For editorial comment see p 959.
Similarly, the prevalence of obesity in
England has doubled in the past decade,
yet daily energy intake and fat consump-
tion have actually been reduced in that
country during this time period.6 A
change in the volume of daily physical ac-
tivity may account for this apparent dis-
crepancy. Increasingly, leisure time ac-
tivities are more sedentary, with televi-
sionwatching,videogames,andpersonal
computing among the most popular pas-
times. Further, people in industrialized
countries are expending less energy in
activities of daily living, and at work.6,7
Several studies suggest that an active
lifestyle during childhood and adoles-
cence can play an important role in op-
timizinggrowthanddevelopment.7,8 The
CentersforDiseaseControlandPreven-
tion recently recommended that com-
prehensive school and community pro-
grams be developed to promote physical
activity among children and adoles-
cents.9 The goals of these programs are
toincreaseknowledgeaboutactivityand
exercise, develop behavioral and motor
skills that promote lifelong activity, and
encourage physical activity outside of
physical education classes.

METHODS
Sample Design
The NHANES III was conducted by
the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, National Center for Health
Statistics. The plan and operation of
NHANES III have been described else-
where.10,11 Briefly, the survey was de-
signed to produce a nationally represen-
tative sample of the US population. One
of its main goals was to estimate the na-
tional prevalence of selected health con-
ditions and risk factors.
TheNHANESIIIrepresentsa6-year
study from 1988 through 1994 and con-
sists of two 3-year phases: phase I, 1988
through1991;andphaseII,1991through
1994. Although the entire 6-year survey
constitutes a national survey, the sur-
veywasdesignedsothateachphasewas
also a nationally representative sample.
The NHANES III oversampled Mexi-
canAmericans,non-Hispanicblacks,and
young children to ensure weighted, re-
liable estimates for these groups. Ap-
proximately 16 % of those interviewed
ranged in age from 8 through 16 years.
Combined data from phases I and II are
reported in this article.
The interview was conducted in the
child's home and a detailed clinical exami-
nation was performed in a mobile exami-
nation center. During the home interview
part of NHANES III, 5365 children were
interviewed and the analytic sample con-
sisted of 4063 children aged 8 through 16
yearswhocompletedthephysicalactivity
questionnaireandthebodymeasurement
componentatthemobileexaminationcen-
ter.Childrenwhowerementallyretarded
or had a proxy answer questions for them
were excluded from the analyses, as were
those with cerebral palsy, muscle weak-
ness, or paralysis of the arms or legs.
Interviewing staff consisted of experi-
enced persons, many of whom were of
HispanicoriginorbilingualinEnglishand
Spanish. Interview forms were available
in both languages. All staff attended
yearly training sessions to ensure main-
tenance of effective interviewing skills.
Information on self-reported race and
ethnicity was used to classify persons as
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
or Mexican American (persons of Mexi-
can origin living in the United States).
Age was defined as age in years at the
time of the household interview, which
precededtheexaminationby2to3weeks.
Dependent Variables
Participating children were asked how
many times per week they "played or ex-
ercised enough to make them sweat or
breathehard."Theseactivitiesdidnotex-
cludeschool-relatedinvolvementssuchas
physical education. The interview also in-
cluded a question on the number of hours
oftelevisionwatchedthedaybeforethein-
terview was administered. Body compo-
sitionwasestimatedbycalculatingtheBMI
[the weight (in kilograms) divided by the
height (in meters, squared)], since it has
beenfoundtobesignificantlyrelatedtothe
percentage of body fat and total body fat
in boys and girls.12 We also calculated the
sumofthesubscapularandsuprailiacskin-
folds as an index of trunk fat.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out
using SAS13 and WesVarPC.14 For each
survey,samplingweightswerecalculated
that took into account the unequal selec-
tion probabilities resulting from the clus-
ter design and from planned oversam-
pling of certain subgroups. All analyses
incorporated the sampling weights. For
varianceestimation,thebalancerepeated
replication method in the software pack-
ageWesVarPC14 wasused.Statisticaldif-
ferencesweredeterminedusing2-tailedt
teststakingthesamplingweightsandthe
complex sample design into account.14
Furthermore, the General Linear Model
procedure in SAS13 was used to calculate
the least square means to adjust for Tan-
ner stages15 in estimating physical activ-
ity and hours of television watching.
RESULTS
The cross-sectional prevalence esti-
mates of the number of bouts of vigorous
activity per week for US children aged 8
through 16 years from 1988 through 1994
are shown in Table 1. Overall, 80% re-
portedparticipatinginplayorexercisethat
made them sweat or breathe hard 3 or
moretimesperweek;theratewashigher
in boys (85%) than in girls (74%). Among
non-Hispanicwhiteboys,88%reportedex-

boys and 80% of Mexican American boys
metthiscriterion;72.6%ofMexicanAmeri-
can girls and 69% of non-Hispanic black
girlsreportedperforming3ormorebouts
of vigorous activity each week, whereas
only12.2%ofnon-Hispanicwhiteboysre-
ported fewer than 3 bouts of vigorous ac-
tivity per week. Table 1 also presents
prevalenceratesofboutsofvigorousphysi-
cal activity among various age groups of
USchildren.Boysandgirlsreportedsimi-
lar patterns of vigorous play in both the 8
through 10 years and the 11 through 13
years age groups with the boys reporting
slightly more physical activity in each
group.However,only65%ofgirlsaged14
through16yearsreported3ormorebouts
ofvigorousactivityperweek,whereas86%
of age-matched boys achieved this level.
Few boys or girls reported 1 or less bouts
ofvigorousactivityperweek,withtheex-
ception of 20.1% of 14- to 16-year-old girls
reporting this level of inactivity. Further
analyses (data not shown) revealed that
8.7% of the 14- to16-year-old girls re-
ported less than 1 bout of vigorous activ-
ity per week.
The cross-sectional prevalence rate
estimates of hours of television watched
per day among US children are present-
ed in Table 2. Overall, 26% of American
children reported watching 4 or more
hours of television per day; the rate was
lower in girls (23%) than in boys (29%).
Forty-three percent of non-Hispanic
black boys and girls reported watching
television for more than 4 hours per day.

watching television more than 4 hours
per day (25% of boys and 18% of girls).
Boys and girls reported similar pat-
terns of television watching across age
groups (Table 2). The highest prevalence
of watching 4 or more hours of television
perdayoccurredin11-to13-year-oldchil-
dren.Bothboysandgirlsinthisagegroup
also had the lowest prevalence of watch-
ing 1 or less hours of television per day.

tivity per week had the lowest. In the
girls, no clear trend occurred.
Figure 2 shows the Tanner-score ad-

highest BMIs; conversely, children who
watched less than 1 hour of television
per day had the lowest BMIs.

We observed that television watching

variate analyses revealed no interaction
between television watching and physi-
calactivity.Furthermore,significantef-
fects were seen for television watching
but not for physical activity.
COMMENT
We found that US children are cur-
rently more active than their adult coun-
terparts, with almost 80% reporting 3 or
more bouts of vigorous activity each
week.16 However, there are several wor-
risome trends among adolescent females
and ethnic minority groups. Of concern,
26% of all girls and 31% of non-Hispanic
black girls report 2 or fewer bouts of vig-
orous activity per week. Our data recon-
firm that vigorous activity among ethnic
minority children is lower than in non-
Hispanicwhitechildren.17,18 Suchinforma-
tionmustbeconsideredwhendeveloping
physical education curricula and commu-
nity-based intervention strategies aimed
at increasing physical activity among dif-
ferent target populations.
OneoftheobjectivesofHealthyPeople
2000 is to increase vigorous physical ac-
tivity to at least 3 days per week for 20
minutes or more per occasion in at least
75%ofchildrenandadolescents.19 Boysof
all ages appear to be meeting this crite-
rion. However, a decrease in physical ac-
tivity seems to occur as girls move from
the 11- to 13-year age group to the 14- to
16-year age group. Moreover, 20.1% of
girls aged 14 to 16 years reported 1 or
fewer bouts of vigorous physical activity
each week. These data are consistent
with the 1992 National Health Interview
Survey - Youth Risk Behavior Survey,
which reported that 8.7 % of 15- year-old
femalesreportednoparticipationinmod-
erate or vigorous activity,16 and that
18.5%of17-year-oldfemaleswereseden-
tary.Malina20 hassuggestedthattheado-
lescent decline in physical activity that
occursafterthegrowthspurtisprobably
related to the social demands of adoles-
cence, changing interests and the transi-
tion from school to work or school to col-
lege. However, the level of physical ac-
tivity in our study may be optimistically
high because children who lived in north-
ernstatesweresurveyedduringthesum-
merwhenphysicalactivityisknowntobe
at its peak. Furthermore, the question
about physical activity did not assess
moderateactivityordurationofvigorous
activity, so a brief bout of vigorous activ-
ity could have been reported as a single
bout of exercise.
Because a sedentary lifestyle is con-
sidered a risk factor for coronary artery
disease,21 parents and health care pro-
fessionals need to encourage adolescent
females in particular to maintain active
lifestyles throughout adolescence. The
International Consensus Conference on
Physical Activity Guidelines for Adoles-
cents recommends that "all adoles-
cents . . . be physically active daily, or
nearly every day, as part of play, games,
sports,work,transportation,recreation,
physical education, or planned exercise,
in the context of family, school, and com-
munity activities" and that "adolescents
engage in three or more sessions per
week of activities that last 20 minutes or

ate to vigorous levels of exertion."22
We also found that non-Hispanic white
childrenwerethemostactive,with77%of
girls and 88% of boys reporting 3 or more
boutsofvigorousactivityperweek.How-
ever, only 69% of non-Hispanic black girls
and73%ofMexicanAmericangirlsreached
thisthreshold.Concernsaboutcrimemay
present a major barrier to some children
becomingmorephysicallyactive.7 Inasur-
vey of parents, 46% of US adults believed
that their neighborhoods were unsafe.23
Parents in minority populations are twice
as likely as non-Hispanic white parents to
report that their neighborhoods were un-
safe. This information may partially ex-
plain the lower bouts of vigorous activity
andhigherprevalenceoftelevisionwatch-
ing reported in non-Hispanic black and
Mexican American children. Successful
implementation of policies to address this
problem may help to increase physical ac-
tivity in these 2 groups. For example,
neighborhood watch programs and in-
creased policing in high crime areas may
help alleviate fears and foster an environ-
ment where parents feel it is safefor their
children to play. Furthermore, Healthy
People 2000 calls for increased commu-
nityavailabilityandaccessibilityofphysi-
cal activity and fitness facilities.19 Thus,
studies that specifically attempt to pro-
mote enjoyable, lifetime activities among
ethnic minorities should receive high pri-
ority in the public health arena.
Troiano and colleagues1 reported that
the prevalence of overweight is increas-
ing among boys and girls of all age groups
and suggested increasing physical activ-
ity as a means to address this important
health problem. Physical activity is in-
verselyrelatedtobodyweight,bodycom-
position, and the waist-to-hip ratio in
adults. Sedentary leisure time activities
suchastelevisionwatching,playingvideo
games,andpersonalcomputinghavecon-
tributed to the increasing prevalence of
overweight in America.24-27 Our report
shows that television watching was asso-
ciated with increased skinfold thickness
and BMI among US youth.
Overall, we found high rates of televi-
sion watching, with 26% of US children
(and43%ofnon-Hispanicblackchildren)
watching 4 or more hours per day.
Strasburger28 hascalculatedthattheav-
erage high school graduate will likely
spend 15 000 to 18 000 hours in front of a
televisionbutonly12 000hoursinschool.
Nexttosleeping,televisionwatchingoc-
cupies the greatest amount of leisure
time during childhood.27 We found that
skinfold thicknesses increased in both
boys and girls as the amount of televi-
sion watched increased. This finding is
consistent with an earlier study that
found a significant relationship between
television watching and the prevalence
of obesity in children.26
We also found a relationship between
television watching, physical activity,
and body composition. Children who
watched more television and were less
likely to participate in vigorous activity
tended to have higher BMIs. This is con-
sistent with the findings of Durant et
al.29 Two studies have reported strong
inverserelationshipsbetweentelevision

has been used to effectively tailor cul-
turally appropriate physical activity
promotion programs.

therisksofobesityinadulthoodappearto
be greater in persons who were over-
weight during childhood and adolescent
years.35,36 Thus,increasedeffortsmustbe
placed on preventing excessive weight
gain in older children.
Inourstudy,BMIandthesumoftrunk
skinfolds were similar in boys and girls
who were highly active compared with
those who participated in little activity.
Conversely, children who watched the
most television had more body fat and
greater BMIs than those who watched
less than 2 hours per day. This under-
scores the work of Epstein and col-
leagues,37 who reported that decreasing
sedentary behaviors is a key ingredient
to the successful treatment of childhood
obesity. Moreover, repeated exposure to
television commercials for food may
prompt children to increase food con-
sumption, which ultimately leads to
weight gain.38 Sedentary activities that
are regularly associated with eating also
can become conditioned cues for eating,
such that a child who is not hungry and
begins television watching may find that
the television watching cues eating.39
For young people, learning to be
physically active may be a more potent
motivator for physical activity than the
knowledge about why being physically
active is important.40,41 Health care pro-
fessionals,parents,andeducatorsshould
encourage children and adolescents to
be active before, during, and after the
school day. Recent guidelines for the
promotion of lifelong physical activity
recommend that health care profession-
als routinely assess levels of physical ac-
tivityintheiryoungpatients.Physicians
can play a key role in encouraging sed-
entary children and their families to
adopt more active lifestyles.42,43 Inactive
children and adolescents should be
guidedtowardschoolorcommunitypro-
grams that encourage physical activity.
Children and adolescents who regularly
participateinphysicalactivityshouldbe
encouraged to continue and maintain
their active ways.
In summary, although many American
children (80%) are regularly active, rates
of inactivity among adolescent girls, non-
Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans
are cause for concern. One quarter of all
USchildrenwatch4ormorehoursoftele-
visioneachday,asdo43%ofnon-Hispanic
blacks.Hoursoftelevisionwatchingisre-
lated to both BMI and skinfold thickness.
Physicians and other health care profes-
sionals should counsel children and their
caregivers on the importance of regular
physical activity and decreasing seden-
tary activities. Intervention strategies
designed to promote lifetime physical ac-
tivity represent a major public health
challenge and priority.
