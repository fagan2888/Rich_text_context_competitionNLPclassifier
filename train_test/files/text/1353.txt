The protective relation of ascorbic acid and -tocopherol to the development of diabetic retinopathy has not
been thoroughly evaluated in epidemiologic studies. The association of prevalent diabetic retinopathy with serum
ascorbic acid and -tocopherol was studied among participants with type 2 diabetes (40 years) (n = 998) in the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­1994); 20% of the sample (n = 199) had prevalent
retinopathy. The overall odds ratio for retinopathy among participants in quartile 4 compared with quartile 1 for
serum ascorbic acid was 1.3 (95% confidence interval: 0.8, 2.3), with a p for trend = 0.60 after adjustment for the
confounders of smoking, race, waist/hip ratio, hypertension, and duration of diabetes. The overall odds ratio for
retinopathy among participants in quartile 4 compared with quartile 1 for serum -tocopherol was 2.7 (95%
confidence interval: 1.6, 4.6), with a p for trend = 0.14 after adjustment for confounders. After removal of
supplement users of vitamin C (n = 307) or vitamin E (n = 298), the odds ratio changed direction or was
attenuated: adjusted odds ratios for retinopathy among participants in quartile 4 compared with quartile 1 for
serum ascorbic acid and -tocopherol = 0.7 (95% confidence interval: 0.3, 1.4) and 1.6 (95% confidence interval:
0.9, 2.9), respectively. In summary, no significant associations were observed between serum levels of major
dietary antioxidants and retinopathy. Recent use of supplements for treatment of complications of diabetes may
explain the direct associations.

Persons with diabetes suffer from micro- and macrovas-
cular disease such as diabetic retinopathy, a disease of the
retinal microvasculature. Retinopathy occurs in just over 2.5
percent of the population aged 18 years or more (1).
Ascorbic acid and -tocopherol are nutrients hypothesized
to prevent retinopathy by affecting presumed pathogenic
factors: protein glycosylation, insulin sensitivity, retinal
blood flow, and oxidative stress (2­24). Not all studies,
however, support these hypotheses (25­30). The majority of
research investigating the potential protective effect of
ascorbic acid and -tocopherol has been conducted in
diabetic animal models and short-term supplementation
trials. Only one population-based study has investigated the
relation between the risk of severity of diabetic retinopathy
and these antioxidant nutrients, using dietary intake from
one 24-hour recall (31). This previous study showed an
increased risk of diabetic retinopathy with increasing intake
of vitamins C and E (31). Additional research is needed to
assess the association between these micronutrients and
retinopathy in the general population of persons with
diabetes.
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) provides the opportunity to investi-
gate the association between biomarkers of ascorbic acid and
-tocopherol intakes and the odds of prevalent diabetic
retinopathy in a large sample of free-living persons (32). The
purpose of this research was to investigate the association
between serum ascorbic acid and -tocopherol concentra-
tions and prevalent retinopathy using data from NHANES
III. We hypothesized that participants in the highest,

compared with the lowest, quartile of serum ascorbic acid
and -tocopherol would have less retinopathy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
NHANES III was conducted by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention between 1988 and 1994 using a
nationally representative probability sample of the US
noninstitutionalized civilian population. A multistage proba-
bility sample design was used with oversampling of certain
subgroups to allow more precise estimates, including non-
Hispanic Blacks, Mexican Americans, and adults over 60
years of age. All eligible participants were invited to
complete a household interview to obtain information on
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, health
history, and dietary behavior. All interviewed persons were
invited to participate in a medical examination that was
conducted at a mobile examination center. The examination
included body measurements, fundus photography, urine
collection, a 24-hour dietary recall interview, and phle-
botomy to measure a number of hematologic factors.
Sample selection
Persons with type 2 diabetes were identified from a total of
14,464 persons 40 years of age or more who were invited to
participate in NHANES III. Of the 14,464 persons aged 40 or
more years who were eligible for the survey, 11,448 persons
were interviewed and 9,737 were examined in the mobile
examination center. These analyses were restricted to non-
Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Mexican Amer-
icans. Persons of other races or ethnicities were excluded (n =
371), because the sample sizes were too small to allow statis-
tically reliable estimates.
A total of 1,434 persons were classified as having type 2
diabetes. Participants who reported being diagnosed with
diabetes by their physician and who recalled being diag-
nosed at age 30 or more years were considered to have type
2 diabetes (n = 1,137). If a participant fasted for 10 or more
hours, completed an oral glucose tolerance test, and had a
plasma glucose level equal to or greater than 200 mg/dl, he/
she was also considered to have type 2 diabetes (n = 297)
(33).
Persons with missing or ungradable fundus photographs
for retinopathy were excluded (n = 256). Persons were also
excluded if they had missing serum ascorbic acid or -toco-
pherol values (n = 75), missing food frequency data (n = 1),
or missing data for potential confounders or other significant
covariates (n = 104). Thus, a total of 998 participants with
type 2 diabetes were eligible for inclusion in these analyses,
and 20 percent (n = 199) had retinopathy. Overall, the
sample used in these analyses was 70 percent of all non-
Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, or Mexican-American
persons 40 years of age or more classified with type 2
diabetes in NHANES III (n = 1,434).
To understand the differences between the sample we
selected for our study (n = 998) and those persons who were
excluded (n = 436) from the original sample of non-Hispanic
White, non-Hispanic Black, and Mexican-American persons
with type 2 diabetes for missing data, we compared the
demographic, physical, lifestyle, dietary, and medical char-
acteristics of these two samples. The persons with type 2
diabetes who were excluded from this study were older (65
vs. 62 years, p < 0.0001), more likely to be Mexican Amer-
ican and non-Hispanic Black than non-Hispanic White
(Mexican American: 6.3 percent vs. 5.2 percent; non-
Hispanic Black: 14 percent vs. 13 percent, p = 0.008), had a
longer duration of diabetes (8.2 vs. 6.9 years, p = 0.003),
were less likely to be anemic (hemoglobin of <15 g/dl: 93
percent vs. 89 percent, p = 0.009), and were more likely to
have had higher plasma cholesterol concentrations (6.0 vs.
5.9 mg/dl, p = 0.009). These two groups did not differ with
respect to sex, glycosylated hemoglobin, body mass index,
dietary intake, hypertension, smoking, prevalent retinop-
athy, cardiovascular disease, or supplement use.
Serum data
Serum samples were analyzed for -tocopherol and
ascorbic acid levels using reversed phase high-performance
liquid chromatography with multiwavelength detection at
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey labo-
ratory located at the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion. Detailed descriptions of laboratory analyses are
described elsewhere (34).
Serum -tocopherol values were log transformed because
of the skewness of the data. Because -tocopherol levels are
directly associated with serum cholesterol levels (35)
(Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.33), log-transformed
serum -tocopherol values were regressed on serum choles-
terol to compute residuals. The residuals were used in anal-
yses to remove the effect of interindividual lipid level
variation on serum -tocopherol measurements.
Dietary and supplement data
The dietary and supplement data collected included a 24-
hour recall, query for supplement use including questions
regarding dose and duration, and a 60-item food frequency
questionnaire (36). The food frequency questionnaire was
designed to estimate dietary intake over a 1-month period of
time prior to the interview (36). The nutrient composition
databases used to create the nutrient estimates were devel-
oped using foods reported in the NHANES III 24-hour
recalls as described previously (37).
The food frequency questionnaire was not quantitative or
comprehensive for energy-yielding foods. Additionally, the
food frequency questionnaire data could not be used to
adequately represent the intake of dietary vitamin E, of
which -tocopherol is one isomer, because the food
frequency questionnaire queried for intakes of fats and oils
but did not differentiate between animal and vegetable fats.
Only vegetable fats are rich sources of vitamin E. Addition-
ally, the use of added fats and oils in cooking, a large source
of vitamin E in the diet, was not assessed in the NHANES III
food frequency questionnaire. For these reasons, analyses of
the association between dietary sources of vitamins C and E
are not presented in this paper.

Fundus photography and grading
Retinopathy was assessed by nonmydriatic fundus photo-
graphs of one randomly chosen eye for all participants aged
40 years or more. Photographic fields were graded, in a
masked fashion, by trained graders at the Ocular Epidemi-
ology Grading Center, University of Wisconsin Medical
School. The presence and severity of retinopathy, as well as
the presence of specific diabetic lesions, were classified
using the Modified Airlie House Classification scheme and
the Early Treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy Study severity
scale (38). Participants were classified as having no retinop-
athy, mild nonproliferative retinopathy, moderate nonprolif-
erative retinopathy, or proliferative retinopathy. The
outcome variable was binary: any retinopathy (mild,
moderate, or proliferative) versus no retinopathy.
Statistical analyses
Odds ratios and 95 percent confidence intervals for retin-
opathy were calculated using logistic regression for each
quartile of serum ascorbic acid and -tocopherol, with those
in the lowest quartile as the reference category. The Wald
test for trend was performed on continuous serum ascorbic
acid or -tocopherol concentrations.
The variables tested as potential confounders were race,
duration of diabetes, treatment group (a categorical variable
defined as dietary treatment only, oral hypoglycemic agent
use, or insulin use), insulin use, oral hypoglycemic agent
use, body mass index, waist/hip ratio, hypertension, smoking
status, and hemoglobin concentrations, as a marker for
anemia, as shown in table 1. If treatment type was deter-
mined to be a confounder, then neither insulin use nor oral
hypoglycemic agent use was added to the final model to
avoid the effects of multicollinearity. Potential confounders
were entered singly into the logistic regression model. If the
factor changed the beta coefficient 10 percent or more, it was
determined to be a confounder. If an inverse association was
found between either ascorbic acid or -tocopherol, then
glycosylated hemoglobin, a monitor of longitudinal blood
glucose control, was added to the final model to investigate
to what degree glycosylated hemoglobin might explain the
protective effect of these nutrients on retinopathy.
The relations of these serum nutrients to retinopathy were
evaluated for interactions. The consistency of relations of
serum ascorbic acid and -tocopherol to retinopathy was
evaluated after stratification of the overall analyses by poten-
tial effect modifiers (i.e., race, blood glucose control, dura-
tion of diabetes, and the treatment type used to control blood
glucose levels). Analyses were stratified by the median
cutpoint for duration of diabetes (10 years) in this popula-
tion. The sample was also stratified by glycosylated hemo-
globin levels above and below the American Diabetes
Association recommended cutoffs for poor and good
glycemic control using glycosylated hemoglobin (39). The
likelihood ratio test, comparing the logistic regression
models with and without interaction terms, was used with an
alpha level of 0.10 or less to determine significance.
Further exploratory analyses were conducted after
removal of supplement users. We categorized supplement
users of vitamin C or vitamin E to be participants who
consumed the nutrient in supplement form at the level of at
least one recommended daily allowance per week. Other-
wise participants were considered nonusers. Serum nutrient
levels may reflect recent use of supplements and not long-
term supplement use or dietary status. Recent use of supple-
ments might also have occurred as a result of diabetes
severity or complications.
Total interview or examination sample final weights were
applied to all estimates to account for differential probability
of selection and for nonresponse (40). For each regression
analysis, the jackknife replication method was used to obtain
appropriate variance estimates (41).
All analyses were conducted using SAS version 8.2 soft-
ware (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
Serum ascorbic acid and diabetic retinopathy
Distributions of risk factors by level of serum ascorbic
acid. Differences in potential risk factors of retinopathy
between high and low quartile ranges of serum ascorbic acid
concentrations are shown in table 1. Participants at the
highest level of serum ascorbic acid were older and more
likely to be female, non-Hispanic White, users of hypogly-
cemic agents, leaner, persons with smaller waist/hip ratios,
and less hypertensive. Participants at the highest level of
serum ascorbic acid were also more likely to be past smokers
and supplement users than those individuals in quartile 1.
Persons in quartile 4 of serum ascorbic acid also had higher
serum -tocopherol concentrations, higher intake of dietary
vitamin C, carbohydrates, and dietary fiber, but lower
dietary intake of total, saturated, and monounsaturated fat
compared with persons in quartile 1 of serum ascorbic acid.
Relations of serum ascorbic acid to retinopathy. The odds
of retinopathy did not differ between persons in the high
versus the low serum ascorbic acid quartile (odds ratio = 1.4,
95 percent confidence interval: 0.8, 2.3). Adjustment for
confounders did not alter this association (table 2). After
supplement users of vitamin C were removed from the
overall analyses (n = 301), serum ascorbic acid was no
longer directly associated with retinopathy (table 2).
Analyses were conducted in separate strata for potential
effect modifiers. Associations were not consistent across race
or treatment groups. There was a borderline significant inter-
action by race (p for interaction = 0.09) and treatment group
(p for interaction = 0.02). For non-Hispanic Blacks and
Mexican Americans, the risk of retinopathy was lower in
quartile 4 compared with quartile 1, but the association was
statistically significant only among Mexican Americans (table
2). Additionally, the association between serum ascorbic acid
and retinopathy was inverse, albeit not statistically significant,
among persons who used oral hypoglycemics or insulin for
glycemic control (table 2).

Am J Epidemiol 2003;158:225­233
Serum -tocopherol and diabetic retinopathy
Distributions of risk factors by level of serum -tocoph-
erol. Participants in quartile 4 for serum -tocopherol were
more likely be non-Hispanic White, past smokers, and
supplement users compared with participants in quartile 1
for serum -tocopherol (table 1). Participants in quartile 4
for serum -tocopherol were also more likely to have greater
serum ascorbic acid, triglyceride, and cholesterol concentra-
tions and greater intake of dietary fiber than participants in
quartile 1 for serum -tocopherol (table 1).
Relations of serum -tocopherol to retinopathy. The crude
overall odds ratio for retinopathy among persons in high
versus low serum -tocopherol quartile ranges was direct
(odds ratio = 2.2, 95 percent confidence interval: 1.4, 3.6).
Adjustment for confounders did not change the direction but
slightly increased the magnitude of this association (table 3).
After removal of supplement users of vitamin E (n = 298),
the adjusted relation was attenuated (table 3).
There was a statistically significant interaction of the rela-
tion of serum -tocopherol to retinopathy by treatment type
(p for interaction = 0.009) and also by level of glycosylated
hemoglobin (p for interaction = 0.003). The odds ratios were
slightly attenuated in persons using insulin or oral hypogly-
cemic agents to control their blood sugar (table 3). Stratifica-
tion by glycosylated hemoglobin resulted in attenuation of
the odds ratio in the direction of the null in persons with poor
glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin, 7 percent) and
strengthening of the association in persons with good
glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin, <7 percent)
(table 3).
Supplements of vitamins C and E and diabetic
retinopathy
The relation between the odds of prevalent retinopathy and
duration of supplement use containing vitamin C or E was
investigated (table 4). There was no relation between reti-
nopathy and supplement use of either nutrient for a period
from 1 to less than 5 years. The relation between supplement
use of vitamins C and E for at least 5 years was directly
related to the risk of diabetic retinopathy, but it was not
statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
Although we hypothesized that those participants in the
highest, compared with the lowest, quartile of serum
ascorbic acid would have less prevalent retinopathy, we
found no such overall association. We may have failed to
find a protective effect of ascorbic acid on retinopathy
because people at a higher risk for retinopathy may have
begun to use supplements subsequent to the development of
retinopathy. This could have masked a potential inverse
association. In support of this, the overall association was

reversed after supplement users of vitamin C were excluded
from analyses, and use of supplements containing vitamin C
for longer than 5 years was directly related to retinopathy
(albeit not significantly).
Serum measurements reflect recent dietary intake (within
the last few weeks) and not a person's exposure over the
course of a year or many years. This may contribute to
random measurement error of ascorbic acid exposure,
reducing the ability to observe a statistically significant
protective relation of serum ascorbic acid. Perhaps, the
primary window of exposure for the development of retinop-
athy occurs earlier then what was detected by our study's
measurements. If a person had made dietary changes as a
result of diabetic complications prior to 1988, this would not
have been reflected in the single measurements of serum
ascorbic acid collected in NHANES III. Conclusions from

other studies of diet and age-related eye disease have shown
that assessment of past dietary intake, or intake prior to inci-
dent disease, may be more influential then recent dietary
intake on eye disease development (42, 43).
Data from supplementation trials, in vitro studies, and
animal models suggest that ascorbic acid may protect against
retinopathy (2­7, 14­17, 21, 22). Despite direct associations
with serum ascorbic acid and retinopathy, further analyses
indicated that this association did not persist within
subgroups of this sample. There was no association between
serum ascorbic acid and retinopathy among non-Hispanic
Whites, and the odds ratios for retinopathy were less than 1.0
among non-Hispanic Blacks and Mexican Americans. When
the NHANES III sample weights were applied to the anal-
yses, the non-Hispanic White subgroup, which was not over-
sampled in NHANES III, was given a greater amount of
weight in the overall weighted analyses. This may have
resulted in the overall direct association, although not statis-
tically significant relation, observed between serum ascorbic
acid and diabetic retinopathy.
Contrary to our hypothesis, we observed a direct overall
association between serum -tocopherol and retinopathy.
Similar to the results of the serum ascorbic acid analyses, the
direct association found between serum -tocopherol and
retinopathy was attenuated after exclusion of supplement
users of vitamin E. The recent use of vitamin E supplements
for treatment of complications of diabetes may have resulted
in the positive association reported. At the same time, long-
term supplement use of vitamin E was directly, although not
significantly, associated with retinopathy. Thus, the direct
association with vitamin E may reflect the earlier presence of
diabetic complications or other characteristics of persons
using vitamin E supplements.
The statistically significant, direct relation between serum
-tocopherol and retinopathy was not consistent across treat-
ment groups. This interaction was probably driven by the
direct relation between serum -tocopherol and retinopathy
in the dietary treatment group, which had too few cases to
report a stable risk estimate. There was no statistically signif-
icant relation between serum -tocopherol and retinopathy
in persons who used insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.
Some studies have found diet to be protective against
retinopathy in only those persons with poor glycemic control
(44) (A. E. Millen, University of Wisconsin-Madison,
unpublished manuscript). For this reason, we stratified our
analyses by glycemic control. We did not observe an inverse
association in those persons with poor blood glycemic
control (glycosylated hemoglobin, 7 percent), but the direct
relation between -tocopherol and retinopathy was attenu-
ated in this subgroup. We observed a direct association in
those persons with good blood glycemic control (glycosy-
lated hemoglobin, <7 percent), but the small number of cases
in this subgroup may have prevented us from determining a
stable estimate of the relation of -tocopherol to retinopathy.
To date, this is only the second epidemiologic study inves-
tigating the relations between diabetic retinopathy and anti-
oxidant nutrients. The San Luis Valley Diabetes Study
investigated the relation between antioxidant intake and the
risk of severity of retinopathy among participants with type
2 diabetes (31). Mayer-Davis et al. found a statistically
significant risk for increased severity of retinopathy with
increasing levels of ascorbic acid intake over time and an
increased risk of retinopathy with increasing intake of
vitamin E in participants not using insulin. The San Luis
Valley Study was unable to explain the observed direct asso-
ciations between antioxidant intake and retinopathy;
however, they used only a 24-hour recall, which is not reflec-
tive of long-term dietary intake. Clearly, both the present
study and the San Luis Valley Study are limited by their
cross-sectional design that can be problematic when
analyzing relations of conditions that develop over the long
term.
Our analyses may have been biased by the exclusion of
those persons with missing data who were identified to have
type 2 diabetes. These persons were older with a longer dura-
tion of diabetes and were therefore at a greater risk of reti-
nopathy. Their exclusion may have diminished our ability to
detect an association if one exists. Additionally, our sample
size would have been larger if persons from the afternoon or
evening sample of NHANES III had been more accurately
diagnosed with diabetes (45). Overall, this study was limited
by statistical power (e.g., power to detect an odds ratio of
0.60 in quartile 4 for retinopathy = 80 percent), with power
diminishing in stratified analyses.
In summary, we observed no relation between serum
ascorbic acid or -tocopherol and retinopathy in NHANES
III. The large body of evidence that indicates a potential for
protection in animal studies and short-term supplementation
trials is inconsistent with the sparse epidemiologic data to
date. Inconsistent results across population subgroups in this
study, as well as insufficient statistical power to evaluate
relations in subgroups, indicate the need to further evaluate
these associations in large prospective studies.
