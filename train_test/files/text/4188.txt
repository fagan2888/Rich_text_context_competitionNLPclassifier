I implemented an action research design to examine the collab-
orative process among people with disabilities (PWDs), munici-
pal officials, and residents engaged in welfare activities that
transpired during a series of residents' meetings (hereafter
referred to as "RMs") in Japan. In addition, I employed the
sense-making theory, which is based on the narratives of organi-
zation members, and Ross's (1955) three community organiza-
tional aspects--tasks, processes, and relationships--to develop
an in-depth understanding of group dynamics with respect to
members'experiences and organizational development.
In Japan, RMs are established by local governments as a
venue for residents without professional knowledge to
exchange opinions on welfare issues such as community
work, disabilities, child rearing, and the care of senior citi-
zens. Local governments often use RMs to collect residents'
opinions to launch municipal government action plans for
welfare policy. The explicit purpose of RM dialogue is to
incorporate important aspects of the discussion into policy;
however, only some of these important elements are success-
fully integrated in relevant policies. Local officials are
responsible for determining which matters discussed in the
RMs should be incorporated into policy. Beyond the explicit
purpose of RMs, there is also an implicit purpose--provid-
ing RM members an opportunity to share their experiences
with each other and develop a sense of solidarity by regularly
attending these meetings. Therefore, even though not all dis-
cussions result in policy development, these RMs allow resi-
dents opportunities to engage in meaningful interactions.
According to the Cabinet Office of the Government of
Japan (COGJ; 2014b), approximately 7.88 million Japanese
people (nearly 6% of the total population) had physical or
intellectual disabilities or mental disorders in 2012. This
study applies the "disability" terminology used by the
Japanese government. Over the past 20 years, the administra-
tive role of Japan's municipal governments in disability pol-
icy has been expanding (Ozawa & Ohshima, 2012). The
Japanese central government has attempted to decrease the
number of institutionalized PWDs and increase in-home sup-
port services, respite care, and day care facilities to promote
the active participation of PWDs in the community (Ozawa
& Ohshima, 2012).
Grassroots disability movements, such as the independent
living movement, philosophies of normalization, and desig-
nation of 1981 as the International Year of Disabled Persons
(United Nations, 1981), strongly influenced this policy. An
important negotiation between PWDs and local governments
began in the 1980s, when independent living became a goal
of the Japanese government as an alternative to institutional
living for people with physical disabilities. At the time,

Action Research on Drafting Municipal
Policies for People With Disabilities in
Japan
Masakuni Tagaki1
Abstract
This study describes a series of regularly scheduled residents' meetings (RMs) on local disability policy during a 15-year
period. The study employed an action research analytical method using data gathered in Yao city in western Japan. From 2002
to 2007, I participated in the meetings as an advisor--overseeing two focus groups, each with six key informants who actively
managed the meetings. According to the results, the meetings occurred in three phases: the officials' initiatives (2002-2003),
collaborations between city officials and leading residents (2004-2006), and the final fiscal year (2007). Initially, city officials
or I led the meetings; later, however, certain residents accepted leadership roles to manage the meetings. Subsequently, the
focus group interviewees successfully managed projects. Although these projects were not the ultimate goals of the RMs,
they enabled residents to redefine disability issues in the community.

human rights organizations began negotiating with munici-
pal governments to implement in-home care services because
PWDs were increasingly leaving institutions and rejoining
their communities.
In Japan, PWDs value employment as a means to partici-
pate in society and enjoy economic independence (Tagaki,
2016). A 2014 survey by the Ministry of Health, Labour and
Welfare (MHLW; 2014) estimated the number of employed
PWDs to be approximately 500,000. Employment for PWDs
is available in both public (i.e., central or municipal govern-
ments) and private sectors. In 1960, Japan enacted an
employment quota system for PWDs under the People With
Disabilities Employment Promotion Law (Japanese Law No.
123).1 In 2015, the employment quota was 2.0% for private
companies and 2.3% for statutory corporations, the central
government, and local governments. In 2013, the COGJ
(2014b) reported that the employment rate of PWDs in pri-
vate companies was approximately 1.76% of the total work-
force, which currently remains below the legal requirement
despite having steadily increased.
Over time, public interest in the needs of PWDs has
increased. In a recent public survey on people's attitudes
toward PWDs, approximately 70% of the respondents
reported that they have helped or talked to PWDs (COGJ,
2012). This is a significant increase from 1987, when only
46.6% of respondents reported interacting with PWDs (Prime
Minister's Office, 1987). Nevertheless, 89% of the respon-
dents to the 2012 survey stated that prejudice or discrimina-
tion exists against PWDs, which is slightly higher than that
reported by a 2007 survey (83%) (COGJ, 2007, 2012)
An Action Plan for a Municipality-Level
Disability Policy
The RMs investigated in this study were initially concerned
with an action plan for a municipal disability policy that the
local government was legally obligated to develop. The
Disabled Persons'Fundamental Law (Japanese Law No. 84),
amended in 2007, states that every municipal government in
Japan must devise an action plan for disability policy. The
Services and Support for Persons With Disabilities Act of
2006 states that every municipal government must provide
an action plan to develop systems that provide disability ser-
vices to PWDs. The former deals broadly with disability
policy in a variety of fields, such as medical care and educa-
tion, and it discusses a barrier-free urban development plan
and improvements in public attitudes toward PWDs. The lat-
ter focuses on the timing for providing disability services,
such as in-home support, day care, and respite care.
When the Democratic Party of Japan came to power in
2009, the Japanese government launched the Council for
National Disability Policy Reform (hereafter referred to as
"the Council"; COGJ, 2009). The Council's main agenda
was to reform the 2006 Services and Support for Persons
With Disabilities Act to formulate an antidiscrimination act.
The Council was comprised of people with diverse disabili-
ties, academic professionals, disability service representa-
tives, policy makers, and high-ranking officials. This Council
represented a significant shift in governance because of its
diverse membership, and it met more than 20 times in 3
years. The Council proposed amendments to the Disabled
Persons' Fundamental Law and Services and Support for
Persons With Disabilities Act, and proposed legislation for
the antidiscrimination act (COGJ, 2009). However, proof of
the Council's influence at municipal-level meetings was
lacking. In July 2012, after issuing the proposals, the Council
was disbanded, just months before the Liberal Democratic
Party once again came to power.
A municipal council (MC) for disability policy is an orga-
nization tasked with developing an action plan for disability
policy and service provision at the municipal level. In general,
MCs include academic professionals, welfare/health profes-
sionals, representatives of public organizations, high-ranking
municipal officials, and PWDs. In addition, opinions of local
PWDs are collected through surveys and short public hearings
held for local disability organizations. According to the COGJ
(2014c), 80.4% and 62.0% of municipal governments con-
ducted surveys and provided hearings, respectively.
However, regarding action plans, there are no major or
frequent discussions among MC members or hearings pro-
vided for local disability organizations (Tagaki, 2006). One
reason for this may be that service providers and MC mem-
bers belonging to disability organizations are often unaware
of the practical problems within their organizations because
they occupy managerial positions, away from the service
provision sites. According to the COGJ (2014c), only 11% of
local disability organization members are PWDs, of which
95% have physical disabilities. Ergo, another reason for the
lack of discussions might be that people with intellectual dis-
abilities or mental disorders comprise a very small propor-
tion of the local organization membership.
Tagaki (2006) found that MC members with disabilities
are often reluctant to discuss their personal interests regard-
ing disability or share their opinions about other types of
disability with other members. Furthermore, insufficient
discussions across the types of disability might occur
because the disability welfare system addresses three dis-
ability categories: physical, intellectual, and mental.
Physical disabilities encompass four categories: mobility,
visual, hearing and speech, and internal (e.g., heart disease,
kidney disease, or other chronic debilitations). MC mem-
bers have difficulty finding common ground across the dif-
ferent types of disability within this system. When they try
to find common needs, they tend to be compelled to discuss
their personal experiences in detail. However, Japanese
society considers disabilities as private matters that should
not be discussed with people whose disabilities differ
(Iwakuma, 2003). Therefore, MC members with disabilities
might be reluctant to share their experiences with each
other. In addition, these behaviors of MC members may
Tagaki 3
reflect the Japanese tradition of respecting harmony
(Iwakuma, 2014) as valuing harmony encourages conflict
avoidance and agreement among members.
RMs With Local Government
Representatives
Some municipal governments started holding regular RMs
on disability policy to hear opinions of and encourage par-
ticipation by PWDs in policy making. An RM consists of
local officials, researchers, and nonprofessionals, such as
PWDs, their families, and volunteer activists, selected by
local governments. Unlike focus groups, which are imple-
mented to collect opinions as data, RMs aim to listen to resi-
dent opinions to prioritize those opinions and use them to
develop agreements.
Tagaki (2007) studied a series of RMs held by a local gov-
ernment in a rural city in western Japan that spanned nearly
2 years. While participating in the meetings, he employed an
action research methodology (see Sugiman, 2006) and the
sense-making theory (see Weick, 1995) to evaluate them--
focusing, in particular, on the problems discussed. Although
local officials attended such meetings, they were reluctant to
conduct them; therefore, medical doctors and academic pro-
fessionals typically led the meetings. Many of the attendees
had disabilities. The main topics discussed were establishing
a newsletter, developing a website, creating a forum on dis-
ability issues in the city, and supporting employment oppor-
tunities for PWDs.
Tagaki (2007) believed that using group dynamics and
community organization theories (Ross, 1955) improved the
RMs and enhanced the process by which members partici-
pated in the RMs. Ross (1955) argued that three organiza-
tional aspects are important to consider when researching a
community organization: task, process, and relationship.
After analyzing the RMs based on those three aspects, Tagaki
(2007) discovered that the goals of the meetings (e.g., estab-
lishing a newsletter) were not accomplished because partici-
pation was lacking, meeting preparation was inadequate, and
supporting documentation was insufficient. Tagaki (2007)
pointed out that his role, as a researcher, was to understand
the members' discussions, whereas that of the members was
to describe accurately their experiences. He further sug-
gested that researchers in this field should focus on mem-
bers' narratives regarding matters they believed should be
discussed to provide local governmental officials with sug-
gestions for disability policy.
Despite Tagaki's (2007) contribution, additional RMs
should be analyzed to learn which issues are discussed and
how members address them. Such an analysis could help
resolve problems that interfere with successful meetings,
such as a reluctance to share personal experiences. Moreover,
it is important to study meetings that convene regularly for 5
or more years because the effective terms of basic action
plans for disability policy are 5 and 10 years (Tagaki, 2006).
Action Research and Narrative
In addition to Ross's (1955) theory, the current study employs
the action research (Lewin, 1948) and sense-making theories
(Weick, 1995), which were based on narrative theory to
group dynamics in organizational development. Each theory
is suitable for analyzing the results of fieldwork that includes
intensive interaction between members and a researcher.
Sense-making theory is appropriate to examine member
involvement in the RMs at behavioral or linguistic levels.
Nagata (2013) observed that Lewin (1948) focused on
group dynamics in organizational development, such as the
dynamic relationship between leadership and prevention of
human errors. Lewin influenced research on children's
development and learning through expansion based on activ-
ity theory (e.g., Engestrom, 1987). This approach has been
applied in studies on residents' participation in community
organizations (Hanny & O'Connor, 2013) and health profes-
sionals in local governments (Noro, 2012). These studies
examined the development of members' perceptions of their
activities as well as the outcome of their activities.
Accordingly, I might argue that Ross's (1955) three organi-
zational aspects are closely tied to Lewin's action research.
This type of action research has been used in Japan to
learn about individuals in communities using the sense-mak-
ing theory (Weick, 1995). Sense-making is a process by
which people retrospectively give meaning to their experi-
ences through narratives. Weick (1995) developed the theory
to analyze narratives in decision-making processes, such as
the problem-solving, judgment, or determination processes
in organizations. Decision making is a product of the sense-
making process because decisions are based on meanings.
For example, if an organizational member narrates that his
decision making led to a positive result, that narrative is the
process of retrospectively giving meaning to the decision-
making process. Weick was greatly influenced by Bruner's
(1986) narrative theory--pointing out that organizational
sense-making is a process that creates policy for future
behavior, rather than merely recalling past events or inter-
preting experiences. Furthermore, sense-making is not an
individual's inner monologue, but rather a social dialogue
that develops in response to other's agreements or objections
(Miyamoto & Atsumi, 2009; Yamori, 2008). Some examples
of action research using Weick's theory include investiga-
tions of conflict among residents during the merger of two
municipal governments (Higashimura, 2006) and the recon-
struction of disaster areas (Miyamoto, 2015). The sense-
making theory is suitable for analyzing RMs in this study.
In the process of sense-making, people begin to notice
self-evident norms or use explicit stories to explain what
they have implicitly understood (Sugiman, 2006). Instead of
teaching PWDs the professional, academic knowledge,
action research with sense-making teaches them how to
make sense of their, as well as other members', actions and
opinions (Tagaki, 2007). Therefore, the sense-making theory
4 SAGE Open
is consistent with the current trend of using narrative analy-
ses in disability studies (Smith & Sparkes, 2008). Bruner
(1986) proposed that people think paradigmatically to under-
stand the so-called scientific truth and, through narratives, to
develop meanings from their experiences. Although Bruner
stated that these two ways of thinking are reciprocal, narra-
tives focus on sense-making. In addition, disability narra-
tives correspond to illness narratives (Kleinman, 1988),
which relates to how the meanings of PWD differ from those
of experts.
Moreover, sense-making theory is useful for researcher
reflections on his or her own position in a project. As men-
tioned above, significant interactions occur between investi-
gators and research participants in action research studies.
Oliver (1997) argued that, regardless of research design,
researchers are incapable of adopting a neutral stance--
opposing the positivist paradigm that researchers can main-
tain objectivity. In action research, the descriptions of
fieldwork and the data analyses are influenced by (if not
based on) researchers' perspectives (Sugiman, 2006). This
suggests that researchers who use action research designs
should reflect on their personal values, as well as the roles
expected of them by their research participants. Researchers
who have used action research point out that some extent of
member involvement depends on the nature of the particular
research project (Seekins & White, 2013; Yamori, 2010).
This study's main objective was to understand the devel-
opmental process of a particular series of RMs. These meet-
ings resolved some of the problems revealed by previous
research, accomplished the three goals explained by Ross
(1955), and spanned more than 5 years. The second objective
was to examine the extent to which participation in the meet-
ings changed the meeting members' perspectives or attitudes
toward themselves and other people regarding disabilities.
Finally, the study examined the role and function of an action
researcher in the RMs.
Method
Context
Yao City, Osaka, Japan. The RMs were held in Yao city in the
suburban area of Osaka in western Japan. I was a member of
the advisory staff. Currently, Yao's population is approxi-
mately 270,000, of which nearly 15,000 (about 5.5% of the
population) have disabilities (Yao City, 2016). Human rights
movements, including those concerning disability issues, are
active in the city.
First-term and second-term Yao action plans for disability pol-
icy. The first-term Yao action plan was effective from 1998
to 2002 (Yao City, 1998), and the second-term plan, effective
from 2003 to 2007, was discussed at the Yao council for dis-
ability policy (hereafter referred to as "the Yao Council")
during the 2002 fiscal year (FY; Yao City, 2003). The Yao
Council, a high-ranking disability policy entity that works
with organizations, promotes, manages, and evaluates the
progress of the action plans. The first-term action plan was
implemented based on the results of surveys of residents
with disabilities or their parents and a hearing for PWDs who
were members of Yao disability organizations. However, the
disability section of the Yao government was concerned that
discussions at the Yao Council would privilege professional
or organizational knowledge because of the composition of
its membership and its results would not reflect the opinions
of residents with disabilities.
Establishment of RMs on disability issues. The second-term Yao
action plan was discussed at the Yao Council (Yao City,
2003; during FY 2002). The disability section suggested to
the Yao Council that RMs be held to solve the disability
issues and collect opinions from PWDs, welfare practitio-
ners, and volunteer activists (Yao City, 2003). The section
explained that the meetings would also help members and
local officials avoid mutual criticism, arrive at compromises,
and avoid PWD overdependence on the public sector. The
Yao Council agreed and suggested launching a series of
meetings, the first of which was held on July 27, 2002. In
addition, the members annually held a citizen's forum on dis-
ability issues with the Yao government and welfare organiza-
tions that did not attend RMs.
Although the stated purpose of the RM was initially lim-
ited to drafting a disability policy to be inserted into the sec-
ond-term action plan (which began in 2003), the meeting
members wanted the meetings to continue from FY 2003
onward to promote opinion-changing dialogue. Hence, the
RM became a subordinate organization to the Yao Council.
As of October 14, 2016, the Yao Council had conducted
RMs for 15 years. During this time, the RM has dealt with
various disability issues such as employment, public aware-
ness of PWDs, and accessibility on public roads. I have been
involved since the first meeting in 2002. The total number of
members is currently 25, with a membership term of 1 year,
although members can be reappointed. Members include
individuals with physical disabilities, mild intellectual dis-
abilities, or mental disorders in remission; the families of
PWDs; and the members of a sign language club. With my
exception, none of the members has concurrently held a post
on the Yao Council (I became a member of the council in
April 2002). In this study, I analyzed the development of the
RM from FYs 2002 to 2007--the effective period of the sec-
ond-term action plan for the disability policy.
Data Collection: Participant Observation and
Focus Group Interviews
My continuing participation in the meetings made me realize
their importance and, in 2003, I determined that they were
suitable subjects for an action research project. Because my
interest in the meetings grew gradually, I cannot specify the
Tagaki 5
exact start date of this study. Yamori (2010) stated that it is
not always possible to identify the beginning and end dates
of action research projects.
The data used in this study include field notes, handouts,
emails, transcripts of RM proceedings, and focus group inter-
view data. In my field notes, I wrote down progress of RMs, key
members'statements, member discussions, my own reflections,
and member reactions. I lived in a city that is approximately 30
km by train fromYao city.Yao city officials requested my active
involvement in the Yao Council and the RMs as an advisor.
Perhaps they thought I should fill two roles: first, as an aca-
demic professional, I would chair meetings and not interact with
disability organizations; and, second, as a person with a physical
disability, the officials thought I would be welcomed by RM
members. My physical disability enabled me to express solidar-
ity with RM members and avoid common criticisms--directed
at academic professionals in similar contexts (Tagaki, 2006)
Yao city officials might expect me to give advice that was based
on my personal experience as well as academic knowledge.
My age was another factor. In 2002, I was 27 years old,
which made me younger than most researchers in senior
positions at Japanese universities (Lebra, 2004). The Yao
city officials probably thought that my youthfulness would
promote a friendly atmosphere that might encourage open
discussions among the members.
In addition to attending the meetings, I conducted two
focus groups in the fall of 2007 with six key members of the
RM who had actively managed the meetings. Three of them
had mobility or visual disabilities, two were supporters of Yao
city residents with hearing loss, and one person was a psychi-
atric social worker. I conducted the focus group interviews in
a conference room in Yao city; however, no Yao official
attended them. Before each interview, I thoroughly explained
the study's research objectives and privacy policy, which was
to preserve carefully the data and use pseudonyms for all par-
ticipants in all publications. In addition, I provided members
with written explanations, although they all seemed to under-
stand my oral explanation. I emphasized that they could
refuse to participate whenever they wanted for any reason,
and they could leave the interview at any time. Each focus
group spanned about 2 hr, and the interviews were audio
recorded with the members' permission. The ethics commit-
tee of the relevant university approved the study protocol.
In the focus group interviews, I asked members to describe
their expectations of the RMs between 2002 and 2007, how
they led the meetings, and their understanding of Yao city
officials'roles. Furthermore, I asked them to elaborate on the
opinion that PWDs should do as much as they can by them-
selves without depending on the public sector. In the second
focus group, I asked the members to elaborate on the main
topics discussed in the first focus group and the RM's limita-
tions. Before submission, I asked Yao officials and some key
members of the RM to review the draft and requested that all
focus group members check the descriptions and quotations
of the focus group results via email or telephone.
Data Analysis
The analysis of the meeting process was based on written
resources, such as handouts delivered by Yao city officials,
my emails with the officials, and my field notes. Records of
my interventions in all the processes were extracted from the
sources, following which the meeting process clarified my
involvement. Regarding focus group interviews, I employed
"the KJ method," a kind of bottom-up qualitative method
that was developed by a Japanese ethnologist, Jiro Kawakita
(1967). He adapted this method from Charles S. Peirce's
notion of abduction, which relies on intuitive thinking pro-
cesses to identify explanatory hypotheses (Scupin, 1997).
The KJ method contains some general steps: reading tran-
scripts carefully, extracting quotations from the transcripts,
assigning a code (a summary label or index) to each quota-
tion, developing categories by grouping codes, and summa-
rizing categories and relationships among them.
I applied this standard procedure of the KJ method. First,
I carefully reviewed the transcripts to gain an overall sense
of the focus groups. Second, I linked 138 codes to 147 quota-
tions extracted from the transcripts, as some quotations were
assigned the same code. The quotations were each three or
four sentences long. Third, I provisionally grouped and orga-
nized the coded quotations and summarized them into about
20 groups, which described, for example, mutual respect
among the members, dialogue with the officials, or the meet-
ings' proceedings. Finally, from these groups, I developed
main categories, which are described in the section of
"Results of the Focus Group Interviews".
Nochi (2013) suggested that there are similarities between
the KJ method and grounded theory methodology (Glaser &
Strauss, 1967). Both develop connections among categories
using codes generated from segmented text data. However,
there are some differences between them. The goal of the
grounded theory methodology is to logically develop and
integrate categories into a theory, whereas that of the KJ
method is to create new connections between ideas or con-
cepts that could create contradictory or illogical categories.
Nochi suggested that the KJ method is suitable for analyzing
self-narratives because narratives tend to include many con-
tradictions or inconsistencies. Unique to Japan, this is a pop-
ular qualitative analytical method in many fields, including
developmental psychology (Sato, Hidaka, & Fukuda, 2009;
Tagaki, 2015) and gerontology (Fukui, Okada, Nishimoto, &
Nelson-Becker, 2011).
Results of the Meeting Processes
First, I provide a brief description of my remarks to the meet-
ing members. Second, I present the RM process as three
phases across time (Table 1): the initiatives of Yao city offi-
cials and leading residents, collaborations among the officials
and other members of the RM, and results and conclusions
(comprising the last year of the effective period of the
6 SAGE Open
second-term action plan for the disability policy), which are
based on the agenda and key meeting leaders. The Yao city
government structured the meetings by FY. In the first phase,
the officials chairing the meetings developed an agenda and
provided it to me in advance. In the second phase, they created
individual meeting scenarios and asked key RM members to
initiate discussions. The third phase encompassed reflections
and conclusions about the effects of these meetings on disabil-
ity issues. Following the description of these phases, I present
the main categories of the focus group interview data.
Over this 6-year period, the RM has accomplished the fol-
lowing tasks and goals: managing the annual citizen forum,
selecting equipment and events for the city center for PWDs,
improving pedestrian accessibility on sidewalks by address-
ing the issue of illegally parked bicycles, using products
made in sheltered workshops to promote employment of
PWDs, and increasing a community's awareness of PWDs.
In addition to these concrete issues, the RM members deep-
ened their mutual understanding of disability-related issues,
took on leadership roles in the meetings, and participated in
disability-related activities.
My Role as a Researcher
At the request of Yao city officials, I acted as an RM advisor
and coordinator. I believed that RMs carried potential for
developing collaborative solutions for disability issues
between municipal governments and the residents. I consid-
ered my interactions with PWDs to be important to my previ-
ous research, which focused on the psychosocial issues
related to disabilities.
The Yao city officials did not provide clear guidance
regarding what I should do or what types of policies they
wanted to implement. In the beginning, my role seemed to
include promoting opinion exchanges among members,
organizing the expressed opinions, and emphasizing the
members' power as laypersons. First, I asked all the mem-
bers to respect the disabilities and opinions of others because
there were numerous types of disabilities among them. Due
to this diversity, I expected it to be difficult to reach simple
agreements. I suggested that, when the members wanted to
give more than one statement, they should first listen care-
fully at least once to another opinion. I reiterated that their
opinions as laypersons with disabilities were more important
than the ideas presented by the experts and officials. This
was intended to help the members feel free to share their
opinions. These suggestions seemed to be accepted by the
members during discussions. Through my emphasis on the
value of their opinions, I tried to communicate to them that
self-reliance was better than excessive dependency on the
municipal government, which was an explicit goal of the
RM. While some of them supported this idea, others might
have thought that it reflected the intentions of the Yao city
government, which could have been interested in decreasing
their disability benefits.
Overall, I believe that I was regarded as a key member of
the RM. The meetings were often conveniently held with my
schedule in mind. Sometimes, members showed solidarity
with me as a person with a disability, and they often respected
my suggestions. However, some members regarded me as an
associate of the Yao city government, while others regarded
me as someone unfamiliar with the city's local affairs.
Initiatives of the Yao City Officials and Leading
Residents
FY 2002. In FY 2002, the members discussed a proposal for
an action plan on disability policy that focused on the resi-
dents' initiatives. They attempted to identify problems and
solutions and determine the roles of the municipal govern-
ment and PWDs. In this phase, organizing the members was
the first challenge. In 2002 and 2003, Yao city officials clas-
sified the members based on their type of disability (physical,
hearing loss, intellectual, or mental) and volunteer activist
status. This classification encouraged discussions and conver-
sations because the members were asked to introduce them-
selves, write about their disability issues, and share their
personal experiences and solutions with each other.
During this process, the members began to understand their
problems or needs and, consequently, increased their respect for
others' opinions. For example, people with mobility or visual
disabilities listened carefully to the remarks of persons with
hearing loss, mental disorders, or intellectual disabilities, and
sometimes spoke particularly slowly to them. Similarly, mem-
bers paid more attention to sign language translators. Moreover,
some members recognized the variation in disabilities within
the groups. For example, people with physical disabilities (the
group in which I participated) included a woman with a visual

disability, man with a spinal cord injury, man with a paralyzed
limb, and woman with kidney disease. These individuals shared
their personal struggles, such as those in terms of overcoming
structural barriers, learning Braille, and experiencing dialysis
treatments. Because of the variety of disabilities in the group, it
was difficult to reach consensus on any policy change.
The members concluded the last meeting of 2002, by dis-
cussing the year's results. Many members mentioned the
importance of having people with diverse disabilities come
together, and they wanted to continue the meetings despite
the challenges faced in exchanging opinions. Although many
of their ideas were added to the action plan, some were not.
For example, although the idea of having a 24-hr emergency
support system for people with mental disorders was sup-
ported by some members, it was not included. The members
reported their opinions at the citizens' forum.
FY 2003. Along with Yao city officials and some of the lead-
ing members, I decided to participate in the RM for the sec-
ond-term action plan. In the first meeting, some members
expressed concern that it was difficult for them to develop an
agenda suitable to the RM. One member pointed out that
intense discussion would be meaningless if the officials did
not formulate them into a policy, suggesting the limitations
of the RM. Subsequently, the officials and members chose to
discuss a new city center for PWDs, the types of equipment
that would be needed in such a center, and the types of events
that could be held there.
In the last meeting of 2003, the members discussed the
results of the year's meetings. Some members suggested that
we should create an enterprise, rather than merely talking
about things. Furthermore, the members suggested that the
meetings should be structured by establishing an agenda,
assigning leaders, and keeping a written record.
Collaborations Between the Officials and Leading
Residents: 2004 to 2006
FY 2004.In the first meeting of 2004, some key members
organized a task force comprised of residents, officials, and
myself. The goal of the task force was to set up agendas in
advance of the coming year's meetings and assign a person
to lead the meetings. The key members of the task force were
a man with a spinal cord injury (Mr. A), a woman with a
visual disability (Ms. B), a person with a mental disorder,
and some able-bodied volunteers and activists.
Ms. B explained the purpose of the RM to the other task
force members and the meeting at large, stating, "I strongly
ask you to realize that this meeting is an opportunity not for
you to make demands of the Yao government but to express
ideas that the members can carry out on their own." She
seemed to want to prevent the meetings from developing into
negotiations between officials and disability activists. After
careful deliberations, the task force decided to classify the
RM members without considering their disabilities.
After the first RM, the task force members, officials, and
I decided to add to the agenda the problems faced by PWDs
in integrating themselves into the community. In addition, at
the fifth meeting of 2004, the members decided to start a
campaign to prevent the illegal parking of bicycles on side-
walk and implement security sweeps of public buildings
(scheduled to begin after 2004), such as railway stations,
because illegally parked bicycles were creating dangerous
obstacles for the PWDs, particularly sight-impaired or
wheelchair-bound individuals. As described in the following
section, the proposal regarding bicycle parking was accepted
by the Yao government.
FY 2005. The task force members suggested that the employ-
ment problems, illegally parked bicycles, and a disability
awareness campaign should be covered in the 2005 meeting
agenda. At the first RM, members agreed that the first two
concerns would be included in the agenda. We learned at the
meeting that the members were unaware of any employment
programs within the Yao city government, the quota system,
or the equal opportunity policy within Japan; these programs
and policies encompassed the informational categories that
PWDs need to improve their employment opportunities.
In spring 2005, some members submitted a draft on the
bicycle problem to Yao city to apply for an official grant pro-
moting a community-based welfare program for PWDs in
the city. The city accepted the proposal. Even though the RM
did not officially approve the draft and its associated cam-
paign, these members produced a result that originated from
RM discussions.
At the last meeting of 2005, the members discussed pos-
sible reasons for not finding an effective solution to the
employment problem. One opinion was that only a few RM
members had employment experience. The officials and I
noticed some positive changes in the members that accompa-
nied the RM developmental changes. For example, one
member with a mental disorder who always came accompa-
nied by a social worker participated in some discussions
when he was not accompanied. Another member, with a
physical disability, who had emphasized during the first
phase that the government should take responsibility even
for personal disabilities, stated that PWDs should attempt to
resolve their issues without government support.
FY 2006. In 2006, the task force set the agenda for the first
and second meetings to address an activity at a sheltered
workshop for PWDs as well as an employment and disability
awareness program in the community. At the first RM, the
members learned about a sheltered workshop from guest
speakers, who had been trained to bake goods at the work-
shop. The members suggested that they could deliver baked
goods made at the workshop to elders living in a welfare
facility. They thought that this service was an example of the
improvements in the sales of goods produced in workshops.2
After the first meeting, some of the RM members served as
8 SAGE Open
intermediaries between a sheltered workshop and a welfare
facility for elders to promote the delivery of goods.
At the second meeting, the members discussed the fact
that the job skills required by PWDs were not clearly
defined, and, in addition, they considered the types of jobs
that PWDs could perform. Some members stated that hav-
ing a coordinator to mediate between a person with disabili-
ties and his or her employer would be beneficial. Many
members emphasized that PWDs should stress their
strengths instead of their limitations. One member sug-
gested that PWDs could consult enterprises regarding the
construction of barrier-free buildings and disability aware-
ness educational programs, or they could be customer ser-
vice representatives specifically for PWDs.
Mr. C, who had previously worked for a large company
and sustained a physical disability, told the members that the
unique strengths of PWDs are not broadly suitable to the
labor market and private enterprises do not want to employ
PWDs. As I listened, I felt concerned that his emphasis on
employers' perspectives might discourage other members.
Our conversation3 is as follows:
Mr. C: Truly, a private company is legally required to
employ PWD as a certain percentage of all employees.
But, the real situation is that it does not want to employ
even one person with a disability. . . . PWD have to
know what an employer needs; otherwise, any support
plans for employment would turn out to be nothing but
pie in the sky.
Me: I asked you to share your opinion after all the mem-
bers had each expressed their opinions. It sounds rea-
sonable that the situation of a company is different
from that of a person with disabilities. Would you
share your long-term work experience later?
Mr. C: I understand.
At the sixth meeting, we deliberated on disability aware-
ness programs in the community. At the seventh meeting, I
proposed that we deliberate on the targets or effects of such
programs. Ms. B. argued that it is difficult to focus on the
targets or examine the programs' effects:
Ms. B: Professor [me] pointed out the effectiveness of the
disability awareness program, but we cannot start the
program if we still have to consider it. We held the pro-
gram for students at school, and we know that even
though we sowed 100 seeds, one or two of them would
sprout up.
Me: I do not mean effectiveness; rather, I mean that we
have to clarify what is understood and what is not.
Ms. B: [It is impossible for us to put a line between them].
Let me refute. I guess that this is something that stu-
dents learn about in some way [from the program].
This is quite different from a professional lecture at a
university.
The main result of the 2006 meetings was our decision to
continue the regular delivery of baked goods to the welfare
facility for elders. Although the members of the RM did not
define elders as PWD, this activity could be interpreted as
their effort to bridge the welfare services for PWDs and those
for elders.
Results and Conclusions: FY 2007
At the 2007 meetings, we summarized the development of
the meetings over the previous 5 years. At the fifth meeting
of 2007, members stressed the need to strengthen relation-
ships in the RM across disabilities and continue campaigning
to prevent the illegal parking of bicycles. Some of the mem-
bers voiced the concern that the meetings had not represented
or assisted the PWDs who were not in attendance and the
task force shouldered too heavy a burden. The members
reached a consensus that the RM should continue after 2007,
that they should have more control of the meetings, and that
the Yao city officials should have less control. I asked them
whether they would go ahead with the meetings on their
own, stressing my belief that their personal initiative was of
greater importance than that of the Yao Council members,
who did not fully understand the situations discussed at the
RM. The officials and I reported the decision to the 2007 Yao
Council meeting and received approval to continue the RM
from 2008 onward without any objections.
Results of the Focus Group Interviews
The data from the focus group interviews were developed
into four broad categories using the KJ method: (a) inter-
viewees' understanding of disabilities, (b) dialogues with
Yao city officials, (c) difficulty in setting up agendas that
were interesting and relevant to all the members, and (d)
advantages of the RM compared with the Yao Council.
Interviewees' Understanding of Disabilities
The focus group interviewees stated that the RM lasted 6
years because the members mutually respected each other's
opinions. Some of them pointed out that they had initially
joined the RM only to express their personal needs. Ms. D, a
member of a small support group for people with hearing
disabilities, stated that she had perceived the RM as an
opportunity to highlight the concerns of her group.
However, as the RM progressed, the members became
less focused on the interests of particular groups, began to
appreciate the people with various disabilities who had gath-
ered, and became eager to take advantage of the valuable
opportunity. The project aiming to prevent the illegal parking
of bicycles unified the entire membership. The interviewees
stated that if they wanted officials to consider their expressed
issues as credible, they needed to highlight the commonali-
ties among all PWDs.
Tagaki 9
Some interviewees pointed out that the members who
were responsive to other members were those who were
likely to continue participating in the RM. Ms. B mentioned
people with visual disabilities becoming involved in issues
related to those with intellectual disabilities. The members'
narratives in the focus group interviews are illustrated as
follows:
Ms. B: If a person with [a] visual disability thought he
had nothing in common with the issues of intellec-
tual disabilities, he could not go to a nursing institu-
tion for elders to sell bakery goods made by people
with intellectual disabilities. I am sure that the staff
at the institution was surprised to see me. It is quite
irregular.
Dialogues With Yao City Officials
The interviewees stated that they tried to avoid confronta-
tions with officials and disregarded what they perceived as
unrealistic, one-sided demands made by the officials
because they believed that a disability policy exclusively
developed by officials would either be incomplete or even-
tually become useless. They were pleased that the officials
gave them space to freely express their opinions. One
interviewee pointed out that the officials and members
attempted to understand each other's importance in the
process and they realized that it was necessary for the offi-
cials to participate in the meetings. They stated that if the
officials were to stop participating, the collaboration they
had established would become worthless. Mr. F pointed
out as follows:
Mr. F: The local governments' involvement helps us to
persuade public organizations, such as a company or
an administrative organization. They cannot help lis-
tening to our requests. Because of the presence of the
government in the meeting, the persuasion is not a per-
sonal activity, but a public one.
Difficulty in Setting Up Agendas That Were
Interesting and Relevant to All Members
The interviewees told me that they had carefully devel-
oped agendas of interest to all members; to this end, they
had actively avoided putting a national disability policy
on the agenda. No practical solution to such a concern
could be developed at a municipal-level meeting. Instead,
they aimed for small and practical issues that the local
government had not yet addressed. The Yao city officials
stated that they knew little of many salient issues. Mr. F
remarked, "Because we discuss realistic methods, the
members in the discussion can be enthusiastic about
becoming involved in the project and can propose alterna-
tive methods."
Advantages of the RM Compared With the Yao
Council
The interviewees emphasized their beliefs that they were
more valuable than the members of the Yao Council because
their discussions were based on experience, rather than
abstract ideas. They valued their freedom to share their expe-
riences easily without considering disability organizations'
interests because they participated in the meetings as indi-
viduals with disabilities, instead of organizational represen-
tatives. The interviewees stated that, initially, they did not
know the original purpose of the RM or understand the dis-
ability action plan; however, they gradually understood the
advantages of the RM compared with the Yao Council. For
example, Mr. A stated that although he had been invited to
attend the meetings by officials, he did not know their pur-
pose. However, the interviewees pointed out that, as the RM
progressed, there were several noteworthy changes among
the members. Some members began to understand each other
better after attending several meetings. Some of the inter-
viewees were unsure about the advantages, stating that it was
difficult to evaluate the Yao disability policy. In addition,
they pointed out that they could not do what they actually
wanted to do, but had to go along with the consensus. For
example, they could not educate companies about disabili-
ties, learn about the skills sought by such companies, or help
PWDs obtain these skills.
Discussion
Accomplishment of Task Goal
We could conclude that the RM accomplished its task goals
because members obtained concrete results from their active
involvement in the management of annual citizen forums on
disability issues, the selection of equipment and events of a city
center for PWDs, the development of the campaign to increase
pedestrian accessibility by cracking down on illegally parked
bicycles, utilization of products made in a sheltered workshop
to promote employment for PWDs, and development of com-
munity awareness of PWDs. One could certainly argue that the
current RM was more successful than Tagaki's RM in 2007.
Although there are similar city center facilities in Japan, it is
rare that residents with disabilities take part in selection of cen-
ter events--Typically local government officials or center staff
are responsible for this selection. Illegal parking on sidewalks
was a major problem for accessibility in public transit facilities,
like railway stations or bus stops, or entrances to stores. Even
though some municipal governments regulate bicycle parking
around transit facilities, the problem persists (Chosokabe,
Takeyoshi, & Sakakibara, 2015). In the current campaign,
PWDs appeal to residents as illegally parked bicycles create
problems for everyone, not PWDs alone. Through their
involvement in the bicycle project, residents without disabili-
ties gained a better understanding of disability issues. To pro-
mote public awareness of disability issues, the members edited
10 SAGE Open
contents of a booklet and presented lectures on it by them-
selves. This educational format may be more appealing for
audiences compared with other disability awareness activities
managed by disability professionals or academics.
Utilization of products of a sheltered workshop is a pio-
neering achievement. Marketing these workshop products
was one of major issues in disability employment. In fact,
many solutions had already been attempted--like consultant
participation in workshop management with social welfare
professionals or selling the products in a corner of large com-
mercial or public facilities (Toyama, 2017). The Act on
Priority Procurement Promotion for Persons With Disabilities
of 2012 (Japanese Law No. 50) was purposed to encourage
public organizations like the central and municipal govern-
ments to promote priority purchase from facilities for PWDs,
when procuring goods or services. Nevertheless, this Act did
not encourage similar purchases by welfare organizations for
the elderly or nursery homes, even though most welfare facil-
ities legally and financially are under jurisdiction of MHLW.
Accomplishment of Process Goal and Interaction
Among the Members
Emphasis on member disability diversity.We could conclude
that the RM partially accomplished its process goal, as--
based on my fieldwork and the analysis of the focus group
interviews--all members seemed to be very aware of their
diversity. Some scholars have suggested a hierarchy of dis-
ability or impairment(Charlton, 1998; Reeve, 2004) in social
positions, meaning that other PWDs consider an individual
with a particular disability as a person who sustains "real"
disability. A hierarchy would likely be an obstacle to achiev-
ing collaboration or solidarity among the members of the
RM; however, I did not observe this phenomenon. People
with physical disabilities seemed to pay equal attention to
those who had difficulty speaking due to intellectual or men-
tal disabilities. These members talked slowly, and the others
seemed to listen to their opinions. Iwakuma (2014) pointed
out that the culture of respecting "harmony" could prevent
PWDs from active discussion in a council in Japan. How-
ever, RM members might interpret talking about their own
experiences and listening to others' as respecting harmony in
the meeting. In this sense, one could argue that valuing har-
mony might prevent the member from remaining silent and,
instead, encourage active and respectful discussion among
the members. Furthermore, after 2004, RM members were
no longer categorized by disability, which may have contrib-
uted to changes in their perceptions or attitudes.
In the interviews, members pointed out that as time passed
they began to recognize common needs and opinions when
listening to others. Perhaps they began to understand the
value of presenting their common needs to people without
disabilities who are unfamiliar with disability issues,
although there was no consensus on the matter. National or
municipal disability movements tend to focus on specific
disabilities (COGJ, 2014a; Ibaraki, 2013); however, they
might be more successful if they were based on common
needs. The RM members valued the meetings where differ-
ent people came together, and they expressed concerns that
the RM would not be sustainable if the members spoke from
self-interest alone. Therefore, the agendas from 2004 to 2007
were mostly about issues common to all the members.
Development of disability identities. A concrete achievement of
the RM was the utilization of sheltered workshop products,
which developed an environment where members could
establish their disability identities (Gill, 1997). A disability
identity can be more empowering than a general social iden-
tity. Discussion of disability policy is a tool that encouraged
members to find relationships between their personal experi-
ences and the local disability policy as the exchange of these
experiences could lead to alternative dialogues on disability
issues. A typical example is the employment issue included
in the 2005 and 2006 agendas. PWDs are often exposed to
social perceptions that they do not have requisite abilities for
the labor market. Some believe that the Services and Support
for Persons With Disabilities Act of 2006 was proposed
exclusively for PWDs for employment or vocational training
purposes (Ozawa & Ohshima, 2012). Nevertheless, some
members stated that they should view their disability experi-
ences as a strength when seeking employment. PWDs seem
to share a perception that refutes the dominant ideas able-
bodied people have regarding PWD employment. As such,
RM members seemed to embrace a common experience of
disability and sense of belonging to the disability community
beyond their differences.
Milner and Kelly (2009) suggested that PWDs need
places like the RM for community life. In Japan, through
some financial support of municipal governments, disability
organizations held "peer counseling" practices where PWDs
are encouraged to talk actively about their disability-related
experiences (Sadato, 1994). However, not only are these
groups rare, but they are also typically short-lived and their
members lack diversity. Iwakuma (2003) found that people
who talk about their personal disability challenges might be
perceived as self-involved in places where people without
disabilities gather. At the RMs, members had no need to
worry about this and were able to talk comfortably about
their experiences. Gearty (2015) proposed that action
research about organizational members creates new narra-
tives for the members. In this sense, the current action
research study helped the RM to engage the disability com-
munity despite its initial official and solitary goal of discuss-
ing the municipal disability policy.
It is important to point out the differences and disagree-
ments among the members. Mr. C's remarks about employ-
ers' perspectives brought to light the differences in
perspectives between those with and those without employ-
ment experience. The RM atmosphere became tense after
his remarks. According to Kobayashi (2004), members in
Tagaki 11
consensus meetings (regarding environmental and food
safety issues) should be aware that disagreements among
members are unavoidable. Although Kobayashi's findings
might not perfectly fit this study, it is important to recognize
the need to "agree to disagree" in the context of disability
issues. A member with a disability cannot insist that his or
her remarks are more legitimate than those of other mem-
bers with different disabilities.
Management of the RM by the Members, Yao
City Officials, and a Researcher
Role of the members and Yao city officials. Many different peo-
ple led the RMs--Residents, local officials, and I all served
in this capacity, and we all considered our roles and limita-
tions. This current RM seems better managed by all the
members than the RM in Tagaki's (2007) study. Although
the residents became increasingly active in the RMs, local
officials and I filled the primary role of facilitating discus-
sions. Member participation in and contributions to the RMs
were noteworthy. For example, one task force member
focused on the RM management policy. Another example
includes members' responses to Ms. B, stating that she
should discuss practical issues rather than theoretical mat-
ters, and that her remarks were not useful to policy change.
These discussions enabled members to avoid focusing on
their personal concerns, respect the needs and opinions of
others as individuals, and consider the group in its entirety.
Local officials might consider the RM discussions as sig-
nificant. In the personnel allocation system of Japanese public
officials, local government officials transfer from one section
to another every 4 to 5 years, except for staff employed as
social welfare professionals. For this reason, local government
officials often do not have the opportunity to become intimately
familiar with disability policy matters (Kurihara, 2007). For the
RMs, the local officials played an important role--setting the
agenda and supporting the meeting chair--which helped mem-
bers better understand the relationships between the discus-
sions and policy. The Yao Council members regarded these
discussions as useful political recommendations.
The local officials recognize their administrative limita-
tions with regard to incorporating RM suggestions into policy.
In Japan, due to the decentralization of power, municipal gov-
ernment's ability to exert their own discretion with regard to
social welfare policy has been increasing since the 1990s (Ito,
2012). However, municipal governments have little adminis-
trative discretion to decide the content of welfare policy and
their own budget; in fact, municipal governments are required
to emphasize the intentions of prefectures and central govern-
ment. Even so, the attendance of the government officials at
the RMs is regarded favorably in part because the RM mem-
bers' discussion is easily transferrable to the Yao government.
In addition, their attendance fulfills the "public responsibility"
standard emphasized in Japan that pushes central or local gov-
ernments to take initiative on disability policy (Kim, 2014).
My role as a researcher. I attempted to manage several aspects
of the RMs, including membership, clarifying members'
roles, prioritizing meeting agendas, developing behavior
policies during discussions (such as refraining from criti-
cism), emphasizing that each member's experiences were
knowledge based, promoting the value of meetings, and
helping to find solutions to the problems identified in the
meetings without depending on the government. Based on
the sense-making theory, I intended my remarks to shed light
on the members' sense-making of their experiences as
PWDs. I did not present professional truths or offer solutions
for the members to implement.
I asked the RM members to explain their values or norms
of which other RM members might not be aware. In particu-
lar, I tried to clarify the significance of the members' com-
ments and emphasized that documenting the meetings was
important because sense-making is prominently performed
in narratives. Documentation is important for arranging nar-
ratives through discussion and encouraging the members'
interpretations of the RM. By documenting the meetings,
residents who were absent catch up on what happened.
Accordingly, my role in this action research study can be
understood as sense-making, rather than decision making.
I was uniquely aware that I was limited by my lack of Yao
city residency and, thus, had no official way of implementing
the members' suggestions. Furthermore, social scientists
rarely have strong influences on disability policy in Japan's
central or municipal governments, particularly compared with
governmental officials (Mizumoto, 2009).Arevolving door of
personnel through which researchers travel and transition
among universities, institutions, and policy making are
unusual in Japan's central and local governments (Ishii, 2010).
Perhaps if more researchers were involved in disability stud-
ies, their influence would increase and lead to positive changes
to the current disability policy in Japan (Barnes, 2011). In this
case, because Ms. B did not completely agree with my sugges-
tion on the target or effects of a disability awareness program
in the 2006 meeting, my advice as a researcher was not
accepted by the RM members. Nevertheless, the sense-mak-
ing of the narratives of the RM members might be a small step
toward a positive change.
Conclusion
An RM is an effective way for PWDs to participate in local
policy-making processes. The following are some sugges-
tions, which municipal governments should apply when
managing RMs. First, respect for diversity is required and,
once it is established, common interests will emerge. If
member categorization is based on disability type, they will
likely have strong within-group affinities. Under these con-
ditions, discussions may be too specific to disability type,
and cross-group relationships could be undermined.
Organizing members without considering the disability type
allows them to find new common ground. Respect for
12 SAGE Open
diversity does not mean enforced agreements. Members
could agree to disagree and subsequently find a common
ground on which to appeal to the local government.
Second, as Yanai and Nakayama (2015) pointed out, a
venue for sharing experiences is important, even if there is a
specific project in mind for the experience sharing. The RM
accomplished three concrete projects, but perhaps more
importantly, the members actively shared their experiences
with each other. The current RM did not reflect the opinions
of all the PWDs in Yao. Nevertheless, it is important to accu-
mulate and generate collective narratives on local disability
policy.As McDaid (2009) and Mirza, Gossett, Chan, Burford,
and Hammel (2008) insisted, a disability service provision
system should respect experience-based knowledge. Initially,
policy evaluation can be applied to retrospectively under-
stand its past effects. For example, in the context of restoring
a Japanese town damaged by a catastrophe, Miyamoto and
Atsumi (2009) emphasized the importance of the narrative
way of thinking. Their discussion is reflected in this study,
which also deals with residents facing community problems.
The third suggestion is that the meetings should be man-
aged by multiple leaders to encourage the participation of all
members. In this study, local officials, key residents, and I
collectively coordinated the RM.
It is important to note the limitations of the RM. As one
member with an internal disability remarked in 2003, it ran
the risk that deep discussions would be useless if the officials
did not value them. One goal of the RM has been to help
members understand their responsibilities toward themselves
and not become overly dependent on the government. If this
goal is misunderstood, the legitimate responsibilities of the
public sector could be underestimated. I suggest that the RM
is a means of enacting the disability policy. Certainly, lobby-
ing high-ranking officials or Congress members is effective
for prompt policy making.
Further studies are required on this topic. First, the RM
did not fulfill its relationship goal because it did not involve
able-bodied people unrelated to policy making or disability
issues generally. The Yao RM is continuing in 2016 and
some projects are going to be implemented in conjunction
with citizen groups in Yao city. Therefore, we should analyze
the development of the RM from the process goal. Second,
the local government must launch many official meetings,
such as the Committee of Service Provision and Council for
the Support of Community Life of People With Disabilities.
These activities will provide fresh opportunities to conduct
comprehensive and effective studies on RM and other types
of meetings.

Notes
1. In 2013, there were approximately 8,000 sheltered workshops
in Japan where people with disabilities (PWDs) made baked
goods and textiles, among other things (Ministry of Health,
Labour and Welfare, 2015). However, such products generally
have difficulty selling, and, therefore, many workshops are
using these types of markets.
2. The quotations from the members' narratives are based on my
field notes.
3. Japanese laws are numbered by calendar year and initiated
at the end of each year for the coming year. Therefore, the
People With Disabilities Employment Promotion Law and the
Services and Support for Persons With Disabilities Act have
the same number.
