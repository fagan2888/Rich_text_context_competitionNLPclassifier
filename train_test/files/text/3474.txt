Abstract: This article reviews etiological and comparative evidence supporting the
hypothesis that some genes associated with the autism spectrum were naturally selected and
represent the adaptive benefits of being cognitively suited for solitary foraging. People on
the autism spectrum are conceptualized here as ecologically competent individuals that
could have been adept at learning and implementing hunting and gathering skills in the
ancestral environment. Upon independence from their mothers, individuals on the autism
spectrum may have been psychologically predisposed toward a different life-history
strategy, common among mammals and even some primates, to hunt and gather primarily
on their own. Many of the behavioral and cognitive tendencies that autistic individuals
exhibit are viewed here as adaptations that would have complemented a solitary lifestyle.
For example, the obsessive, repetitive and systemizing tendencies in autism, which can be
mistakenly applied toward activities such as block stacking today, may have been focused
by hunger and thirst toward successful food procurement in the ancestral past. Both solitary
mammals and autistic individuals are low on measures of gregariousness, socialization,
direct gazing, eye contact, facial expression, facial recognition, emotional engagement,
affiliative need and other social behaviors. The evolution of the neurological tendencies in
solitary species that predispose them toward being introverted and reclusive may hold
important clues for the evolution of the autism spectrum and the natural selection of autism
genes. Solitary animals are thought to eschew unnecessary social contact as part of a
foraging strategy often due to scarcity and wide dispersal of food in their native
environments. It is thought that the human ancestral environment was often nutritionally
sparse as well, and this may have driven human parties to periodically disband.
Inconsistencies in group size must have led to inconsistencies in the manner in which
natural selection fashioned the social minds of humans, which in turn may well be
responsible for the large variation in social abilities seen in human populations. This article
emphasizes that individuals on the autism spectrum may have only been partially solitary,
that natural selection may have only favored subclinical autistic traits and that the most
severe cases of autism may be due to assortative mating.

Autism and Natural Selection
Autism is a condition that affects individuals from birth or infancy and is diagnosed
on the basis of three primary symptoms: social deficits, impaired communication and
stereotyped and repetitive behaviors (Piven, 2000). People with autism largely withdraw
from social contact and become absorbed in private worlds of obsessive interests and
repetitious activities (Kelly, Garnett, Attwood, and Peterson, 2008). Autism has been
shown to be highly heritable and has been associated with a number of both genetic and
environmental risk factors (Cantor, 2009). It is thought that the genes associated with
autism create very selective abnormalities that tend to affect brain regions associated with
social cognition (Amaral, Schumann, and Nordahl, 2008). Unfortunately, the genetics,
molecular biology and neuroscience of autism are still, relative to many other neurological
disorders, shrouded with uncertainty due to their highly complex nature (O'Roak and State,
2008).
A portion of this complexity and uncertainty arises from the relatively large number
of distinct susceptibility genes that have been identified, many of which can be completely
absent even in pronounced autism (Freitag, 2007). This genetic heterogeneity may be
responsible for the clinical heterogeneity, which ranges from debilitating social deficits to
minor personality traits (Caronna, Milunsky, and Tager-Flusberg, 2008). Medical science
recognizes certain phenotypes that are thought to lie on a continuum often referred to as the
autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Of these disorders, the DSM recognizes: autistic
disorder (Kanner's autism), childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental
disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS, or atypical autism) (Piven, 2000). Autistic
disorder itself has also been broken into 4 subgroups: Asperger syndrome the highest-
functioning form (Asperger, 1944; Frith, 1991), autism, high-functioning and low-
functioning autism (Kanner, 1943; Baron-Cohen, 2006). Geneticists report that although
the clinical distinctions do not map neatly onto specific genes or patterns of genes, lower
functioning individuals may have a higher total number of susceptibility alleles (Abrahams
and Geschwind, 2008). For this reason this article will not make evolutionary distinctions
between individual autistic disorders but will focus on the autism spectrum and the range of
related genes as a whole.
A number of very different theories about the causes of autism have attempted to
explain the scattered facts. It has been difficult for theorists to create a grand synthesis, and
autism has been reconceptualized many times. At one point, it was thought that autistic
children were purely a result of poor parenting, an idea that was once widely embraced but
is now utterly rejected (Baron-Cohen and Bolton, 1993). Autism is now known to be a
biological phenomenon in which a genetic diathesis or susceptibility may interact with
early environmental circumstances to determine the severity of outcome (Kumar and
Christian, 2009). However, why this genetic susceptibility to autism is so prevalent and
how the genes persisted despite the perceived negative effects is unclear. It is the author's
The solitary forager hypothesis

view that conceptualizing autism in terms of evolutionary biology will offer insight into the
underlying factors, and help to make sense out of its seemingly incongruous characteristics.
The risk of developing autism approaches .5 percent in the general population,
making it a highly prevalent "disorder" from an evolutionary perspective (Gluckman,
Beedle, and Hanson, 2009). In the past two decades alone, the incidence of ASD has
increased from 2-5 to 15-70 per 10,000 children, a dramatic increase, which is attributed to
heightened attention by the medical community as well as the broadening of diagnostic
criteria (King and Bearman, 2009; Fombonne, 2009). Disorders, like autism, that are so
prevalent that they exceed common mutation rates are thought to have persisted because
the genes responsible for them conferred some advantage in the ancestral environment
(Nesse and Williams, 1998). To fully understand the evolutionary provenance of such a
syndrome it is important to attain a rough date of its origins in natural history.
For years autism was thought to be a disorder that affected Caucasians exclusively.
If this had in fact been the case, an evolutionary explanation would have to explain why
autism originated and spread in Europe over the last 20 to 40 thousand years. It is now
known, however, that autism affects all human populations (Szatmari and Goldberg, 2000).
In fact, autism presents with very similar prevalence rates, worldwide, in all studied races
and ethnic groups (Fombonne, 2002) and has only a very moderate association with
immigrant status or socioeconomic status (Morrier, Hess, and Heflin, 2008). That autism
has similar prevalence in all studied ethnic groups strongly suggests that it existed in a fully
developed form well before the first humans left Africa. Autism and the autism spectrum
appear to be very ancient, yet how were the responsible genes selected and maintained over
tens or perhaps hundreds of millennia?
This article will delineate the "solitary forager" hypothesis of autism which
proposes that some genes contributing to autism were selected and maintained because they
facilitated solitary subsistence. Population dispersion, band fission or dissolution,
estrangement, ostracism, and separation were probably infrequent but unavoidably
reoccurring conditions that may have impacted the human genome during evolution.
Individuals on the autism spectrum are described here as having had the potential to be
self-sufficient and capable foragers in scenarios marked by diminished social contact. In
other words, these individuals, unlike neurotypical humans, would not have been obligately
social and may have been predisposed toward taking up a relatively solitary lifestyle.
Common psychological characteristics of autism are taken here as a suite of cognitive
adaptations that would have facilitated lone foraging. Like other solitary mammals with
similar cognitive adaptations, they were probably not completely solitary; rather, they may
have done much of their foraging alone and reconvened intermittently with familiar
individuals. The article will use the perspectives from evolutionary medicine and
evolutionary psychopathology to expound upon this hypothesis in a conjectural and
exploratory manner. Corroborating evidence is sought from evolutionary medicine, the
systemizing theory of autism, anthropology, primatology and comparative neuroscience.
Autism and Evolutionary Medicine
The solitary forager hypothesis

Many medical conditions that are pathological in the present are known to have
been adaptive in the ancestral environment, and the science of evolutionary medicine is
concerned with identifying and understanding these conditions (Williams and Nesse, 1991).
It is thought that evolutionary perspectives on disease can elucidate pathophysiology and
ultimately inform treatment strategy (Gluckman et al., 2009). The accomplishments of
evolutionary medicine in explaining disease in terms of adaptation to environment are
extensive and have provided insights into the origins of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular
disease, cystic fibrosis, diabetes mellitus, obesity, sickle cell anemia and many others
(Trevathan, 2007). Evolutionary medicine has also attempted to explain the origins of
certain mental disorders. Several well-received theories have been formulated based on
these attempts and they may lend perspective to the natural history of autism.
The growing fields of evolutionary psychopathology (Nesse, 1999; Baron-Cohen,
1997), and evolutionary psychiatry (Brune, 2008; Panksepp, 2006) are concerned with the
application of evolutionary rationale to the understanding of psychological and psychiatric
disorders. Researchers in these domains have concluded that there were multiple,
alternative cognitive strategies used to deal with the problems and obstacles that recurred in
our evolutionary past (Cosmides and Tooby, 1992). Furthermore, they have emphasized
that individual differences in developmental patterns may not always represent the effects
of idiosyncratic life experiences, but in fact represent biological, naturally selected
responses to pressing environmental concerns (Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2000; Hood and
Jenkins, 2008).
A number of sensible evolutionary theories of autism have been put forth. Autism
has been conceptualized as a low-fitness extreme of a parentally-selected fitness indicator
(Shaner, Miller, and Mintz, 2008). The authors have advanced that variation in the ability
to connect socially to ones parents, an adaptive trait, may have a maladaptive, extreme
form that results in autism. Other researchers have envisioned autism as a consequence of
paternally imprinted genes (Badcock and Crespi, 2006). This idea has been taken further
and autistic-like traits have been envisioned as constituting a male-typical strategy geared
toward parental investment, low-mating effort, high partner-specific investment and long-
term resource allocation (Del Giudice, Angeleri, Brizio, and Elena, 2010). These and other
theories of autism are well-supported and plausible. None of these are directly compatible
with the present hypothesis but neither are they directly contradictory. Like the present
hypothesis they view autism as an extreme end of a continuum constituted by adaptive
traits. Unlike these though, the present hypothesis attempts to explain autism in terms of
the behavioral ecology of hunting and gathering.
Many articles in the last two decades have attempted to utilize the perspective of
behavioral ecology to explain various forms of psychopathology (e.g., anxiety, addictive
personality, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, psychopathy and post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD)). These articles have attempted to reconceptualize these disorders as
adaptive, cognitive syndromes that, at one time, had ecological utility (Hood and Jenkins,
2008; Reser, 2006). These articles have given thoughtful treatments to disorders such as:
anxiety, hypothesized to represent a careful, cautious strategy (Marks and Nesse, 1994);
depression, a socially submissive strategy (Allen and Badcock, 2006); schizophrenia, a
defensive, vigilant and impulsive strategy (Reser, 2007); psychopathy, a socially selfish
The solitary forager hypothesis
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 9(2). 2011. -211-
and opportunistic strategy (Brune and Brune-Cohrs, 2006); and PTSD, a threat-avoidant
strategy (Bracha and Maser, 2008). Significant comparative evidence supports these four
theories. The symptoms of anxiety, depression, psychopathy and PTSD have been shown to
exist in other animals, serving adaptive purposes. Imagine the plight of a guppy born
without the capacity for predator anxiety or a social monkey born without the instinct to act
subordinate to larger, dominant monkeys. Despite the cultural stigma and psychological
pain associated with these four disorders today, genetic susceptibility to them would have
conferred specific adaptive benefits in prehistoric times. Certainly, a person who meets the
criteria for an anxiety disorder takes this "cautious strategy" to an extreme; however,
researchers speculate that such people may have achieved high reproductive success during
highly volatile, violent or unpredictable times (Nesse, 2007). Similarly, self-subordination,
threat-avoidance and selfishness all represent important behavioral proclivities that have
strong neurological foundations in a large variety of species. Importantly, social and asocial
tendencies also have neurological bases and vary widely between species (Robinson,
Fernald and Clayton, 2008). Innate predispositions toward sociality are also thought to vary
within species (Brune and Brune-Cohrs, 2006), and it is thought that the severity of autism,
like the severity of these other disorders, can be shown to exist on a continuum. As a final
example of the success and applicability of evolutionary psychopathology to mental
disorder, let us consider the popular reconceptualization of attention-deficit / hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD).
Thom Hartmann (1997) coined the phrase "hunter in a farmer's world" to explain
the predicament of individuals with ADHD. He totally rethought the condition, explaining
that in the ancestral environment, children were not naturally selected to listen for hours on
end, to pay careful attention to lessons, or to concentrate for long periods on assignments.
Shapiro and others (Jensen et al., 1997) have elaborated on this hypothesis. They explained
that the predilection for individuals with ADHD to be impulsive, hyperactive and scattered
could have offered advantages in prehistoric times. It is likely that the ability to focus on a
single concept for a prolonged period was not necessarily beneficial in hunting and
gathering times. High levels of activity and scanning, though, may have kept humans in
tune with a rapidly changing environment and allowed them to identify and act on both
immediate threats and immediate opportunities. Additionally, Panksepp (1998) has
concluded that even some severe cases of ADHD may reflect normal variation in these
adaptive tendencies. Likewise, this article will take the perspective of evolutionary
psychopathology and make the argument that autism represents "a lone forager in a social
world." As with ADHD, perhaps a large proportion of the autism spectrum, maybe even
pronounced cases of autism, may reflect normal variation. The autism spectrum will be
conceptualized as representing naturally occurring variation, at one extreme end of the
sociality continuum.
Presentation of the Hypothesis
Today, the cognitive disabilities associated with the autism spectrum are clear and
well documented; however, modern social, occupational, and mating practices may conceal
the evolutionary or adaptive benefits. From an anthropological perspective, the society we
The solitary forager hypothesis

live in is very different from the ancestral environment. Because of the large group sizes
seen in modern day cities and the very social nature of modern employment, social abilities
such as congeniality, extraversion and savoir-faire are highly regarded. Even minimal
social dysfunction or awkwardness can be professionally and socially problematic. In fact,
the DSM considers social ability as a critical component of psychological health (APA,
1994). Social ability may have been less critical though in the prehistoric past, especially
within certain contexts. During the six million years since our branch diverged from that of
chimpanzees, our ancestors lived in relatively small groups that probably fluctuated greatly
in size (Nesse and Williams, 1995). Under these conditions, the abilities to relate
effortlessly to a stranger, to display affection in a demonstrative manner, or to charm a
foraging companion were probably exposed to inconsistent selective pressures.
Inconsistencies in the level of social ability that our environment demanded may well be
responsible for the large variation in social abilities seen in human populations, as well as
the extremes of social "dysfunction."
The adaptive value of social ability may have been inconsistent in the ancestral past
for many reasons. Depending on the period of human evolution, the geographical location,
the ecological setting and the cultural habits of the group in question, ancestral foragers
may have foraged intimately with others throughout the day, may have spent weeks
foraging alone, or anything between these two extremes. Humans are a highly social
species, and this tells us that, like chimpanzees, we must have spent much of our formative
years congregating together (Byrne and Bates, 2007). However, just as our social
tendencies are a testament to our social past, our asocial tendencies may indicate the
opposite. In other words, during prehistoric times, a certain proportion of breeding
individuals may have adapted neurologically to living under conditions where group size
was very small or social contact was attenuated, and this may have led to the numerous
autism genes found in the modern-day gene pool. It is unclear which phenotypes on the
autism spectrum might have been selected for in the ancestral environment. Surely it is
most conservative and parsimonious though to assume that high-functioning or subclinical
phenotypes were the substrate for selection.
Certain eccentricities or impediments peculiar to autism may have precluded past
researchers from considering that individuals on the autism spectrum may have survived
well during prehistoric times. As in neurotypical individuals, behavior in autism can vary
markedly from individual to individual. Some individuals with autism are awkward and
unwieldy while others are graceful and nimble. Some are gentle and kind while others can
become angry and violent. Some are severely mentally handicapped whereas others are
cognitively gifted. These extremes, often barely tempered by social constraints and morays,
might make these individuals appear dangerously unnatural. Given this, and given that a
proportion of individuals with autism cannot be mainstreamed comfortably in elementary
school, it may appear that autism would have been maladaptive. Hypothetically though, it
would be much more difficult to place a young orangutan in a human elementary school
classroom than it would be to place the average autistic child, and yet orangutans are
capable of reaching full ecological independence before age 10 (Wich, Atmoko, and Setia,
2009). Although, some individuals on the autism spectrum have grave social deficits, many
may have been able to survive and prosper as effectively as other solitary mammals in their

natural environment. A great deal of new research supports this line of reasoning by
illustrating that autistic individuals may have great trouble with social cognition but that
their other cognitive abilities are largely intact (Baron-Cohen, 2003). The next section will
consider some of the findings in the literature on autistic intelligence, supporting the notion
that autistic individuals can be very competent in areas that do not require social cognition.
Testing the Hypothesis
Autistic intelligence and systemizing
Simon Baron-Cohen and others have changed the way that many researchers think
about autism by pointing out that a social deficit alone may account for most of the
symptoms. Previous theories of autism have characterized autistics as cognitively confused,
disorganized or incoherent. Baron-Cohen, on the other hand, has characterized autistics as
having profound social disabilities but otherwise being coherent and able-minded. His
theories of autism emphasize that the main deficit is in the social domain, specifically, in
the inability to empathize with and model the minds of others (Baron-Cohen, 1995). A
large number of subsequent studies have substantiated that "theory of mind," or the ability
to empathize with others, is impaired in autism (Colle, Baron-Cohen, and Hill, 2007).
Baron-Cohen and others have argued persuasively that impaired theory of mind in autism
can be independent of learning ability and general intelligence. Furthermore, he has
documented that some autistic individuals can have superior technical understanding of
physical systems (sometimes referred to as folk physics as opposed to folk psychology)
compared to their age-matched peers, and he has termed this ability "systemizing."
Baron-Cohen has demonstrated that even though autistics are poor at empathizing,
they are good at systemizing. Systemizing is the ability to observe a physical system and
make inferences or conclusions about how it works and what causes it to work the way it
does. He explains that systemizing works well for phenomena that are lawful and
deterministic but that systemizing is of almost no use when it comes to predicting moment-
by-moment changes in a person's behavior. Empathizing and forming theories about the
other person's mind is required for the latter task (Baron-Cohen, Ashwin, Ashwin,
Tavassoli, and Chakrabarti, 2009). According to Baron-Cohen, abilities that are associated
with empathizing include responding empathetically to distress, intuiting another's
emotional state, being sensitive to facial expressions, and demonstrating ability with
language. Systemizing, on the other hand, is associated with ability in domains such as map
reading, mental rotation, physics, mathematics and motoric systems (Baron-Cohen, 1995).
People who are good at empathizing are thought to lean toward jobs in the areas of social
work, psychology, and nursing. High systemizing is thought to lead to jobs in engineering,
construction, and science. Baron-Cohen has even indicated that he thinks that autistic traits
may have been naturally selected due to their contribution to tool construction and use
(Baron-Cohen, 2003).
Unlike autism, empathizing seems to be unimpaired in individuals with Down
syndrome, William's syndrome, and some other forms of mental retardation, despite their
decreased ability to systemize and their lower general intelligence (Baron-Cohen, Leslie,
and Frith, 1986; Karmiloff-Smith, Grant, Bellugi, and Baron-Cohen, 1995). This
The solitary forager hypothesis
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 9(2). 2011. -214-
dissociation between intelligence and empathy indicates a real genetic and cognitive
difference between the two types of disorders. Many children with autism have IQs well
below the average for their age; however, the intelligence tests that correct for social
disability have shown that many autistics may in fact not be intellectually impaired at all
(Scheuffgen, Happe, Anderson, and Frith, 2000). Contrary to speculations, researchers have
found little evidence of a deficit of executive function in autistic children younger than 4
years of age. This suggests that the mild executive function deficits seen after age 4 are not
primary to the disorder but may arise later because of the absence of social learning
(Griffith, Pennington, Wehner, and Rogers, 1999). In fact, several "less learned, more
innate" executive functions, including inhibition and visual working memory, appear to be
spared in autism (Russell, 1997).
Baron-Cohen, and those who have followed him, has performed a great deal of
research showing that systemizing is part of the genetic profile of autism and that the
autistic spectrum is continuous with normal human variation. He has demonstrated that the
parents and relatives of people with autism are good at systemizing but not very good at
empathizing. He has compiled data showing that fathers and grandfathers of males with
autism are twice as likely to be engineers compared to males in the general population
(Baron-Cohen, 2006). He has also shown that students in the natural sciences have a higher
number of relatives with autism than do students in the humanities (Baron-Cohen, 2006).
Baron-Cohen and others have also shown that in Asperger's syndrome and in high-
functioning autism, individuals can perform at normal or often superior levels in tasks
requiring the systemization of information. People with Asperger's scored higher on his
Systemizing Quotient (SQ) (Baron-Cohen, Richler, Bisarya, Gurunathan, and Wheelwright,
2003), performed better on tests of intuitive physics (Lawson, Baron-Cohen, and
Wheelwright, 2004) and can reach extremely high levels of achievement in systemizing
domains, such as mathematics, physics, and computer science (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright,
Stone, and Rutherford, 1999). This has been called the "autism advantage" in popular
autism advocacy. It is thought that these high-functioning autistic individuals may be
neurologically well-suited for certain jobs that are detail-oriented, repetitive, and involve
the identification of technical errors (Scheuffgen et al., 2000). A popular conceptualization
of this purports the idea that quirky computer specialists working in Silicon Valley, for
example, desire jobs allowing them to work alone on computing problems, tend to marry
others who are high on systemizing but low on empathy, and tend to have a propensity to
have children that, like them, are on the autism spectrum. Baron-Cohen pointed out that, "If
systemizing talent is genetic, such genes appear to co-segregate with genes for autism
(Baron-Cohen, 2006, p. 868)."
Baron-Cohen has extended his theories into the "extreme male brain theory" of
autism (Baron-Cohen, 2003). He pointed out that women, when compared to men, are more
verbal, more socially adept, and have more sophisticated capacities for empathy and theory
of mind. He asserted that the differences between non-autistics and autistics could be
thought of as analogous to the differences between women and men. This extreme male
brain theory is fascinating, well-supported, and may produce testable hypotheses. Baron-
Cohen's analogies may be expanded if one concludes that autism represents the cognitive
style of an individual who is well-suited for living alone. Comparing non-autistic and
The solitary forager hypothesis

autistic individuals then may be more like comparing a dog (a pack animal) to a cat (a
largely solitary animal) rather than comparing a woman to a man.
Baron-Cohen and others have been successful in convincing many researchers that
autistic people are intelligent in a different way and very good at systemizing and
understanding non-social, natural processes. Baron-Cohen has even posited that evolution
may have maintained the genes for autism precisely because of the systemizing ability,
suggesting also that many cases of autism may be due to the assortative mating of two
high-systemizing parents (Baron-Cohen, 2006). The present paper hopes to extend these
arguments by pointing out that these natural systemizing abilities could have predisposed
people on the autism spectrum to be able-minded, able-bodied, solitary foragers in the
prehistoric past.
Autistic intelligence and foraging
In modern society, due to cultural, historic, and sociological circumstances, many
individuals with autism do not learn to become self-sufficient. Due to their social deficits,
many people with autism do not follow their peers on a path toward social and occupational
mobility. Today, children must go through a prolonged period of education and
socialization to reach a point where they can hold a job and live autonomously. Autonomy
and even food procurement depend on social abilities as well as learning that took place in
a particularly social setting, the school classroom. Schooling can be very difficult for
individuals with autism because, as the systemizing theory of autism has demonstrated,
individuals with autism have a proclivity to learn things on their own rather than from
others (Siegel, 2003). Unfortunately, the interests chosen and knowledge acquired by
individuals with autism often do not coincide with financial, professional, or social
opportunities (Cimera and Cowan, 2009). Even when carefully guided by loving parents, it
is difficult for many individuals with autism to teach themselves how to become self-
sufficient in today's world. However, this may have been much more natural in the
ancestral environment, particularly considering that merely 10,000 years ago, neither food
procurement nor the acquisition of a place to sleep were necessarily contingent on social
ability as they are today. The discipline of behavioral ecology, which may be applicable
here, is based on the premise that behavioral traits, and the neural substrates responsible for
them, are shaped by natural selection and hence are fine-tuned to respond to a particular
environment (Krebs and Davies, 1993). The autism spectrum may be explicable in terms of
behavioral ecology in the sense that it represents the adaptive value of being fine-tuned to
thrive in an environment with diminished social contact.
Similar to mothers in contemporary foraging societies, mothers in the ancestral past
would have required their children to learn how to forage for food from an early age (Buss,
2005). Virtually all mammals, whether of social or asocial species, use their systemizing
abilities to learn food procurement techniques from their mothers (Krebs and Davies,
1993). The offspring of asocial mammalian species may not be motivated to empathize or
socialize much with their mother, but are nonetheless driven by hunger to attend to her
examples and internalize her tactics (Begon, Townsend, and Harper, 1996). This strategy
works well for hundreds of species of asocial mammals (even ones with very small brains
and limited systemizing abilities) and presumably would have worked well for individuals
The solitary forager hypothesis

with autism. Of course, it would be an immoral experiment to place an autistic toddler and
its mother in the wilderness for years in order to see if he or she learns and thrives.
However, would such an experiment be needed if it could be shown that autistic behaviors
are normal relative to those of other solitary animals taken out of the wild since birth (e.g.,
a pet reptile, a domestic cat, or a captive orangutan)? Are there reasons to think that an
individual with autism, living in prehistoric times, would not be strongly motivated by
thirst, appetite, discomfort, sexual urges, and other innate instincts to become nutritionally
independent and to increase its reproductive success?
The behavior of autistic individuals is often seen as bewilderingly inappropriate in a
social context, because they so often become interested in or obsessed with socially
meaningless activities (Piven, 2000). In a natural environment though, it is likely that
hunger would have motivated them to redirect their obsessive tendencies toward food
procurement. Today, their hunger for food does not drive them to refine food procurement
techniques because their parents feed them every time they are hungry. Modern humans are
responsible for social and academic learning and are rarely given the chance to be
positively reinforced by successful food acquisition. This temporal or causal pairing
between learning and satiety, integral for wild animals (Domjan, 2003), has been
artificially taken away from modern children. Because the compelling and coercing natural
instinct of hunger does not actuate or motivate modern individuals with autism, their efforts
and skills are misplaced onto irrelevant stimuli.
The powerful and mobilizing asocial fascinations and preoccupations seen in
modern-day autism could have aided their prehistoric counterparts in self-preservation.
Humans habituate to things that they are not interested in and systemize things that they
find rewarding, motivating, or intrinsically interesting. In the ancestral past, activities
leading up to the sating of hunger would have been highly reinforced, and thus food
procurement and food processing strategies would have been the primary variables of the
reinforcement schedule for individuals with autism. Perhaps, when children with autism
ignore their parent's examples of social behavior today, it is because these examples seem
uninteresting and meaningless, whereas in the ancestral past they would have been inspired
by their parent's hunting and gathering activities. Today, because they are not able to
forage or to watch their parents forage and because they can obtain food free of effort, their
interests are redirected toward salient, nonsocial activities, like stacking blocks, flipping
light switches, lining toys up in rows, playing with running water, chasing vacuum
cleaners, and collecting bottle tops. This kind of misapplication of an innate tendency is
known in human ethology as a type of "vacuum activity" (Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 2009, p. 153).
The interests of autistic individuals often lead to the development of islets of
aptitude or competence. Despite obvious deficits, many exhibit that they have refined or
even mastered certain skills. These skills are often referred to as splinter skills. These may
include eccentric proficiencies, such as penchants for drawing, music, rote-memory, or
puzzle solving (Treffert, 2009). In extreme cases, these skills might include what are often
called savant abilities including things like counting, hyperlexia, pattern finding, and
calendar or mathematical calculation (Treffert, 2000). Some of these skills and abilities in
autism were probably acquired because the individual focused on a particular type of
problem solving, they learned to systemize a particular system, and then they retained and

elaborated on the ability. In the past, these elaborate abilities would probably have mapped
onto the acquisition of foraging techniques, which, would have been honed to proficiency
through rote repetition and practice.
Many anthropologists studying hunter-gatherer groups exclaim that the foragers that
they are observing have cultivated amazing naturalistic abilities and are able to sense and
perceive things to which they themselves are virtually blind (Kaplan, Hill, Lancaster, and
Hurtado, 2000). These abilities, like tracking, ranging, stalking, food processing, mapping
of terrain, and knowledge of flora and fauna may be areas through which the potential for
autistic or savant-like abilities were channeled in the ancestral past. The same could be said
for the deep stores of specialized or technical knowledge exhibited by people on the autism
spectrum. This penchant for knowledge about pet interests could have been dedicated to
memorizing edible and inedible species, analyzing the habits of prey items, understanding
self-protection, maximization of food-collection efficiency, tool fashioning, and shelter
procurement.
Aside from their asocial preoccupations, individuals with autism also exhibit
stereotyped and repetitive actions (Piven, 2000). In fact, many mammals engage in
perseverative or repetitious behaviors especially when placed into unnatural or confining
environments (Lewis, Tanimura, Lee, and Bodfish, 2007). Repetitive, stereotypical
behavior (including self-injurious behavior) is very rare in the wild but very common in
captive animals, as well as in autism (Grandin, 2009). More intelligent animals seem to
have increased capacity for self-injurious behaviors. It has been estimated that 10 to 15
percent of rhesus monkeys living alone in a cage develop self-biting, head banging and
self-slapping (Lewis et al., 2007). This may indicate that the living conditions that many
young individuals with autism experience are artificial, and possibly inhumane, as they are
not as stimulating or motivating as the wild environment that they are born expecting.
The propensity toward strict adherence to routine seen in autism may have close
analogues in the "master routines" and "subroutines" of many non-social species (e.g.,
waking, cautious emergence, defecation, grooming, basking, foraging, returning, bedding,
sleeping). Although such neurologically mediated rituals can be repetitive and inflexible at
times in many vertebrate species, they are important regulators of adaptive behavior
(MacLean, 1990). Perhaps the persistent, stereotyped behaviors characteristic of autism had
ecological utility in the sense that they allowed structure, order, and self-regulation. Why is
there the tendency toward tedium and invariability then? Most of the variety in the life of a
human hunter-gatherer is probably found in its social interactions. There would probably be
much less variety in the life of a lone hunter-gatherer. A lone forager would be forced to
engage in lonely, repetitive, and stereotypic activities, such as scanning repeatedly for
threats and items to scavenge, picking and processing fruit, searching for and extracting
vegetables, and locating and capturing prey items. An obsessive desire for sameness,
repetition, and ritual makes little sense in the context of a social setting but seems
applicable in a lone setting. In fact, it might be bad to expect variability and to thrive off
unpredictability in a solitary scenario because of the monotony of living alone.
A mind that is highly geared toward using social cognition and forming emotional
relationships would have been disadvantageous in an individual who was forced by
circumstance to live in a solitary scenario. This may help explain why many individuals
The solitary forager hypothesis
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 9(2). 2011. -218-
with autism have an undue preference for their own company, pay attention to the non-
social aspects of people, and treat others as if they were inanimate objects (Bowler, 2007).
Concentrating on empathy or theory of mind would probably have been impractical and
counterproductive. Brune and Brune-Cohrs (2006) have speculated that theory of mind and
social cognition are probably vulnerable to dysfunction. He pointed out that most people at
one time or another have strong desires to ascribe intentions to non-animals. A solitary
forager without autism may be likely to attribute agency or ascribe intentions to inanimate
objects, amounting to displaced and confused behavior.
In her book "Animals Make Us Human" autistic professor Temple Grandin (who
herself engaged in repetitive, restricted and self-injurious behavior at a young age) points
out that even though domestic dogs and cats both live comfortably with humans, only cats
can leave a human family to live solitarily in the wild (Grandin, 2009). "If you put the
family poodle out in the countryside, his chances of surviving are low unless he finds
another family to live with. But abandoned cats do fine" (p. 70). Here she underscores the
fact that some animals are obligately social whereas others can transition between social
and solitary lifestyles. Her life story is an attestation to the fact that individuals with severe
autism can make this transition while maintaining the "cognitive coherency" to contribute
profoundly to both industry and academia (Grandin, 1996).
Like other animals that are not obligately social, many individuals with autism
avoid close bodily contact and fail to establish emotional relationships. It seems that these
tendencies might have facilitated solitary life, whereas the inclinations to seek out physical
contact and emotional relationships could have made solitary life miserable or unbearable.
Classic works of fiction portraying humans abandoned or marooned from others emphasize
the human need for companionship. The protagonists in such works frequently have
unremitting obsessions with imaginary friends, behavior that would be extraneous and
probably maladaptive for a solitary human. People on the autism spectrum would be less
likely to yearn for companionship and more likely to focus on survival. Solitary species
have very limited abilities for social cognition. This is probably because gregarious
predispositions, companionable inclinations, and social instincts in general are maladaptive
in a solitary context.
Autistics and orangutans: Solitary foragers
An analysis of the behavior of orangutans in the wild offers valuable insight into the
ecology of a solitary ape. Most animals, many mammals, and several species of primates
seek out food on their own. It is clear that such a solitary foraging strategy can even be
effective for apes. In fact, orangutans, the species that is genetically third closest to humans
as revealed by molecular studies, live solitarily in the wild. Orangutans eat, sleep, hunt, and
forage on their own (Delgado and Van Schaik, 2000). They are often described as cautious
and introverted, and it has been estimated that Bornean orangutans spend at least 95% of
their time alone (Van Schaik, 1999). Orangutans have low interaction and association rates,
and only infrequently meet up with conspecifics, often only to mate (Van Schaik and Van
Hoof, 1996). They have been reported to congregate in small groups temporarily, but only
to eat from a particularly fruit-laden tree. Several specialists emphasize that orangutans
have limited social aptitude and tend to prefer solitude (Van Schaik, 1999). Van Schaik
The solitary forager hypothesis
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 9(2). 2011. -219-
(1999) has concluded that, unlike all other species of apes, well-defined communities do
not appear to exist in any orangutan population studied so far.
In orangutans, inculcation in infancy and juvenility consists of learning about food
procurement from the mother. In stark contrast, chimpanzees are indoctrinated into learning
about both food procurement and socialization (Delgado and Van Schaik, 2000). Orangutan
mothers teach their babies to recognize edible food species, implement foraging techniques,
find shelter from the elements, protect themselves from predators, and develop effective
ranging capabilities (Noordwijk and Van Schaik, 2005). Compared to chimpanzees, young
orangutans do not learn much from their mothers about communication or socialization;
however, they do learn everything that they need to survive and reproduce.
Unlike their orangutan counterparts, chimpanzee adolescents reliably stay with (or
at least frequently visit) their mothers for months or years after they have been weaned
(Goodall, 1986). Their strong affective ties, emotional attachments, and gregarious nature
keep mother and child in contact into adulthood or, at times, throughout life (Galdikas,
1984). Orangutans, on the other hand, exhibit very different behavior. Adolescent
orangutans reliably leave their mother and go off on their own to forage very soon after
weaning. The bond between the mother and child is based largely on the provision of milk
(Noordwijk and Van Schaik, 2005). One of the most frequent complaints of parents with
autistic children is that they find it very difficult to build an emotional bond with the child
(Frith, 1991). One might imagine that in an ancestral setting the bond between a mother
and her autistic child could have been as delicate (and yet at times, as ecologically
appropriate) as the bond seen in orangutans. Despite this relative delicacy, the vast majority
of babies and children with autism do develop true psychological attachments to their
caregivers. This attachment would probably have facilitated the acquisition of foraging
techniques as it does in orangutans.
The ability to make inferences about the mental states of others probably first
emerged in a clear form during early primate evolution due to heavy selection from the
social environment (Brothers, 1990). Apes, relative to monkeys though, have elaborated
greatly upon this ability, presumably because their social environment was even more
important. Aside from orangutans, all apes, including gibbons, gorillas, chimpanzees, and
bonobos are social species, much like humans (Chance and Jolly, 1970). To some degree, it
seems that orangutans regressed in their social abilities relative to other apes because, as
their group size decreased, pressure from the social environment must have decreased
along with it.
Primatologists generally agree that orangutans live solitary lifestyles primarily
because the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, where they are found, have poor food density.
Relative to the lush African regions that chimpanzees and gorillas inhabit, these islands
cannot support large groups of social apes (Delgado and Van Schaik, 2000). If orangutans
lived in larger social groups, they would have to travel extremely far (up to 20 miles) each
day simply to get enough food to sustain themselves (Sugardijto, te Boekhorst, and van
Hoof, 1987). Because orangutans are large animals, and because the trees and bushes in
their non-seasonal habitat go through various phases of producing buds, shoots, and fruit,
the orangutans must forage through many plants daily to ferret out the right dietary
foodstuffs (Delgado and van Schaik, 2000). Because they must traverse so much land
The solitary forager hypothesis
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 9(2). 2011. -220-
everyday in order to obtain a sufficient number of calories, individual orangutans must
define large territories for themselves. It is thought that in Sumatra, each orangutan needs
nearly a square kilometer and that in Borneo each requires an even larger area of spatial
isolation (MacKinnon, 1974). Fascinatingly, Borneo is thought to be less food-dense, and
Bornean orangutans are thought to be less socially inclined when compared to Sumatran
orangutans (Van Schaik, 1999). Food density of the habitat is actually known to be an
important determinant of group size in a number of animals (Marler, 1968). In fact, when
food becomes scarce, even chimpanzees split up to search for food alone (de Waal, 1982).
Harsh and unpredictable climates marked much of the period of human evolution
(Reed, 1997). The Pleistocene and Pliocene ice ages caused frequent aridity of the African
plains, which would have dried up many sources of food for our foraging ancestors
(Ravelo, Andreasen, Lyle, Lyle, and Wara, 2004). These conditions would have rendered
our habitat nutritionally scarce (Bobe, Behrensmeyer, and Chapman, 2002), perhaps
forcing groups of our ancestors to disband. Humans may have been forced to do this
habitually in the past despite the fact that we are an inherently social species. In sum,
environmental forces prominent during our evolution caused nutritional scarcity that, at
least in some geographic regions, may have created the same conditions that selected
orangutans to become solitary. Another condition that influences selection for sociality is
the distribution of food resources. It is known that when food is approximately evenly
dispersed in an environment, solitary foraging yields higher energy returns, but when food
is clumped, group foraging becomes more efficient (Marler, 1968). One may not even need
to invoke scarcity or food distribution patterns to conclude that many pre-social species,
including humans, may have experienced historical disruptions (either punctuated or
gradualistic) in their social continuity that left lasting traces in the genome.
Adaptations particular to orangutans, which are thought to reflect their life-history
strategies, may have implications for autism. Orangutans exhibit prominent sexual
dimorphism (van Schaik, 2004), and much of this is thought to be due to high testosterone
levels in the males. Autistics are also thought to exhibit elevated testosterone levels, which
may be associated with increased fetal exposure to testosterone (Knickmeyer, Baron-
Cohen, Raggatt, and Taylor, 2005). It might make sense that a solitary strategy is better
suited to males given that female animals of many species have an increased need for social
support and parenting proficiency. Male orangutans actually spend a greater proportion of
their time alone compared to females (most of the time spent between two males is thought
to be attributable to random, unintended encounters) (van Schaik, 1999). Interestingly,
autism is four times more prevalent in men compared to women, is accompanied by more
severe anomalies in brain structure in men, and is known to have a worse prognosis in men
(Bowler, 2007). Higher testosterone levels in autistic males may have increased their sexual
aggressiveness as well as their sexual attractiveness. Mating practices of individuals on the
autism spectrum may have been similar to those of the orangutan. Females with autism or
on the autistic spectrum probably had little difficulty in procuring receptive sex partners.
Males, on the other hand, could have procured partners using the same tactics used by male
orangutans, such as propositioning, perseverative soliciting, provisioning, food sharing, and
others.
It has not yet been made clear how much orangutan neurology has been affected by
The solitary forager hypothesis
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 9(2). 2011. -221-
their recent stint of solitary foraging, which may have only gone on for the last 10,000
years (Van Schaik, 1999). Regardless, evolutionary comparisons with solitary primates and
other solitary mammals that are known to have neurological adaptations causing them to
lack biological instincts for gregariousness, affection, and strong social relationships should
be informative. It is also important to affirm that no offense is intended toward autistic
individuals in this comparison with orangutans. Only traits related to sociality are
compared here, and individuals with autism are not in any way equated with apes in
general. In fact, individuals with autism are only compared to orangutans here to the same
extent that neurotypical individuals are compared to chimpanzees. Orangutans were
selected as a basis of comparison for this article simply because they are the species of
solitary foragers that is most closely related to humans.
The evolution of autism
The evolution of social tendencies in animals is a poorly understood topic of
research. Even less understood is the evolution of solitary tendencies from social forebears.
It is clear that there are costs and benefits to living in groups and that the pressures from the
social environment can change abruptly (Perez-Barberia, Shultz, and Dunbar, 2007).
Surely, in the past, individuals on the autism spectrum were sometimes born into the arms
of supportive and cohesive social groups, much like today. If autism does represent a
solitary forager strategy, then this circumstance could have constituted a mismatch that
may have been negatively selected against. However, most adaptations have risks
associated with them and instead of representing a panacea; they reflect tradeoffs that, over
evolutionary time, produce on average more benefits than costs. This mismatch may not
even have decreased fitness. Given the propensities of modern day people with autism,
such individuals might have chosen to journey off alone nomadically or hermitically.
Alternatively, they might have chosen to forage alone but return to their group infrequently
in order to interact and travel with group members. This may have depended on "how
autistic" the individual was. Even individuals on the far side of the autism spectrum may
not have even been truly solitary during prehistory. Social chess abilities or Machiavellian
intelligence are not well developed in people on the autism spectrum. Their speech and
mannerisms can be monotonous and mechanical, yet this may not have kept them from
offering valuable skills and forming functional relationships with other humans. In many
cases, autistic individuals exhibit pragmatic competence that could have made them
valuable attributes to their foraging companions. Today, a large proportion of individuals
with Asperger's have been assimilated into elite social and professional spheres despite the
fact that they are not adroit social conformers (Grandin, Duffy, and Attwood, 2008). It is
reasonable to imagine that a proficient hunter with autism could be not only tolerated but
highly valued by a small band of hunters who were each eccentric themselves, not having
been exposed to our modern, relatively conformist, post-industrial society. This would be
akin to the situation today where millions of mainstreamed autistic children around the
world have become accepted on the playground, despite their differences. It is well
accepted that despite valuing their time alone, many individuals with autism enjoy
friendships and have a documented predilection for valuing quality of friends over quantity
(Bauminger et al., 2008). Similarly, when in captivity, or when gathering around a large,
The solitary forager hypothesis
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 9(2). 2011. -222-
fertile fruit tree, orangutans can be observed to have social competencies, even if they are
not as facile or effusive as chimpanzees.
If autism in fact evolved, did it do so predominantly among neurotypical humans or
within an isolated population of solitary individuals? The autism continuum could represent
a remnant of genetic introgression that took place before humans were the lone species in
our genus. Perhaps some of the genes for autism evolved not in our direct ancestral line but
in a solitary subspecies which later merged genetically with our line of descent through
gene flow. Demes, or subpopulations of relatively solitary individuals, could have been
assimilated into our gene pool after a fair amount of interbreeding following migration.
Such solitary subpopulations could have arisen in ecologically or climatologically different
geographic regions of Africa anytime during the Plio-Pliestocene.
The evolution of human populations with short stature may shed light on this issue.
The pygmy phenotype, characterized by small body size, appears to have evolved
independently in South American, African, and Southeast Asian populations in the last
200,000 years. The phenotype is mostly restricted to rainforest environments and is thought
to represent a response to the selective pressures associated with living in a tropical
rainforest (Migliano, Vinicius, and Lahr, 2007). This powerful climatological association
has motivated adaptationist hypotheses as to how small size would increase reproductive
success in a warm, wet environment with dense foliage. Physical anthropologists have
hypothesized that short stature may have increased the capacity to cope with one or more of
the following: caloric limitations, high temperature, high humidity, extensive forest
undergrowth, increased mortality, vitamin deficiencies or even a combination of these
(Migliano et al., 2007). Multiple genetic disruptions of the growth hormone and insulin-like
growth factor I pathway are likely to be involved etiologically, but no specific DNA
mutations have been uncovered (Cavalli-Sforza, 1986). It is clear though that when
pygmies intermarry with non-pygmies, the result is a spectrum; children tend to be
intermediate in stature to those of the two parental populations (Cavalli-Sforza, 1986).
Pygmy populations show us a few things that are interesting in the present context: 1.
isolated pockets of humans can remain reproductively insulated for long enough to evolve
discrepant ecological strategies; 2. such populations can quickly (less than 40,000 years in
the South American and Asian pygmies; Cavalli-Sforza, 1986) develop features that vary
markedly from the norm; 3. these traits can involve multiple genes at different loci; and 4.
interbreeding can result in either continuous or polymorphic variation in subsequent
generations. It is interesting to note that, as these indigenous people become assimilated
into other gene pools, the genes for short stature will persist and may affect phenotypic
variability in sporadic and unpredictable ways for a long time to come.
The genes that make up a polygenic trait usually all have different natural histories.
They appeared as mutations at different periods, and they were selected at different times.
For example, several different genes, each working through different molecular
mechanisms, helped Europeans develop lighter skin as they moved to higher latitudes over
the last 60,000 years. Interestingly, an entirely different set of alleles with unique cellular
properties helped people in northern Asia develop lighter skin (Norton et al., 2007). Few of
these genes have been selected to fixation, and they occur together in different proportions,
creating a lot of variability in skin color even within isolated populations. The genes for
The solitary forager hypothesis
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 9(2). 2011. -223-
autism may be similar to these examples in the sense that each gene may have a different
natural history. Some genes may have been meant to work cooperatively whereas other
have not. Each gene that predisposes toward autism may represent a different way to make
an organism a little less reliant on sociality.
Like other polygenic, continuous traits, the mutations responsible for autism could
have been maintained by "environmental heterogeneity," a form of balancing selection. In
other words, the genes responsible for autism may have remained in our gene pool because
as social-environmental conditions fluctuated in the past, discrepant genetic
polymorphisms, or "multiple alternate alleles," were favored. Currently, it is not possible to
scrutinize the natural history of autism genes at this level of analysis because, even though
over a dozen genes have been implicated, including an oxytocin receptor, a serotonin
transporter, and putative language genes, very little agreement exists in the literature over
the specifics (Cantor, 2009).
It is currently not possible to tell whether the frequencies of genetic variants
responsible for autism are high enough, or in the right proportions, to accommodate a
model of past positive selection. The contributions of a large number of relatively rare
genes and of de novo mutations (Abrahams and Geschwind, 2008) tell us that autism may
not have been subject to natural selection for thousands of years and that it may have a
large non-evolutionary component, as well as an irregular evolutionary signature. The
present article cannot fully address this issue primarily because of the lack of knowledge
about the genetics of autism. It is unclear whether autism can be explained better by rare
mutations or by rare combinations of common genetic variants (Muhle, Trentacoste, and
Rapin, 2004). Future linkage and association studies though may be able to resolve whether
the responsible genes are mutated sequences encoding aberrant gene products or normal
polymorphisms acting synergistically (Kumar and Christian, 2009). It is also clear that a
certain proportion of the clinical picture of autism is not representative of adaptation. Some
cases of autism are associated with congenital anomalies and physical stigmata that were
probably not adaptive. How and why rare comorbidities such as Rett syndrome, tuberous
sclerosis, fragile X syndrome, psychomotor epilepsy, and other clinical entities can present
with autism is far from apparent (Amaral et al., 2008). It may be the case that several
pathological conditions present symptoms that resemble autism (or exacerbate autism) and
thus clinicians and epidemiologists have grouped them together with autism, obscuring its
natural visage and the elements of it that could have been adaptive. This is certainly the
case with ADHD and schizophrenia. Idiopathic or teratogenic neurodevelopmental insults
can closely mimic these as well as other neurodevelopmental disorders (Zimmerman,
2008). Many of these unknowns will not become clear until additional genetic, molecular,
and pathophysiological research is done.
Another important criticism of the present argument is that there may be no clearly
documented anthropological evidence for solitary foraging in modern humans. This
shouldn't be taken as significant evidence against the present hypothesis given that there do
not seem to be any documented examples of autistic individuals in hunter-gatherer groups
either. It seems that no one has looked for these things systematically. The prevalence of
autism in forager groups should be equivalent to the prevalence in the rest of the world,
given that epidemiologic studies indicate that environmental factors, such as perinatal
The solitary forager hypothesis
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 9(2). 2011. -224-
insults, prenatal infections, teratogens, and toxins (factors that may be particular to modern
life) account for only very few cases of autism (Amaral et al., 2008). In modern society, it
is apparent many people intentionally sequester themselves or prefer solitude to different
degrees, and it is reasonable to expect that this type of behavior would have existed in the
ancestral past and could have been continuous with the autism spectrum. Despite the fact
that there seems to be no academic literature on solitary foraging in humans it is clear that
when food is scarce, hunting parties have been seen to disperse for solitary hunting and
reconvene at later times (Hill and Kaplan, 1993; Jochim, 1988). When food is not abundant
and nutritional intake is low, the optimal foraging strategy is to lower population size and
density (Belovsky, 1988). As with other apes, submarginal or impoverished habitats cannot
support large groups of humans, and group size diminishes under these circumstances
(Mandryk, 1993).
Several substantiated cases of abandoned youths, known as feral children, have
survived to adulthood in the wild (Brothers, 1990). It is probable that a much larger
proportion of children were orphaned in the wilderness in ancestral times, and this may
have contributed to the selective pressures for asocial temperament. Feral children usually
have many autistic features in the sense that they are emotionally detached, prefer solitude,
and eschew physical contact (Brothers, 1990). These features may constitute protective,
adaptive responses to solitary life, and their resemblance to the symptoms of autism may
not be coincidental.
A consistent, predictable proportion of ancestral humans (and ancestral hominins)
must have been forced to live alone during the six million years of human prehistory. From
these individuals, the ones with mutations that created disruptive abnormalities in regions
of the social brain may have experienced increased reproductive success. This should not
sound like a stretch, considering that this general pattern may have already occurred during
the evolution of orangutans. After orangutans diverged from the common ancestor that they
shared with gibbons around 18 million years ago, they moved into Southeast Asian
rainforests where they were forced to give up their social lives for solitary ones because of
ecological constraints (Sugardjito et al., 1987). It appears that from the consistency of their
behavior in and out of the wild, their solitary tendencies may be hereditary and
neurological. For this reason, it should be very informative for autism researchers to
compare the brain areas responsible for social cognition across apes. This kind of research
has not yet been done. We may never know exactly what it was like to have autism in
prehistoric times, but comparing them to known solitary species on a variety of
neurological measures may provide clarification.
The brain in autism
The brain abnormalities in autism do not seem to constitute indiscriminate
pathological abnormalities as one might expect if autism were simply a disease. The most
conspicuous brain abnormalities seem to consistently and systematically affect the areas of
the brain that have been associated with social cognition (Adolfs, 2001). The amygdala, the
anterior cingulate cortex, the orbito and medial frontal cortex, and the mirror neuron system
have all been strongly associated with social cognition (Dapretto, Davies, and Pfeifer,
2006), and also have been shown to be the same areas that exhibit the prominent anomalies
The solitary forager hypothesis
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 9(2). 2011. -225-
in autism (Williams, Whiten, Suddendorf, and Perrett, 2001). This selectivity makes it
seem that the genes that influence social areas of the brain were affected and the others
were spared (consonant with Baron-Cohen's psychological theories of autism). According
to Gelman and Williams (1998), brains have been evolutionarily organized to acquire and
store particular sorts of relevant information and disregard other, irrelevant information. In
this context, individuals along the autistic spectrum appear to have a neurological
propensity to gate out social information and thus gain conscious access to highly
processed nonsocial perceptions and schemata. This section will look at how this might be
accomplished by focusing on eye contact, facial expression, oxytocin regulation,
macrocephaly, amygdala reactivity, and facial recognition in autism.
Curious phenomena that are very common in autism are averted gaze and poor eye
contact (Hutt and Ounsted, 1966). Autistic individuals describe eye contact as
uncomfortable and even threatening (Piven, 2000). Interestingly, eye contact is also very
rare in the vast majority of solitary species, including orangutans, who actively avoid both
direct gazing and even facing (Yamagiwa, 1992). Chimpanzees and gorillas share gazes
and use the eyes for communication frequently, just like most humans (Gomez, 1996).
Chimps and gorillas use eye contact constantly while interacting with members of their
own group but may charge at an individual from another group if it makes eye contact.
Staring between unfamiliar apes is often interpreted as a threat signal; therefore, it is best
for a solitary mammal to avoid both eye contact and direct gazing in order to forestall an
attack (Gomez, 1996). Orangutans actively avoid gazing and eye contact and this tendency,
very common among solitary animals, has been explicitly interpreted as adaptive for their
solitary foraging niche (Yamagiwa, 1992). Instead of face-to-face direct viewing,
orangutans, like individuals with autism, glance momentarily at others sideways with the
head turned away (Kaplan and Rogers, 1996). The neurological substrates (including
amygdalar sensitivity) that underlie this very specific and prominent tendency may have
evolved for the same adaptive, defensive reasons in both autistic individuals and
orangutans.
Studies have shown that autistic individuals are less expressive, especially with
respect to facial communication. They make fewer facial expressions and are rated as more
flat or neutral in affect by observers (Yirmija, Kasari, Sigman, and Mundy, 1989). This
absence of facial responsiveness is probably due to underlying neuronal mechanisms, and
there is evidence that the facial motor nucleus is significantly reduced in size in autism
(Rodier, Ingram, Tisdale, Nelson, and Romano, 1996). Fascinatingly, the size of the facial
motor nucleus is thought to vary predictably in total volume as a function of group size in
monkeys and apes. The larger the average group size, the more important facial
expressiveness is and the larger the facial motor nucleus must be (Sherwood, 2005). It
should be informative to analyze the anatomical organization of the autistic facial motor
nucleus, taking note of the general size, the placement of motor neurons, distribution of
neuron types and the general topography of muscle representation. Experts in phylogenetic
specializations of primate facial neurology might be able to perceive social or ecological
traits in the distinctive anatomical organization of the facial neural pathways in autism.
Analyzing it relative to that in orangutans should be informative as well, as it is known that
orangutans are much less facially expressive than other apes (Liebal, Pika, and Tomasello,
The solitary forager hypothesis
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 9(2). 2011. -226-
2006).
Oxytocin, a neuropeptide thought to enhance social learning, social expressiveness,
direct eye gaze and the ability to remember faces (Savaskan, Ehrhardt, Schulz, Walter, and
Schachniger, 2008), is reduced in autism subjects. Diminished peripheral levels of oxytocin
may play a large role in retuning social brain modules in autism (Green et al., 2001). It has
been shown that intravenous oxytocin produces a significant reduction in stereotypic
behaviors in adult autism subjects and increases empathy in people without autism
(Hollander et al., 2003). Variation in oxytocin levels in mammals reflects adaptations to the
social environment, just as it may in the case of autism. Animals that rely on pair-bonds
and social attachment have higher levels of plasma oxytocin, especially when it is
behaviorally relevant, like during childbirth or monogamous sex (Campbell, 2008).
Comparing prairie voles to montane voles, two very closely related species of rodent, is
interesting in this context because the two differ widely in bonding behavior. The montane
vole, relative to the prairie vole, has a much smaller number of receptors in the brain for
oxytocin and, unlike the amorous prairie voles, they do not form pair bonds (Marler, 1968).
The montane voles have fewer receptors and thus are less responsive to oxytocin, making
them more wary, suspicious and more easily frightened of other members of their species--
ensuring that they do not allow themselves to become vulnerable (Marler, 1968). It is
thought that the wide discrepancy in social behavior between these two species reflects
adaptation to two very different physical and social environments (Adolfs, 2001). Not
surprisingly, interspecific, seasonal and reproductive variation in oxytocin concentrations
have been attributed ecological and adaptive significance. High levels are associated with
trust, love, pair-bonding and generosity in a variety of mammals (Adolfs, 2001). It would
be interesting to compare the details of oxytocin action--such as receptor number and
distribution--in solitary animals with that of people with autism.
Diminished peripheral levels of oxytocin may cause individuals with autism to be
born "expecting" or prepared for a socially impoverished environment. Natural selection
cannot act on behavior directly but instead acts on the neural substrates that generate the
psychological mechanisms that create the behavior. Evolved psychological mechanisms,
such as cognitive modules, are generally understood in terms of specific inputs, decision
rules and outputs (Buss, 1995). Most of these mechanisms were naturally selected to be
sensitive to a narrow range of perceptual information. In other words, they are biologically
prepared to learn about or solve particular adaptive problems. Some mechanisms are
known to be domain-specific and many of these are assumed to exhibit variation in
humans, causing some people to attend to perceptual cues that others might miss entirely.
Tuning differences in domain-specific mechanisms or modules, especially those involving
oxytocin, serotonin and adrenaline, may underlie the differences in autistic cognition and,
like other differences seen in nature, may have been created by natural selection to help
solitary foragers face their particular set of recurrent or ecologically relevant threats and
opportunities.
It has been shown that one or both hippocampi are often significantly larger in
autism (Amaral et al., 2008). The hippocampus is a convergence zone that is integral to
spatial ability, and perhaps the large size of the hippocampus in autism has neuroecological
relevance. The study of neuroecology focuses heavily on the relationships between
The solitary forager hypothesis

ecological hardships, necessity for spatial ability and the size of the hippocampus
(Garamszegi and Eens, 2004). It might make sense that a solitary forager would have to
compensate for the fact that it could not rely on the spatial abilities of its companions.
Individuals with autism have also been shown to excel at the block design subtest of the
Wechsler intelligence scales, evidence of high visuospatial abilities (Bolte, Dziobek, and
Poustka, 2009). It may be possible that such abilities are indicative of the visuospatial or
mnemonic rigors particular to a solitary existence.
Brain growth is accelerated in early autism, and this may have been adaptive for a
youngster that was preparing to become a solitary forager. Individuals with autism have
been known for years to exhibit increased head circumference and increased brain size (two
highly correlated traits) during infancy (Dementieva et al., 2005). Macrocephaly (head
circumference higher than the 97th percentile), one of the most consistently encountered
traits seen in autism, is known to affect between 14% and 34% of all autistic infants (Fidler,
Bailey, and Smalley, 2000). In fact, total brain size, as revealed by MRI, is on average 5-
10% bigger in autism between 18 and 48 months of age (Mraz, Green, Dumont-Mathieu,
Makin, and Fein,, 2007). Neonates who will develop autism and macrocephaly exhibit
normal head circumference at birth, but their head growth accelerates during the first year
of life. This growth continues until at least 4 years of age, slows and then decelerates
prematurely (Dementieva et al., 2005). This increased rate of brain maturation and growth
slows early, well before nonautistic brains start to slow, resulting in very similar head sizes
between those with autism and those without in both adolescence and adulthood (Fidler
etal., 2000). A large contributor to increased brain size in youth is myelination, and it is
thought that different areas of the brain myelinate differentially according to an ecological
program where primary sensory areas begin to myelinate first, well before association
cortices. The dramatic increase in head circumference from birth until age 4 may be
evidence that the learning arc for a solitary forager is not as protracted as it is for other
children. Hunter-gatherer children need to laboriously and perseveringly learn a language
along with social morays, a time-consuming process (Kaplan et al., 2000). Researchers
have concluded that learning during human childhood takes so long because social
interactions are more variable and relatively less frequent than other forms of ecological
learning (Greenough, Black, and Wallace, 1987). The fact that individuals with autism
show this increase in head and brain size between birth and age 4 may indicate that they are
programmed to learn more about their environment, faster, at an earlier age. This may also
suggest that autism represents a precocial ("out of the nest early") strategy where learning
takes place very early so that the animal can become independent of its mother quickly, a
characteristic observed in countless nidifugous animals that do not have complex social
lives. Consistent with this conclusion are data evincing that many males with autism
exhibit precocious puberty (Tordjman, 1997), further evidence of a precocial as opposed to
an altricial strategy.
Other neurological differences particular to autism may hold neuroecological
significance. Individuals with autism have been widely reported to have increased fear
activity in the amygdala and high levels of anxiety (Baron-Cohen et al., 2000) which might
act to increase vigilance, caution and a healthy fear of strangers. It seems reasonable to
assume that a solitary forager would benefit more from such caution than would an
The solitary forager hypothesis

individual who must learn to embrace companions. Some frequently reported, but only
preliminarily researched, eccentricities in autism include acute and perceptive hearing, and
increased frequency of, and interest in, smelling (Leekam, Nieto, Libby, Wing, and Gould,
2007); two features that could certainly be interpreted in a neuroethological context. Face
processing, a key factor in the development of social perception, is severely impaired in
autism (Dalton et al., 2005). The area responsible for face recognition, the fusiform face
area, in particular has demonstrated reduced activation in autism during facial
discrimination tasks (Pierce and Redcay, 2008) indicating that in autism, like in many
solitary animal species, identity recognition may not be as valuable. These neurological
differences may be telling. If autism truly does represent a solitary phenotype, then the
brain abnormalities--which are highly consistent across individuals on the spectrum--
should furnish theoretically intriguing insights, not only into comparative cognition but
also into human evolution.
Implications of the Hypothesis
This article has attempted, in an exploratory manner, to provide a characterization
of autism that reconciles known findings with evolutionary theory. In the past it was not
understood how individuals on the autism spectrum might have gotten along during
prehistoric times. Yet now, a comparison with solitary species shows that autistic
individuals may have lived largely solitary lives and achieved self-sufficiency and
reproductive success. Characteristics of autism that have been interpreted as consistent with
the solitary forager hypothesis include: the high systemizing abilities, the obsessive and
perseverative tendencies, the repetitious and ritualistic tendencies, splinter skills, the deep
but narrow stores of knowledge, the parallels with orangutans and montane voles, gaze
aversion, absence of eye contact, increased hippocampal size, macrocephaly, precocious
puberty, the testosterone effect, reduced fusiform face area and facial motor nucleus
activity, amygdalar sensitivity, reduced oxytocin concentrations and the sex ratio. Clearly,
there are exceptions to each of the lines of evidence offered here. For instance, there are
innumerable functional differences between the social mind of an orangutan and that of the
average individual with autism. The growing body of experimental literature testing the
social-cognitive skills of solitary species may offer important insight into autistic traits
though and tell us more about the similarities and differences in these domains. It will be
very difficult to determine irrefutably if what we know as autism today was in fact an
adaptive phenotype in the ancestral past. The hypothesis presented here is underspecified
and vague but may be progressive as it is thought that analyzing disease states from an
evolutionary perspective can ultimately do much to inform and influence medical theory
and, ultimately, even intervention strategy (Nesse and Williams, 1995). Furthermore, the
evolutionary perspectives delineated here could potentially provide structure for empirical
investigations in animal behavior or cognitive neuroscience.
The case that the autism spectrum represents a solitary forager phenotype is a very
top-heavy argument that can and probably should be toned down in numerous ways. First,
individuals with autism were probably not totally solitary and may even have been better
adapted to very small groups than to a purely solitary existence. Second, it should be
The solitary forager hypothesis
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 9(2). 2011. -229-
emphasized that natural selection may have only been selecting for subclinical autistic traits
and that the high-functioning corner of the spectrum may have been the substrate for
natural selection. Third, the most severe cases of autism may actually have been
maladaptive and due to assortative mating of two individuals that hold a high number of
autism susceptibility genes. A comprehensive solitary forager theory of autism must
address these issues and should start by partitioning variation in autism into nosological
categories that represent either pathology or nature. This article has not clearly committed
to delineating which aspects of autism are adaptive and which are not, or even committed
to whether the lowest functioning forms could have had a place in nature. It is probably too
early to make these discriminations. However, it seems that if the extreme end of the
autism spectrum was selected for, that the distribution of autism prevalence relative to
severity might be bimodal or have a fattened tail, yet this does not seem to be the case.
It is probable that other endophenotypes and genetic patterns in autism can be
analyzed in terms of the present hypothesis to provide convergent evidence. Eventually,
genetic hypothesis testing could provide near incontrovertible proof for the present
hypothesis. Until then, comparing intron relative to exon mutations in susceptibility genes
for autism, mapping gene linkages, analyzing epigenetic patterns, scrutinizing genome-
wide microarray analyses, and even looking for inter and intraspecific trends in
genographic data may all provide support. Further comparative behavioral studies may also
be revealing. It will be instructive to look for abilities in autism that more closely resemble
foraging activities than the abilities mentioned here. Conversely, looking for
anthropological evidence for autism-like traits among successful foragers should also be
revealing. It is also important to question whether the processing deficits or cognitive
findings in autism might have put a solitary forager at a disadvantage. In order to further
explicate the evolutionary roots of autism and draw new inferences with the potential to
inform medical intervention, I encourage researchers to turn to ethology and Niko
Tinbergen's (1963) "four questions" in understanding the value of behavior: 1) what is the
immediate benefit to the organism? 2) What is the immediate consequence? 3) How does it
develop in the individual across ontogeny? 4) How did it evolve in species across
phylogeny? Knowledge about the costs and benefits of solitary existence may help to guide
each of these lines of research.
Oliver Sacks (1970) has formulated an interesting view of autism that appears to be
consistent with this. He points out that the perspective of the autistic individual appears
aboriginal because they never succumb to our modern societal conventions, but that this
does not keep them from perceiving, thinking and behaving in original, innovative and
intelligent ways:
The autistic by their nature are seldom open to influence. It is their "fate" to
be isolated and thus original. Their "vision," if it can be glimpsed, comes
from within and appears aboriginal. They seem to me, as I see more of them,
to be a strange species in our midst, odd, original, wholly inwardly directed,
unlike others. (p. 230)
Studies in behavioral genetics have demonstrated that tendencies for cooperation,
The solitary forager hypothesis

temperament, and sociality have biological underpinnings. Furthermore, they show
considerable variability within and between animal species (Frank, 1998). Tendencies for
independence, reclusiveness, introversion and other traits characteristic of autism certainly
show a great deal of variability between species (Trivers, 1985), but what about within
them? Perhaps populations of other social species, such as chimpanzees, have an equally
low but consistent prevalence of autistic individuals as well. No formal diagnostic criteria
are available for psychiatric or even social disabilities in other animals (Wilner, 1991), but
it would be interesting, although difficult, to see if there are analogues, or possibly
homologues of autism in other species. If there were homologues of autism in species
closely related to humans, it would be relatively easy to use molecular techniques to show
this given that the genes responsible could be identified. Looking at the evolutionary
signatures in the behavioral genetics of autism might tell us more about the variability in
life-history strategies of our ancestors. Many different factors could be invoked in such a
discussion, including behavioral neuroscience, cognitive primatology, the importance of
group membership to survival, fission-fusion sociality, mating strategies, maverick males,
paleoneurology, parenting methods, phenotypic plasticity, sexual selection, social and
affective neuroscience, pair bonds, territoriality, social hierarchy, and others.
Because humans are highly social, we like to think that complex societies
represent the crowning achievement of evolution.... Indeed, if group living
were the universally superior lifestyle, we would expect social species to
outnumber solitary ones, but exactly the opposite is true. Why? Almost
certainly because in many environments, the costs of living with others are
prohibitively high. (Alcock, 2001, p. 118)
Humans are an innately social and gregarious species. Their ancestral environment, like
that of chimpanzees, selected them to be this way (Foley and Gamble, 2009). It is probable
that as with all traits selected for by evolution, there are costs and benefits associated with
social predispositions and that the large variation in sociability in our species reflects the
large variability in selective forces in the past. The relative prevalence of autism is high
enough to suggest that it was a phenotype that was naturally selected for in the past, but
also low enough to suggest that it was rarely preferable to the socially typical alternative.
Perhaps the prevalence of the autism spectrum in modern human populations tells us
something profound about the frequency of forced solitude in ancestral times, the adaptive
value of social instincts and the plasticity of human cognitive strategies. Showing that
autism had ecological viability and that it exists today because of its success in the past
suggests that it should not be considered a disease, but instead a condition. It should not be
thought of as something to be ashamed of, but as something that represents individuality,
self-determination and autonomy.
