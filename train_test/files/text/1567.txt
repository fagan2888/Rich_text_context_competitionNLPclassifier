Objective. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is highly prevalent and disabling. Patients with radiographic knee OA may experi-
ence pain and functional impairment, which can diminish their health status. Our objective was to determine factors
associated with self-reported health status in a national population-based sample with radiographic knee OA.
Methods. Our sample included all of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-III)
participants who underwent a knee radiograph and were found to have radiographic OA (defined as Kellgren/Lawrence
grade 2 or higher). Self-reported health status was determined by asking the participant to rate their overall health as
excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. Self-reported health status was analyzed as an ordinal variable using cumulative
logit regression, as a dichotomous variable (excellent/very good/good versus fair/poor) using logistic regression, and as a
continuous variable after transformation using linear regression.
Results. A total of 1,021 (42%) of NHANES-III participants with a knee radiograph were included in this analysis. The
multivariable analyses were performed on 1,009 (99%) of the eligible participants with complete data. We found that
nonwhite race, lower income, more comorbidities, and greater functional limitation were associated with worse self-
reported health status in all 3 multivariable analyses.
Conclusion. This study has quantified the role of clinical, radiographic, and socioeconomic factors associated with
self-reported health status in a population-based sample of patients with knee OA. Self-reported health status in patients
with knee OA was associated with functional status and comorbidity.
INTRODUCTION
Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is painful, disabling, and costly,
and diminishes a person's health status dramatically. Over
10 million people in the US have knee OA (1) and OA of
the knee is one of the 5 leading causes of disability among
the elderly (2).
Health status is a multidimensional domain comprising
biologic, physical, and emotional functioning (3,4). Self-
reported health status is a measure of how one perceives
and reports one's own well-being. For example, partici-
pants may rate their health as excellent, very good, good,
fair, or poor. This sort of self-reported information pro-
vides an important indicator of a person's health status (4).
A variety of methods have been proposed to express self-
reported health status (5). One method is to classify the
responses into 2 groups (excellent, very good, or good
versus fair or poor) (5). Another method is to analyze the
responses as an ordinal variable (5). Lastly, a particularly
transparent approach is to express self-reported health
status on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 corresponds to the
worst possible health and 1 corresponds to perfect health.
Such scales are easy to interpret, and the unitless 0 to 1
response scale permits comparisons across medical condi-
tions (3).
Many studies have documented the effect of knee OA, as
well as other specific conditions, on the self-reported
health status of patients' lives (6,7). Few studies, however,

have attempted to characterize or explain variability in
self-reported health status within specific conditions. For
example, the Beaver Dam Health Outcomes Study exam-
ined the influence of dozens of conditions on self-reported
health status, but only controlled for age. The study did
not examine the contribution of comorbidities, the severity
of disease symptoms, or other patient characteristics on
self-reported health status (6). Another study, conducted
among subjects enrolled in Pennsylvania's Pharmaceutical
Assistance Contract for the Elderly (PACE), examined the
effect of OA and rheumatoid arthritis on self-reported
health status compared with no arthritis. This study con-
trolled for important factors, including age, sex, race, in-
come, and comorbidities. However, the diagnosis was not
specific to knees, and radiographs were not used to deter-
mine the presence of OA (7).
Our objective was to determine the factors associated
with self-reported health status in a national population-
based sample of persons with radiographic knee OA. We
chose participants affected by radiographic knee OA so
that we could examine the impact of symptomatic OA on
a person's self-reported health status. We used data from
the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES-III), which is the most recent NHANES to
perform radiographs of the knee, in order to identify fac-
tors that correlate with self-reported health status in indi-
viduals in a population-based sample with radiographic
knee OA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample. The NHANES-III is a national population-
based survey that was conducted from 1988­1994 by the
National Centers for Health Statistics of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. The survey was con-
ducted in 2 phases. Phase I took place from 1988­1991,
and phase II from 1991­1994. The NHANES-III survey
data were collected during a household interview. All
participants were then asked to schedule an appointment
at a medical examination center where additional data
would be collected. Additional details about patient re-
cruitment and selection for the NHANES-III survey have
been previously described (8).
Radiographic assessment. The knee radiographs were
performed using a non­weight-bearing anteroposterior ap-
proach according to the NHANES-III protocol (9). Radio-
graphs were performed on both knees of all participants
surveyed between 1991 and 1994 who were 60 years of
age and could transfer themselves to the radiograph table
under their own power. Severity of radiographic knee OA
was defined by Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) grade, where 0 
no knee OA, 1  a questionable osteophyte (doubtful knee
OA), 2  a definite osteophyte but no joint space narrow-
ing (mild knee OA), 3  moderate narrowing of the joint
space (moderate knee OA), and 4  severe narrowing of
the joint space (severe knee OA) (10). K/L grades were
computed for each knee by a trained radiologist. For our
analysis we used the greater of the right and left K/L
grades, and we defined radiographic knee OA as having a
K/L grade of 2. This definition served as the inclusion
criterion for this analysis.
Outcome: self-reported health status. Self-reported
health status was determined by asking the participant to
rate their overall health as excellent, very good, good, fair,
or poor. Self-reported health status was analyzed using 3
techniques. First, self-reported health status was dichoto-
mized as excellent, very good, or good versus fair or poor.
Next, we considered self-reported health as an ordinal
variable. Finally, we assigned each possible response a
rating. To address the issue of transforming ordinal vari-
ables into a rating scale using equal-length intervals, we
used the rating scale proposed by Diehr and colleagues
(11). Values of 0.95, 0.90, 0.80, 0.30, and 0.15 were as-
signed to the 5 possible responses, respectively (11). The
rating scale was then transformed to an estimate of stan-
dard gamble utilities (0 to 1, representing the worst to the
best possible health) using the power transformation sug-
gested by Torrance and colleagues to create a continuous
self-reported health status score, which is often called a
utility score in economic evaluations (12).
Correlates of self-reported health status. Sociodemo-
graphic characteristics. Sociodemographic factors such as
age, sex, race/ethnicity, and income were hypothesized to
be associated with self-reported health status. Age was
classified into 5 categories: 60­64 years old, 65­69 years
old, 70­74 years old, 75­79 years old, and 80 years old.
Race/ethnicity was classified into 3 categories: Hispanic,
non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic white. Income was
also classified into 4 categories: $20,000, $20,000­
$34,999, $35,000, and missing. The missing category was
added so that participants who did not report their income
could be included in the multivariable regression models.
Comorbidities. The NHANES-III included several
closed-ended questions about the participant's medical
problems at the time of the survey or in the past. A comor-
bidity index was computed by counting the total number
of self-reported medical problems. These medical prob-
lems included asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema,
congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, el-
evated cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cancer
(including skin cancer), fractures of the hip, wrist, or
spine, gout, lupus, osteoporosis, back pain most days for
1 month, goiter, urinary tract infection, pneumonia in
the last 12 months, blindness, cataracts, and thyroid dis-
ease. We then categorized the total number of comorbidi-
ties into 3 levels: 0­1 comorbidities, 2­3 comorbidities,
and 4 comorbidities. Obesity status was considered as a
separate factor and was defined as nonobese (body mass
index [BMI] 30 kg/m2), obese (BMI 30 kg/m2), and
missing (13). The missing category for obesity status was
added so that participants with missing BMI values could
be included in the multivariable regression model.
Radiographic severity, knee pain, and functional limita-
tion. Severity of radiographic knee OA was classified us-
ing K/L grades. We analyzed K/L grade as a categorical
variable (grades 2, 3, and 4). Knee pain was defined as
having knee pain on most days for at least 6 weeks. A
Self-Reported Health Status in a Population With Knee OA 1047
composite functional limitation index was defined from 2
questions in the household interview: difficulty walking a
quarter of a mile, and difficulty stooping, crouching, or
kneeling. The participants were assumed to have reported
zero limitations if they answered "No" to both questions, 1
limitation if they answered "Yes" to one of the questions,
and 2 limitations if they answered "Yes" to both questions.
We performed internal validation of the index by examin-
ing its association with radiographic severity and the use
of a walking aid, such as a cane or walker.
Statistical analysis. The interview and examination
data sets were merged to produce a single data set that
contained all of the relevant information. Three analyses
were performed, one for each of the 3 techniques of exam-
ining the outcome of self-reported health status.
For self-reported health status as a dichotomous vari-
able, multivariable logistic regression was performed on
our dichotomous outcome to obtain odds ratios (ORs) of
being in fair or poor health.
For self-reported health status as an ordinal variable,
multivariable cumulative logit regression was performed
on our ordinal outcome to obtain cumulative ORs. Cumu-
lative ORs that were 1 were more indicative of worse
self-reported health status.
For self-reported health status as a continuous variable,
we used 2-sample independent t-tests and one-way analy-
sis of variance to compare unadjusted mean estimates of
our self-reported health status score for our hypothesized
correlates. We employed multivariable linear regression to
obtain adjusted mean estimates of the self-reported health
status score. Scheffe's procedure was used to adjust for
multiple comparisons where appropriate (14).
We tested for interactions to identify specific subgroups
that reported a worse self-reported health status for all 3
variants of the outcome. The interaction between radio-
graphic severity and knee pain was of particular interest,
but we also examined interactions involving functional
limitation with comorbidity, comorbidity with obesity,
and sex with radiographic severity, comorbidity, and obe-
sity. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statisti-
cal software, version 9.1 (SAS, Cary, NC).
We employed survey regression methods as a sensitivity
analysis to take into account the survey design. We did not
use the sampling weights in this analysis because the
variables used to determine the weights (age, sex, and
race/ethnicity) were also predictors of interest (15). The
methods used in our data analyses were consistent with a
more detailed discussion of the use of sampling weights
for the NHANES analyses (15,16). The results that took
into account the possible correlations between individuals
within primary sampling units and strata were analogous
to the standard multiple linear regression and are not
presented here because the results would be redundant.
RESULTS
Study sample. A total of 2,586 participants completed
the NHANES-III household questionnaire and underwent
the physical examination. Of the 2,586 participants, 2,412
(93%) had a K/L score evaluated on at least 1 knee. Of
these, 1,021 (42%) had radiographic knee OA (K/L grade
2), which comprised the sample for this analysis.
The baseline demographic features of the sample are
presented in Table 1. The average age was 73 years and the
sample primarily consisted of women (61%). A substantial
portion of the sample consisted of racial/ethnic minorities
(46%), and 55% of the participants reported annual in-
comes $20,000. Seventy-six percent had 2 comorbid
conditions, and 25% were obese. Seventy-one percent had

tion.
Internal validation of the functional limitation index.
The functional limitation index was highly correlated with
radiographic severity and the self-reported use of a walk-
ing aid. Seventeen percent of participants who reported no
functional limitations had a K/L grade of 4, whereas 51%
of participants who reported 2 functional limitations had a
K/L grade of 4. Also, 6% of participants who reported zero
functional limitations used a walking aid, compared with
74% who reported 2 functional limitations (Figure 1).
Correlates of self-reported health status. Dichotomous
outcome. Results of the multivariable logistic regression
are shown in Table 2. We found that clinical (functional
limitation and comorbidity) and socioeconomic (race/eth-
nicity and income) factors were associated with self-
reported health status, but not radiographic factors. Those
with 1 functional limitation (OR 1.68, 95% confidence
interval [95% CI] 1.13­2.48) or 2 functional limitations
(OR 4.42, 95% CI 2.95­6.64) were more likely to be in fair
or poor health than those with zero functional limitations.
Those with 2 or 3 comorbidities (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.76­
4.10) or 4 comorbidities (OR 5.49, 95% CI 3.48­8.66)
were more likely to be in fair or poor health than those
reporting zero or 1 comorbidities. Non-Hispanic blacks
(OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.56­3.43) and Hispanics (OR 2.94, 95%
CI 1.97­4.39) were more likely to be in fair or poor health
than non-Hispanic whites. Those making $35,000 (OR
0.44, 95% CI 0.27­0.72) were less likely to be in fair or
poor health than those making $20,000. We did not find
a statistically significant association between age, sex, obe-
sity status, K/L grade, or knee pain status and self-reported
health status in this model.
Ordinal outcome. Results of the multivariable cumula-
tive logit regression yielded similar results as the multiva-
riable logistic regression and are also presented in Table 2.
Functional limitation, comorbidity, race/ethnicity, and in-
come remained associated with self-reported health status.
The multivariable cumulative logit regression model also
showed that age and sex were associated with self-
reported health status. NHANES-III participants who were
80 years old (cumulative OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42­0.93)
were less likely to have a lower self-reported health status
than those who were between the ages of 60­64 years.
Also, men (cumulative OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.03­1.68) were
more likely to have a lower self-reported health status than
women.
Continuous health status score. The mean  SD self-
reported health status score for the entire sample was
0.81  0.24. The unadjusted and adjusted mean self-
reported health status scores are shown in Table 3. K/L
grade and knee pain both had a substantial influence on
self-reported health status scores in the unadjusted analy-
sis (P  0.01 and P  0.01, respectively). However, these 2
variables were not associated with self-reported health
status scores in the multivariable regression (P  0.21 and
P  0.71, respectively). Participants with increased func-
tional limitation experienced significantly lower self-
reported health status scores (P  0.01 for unadjusted and
adjusted analyses) (Table 3). In the adjusted analysis, those
reporting zero functional limitations had a mean self-
reported health status score of 0.85 (95% CI 0.82­0.89),
whereas those reporting 2 functional limitations had a
mean self-reported health status score of 0.70 (95% CI
0.67­0.73).
Comorbidities greatly influenced self-reported health
status scores in this sample. The relationship between
comorbidities and the self-reported health status score
stratified by functional limitation is shown in Figure 2.
Although the interaction between comorbidities and func-
tional limitation with respect to the relationship with self-
reported health status scores was not statistically signifi-
cant, there was a trend in decrement in self-reported
health status due to worsening functional status and in-
creasing comorbidity (Figure 2).
Race/ethnicity was among the factors influencing self-
reported health status scores. Results of the multivariable
analysis revealed that non-Hispanic whites had a signifi-
cantly higher mean self-reported health status score (mean
0.86; 95% CI 0.82­0.89) than both non-Hispanic blacks
(mean 0.77; 95% CI 0.73­0.80) and Hispanics (mean 0.75;
95% CI 0.71­0.78).
Income was also associated with self-reported health
status in both the unadjusted and the adjusted analyses
(P  0.01 for both analyses). The multivariable analysis
showed an association between sex and self-reported
health status (P  0.03), but not between age and self-
reported health status (P  0.27). Obesity was associated
with lower self-reported health status in the unadjusted
analysis (P  0.01), but not in the adjusted analysis (P 
0.35).
Interactions. We did not find evidence that K/L grade
modifies the relationship between functional limitation
and self-reported health status; the interaction between
K/L grade and knee pain was not statistically significant in
any of the multivariable analyses. In fact, none of the
interactions that we tested were statistically significant in
any of the multivariable regression models.

Self-Reported Health Status in a Population With Knee OA 1049
DISCUSSION
We conducted an analysis to determine correlates of self-
reported health status in individuals with radiographic
knee OA among NHANES-III participants. Although we
found clear evidence that a greater number of comorbidi-
ties and a higher degree of functional limitation were
associated with worse self-reported health status, neither
radiographic severity of OA nor knee pain influenced self-
reported health status in analyses that adjusted for func-
tional status. Furthermore, we did not find evidence of
modification of the effect of knee pain on self-reported
health status by K/L grade. That is, although radiographs
provide the most widely acknowledged indicator of OA
severity, this parameter did not appear to influence self-

reported health status in our sample. Although the fact
that we found an association between functional limita-
tion and self-reported health status was not surprising, the
magnitude of the decrement in self-reported health status
for those with 2 functional limitations was quite striking.
Additionally, we found that demographic and socioeco-
nomic factors including nonwhite race and lower income
were also associated with lower self-reported health status
in all 3 multivariable regression models.
Obese participants had, on average, lower self-reported
health status scores than nonobese participants in the un-
adjusted analysis (0.83 versus 0.78; P  0.01). This rela-
tionship was not seen when the other factors in the model
were adjusted for (P  0.35). This is most likely due to the
fact that obese participants also experience some of the
comorbidities that we accounted for in our summative co-
morbidity index, and the fact that obesity is correlated with
other factors in the model (e.g., functional status), leaving no

* Unadjusted mean estimates of the self-reported health status score came from independent sample
t-tests when the variable had 2 levels and from one-way analysis of variance when the variable had 3
levels. Adjusted mean estimates of the self-reported health status score came from the multivariable linear
regression model. The 95% CIs are adjusted for multiple comparisons using Scheffe's procedure for both
the unadjusted and adjusted analyses. See Table 2 for definitions.

Self-Reported Health Status in a Population With Knee OA 1051
additional variance in the self-reported health status score to
be explained by obesity after adjusting for the variables that
were included in the multiple regression model. Finally, we
examined interactions involving functional limitation, knee
pain, radiographic severity, obesity, comorbidity, and sex,
but we were unable to find any that further explained the
variability in self-reported health status.
To the best of our knowledge, there are no prior studies
evaluating correlates of self-reported health status in a
population-based sample of individuals with evidence of
radiographic knee OA. The Beaver Dam Health Outcomes
Study derived age-adjusted mean estimates of a true health
utility using the time trade-off technique in patients with
arthritis, but not specifically radiographic knee OA (6). In
their age-adjusted analysis, which adjusted for the mean
age of 64.1 years in their sample, they found that partici-
pants with arthritis had a health utility of 0.82 (95% CI
0.80­0.83) (6). This result was consistent with the overall
mean self-reported health status score (0.81) that we de-
scribed in this report, even though the mean age in our
sample was 73 years. This is due to the fact that age was
not associated with self-reported health status in 2 of our
analyses. The association seen between age and our ordi-
nal self-reported health status outcome is likely due to a
healthy survivor effect because patients age 80 years
were more likely to report being in better health than those
who were between the ages of 60­65 years. The advantage
of our study is that it provides more detailed information
about factors that are associated with self-reported health
status in patients with knee OA, which allows further
discrimination of self-reported health status among per-
sons with knee OA.
Our results are consistent with other studies that exam-
ined the impact of race and income on self-reported health
status (7,17­19). The study using subjects enrolled in
Pennsylvania's PACE demonstrated findings similar to
what we found with regard to race, income, and comor-
bidities, but not age. The authors analyzed the general
health status question as a dichotomous variable (excel-
lent, very good, or good versus fair or poor) as well (7).
Subjects age 85 years were more likely to respond as
having fair or poor health than those between the ages of
65­74 years, but they were less likely to respond as having
fair or poor health than those between the ages of 75­84
years (7). The authors also found that nonwhite race, lower
income, and more comorbidities were associated with
worse self-reported health status (7), which is concordant
with our results. However, our sample is a national sam-
ple, whereas PACE is restricted to residents in Pennsylva-
nia. Also, our additional use of a continuous measure
allows for further discrimination and estimates that can be
used in economic evaluations.
There are several limitations to our study, including that
the estimates provided in this manuscript are not popula-
tion-based estimates. One is that NHANES-III used non­
weight-bearing knee radiographs. This may lead to under-
estimation of the presence and severity of radiographic
knee OA (20), and could potentially reduce the influence
of radiographic severity on self-reported health status.
Also, patellofemoral OA is not assessed formally in the
K/L grading system. Since patellofemoral OA may be quite
painful, this may adversely influence self-reported health
status. We acknowledge that the cumulative logit regres-
sion model may not meet the proportional odds assump-
tion in this case. However, because the test for proportion-
ality of odds can be overly sensitive in the presence of
large samples, we used it as a secondary analysis that
confirmed many of the same relationships as ordinary
logistic regression.
Another limitation of this study is that we were not able
to determine causality or observe how self-reported health
status changes over time due to the cross-sectional design
of the study. As with any observational study, we ac-
knowledge the possibility of not accounting for other con-
founders, which may explain additional variability in self-
reported health status. This includes OA in other joints,
which were not formally ascertained in NHANES-III. It
would be important to study the effect of changes in dis-
ease severity, symptoms, and comorbidities on changes in
self-reported health status over time. We recognize that
estimating the effect of missing obesity status and income
on self-reported health status may lead to biased estimates
with respect to these 2 variables if the data is not missing
completely at random. We acknowledge that our continu-
ous outcome (the transformed rating scale) is an estimate
and not a directly elicited standard gamble utility (12).
Further research should be done in samples in which
utilities would be elicited using direct assessment. Lastly,
we recognize that the various comorbidities included in
our summative index may not be equal contributions to
one's self-reported health status. However, creating a sin-
gle comorbidity index with equal weights seemed to pro-
vide adequate adjustment in our model while accounting
for the fact that each comorbidity was relatively rare. This
simplification, which has been done in other studies look-
ing at the impact of comorbidity on self-reported health
status (4), would result in a conservative bias, making it
more difficult to detect the influence of comorbidities on
self-reported health status.
We found that more comorbidities, a higher degree of
functional limitation, nonwhite race, and lower income
were associated with a worse self-reported health status in

error bars represent 95% confidence intervals for the adjusted
mean, and the width is adjusted using Scheffe's procedure.

These results point to subpopulations of patients with
knee OA at risk for experiencing worse health. From a
clinical point of view, health-enhancing interventions
could be aimed especially at these subpopulations. From a
research standpoint, these patient characteristics should
be noted as potential confounders in studies of self-
reported health status in knee OA. Further research needs
to be done to evaluate how self-reported health status
changes in patients as their disease severity and symptoms
progress or recede.
