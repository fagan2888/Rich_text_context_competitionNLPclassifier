Article
Questions concerning how people regulate their own cogni-
tive processes have attracted an abundant amount of research
for decades. Studies on self-regulation, particularly on its
role in learning, have been prolific since the mid-1980s
(Zimmerman, 2001). The rationale behind the increasing
emphasis on the importance of self-regulated learning can be
attributed to the common awareness among researchers and
practitioners that learners' self-regulatory capacity greatly
enhances their performance outcomes.
Self-regulation is defined as a state of learning that involves
learners' metacognition, strategic action, and motivation to
learn (Butler & Winne, 1995; Perry, Phillips, & Hutchinson,
2006; Winne & Perry, 2000; Zimmerman, 1990, 2001).
Several researchers have investigated the effectiveness of self-
regulated learning in various content areas, such as mathemat-
ics (De Corte, Mason, Depaepe, & Verschaffel, 2011) and
science (Sinatra & Taasoobshirazi, 2011). The empirical evi-
dence generally supports that learners who take initiatives to
set realistic learning goals and subsequently achieve the goals
by utilizing proper learning strategies tend to have more satis-
factory performance outcomes than their peers.
Despite that self-regulated learning has been examined in
numerous educational settings and has proven to be effective
in facilitating learning processes, few empirical studies have
been conducted in the context of second language learning.
Given that self-regulatory capacity is a crucial characteristic
for learners to maintain confidence and motivation even
when faced with obstacles, the importance of its role in
enhancing the process of second language learning becomes
apparent. One of the first attempts at investigating self-regu-
lation in second language learning is a study done by Tseng,
Dörnyei, and Schmitt (2006). In their work, Tseng et al.
introduced a new instrument, the Self-Regulating Capacity
in Vocabulary Learning (SRCvoc) Scale, to measure second
language learners' self-regulation in the context of vocabu-
lary learning.
The theoretical conceptualization of the SRCvoc Scale,
proposed by Dörnyei (2005), is formed on the basis of Kuhl's
(1987) and Corno and Kanfer's (1993) action and volitional
control theories. Each descriptor in the SRCvoc Scale is
designed to fit into one of the five categories in Dörnyei's
(2005) taxonomy of self-regulation. The categories include
commitment control, which helps learners preserve their
commitment to the learning goals; metacognition control,
which allows learners to monitor their own learning behavior
to concentrate and avoid procrastination; satiation control,
which helps learners minimize boredom in learning; emotion
control, which helps learners manage their emotions during
the learning process; and environmental control, which
allows learners to facilitate learning by putting themselves in

Measuring Self-Regulation in Second
Language Learning: A Rasch Analysis
Heidi Han-Ting Liu1 and Young-Sun Lee1
Abstract
Self-regulation has become a widely discussed subject in education as it facilitates learners' ability to master their own
learning. The purpose of the present study is to examine the psychometric properties of self-regulation in second language
learning via Rasch measurement. A total of 528 high-school students from an East Asian country participated in the study,
and the Self-Regulating Capacity in English Language Learning (SRClang) Scale was used as a self-report instrument. The
results suggest that self-regulation in second language learning as measured by the SRClang Scale does not appear to be
unidimensional. Based on item-model fit statistics, several items in the SRClang Scale may need to be revised or removed.
Nonetheless, the response categories in the SRClang Scale function well as intended, and the scale can reliably separate
items and persons based on their difficulty levels and ability trait levels, respectively. Overall, the SRClang Scale serves as an
appropriate measure of self-regulatory capacity in second language learning.

a positive learning environment. With empirical evidence
from a series of elaborate statistical analyses, the SRCvoc
Scale was shown to serve as a useful instrument for the mea-
surement of self-regulation in vocabulary learning. Tseng
et al. (2006) further concluded that second language learners'
self-regulatory capacity in vocabulary learning can be attrib-
uted to all five traits outlined by the self-regulation taxon-
omy (i.e., commitment control, metacognition control,
satiation control, emotion control, and environment control)
as initially conceptualized.
While the SRCvoc Scale allows for the investigation of the
underlying traits of second language learners' self-regulatory
capacity in vocabulary learning, several researchers have
pointed out that the scale has not been fully "utilized and vali-
dated" in other aspects of second language learning (Mizumoto
& Takeuchi, 2012, p. 84). Noting the need to further under-
stand the role of self-regulation in second language learning in
a more generalized manner, Liu (2009) adapted Tseng et al.'s
(2006) SRCvoc Scale and developed the Self-Regulating
Capacity in English Language Learning (SRClang) Scale, a
questionnaire that can be used to collect information regarding
learners' self-regulatory capacity in their overall second lan-
guage learning experience. The results in general indicated
that the revised form of the SRCvoc Scale (i.e., the SRClang
Scale) can be reliably applied to the context of English lan-
guage learning. The detailed findings in terms of the underly-
ing traits of self-regulation, however, differed from those
shown in Tseng et al. While Tseng et al. suggested that the
underlying traits of self-regulation in vocabulary learning con-
form to the five controls conceptualized in the scale (commit-
ment control, metacognition control, satiation control, emotion
control, and environment control), Liu found that the construct
of self-regulation in the SRClang Scale only answers to one
psychometric property. In other words, the underlying trait of
self-regulation in second language learning appears to be uni-
dimensional in nature.
Nevertheless, it is important to note a major limitation to
the analysis conducted by Liu (2009): There was no confir-
matory statistical procedure beyond exploratory factor anal-
ysis to further validate the claim of the unidimensionality of
self-regulation as suggested by the SRClang Scale. In an
attempt to compare factor analysis and Rasch measurement,
Waugh and Chapman (2005) found that with the same sets of
data, Rasch measurement suggests less certainty in score
reliability and construct dimensionality than factor analysis
does, calling into question the statistical inferences made
from factor analysis. Given that Rasch models have been
considered a confirmatory type of measurement (Christensen,
2012; Rasch, 1960, 1961) that provides rigorous evidence of
dimensionality as well as item fit, the present study aims to
reexamine the psychometric properties of the SRClang Scale
using Rasch measurement. Specifically, item-model fit,
response category use, dimensionality, appropriateness of
item difficulty level for sample, and reliability measures (i.e.,
separation reliability and separation index) were analyzed to
have a more holistic view of the underlying trait(s) of self-
regulation as depicted in the SRClang Scale.
Method
Participants
A total of 528 English language learners from an East Asian
country participated in the present study. Excluding the
unidentified data, there were 243 males and 258 females.
The participants were recruited from 15 intact 10th- and
11th-grade classes in three public high schools. All of the
participants had been learning English as a foreign language
as a required course for a minimum of 5 years when the pres-
ent study was administered. In general, the participants'
English proficiency level as a group could be considered
approximately at the B1 level of the Common European
Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).1
Instrument
The SRClang Scale (Liu, 2009) was used to collect the data
concerning second language learners' self-regulatory capac-
ity in English learning. Considering that the present study
was conducted in an English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL)
learning context, the items were translated into the partici-
pants'native language to avoid construct-irrelevant variables
introduced by the participants' second language proficiency
(for the detailed procedure of questionnaire adaptation and
translation, see Liu, 2009).
Reduced with empirical evidence from the original
SRClang item bank (k = 33), the finalized form of the
SRClang Scale has 27 items. A 4-point Likert-type scale of
"disagree," "slightly disagree," "slightly agree," and "agree"
was used, and the participants were asked to check the appro-
priate box that best describes their English learning experi-
ences. A summary of the SRClang Scale and its item-control
taxonomy correspondence is provided in Table 1.
Data Coding
The participants'responses to the items in the SRClang Scale
were coded in accordance with the arranged Likert-type
scale as described in the "Instrument" section. To be more
specific, "disagree" was coded as 1, "slightly disagree" as 2,
"slightly agree" as 3, and "agree" as 4. Items 1, 19, 20, 21,
and 27 were reverse-coded due to the negative nature of the
item descriptions.
Data Analysis
The Rasch model. Conventionally, the Rasch model (Rasch,
1960) is used to estimate the conditional probability that a
person j endorses an item i, given the person's ability and the
item's difficulty level for dichotomously scored items:

and

is the difficulty parameter for item i ( , , , )
i k
=1 2  . To
illustrate, when person j's ability parameter and item i's dif-
ficulty parameter are equivalent (i.e., 
j
= 
i
), the probability
estimate of person j obtaining the correct response to, or
agreeing with item i, is .5. When person j has a greater ability
level than item i requires (i.e., 
j
> 
i
), person j's probability
of answering item i correctly or agreeing with item i is greater
than .5. The Rasch model places the person parameter and
the item parameter on the same metric of logits for the esti-
mation of person ability and item difficulty. To meet the
Rasch requirement of invariance of comparisons, the rela-
tionship between the parameters should be linear (Bond &
Fox, 2007; Rasch, 1977; Schumacker & Smith, 2007).
The rating scale model (RSM).Because the Rasch model is
specifically used for dichotomous items, an extension of the
Rasch model, the RSM (Andrich, 1978; Wright & Masters,
1982), is used to generalize the Rasch analysis to polytomous
responses. The RSM dictates that, for the items with m

0. The equation describes the
probability of person n choosing a specific category x on a
particular item i. RSM is characterized by two parameters:
item location parameter, i , and category intersection
parameter, i ; the former can be interpreted as the relative
difficulty of an item, whereas the latter represents the cate-
gory threshold parameter, which is assumed to be constant
across all items in the RSM. Therefore, each item in the RSM
is described by a single parameter i on the latent trait scale.
Given that the SRClang Scale uses a 4-point Likert-type
scale, the RSM is suitable for analyzing the SRClang data
because both assume constant thresholds for each item,
which is a common characteristic found in scales that mea-
sure personality or attitude (Lee, Grossman, & Krishnan,
2008). Such scales have two features: The relative difficul-
ties of steps within items should remain constant (Embretson
& Reise, 2000), and the psychological distances between
response categories (e.g., disagree and slightly disagree,
slight disagree and slightly agree) should be assumed the
same for all items (Fox & Jones, 1998). The described fea-
tures fit the underlying assumptions in the construction of the
SRClang Scale.
The SRClang Scale was analyzed for the properties of the
item-model fit, response category, adherence to the unidi-
mensionality assumption, appropriateness of item difficulty
level for the sample, and reliability. Items were reverse-
coded when necessary before performing the analysis.
WINSTEPS (Linacre, 2005b) was used to conduct the Rasch
analysis. As the proportion of the missing data was minimal
(<0.19%), WINSTEPS was able to treat the raw score and
the counts of nonmissing observations as sufficient statistics
and perform estimations accordingly.
Item-model fit. The item fit statistics show how well the items
fit the model. To determine whether the assumption of unidi-
mensionality of the SRClang Scale was met in the Rasch
model, the values of the item fit mean square (MNSQ) statis-
tics were calculated to investigate the extent to which each
item represented the underlying construct.
The infit (weighted) and outfit (unweighted) MNSQ sta-
tistics were used to measure the fit of the items. While infit
statistics are sensitive to abnormal patterns within the obser-
vations made by persons on the items that match their ability
levels, outfit statistics are sensitive to outliers as well as
abnormal patterns within the observations made by persons
on the items that do not match their ability levels (Linacre,
2005b). Ideally, the MNSQ value in the Rasch model should
be 1.0, indicating that the item fits the model perfectly.
However, perfect fit does not always happen. For an RSM,
researchers generally consider a range between 0.6 and 1.4 to
be acceptable MNSQ values (Lee et al., 2008; Linacre,
2005a; Wright & Linacre, 1994). That is, an item would be
considered misfitting if its MNSQ value falls out of this

range. Items that are underfitting suggest that high levels of
noise or other variance are introduced in the data; such items
"may distort or degrade the measurement system" (Wright &
Linacre, 1994, p. 370). However, those that are overfitting
indicate that the model predicts the data too well; such items,
while not degrading, are potentially problematic because
they "may produce misleadingly good reliabilities and sepa-
rations" (Wright & Linacre, 1994, p. 370).
Response category use. In Rasch measurement, response cat-
egory use is examined via category use statistics (i.e., cate-
gory frequencies, average measures) and the thresholds of
each category. The average measure for each category is the
empirical mean of the ability of the people who respond in
that category (Linacre, 2005a). The thresholds are boundar-
ies between categories, representing the measures where
adjacent categories are equally probable. If response catego-
ries are appropriately used, that is, higher and lower catego-
ries are responded to by persons with higher and lower
ability estimates, both the average measures and the thresh-
olds should increase monotonically as the response catego-
ries ascend.
Item difficulty level. Rasch analysis produces maps of persons
and items to graphically illustrate how item difficulty levels
overlap with person ability trait levels. Rasch model esti-
mates item difficulty parameters and person ability trait lev-
els using "logits" (i.e., log-odd units), and logits "form an
equal interval linear scale" (Wright, 1993, p. 288). Such fea-
tures allow the two parameters to be compared at the same
time for the purpose of determining whether the scale's item
difficulty matches the ability level of the person. If the item
difficulty level of the scale is appropriate for the sample of
persons, there would be a sufficient amount of overlap on the
map when comparing the parameters of items and persons.
Reliability measures.Statistics of separation reliability and
separation index for both persons and items are measures of
reliability in Rasch measurement (Wright & Masters, 1982).
Separation reliability estimates show the degree to which the
scale is able to differentiate persons or items on the measured
variables; it is the Rasch equivalent to Cronbach's alpha for
RSMs. The values of separation reliability should range
between 0 and 1, with .8 or greater being acceptable (Fox &
Jones, 1998). Separation index estimates show the spread of
persons or items on the measured variables. The separation
index provides a measure of separation in standard error
units and should be at least 2 to indicate adequate separation
for persons, items, or both.
Dimensionality.Rasch-residual-based principal components
analysis (PCA) was performed to investigate the dimension-
ality of the SRClang Scale.As explained by Linacre (2005a),
PCA decomposes the item correlation matrix based on stan-
dardized residuals, or the differences between the observed
and the hypothesized, so that other potential dimensions
may be identified. It is also considered "a standard proce-
dure of dimensionality checking" in Rasch measurement
(Chou & Wang, 2010, p. 728). For a model to be considered
unidimensional, one commonly acknowledged rule of
thumb is that the model needs to have a variance of at least
60% accounted for by the Rasch dimension in its first factor
of the PCA (Linacre, 2005a). The second dimension, or the
first contrast in the residuals, indicates whether there are any
patterns in the differences within the residuals large enough
to suggest multiple dimensions. To be considered a possible
second dimension, the secondary dimension should have the
strength of at least three items, as measured by its Eigen-
value, that represent more than 5% of the unexplained vari-
ance. Smith (2002) proposed that, for RSMs, having a first
Eigenvalue greater than 1.5 is considered a violation of uni-
dimensionality under the research condition of 500 persons
and 30 items. Given that the present study has more than
500 participants and close to 30 items, it is plausible to also
adopt the 1.5 Eigenvalue cutoff-point criterion in the inves-
tigation of dimensionality.
Results
Item-Model Fit
The item-model fit for the SRClang Scale was measured by
infit (weighted) and outfit (unweighted) MNSQ statistics. In
the initial stage of item-model fit analysis, the decision of
removing misfitting items with MNSQ values larger than 1.4
for further analysis was made, as these underfitting items
introduced an undesired amount of unpredictable random-
ness in the data and could not provide sufficiently meaning-
fulinformation.Threeitemswereidentifiedtobeunderfitting:
Item 1, Item 19, and Item 21. The detailed description of
each misfitting item is presented in Table 2.
For the analysis to be more "Rasch-compliant" (Wright &
Linacre, 1994, p. 370), the three misfitting items were tem-
porarily removed from the SRClang Scale, leaving 24 items
for analysis. The remaining items were refit to the model to
investigate whether their MNSQ values fell in the range of
0.6 and 1.4. This time, Items 17, 20, and 27 were found to be
misfitting in the refit SRClang model; therefore, they were
taken out from the SRClang Scale, leaving 21 items in the
final version of the scale for subsequent analyses. Table 3
shows the descriptions of the misfitting items in the second
refit model, and Table 4 presents the item-model fit statistics
and the item descriptions of the remaining items.
The refit item-model fit statistics as shown in Table 4
indicate that, after removing the misfitting items, the MNSQ
values of all of the remaining items were in the acceptable
range of 0.6 and 1.4. The mean of the infit MNSQ value of
the SRClang model is 1.00 (SD = 0.19) and that of the outfit
MNSQ value is 1.01 (SD = 0.19), suggesting that in general,
the items in the scale fit the model well.
Liu and Lee 5
Response Category Use
The SRClang Scale used a 4-point Likert-type scale. To deter-
mine whether the categories (i.e., disagree, slightly disagree,
slightly agree, agree) were used as intended, diagnostics of the
use of the rating scale response categories were performed.
The properties of the response categories of the SRClang
scale are presented in Table 5. The frequencies in all category
responses exceeded the recommended minimum number of
10 (Linacre, 1999, 2005a). As expected, the average mea-
sures and the threshold estimates both increased with the cat-
egories, indicating that they were functioning properly. Both
infit and outfit MNSQ statistics for each category were
between 0.8 and 1.2 (less than 2.0), suggesting that the cate-
gories provided adequate information rather than noise that
would have brought misinterpretation (Linacre, 1999).
Figure 1 shows the category probability curve, illustrating
the probability of responding to a specific category given the
differences in estimates between person trait scores and item
difficulties. The threshold corresponds to the intersected
points where one category probability curve meets the one
for the adjacent category. The hill-shaped category probabil-
ity curves show that all categories were used as intended.
Appropriateness of Item Difficulty Level for
Sample
The map of persons and items for the SRClang Scale is
shown in Figure 2. Both item difficulty level and person
latent trait level are arranged from the highest to the lowest.
That is, respondents with higher levels of self-regulatory
capacity as well as items measuring more demanding behav-
iors of self-regulation are at the top of the map, whereas
respondents with lower levels of self-regulatory capacity and
items measuring less demanding behaviors of self-regulation
are at the bottom of the map.
Generally speaking, Figure 2 shows that the range of item
difficulties appears to overlap with the person's range of
latent trait scores, suggesting that the items in the SRClang
Scale were able to measure respondents with varying levels
of self-regulatory capacity. Therefore, the difficulty levels of
the items were mostly appropriate for the sample, and the
scale was able to provide meaningful information to distin-
guish respondents with different levels of self-regulatory
capacity. It should be noted, however, that there were a num-
ber of respondents whose trait levels were much higher or
lower than any of the items could measure. The item that
demands the most self-regulatory capacity, Item 11 ("When
it comes to learning English, I have my special techniques to
prevent procrastination"), has a difficulty value of 0.63; and
the item that demands the least self-regulatory capacity, Item
3 ("When I am studying English and the learning environ-
ment becomes unsuitable, I try to sort out the problem"), has
a difficulty value of -0.54. However, excluding the extreme
data, the person with the highest self-regulatory capacity has
an estimated ability level at 3.34 and the lowest at -3.39. The
differences of the maximum and minimum values between
person trait scores and item difficulties indicate that the
SRClang Scale may not be able to provide sufficient infor-
mation for persons at the higher and lower ends of the self-
regulation continuum. In addition, several items (Items 2, 8,
9, 15, 16, 23, and 26) seem to function similarly in measuring
the same level of person latent trait.

expected to fall between 0 and 1, with .8 being the generally
acceptable threshold. Person separation reliability estimate
for the SRClang Scale was .93, indicating that the SRClang
Scale can adequately differentiate individuals. The value of
item separation reliability was observed to be .97, suggesting
that the separation of item difficulty is highly reliable.
The separation indices for both persons and items were
greater than the 2.00 threshold, with person separation index
being 3.68 and item separation index being 6.16. These val-
ues suggest adequate separation between persons as well as
between items on the SRClang Scale.

(i.e., removing three misfitting items twice), the PCA results
of the original scale as well as each of the revised scales were
reported to show that there were no noteworthy changes in
dimensionality with the removal of the misfitting items.
Table 7 provides the summary of PCA statistics of the origi-
nal and the revised SRClang scales.
As shown in Table 7, the variance of the SRClang Scale
explained by Rasch model fell below the desired 60%, and this
result was consistent across the original and the modified
scales. The empirical evidence appears to suggest that remov-
ing the misfitting items did not significantly affect the dimen-
sionality of the scale. Because the unidimensionality of the
scale could not be determined by the first factor Eigenvalue,
the PCA statistics of the unexplained variance were investi-
gated. In the second revision of the scale where six misfitting
items were excluded from the analysis, the first contrast of the
unexplained variance had an Eigenvalue of 2.3, which is
greater than the 1.5 cutoff point proposed by Smith (2002). To
be more specific, the unexplained variance in the first contrast
consisted of an amount that is equivalent to the weight of two
to three items and accounted for 6.2% of the unmodeled data.
Because the Eigenvalue of the first contrast was close to 3.0
and accounted for slightly over 5% of the variance, there was
no sufficient empirical evidence to support the unidimension-
ality of the SRClang Scale. Figure 3 illustrates the PCAresults
of the final revision of the SRClang Scale. The horizontal axis
(x-axis) is the Rasch dimension showing the difficulty of the
items; the vertical axis (y-axis) is the factor loadings on the
contrast (i.e., unexplained variance). Items with a substantial
amount of unexplained variance have higher factor loadings,
and thus appear on the top of the y-axis. Bond and Fox (2007)
suggested that a secondary dimension may exist when the
items are clustered in a clear pattern. From Figure 3, two items
appear to be substantially positively correlated with the first
contrast (loadings > 0.60): Item 11 (Metacognition Control)
and Item 10 (Commitment Control). Another two items have
substantial negative loadings with the factor: Item 23 (Emotion
Control) and Item 25 (Emotion Control). This indicates that,
while a secondary dimension of the SRClang Scale may exist
based on PCA of Rasch residuals, its robustness and nature
need further investigation.
Discussion and Conclusion
The main purpose of this study was to investigate the psycho-
metric properties of the SRClang Scale and to further exam-
ine the unidimensionality of self-regulation in second
language learning via Rasch measurement. Specifically, the
RSM was used to examine the adequacy of response category
use, appropriateness of item difficulty level for the sample,
reliability of person and item separation, and dimensionality.
The initial item-model fit analysis revealed several misfit-
ting items that were unable to provide meaningful informa-
tion for the model. For the purpose of maintaining the
precision of the results, the misfitting items--Items 1, 17, 19,
20, 21, and 27--were excluded from the scale in the subse-
quent analyses.
When taking a closer look at the descriptions of the mis-
fitting items, it is observed that the items do not belong to
any specific action control taxonomy. To elaborate, each of
the five action and volition controls has at least one misfit-
ting item, suggesting that the performance of the items was
not particularly affected by any specific control. However, it
should be noted that, out of the six misfitting items, five of
them describe negative learning behaviors: being impatient,
being upset, giving up halfway, procrastinating, and being
distracted. Although additional empirical data need to be col-
lected for confirmation, it is highly possible that the

negatively phrased statements do not express the intention of
the descriptors well. In addition, researchers have started to
recommend that social science questionnaires avoid the use
of negative wording due to the fact that respondents tend to
disagree with items that describe negative behaviors to be in
accordance with social desire or preference (J. E. Purpura,
personal communication, October 15, 2014). To make a jus-
tifiable claim of the elimination of the misfitting items from
the scale, further research is needed to determine whether the
misfit is caused by wording or by other construct-irrelevant
variables. A plausible approach is to reword all negatively
phrased descriptors into their positively phrased equivalence,

and then reexamine whether the items in the revised SRClang
Scale can well represent the underlying traits of each action
and volitional control.
The results of the persons and items map indicate that
there were respondents who demonstrated both higher and
lower levels of self-regulatory capacity (person latent trait)
than the items were able to measure. In the SRClang Scale,
the item that describes the most demanding self-regulatory
capacity in second language learning (Item 11) is related to
learners' metacognition control, whereas the item that
describes the least demanding self-regulatory capacity (Item
3) belongs to learners' environment control. However, the
scale in general shows no clear pattern regarding the corre-
spondence between the items' difficulty levels and their con-
trol taxonomy; therefore, the nature of what makes one
self-regulation behavior more demanding than another can-
not be determined at this point. In addition, several items
seem to be functioning in a similar manner, thus serving as
repetitive measures. For example, the map shows that Items
2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 23, and 26 all measure the same person trait
level, and among them, Items 8, 15, and 16 are three of the
four items that describe satiation control. In other words,
Items 8, 15, and 16 are likely to function so similarly that
little new information could be extracted from individual
items. While the current items in the SRClang Scale can
appropriately differentiate learners with various levels of
self-regulatory capacity, items that can measure person
ability trait at both the higher and lower ends of the self-
regulatory capacity continuum are needed to fulfill construct
representation. Furthermore, items that function similarly
should be reexamined and reduced if necessary, so that the
scale can be more concise.
Liu (2009) employed exploratory factor analysis to examine
the SRClang Scale, and the factor loadings indicated that self-
regulation in second language learning appeared to answer to
one single factor. However, the dimensionality analysis through
Rasch measurement in the present study was unable to support
Liu's previous finding. The variance of the first factor in the
scale did not reach the suggested 60% for the scale to be con-
sidered unidimensional. Furthermore, the unexplained vari-
ance of the first contrast accounted for slightly over 5% with an
Eigenvalue of 2.3, indicating that there might be a second
dimension in the model. The Rasch-residual analysis also iden-
tified four items with considerably high correlations--two
positively, two negatively--with the potential second dimen-
sion. Although not all four items are under the same control
taxonomy, the items seem to share a common trait of describ-
ing learners'ability to perform strategic actions:
Item 10: When learning English, I persist until I reach the
goals that I make for myself.
Item 11: When it comes to learning English, I have my
special technique to prevent procrastination.
Item 23: When I feel stressed about learning English, I
know how to handle the stress.
Item 25: When learning English, I know how to manage
my personal emotions to make the learning efficient.
It is possible that learners' ability to manage their own
learning behaviors with strategies constitutes a second
dimension of self-regulation. While such an explanation is
potentially reasonable, it still needs further investigation.
Both theoretical foundation and empirical evidence are
required to fully understand the nature of the potential
second dimension in self-regulation in second language
learning.
Even though the underlying construct of self-regulation in
second language learning as measured by the SRClang Scale
may not be unidimensional, the dimensionality analysis in
the present study only detected a possible second dimension.
Such a finding suggests that the five action and volitional
controls as originally conceptualized in the SRCvoc Scale
(Tseng et al., 2006) may not all contribute to self-regulatory
capacity in second language learning. In fact, a similar claim
has been empirically supported by Mizumoto and Takeuchi's
(2012) replication study. In their study, Mizumoto and
Takeuchi adapted Tseng et al.'s (2006) SRCvoc Scale and
applied it to a Japanese EFL setting (i.e., Japanese students
learning English as a foreign language). They found that
while the SRCvoc Scale can serve as a reliable measure of
self-regulatory capacity in vocabulary learning in a Japanese
context, the underlying traits of self-regulation only
accounted for three controls (emotion, metacognition, and
environment), as opposed to the five controls proposed by
Tseng et al. While Mizumoto and Takeuchi (2012) attributed
the differences in the dimensions of self-regulation to "cul-
tural differences or item parceling" (p. 90), it is likely that the
underlying traits of self-regulation are more parsimonious
than initially proposed. However, because Mizumoto and
Takeuchi only focused on vocabulary learning instead of lan-
guage learning in general, its generalizability might be
restricted when it comes to determining whether there indeed
exists a second dimension in the SRClang Scale, and if so,
what the exact nature of self-regulation in second language
learning is. Meanwhile, the SRClang Scale still demonstrates
proper response category use, high reliability in item and
person separation, as well as appropriate item difficulty level
for the sample; therefore, it can be considered an adequate
instrument.

While the present study provides further insight into the
psychometric properties of self-regulation, the dimensional-
ity of self-regulation remains a pending question. Based on
the results of the present study, the unidimensionality of self-
regulation indeed cannot be established. Nonetheless, the
analyzed scale underwent several modifications, and word-
ing in the scale descriptors has been identified early in the
analysis process as a potential construct-irrelevant variable.
In addition, although not conventionally recommended by
Rasch analysts, the analysis did not compare models that dif-
fered in their dimensionality specifications. Therefore, a
more complete investigation of the data would reveal whether
a unidimensional model works better than a theory-informed,
multidimensional one.
The study also carries several other limitations. As seen
from the results, the SRClang Scale was unable to suffi-
ciently measure learners with either higher or lower levels
of self-regulatory capacity. In addition, the participants were
rather homogeneous in terms of their background, resulting
in the evidence being limited to this particular sample of
second language learners. Based on the limitations of the
present study, two directions for future research are pro-
posed: First, there is a need to determine, from a theoretical
perspective, what traits constitute more (or less) demanding
self-regulation behaviors and add items accordingly to the
current scale to provide more useful diagnostics for learners
with extremely high or low levels of self-regulatory capac-
ity. Second, participants with more diverse backgrounds
should be recruited, so that the results can be more valid and
more generalizable.
In conclusion, the SRClang Scale at its current state
serves as an appropriate scale to provide diagnostic infor-
mation for second language learners regarding their self-
regulatory capacity in English learning. Second language
teachers may use the information to provide proper assis-
tance to students based on their self-regulatory capacity and
their needs. For second language learners who wish to
achieve a certain outcome by learning on their own, having
a better understanding of their own self-regulatory capacity
can help them monitor and evaluate their learning progress.
It is also hoped that the present study contributes to the cur-
rent understanding of the role self-regulation plays in sec-
ond language learning.
