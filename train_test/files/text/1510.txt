Longitudinal Associations Between Alcohol Problems
and Depressive Symptoms: Early Adolescence Through
Early Adulthood
Naomi R. Marmorstein
Background: Alcohol use-related problems and depressive symptoms are clearly associated with
each other, but results regarding the nature of this association have been inconsistent. In addition,
the possible moderating effects of age and gender have not been comprehensively examined. The
goals of this study were to clarify: (i) how depressive symptoms affect the levels and trajectory of
alcohol use-related problems, (ii) how alcohol use-related problems affect the levels and trajectory
of depressive symptoms, and (iii) whether there are differences in these associations at different
points in development or between males and females.
Methods: Participants for this study were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health (AddHealth) data set, a community-based sample of 20,728 adolescents fol-
lowed from adolescence through early adulthood. Multilevel models were used to assess how each
problem affected the level and rate of change in the other problem over time; gender was consid-
ered as a possible moderator of these associations.
Results: The results indicated that alcohol use-related problems and depressive symptoms had
reciprocal, positive associations with each other during the period from early adolescence through
early adulthood; however, these effects differed somewhat by gender and age. High levels of
depressive symptoms were associated with higher initial levels of alcohol problems (particularly
among females), as well as faster increases in alcohol problems over time among males. High lev-
els of alcohol problems were associated with higher initial levels of depressive symptoms (particu-
larly among females), as well as less curvature in the slope of depressive symptoms so that
although there was a large difference between people with high and low depressive symptoms in
early adolescence, by early adulthood the difference was smaller (particularly among females).
Conclusions: These results highlight the importance of examining gender and age in studies on
the associations between affective disorders and substance use disorders.

F OR DECADES, THEORISTS and researchers have
discussed associations between depression and alcohol
use disorders (e.g., Zucker, 1986) and recent commentaries
have noted the need for research on the relation between alco-
hol use disorders and mood disorders (e.g., Li et al., 2004).
However, the results of empirical studies on the nature of this
association have been inconsistent. These inconsistencies may
be due, in part, to the fact that different studies use samples
that vary in their gender and age composition. This study
examined the longitudinal associations between alcohol prob-
lems and depressive symptoms in a community-based sample
of youth. By using an analytic approach that examined
within-person trajectories of change over time (i.e., how levels
of 1 problem predicted both level and rate of change of the
other problem) it provides a unique angle on these associa-
tions across the period from early adolescence through early
adulthood. It also adds to the existing literature by reporting
cross-sectional correlations between continuous measures
of depressive symptoms and alcohol use-related problems
from early adolescence through early adulthood in a single
community-based sample.
Previous Research on Alcohol Problems and Depression
Major depressive disorder (MDD) has long been linked to
alcohol use disorders [here, these disorders are considered
together with depressive symptoms and alcohol use-related
problems due to evidence that levels of these symptoms fall
on a continuum in the population (e.g., Hankin et al., 2005;
Hasin et al., 2006)]. These 2 problems have been discussed
together for theoretical reasons, with the concept of ``negative
affect alcoholism'' dating back several decades (see Zucker,
1986 for a discussion of this). Alcohol (or other substances)
may be used by people with depressive feelings to help them
cope (``self-medication''); substance use may be especially
reinforcing for depressed people because it can decrease

negative feelings. In turn, alcohol problems may predispose
people to depression, either through physiological effects of
heavy substance use or because the consequences of problem
use (e.g., family problems, school or work problems) may be
depressing. Alternatively, both depression and alcohol prob-
lems may be different expressions of an underlying risk factor
(such as difficulty with emotion regulation, poor family rela-
tionships, etc.), a shared comorbid condition, or a shared
genetic diathesis (Nurnberger et al., 2002). Evidence has sup-
ported both models that emphasize the likelihood that alcohol
problems and depression act as risk factors for each other (see
Swendsen and Merikangas, 2000 for a review) and models
that support the potential shared neurobiological underpin-
nings of these problems (Rao, 2006).
Evidence is conflicting regarding the temporal association
between depression and alcohol problems. Some studies have
found that depression predicts alcohol problems (e.g., Abra-
ham and Fava, 1999), whereas others have found that alcohol
problems (or substance problems in general--including illicit
drug-related problems) predict depression (e.g., Bovasso,
2001; Bukstein et al., 1992; Rao et al., 2000; Rohde et al.,
2001; Stice et al., 2004). Furthermore, a number of studies
have found a reciprocal association: that depressive disorders
predict substance problems and substance problems predict
depression (e.g., Clark et al., 1997; Deykin et al., 1992;
Hettema et al., 2003; Swendsen et al., 1998). However, it is
important to note that for each of these patterns, there are
also negative findings--findings that 1 problem does not
predict the other over time.
There are several potential factors that could account for
these discrepant findings. First, these associations may differ
by age. Among studies that include frequent assessments,
there is some indication of more reciprocal prediction (depres-
sion predicting substance abuse and the reverse) in early to
mid-adolescence (Stice et al., 2004; in univariate analyses pre-
dicting the onset of each problem by the other problem) than
in late adolescence to early adulthood (Rao et al., 2000). Sev-
eral other studies are consistent with the notion of closer asso-
ciations between these problems among younger people: (1) a
retrospective study indicated that adolescent-onset substance
use disorders (SUD--abuse and dependence) may be more
strongly related to depression than adult-onset SUD (Clark
et al., 1998); (2) a prospective study found that persistent
internalizing problems predicted persistent substance use in
preadolescence, but the same was not true during adolescence
(Loeber et al., 1999); and (3) in the same sample, the level of
depression among 13-year-olds was associated with concur-
rent level of alcohol use but did not predict change in alcohol
use over time (White et al., 2001). It is not clear whether the
possible closer associations between SUD and depression
among younger people are related to aspects of the disorders
or developmental periods themselves or whether early-onset
cases represent more severe variants, which would make it
more likely that people with early-onset cases had either par-
ticularly strong genetic predispositions (to both problems or
to a neurobiological factor that increased risk for both prob-
lems, such as difficulties with emotion regulation) or particu-
larly noxious environments (e.g., severe abuse; Clark et al.,
2003). Adolescent-onset depression does predict risk for later
depression and impaired functioning (Weissman et al., 1999)
and early-onset binge drinking does predict later alcohol
abuse and dependence (Chassin et al., 2002), although
whether these increased risks carry over to increased risk for
other problems remains an open question.
Second, these associations may differ by gender. Several
studies have found that the link between depression and sub-
stance problems is stronger in females than males (Bukstein
et al., 1992; Clark et al., 1997; Deykin et al., 1992). However,
some contradictory evidence exists (Costello et al., 1999;
Henry et al., 1993), and several studies have found that associ-
ations between depression and substance problems are similar
for males and females (e.g., Hettema et al., 2003; Marmor-
stein and Iacono, 2003; Rohde et al., 2001). Among longitudi-
nal studies, no clear pattern has emerged, although it is
possible that SUD may more commonly precede MDD in
males, while MDD may be equally likely to precede or follow
SUD in females (Clark et al., 1997; Hettema et al., 2003).
Third, these associations may differ by type of substance
(alcohol vs. illicit drugs), although there is limited evidence to
support this notion. Of the prospective studies discussed
above, the 1 that examined adolescent alcohol use disorders
found that they predicted later MDD (Rohde et al., 2001);
similarly, the one that focused on drug use disorders found
that cannabis abuse predicted later depression among adults
(Bovasso, 2001). Retrospective studies do not indicate any
clear difference in patterns between alcohol and illicit drugs
(e.g., Abraham and Fava, 1999; Clark et al., 1997; Hettema
et al., 2003; Swendsen et al., 1998), however, there is very little
evidence to conclusively state whether these associations differ
by type of substance.
Fourth, there may be a difference in associations between
depression and substance problems when diagnoses versus
symptoms are considered. However, no clear pattern based on
this distinction emerges in the literature to date. When SUD
and depressive diagnoses are considered, some evidence
points to SUD predicting depressive disorders (Bukstein
et al., 1992; Hettema et al., 2003; Rao et al., 2000; Rohde
et al., 2001; but see Abraham and Fava, 1999), although there
is also evidence of reciprocal prediction (Clark et al., 1997;
Deykin et al., 1992; Swendsen et al., 1998). Fewer studies have
examined depressive and substance-related symptoms, but the
evidence from those also tends to point to substance-related
symptoms predicting depressive symptoms [Bovasso, 2001;
Stice et al., 2004 (which examined substance-related symp-
toms as predictors of the onset of depressive pathology)]. This
similar pattern of results is not surprising, given that depres-
sion and substance-related problems occur on continua in the
population (Hankin et al., 2005; Hasin et al., 2006).
Fifth, these associations may differ based on whether the
samples were recruited from clinics or from the community.
However, no clear pattern based on sample origin emerges.
Clinic samples have yielded results indicating that depression

predicts alcohol problems (Abraham and Fava, 1999), that
substance problems predicts depression (Bukstein et al.,
1992), and that there is a reciprocal association between the 2
problems (Clark et al., 1997; Deykin et al., 1992). Community
samples have yielded results indicating that substance prob-
lems predicts depression (Bovasso, 2001; Rao et al., 2000;
Rohde et al., 2001; Stice et al., 2004) and that there is a reci-
procal relation between the 2 problems (Hettema et al., 2003;
Swendsen et al., 1998). The lack of community-based studies
finding unidirectional effects from depression to substance
problems may not reflect a true lack of effect, although, since
multiple community-based studies have found reciprocal
relations between the 2 problems.
Current Study
The goals of this study were to clarify: (1) how depressive
symptoms predict the levels and trajectory of alcohol use-
related problems, (2) how alcohol use-related problems pre-
dict the levels and trajectory of depressive symptoms, and (3)
whether there are differences in these associations at different
points in development or between males and females. The
period from early adolescence through early adulthood was
considered, and a community-based sample of youth was
used to avoid the biases associated with treatment-seeking
populations.
A multilevel modeling approach was used. Simple variable-
centered prospective analyses, in which a variable at 1 point
in time is used to predict another variable at a later point in
time, have traditionally been used but are limited in several
ways. For example, only 2 assessment points can be exam-
ined. Also, if the sample is a single uniform age, these studies
can only tell us about the relation between the variables at the
2 assessment ages; if the sample includes youth of different
ages, important developmental differences may be masked.
Thus, for developmentally focused research, multilevel model-
ing has significant advantages. This approach first determines
typical trajectories of each type of problem over this time per-
iod, then examines how each problem relates to increases or
decreases in the level and rate of change of the other problem
within individuals. Potential gender differences were assessed
by entering gender into the model as another possible predic-
tor of trajectories. By examining the shape of these trajecto-
ries over time and the effects of each problem on the slope of
the trajectories, the possibility that these associations differed
at different ages/developmental stages was examined.
Hypotheses were developed based on both theoretical rea-
sons (the self-medication model of substance abuse and the
possibility that heavy substance use may cause physiological
and/or psychosocial consequences that increase risk for
depression) and empirical evidence supporting reciprocal
pathways between depression and alcohol problems. Overall,
it was expected that higher levels of depressive symptoms
would be associated with both higher levels of alcohol use-
related problems and faster increases in alcohol use-related
problems over time. Reciprocally, it was expected that higher
levels of alcohol use-related problems would relate to both
higher levels of depressive symptoms and faster increases in
depressive symptoms over time. It was tentatively expected
that, if gender differences were found, associations between
the 2 problems would be stronger for females, compared with
males. It was also expected that, if developmental differences
were found, the reciprocal effects of these problems would be
stronger among younger, compared with older, youth.
In addition to these analyses addressing the effect of each
problem on the trajectory of the other problem, we also
report cross-sectional correlations between these problems at
each age, by gender. These analyses allow for an examination
of developmental trends in the concurrent associations
between alcohol use-related problems and depressive
symptoms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Participants for this study were drawn from the restricted-use con-
tractual data set of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (AddHealth) data set (Udry, 2003). The Rutgers University
Institutional Review Board approved the data analysis project pre-
sented here. At wave 1 (1994 to 1995), the AddHealth team collected
a stratified, random sample of students from high schools in the Uni-
ted States; the high schools were stratified into clusters based on
region, urbanicity, size of school, type of school, percentage of school
that was white, percentage of school that was black, span of grades
included in the school, and type of curriculum the school offered.
Participating high schools then identified middle schools or junior
high schools that contributed at least 5 students to the entering class
of the high school; students from 1 feeder school per high school were
selected for inclusion in this study. Students from 145 middle, junior
high, and high schools participated in this initial phase of data collec-
tion. Next, in-home interviews were completed with a core sample
from each community as well as participants from some ``saturated
schools'' (schools in which all students were included in the in-home
sample) and over-samples of some special populations (adolescents
with limb disabilities, black participants from well-educated families,
Chinese, Cuban, and Puerto Rican adolescents, and adolescents
residing with other genetically related or nonrelated adolescents in
the sample). Mothers of these in-home interview participants were
also interviewed. All students (n = 20,728) were in grades 7 to 12
during the 1994 to 1995 school year when these data were collected
[age range = 11 to 21; a total of 80 (0.38%) students were 20 or 21
at this assessment and were most likely receiving special education
services or were learning English as a second language]. Approxi-
mately 1 year later (1996), in-home follow-up interviews (wave 2)
were conducted with 71% (n = 14,738) of these adolescents (age
range = 11 to 23); adolescents who were no longer in high school
(i.e., participants who were in 12th grade at wave 1) were not
followed-up at this time. Approximately 6 years after the initial
assessment (2001 to 2002), the original participants were located and
invited to participate in in-home interviews again (wave 3); 73% of
the wave 1 sample (n = 15,197) did so (age range 18 to 28). Addi-
tional information regarding the design of this study can be found in
Harris et al. (2003).
At wave 1, participants in this study were a mean age of 15.66
(SD = 1.75). At waves 2 and 3, they averaged 16.22 (SD = 1.65)
and 21.96 (SD = 1.77) years old, respectively. At wave 1, 23% were
African-American, 8% were Asian-American or Pacific Islander, 4%
were Native American, and 61% were Caucasian. In addition, 17%
were Hispanic or Latino. About 82% of mothers had graduated
ALCOHOL USE-RELATED PROBLEMS AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS 51
from high school or gotten their GED, and 23% of mothers had
graduated from college by the time of the wave 1 assessment. Moth-
ers reported that 9.7% of families were receiving some form of public
assistance (such as welfare).
Overall response rates were 78.9% at wave 1, 88.2% at wave 2,
and 77.4% at wave 3. To assess for the possibility of differential attri-
tion, participants who completed both the wave 1 and wave 3 assess-
ments were compared with participants who completed the wave 1
assessment only on levels of depressive symptoms and alcohol prob-
lems (wave 2 was not included in this analysis since participants who
had graduated from high school between wave 1 and wave 2 were
intentionally not assessed at wave 2). There were no differences in
levels of wave 1 depressive symptoms between these groups
(t = )0.98, p > 0.05). Wave 3 nonparticipants had slightly higher
mean levels of alcohol problems at wave 1 (t = )3.52, p < 0.001),
but this effect seemed to be related to the higher levels of wave 3 non-
response among older participants (who were more likely to have
had alcohol problems at wave 1, due to being in late, as opposed to
early, adolescence). Specifically, mean levels of wave 1 alcohol prob-
lems among participants who did and did not participate at wave 3
were similar when participants of similar ages were examined [e.g.,
when wave 3 participants and nonparticipants who were 12 to 13
and 17 to 18 at wave 1 were compared separately, there were no dif-
ferences in alcohol problems between the groups (t = )1.44,
p > 0.05 and t = )1.17, p > 0.05, respectively)].
Measures
Depressive Symptoms. Nine depression-related questions, drawn
from the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale
(CES-D; Radloff, 1977), were asked of participants at all 3 assess-
ments. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale (never/rarely, some-
times, a lot of the time, most of the time/all of the time), resulting in
a scale ranging from 0 to 27 (actual maximum score = 27). The par-
ticipants were instructed to report on symptoms they may have had
during the past week. The mean total score (across all waves and
ages) was 5.55 (SD = 4.26); among people who had used alcohol at
least 2 to 3 times, the mean score was 5.75 (SD = 4.38). Standard-
ized Cronbach's alpha coefficients for this scale ranged from 0.80 at
the first assessment to 0.81 at the third assessment. Although this was
a shorter scale than that used at waves 1 and 2 and previously shown
to have considerable validity (e.g., Rende et al., 2006; Steuber and
Banner, 2006), it correlated highly with the longer scale that was
administered at waves 1 and 2 (r = 0.95 at wave 1, r = 0.96 at wave
2). The CES-D has been shown to be strongly associated with diag-
noses of major depression in other community-based samples of
adolescents (e.g., Prescott et al., 1998).
Alcohol Use-Related Problems. Seven questions regarding
alcohol use-related problems were asked of participants at all 3
assessments. Each asked about the participant's frequency during
the past 12 months of experiencing various types of problems that
may occur as a result of alcohol use (e.g., ``...you've had prob-
lems at school or with school work because you had been drink-
ing''; ``...you had problems with your friends because you had
been drinking''). All items were either developmentally appropriate
at all ages (e.g., gotten into a physical fight due to drinking) or
were modified to be developmentally appropriate (e.g., the item
above relating to problems with school or school work was chan-
ged at wave 3 to reflect problems with school or work). Each
item was rated on a 5-point scale (ranging from ``never'' to ``5 or
more times''), resulting in a scale ranging from 0 to 35 (actual
maximum score = 28). The mean score (across all waves and
ages) was 1.47 (SD = 2.95; median = 0.00); among people who
had used alcohol at least 2 to 3 times, the mean score was 2.82
(SD = 3.57; median = 2.00). Standardized Cronbach's alpha
coefficients for this scale ranged from 0.74 at the first assessment
to 0.76 at the third assessment. Scores on this measure were log-
transformed due to skew.
Gender. The biological sex of each participant was recorded
when demographic information was collected during the first assess-
ment. Males were coded zero and females were coded 1.
Age. The age of each participant was recorded at the time of
each assessment.
Statistical Analyses
Prior to analyses being conducted, each participant's score on each
measure at each assessment wave was converted to a score at each
age he or she was assessed. This resulted in a data structure in which
each participant contributed data at his or her set of 3 ages (e.g., ages
12, 13, and 18 for 1 participant; ages 17, 18, and 23 for another).
First, means and standard deviations for depressive symptoms and
alcohol use-related problems were computed for participants at each
age. Then, cross-sectional Pearson correlations between these prob-
lems were computed for males and females separately at each age.
Multilevel models for predicting change were used to investigate
the effect of depressive symptoms on alcohol use problem trajecto-
ries over time and the effect of alcohol use problems on depressive
trajectories over time. This method is functionally the same as
growth curve modeling or mixed effects models (e.g., Singer, 1998).
Models were estimated using PROC MIXED in the Statistical
Analysis System (SAS) version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
Full information maximum likelihood estimation (ML) was used
to compare directly the fit of nested models to the data and to use
all available data, given the presence of missing observations,
which were treated as missing at random (Singer and Willett,
2003). Both the likelihood ratio test (LRT; comparing the )2 log
likelihood of nested models) and the Bayesian Information Crite-
rion (BIC) were used to assess model fit (Singer and Willett, 2003).
First, unconditional growth models for alcohol use-related prob-
lems (dependent variable) were estimated and investigated to examine
whether a linear or quadratic model best fit the data. Then, the
potential influence of gender on alcohol problems was investigated
by entering gender as a time-invariant predictor. Next, depressive
symptoms at each time point (a time-varying predictor) were added
to the model to examine whether depressive symptoms, alone or in
combination with gender, affected the trajectory of alcohol problems
over time. The final model was determined by examining both the
pattern of significance of the predictors and the fit statistics of the
models.
Next, analogous models were estimated using depressive symp-
toms as the dependent variable and age, gender, and alcohol use-
related problems as predictor variables. Briefly, models including: (1)
a linear slope, (2) a quadratic slope, (3) slope terms plus gender, and
(4) slope terms, gender, and alcohol problems were examined.
Initially, participants who reported not having a drink of alcohol
>2 or 3 times in their lives and never drinking outside the family
were assigned a score of 0 on the measure of alcohol problems. After
these primary analyses, all analyses were re-run including only partic-
ipants who reported having had alcohol at least 2 to 3 times in their
lives to examine whether the associations were similar in the entire
sample and in the subsample of alcohol users.
These analyses resulted in models in which main effects of each
predictor reflected the influence of the predictor on the initial level
of the dependent variable, while the interaction effects of the pre-
dictors with the slope terms indicated how, at each age, the predic-
tor variable deflected the individual's score on the dependent
variable off of the typical developmental trajectory. In models of
this type, if the association between these problems remained the
same at different ages, that would be indicated by a nonsignificant
interaction between the independent variable (alcohol problems or
52 MARMORSTEIN
depression) and the term(s) in the equation that represented slope
(linear and/or quadratic). In contrast, a significant interaction
between the independent variable and slope term(s) would indicate
that the effect of the predictor varied at different points in develop-
ment. The intercepts and slopes are estimated independently, so
while earlier levels of the dependent variable are not statistically
``controlled for,'' the estimate of initial values is separated from the
estimate of change over time.
RESULTS
Descriptive Statistics
Means and standard deviations for depressive symptoms
and alcohol use-related problems are presented in Table 1.
Depressive symptoms peaked at age 17 and alcohol problems
peaked at age 22.
Pearson correlation coefficients representing the cross-
sectional associations between depressive symptoms and
alcohol use-related problems are also presented in Table 1.
Inspection of these values indicates that for males, there
tended to be a curvilinear pattern of these correlation coeffi-
cients, with them tending to be fairly low in early adolescence
and the mid-20s and higher in between (with a peak at age
16). In contrast, in females, these correlation coefficients were
highest in early adolescence and then tended to decrease over
time. These patterns indicate that (1) the cross-sectional asso-
ciations between depressive symptoms and alcohol problems
changed with age, and (2) these associations showed different
patterns in males and females. Therefore, we next examined
the influence of each problem on the trajectory of the other
problem over time, considering gender as a possible modera-
tor of these associations.
Trajectories of Alcohol Use-Related Problems
Parameter estimates, along with standard errors, the signifi-
cance levels of t-values associated with each parameter esti-
mate, and fit statistics for all models, are presented in Table 2.
Unconditional Growth Model. First, a linear growth
model was fit to the data. As expected, it indicated that alco-
hol problems tended to increase with increasing age (linear
slope = 0.0310). A quadratic model provided a significantly
better fit to the data than the linear model (LRT: differ-
ence = 2461.7, df = 4, p < 0.001). Therefore, the quadratic
model was retained for future analyses. The negative value of
the quadratic term indicated that with each squared value of
age, the rate of change in the slope slowed, resulting in a slope
that increased more steeply in adolescence and less steeply in
early adulthood.
Model Including Gender as a Predictor. Next, gender
was entered as a time-invariant predictor. The model includ-
ing gender fit the data significantly better than the uncondi-
tional growth model (LRT: difference = 280.0, df = 4,
p < 0.001). Parameter estimates indicated that although
females had slightly higher initial levels of alcohol problems,
males experienced a steeper increase in alcohol problems over
time than females did.
Model Including Depressive Symptoms and Gender as
Predictors (Full Model). Next, depressive symptoms were
added to the model as a time-varying predictor. The model
including gender along with depressive symptoms fit the data
significantly better than the model including only gender as a

aThese sample sizes refer to participants who provided data on both depressive symptoms and alcohol use-related problems.
bMeans and standard deviations for alcohol use-related problems were derived from raw data; correlations with depressive symptoms were
calculated using log-transformed alcohol problem variables. Mean numbers of depressive symptoms differed (p < 0.05) between males and
females at all ages except age 26. Mean numbers of alcohol problems differed (p < 0.05) between males and females at all ages except 12, 16,
and 26. Correlations between depressive symptoms and alcohol problems differed (p < 0.05) between males and females at ages 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 19, and 22 (but not at other ages).

predictor (LRT: difference = 704, df = 4, p < 0.001).
Examination of the parameter estimates indicated that
depressive symptoms were associated with higher initial levels
of alcohol problems, especially for females. There was also a
trend-level (p = 0.08) interaction effect of gender and depres-
sive symptoms on the linear slope such that males with higher
levels of depressive symptoms experienced more rapid (stee-
per) increases in their alcohol problems than did females.
Final Model. In an attempt to find a model that provided
a good fit to the data yet was parsimonious, first, all terms from
the full model that were not significant at the p < 0.05 level
were removed. However, this model provided a significantly
less-good fit to the data (LRT: difference = 261.5, df = 4,
p < 0.001). Therefore, all terms except those relating to the
quadratic slope were retained. This model provided a good fit
to the data (LRT: difference = 0.6, df = 4, p = 0.96, and
the BIC was smaller for this model, indicating a better fit).
This final model indicated that initial levels of depressive
symptoms were associated with higher initial levels of alcohol
problems, especially for females. However, males overall, and
especially males with high levels of depressive symptoms, had
a faster rate of growth in their alcohol-related problems, com-
pared with females or males with low levels of depression.
A prototypical plot of this model is depicted in Fig. 1. The
trajectories depicted in this figure represent model-predicted
trajectories for male and female participants with high (75th
percentile) and low (25th percentile) levels of depressive
symptoms.

estimate, and fit statistics for all models, are presented in

Unconditional Growth Model. First, a linear growth
model was fit to the data. It indicated that across the period
from early adolescence through early adulthood, depressive
symptoms tended to decrease slightly. A quadratic model pro-
vided a significantly better fit to the data than the linear
growth model (LRT: difference = 709.6, df = 4,
p < 0.001). Therefore, the quadratic model was retained for
future analyses.
Model Including Gender as a Predictor. Gender was
next entered as a time-invariant predictor. The model includ-
ing gender fit the data significantly better than the uncondi-
tional growth model (LRT: difference = 771.9, df = 4,
p < 0.001). Parameter estimates indicated that females had
higher initial levels of depressive symptoms.
Model Including Alcohol Use-Related Problems and Gen-
der as Predictors (Full Model). Next, alcohol problems
were added to the model as a time-varying predictor. The
model including gender along with alcohol problems fit the
data significantly better than the model including only gender
as a predictor (LRT: difference = 12,369.4, df = 4,
p < 0.001). Examination of the parameter estimates indi-
cated that early alcohol problems were associated with higher
initial levels of depressive symptoms, especially for females.
However, depressive symptoms increased most rapidly for
males with high levels of alcohol problems--that is, males
with high levels of alcohol problems were especially likely to
be increasing (or decreasing less than other participants) in
their depressive symptoms at any given point in time. In addi-
tion, alcohol problems were associated with less curvature in

for females. Thus, among participants with high levels of
alcohol problems, and especially females with high levels
of alcohol problems, the slope of depressive symptoms was
more linear than among other participants such that although
there was a large difference in depressive symptoms between
participants with high and low levels of alcohol problems in
early adolescence, by early adulthood the differences were
small and relatively consistent.

Models Including Only Participants Who Used Alcohol
When analogous analyses were conducted including only
participants who used alcohol, the results were quite similar.
For analyses using depressive symptoms to predict alcohol
problems, a final model using the same set of predictors was
ideal. For analyses using alcohol problems to predict depres-
sive symptoms, the quadratic terms were not significant;
therefore, the best-fitting model included only the intercept
and linear slope terms.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study indicate that alcohol use-related
problems and depressive symptoms have reciprocal, positive
associations with each other during the period from early
adolescence through early adulthood; however, these effects
differ somewhat by gender and age. Overall, higher levels of
depressive symptoms were associated with higher initial levels
of alcohol problems (particularly among females), as well as
faster increases in alcohol problems over time among males.
Reciprocally, high levels of alcohol problems were associated
with higher initial levels of depressive symptoms (particularly
among females); however, while the trajectory of depressive
symptoms among participants overall was curvilinear, high
levels of alcohol problems were associated with less curvature
in the slope of depressive symptoms over time (particularly
among females), so although there was a large effect of alco-
hol problems in early adolescence, that effect was smaller by
early adulthood.
Cross-sectional correlations between depressive symptoms
and alcohol problems at each age illustrate these trends in a
different way. These correlation coefficients showed a curvi-
linear pattern among males, being fairly low in early adoles-
cence and the mid-20s and higher in between. Among
females, these correlation coefficients were highest in early
adolescence and tended to decrease over time. These findings
complement the longitudinal findings summarized previously
by illustrating that in early adolescence, there were closer
associations between these 2 problems among females, while
later in development this was not the case.
There are many possible explanations for these longitudinal
associations between depressive symptoms and alcohol prob-
lems. As noted by Swendsen and Merikangas (2000), it is
likely that there are multiple pathways leading to comorbidity
between these problems, and the population of individuals
with both problems is probably quite heterogeneous. Some
support for a common genetic diathesis has been found (e.g.,
Kendler et al., 1993; Nurnberger et al., 2002; Preisig et al.,
2001; Prescott et al., 2000), although it is possible that any
apparent shared genetic risk may actually be due to the
genetic risk for antisocial personality disorder, which is fre-
quently comorbid with both depression and alcohol depen-
dence (Fu et al., 2002). Research integrating an examination

of antisocial behavior along with depression and alcohol
problems would be useful in teasing apart whether this joint
comorbidity accounts for the apparent association between
depression and alcohol problems. There are several ways in
which neurobiological factors may link these disorders, and
based on evidence from animal studies, substance use in ado-
lescence may have more effects on the brain than substance
use in adulthood (see Rao, 2006 for a review)--which could
result in more risk for depression stemming from heavy alco-
hol use in adolescence, compared with heavy alcohol use in
adulthood. Evidence also indicates that physical and sexual
abuse may predispose adolescents to both depression and
alcohol use disorders (Clark et al., 2003). In addition, it seems
likely that each disorder influences risk for the other, whether
because people sometimes drink heavily to cope with negative
feelings or because the problems that go along with having an
alcohol use disorder (e.g., social and occupational impair-
ment) also are stressors that can precipitate a depressive
episode.
The findings of the current study regarding the interactive
associations between gender and age on associations between
alcohol problems and depression are somewhat consistent
with the existing literature. Two previous studies also found
close associations between substance problems and depres-
sion-related problems in early adolescence, although these
studies used a sample of boys only (i.e., Loeber et al., 1999;
White et al., 2001). Specifically, Loeber and colleagues (1999)
found that internalizing problems predicted substance use
more strongly during pre-adolescence than during adoles-
cence, and White and colleagues (2001) also reported that
depressive symptoms were associated with alcohol use in early
adolescence. Some studies of both genders that found closer
associations between these problems among girls compared
with boys used mid-adolescent samples [13 to 18 in Bukstein
et al. (1992), 14 to 18 in Clark et al. (1997), 15 to 19 in Deykin
et al. (1992)], and studies reporting no gender differences used
mid-adolescent through adulthood samples [17 in Marmor-
stein and Iacono (2003), 14 to 18 followed to age 24 in Rohde
et al. (2001)].
The reasons for these gender differences are unclear. In
early adolescence, rates of depression among girls increase at
a markedly faster rate than among boys (e.g., Hankin et al.,
1998); perhaps young girls are more likely to self-medicate
their depressive symptoms by drinking alcohol, or perhaps
some girls become depressed because they are either drinking
or engaging in behaviors that may be associated with drinking
(e.g., spending time with delinquent peers). Reciprocally, in
early adulthood females may stop drinking heavily earlier
than males (e.g., Labouvie, 1996), so depression may become
less associated with alcohol problems among young women
during that time period. Future research using more closely-
spaced assessments and examining other potential mediating
and moderating factors would be useful in explaining this
pattern of associations.
This study confirms that clinicians should be aware that
youth experiencing high levels of depression or alcohol-
related problems are at risk for the development of the other
problem. Given the prominence of the ``self-medication''
model of alcoholism, clinicians should be especially alert to
the other direction of risk--alcohol problems predicting
depression. These links are especially striking among early
adolescent girls, so clinicians treating 1 of these problems
among this group should make sure to assess and continually
monitor clients for the development of the other problem.
The cross-sectional correlations between these problems were
somewhat less strong for women in early adulthood and for
males in both early adolescence and early adulthood, so clini-
cians working with these age groups may be less likely to find
these associations in their clients.
There were several limitations of this study. The measures
of depressive symptoms and alcohol problems were continu-
ous; clinically significant syndromes were not examined.
Therefore, it is not clear how these would apply to people
with major depressive disorder or with alcohol abuse or
dependence. Also, studies examining associations between
these problems are complicated by the differing natures of
depression and alcohol problems: specifically, depression is
conceived of as an episodic disorder, while alcohol problems
(particularly dependence) are relatively more stable (although
individuals can have waxing and waning symptoms). In this
study, depressive symptoms were assessed using a measure
that asked about experiences during the past week; in con-
trast, alcohol problems were assessed using a measure that
asked about experiences during the past 12 months. There-
fore, problems that occurred at times other than the assess-
ment windows for depressive symptoms and alcohol
problems were missed, and problems that appeared to be con-
current could actually have reflected alcohol problems that
preceded depressive symptoms within a single year. Cases in
which depressive symptoms preceded (or occurred together
with) alcohol problems but remitted by the week before the
assessment would have been missed. Although unfortunate
for analytic purposes, these differing assessment time frames
may be appropriate given differences in memory for these
problems. For example, a youth who had problems in school
due to drinking in the past year would be likely to remember
that event (e.g., being suspended), while a youth who felt sad
(but was not severely depressed) in the past year may not
remember that more transient feeling. Finally, due to the
wave 1 sampling strategy, these participants may not have
been completely representative of adolescents in the United
States (e.g., home-schooled adolescents and incarcerated ado-
lescents were not included); the results cannot be generalized
to the population of adolescents in the United States. Future
research examining whether associations between these prob-
lems are similar in people from different racial/ethnic back-
grounds and different socioeconomic strata would be useful.
This study contributed to our understanding of associa-
tions between depressive symptoms and alcohol problems
in several ways. Its use of a sample whose ages spanned
from early adolescence through early adulthood enabled us
to examine associations across this entire developmental
ALCOHOL USE-RELATED PROBLEMS AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS 57
period and not just part of it (e.g., during adolescence).
This age span, combined with the fact that the sample
included both males and females, allowed us to detect the
effects of gender during different developmental periods.
The community-based nature of the sample allowed us to
avoid the biases associated with treatment-seeking or high-
risk samples. In addition, this study's use of a growth
curve analytic approach allowed for an examination of
how each problem was likely to affect the trajectory of the
other problem within individuals. This approach differs
from most studies that examine whether 1 variable pre-
dicts another variable at a later time point and, therefore,
provides a unique and informative perspective on the
issue of how depressive and alcohol problems relate
longitudinally.
The results of this study indicate that both gender and
developmental stage are crucial factors to consider in examin-
ations of associations between depressive symptoms and alco-
hol use-related problems. Although each type of problem
tended to be associated with both increased levels of and
increased growth in the other problem, the initial associations
were stronger among females but growth in each problem
was predicted more strongly among males. Future research
examining the mechanisms behind these findings would be
useful in developing effective prevention and treatment pro-
grams for adolescents and young adults with depressive
and/or alcohol use-related problems.
