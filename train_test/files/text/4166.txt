Routines in the Family Context
Cultural psychology is interested in daily practices, especially in
routines and rituals, because these are built on belonging to the
culture and modified according to the needs of a culture's mem-
bers. Routines are particular to each family and reflect their
motivational and cultural models as moral values and norms
and also their cognitive expectations about reality, as in their
beliefs about family life or parenthood. Routines influence the
cultural systems that drive emotions and motivations and that
are shared by family members and reinforced by intergenera-
tional transmission. The "custom complex," the practices and
meanings shared and transmitted from generation to generation,
acquires a very important role in constructing the feelings of
people within the community (Mistry & Wu, 2010). Routines
are individual aspects of family organizations that provide a
specificmeaningtothegroupanditsactivities(Fiese,Hammons,
& Grigsby-Toussaint, 2012; Migliorini, Cardinali, & Rania,
2011). Routines are defined as models of interaction and behav-
ior including two or more family members; because of their rep-
etition and stability over time, they provide predictability and
specific meaning for groups (Budescu & Taylor, 2013). Thus,
family routines are daily practices that are regularly repeated
within families (meals, bedtime, housework) that in fact
characterize it, making it unique (Fiese, 2006). Routines are
modified following family life cycle transitions, so that they
allow families to better accommodate changes.They are charac-
terized by instrumental communication and define activities and
tasks that people are expected to perform in a group, such as
specific family celebrations, different traditions of celebrating
birthdays or holidays, and interactive practices of daily life.
Some characteristics of family routines are similar in different
families or cultural contexts but do not necessarily have the
same meaning or the same functions. For example, gender roles
and beliefs about children's autonomy are influenced by cultural
models that express themselves in different ways in the daily
routines of families from different cultures (Spagnola & Fiese,
2007). Daily life is not just the background against which family
interactions develop but is also a protective factor that promotes
family well-being (Passini, Melotti, Palareti, & Emiliani, 2003);
increasing feelings of safety, belonging, stability, cohesion, and

Daily Family Routines of Italian and
Ecuadorian Immigrant Mothers in
Everyday Life: A Qualitative Approach
Using Diaries and Interviews
Nadia Rania1, Laura Migliorini1, Stefania Rebora1,
and Paola Cardinali1
Abstract
This study compares Italian mothers' and Ecuadorian immigrant mothers' daily family routines. Thirty mothers took part in
this investigation: 15 Italians (M = 37.5 years, with ages ranging from 30 to 42 years) and 15 Ecuadorians (M = 36.1 years,
with ages ranging from 18 to 46 years and having lived in Italy for an average of 15 years), with children ranging in age from
4 to 8 years. The objective is to highlight the differences and similarities between the daily routines and family relations that
characterize the lives of each of the two groups of participants. The instruments employed in service of these aims were
in-depth interviews and diaries. The results showed similarities regarding the routines of Italian and Ecuadorian families.
However, a relevant difference emerged regarding their perceptions of social support. Specifically, Italians receive more
social support from their parents than do Ecuadorians, who are supported more by other relatives or by friends.

satisfaction; and empowering children's social skills (Spagnola
& Fiese, 2007) and their mental and physical health (Worthman,
2011).
Family Routines With Young Children
Routines are factors that mediate and interact with the ele-
ments that characterize children's development and with the
evolution of the entire family. Most family activities and rou-
tines change over time, evolving with children's growth and
development. Fiese (2006) affirms that the routines of fami-
lies with young children become more regular, for example,
mealtimes, weekend activities, and negotiating new routines
such as reading a story before bedtime or playing games
together (Fiese, 2006). Another change that follows the
arrival of a child is the introduction of the grandparent figure,
who is able to materially and psychologically support the
parents, playing the role of a "stress buffer" (Botcheva &
Feldman, 2004). Grandparents help parents manage their
children, making up for the lack of a welfare state (Stevenson,
Henderson, & Baugh, 2007), in particular in families in
which the mother has a job. They are figures whom parents
trust and who can care for their grandchildren with compe-
tence and effectiveness (Gerard, Landry-Meyer, & Guzell
Roe, 2006). Routines help to structure children's acceptable
social behaviors. In the preschool period, children and par-
ents begin to negotiate some daily routines, for example, per-
sonal cleanliness, bedtimes, and behavior during meals
(Spagnola & Fiese, 2007). It must be highlighted that the
routines'structure and the parent­child interactions and rela-
tionships cannot be ascribed solely to personality traits or to
the behaviors of other people; they are also the result of
mutual interactions with the social and cultural contexts of
families' countries of origin (Izquierdo et al., 2006; Keller
et al., 2005; Kremer-Sadlik, Izquierdo, & Fatigante, 2010).
As maintained by Worthman (2010), culture has a large
influence on constructing everyday experiences during
development; it becomes embodied through "natural" nur-
turing. Spagnola and Fiese (2007) demonstrate that pre-
school children have more influence on the family unit
because they are old enough to become more active partici-
pants in the daily course of family life and routines. In fact,
during this period the family's attention shifts from the cou-
ple toward their child (Fiese, Hooker, Kotary, & Schwagler,
1993). The preschool period seems to be a critical time for
family development; during this period, there is an increase
in mealtime and weekend routines (Fiese et al., 1993). The
importance of mealtime and bedtime routines for the fami-
lies of young children emerges from studies, and indeed,
these routines are used to communicate to children the rules
about social engagement and how to face and organize daily
activities. As was already stated, routines originally aimed to
achieve daily tasks, but it is not unusual for them to take on
an emotional connotation and a resulting change in rituals
because simple activities acquire meaning. For example,
bedtime is not only about getting children to fall asleep, but
is also an occasion to spend quality time with them, to be
together, cuddling and showing affection (Spagnola & Fiese,
2007). Mealtimes are another family routine that is associ-
ated with better child mental and physical health (Flores,
Tomany-Korman, & Olson, 2005; Munoz, Israel, &
Anderson, 2007). For example, during mealtimes, children
have the opportunity to develop their language skills; during
dinner, families discuss the events of the day, talk about past
stories, make plans for the future and so on (Spagnola &
Fiese, 2007), all of which exposes children to rich language,
narratives, explanations, and cultural rules about speech
(Aukrust, 2002; Ely, Gleason, MacGibbon, & Zaretsky,
2001). The presence of a number of people during meals
allows the language to become richer and more complex than
in a dyadic situation (Blum-Kulka & Snow, 2002). The con-
versation during mealtimes can explicate the family's emo-
tional climate because it is characterized by verbal and
nonverbal affective expressions and offers the opportunity to
talk about feelings, affect, and empathy (Herot, 2002). One
more routine that is important for families with young chil-
dren is reading books together; this can support the develop-
ment of literacy skills and sets the stage for enjoying their
school years (Fiese, Eckert, & Spagnola, 2006). Rosenkoetter
and Barton (2002) suggest that the routine of joint book read-
ing promotes later academic success. This routine not only
involves regular engagement with family members but also
cuddling, explicitly, through the reading of a favorite story,
taking turns repeating familiar statements, adding personal
touches to the story and so on. This allows children to per-
ceive book reading as a positive event, a positive experience
that will be useful during school years. In the lives of young
children, routines also improve socialization skills and repre-
sent an opportunity to build "scaffolding" to positively sup-
port children's development. They enable children to
structure their behavior toward achieving goals and then
present the opportunity to offer praise and encouragement
for accomplishing them (Martini, 2002).
However, within the theoretical framework that has been
outlined, and considering the breadth of the work on this
issue, there are few studies of routines in the contexts of
migration. Few studies investigate the everyday lives of fam-
ilies, which is an important component of family well-being.
The entire migratory process, in fact, could represent a
potential factor of family vulnerability.
Family and Migration
Western countries, and societies in general, are now living in a
global and multicultural context (Cushner, 2008) in which
embedded people directly experience mutual cultural influ-
ences between the people in their daily lives. Migration, in fact,
is considered, from a community psychology perspective, an
ecological transition that involves vast changes in the contexts
of interactions (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Garcia-Ramirez et al.,
Rania et al. 3
2005). The recent multiethnic dimensions of individual coun-
tries, and of Western societies in general, animate various stud-
ies about immigrants' integration (Dandy & Pe-Pua, 2010). In
these contexts, immigrant groups often find themselves in the
minority position, which has implications for the ways in which
they adapt and negotiate their ethnic and cultural identities
(Soon, 2002; Yijälä, Lönnqvist, Jasinskaja-Lahti, & Verkasalo,
2012). In addition, native families are involved in a process of
mutual exchange that occurs when different cultural groups
come into contact with each other (Van Oudenhoven & Ward,
2013), and indeed, acculturation processes produce changes in
both migrant populations and the host communities (Larsen,
Vazov, Krumov, & Schneider, 2013; Rania, Migliorini,
Cardinali, & Rebora, 2015; Rania, Migliorini, Rebora, &
Cardinali, 2014, 2015).
The migration experience should be read in the particular
situations in which it is placed; each family that migrates, in
fact, participates in a variety of contexts that may represent
conditions of inclusion or exclusion, areas that are character-
ized by different ethnic and/or social classes, education lev-
els, religions, and so on. These factors make up a particular
ecological niche (Super & Harkness, 1986) that corresponds
to a set of protective or risk factors and to processes of nor-
mality or specific difficulty. People who move to a new
country are also exposed to important changes and life stress-
ors associated with the search for home or work, the recogni-
tion of skills acquired in the country of origin, and the
identification of resources and services that allow them to
integrate into the new situation without excessive psycho-
logical or emotional costs (Kelaher, Williams, & Manderson,
2001). The migration experience is generally a highly stress-
ful event for many reasons from the need to learn a new lan-
guage in a short time to facing possible discrimination; in
these cases, the stress related to the new environment adds to
the stress of family life (Baccallao & Smokowsky, 2007).
Adapting to a new culture has been identified as a phenom-
enon of culture shock. Culture shock is the transition from a
familiar to an unfamiliar environment in which old behavior
patterns become ineffective (Lysgaard, 1955). The stages of
adaptation are euphoria (honeymoon), disillusionment,
adjustment, and integration (Beamer & Varner, 2003).
Individual adaptation to the new cultural context may be
favored by positive feelings and satisfaction about a person's
own situation and the sense of self-efficacy he or she per-
ceives in the context, that is, the individual's ability to
develop relationships with people who belong to the host
culture (Moghaddam, Taylor, & Wright, 1993).
According to Ward (1996), the intensity of the stress and
difficulties related to the new contexts for immigrants depend
on how much the original culture differs from the host cul-
ture; this difference may be moderated by contact with the
host culture and by factors such as language skills, motiva-
tion, and supportive social inclusion. The process of mutual
adaptation that follows is a basic human need; individuals
must regain equilibrium and the sense of security and
belonging that is so strongly connected with psychological
and social well-being.
Migration also carries within it some changes: family
structure linked to migratory movements (starting order and
reunions), the distance from the country of origin, and the
consequent maintenance of two memberships, the transna-
tional families (Boccagni & Lagomarsino, 2011; Herrera,
Carrillo, & Torres, 2005), and the family structure tends to
become larger than the nuclear family structure that held in
the country of origin (Donati, 2014; Ghiringhelli & Marelli,
2011). The migration process can reflect extreme situations
in which minors are alone in the migration, following a
familiar mandate, and this condition presents a peculiar fra-
gility. For this reason, institutions create services that support
unaccompanied children in the attempt to replace the absence
of their families (Rania, Migliorini, Sclavo, Cardinali, &
Lotti, 2014).
The literature has given importance to the cultural parent-
ing model related to children's education and growth
(Kgitçibasi, 2006; Moscardino, Nwobu, & Axia, 2006;
Penderi & Petrogiannis, 2011). Adult migrants bring with
them ideas, values, and expectations that may differ greatly
from the cultural patterns shared by members of the host
society (Bornstein & Cote, 2004; García Coll & Pachter,
2002). They possess implicit knowledge about educating
children, including development goals, care practices, com-
munication styles, and values, and they are involved in a pro-
cess of encounter-clash with the attitudes and parenting
behaviors of the new country (Gratier, 2003). These styles,
objectives, and care practices create knowledge and beliefs
that tend to remain unchanged for a time when families
change their physical environments and cultural references
even when circumstances in the receiving country are differ-
ent from those in the country of origin.
The challenge for these families is to attempt to bring
together different meanings and cultural knowledge related
to parenting styles and child care practices, attempting to
manage their ambivalence between the desire to keep their
cultural interpretation and the desire to acquire those of the
host society. A phenomenon present in the literature is the
role reversing in the processes of socialization in the new
context where a child or adolescent takes care of typical roles
and responsibilities of adulthood, becoming a familiar pat-
tern that may be dysfunctional (Scabini, Regalia, Giuliani,
2007). A number of studies (Keller et al., 2007; Keller,
Borke, Chaudhary, Lamm, & Kleis, 2010; Keller et al., 2004)
have noted that the belief systems of immigrant parents tend
to resemble those used in the country of origin from previous
generations. That is, ideas, beliefs, and care and socialization
practices appear to represent cultural patterns that are rela-
tively resistant to change. However, a number of other
researchers have noted that the attitudes, values, and behav-
iors of immigrant families are influenced by processes of
acculturation and integration within the host cultures (Berry,
1997; Bornstein & Cote, 2006).

The Context of the Study
Ecuadorian migration in Italy dates back to 1970 and the
highest increase attendance Ecuadorian registers in the sec-
ond half of the nineties. Available data show that between
1992 and 2002, the Ecuadorian community in Italy has
increased from 1.037 to 11.170 legally residing. Ecuadorian
immigration in Italy is characterized by the prevalence of
female employed mainly in the field of social services and
people. The presence of Ecuadorian is consolidating with
an increase of the second generation and long-term resi-
dence permits, as well as an increase in family reunifica-
tion. In sociodemographic composition of Ecuadorian
immigration, it is possible to identify three profiles, which
may be corresponding to several stages of the migration
cycle: the first migrants (mainly women), children reunited,
and reconstituted families (Boccagni & Lagomarsino,
2011). The present study was conducted in Genoa, a city of
Liguria region (Italy). In Genoa, Ecuadorians are the larg-
est of immigrant groups. On January 1, 2011, the most
numerous cultural groups (in thousands) in Italy were
Romanian (968.576), Albanian (482.627), and Moroccan
(452.424), but Liguria does not reflect this cultural break-
down; in fact, the cultural group with the largest presence is
the Ecuadorians (22.038 individuals, 17.6% of the foreign
population in Italy). North Italy, with 81% of admissions, is
the first goal of the Ecuadorian community, with a higher
incidence of more than 16 percentage points compared to
the overall immigrant population (65%). The first three
regions of settlement are Lombardia (44.5%), Liguria
(24.5%), and Lazio (10.7%). Liguria is the second most
popular Italian region among Ecuadorians, in particular,
most of them choosing to live in Genoa (16.753; Istituto
nazionale di statistica [ISTAT], 2012). Not surprisingly,
most of the Ecuadorian immigrants come from the city of
Guayaquil, where there is a huge presence of Italians from
Genoa who migrated there at the end of the 19th century. In
the 1990s, Ecuador survived a socioeconomic crisis that
drained the middle class and supported an exodus. Studies
conducted in Genoa have noted that from the beginning of
the Ecuadorian migration phenomenon in Italy, the women
led the way in the migration (Pagnotta, 2003), to be joined
by their husbands and children later (Queirolo Palmas,
2004). These women were accustomed to finding employ-
ment as housemaids and especially as in-home nurses
because of the large number of elderly people living in
Genoa (27.8% of the population; ISTAT, 2012). Regarding
studies conducted on immigrant women in Italy, they
underline the characteristics of Ecuadorian culture and they
deepen the different gender role in the family structure.
Boccagni and Lagomarsino (2011) focus on the dynamics
of transnational motherhood of Ecuadorians, who have to
manage the difficult balance to cover two different but
complementary roles: breadwinner and caregiver at a
distance.
The Research
Objectives
This study aimed to explore, applying cross-cultural
approach, the similarities and differences between Italian
and Ecuadorian mothers in routines and family relations that
are generally investigated in cultural psychology. The study
was specifically focused on culturally determined family
routines and lifestyles, which provided a global perspective
on a regular family day, including the habits and behaviors in
specific daily situations (e.g., taking the children to school or
picking them up, dinner organization). The analysis of the
families' routines allowed us to understand how parental
roles are structured and how couples share domestic tasks.
Furthermore, it enabled us to understand how the routines
helped to know the roles of the people who provided social
support in daily life and child care.
Method
Participants
Thirty mothers living in Genoa took part in the present study,
each with a child below 10 years of age. This family phase
was chosen because family routines are particularly impor-
tant for the development of young children (Spagnola &
Fiese, 2007). Fifteen mothers were Italian (M age = 37.5
years, range = 30-42 years), and 15 were from Ecuador (M
age = 36.1 years, range = 18-46 years), who had lived in Italy
for 10 to 23 years (M = 15). Ecuadorian participants were
first immigration and did not speak Italian before arriving in
Genoa. There was little difference between the groups with
regard to the number of children (M = 1.7 Italians, M = 1.6
Ecuadorians) and age (M = 6.5 Italians, M = 8.5 Ecuadorians).
Some of the foreign participants were recruited through the
church, which plays a large role in the Ecuadorian commu-
nity in this city, and more were identified through snowball
sampling; after the interviews, many mothers provided the
contact details of friends who agreed to take part in the
research. The Italian participants were recruited through
their children's schools. The majority of Italian participants
were married (n = 12), only 1 was separated and 2 were
cohabiting. Similarly, most of the Ecuadorian mothers were
married (n = 9) or cohabiting (n = 4); 1 was divorced and 1
was a single mother, and their partners were also Ecuadorian.
In the Italian group, 8 participants had a job and 7 were
unemployed. Similarly, in the Ecuadorian group, 8 partici-
pants were employed, primarily as domestic workers, and 7
were unemployed. The education qualifications possessed
by the most participants in both groups was high school
graduation (Italians n = 9, Ecuadorians n = 11). Three Italian
and 3 Ecuadorian mothers had college degrees, and 3 Italian
mothers and 1 Ecuadorian mother possessed a middle school
degree. Generalizing these data, it was possible to affirm the
homogeneity of the two participant groups.

Measures
This study had a multimethod approach that used different
self-report techniques (diaries and in-depth interviews) to
investigate the same participants about the same topic
(Kremer-Sadlik, Fatigante, & Fasulo, 2008; Overall &
Sibley, 2010), but in reading about the object families from
different points of view, with the diaries, the researcher
focused on routines and practices during interactions, and
through the interviews, the researcher was able to access the
internal representation of the relationship and how people
make sense of personal experiences.
Diary method. In the present research, two types of written
diary, each completed only once, investigated the partici-
pants' and their families' habits on a regular weekday and a
regular weekend, providing a view of Italian and Ecuadorian
families' current routines. The main dimensions investigated
were family routines and lifestyles. The diary's grid was
divided into three main areas: morning, afternoon, and eve-
ning (Kremer-Sadlik et al., 2008). Participants were also
asked to provide the times and places where activities took
place and details of the people who took part in the activities
(Overall & Sibley, 2010).
In-depth interviews.The in-depth interviews followed the
Ecocultural Family Interview (EFI; Weisner, Coots, & Bern-
heimer, 1997), which collates narrations about people's daily
routines to document the culture and specific ecology of a
community. The interviewee was invited to rethink his or her
regular day, describing the actions, customs, feelings, and
reason that underlie the routines. The dimensions investi-
gated were family routines and lifestyles. The interview
begins by asking the mother if she can tell "typical day" and
then it is deepened themes that emerge spontaneously from
conversation.
Procedure
This research was conducted following the ethical norms
stipulated by the AIP (Italian Psychology Association). The
meeting place (usually the school the children attended or the
church) and time of interview varied according to the moth-
ers' availability. Interviews were conducted by an Italian
research team, in the Italian language, without the need for
an interpreter, and they were usually 1 hr in duration. Before
the interview, each participant received an informed consent
form that contained a brief explanation about the research
and informed potential participants that the interview would
be audio-recorded and the data processed and anonymized; it
also assigned a code to each participant that allowed her
interview to be aggregated with those of the other mothers
during the analysis, in compliance with Italian Law on
Privacy n.196/2003. After the interviews, the researchers
asked each participant to fill in a diary that allowed for
systematizing the information that emerged during the
interviews.
Data Analysis
Diary. The data from the diaries were codified by two inde-
pendent judges. They used grids for each diary type (week-
days and weekends) that separated the Italian and Ecuadorian
participants. The data were organized in two tables to facili-
tate comparison between the immigrant and Italian mothers
during weekdays and weekends.
In-depth interviews. The in-depth interviews were codified by
two independent judges following the constant comparison
analysis technique (Leech & Onwuegbuzie, 2011) within a
grounded theory approach (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). The
judges applied the protocol analysis separately, and after-
ward met to compare the identified categories and select
those that best accounted for the different points of view to
obtain a common categorization using NVivo 9 software data
analysis (2010). In the event of discord between the two
judges, they discussed the item to reach agreement.
Results
Below are the results of the routines and lifestyles that were
investigated through the diaries and the interviews. Two
additional areas are also presented: parental roles and the
sharing of tasks and social support, both of which emerged
during the deeper investigations of the families' routine life-
styles through the interviews.
Family Routine and Daily Lifestyles
Data analysis highlighted the most significant moments in the
families' daily routines, from waking the children until the
moment they went to sleep. In the following tables, some
examples are presented of diary entries for weekdays (Table 1)
and weekends (Table 2) from the mothers in both groups.
On weekdays, the women in both groups awoke in the
morning at very similar hours (6.30-8.00 a.m.), although in
a few cases, the Ecuadorians woke up very early (5.45
a.m.). Italians have breakfast with their children more
often, whereas Ecuadorians eat alone, although the number
of mothers who had breakfast with the entire nuclear family
was the same in both groups. The majority of time, mothers
in both Italian and Ecuadorian families take the children to
school and pick them up. In both groups, most mothers are
employed, although others do housework in the mornings.
The lunchtimes are similar (12:00-2:00 p.m.). The Italians
and Ecuadorians were equally distributed across all possi-
ble options: having lunch alone, with children, or with the
nuclear family. The Italian lunch is a complete meal con-
sisting of pasta and a main dish; Ecuadorian mothers pre-
ferred to eat Italian food most frequently, generally
6 SAGE Open
including pasta; some of them alternated between Italian
and ethnic food, and in a few cases, participants stated that
they ate exclusively traditional dishes or fast food. In the
afternoons, it was again mothers who mainly picked the
children up from school, and the children in both groups do
homework or play outdoors; Italian children played sports
more often than Ecuadorians. Dinnertime (7:30-9:30 p.m.)
for both Italians and Ecuadorians is mainly spent with the
nuclear family. Italian mothers prefer to eat only one course,
pasta or a main dish, whereas the Ecuadorian mothers more
often alternate their traditional dishes with Italians ones or
prefer to eat Italian food. After dinner, the mothers of both
allow their children time to play or watch television. In
families interviewed from both cultural backgrounds, it is
the mother who usually puts the children to bed by 10:30
p.m. Italians cuddle and talk with the children, tell them a
story or pray; Ecuadorians did not report any particular
routine, just that some mothers prefer to tell a story or pray
with the children.
On the weekends, both groups awake between 7:00 a.m.
and 9:00 a.m. Italians have breakfast with the family more
often than Ecuadorians, who are accustomed to having
breakfast only with their children. On Sunday mornings,
most Italian and Ecuadorian families go to church, and in
almost the same number of cases, Italians report that they go
out. Native families have lunch earlier (12:00-1:30 p.m.)
than do immigrant families (12:00-3:00 p.m.). For both
groups, Sunday lunch involves the entire nuclear family, and
in the Ecuadorian group, if possible, the grandparents are
also present. Italian mothers prefer to cook a richer, more
substantial meal than on weekdays, but nearly the same num-
ber stated they cooked the same meal as on weekdays.
Ecuadorian mothers prefer to cook Italian food, sometimes
alternating with traditional dishes; only two of them stated

that they cook exclusively ethnic food. Usually, the children
of both groups spend afternoons with their parents and fre-
quently outdoors in parks, at the cinema or at malls.
Concerning dinner, Ecuadorians seem to eat later (7:30-9:00
p.m.) than Italians (7:00-8:00 p.m.), and, as with lunch, all
members of the nuclear family are present in both groups. A
food that seems to be reserved for both Ecuadorians and
Italians for Sunday dinner is pizza; moreover, immigrants
prefer mostly Italian food in general. On the weekends,
mothers from both groups put their children to bed in the
same way as on weekdays, although Italian children seem to
go to bed later (9:00-11:00 p.m.).
The in-depth interviews investigated the same moments
of the day that were identified in the diaries (morning, after-
noon, evening) to obtain perceptions of the represented fam-
ily regarding the activities and routines that characterize
those moments. The narrations revealed that nearly always,
the mothers (Italian and Ecuadorian) were responsible for
waking the children up, cooking breakfast, and taking them
to kindergarten--both working mothers and housewives--
as was corroborated by the data collected in the diaries: "In
the morning, I wake up at 7:00 a.m. and cook breakfast for
my children" (Ecuadorian02); "In the morning, we get up, I
cook breakfast, we eat it, and after, I take the children to
school" (Italian12). In some cases, the grandparents helped
out by taking the children to kindergarten, more among the
Italian mothers than the immigrants. "We leave for work at
7:00 a.m., so my parents come to our home and take the
children to school; they do that every morning" (Italian05).
Only a few Ecuadorian mothers preferred to share accompa-
nying the children to school with their husbands: "Sometimes
I take her to school, and sometimes my husband; it depends
on our tasks" (Ecuadorian01). Some Italian mothers used
the school bus service (Italian01: "I see off my son to take
the school bus; it is really near to my home"). As was also
highlighted in the diaries, mothers are also the protagonists
of managing the afternoon activities. The results showed
that Italian children were more committed to sports activi-
ties than were the immigrant children (Italian09: "Almost
every afternoon, we are busy because of the sports; they
play football and volleyball"). Similarly, Italian children go
out to play more often, accompanied by their mothers
(Italian11: "They need to vent in the afternoon; that's why I
take them to the park or the beach to play until 6:30 p.m."),
or they go to the cinema (Italian14: "I often take her to the
cinema or the theater. She really likes it") or to catechism
(Italian06: "Once a week, I take her to catechism") and
church meetings (Italian05: "We go to the Jehovah's
Witnesses' meetings. They have to be put in contact with
God"). Only a very small number of both groups referred to
taking their children to play with friends (Italian01: "In the
afternoon, I often accommodate in my home my children's
friends, or I take them to their friends' houses to play
together"). The dinner routine characterized the final part of
the day; it was described by the mothers in both groups as an
important moment that allowed the family to meet together
and talk about the experiences of the day (Ecuadorian12:
"We have dinner together; it is a moment to talk and share
what we did during the day." Italian10: "Yes, we have din-
ner together every day; it is an important moment for the
family"). The participants referred to the "sacrifices" they
made in managing the daily routines. A large number com-
plained that they had hectic lives and had no time for them-
selves (Italian02: "It is normal to make sacrifices for the
family. I stay all the day with my children, and I realize that
is difficult to go to the hairstylist or to the doctor"). Others
stressed how their lives were now entirely centered on their
children (Italian08: "Your life as a parent changes. For
example, the schedule, at 9:00 p.m. you are almost going to
sleep, which is more suitable for children"). Some mothers
who were interviewed highlighted how difficult things
could be because their parents lived in another country
(Ecuadorian15: "Becoming a mother stops everything! My
daughters are my life, but they stopped everything, also
because I don't have help. I have to manage everything:
work, home, children. Everything, everything, every-
thing!"). One more difficulty that emerged was finding the
time for their relationships and their husbands, without the
presence of children, a difficulty that was noted more by
the Italians than the Ecuadorians (Italian09: "I have not been
alone with my husband since the honeymoon. I desire to
take a trip of a couple of days with him, without children.
This kind of freedom is the only sacrifice that I perceive").
In addition, mothers in both groups reported feeling
oppressed by the economic commitment necessary to ensure
their children's material well-being (Italian12: "If you live
with a salaried worker, you stupidly give up something for
yourself to buy that for your daughter"; Ecuadorian07: "I
give up many things! I didn't buy a coat for one year. Before
I bought clothes for me; now I think primarily of my
children").
Parental Roles and Sharing of Tasks
The family routine that generally involves fathers is the
shared game that usually occurs at home during the final part
of the day (Ecuadorian13: "Mostly she plays with her father.
It is an important moment for my husband, and he wants to
enjoy it, and they play and laugh a lot!" Italian14: "Since
always, it is my husband who plays with the children. I think
that fathers are born to do that"). Many mothers, mostly
Ecuadorian, said that they frequently play with their children
(Ecuadorian08: "Maybe we draw or we cook together; if she
wants we play Monopoly"), and a few mothers said that they
play together (Italian03: "We play Ring a Ring o'Roses or
other games such as little puzzles . . . she has fun"). There was
also one child who played alone (Ecuadorian06: "He plays
alone almost always, with the PlayStation"), and one mother
reported playing with her children on rare occasions
(Italian01: "I had more time to play with them before; now
8 SAGE Open
there is my job, and then to care about the house . . . I don't
have much time"). Some Italian women referred to frequently
organizing play dates that allow their children to play with
their friends (Italian05: "The days that they are free, I try to
ensure that they always have company to play with. I invite
home their friends, or I take my children to their friends'
houses"). Furthermore, as in the case of games, putting chil-
dren to bed was often a father's task in both groups
(Ecuadorian11: "Usually his father makes him fall asleep; it is
his task"; Italian04: "Usually her father at 9 o'clock takes her
to her room and she falls asleep"), although some Italian and
Ecuadorian couples did that together (Italian07: "Me and my
husband usually bed down children together to do it faster";
Ecuadorian10: "Together we prepare her for sleep, baby bot-
tle, diaper"). Families manage this in different ways; physical
contact was important (Ecuadorian10: "She falls asleep in my
arms"; Italian08: "She needs contact; she needs to touch me
to fall asleep"), as was reading stories (Ecuadorian03: "They
sleep when I read them a story"; Italian15: "When they were
younger, I read them tales; now that they are grown, they read
by themselves"). In particular, some children were in the
habit of spending a large part of the night or the entire night in
the parents' bed, and it emerged that in some cases, the par-
ents did not want to give up this practice (Ecuadorian14: "He
falls asleep only if he is in my bed with me, and then I take
him to his bed"; Italian13: "He still sleeps with us . . . he is
cuddled by mum and dad, actually more by dad, who wants
our child to sleep with us, and says: `Until we can do that'").
Some mothers said that they sent their children to sleep with
a simple exchange of kisses and saying goodnight (Italian07:
"We are lucky; they simply want a kiss and then fall asleep
without problems"; Ecuadorian15: "My eldest daughter
comes to say goodnight before going to bed, and we kiss each
other"). However, some other interviewees reported on this
moment as an opportunity to play with their children
(Italian03: "We lie together in bed playing, and then he falls
asleep"; Ecuadorian14: "He usually falls asleep alone, play-
ing with his cars"), to talk (Italian14: "It is a beautiful moment
because we talk about the day spent"), or to say a prayer
together (Ecuadorian03: "They lie down and we pray
together"; Italian13: "Before going to sleep, we say a prayer
to thank God for the day"). For some Ecuadorian children, the
routine of going to sleep includes listening to music
(Ecuadorian13: "She washes herself, and later she listens to
music to fall asleep"), watching television (Ecuadorian08: "I
use the timer on the television, 30 minutes and then every-
body is asleep"), or having a shower (Ecuadorian05: "His
ritual before going to sleep is take a shower; he wants me to
wash him"). As a result, some Ecuadorian mothers said that
their children needed a great deal of time to fall asleep
(Ecuadorian04: "It is not easy for my son to fall asleep; it usu-
ally takes him 30 minutes"), and a few Italians affirmed that
their children are used to falling asleep on the couch (Italian12:
"It is easy to get her to fall asleep; you just have to lay her on
the couch").
Social Support in Daily Routines
In terms of the support that they received with respect to
child care, although they were the predominant figures in the
development of daily routines, the mothers related how they
received support from their husbands (Ecuadorian10: "My
husband is really helpful. He says to me: `Don't worry about
that, I will do it'"; Italian08: "It is something natural. We
never make a firm division of tasks; we help each other"),
their grandparents (especially Italians; Italian03: "We try to
do everything by ourselves, but for every need, we know that
we can count on our parents"), and other kin or friends, usu-
ally compatriots (especially Ecuadorians): "Usually I ask for
help from the mothers of my children's classmates, who are
Italian and Ecuadorians mothers. They escort my children
from school to home. We help each other mutually.An Italian
girl really helped me when my children were younger and
didn't go to kindergarten, I didn't know who to trust them
with!" (Ecuadorian08)
Some Italian mothers are supported in family routines by
a babysitter (Italian11: "This year, I asked for help from a
babysitter, because I cannot do more").
However, not all participants reported being helped by
someone in managing their children. Indeed, approximately
half of them stated they were nearly alone; they could not rely
upon their husbands, mostly because of work (Ecuadorian11:
"Nobody helps me. Until this moment, I did everything by
myself"). It is important, however, to stress that a small num-
ber of mothers considered themselves more suited to caring
for children (Italian14: "I do everything, mostly because men
are not able to understand").
Discussion and Conclusion
This work has allowed us to deepen the analysis of family
routines in a context of migration that has been little studied
in the literature. Comparing the family lifestyles of Italian
and Ecuadorian immigrants reveals competence in family
systems regarding building routines in this delicate stage
with young children, who are important representatives of
family well-being. During the transition to parenthood and
the phase of the life cycle with young children, balancing the
parental role, work, and family is a crucial developmental
task (Feldman, Sussman, & Zigler, 2004).
Analyzing these routines has allowed us to combine the
presence of events, child care, and regular activities and, at
the same time, the perception of how these are conducted by
the family components. Furthermore, the functions that rou-
tines play in the coordination of multiple lines of activities
wereanalyzedinworkingmothersbyAlbyandZucchermaglio
(2014). In fact, in analyzing the daily routines, the everyday
actions and the meanings attributed to them, it is possible to
access the implicit aspects of culture (Axia & Weisner,
2000). Furthermore, investigating routines allowed for the
indirect analysis of family processes, such as the balance of
Rania et al. 9
roles, family cohesion, and support, all of which are impor-
tant elements of family life.
In everyday practice, people rework the categories of man
and woman and their attributions, even though gender cannot
be considered to be tied to a specific context but pervades our
whole life. In family settings, gender features are confirmed
and/or changed as "social construction." A family can be
considered a particular community of practices in which
these processes are embedded. Addressing the issue of gen-
der within the family itself is a complex issue for a number
of reasons. First, in recent decades, one is confronted with
deep changes related to being a family and to parenting
(Migliorini & Rania, 2008) that are not always followed by
cultural and social changes. Second, recent decades have
seen an increase in women working outside of the home,
with demands from both the employment and the family con-
texts. This condition has contributed to increased stress and
role overload (Higgins, Duxbury, & Lyons, 2010).
In the present article, through the analysis of the diaries
and in-depth interviews, we underlined similarities and dif-
ferences between Italian and Ecuadorian mothers in manag-
ing their daily routines and caring in their parental roles. The
most important result that emerges is the similar matrifocal
element of the family units, indeed mothers complied with
self-report techniques. The main element that appeared from
our interviews was the prevalence of women in all the activi-
ties that were examined, for both Italians and Ecuadorians, as
was also reported in a study by Pinto and Coltrane (2013). In
most cases, mothers reported that they had the main role in
the child and family care practices and in the domestic work,
in line with the study by Zajczick and Ruspini (2008).
The data seem to reveal that the main commonality
between the groups of participants was the traditional gender
role perspective: Women are devoted to family tasks and
manage the housework, and men earn the income (Evertsson
& Nermo, 2004). However, the mothers confirmed that the
father figure was involved more in affective and emotional
dimensions, for example, with bedtime routines and games;
this is consistent with recent researches realized in Italian
context with working mothers and fathers (Alby & Di Pede,
2014; Alby, Fatigante, & Zucchermaglio, 2014). These
results prefigure one area that is associated with affective
father figures that in the scientific literature is generally asso-
ciated with the role of the mother (Scabini & Cigoli, 2012).
These data can be understood in the light of recent studies
about the involvement of fathers (Yoshida, 2012). However,
Tanturri and Mencarini (2009) underline, with their research,
that the children care is a mainly female task, while the
Italian father's participation is restricted to certain activities.
Furthermore, children care by fathers is high only in few
families. The data of present work, in line with several
Italians recent studies (Alby & Di Pede, 2014; Alby et al.,
2014), propose the image of a paternity slowly changing and
that is being redefined: new fathers seem to be more involved
in the care of the children but mainly in recreational and
executive activities, whereas mothers have a more active and
organizational role than fathers.
According to the mothers who were interviewed, grand-
parents were the second most present figures in managing
the children's routines, although in the diaries, grandparents
were not named by a large number of mothers. In that regard,
we hypothesized that mother perceived grandfather and
grandmother social support more than daily routine states in
their diary. Their presence was especially identified in the
Italian group in line with Balsamo (2003). In general,
Ecuadorian mothers could not count on their own parents'
support because they lived in their country of origin; there-
fore, these mothers relied more on brothers, brothers-in-law,
and friends, who were considered an additional source of
help and support and were usually compatriots, as was found
in previous studies (Chelpi-den Hamer, 2008). Nevertheless,
one Ecuadorian participant enjoyed the help of her own par-
ents because they lived near her family in the host country.
Grandparents provide material and social support to their
families; they help to raise children and reduce the stress of
the work­family balance (Colombo & Sciortino, 2008;
Gerard et al., 2006). In the literature, feeling balanced across
work and family life is important because it is related to
many well-being outcomes (Milkie, Kendig, Nomaguchi, &
Denny, 2010). Beliefs and attitudes related to gender are an
important factor in the analysis of the determinants of moth-
ers' and fathers' involvement in child care and housework
tasks (Tognetti, 2011). This was demonstrated by husbands
with egalitarian beliefs who performed more housework than
did men with a traditional view of gender roles (Bulanda,
2004).
It is worth noting that the activities in which the mother
feels supported by the partner were not always undertaken
exclusively by the partner; indeed, the fathers were not
included in completing the diary entries. When the husbands
helped, it was not part of their own daily tasks but concerned
routines that the spouses did together, and in some cases, the
husband replaced the spouse if she was occupied at that
moment, as was found by Kroska (2004). Despite the percep-
tion of receiving support from their husbands, most mothers
in both groups reported feeling overloaded because of the
different roles they filled every day (Higgins et al., 2010); the
mothers also referred to the little time they had to devote to
themselves and as couples (Carnielli Howat-Rodrigues,
Suemi Tokumaru, Novaes de Amorim, Garcia, & Izar, 2013).
Thisresearchthusindicates,forbothItaliansandEcuadorians,
a mixed model of managing family roles--against the tradi-
tional family model--with an imbalance of care tasks being
allocated to women but also more balanced child care.
The research also shows the dynamics of family relation-
ships in terms of gift debt recognition (Scabini & Cigoli,
2012). Gift is seen as the expression of an act of trust that
gives rise to tie; it, as the unconditional principle of exchange,
coexists with debt, which is the mirror opposite of giving,
which involves an imbalance of parents toward their children.
10 SAGE Open
The data in this study highlighted how the similarities between
Italian and Ecuadorian families could be justified considering
that the two groups belong to Latino culture (Badillo, 2006)
and also the permanence of Ecuadorians in Italy. Ecuadorians
can be considered culturally adapted according to the classic
cultural adaptation model. Furthermore, cultural adaptation
could have resulted in Ecuadorians' assimilation into the host
community's way of life. However, this gives the risk of the
partial loss of cultural identity, which was found in the family
routines and practices that were common to the two groups
and that emerged in this research.
Limitations and Future Directions
This work focused on Ecuadorian immigrant women, but it
would be interesting to extend it to other cultural groups. In
addition, this study is centered on women's experiences, by
self-report techniques, and it would be interesting to extend
it to investigating the opinions of male figures about life in
Italy and the previous and present habits of immigrant
fathers. Furthermore, the possibility to implement the par-
ticipants should be enhancing the generalization of findings.
An additional suggestion for future research, given that the
participants in this work had lived in Italy for many years,
would be to investigate a group of Ecuadorian mothers who
had only lived in Italy for a short time. Finally, considering
how integration emerged regarding languages, food, and
religion--typical elements of ethnic identity for foreign
participants--it would be interesting to investigate these
aspects of immigrant families' previous lives in their origin
countries. Furthermore, future research could be designed
with participant observations, to focus on practiced family
rather than only on represented one.
