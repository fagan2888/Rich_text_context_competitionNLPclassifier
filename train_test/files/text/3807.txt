In Interference Patterns Jon Adams seeks to evaluate the past and prospect of
attempts within literary studies to imitate or incorporate elements of science. He looks at
earlier attempts to relate literary analysis to science, especially in Roman Jakobson's
linguistics (1920s-1980s, e.g. 1980, 1985) and in Northrop Frye's metacriticism (1957), but
has been moved especially by the emergence of evolutionary psychology in the 1990s. He
focuses particular attention on E.O. Wilson's claims for the unity of the natural and social
sciences and the humanities and arts (1998) and on Joseph Carroll's Evolution and Literary
Theory (1995).
The subject is timely and important: two already much-heralded books will appear
this season, Edward Slingerland's (2008) What Science Offers the Humanities: Integrating
Body and Culture and Jon Gottschall's (2008) Literature, Science, and a New Humanities.
Alas, Adams's book is neither timely nor important. Timeliness first: a worthy PhD,
written mostly between 2000 and 2002, it needed much more work to become a book even
for an audience of specialists. Published in 2007, it fails to mention nearly all the work in
evolution and literature published over the preceding fourteen years, including books by
Nancy Easterlin and Barbara Riebling (1993), Robert Storey (1996), Brett Cooke (1999,
2002), Joseph Carroll again (2004), David Barash and Nanelle Barash (2005), and The
Literary Animal (2005), edited by Gottschall and D.S. Wilson, as well as the fifty-plus
articles written by Carroll (e.g. 2005, 2007), Cooke (e.g. 1999), Easterlin (e.g. 1993, 1999,
2000, 2001), Gottschall (e.g. 2001, 2003a,b), Scalise Sugiyama (e.g. 1996, 2001a,b,c, 2003,
2005) and myself (e.g. Boyd, 1998, 2001, 2005, 2006), to name only the most prolific in
the field. Characteristically, Adams cites an article by Tony Jackson (2000) critical of
Storey's (1996) Mimesis and the Human Animal, but does not list Storey's book itself in
the bibliography or refer to it except in a brief citation from Jackson. Adams really needed
to do more research, even by 2002, let alone for a book published in 2007.
Importance next. An author writing on this subject surely ought to consider the

major attempts to relate literary to scientific methods, and not just to select material he
happened to have noticed. Why devote a long discussion to the eccentric and issueless
Georges Polti? Why does Adams not mention the Russian formalists of the late 1910s and
1920s (e.g. Shklovsky, 1980), and their attempt to create a scientific approach to literature,
and their recent (1980s onward) descendants in both literature (especially Colin Martindale
and others in the International Society for the Empirical Study of Literature) (e.g.,
Martindale, 1990) and in film (especially David Bordwell and his disciples like John
Anderson, Ed Tan and Murray Smith) (e.g., Bordwell, 2008; Anderson and Fisher, 2005;
Tan, 1996; and Smith, 1995, respectively)? Why does he not do more than just mention the
name of I.A. Richards (1929) in passing? Why not discuss Leo Spitzer's important 1948
linkage of the process of critical reading with the hypothetico-deductive method of science?
If Adams really wished to explore the possibilities of would-be scientific
approaches to literature, he could have chosen, rather than exploring the main past
approaches, to focus exclusively on what he thinks has become or is about to become the
dominant current approach, literary Darwinism. He does give this some prominence--
rightly, I think, because of the promise it shows. But there are at least three major problems
in his treatment.
First, he seems to believe that, where structuralism appeared to offer a means of
uniting knowledge and therefore powerfully shaped literary theory and criticism, but failed,
evolution also promises to unite the knowledge of living things and therefore may take over
the central role structuralism once played in literary theory. Adams seems even to believe
that this change is well under way. Those of us who hope such a change might come would
be delighted if that were the case, but have to acknowledge that although literary studies in
the Americas are in a crisis, few yet feel ready to consider evolution as the best path out of
the mire. Adams seriously misreads the current situation in literary studies.
Second, his attempted critique of the prospects of scientific and especially
evolutionary approaches to literature rests on a woefully simple confusion. E.O. Wilson
claims in Consilience that scientific and humanistic explanation must be consilient, must
take physicalism as their foundation. But the fact that everything is ultimately physics does
not entail, for Wilson, Carroll, or anyone else interested in linking evolution and literature,
that physics is everything. Everything must be compatible with a physical explanation of
the world, but this does not preclude new properties emerging at higher degrees of
organization and interaction: chemistry, life, thought, and art. Why should Adams suppose
that Wilson's work ultimately ousts intentionality when sociobiology depends on
competing and cooperating intentions, or that evolutionary psychology has nothing to do
with minds, or that literary scholars would be remotely interested in consilience at that
imagined cost?
This second flaw is decisive, but a third problem compounds it. Not only does
Adams not know much of the work that has connected evolution and literature, but he
cannot or does not try to imagine what such work might do. He seems to suppose only that
it can collapse out intentionality. In fact it can offer a new poetics, a naturalistic theory of
literature, explaining why we are story-making animals and why we create and comprehend
stories as we do. Or it can offer a new thematics, an examination of the subject matter of
literature that returns literary studies from the narrow focus on race, class or gender, or the

social construction of this or that, to the whole range of human behavior depicted in
literature and explained in the cross-species, cross-cultural and deep-historical perspectives
that evolution makes possible. Or it can show how literature approached in a scientific
spirit can supply qualitative and quantitative data for the understanding of human nature in
specific times and places or across time and place.
Adams objects to a closer link between literature and the sciences especially
because he accepts Richard Rorty's stress on the different questions that different
disciplines ask. But neither consilience nor an evolutionary approach to literature imperils
pluralism. Consilience requires only that all levels of explanation be compatible. A
chemistry that asked only the same questions as physics would no longer be chemistry, but
chemistry incompatible with physics would no longer be science. Neither Freudian
psychoanalysis nor a biology-denying constructivism proves compatible with evolution or
evidence, but within an evolutionary perspective on literature, the latter can be studied from
many different angles, so long as they are compatible with other empirical disciplines.
We can study literature from anthropological, economic, political, religious or
sociological angles, but with evolution's power to explain multilevel selection and the
complex interplay between competition and cooperation, we can explore sociality with far
greater depth and range. Or we can study literature from neurological or psychological
angles, using all the temporal and physical breadth of evolution and all the temporal and
physical resolution of neuroscience. Or we can study literature as literature, as art, with all
the expertise of human readers, scholarship and traditions and where appropriate with all
the power of scientific method. For me personally that offers the greatest challenge and
pleasure of an evolutionary approach to literature: a return to literature as literature and to a
discriminating, evidence-based and consilient pluralism. Such an approach loses nothing
but an indifference to evidence and gains a wide and complex world.
