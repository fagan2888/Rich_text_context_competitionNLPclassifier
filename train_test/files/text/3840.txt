Abstract
The short and long isoforms of the dopamine D2 receptor
(D2S and D2L respectively) are highly expressed in the
striatum. Functional D2 receptors activate an intracellular
signalling pathway that includes a cAMP-independent
route involving Akt/GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3). To
investigate the Akt/GSK3 response to the seldom-studied
D2S receptor, we established a rat D2S receptor-expressing
cell line [HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293/rD2S]. We
found that in HEK-293/rD2S cells, the D2/D3 agonists
bromocriptine and quinpirole significantly induced Akt and
GSK3 phosphorylation, as well as ERK1/2 (extracellular-
signal-regulated kinase 1/2) activation. The D2S receptor-
induced Akt signals were profoundly inhibited by the
internalization blockers monodansyl cadaverine and con-
canavalin A. Activation of the D2S receptor in HEK-293/
rD2S cells appeared to trigger Akt/phospho-Akt transloca-
tion to the cell membrane. In addition to our cell culture
experiments, we studied D2 receptor-dependent Akt in vivo
by systemic administration of the D2/D3 agonist quinpirole.
The results show that quinpirole evoked Akt-Ser473
phosphorylation in the ventral striatum. Furthermore,
intra-accumbens administration of wortmannin, a PI3K
(phosphoinositide 3-kinase) inhibitor, significantly sup-
pressed the quinpirole-evoked behavioural activation.
Overall, we demonstrate that activation of the dopamine
D2S receptor stimulates Akt/GSK3 signalling. In addition, in
vivo Akt activity in the ventral striatum appears to play an
important role in systemic D2/D3 agonist-induced beha-
vioural activation.

INTRODUCTION
The neurotransmitter DA (dopamine) performs essential
physiological functions in the CNS (central nervous system).
Deficits in DA signalling, owing to either over-activation or
dysfunction, lead to major psychiatric and neurological
disorders such as Parkinson's disease, attention deficit
with hypereactivity, Tourett's syndrome, mania/psychosis
and addiction (Iversen and Iversen, 2007; Beaulieu and
Gainetdinov, 2011). DA effects are executed through action
on membrane-bound receptors that belong to a G-protein-
coupled receptor family (Tan et al., 2003). There are two
distinct classes of DA receptors, namely the D1-like (D1 and
D5) and D2-like (D2, D3 and D4) receptors (De Mei et al.,
2009). Compounds which act on the D2-like receptor have
been used clinically to ameliorate symptoms of certain DA-
dependent disorders. Examples include anti-psychotics (D2
antagonist) or medications for treating Parkinson's disease
(D2 and D3 agonists). Understanding the cellular events medi-
ated by DA D2 receptors, especially in the neuroanatomical

context, would not only increase our understanding of the
molecular mechanism of disease, but also aid the development
of novel treatments.
DA D2 receptors are predominantly expressed in the CNS,
both pre-synaptically and post-synaptically (De Mei et al.,
2009). The receptors contain two alternatively spliced
isoforms that differ in 29 amino acids in the region of the
third cytoplasmic loop (Dal et al., 1989; Montmayeur et al.,
1991). The long isoform D2L receptors are more abundant
than short isoform D2S receptors in most brain regions
(Missale et al., 1998). Previous studies using D2 and D2L
receptor knockout mice have demonstrated distinct roles for
D2L and D2S receptors (Wang et al., 2000; Lindgren et al.,
2003). The D2L receptor is considered to be a post-synaptic
receptor in the striatum regulating DARPP-32 (DA- and
cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa), an essential
signal mediator in striatal MSNs (medium spiny neurons). On
the other hand, the D2S receptor acts as pre-synaptic
autoreceptor that negatively regulates the phosphorylation/
activation (Ser40) of tyrosine hydroxylase, a rate-limiting
enzyme in DA synthesis or DA release from the pre-synaptic
nerve terminals (Lindgren et al., 2003). Despite the difference
in pre- compared with post-synaptic localization, treatment
with a D2 agonist resulted in a similar inhibition of adenylate
cyclase activity by both isoforms. This effect is possibly due to
similar extracellular binding domains and conserved coupling
with Gi
/Go
protein. Many Go/Gi
-coupled receptors are known
to activate MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases),
including ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), JNK
(c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38 MAPK (Luo et al., 1998;
Conrad et al., 2000; Beom et al., 2004). ERK phosphorylation/
activation by either D2L or D2S receptor stimulation has been
widely reported, but it appears to be mediated through
different signalling routes. Specifically, D2L receptor activa-
tion recruits c-Src to transactivate the PDGF (platelet-derived
growth factor) receptor and downstream Ras/Raf/MEK
(MAPK/ERK kinase)/ERK signalling cascade, whereas D2S
receptor activation may trigger receptor internalization and
subsequent b-arrestin/dynamin-dependent Raf/MEK/ERK sig-
nalling (Schubert and Duronio, 2001; Kim et al., 2004).
Moreover, previous reports have demonstrated that DA D2
receptors initiate a cAMP-independent pathway by promo-
ting an association of signalling complex containing Akt (also
known as protein kinase B), PP2A (protein phosphatase 2A)
and b-arrestin in the striatum (Beaulieu et al., 2005, 2007).
The discovery of this novel D2 receptor-mediated signalling
pathway is particularly important since modulation of Akt
signal by D2 receptor could provide the cellular mechanism of
psychostimulant-triggered mania/psychosis, as well as the
therapeutic effect of lithium (Jope, 2002; Karam et al., 2010).
Several previous studies using D2 receptor (mostly D2L)-
transfected cell lines or primary neural cultures demonstrated
that D2 activation preferentially promotes Akt phosphoryla-
tion/activation and phosphorylation/inactivation of its sub-
strate GSK (glycogen synthase kinase) 3b (Kihara et al., 2002;
Nair et al., 2003; La Cour et al., 2011). The physiological
significance of this D2-receptor-activated Akt/GSK3 signal-
ling has been extensively discussed with regard to cell survival
or neuroprotection against oxidative stress (Kihara et al.,
2002; Lim et al., 2008; Nair and Olanow, 2008). Considering
that DA D2S receptors act as autoreceptors located in pre-
synaptic DA neurons (Nishi et al., 1997), D2S-receptor-
mediated survival signalling could significantly effect the
viability of DA neurons upon neural insult, including in
pathological processes such as Parkinson's disease and/or
drug addiction. Surprisingly, DA D2S-receptor-mediated Akt/
GSK3 signalling has seldom been explored. In order to
understand the significance of Akt underlying the D2S re-
ceptor and its role in vivo, we asked (i) whether the DA D2S
receptor, expressed in HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293/
rD2S cells, could provoke Akt/GSK3 signalling and (ii) how Akt
signalling in the nucleus accumbens is involved in D2/D3
agonist-induced behavioural activation. We found in trans-
fected HEK-293/rD2S cells that stimulation of the D2S
receptor leads to dual activation of ERK1/2 and Akt/GSK3b
signals. Furthermore, both signals were inhibited by pre-
treatment with an internalization blocker. Importantly, we
demonstrated that behavioural activation evoked by systemic
treatment with the D2/D3 agonist quinpirole could be
effectively suppressed by intra-accumbens administration of
a PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) inhibitor, providing direct
evidence that the D2/D3 receptor positively regulates PI3K/
Akt signalling.

at constant temperature (25°C) and humidity in a control room
under qualified caretakers in the Chang-Gung Animal Core for
at least 1 week before experimentation. Rats were allowed free
access to food and water. All of the experimental procedures
were performed during the light cycle. The ethical guidelines
provided by the Chang-Gung Animal Core and NIH (National
Institutes of Health) were followed throughout the study.
Surgery and intra-accumbens drug
administration
Rats were anaesthetized with ketamine (45 mg/kg, intraper-
itoneally) and xylazine (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and
placed in a stereotaxic holder (David Kopf Model 900). The
guide cannula was made from a 23G needle with 30G stainless
steel tubing stuck inside as a stylet and implanted into
the nucleus accumbens bilaterally. The co-ordinates for the
nucleus accumbens-shell were anterior­posterior +1.7 mm
from bregma, medial­lateral ¡0.7 mm from the midline, and
dorsal­ventral 28.0 mm from the skull (Paxinos and Watson,
1996). Rats were allowed 1 week recovery from cannula
implantation before behavioural measurements. On the day of
the experiment, wortmannin (2.5 mg) in saline/DMSO (50:50)
solution was micro-infused into the nucleus accumbens-shell
at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 2 min driven by a microsyringe
pump (CMS 102). The same volume of vehicle injection served
as a control. After completing each injection, the cannula was
left in place for an additional 2 min to reduce any possible
backflow of the solution along the injection track. Systemic
quinpirole (1 mg/kg) or saline was given 30 min after the
completion of intra-accumbens wortmannin infusion. The
location of the needle tract was histologically verified by Nissl
staining after the termination of the experiment.
Behavioural assessment
The behavioural response to quinpirole, in the presence or
absence of intra-accumbens drug or vehicle pre-treatment, on
Sprague­Dawley rats were evaluated by measuring drug-
evoked locomotor activity and stereotypy. After quinpirole
(1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or saline administration, each
individual rat was tested in an Animal Activity Cage
(30 cm645 cm645 cm; MED Associates) constructed of
opaque plastic walls and four photocells positioned 1 cm
above the floor and spaced evenly along the longitudinal axis
of each chamber. When the animal moved, separate interrup-
tions of photocell beams were detected via an electrical
interface by a computer situated in an adjacent room. Every
5 min, locomotor activity and stereotypy was recorded for a
total session of 3 h. Photo-beam interruptions with a duration
of less than 0.5 s were excluded (Chen and Chen, 2005).
Cell culture and stable transfection
HEK-293 cells were maintained at 37°C in MEM (minimum
essential medium) containing 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum),
100 i.u./ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. At 1 day
before the transfection, HEK-293 cells were plated on 60 mm
dishes at a density of 2.56106 cells/cm2 in growth medium
without antibiotics. pcDNA3 plasmid (4 mg) containing the
coding region of the rat D2S receptor construct was
incubated with 10 ml of LipofectamineTM 2000 (Gibco) in a
total volume of 250 ml of serum-free MEM for 20 min at
room temperature (25°C). After washing gently three times
with MEM, 4 ml of serum-free MEM was added. The complex
was then pipetted into each well containing cells and
medium, and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2
for 5 h. Next,
the cells were passed at 1:10 into fresh selective medium in
100 mm dishes and maintained in 800 mg/ml geneticin
(G418)-containing culture medium. Cultured cells were
changed to fresh medium twice a week to test transgene
expression for 6 weeks. For the selected HEK-293/rD2S clone,
the 8­15th generations were used in the experiments.
Dopamine D2S receptor saturation binding
Cells were resuspended in a D2-binding buffer [50 mM Tris
base, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2
and 1 mM MgCl2
(pH 7.4)] and homogenized on ice. Cell membranes were
pelleted by centrifugation (34000 g for 30 min at 4°C) and
resuspended by homogenization on ice in the same binding
buffer. Binding assays were carried out by mixing 50 mg
of membrane protein with various concentrations of
[3H]racropride (0.39, 0.78, 1.56, 3.13, 6.25 and 12.5 nM) in
binding buffer with or without (2)sulpride (10 mM)
in triplicate. After incubation at 37°C for 30 min, protein
was harvested on to glass-fibre filters (Whatmann GF/C)
using a combicell harvester (Harvard PhD). Bound radioactiv-
ity was detected by a liquid scintillation counter with
approximately 50% counting efficiency (Parkard).
Western blot analysis
HEK-293/rD2S cells or ventral striatal tissues were lysed with
heated 1% SDS. Extracts were sonicated, denatured (100°C
for 5 min) and centrifuged, after which they were separated
on a 10% acrylamide gel. After electrophoresis (SDS/PAGE),
proteins were transferred on to a PVDF membrane (Millipore).
Membranes were incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer [TBS
(20 mM Tris base and 137 mM NaCl, pH 7.6), 0.1% Tween 20
and 5% non-fat dried skimmed milk] at room temperature,
washed three times with TBS-T (TBS with 0.1% Tween 20) for
10 min and probed with the designated primary antibodies
(1:1000 in TBS-T buffer) at 4°C overnight. After washing three
times each for 10 min, the proteins were probed with HRP
(horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies
(1:2000 anti-rabbit anti-mouse-HRP in TBS-T) at room
temperature for another 1 h. The membranes were then
washed three times each for 10 min and phosphorylated
proteins were detected by ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence;
GE Healthcare). The b-actin signal served as protein-loading
control. Quantitative results are calculated first as the ratio

relative to b-actin and then converted into a percentage of
the corresponding vehicle control.
Immunoprecipitation
After drug treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS to
remove the culture medium and 150 ml of ice-cold
immunoprecipitation buffer [0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mM
Tris/HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM EGTA (pH
7.4)] to lyse cells. After complete lysis for 1 h, the insoluble
proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 34000 g for
30 min at 4°C. The soluble proteins were then pre-cleaned
with Protein G beads (Millipore) for 90 min at 4°C, and then
incubated with c-tubulin antibody (1:250 dilution) overnight
followed by incubation with Protein G beads for another
90 min. After centrifugation (6000 g for 30 min at 4°C), re-
suspended pellets were separated by SDS/PAGE and subjected
to Western blot analysis.
Immunofluorescence
To monitor Akt translocation, HEK-293/rD2S cells were plated
on poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips at a density of 16105 cells/
cm2 in a six-well plate and serum-starved overnight (16 h).
Cells were then activated with 10 mM bromocriptine for 0­
15 min. Drug stimulation was ended by washing with 2­3 ml
of ice-cold PBS, then cells were fixed using freshly prepared
ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were then
washed three times with PBS (also used for the following
washing and incubation steps) each for 3 min, and permea-
bilized using methanol for 10 min at 220°C. Coverslips were
then incubated in a blocking buffer (5% non-fat dried skimmed
milk in PBS) for 30 min, probed with anti-Akt (1:100 dilution in
blocking buffer), anti-phospho-Akt-Ser473 (1:200 dilution) or
anti-c-tubulin (1:200 dilution) antibodies overnight at 4°C,
washed three times for 5 min each and incubated with Cy3
(indocarbocyanine)- and Alexa FluorH 488-conjugated anti-
goat-FITC secondary antibody (1:100 dilution) for 1 h at room
temperature. After probing, coverslips were washed three times
for 5 min each, and counterstained with DAPI (49,6-diamidino-
2-phenylindole; Roche) for 5 min at room temperature.
Coverslips were then washed with PBS-T (PBS containing
0.1% Tween 20), and mounted on to slides embedded in 3% n-
propyl gallate and 50% glycerol in PBS. The images were
monitored using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus).
Statistical analysis
Data were analysed with the program GraphPad Prism. Results
are expressed as means¡S.E.M. Time- and dose-dependent
studies were analysed by one-way ANOVA followed by the
post-hoc Dunnett's multiple comparison test. The behavioural
study was analysed by either one-way ANOVA followed by the
post-hoc Dunnett's multiple comparison test or two-way
ANOVA followed by the post-hoc Bonferroni test. The level of
statistical significance was set at P,0.05.
RESULTS
D2S receptor-mediated Akt/GSK signalling in
HEK-293/rD2S cells
The expression of the D2S receptor in the HEK-293/rD2S
clone was determined by saturation binding using
[3H]raclopride as the radioligand and non-specific binding
defined by sulpride. The resulting Bmax
, determined by non-
linear regression, was 2.02¡0.18 pmol/mg of membrane
protein and Kd
value was 3.00¡0.83 nM, which is compar-
able with in vivo D2 receptor binding affinity (Chen et al.,
1999). When HEK-293/rD2S cells were exposed to the D2
receptor agonist bromocriptine, a clear Akt phosphorylation/
activation at Ser473 [F (6,42)53.78, P,0.01] and Thr308
residues was observed [F (6,21)54.63, P,0.01]. Among the
doses tested, it seems a plateau phase is reached at 10 nM in
both Akt-Ser473 and Akt-Thr308; however, statistical signifi-
cance is achieved at higher doses (10­100 mM). Therefore,
10 mM bromocriptine was used for the time-dependent
studies and there appears to be a bell-shape time profile
[F (5,24)57.66, P,0.001 for Ser473 and F (5,18)55.66, P,0.01
for Thr308] (Figure 1). Since Akt-Thr308 phosphorylation is
downstream from PI3K/PDK1/2 (phosphoinositide-dependent
kinase 1/2)-dependent signalling that also may induce
Akt translocation to the cell membrane (Alessi and Downes,
1998; Belham et al., 1999; Martelli et al., 1999), we used
fluorescence microscopy to examine Akt localization after
D2S receptor stimulation. As shown in Figure 2, Akt and
phospho-Akt are predominantly distributed in a nuclear/
perinuclear position in HEK-293/rD2S cells and appear to
aggregate in the centrosomes, a structure easily detected by
labelling with an anti-c-tubulin antibody (Figures 2A and 2B).
After treatment with 10 mM bromocriptine, a membrane-like
immunostaining of both Akt and phospho-Akt-Ser473
appeared, possibly in a cell­cell contact region.
Interestingly, activation of D2S receptor with bromocriptine
did not affect the portion of aggregated Akt/phospho-Akt in
centrosomes. To examine whether Akt physically aggregates
with c-tubulin, we performed immunoprecipitation followed
by Western blot analysis. The results show that the Akt signal
can be clearly visualized in anti-c-tubulin-pelleted HEK-293/
rD2S homogenates (Figure 2C). In addition, activation of the
D2S receptor by bromocriptine (10 mM) also induced
downstream GSKa-Ser21 [F (5,19)55.22, P,0.01) and GSKb-
Ser9 [F (5,16)58.12, P,0.001] phosphorylation in HEK-293/
rD2S cells along a similar time course (Figure 3).
D2S-receptor-mediated MAPK signalling in
HEK-293/rD2S cells
As shown in Figure 4, bromocriptine (10 mM) induced ERK1/2
phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner in HEK-293/
rD2S cells. This time-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation could

be verified using another D2/D3 agonist quinpirole. Comparing
the activation pattern of bromocriptine and quinpirole, it
appeared that both drugs evoked a quick and transient ERK1
activation [F (5,17)54.30, P,0.05 for bromocriptine;
F (5,12)54.62, P,0.05 for quinpirole], but a prolonged ERK2
activation [F (5,17)54.13, P,0.05 for bromocriptine;
F (5,17)56.89, P,0.01 for quinpirole] (Figure 4).
Signal cross-talk and receptor internalization in
D2S-receptor-mediated Akt and ERK1/2
signalling
Previous studies have reported that DA D2-receptor-evoked Akt
and ERK1/2 phosphorylation/activation both require protein
interaction with b-arrestin (Kim et al., 2004; Beaulieu et al.,
2005), implying that receptor internalization may participate in
this cellular signalling. To validate if D2S receptor internaliza-
tion would be a pre-requisite to trigger Akt and ERK1/2
activation, and to explore if Akt/GSK can cross-talk with ERK1/2
after D2S receptor activation, we pre-treated HEK-293/rD2S
cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 mM) or MEK inhi-
bitor PD98059 (0.5 mM), and MDC (30 mM) to prevent clathrin
association or ConA (250 mg/ml) to block receptor clustering.
The doses used were on the basis of previous literature (Woo
et al., 2006) as well as our pilot study (Supplementary Figure S1
at http://www.asnneuro.org/an/004/an004e098add.htm) to de-
monstrate the effectiveness in HEK-293/rD2S cells. Except for
PD98059 which reduced phospho-ERK2 but not the phospho-
ERK1 signal, the inhibitors alone did not affect the basal

Figure 2 The subcellular distribution of Akt and phospho-Akt after D2S receptor stimulation in HEK-293/rD2S cells
Cells were starved for 16 h followed by immunofluorescent detection. (A) Total Akt was detected by FITC-labelled (green) anti-Akt
antibody (a, c and d) and the centrosomes were recognized by rhodamine-labelled (red) anti-c-tubulin antibody (b). (B) Phospho-Akt
was stained with Alexa FluorH 488-labelled (green) anti-phospho-Akt-Ser473 antibody (e and i) and Cy3-labelled (red) anti-c-tubulin
antibody (f and j). The corresponding DAPI stain (blue; g and k) and merged images (e, f and g, and i, j and k) are shown in h and l
respectively. Immunofluorescent images reveal that both Akt (A) and phospho-Akt (B) are mainly distributed in a nuclear/perinuclear
position of HEK-293/rD2S cells and are co-localized with the centrosomes (arrowheads) in both control (a­c and e­h) and
bromocriptine-treated (d and i) groups. After incubation with bromocriptine (10 mM) for 15 min (d and i­l), a membrane-like
immunostain of both Akt and phospho-Akt appears (arrows), suggesting that Akt translocates on to the cell­cell contact sites.

phospho-Akt-Ser473 and phospho-ERK1/2 signals (results not
shown). The results show that LY294002 and PD98059
significantly inhibit bromocriptine-induced phospho-Akt-
Ser473 (Figure 5A) and phospho-ERK1/2 (Figure 5B) respectively
in HEK-293/rD2S cells. Pre-treatment with LY294002 did not
effect the D2S-evoked phospho-ERK1/2 signal, similarly pre-
treatment with PD98059 did not effect the D2S-induced
phospho-Akt-Ser473 signal (Figure 5). On the other hand,
evidence was found for the suppression of D2S-induced
phospho-Akt-Ser473 by treatment with MDC and ConA
(Figure 5A), as well as phospho-ERK1/2 signals by ConA
(Figure 5B), indicating that the D2S-mediated Akt and ERK1/2
signals are mostly dependent on receptor internalization.
Finally, pre-treatment with the D2 receptor antagonist
raclopride significantly suppressed the bromocriptine- induced
Akt-Ser473 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, confirming a selective
D2S receptor effect (Figure 5).
Systemic quinpirole administration evoked Akt-
Ser473 phosphorylation in the ventral striatum
In order to test whether the DA D2/D3 agonist quinpirole
would initiate a similar Akt/GSK3 signalling in vivo, in
particular in the ventral striatum, animals were systemically
treated with 1 mg of quinpirole/kg followed by biochemical
analyses at various post-drug treatment times. As shown in
Figure 6, systemic quinpirole significantly induced Akt-Ser473
phosphorylation in the ventral striatum 30 min to 1 h after
drug treatment with a return to near basal levels after 2­3 h
[F (4,10)533.12, P,0.001].
Effect of intra-accumbal PI3K and GSK3
inhibitor on quinpirole-induced behavioural
activation
To further explore the role of nucleus accumbens Akt signalling
in DA D2/D3 agonist quinpirole-induced behavioural activation,
the selective PI3K inhibitor wortmannin was delivered into the
nucleus accumbens-shell 30 min before systemic quinpirole
(1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) injection. The results of one-way
ANOVA analyses show that 1 mg of quinpirole/kg induced both
horizontal locomotor activity [F (1,36)53.54, P,0.001] and
stereotypy [F (1,36)52.61, P,0.001] in experimental rats with
onset at approximately 60­75 min post-treatment (Figure 7).
Pre-treatment with intra-accumbens wortmannin significantly
suppressed the systemic quinpirole-evoked behavioural activa-
tion as measured by both locomotor activity [main effect of
treatment; F (3,576)542.39, P,0.0001] and overall time6
treatment [F (105,576)51.96, P,0.0001], and stereotypy [main
effect of treatment; F (3,576)589.75, P,0.0001] and overall
time6treatment [F (105,576)51.44, P,0.01]. It was noted that
wortmannin alone did not alter basal activity in experimental
animals. Those animals displayed normal spontaneous beha-
viours, similar to systemic saline-challenged control animals.

DISCUSSION
The present study provides an examination of DA D2-
receptor-regulated Akt signalling both in vivo and in vitro.
We first demonstrated that the D2S receptor positively
regulates Akt and GSK3 phosphorylation mainly through an
internalization mechanism in HEK-293/rD2S cells.
Activation of D2S receptors appears to evoke a membrane
form of Akt and phospho-Akt signal possibly at sites of cell­
cell contact, suggesting a functional significance. Although
D2S stimulation also induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in
HEK-293/rD2S cells, there does not appear to be signal
cross-talk between ERK1/2 and Akt/GSK3. Interestingly, we
found that systemic quinpirole administration in rats not
only induced activation of locomotion and stereotypy, but
enhanced Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation/activation in the
ventral striatum. When PI3K inhibitor was administered
specifically to the nucleus accumbens-shell, systemic
quinpirole-induced behavioural activation was significantly
suppressed. Both in vitro and in vivo results from the
present study suggest a positive role of the DA D2 receptor
in Akt/PKB activation.
DA D2 receptors are differentially spliced to create two
isoforms differing by 29 amino acids in the 3rd intracellular
domain, namely the D2L and D2S receptors. Specific ablation
of D2L receptor in D2L2/2 mice, thereby preserving the D2S
receptor, results in a D2-agonist-mediated decrease in
tyrosine hydroxylase Ser40 phosphorylation in the substantia
nigra, demonstrating a pre-synaptic nature of D2S auto-
receptor (Lindgren et al., 2003). It is of note that D2L-
knockout mice retain locomotor and reward response to
cocaine (Welter et al., 2007), suggesting that D2S-receptor-
mediated intracellular events are critical in determining the
behavioural phenotypes of drug addiction. Therefore it is
important to explore D2S-receptor-mediated signalling, in
particular the unexamined Akt/GSK3 pathway that was
reported to be coupled with the D2L receptor and plays an
essential role in psychiatric disorders (Nair and Olanow, 2008;
Beaulieu et al., 2009; La Cour et al., 2011). The present study
clearly demonstrates that D2S receptor activation could
dually induce ERK1/2 and Akt/GSK3 phosphorylation, wherein
a significant amount of bromocriptine-induced phospho-Akt-
Ser473 could be reduced by the internalization blockers MDC,
which prevents clathrin association (Ray and Samanta, 1996),
or ConA, which blocks receptor clustering (Pippig et al.,
1995). Comparing the D2S with the D2L isoform, the D2S
receptor appears to activate ERK1/2 phosphorylation via
clathrin-mediated endocytosis in a b-arrestin- and dynamin-
dependent manner (Kim et al., 2004). On the other hand, D2L-
evoked ERK1/2 signalling requires PDGF receptor and/or EGF
(epidermal growth factor) receptor transactivation, inde-
pendent of b-arrestin-mediated D2L receptor internalization
(Kim et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2005). Our result that D2S-
induced ERK1/2 activity could be partly suppressed by ConA is
comparable with the observation by Kim et al. (2004) but, to
some degree, in contrast with a report by Quan et al. (2008).
In the latter study, the authors exclude the role of b-arrestin,
but show Gi2
protein involvement in D2S-mediated ERK
activation. Our results reveal the existence of both inter-
nalization-dependent (40% inhibition by ConA but no
inhibition by MDC) and -independent pathways underlying

D2S-receptor-mediated ERK1/2 signalling, suggesting that
the D2S receptor modulates ERK via multiple pathways.
Expression of different signal mediators or transducers in
various cell lines might account for the apparent discrepancy
between our present study and the study by Quan et al.
(2008). For example, Wang et al. (2005) reported D2L-
receptor-activated ERK via transactivation of EGF receptor in
NS20Y neuroblastoma, but via transactivation of PDGF
receptor in HEK-293 cells.
Numerous reports have shown that DA D2/D3-receptor-
mediated Akt/GSK3 activation plays a cytoprotective role,
through either counteracting pro-apoptotic substrates, such
as FKHR (forkhead in rhabdosarcoma), Bad or caspase 9, or
up-regulating cytoprotective transcription factors, such as
Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2) or CREB
(cAMP-response-element-binding protein) (Chen et al.,
2008; Lim et al., 2008; Nair and Olanow, 2008). In the
present study, we observed both bromocriptine and
quinpirole induce Akt and GSK3a/b phosphorylation in
HEK-293/rD2S cells, suggesting that D2S-receptor-mediated
Akt activation/GSK3 inactivation could protect DA neurons.
Since the cytoprotective Akt/GSK signal could transfer into
the nucleus to control transcription regulation (Castellino
and Durden, 2007), it is possible that somatodendritic D2S-
induced nuclear phospho-Akt would enhance the expression
of Nrf2 or CREB and hence initiate an anti-oxidative signal
cascade against the DA neural insult. Furthermore, the
observation that bromocriptine provoked Akt/phospho-Akt
translocation to the cell membrane not only relates to a
similar observation regarding D2L receptor activation (Nair
et al., 2003), but also demonstrates that the D2S receptor
could initiate a PI3K-dependent Akt/GSK3 signal since
activation of PI3K would recruit Akt to the plasma
membrane (Alessi et al., 1997). To date, the subcellular
localization of Akt seems to be different among various cell
lines (Nair et al., 2003; Wang and Brattain, 2006), but the
underlying mechanism for this difference is not known. The
results of the present study also revealed that endogenous
Akt aggregated in the centrosomes and was found to
diffusely stain nucleus and cytoplasm in HEK-293/rD2S
cells. It was reported that phospho-Akt localizes to the
centrosomes in HEK-293 and HeLa cells, and is responsible
for GSK-3 phosphorylation at the centrosome during
mitosis (Wakefield et al., 2003). Furthermore, during early
development of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo, Akt
is able to regulate centrosome migration and spindle
orientation (Buttrick et al., 2008). Whether D2S-receptor-
mobilized Akt would participate in mitosis requires further
investigation.
In contrast with most in vitro observations that the D2
receptor positively regulates Akt and GSK phosphorylation,
some studies have indicated that in vivo D2-like receptor
(D2/D3) activation appears to cause an inhibition of Akt
and GSK3 phosphorylation, hence resulting in an activation
of GSK3 activity (Beaulieu et al., 2005, 2007). This occurs in
particular after prolonged stimulation by non-selective DA
receptor agonists such as amphetamine or apomorphine. In
the present study, we attempt to circumvent the profound
systemic effect of signal blockers by locally injecting PI3K
inhibitor into the nucleus accumbens-shell before systemic
challenge with quinpirole. The results demonstrate that
inhibition of Akt activity in the nucleus accumbens-shell
totally suppressed the D2/D3-agonist-induced behavioural
effect. This result can be confirmed by biochemical analyses,
i.e. Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation increased in the ventral
striatum after quinpirole injection, indicating a similar
regulation of in vivo D2-like receptors on the Akt signal as
observed in vitro. We speculate that the discrepancy
between the results of the present study and Beaulieu
et al. (2005, 2007) could possibly be due to a difference in
the tissues analysed, i.e. we used ventral striatum (contain-
ing D2S/D2L and D3) whereas Beaulieu et al. used whole
striatum (D2L dominant). Secondly, we systemically treated
rat with a specific D2 agonist, but added Akt blocker locally
into nucleus accumbens, whereas Beaulieu et al. analysed
their samples with a non-selective amphetamine or
apomorphine injection. In a recent report, METH (meth-
amphetamine) challenge in METH-sensitized animals
resulted in an enhanced phospho-Akt response in the
striatum (Pogorelov et al., 2011), indicating a more dynamic
nature of Akt regulation upon indirect or non-specific DA
agonist treatment.
In conclusion, in the present paper we report that DA D2S
receptors are functionally associated with Akt/GSK signal-
ling and require receptor internalization for this activation.
This finding suggests that D2S receptors function as a pre-
synaptic autoreceptor localized in both nerve terminals and

phosphorylation
Animals were systemically injected with quinpirole (1 mg/kg) or saline
(vehicle) and killed at designated times. The levels of Akt-Ser473
phosphorylation in the ventral striatum were quantified by Western blotting.
Since time-matched vehicle-treated controls show no difference, data were
pooled (n54 per group) and are presented as means¡S.E.M. from four
independent experiments. *P,0.001 compared with the vehicle control.

soma which offers protection to the DA neurons. Since the
extracellular ligand-binding domains are quite similar
between D2S and D2L receptors, it is difficult to determine
the pre-synaptic role in vivo. Our in vivo data indicates
that D2-like receptor-mediated Akt signalling is similar to
prior in vitro studies, and is consistent with behavioural
observations using drug manipulation in the nucleus
accumbens-shell. Although we conclude that D2/D3 recep-
tor activation leads to GSK3 inactivation in the ventral
striatum, the behavioural impact of local modulation of the
Akt/GSK3 response in the nucleus accumbens is likely to be
quite different from the behavioural outcome generated
from modulating the whole motor and/or rewarding
circuitry. Conditional knockout or overexpression of D2
receptor or Akt/GSK3 in specific brain regions should help
resolve this discrepancy.
