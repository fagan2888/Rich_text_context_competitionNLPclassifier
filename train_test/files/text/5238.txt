Abstract: The arms race between deception and detection is likely to have played out
between individuals in different status hierarchies, with low-status individuals more likely
to be deceivers and high-status individuals more likely to be detectors than the other way
around. Memory and its distortion may be temporarily employed first to keep truthful
information away from both self and others and later to retrieve accurate information to
benefit the self. Using a dual-retrieval paradigm, we tested the hypothesis that people are
likely to deceive themselves to better deceive high- rather than equal-status others. College
student participants were explicitly instructed (Study 1 and 2) or induced (Study 3) to
deceive either a high-status teacher or an equal-status fellow student. When interacting with
the high- but not equal-status target, participants in three studies genuinely remembered
fewer previously studied items than they did on a second memory test alone without the
deceiving target. The results support the view that self-deception responds to status
hierarchy that registers probabilities of deception detection such that people are more likely
to self-deceive high- rather than equal-status others.

Introduction
Trivers (1976) introduced his theory of self-deception over three decades ago.
According to his theory, individuals deceive themselves to better deceive others by placing
truthful information in the unconscious while consciously presenting false information to
others as well as the self without leaving cues to be detected of deception. This
evolutionary theory has since been elaborated (Alexander, 1987; Trivers, 1985, 2000) and
expanded (von Hippel and Trivers, 2011) but has not been empirically tested, in part
Deceiving yourself

because the theory does not specify a mechanism by which to place information in the
unconscious or ways to falsify that such placement occurs. It is also unclear about the
adaptive value of keeping truthful information from the self (Leeuwen, 2007), and it is
difficult to separate deception from self-deception when inferred mainly from the self-
serving outcome but not other conditions of deception. The purpose of the present study
was to provide the first empirical test of Trivers' theory by addressing the aforementioned
issues.
Specifically, we propose a dual-retrieval system to operationalize and empirically
test self-deception within Trivers' theoretical framework. The dual-retrieval system that
allows an individual to retrieve truthful information twice--once under the motivation to
deceive and once after deception is achieved--resolves the potential controversy about the
adaptiveness of keeping truthful information from the self (Leeuwen, 2007). We propose
that, by keeping fitness-enhancing information away from both self and others, self-
deception as an adaptation must cease to operate in most instances once the goal of
deception has been achieved. Truthful information that once has been kept from both self
and others will then be retrieved to benefit the self. Such information manipulation makes
memory likely to have been co-opted to execute self-deception. Memory research thus
provides a good paradigm within which to test hypotheses about self-deception. Although
encoding may also be used (von Hippel and Trivers, 2011), especially in intra-individual
self-deception, in this paper we focus on retrieval in inter-individual or social interactional
contexts.
We also set conditions under which self-deception is deemed more likely than
deception. Because the more costly self-deception evolved to escape detection, it must
respond to social conditions that register the probability of deception detection such that
people should self-deceive when they sense high rather than low probabilities of detection.
The social status of the deceived, relative to that of the deceiver, represents one of the
detection-registering conditions that should affect the likelihood and activation of self-
deception. We argue that the evolutionary "arms race" between deception and deception
detection is more likely to have played out between the low-status individuals as deceivers
and high-status individuals as detectors rather than the other way around and is likely to
lead to people deceiving themselves to deceive high- rather than low- or equal-status
others. Whereas we focus on status as an example of increased detection probability, other
variables such as the number of targets to be deceived also affect the probability of
detection. Because it is generally easier to deceive one rather than multiple targets, high-
status individuals are more likely to self-deceive the public or groups of individuals than
single individuals. In this paper, we focus on social status, but not number of deceiving
targets or others, as a condition in individual but not group deception.
The arms race between low-status deceivers and high-status detectors
Humans and other primates live in hierarchical social groups where status
influences resource distribution (Boehm, 1999; Wright, 1994). High-status individuals who
attained their position either by force or social intelligence (Ellis, 1995; Nettle, 2003) have
more resources than low-status individuals and have the power to punish the latter for rule
violations (Cummins, 1999, 2005). Low-status individuals who are under constant
Deceiving yourself
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -637-
surveillance often attempt to hide resources from high-status individuals (Whiten and
Byrne, 1988). In this case, low-status individuals should be more motivated to deceive,
whereas high-status individuals should be more motivated to detect deception. High-status
individuals have more honest means (through force or by changing the rules) to acquire
resources than do low-status individuals. High-status individuals also have more
resources--including information leading to the deception detection--and the means to
punish deceivers. In contrast, low-status individuals are more limited detectors who may
face revenge for detecting deception. Detecting deception does not enhance fitness if the
detector is unable to punish but may be retaliated by the deceiver. There is thus more
pressure to perfect deception when one has the need to deceive but also faces increased
chances to be caught and punished. The same pressure to better deceive is much reduced
when one expects little punishment from the detector if caught deceiving or has other
honest means to pursue the same fitness gains. Social status may therefore shift selection
pressure to favor low-status individuals over high-status individuals as fearful deceivers
and the high-status individuals over low-status individuals as vigilant detectors. Thus,
Trivers' arms race between deception and detection is likely to have played out between
low-status deceivers and high-status detectors, leading to people deceiving themselves to
better deceive high- rather than low- or equal-status others.
Animal research shows that subordinates spend time hiding desirable resources or
rule violations from dominant peers who police the group (Byrne and Whiten, 1992;
Mitchell, 1999). The young European male kestrel grows female-like plumage to avoid
aggressive dominant older males and increase their chance of mating during the breeding
season (Hakkarainen, Korpimäki, Huhta, and Palokangas, 1993). Ravens (Bugnyar and
Kotrschal, 2004) and pigs (Held, Mendl, Devereux, and Byrne, 2002) take detours from
food sources to mislead high-status conspecifics. Subordinate monkeys escorted their
superiors far away from the food source, demonstrating a conspicuous and elaborate
deceptive ploy (Amici, Call, and Aureli, 2009; Ducoing and Thierry, 2003). Low-status
chimpanzees only retrieved their food when it would be unseen by a high-status competitor
(Hare, Call, Agnetta, and Tomasello, 2000) or a human experimenter (Hare, Call, and
Tomasello, 2006), whereas high-status chimpanzees took food openly (Hare et al., 2006).
Field observations demonstrate social status-regulated deception and detection in more
detail. In one case, a subordinate chimpanzee misled a dominant member away from where
it had hidden a banana. Wary of deception, the high-status chimp did not go far. Later,
when the subordinate retrieved the banana from its hiding place, the dominant chimp
attacked (Whiten and Byrne, 1988). Relying on status, prestige, or violence in lieu of
deception, high-status animals are able to disperse, drive away, or attack subordinates to
obtain what they want (Wright, 1994). They also detect, prevent, and punish rule-breaking
behaviors of low-ranking deceivers (Clutton-Brock and Parker, 1995) who, with no option
of aggression or group alliance, are constantly pressured to improve their deceptive ploys.
Evidence in humans is found in hierarchical social relations. The supervisor-
subordinate relationship is an example. Sales staff in retail stores and supermarkets did not
report customer complaints to their supervisors and restaurant servers hid incorrect orders
from their managers (Harris and Ogbonna, 2010; Payne, 2008). On the other hand,
workplace superiors were vigilant toward potential subordinates deceit (Wintrobe and
Deceiving yourself
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -638-
Breton, 1986). In an experiment using the Wason selection task, participants assigned a
supervisor role were better able to detect cheaters than participants who played
subordinates (Manktelow and Over, 1991). Once within a status hierarchy, such as the
employer-employee setting, human beings, like other animals, may be driven by the
additional motivation consistent with status-regulated deception and detection. Various
effective management programs (e.g., self-managed work groups; Manz and Sims, 1993)
aim to break away from this mindset by reducing hierarchical elements of the work
environment to improve labor relations and productivity (Kirkman and Rosen, 1999). The
state-citizen relationship provides another example in which the higher-level state employs
law enforcement (i.e., detection) and correctional systems (i.e., punishment) to control
deception by its citizens (e.g., committing and hiding crimes, including cheating on taxes).
Corruption provides another example that can happen when lower-ranking individuals or
institutions choose not to report the misdeeds of the higher-ups for fear of retribution. In
each of these hierarchical relationships, the higher level of the hierarchy is vigilant about
detecting deception from the lower level, thereby exerting pressure on subordinates to
improve deception strategies, meeting Trivers's hypotheses of self-deception.
Memory helps to execute self-deception
According to Trivers (2000), a blatant deceiver keeps both true and false
information in the conscious mind but presents only falsehoods to others. In doing so, the
deceiver may leave clues about the truth due to its conscious access. A self-deceiver keeps
only false information in consciousness. Lying to others and to the self at the same time,
the self-deceiver thus leaves no clues about the truth retained in the unconscious mind
(Trivers, 2000). This proposed mechanism has raised questions about the adaptiveness of
self-deception because, by concealing information from others, the deceiver cannot access
information to benefit him or herself (Leeuwen, 2007). To address this concern, we propose
a dual-retrieval memory process in which the self-deceiver first fails to retrieve information
when motivated to deceive others and, after deception has been achieved, retrieves
information to benefit him or herself. The difference between the two retrievals in the self-
serving direction suggests self-deception.
Specifically, the dual-retrieval paradigm offers a self-deceiver two chances to
retrieve (or distort) encoded information assumed to be fitness enhancing given the
motivation to keep it from the deceived. The first retrieval normally takes place in the
presence of the deceived. The second retrieval often (but not always) takes place without
the deceived after a successful deception. For example, in front of a high-status food
seeker, a low-status food hider forgets completely or partially where he/she hides food.
After the food seeker leaves, the food hider remembers where the food is. In the first
retrieval, the deceiver honestly distorts, partially retrieves, or fails to retrieve encoded
information due to the motivation to deceive and to escape detection. In the second
retrieval (when motivation changes from hiding to seeking food), the deceiver retrieves the
true or full information to achieve fitness gains. Thus, the dual-retrieval paradigm addresses
the issue of adaptiveness and offers a way to verify self-deception, which is discrepancy
between the two retrievals.
Memory serves well to execute self-deception because its performance is subject to
Deceiving yourself
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -639-
the influence of goals and motivations. When motivated to survive, people memorize items
encoded in survival-related situations better than other situations (Nairne, Pandeirada, and
Thompson, 2008). In directed forgetting, participants show better recall of the items they
are instructed to remember compared to items they are asked to forget (Bjork and Bjork,
1996); however, even though some of the forgetting items cannot be consciously retrieved,
they have been encoded and can be probed by implicit memory tests (David and Brown,
2003). Thus, the mind suppresses unneeded information from memory. In hindsight bias,
people unintentionally modify their memories of past experience to be consistent with
current life goals (Leary, 1981; Pieters, Baumgartner, and Bagozzi, 2006). Such memory
modifications or distortions are due to processes of retrieval rather than encoding or storage
(Hasher, Attig, and Alba, 1981). These evidences suggest that retrieval of encoded
materials respond to the context defined by the specific goals and motivations that
influence memory at the time. The dual-retrieval paradigm, therefore, can operationalize
Trivers's self-deception by comparing two memories driven by two different motivations.
Experimental operations and the present study
The dual-memory system provides a general approach by which to conduct research
on self-deception. The central focus of this approach is to obtain self-serving
inconsistencies between two memories, one of which is motivated by deception and the
other of which is free from deceptive motives. The present paper reports four studies that
all used the same dual-retrieval paradigm. Participants were assigned to one of two
conditions: deceiving a high-status target or deceiving an equal-status target. Our
hypothesis was that the status differential would make the first group self-deceive the high-
status target and would make the second group (openly) deceive the equal-status target. The
dual-retrieval paradigm consists of encoding and the first and second retrieval. In the
encoding stage, participants learned items for an upcoming vocabulary or knowledge
contest. In the first retrieval stage when participants were instructed or induced to deceive
either a high-status (e.g., a teacher) or an equal-status target (e.g., a fellow student), they
were asked to recognize or recall the items they had previously seen. In the second
retrieval, which was conducted purely as a memory test for monetary incentives,
participants remembered the items alone without the deceiving target. The first retrieval
was motivated by deception. The second retrieval was free from deception. The two
retrievals were compared. Self-deception was verified by more distorted memories in the
first compared to the second retrieval that was self-serving.
Study 1
In the first two studies, participants were instructed to lie to a high- or equal-status
target. This creates constant deception motivation for all participants, eliminating the
suspicion that some participants may and some may not try to deceive. As perfect
deception, self-deception is unconscious or is conscious of being honest. If memory co-opts
by distorting itself to enable such perfect deception to escape detection, participants under
the high-status condition were expected to show more memory loss or distortion in the first
recognition when they were instructed to lie compared to the second recognition when they
Deceiving yourself

were not asked to lie, whereas participants lying to an equal-status target should experience
little or no memory difference between the first and second recognition.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Forty-four college students (Mean age = 20.20, SD = 1.69; 22 males) from a
university in southern China were recruited to take part in an ostensible Chinese vocabulary
test for monetary awards.
Design and procedure
The design was a 2 (deceiving target: high- vs. equal-status) × 2 (recognition: first
vs. second) mixed design. Participants were randomly assigned into one of two
experimental groups: high-status deception group (n = 22), where participants were asked
to lie to a teacher, and equal-status deception group (n = 22), where participants were asked
to lie to a fellow student. Participants took two recognition tests after an encoding stage
where they learned Chinese words. In the first recognition test, participants were instructed
to recognize words they had seen and, at the same time, to report the opposite to the high-
or equal-status target. Specifically, if participants remembered to have seen or not to have
seen a word, they would need to indicate so and, at the same time, need to lie to the target
by communicating the opposite of the word recognition result. In the second recognition,
participants were asked to recognize the words alone for monetary incentives. Moderate
monetary awards were promised and later given to participants for lying to the target.
Encoding. Participants were told to compete in a Chinese vocabulary contest by
making a sentence for each word presented to them and, before the test, they had a chance
to review practice words similar to those on the real test. A total of 60 Chinese words were
presented successively on a computer screen for 3 s each. These are later referred to as
studied or old items. Another batch of 60 words, matched in usage frequency, was also
prepared. These are referred to as new items. Two old and two new items were used in
practice trials prior to the first recognition, and 30 old and 30 new items were used in the
first recognition. The other 30 old and 30 new items were used in the second recognition.
The order of these four types of items was counterbalanced among participants. After the
encoding, participants were asked to count backwards for 30 s.
Target status. Each participant was informed that the practice words he or she had
just seen were from the actual test due to a mistake made by the experimenter. The
participant was told that he or she must conceal the exposed test words from a detector who
was going to check with each participant about the test exposure. The participant was
instructed further that, once the detector found out about the concealment, the participant's
score on the vocabulary test would be deducted accordingly, thus, affecting the
participant's chance to win the monetary prices for the vocabulary test. Thus, the
participant must pretend to be as honest as possible while concealing the test words. The
participants were also promised (and later paid a constant amount) moderate payment for
successfully hiding the test exposure from the detector. Under the high-status deception
condition, the detector was introduced as a teacher, who was matched with the participant's
Deceiving yourself
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -641-
gender, looked 10 years older than the participant, and was formally dressed. Under the
equal-status condition, the person was introduced as a fellow student, who was of similar
age and same gender as the participant, and wore causal wear.
First recognition. A participant was told that, as each word appeared on the screen,
he or she must identify, as accurately as possible, whether he or she had seen the word
before by pressing one of two particular keys on the keyboard and that the participant must
lie to the detector by saying the opposite of his or her true memory. The participant was
also made aware of the fact that the detector was only watching the participant's face but
was not able to see the participant's hands which were hidden behind the computer. After
these instructions which were given to the participant without the detector's presence, the
detector showed up and was introduced to the participant either as a teacher or as a fellow
student. The participant and the detector were then seated facing each other across a
computer table and the participant proceeded with the recognition and deception task.
Second recognition. Each participant was debriefed and asked to identify as
accurately as possible the words the participant had seen for monetary incentives.
Results
Participants' performance on the recognition test was represented by three
indicators: Hit, False Alarm, and Sensitivity d' (see Table 1). Hit is the percentage of old
items correctly identified as old. False alarm is the percentage of new items incorrectly
identified as old. Sensitivity d' represents participants' discrimination between old and new
items, with larger numbers representing better discrimination as well as better memory.

A 2 (deceiving target: high- vs. equal-status) × 2 (recognition: first vs. second)
mixed model ANOVA was conducted separately using each of the three indicators as the
dependent variable. For Hit, there was a significant interaction effect, F(1,42) = 27.06, p <
.001, 2 = .39. Under the high-status deception condition, participants correctly identified
fewer old items the first time while lying (M = 19.50, SD = 5.14) than they did the second
time while being alone (M = 23.01, SD = 3.64), t(21) = -4.43, p < .001, whereas
participants under the equal-status condition showed a reversed pattern (first M = 22.67, SD
= 4.66; second M = 20.76, SD = 5.52), t(21) = 2.82, p = .01. For False Alarm, neither main
nor interaction effects were significant. For sensitivity d' there was a significant interaction,
F(1,40) = 6.14, p = .02, 2 = .13. Participants under the high-status condition showed worse

discrimination while lying (M = .86, SD = .81) than they did while being alone (M = 1.28,
SD = .38), t(20) = -2.47, p = .02, whereas participants under the equal-status condition
showed similar discrimination at both times (First M = 1.22, SD = .50; Second M = 1.12,
SD = .58), t(20) = .82, p = .42.
Given the different results between Hit and False Alarm, we further conducted a 2
(deceiving target: high- vs. equal-status) × 2 (recognition: first vs. second) × 2 (items: old
vs. new) mixed model ANOVA to examine how participants correctly identified old item
as old and new items as new. Results showed a significant three-way interaction, F(1,42) =
6.65, p = .01, 2 = .14. Further analysis showed that, for correctly identifying old items, an
interaction between target and recognition existed, F(1,42) = 27.06, p < .001, 2 = .39,
whereas, for correctly rejecting new items (i.e., 1 ­ false alarm), no interaction was found,
F(1,42) = .05, p = .82, 2 = .00. These results suggest that participants had worse memory
when they deceived a high- but not equal-status target. The worse memory was due to
incorrectly discriminating old items they had seen but not new items they had not seen.
Discussion
The results support our hypothesis that memory is temporarily worsened when one
is deceiving a high- but not equal-status target. The temporary memory impairment driven
by fear for detection thus helps to execute self-deception or perfect deception without
detection. Fear for detection is correlated with the social status of the deceived relative to
the deceiver (Cummins, 1999; Manktelow and Over, 1991) among other social conditions
contributing to the probabilities of deception detection. We further speculate that self-
deception may be automated by the mere presence of such social conditions as the social
status of the deceived. Such social conditions have been so frequently tied to deception
detection and retribution in the evolutionary past that no conscious calculation of
probabilities of detection and punishment may be necessary or ever carried out. Participants
under the high-status deception condition failed to recognize items they had actually seen.
We speculate that the fear of detection was so strong and was so closely tied to social status
that, at the sight of a teacher, a student participant would at times automatically engage in
correcting the deception that he or she was instructed to commit by misremembering an
item. We speculate that, within a "forced to lie" context such as the present experiment,
fear for detection potentially imbedded in a recurrent hierarchical social relationship (e.g.,
student-teacher relationship) would facilitate self-deception through impaired memory
without having to experimentally induce deceiving motivations.
Our speculation of a selected association between fear for detection and self-
deception is in part also supported by the finding that, when lying to the high-status target,
participants only mis-remembered by not remembering items they had seen (i.e., reduced
hit rates), but did not mis-remember by remembering items they had not seen (i.e., no
difference in false alarm). The first but not the second type of mis-remembering matches
with one common form of hierarchical relationship among primates, including humans:
Low-status individuals hide from the high-status peers resources they have in possession or
mistakes they have made. In one form or another, this type of hierarchical social interaction
should exert selection pressure to favor hiding and covering strategies among the low-status
Deceiving yourself

persons and finding and detecting strategies among the high-status persons. The subsequent
arms race (Trivers, 1976) is likely to be between status hierarchies, leading to the low-
status individuals self-deceiving high-status individuals by not remembering what they
have rather than fabricating what they do not have. The high-status individuals, on the other
hand, may be more likely to deceive by fabricating what they do not have or do not have
enough of (e.g., abilities and resources or good will and altruism). More empirical work is
needed to test these speculations. There are also alternative explanations, especially given
our fallible design, which we discuss in the end.
Study 2
An alternative interpretation of the results of Study 1 may be that participants'
memories became worse simply by interacting with a high-status target. That is, even
without being motivated or instructed to deceive the target, memory would become worse
when interacting with a high- compared to low-status person. This is particularly true given
the unequal teacher-student relationship. We addressed this potential problem in Study 2 by
asking participants to lie about some questions, which were test questions in Study 2, and
to tell the truth about other questions, which were called practice questions. If an
individual's memory became worse simply by interacting with a high-status person but not
by trying to deceive the person, the participant's memory on both kinds of material would
be equally worse when compared to interacting with an equal-status person. If memory
impairment occurred only on the test but not practice questions, then we had additional
confidence beyond that of Study 1 to support the hypothesis that people may use memory
to execute self-deception especially when low-status individuals interact with high-status
individuals. We also included exit interview questions to measure how worried and afraid
participants felt about being caught lying to the target to see if there were differences in
these emotions responding to the two kinds of targets. The design and procedure of the
experiment in Study 2 were identical to those of Study 1, but the encoding material was
different and was distinguished between test and practice questions.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Fifty-two college students (Mean age = 19.88, SD = 1.22; 30 males) from a
university in southern China took part in an ostensible knowledge contest for monetary
awards.
Procedure and design
Participants were randomly assigned into one of two experimental groups: high-
status interaction group (n = 28), where the detector was a teacher, and equal-status
interaction group (n = 24), where the detector was a student. Participants were told to
participate in a history and geography knowledge contest. They were first given certain
practice questions to study (encoding stage) and were then asked to lie about seeing some
of these questions and to tell the truth about seeing other questions to a detector who was
Deceiving yourself
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -644-
either a teacher or a fellow student. While lying or telling the truth, participants were at the
same time asked to indicate the true memory about seeing each question (first recognition).
After debriefing, participants were asked to remember the questions they had seen for
monetary incentives (second recognition). The design was a 2 (interacting target: high- vs.
equal-status) × 2 (recognition: first vs. second) × 2 (questions: lie vs. truth) mixed ANOVA
design.
Encoding. Participants were given 20 history questions (e.g., "In which dynasty
was papermaking technology developed?") and 20 geography questions (e.g., "Which is the
longest river in the world?"). By random assignment, half of the participants were told that
the 20 history questions were practice questions which they were supposed to study and
that the 20 geography questions were actual test questions which were given to them by
mistake and they were not supposed to have read. For the other participants, the order of
these two types of questions was reversed. These 40 questions were randomly presented
one by one on a computer in a speed of 5 s per question. Each question was labeled either
as "history practice question," "geography test question," "geography practice question," or
"history test question." After encoding, participants were asked to count backwards for
30 s.
Two parallel sets of 10 history and 10 geography questions that participants had not
read were prepared as new items to be included in each of the two subsequent recognition
tests. Thus, 10 history and 10 geography questions presented in the encoding stage were
used as old items and 10 history and 10 geography questions not presented were used as
new items in the first recognition, and the same combination of the other 10 old and 10 new
questions was used in the second recognition. The assignment of 40 old or new items was
counterbalanced among participants.
First recognition. Similar to Study 1, a participant was seated behind a computer
table across from a person who was introduced either as a teacher (high status) or as a
fellow student (equal status). Not in the presence of the detector, a participant was told that
the detector came to check which questions the participant had read, and that the participant
should lie about seeing test questions. Specifically, if a participant had previously seen a
test question (old item), the participant should say to the detector that he/she had not and, if
the participant had not seen a test question (new item), the participant should say he/she
had seen the question. As each question appeared on the screen, the detector would ask, for
example, "Did you read geography (history) question: which is the longest river in the
world? ("in which dynasty was papermaking technique developed?"). A participant should
identify, as accurately as possible, whether he/she had previously seen the question by
pressing one of two particular keys on the keyboard, which was hidden from the detector.
As the participant keyed in the truth about each question privately, he/she either lied to the
person about what he/she remembered as a test question or told the truth about what he/she
remembered as a practice question.
Second recognition. Each participant was then debriefed and asked to identify as
accurately as possible the words he/she had seen for monetary incentives.
In the exit interview, a participant was asked three questions: "Were you worried
about being caught?" "Did you feel nervous while lying?" and "What is the probability,
from 0 to 100%, that you might be caught by the detector?"

Results and Discussion
Participants reported to have felt more nervous while lying to the high-status target
(M = 2.96, SD = .99) than lying to the equal-status target (M = 2.25, SD = 1.15), t(50) =
2.40, p = .02, and the participants thought that the chance of being caught by the high-
status detector was higher (M = .56, SD = .19) than the equal-status detector (M = .40, SD =
.22), t(50) = 2.73, p = .009. Participants showed no difference in worrying about being
caught by the high-status (M = 2.71, SD = 1.15) or equal-status detector (M = 2.29, SD =
1.52), t(50) = 1.14, p = .26.
Participants' performance on the recognition test is shown in Table 2. A 2
(interaction target: high- vs. equal-status) × 2 (recognition: first vs. second) × 2 (question:
test vs. practice) mixed model ANOVA was conducted separately using each of the three
memory indicators as the dependent variable. For Hit, there was a main effect of
recognition, F(1,50) = 11.14, p = .002, 2 = .18, with Hit in the first recognition (M = .86,
SD = .12) being lower than that in the second (M = .91, SD = .11), and there was an
interaction between recognition and interaction target, F(1,50) = 7.48, p = .009, 2 = .13, an
interaction between recognition and question type, F(1,50) = 5.89, p = .019, 2 = .11, an
interaction between interaction target and question type, F(1,50) = 7.21, p = .010, 2 = .13,
and a three-way interaction, F(1,50) = 11.36, p = .001, 2 = .19. For test questions that
participants should lie about having read, a 2 (target) × 2 (recognition) mixed model
ANOVA showed a main effect of recognition, F(1,50) = 16.47, p < .001, 2 = .25, and the
interaction, F(1,50) = 21.14, p < .001, 2 = .30. Under the high-status target condition, Hit
in the first recognition was lower than that in the second recognition, t(27) = -7.30, p <
.001, whereas under the equal-status target condition, Hit in the two recognitions was
similar, t(23) = .40, p = .70. For practice questions that participants told the truth about
reading, a 2 (target) × 2 (recognition) mixed model ANOVA showed no significant main
effect or interaction effect.

For False Alarm, a 2 (interaction) × 2 (recognition) × 2 (questions) mixed model
ANOVA showed neither main effects nor interaction effects. For sensitivity d', there was
an interaction between recognition and interaction target, F(1,50) = 7.04, p = .011, 2 = .12,
an interaction between question type and interaction target, F(1,50) = 4.89, p = .032, 2 =
.09, and a three-way interaction, F(1,50) = 4.59, p = .037, 2 = .08. For test questions that
participants should lie about having read, a 2 (target) × 2 (recognition) mixed model
ANOVA showed a main effect of recognition, F(1,50) = 4.77, p = .034, 2 = .09, and an
interaction, F(1,50) = 9.90, p = .003, 2 = .17. Under the high-status target condition,
sensitivity d' in the first recognition was lower than that in the second recognition, t(27) =
-3.81, p = .001, whereas under the equal-status target condition, sensitivity d' in the first
recognition was similar to that in the second recognition, t(23) = .68, p = .50. For practice
questions that participants told the truth about reading, a 2 (target) × 2 (recognition) mixed
model ANOVA showed neither main effects nor an interaction effect.
These results suggest that participants had worse memory on material about which
they had to lie to a high- compared to equal-status target, whereas for material about which
participants did not have to lie, their memory did not differ when interacting with a high- or
an equal-status target. The worsened memory shown only when lying to a high-status target
was due to the motivation of deception rather than omnibus emotions, because memory for
honestly presented material was unimpaired. Such temporarily worsened memory helps
low-status individuals execute self-deception when lying to high-status others to whom
low-status individuals dare not lie for fear of detection.
Study 3
In the previous two studies we explicitly instructed participants to lie in order to
ensure the motivation to deceive, because otherwise a deceptive motivation is, by
definition, consciously inaccessible to individuals engaging in self-deception. However, it
is more natural for the participants to choose to deceive on their own rather than being told
to do so. In the present study, we created the situation such that it was inherently
advantageous for the participants to lie. The procedures, material, and instructions were
identical to those of Study 2 except that, instead of being instructed to lie to the detector as
in Study 2, each participant was told that a detector would come to check on what questions
the participant had seen and that certain marks would be deducted from his/her contest
score in the end for each test question the participant reported having seen. Like Study 2,
because of the experimenter's mistake, participants studied certain test questions that they
were not supposed to see. These test questions would help participants' performance on the
contest. Thus, participants were motivated to hide these test questions from the detector.
We also increased the monetary rewards for winning different prizes of the knowledge
contest to increase participants' motivation to deceive. Like in Study 2, participants were
asked in the exit interview whether they lied to the detector and how afraid they were to lie
to the detector.

Materials and Methods
Participants and designs
Forty-eight college students (Mean age = 20.27, SD = 1.31; 25 males) from a
university in southern China were recruited to take part in an ostensible contest of general
knowledge for monetary awards. They were randomly assigned into one of two
experimental groups: high-status interaction (n = 24), where the test detector was a teacher,
and equal-status interaction (n = 24), where the detector was a student. The design was a 2
(interaction target: high- vs. equal-status) × 2 (recognition: first vs. second) mixed design.
Results and Discussion
Participants' performance on the two recognition tests is shown in Table 3. A 2
(interaction target: high- vs. equal-status) × 2 (recognition: first vs. second) mixed model
ANOVA was conducted separately using each of the three memory indicators as the
dependent variable. For Hit, there was a main effect of recognition, F(1,46) = 13.59, p =
.001, 2 = .23, with Hit in the first recognition (M = .80, SD = .14) being lower than that in
the second recognition (M = .87, SD = .11), and there was an interaction between
recognition and interaction target, F(1,46) = 10.31, p = .002, 2 = .18. Under the high-status
target condition, Hit in the first recognition was lower than in the second recognition, t(23)
= -4.55, p < .001, whereas under the equal-status target condition, there was no difference
in Hit between the two recognitions, t(23) = .37, p = .72.

For False Alarm, a 2 (interaction) × 2 (recognition) mixed model ANOVA showed
neither main effects nor an interaction. For sensitivity d', there was a main effect of
recognition, F(1,46) = 8.25, p = .006, 2 = .15, with d' of the first recognition (M = 2.36,
SD = .58) being lower that that of the second (M = 2.60, SD = .57), and there was an
interaction between recognition and interaction target, F(1,46) = 5.70, p = .021, 2 = .11.
Under the high-status target condition, sensitivity d' in the first recognition was lower than
that in the second recognition, t(23) = -4.02, p = .001, whereas under the equal-status target
condition, d' in the first recognition was not different than that of the second recognition
t(23) = .32, p = .75.
The exit interview question showed that, among participants under the high-status
condition, 17 reported no deception and 7 reported deception, whereas the corresponding

numbers were 10 and 14 for participants under the equal-status condition, 2 = 4.15, p =
.042. Participants were more nervous while lying to the high-status target (M = 2.92, SD =
1.10) than lying to the equal-status target (M = 2.17, SD = 1.13), t(46) = 2.33, p = .02, and
they thought the chance of being caught by the high-status target was higher (M = .55, SD =
.25) than that with the equal-status target (M = .41, SD = .22), t(46) = 2.14, p = .04.
Participants were more worried about being caught by the high-status target (M = 2.99, SD
= 1.38) compared to the equal-status target (M = 2.13, SD = 1.15), t (46) = 2.38 p = .02.
These results, derived from a paradigm where participants had the motivation to
deceive on their own, are consistent with those of Studies 1 and 2 where participants were
instructed to deceive. Together, these results support the hypothesis of temporary memory
impairment when voluntarily lying or being told to lie, but not when telling the truth, to a
high- compared to equal-status target. Through temporarily worsened memory, individuals
deceived themselves to better deceive high- compared to equal-status others.
General Discussion
This study is among the first to empirically test Trivers's theory of self-deception
(Trivers, 1985, 2000). It also provides a methodological framework within which to
conduct research on self-deception in general. This framework is based on memory
research and approaches self-deception as inconsistencies between two memory tasks. This
approach demonstrates how self-deception is adaptive when one self-deceives by being
unaware of fitness enhancing information that is meant only to be kept away from others
(Leeuwen, 2007). We show that self-deception is adaptive if true information is kept from
the self only during deception and is accessible to the self after the goal of deception has
been achieved. Memory and its temporary loss or distortion aid this mental state of self-
deception. True information is not retrieved when the self-deceiver deceives others. When
deception ceases, the lost memory is recovered so that the self-deceiver benefits from
accurate information. By suppressing truthful information (i.e., concealing to deceive) or
by distorting encoded material (i.e., fabricating to deceive), memory helps one to
"honestly" offer null or false information to others. This aspect of self-deception does not
derive net fitness gains. By later retrieving the true information, memory helps to complete
self-deception to achieve net fitness. Memory is a direct target of selection (Nairne,
Pandeirada, and Thompson, 2008). It also may be co-opted to perform self-deception by
switching between the two states of consciousness. That almost all deceptive ploys use
memory as an honest or dishonest excuse may not be a coincidence.
Although we suggest that memory or the decoding stage of information processing
executes self-deception, encoding may also achieve self-deceptive goals. Motivational
biases in information searching and screening influence attention, perception, and
interpretation of incoming materials (Balcetis, 2008; Mele, 1997). These encoding biases of
information processing contribute to a type of self-deception widely studied as an
intrapersonally-oriented information manipulation process that achieves mental wellbeing.
Well-known examples of intrapersonal self-deception include moderate optimism (Taylor
and Brown, 1988), self-services (Greenwald, 1988), and competency and morality self-
enhancement (Paulhus and John, 1998). In addition to being involved in intrapersonal self-
Deceiving yourself
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -649-
deception, encoding may also be involved in interpersonal self-deception. People may
differentially take in and decipher information with a motivation to deceive others.
Through biased encoding, the self-deceiver may somehow know in advance that the
information so encoded will enhance fitness when retrieved to misinform others. Self-
deception may be achieved in the encoding stage where information is already distorted
before storage (Von Hippel and Trivers, 2011). This is in contrast to our decoding
approach, which assumes distorting information when being recalled. However, to be
adaptive, biased encoding has to enhance fitness all of the time or the biased encoder must
re-encode the information to stop self-deceiving after others have been deceived. Empirical
work is needed to test the encoding mechanism in interpersonal self-deception.
The present study also extends Trivers' theory by showing that the arms race
between deception and deception detection is more likely to have been played out with
low-status people as deceivers and self-deceivers and high-status people as detectors rather
than the other way around. In the hierarchical groups of primates and ancestral (as well as
modern) humans, social status provides protection from punishment and retribution when
conflicts arise among individuals or between individuals and the group (Wright, 1994).
When caught deceiving in a hierarchical group setting, high-status individuals are less
likely to be punished than low-status individuals who often face more severe consequences.
Status differentials should pressure low-status individuals to be careful and fearful
deceivers, whereas high-status deceivers should become unscrupulous and bold. Research
on humans and other primates confirm this speculation. An alpha chimpanzee can freely
exaggerate (i.e., deceive) his display of dominance and aggressiveness without being
challenged (Boehm, 1999). This is deemed similar to human leaders bragging about their
efforts or abilities. High-status humans are calmer and show fewer changes in heart rate
and skin conductance than their low-status counterparts when deceiving (Carney, 2010).
Low-status deceivers are also more likely to be caught than high-status deceivers who have
more resources, including information leading to detection. Facing a higher likelihood of
detection with a higher certainty of punishment, low-status deceivers yet have a higher
need to deceive than high-status individuals because, being low in status, they have fewer
resources and fewer honest means (e.g., either through force or alliance) to acquire them.
High-status individuals who have more resources to lose, on the other hand, have a greater
need to detect deception. The selection pressures to evade detection and detect deception
affect low-status and high-status individuals more than their counterparts, respectively. Our
empirical findings imply that self-deception, especially when carried out by low-status
individuals, may have been selected to better deceive high- rather than equal-status others.
Although this paper emphasizes status differences, we do not deny the possibility
that the arms race between deception and detection may have been advanced by the
intrapersonal experience of being both a deceiver and deceit detector (von Hippel and
Trivers, 2011). Having deceived makes one aware of the need to detect possible deception;
in turn, the detecting experience makes one cautious not to be detected. Such intrapersonal
experience helps to advance both ends of the arms race. It is also apparent that all humans
and many other animals have the potential to cheat and an equal urge to eliminate cheating,
independent of social ranking. There is clearly no division of labor between deceiving and
detecting. However, like any adaptation, environmental conditions shift selection power to
Deceiving yourself
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -650-
favor certain individuals over others as beneficiaries of the adaptation. We speculate that
the hierarchical context of primate groups (including humans) should favor high-status
members as detectors and low-status members as deceivers more than the other way
around. Both intrapersonal and interpersonal experience advances the arms race between
deceiving and detecting and should lead, as Trivers (2000) first theorized, to self-deception.
Our findings support this speculation.
Furthermore, our findings suggest that social status is so closely related to getting
caught and facing consequences that it may motivate self-deception without conscious
calculation of the odds of detection. Study 1 showed that when participants were instructed
to lie free from punishment, they still showed comparatively worse first-round memory
when lying to high-status compared to low-status targets. However, social status is not the
direct cause of self-deception; rather, it is a conditional variable that regulates the
likelihood of detection and punishment, and the latter motivates self-deception to avoid
detection. The number of targets to be deceived also moderates the probability of detection,
with a higher number increasing the likelihood of detection (Lu and Chang, 2011a, 2011b).
In other words, escaping detection from one person is easier than from a group because
each group member contributes to detective pressure and raises the likelihood of detection.
In this context, self-deception is adaptive because by deceiving one target (i.e., the self) the
person successfully deceives multiple targets (i.e., the group). Like social status, the
number of deceived may moderate self-deception such that it is more likely to occur when
one has to deceive a group of individuals rather than a single individual. We speculate that,
especially when high-status people engage in self-deception, their targets are more likely to
be groups than individuals. Religious and political leaders, in relation to their congregations
and constituencies, are good examples of self-deception serving to deceive groups.
Intrapersonal self-deception, such as self-enhancement, may represent a mental state that is
under constant pressure to group-deceive everyone around the deceiver (i.e., the general
public). Other moderators may include perceived determination of the target to detect and
avenge. Based on our findings regarding social status, we expect all of these social
conditions to enhance the likelihood of self-deception. That is, self-deception is more likely
to happen when low-status people try to deceive high-status people, when a single
individual tries to deceive a group, or when the deceiver perceives a clear determination
from the target to detect and avenge.
There are several limitations of this study, many of which are imbedded in the
operationalization of the unconscious process of self-deception. In deception research, a lie
can be verified either by post-experiment interviews or by readings of the participants'
heart rate and skin conductance. Because self-deception is partially unconscious, it cannot
be verified even physiologically, although some researchers believe that skin conductance
may show signs contradicting the conscious belief (Gur and Sackeim, 1979). Self-
deception is inferred by establishing the motivation to deceive and by obtaining
inconsistencies between two memories which must also be distinguished from blatant
deception. In Study 1 and 2, we instructed participants to lie. This ensures the motivation to
deceive. In Study 1, 2, and 3, we asked participants to remember which items they had seen
before reporting them to the target. This separates out the direct deceivers who would
remember and report different items. However, these design features reduce the ecological
Deceiving yourself
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -651-
validity of our studies because in real deception, a deceiver or a self-deceiver only lies or
reports to the target without first recording his/her memory.
We used factual items in all studies to examine how memory executes self-
deception. This kind of memory offers insufficient room for distortion. Memory for
episodes or personal experience may provide more room for distortion to better facilitate
self-deception. Future studies are also needed to test self-deception on participants from
other non-Chinese cultural backgrounds. Even though the issue under discussion represents
pan-cultural evolutionary predictions, culture and the social settings from which culture
evolved may have particularly relevant bearing on social interactive strategies. More deeply
rooted in social compared to individual learning (Chang et al., 2011), Asians who also
seem to pay special attention to social hierarchy may be particularly prone to self-deception
compared to straight deception. More replications using more diverse cultural groups will
help to confirm and illuminate evolutionary predictions.
Finally, whereas self-deception is originally construed mainly as an interpersonal
strategy to facilitate the deception of others (Trivers, 1976, 1985), it has also been studied
as an intrapersonal variable that represents chronic mis-representation or selective
representation of the self without immediate reference to others (Kurzban and Aktipis,
2007; Lu and Chang, 2011b; Paulhus and Reid, 1991; von Hippel and Trivers, 2011). The
present study focuses on the interpersonal process of self-deception. Future research may
examine both interpersonal and intrapersonal self-deception together to better understand
this social adaptation. Despite these limitations, this is among the first studies to test an
important evolutionary theory about self-deception. Methodologically, this study
demonstrates the use of dual-retrieval as a useful paradigm within which to conduct future
studies on self-deception. Theoretically, the study demonstrates how the memory system
may have been co-opted to execute self-deception, and how social hierarchy may have
shifted selection power to favor low- over high-status individuals as deceivers and self-
deceivers.
