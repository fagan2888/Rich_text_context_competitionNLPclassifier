Objective: To examine the association between intra-
uterine growth restriction (IUGR) status at birth among
full-term infants, exposure to substance use during preg-
nancy, and risk of hypertension at 6 years of age.
Design: Prospective evaluation of high-risk children.
Setting: Four centers of the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development Neonatal Research
Network.
Participants: One thousand three hundred eighty-eight
infants (600 cocaine exposed, 781 nonexposed, and 7 in-
determinate,matchedbygestationalage,race,andsex),were
enrolled at these sites. Nine hundred fifty children (415 ex-
posed, 535 nonexposed) were followed up for 6 years.
Intervention: Right arm blood pressure was measured
using the Dinamap portable adult/pediatric monitor with
appropriate cuff size.
Main Outcome Measure: Blood pressure levels.
Hypertension was defined as either systolic or diastolic
blood pressure higher than the 95th percentile for sex,
age, and height.
Results: Eight hundred ninety-one children had
blood pressure data at 6 years of age: 516 were born at
full term; 144 (28%) of the 516 children had a diagno-
sis of IUGR at birth. At 6 years of age, 93 (19%) of 516
children had hypertension. Of 144 children with
IUGR, 35 (24%) had hypertension as compared with
58 (16%) of 372 children without IUGR (P.05).
Twenty percent of cocaine-exposed children had
hypertension as compared with 16% of nonexposed
children (P=.20). Intrauterine growth restriction sta-
tus at birth was significantly associated with hyperten-
sion (relative risk, 1.8 [95% confidence interval, 1.2-
2.7]) when multivariable Poisson regression analysis
was performed adjusting for site; maternal race, educa-
tion, and tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, and cocaine use
during pregnancy; and child's current body mass
index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared).
Conclusion: In term infants, IUGR is linked to risk of
hypertension in early childhood, which may be a marker
for adult cardiovascular disease.

ADULTS WHO WERE NOTED
at birth to have low birth
weight have been found to
have hypertension in ret-
rospective analysis of the
relationship between current blood pres-
sure (BP) and birth weight.1 A prospec-
tive study (Perinatal Collaborative Project)
studied 137 black Americans and found
BP and birth weight are not correlated at
age 28 years.2 Hinchliffe et al3 proposed a
potential pathogenesis for the linkage
between low birth weight and hyperten-
sion in adulthood: the undernourished,
growth-retarded fetus becomes a low-
birth-weight newborn whose kidneys have
a reduced number of nephrons. To our
knowledge, the risk of hypertension in
early childhood among infants who were
of normal gestation but growth restricted
at birth has not been examined in a pro-
spective manner.
Prenatal cocaine exposure is associ-
ated with growth restriction at birth in both
full-term and preterm pregnancies.4-6 The
deleterious effect of prenatal cocaine ex-
posure may be greater in full-term com-
pared with preterm pregnancies,7 with
growth deceleration in cocaine-exposed in-
fants evident after 32 weeks' gestation.4

caine exposure and BP in early childhood

high BP was noted among cocaine-
exposed infants (n=12), while the study by
Needlman et al9 evaluating BP in 32 co-
caine-exposed and 23 nonexposed infants
found no differences in BP between groups.

The objective of this study was to examine the asso-
ciation between intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)
status at birth among full-term infants, substance use dur-
ing pregnancy, and risk for hypertension at 6 years of age
in a multisite, prospective, longitudinal study.
METHODS
ThisanalysisispartoftheongoingMaternalLifeStylestudy,evalu-
ating the impact of maternal lifestyle during pregnancy on child-
hood outcome. The study is performed at Brown University, Uni-
versity of Miami, University of Tennessee (Memphis), and Wayne
State University. The 4 clinical sites are participating centers of
the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Neonatal Research Network. The study was approved by the in-
stitutional review board at each site and informed consent was
obtained from the parents prior to participation.
Infants were prospectively recruited into the study between
May 1993 and May 1995. Infants born to women who used co-
caine during pregnancy (exposed group) were matched to non­
cocaine exposed (comparison group) infants by gestational age,
race,andsexwithinthesameinstitutionduringthesamerecruit-
ment year. Inclusion criteria were maternal age 18 years or older,
inborn birth, singleton birth, and gestational age of 43 weeks or
less.Exclusioncriteriawerematernalpsychiatricdisordersorde-

copy. Prenatal exposure to alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana ex-
istedinbothcocaine-exposedandnon­cocaineexposedgroups.10
Gestational age was assessed by the Ballard examination.11 The
children were categorized at birth to have a normal birth weight
for gestational age or IUGR if birth weight was lower than the
10th percentile.12 Only full-term infants were participants in the
present study, since prematurity is a risk factor for elevated BP in
adolescents and adulthood.13,14 Infants were prospectively fol-
lowedupateachsitewithannualvisits.Atthe6-yearvisittoeach
clinical center, BP was measured as the average of 3 measure-
ments of the right arm BP using the Dinamap portable adult/
pediatricmonitor(Critikon,Tampa,Fla)withtheappropriatecuff
sizefortheupperarm,withthewidthofthecuffbladderthatwas
40% of mid upper arm circumference. The child was seated dur-
ing the measurements. The child's height was obtained using a
stadiometerandweight,withthepediatricdigitalscale.Thechild's
body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilograms di-
videdbyheightinmeterssquared)wasnotedonthegrowthcharts
established by the National Center for Health Statistics in col-
laboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion.15 Hypertension was defined as systolic BP or diastolic BP in
the 95th percentile or higher for sex, age, and height based on
the National High Blood Pressure Education Working Group on
High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents.16 The growth
measurementsandBPmeasurementswereobtainedbythestudy
research nurse at each clinical center. Prior to each annual clinic

Poisson regression with robust standard errors17 was used to
examine the effect of IUGR status at birth and BP at 6 years of
age, adjusting for (1) clinical center, maternal race and educa-
tion, and preeclampsia, and (2) use of tobacco, marijuana, alco-
hol, and cocaine during pregnancy and child's BMI at 6 years of
age.MaternalBPlevelswerenotobtainedatthechild's6-yearvisit

RESULTS
Of the 19 079 women screened, 11 811 consented to par-
ticipate in the acute phase of the study evaluating neonatal

gitudinal phase of the study, 1388 infants were enrolled at
1 month; there were 600 infants in the cocaine-exposed
group, 781 in the comparison group, and 7 infants with
indeterminatecocaineexposurewhoweresubsequentlyex-
cluded from this analysis. There were 811 full-term in-
fants with a gestational age of more than 36 weeks en-

The clinical and demographic characteristics of the chil-
dren born with IUGR and those without IUGR status are
presented in Table 2. Maternal age was higher and to-
baccoandcocaineuseduringpregnancywerehigheramong
the women with infants who had IUGR at birth as com-
pared with those infants who did not have growth restric-
tion at birth. The average weight of the infants who had
IUGR at birth was 871 g less than those who did not have
IUGR at birth.
MEASUREMENTS AT 6 YEARS OF AGE
A systolic BP in the 95th percentile or higher was noted
among 90 (17.4%) of 516 children born full term. A dia-
stolic BP in the 95th percentile or higher was recorded
among 14 (2.7%) of 516 children born full term. A sys-
tolic or diastolic BP in the 95th percentile or higher was
seen among 93 (18.0%) of 516 children. These measure-
ments were the mean of 3 readings. The first reading was
the highest of 3 systolic BP readings in 44% of the chil-
dren, while the first reading was the highest of 3 diastolic
BP readings in 36% of the children.
The characteristics of the children with and without
hypertension are presented in Table 3. The rate of hy-
pertension at 6 years of age was greater among children
who had IUGR at birth as compared with those who were
of normal weight. Center differences in the rate of hy-
pertension were also noted. The rate of hypertension did
not differ among children exposed to maternal use of to-

bacco, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and opiates during
pregnancy as compared with those not exposed to these
substances. Maternal educational status did not influ-
ence rate of hypertension.
The mean (SD) BMI at 6 years of age among children
who had IUGR at birth was 15.3 (2.0) as compared with
those who did not have growth restriction at birth (16.9
[2.8]) (P.001).
The multivariable logistic regression analyses evalu-
ating model of risk for hypertension show that IUGR sta-
tus at birth (relative risk, 1.8 [95% confidence interval,
1.2-2.7]) and BMI (per unit increase, relative risk, 1.1
[95% CI, 1.1-1.2]) increase risk for hypertension
(Table 4). Again, center differences were noted in the
risk for hypertension at 6 years of age.
COMMENT
In this report, we have demonstrated that in full-term
infants, IUGR status at birth appears to be linked to risk
for hypertension in childhood after adjusting for poten-
tial confounders. These results suggest that IUGR status
at birth may result in lifelong consequences because
hypertension is a marker for adult cardiovascular
disease.
We excluded preterm infants in this study because pre-
term birth has effects on the vascular system that persist
to adult life. Kistner et al13 have demonstrated that pre-
term birth affects the retinal vascular system, both func-
tionally and structurally, resulting in a lower threshold
for the development of vascular disease. Another reason
for excluding children who were born preterm was that
BP has been found to be significantly higher in very low-
birth-weight subjects in late adolescence as compared with
normal-birth-weight subjects.14
Blood pressure was measured in our study by the por-
table Dinamap monitor, an oscillometric device, and com-
pared with normative data obtained by the sphygmoma-
nometer auscultatory method.16 Relationships between
BP measurements using the Dinamap monitor and the
sphygmomanometer method have been debated. Ear-
lier reports by investigators have noted the accuracy of
BP measurements by the Dinamap monitor in infants and
children.19,20 Most recent data, however, have shown that
higher readings are obtained by the Dinamap monitor as
compared with the sphygmomanometer.21 However, the
Dinamap monitor is the most common instrument used
in current clinical practice. The BP cuffs used in this study
were based on the recommendations established by the
National High Blood Pressure Education Program Work-
ing Group on High Blood Pressure in Children and Ado-
lescents.16 By doing so, we believe we have avoided the
pitfalls of inappropriate cuff selection.22
In this study, an association between increases in BMI
and elevation in BP was noted. The systolic BP of chil-
dren, adolescents, and adults is affected by BMI mea-
sured at corresponding ages.23-26 Although overweight
and obesity status were not seen in the 6-year-old chil-
dren in this report, we anticipate the frequency of these
conditions to increase as the children continue to be
evaluated at older ages,27,28 when it is anticipated a
greater association of BMI with hypertension can be
demonstrated.
Race and socioeconomic factors have been shown to
influence hypertension. Black Americans are at higher
risk for hypertension than white Americans, and an in-
crease in overweight and obesity in Hispanic individu-
als has been reported.25,26,29 Among minorities, the rela-
tive risk for hypertension is significant for both sex and
overweight status. The majority of the children in our
study were black; however, no risk for hypertension was
attributed to race. Unfortunately, we did not measure ma-
ternal BP at the child's 6-year clinic visit because this is
an important confounder. We are currently obtaining BP
measurements at the 9-year visit of the children. We did
find clinical site differences, which need to be explored.
In our study, at 6 years of age, we did not find a rela-
tionship between sex and hypertension. Socioeconomic
status was measured as maternal education in our study
and was not associated with hypertension.
Theassociationbetweenmaternallifestyleduringpreg-
nancy and risk for hypertension in the offspring is unclear
when examining prenatal cocaine exposure and elevated
BP in childhood. Horn8 examined 12 infants following in-
trauterine cocaine exposure and noted that half of the in-
fantshadhypertensionornormalBP.Needlmanetal9 found
no differences in BP between 32 cocaine-exposed and 23
nonexposed infants at 8 to 26 months of age. Echocardi-
ography of infants born to women following cocaine ex-
posure and comparison infants (total of 87 infants evalu-
ated)hasnotdemonstratedanydifferenceintheshortening
fraction of the left ventricle or abnormalities in cardiac
rhythm.30 Prenatal exposure to cigarettes has been associ-
ated with elevated BP at birth and at 12 months of age.31
We did not find any association with either cocaine, opi-
ate, marijuana, tobacco, or alcohol use during pregnancy
and hypertension at 6 years of age.

Additional risk factors for hypertension are diet32,33 and
genetic determinant of cardiovascular risk.34 New arte-
riosclerosis risk factors in obese children and adoles-
cents and children and adolescents with hypertension and
diabetes are now available.35 As we follow up our cohort
longitudinally we will obtain data on these risk factors.
Sixteen percent of children who did not have growth
restriction at birth were found to have hypertension at 6
years of age. We suggest that this high rate reflects an
atypical study group that is predominantly inner city and
African American and has a low socioeconomic status.
In summary, in this study we have demonstrated an as-
sociation between IUGR status at birth and elevated BP at
6 years of age among full-term infants. Six years of age may
be too young to label a child at risk for hypertension; how-
ever, an awareness of the prehypertensive status in child-
hood may serve as a signal to institute healthful lifestyle
changes that might avert future cardiovascular disease.36
