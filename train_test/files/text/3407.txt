Survival Processing and the Stroop Task:
Does the Survival Advantage Depend on
Deeper Processing During Encoding?
Stephanie A. Kazanas1, Kendra M. Van Valkenburg2, and Jeanette Altarriba1
Abstract
This study was designed to investigate the impact of survival processing with a novel task for this paradigm: the Stroop color-
naming task. As the literature is mixed with regard to task generalizability, with survival processing promoting better
memory for words, but not better memory for faces or paired associates, these types of task investigations are important to
a growing field of research. Using the Stroop task provides a unique contribution, as identifying items by color is an
important evolutionary adaptation and not specific to humans as is the case with word recall. Our results indicate that
survival processing, with its accompanying survival-relevance rating task, remains the best mnemonic strategy for word
memory. However, our results also indicate that presenting the survival passage does not motivate better color-naming
performance than color-naming alone. In addition, survival processing led to a larger amount of Stroop interference, though
not significantly larger than the other conditions. Together, these findings suggest that considering one's survival when
performing memory and attention-based tasks does not enhance cognitive performance generally, although greater allocation
of attentional resources to color-incongruent concrete objects could be considered adaptive. These findings support the
notion that engaging in deeper processing via survival-relevance ratings may preserve these words across a variety of
experimental manipulations.

Introduction
The mnemonic benefit from processing words for their survival
value, relative to other, well-known memory strategies, is
known as the ``survival advantage'' (Nairne, Thompson, and
Pandeirada, 2007). In their seminal work, Nairne, Thompson,
and Pandeirada (2007) described findings from four related
experiments. In each experiment, participants rated the rele-
vance of a list of neutral, unrelated words to the following
survival scenario:
In this task, we would like you to imagine that you are stranded
in the grasslands of a foreign land, without any basic survival
materials. Over the next few months, you'll need to find steady
supplies of food and water and protect yourself from predators.
We are going to show you a list of words, and we would like
you to rate how relevant each of these words would be for you
in this survival situation. Some of the words may be relevant
and others may not--it's up to you to decide.
Then, participants received an unexpected memory test for the
words that they had rated. Several deep-processing control
conditions--moving relevance, pleasantness rating, and self-
relevance--were pit against the survival-relevance condition.
Across all four experiments, Nairne et al. (2007) found that
processing in terms of survival increased retention compared
to these control conditions. The survival advantage was con-
sistent across their experiments. These findings provide insight
into the evolutional history of the human memory system, as

memory may be optimized to help us solve problems related to
survival (Nairne et al., 2007; Nairne & Pandeirada, 2010).
Moreover, it may be the case that considering ancestral prio-
rities in particular may underlie the effect, relative to general
survival situations (Weinstein, Bugg, & Roediger, 2008; but
see Kostic, McFarlan, & Cleary, 2012).
Nairne, Pandeirada, and Thompson (2008) extended their
previous findings by comparing the benefit of survival process-
ing against other conditions that traditionally produce high
retention. In Experiment 1, participants were assigned to the
standard survival condition or one of several important control
conditions: pleasantness, imagery, self-reference, generation,
or intentional learning. Across all comparisons, survival pro-
cessing promoted the best recall performance. These results
were also upheld in an additional experiment that compared
survival processing with another scenario: a vacation-
processing condition. These findings have led Nairne et al.
(2008) to argue that survival processing ``is one of the best--
if not the best--encoding procedures yet identified in human
memory research'' (p. 180).
Recently, researchers have begun to investigate the potential
mechanisms underlying the survival advantage. For example,
some have argued that survival processing is particularly effec-
tive for promoting better memory performance because it
invokes self-referential processing (Klein, 2012, 2014) and
planning (Klein, Robertson, & Delton, 2010). Burns and col-
leagues have also indicated that survival processing promotes
both item-specific and relational processing, while control con-
ditions often rely on just a single type of processing during
encoding (Burns, Burns, & Hwang, 2011; Burns, Hart, Griffith,
& Burns, 2013). Others have noted that survival processing
leads to increased elaboration on the to-be-remembered words
during the encoding task. According to Kroneisen and Erd-
felder (2011), this elaborative encoding during survival pro-
cessing leads to a larger mnemonic benefit. Their modified
survival passage--which described just a single survival prob-
lem in a need for water--did not promote better memory when
compared with the typical control conditions. Similarly, Ro
¨er,
Bell, and Buchner (2013) have observed that participants gen-
erate a significantly greater number of ideas for how the to-be-
remembered words might be used in survival settings, relative
to how they might be used in other settings. Together, these
findings indicate that modifying the specific task used within
the experiment can bring us closer to uncovering the precise
mechanisms underlying the advantage.
However, results are mixed regarding the use of additional
tasks to test the survival advantage. For example, researchers
have found that survival processing can promote better com-
pound remote association task performance (Garner & Howe,
2013), location memory (Nairne, Van Arsdall, Pandeirada, &
Blunt, 2012), and picture recall (Otgaar, Smeets, & van Bergen,
2010) than control conditions. On the other hand, survival pro-
cessing does not appear to benefit face memory (Savine, Scul-
lin, & Roediger, 2011), implicit task performance (McBride,
Thomas, & Zimmerman, 2013; Tse & Altarriba, 2010), paired-
associate learning (Schwartz & Brothers, 2014; unless they
are animate paired-associates, VanArsdall, Nairne, Pandeir-
ada, & Cogdill, 2015), or spatial N-back performance (Altar-
riba & Kazanas, 2014). Thus, an interesting area of inquiry for
this area of research is determining the precise conditions
when survival processing does and does not enhance cogni-
tive performance (Kazanas & Altarriba, 2015). As the major-
ity of studies conducted within this area of research have used
rating tasks designed to promote word memory, we believe
that it is important to investigate whether survival processing
can improve performance on other tasks as well.
One task that has not been used within this area of research
is the Stroop (1935) color-naming task. In this task, words are
printed in color, and participants respond to each word by
naming the color. When color words (e.g., red and blue) are
used, congruent trials (e.g., red printed in red) are easier to
process than incongruent trials (e.g., red printed in blue).
Stroop had commented that this interference from the color
manipulation was the result of color naming disrupting normal
reading. An interesting set of follow-up experiments conducted
by Besner, Stolz, and Boutilier (1997) manipulated the amount
of color interference used in their Stroop tasks: Words were
either printed fully in color or only a single letter within each
word was presented in color. This latter condition significantly
reduced the amount of interference in color naming, as less
attention was given to the entire word.
Why would the Stroop color-naming task provide a unique
contribution to this area of research? Very few studies have
examined the role of survival processing on evolutionarily-
relevant tasks (but see Savine et al., 2011 for a failure to
replicate the survival advantage with faces). Studies from
related paradigms, such as the emotion literature, indicate that
processing threatening stimuli can have a facilitative effect on
color-naming performance. For example, Shibasaki, Isomura,
and Masataka (2014) determined that both adults and children
were able to detect the color of snakes faster than the color of
flowers. These findings indicate that negative emotion, and
perhaps fear in particular, can have a motivating effect on
cognitive processing.
Detecting color and identifying items by color are also
rooted in evolutionary theory (for recent reviews, see e.g.,
Jacobs, 2009; Lucas et al., 2003; Melin et al., 2012; Sumner
& Mollon, 2003). For example, Bompas, Kendall, and Sumner
(2013) have determined that normal trichromats (organisms
with three types of color receptors on their retina, including
humans) detect fruit better than those with color deficiencies,
with the largest differences in detection performance at long
distances. Other selection pressures may have included a need
to detect predators, young leaves, or social signals related to
reproduction (Kawamura et al., 2012; Melin et al., 2012; Pes-
soa et al., 2014; Surridge, Osorio, & Mundy, 2003). Several of
these hypotheses have also been assessed using animal models,
including macaque (Horwitz, 2015) and capuchin (Melin et al.,
2014) monkeys. These hypothetical accounts for the evolution
of color vision lend themselves to the survival-processing para-
digm in that they are the goals outlined within the survival
passage itself.

The Current Study
The current study was motivated by a set of related goals. First,
we were interested in the impact of manipulating levels of
processing within the survival-processing paradigm. While
researchers have begun to investigate the role of deeper process-
ing within the survival passage relative to control conditions
(e.g., Kroneisen & Erdfelder, 2011; Ro
¨er, Bell, & Buchner,
2013), the current study aims to compare depth of processing
within the encoding tasks themselves. By using the Stroop task
specifically, we can investigate a second but related line of
research. As human color vision is strongly believed to be evo-
lutionarily adaptive in nature (e.g., Bompas, Kendall, & Sumner,
2013), using the Stroop task will allow us to determine whether
survival processing can boost color-naming performance. Addi-
tionally, we are able to determine whether a congruency between
the survival passage and the adaptive nature of the color-naming
task can promote better memory performance. Finally, by using
multiple variants of the Stroop task, we can directly test whether
differences in color-naming performance reported by Besner
et al. (1997) replicate within this paradigm.
Method
Participants
Participants in this experiment (N ¼ 130) were University at
Albany undergraduate students. Each participant gave their
informed consent and received either course credit or extra
credit for a psychology course. Participants indicated that they
had normal or corrected to normal vision and were tested for
normal color vision with the Ishihara (1993) Test Chart Book
for Color Deficiency.
Experimental Conditions
Participants were randomly assigned to one of the five condi-
tions (N ¼ 26 for each of the five conditions) and received
instructions specific to their condition: survival with relevance
ratings, survival with word-color naming, survival with letter-
color naming, pleasantness ratings, or baseline word-color
naming. Participants in three of the conditions read the survival
scenario (Nairne et al., 2007). One condition resembled the
standard survival scenario, with all words presented in black
in a survival-relevance word rating task:
In this task, we would like you to imagine that you are stranded
in the grasslands of a foreign land, without any basic survival
materials. Over the next few months, you'll need to find steady
supplies of food and water and protect yourself from predators.
We are going to show you a list of words, and we would like
you to rate how relevant each of these words would be for you
in this survival situation. Some of the words may be relevant
and others may not--it's up to you to decide.
The other two survival conditions used the Stroop color-
naming task. Five colors were used (red, yellow, green, blue,
and purple), with an approximately equal number of words per
color (5 or 6), pseudorandomly arranged with no more than
three of the same color in a row. Words were either presented
in neutral (e.g., stone presented in blue) or incongruent (e.g.,
emerald presented in red) colors. In one condition, the word-
color naming condition, entire words were presented in color,
and participants were instructed to name the color of each
word, via key press:
In this task, we would like you to imagine that you are stranded
in the grasslands of a foreign land, without any basic survival
materials. Over the next few months, you'll need to find steady
supplies of food and water and protect yourself from predators.
We are going to show you a list of words, and we would like
you to name each color that the word is presented in. Identify-
ing items by color may be useful to survival.
In the second condition, the letter-color naming condition
(Besner, Stolz, & Boutilier, 1997), one letter within each word,
was presented in a color. The remaining letters were presented
in black. Instructions for this condition read:
In this task, we would like you to imagine that you are stranded in
the grasslands of a foreign land, without any basic survival mate-
rials.Overthe nextfewmonths,you'llneedtofindsteady supplies
of food and water and protect yourself from predators. We are
going to show you a list of words, and a single letter in each word
will be colored. We would like you to name the color of that
single-letter. Identifying items by color may be useful to survival.
Pleasantness rating instructions, with all words presented in
black, read:
In this task, we are going to show you a list of words, and we
would like you to rate the pleasantness of each word. Some of
the words may be pleasant and others may not--it's up to you to
decide.
One final condition was used as a baseline for the two Stroop
conditions. In this condition, participants performed a simple
word-color naming task (without reading the survival passage),
in order to determine the effectiveness of color processing in
encoding a word for later retrieval. In this condition, entire
words were presented in color. Their instructions read:
We are going to show you a list of words, and we would like
you to name each color that the word is presented in.
Materials
All participants rated or named the color of the same set of 32
words, presented in the same order (selected from Nairne et al.,
2007, Experiments 1 and 2). Five additional words (all concrete
nouns, selected from Nairne et al., 2007, Experiment 3) were
used to allow the participants to practice the task, but their
responses to these words were not retained for analyses.
Kazanas et al. 3
Procedure
Participants were run individually, within the Cognition and
Language Laboratory. Each word was presented for 5 s, during
which participants performed either the rating or naming task,
via keypress. The experimenter assisted with practice trials,
only. After the rating or color-naming experimental trials, all
participants performed 2 min of forward digit span (set to a
length of seven digits), followed by an unexpected free recall
task. Each participant was given a maximum of 10 min to recall
as many words as they could, in any order.
After the recall task, participants in the three survival con-
ditions answered the following questions (from Nairne & Pan-
deirada, 2010): (1) How interesting was the scenario? (2) How
easy was it for you to create an ``image'' of the scenario in your
mind? (3) How emotionally arousing was the scenario? (4)
How familiar are you with the situation described? Two addi-
tional questions were included in the questionnaire (from
Otgaar et al., 2011; Sandry, Trafimow, Marks, & Rice,
2013): (5) How distinctive, or unusual, was the scenario? (6)
How rich in detail would you rate the scenario?
After answering these questions, participants completed a
brief demographic questionnaire, which included questions
related to age, gender, education, and native language. Each
participant received a debriefing form and was granted credit
for their participation.
Results
First, participants in all five conditions were matched on age,
level of education, and native language (all ps > .05). In
addition, there were no significant differences in survival
relevance, pleasantness, or color naming (whether naming
was according to word or letter color) response times (RTs;
all ps > .05). RTs in these conditions (M ¼ 1667 ms) were
significantly slower than RTs in the baseline word-color
naming condition (M ¼ 1370 ms; p < .05). Finally,
survival-relevance and pleasantness ratings did not interact
with recall performance (all ps > .05), which is common in
this area of research (see Kazanas & Altarriba, 2015). This is
an important indicator that a word's a priori survival rele-
vance or pleasantness does not increase its memorability dur-
ing the recall task.
Next, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was con-
ducted to detect any differences in the proportion of correct
recall among the five conditions. This ANOVA was signifi-
cant, F(4, 125) ¼ 129.213, p < .01. Planned contrasts revealed
that recall in the survival with relevance-rating condition was
greatest (M ¼ .424), which was significantly greater than recall
in the pleasantness condition (M ¼ .283; p < .01). These two
conditions led to significantly greater recall than the three
color-naming conditions (all ps < .01). Recall across the sur-
vival with word-color naming (M ¼ .082), baseline word-color
naming (M ¼ .055), and survival with letter-color naming (M ¼
.049) conditions did not differ (all ps > .05). Means and stan-
dard deviations (SDs) for recall in these five conditions are
included in Table 1, and Figure 1 includes means and 95%
confidence intervals.
A series of one-way ANOVAs and planned contrasts were
conducted to detect any differences in each of the scenario
ratings among the three survival conditions. Two of these
ANOVAs were significant. The rating for how ``interesting the
scenario was'' was significant, F(2, 75) ¼ 3.413, p < .05, with
planned contrasts revealing that participants found the survival
with relevance-rating and survival with letter-color naming
conditions as equally interesting and more interesting than
the survival with word-color naming condition. The rating
for ``imageability'' was also significant, F(2, 75) ¼ 9.119,
p < .001, with the survival with relevance-rating condition
being the most imageable and survival with letter-color and
word-color naming conditions being equally imageable. The
ratings for ``emotional arousal,'' ``familiarity,'' ``distinctive-
ness,'' and ``richness'' did not differ among the three sur-
vival conditions (i.e., participants found these conditions to
be equally arousing, familiar, distinctive, and rich in detail).
Means and SDs for each rating by condition comparison are
included in Table 2. Overall, results from the scenario ratings
reflect those of the recall task: Each of these ratings is believed
to measure a dimension of encoding that enhances memory and
retrieval. Thus, it is reasonable for higher ratings on these
dimensions to correspond with better recall. While participants
consistently rated the survival with relevance-rating condition
higher than the other conditions on many of these dimensions,
differences across conditions were only significant for the
``interesting'' and ``imageable'' dimensions, with the ``image-
able'' ratings matching recall performance. Perhaps the con-
crete nature of the relevance-rating task is an important
contributor to its effect on memory.
Approximately half of our participants recalled words that
were not included on either the practice or the experimental
trials. Intrusions were analyzed in two ways. First, we analyzed
the total number of intrusions according to condition, using a
one-way ANOVA. This ANOVA was significant, F(4, 73) ¼
3.728, p < .01. Participants in the survival with word-color
naming condition recalled the highest number of intrusions
(M ¼ 4.18), which was significantly greater than the number
reported by participants in the pleasantness condition, who
recalled the fewest intrusions (M ¼ 1.42; p ¼ .01). We then
grouped our intrusions into a number of categories: survival-
related (e.g., knife), semantically related to words from the lists
(e.g., rock, as stone was one of the practice words), phonolo-
gically related to words from the lists (e.g., can, as pan was one
of the experimental words), orthographically related to words
from the lists (e.g., pen, as pan was one of the experimental
words), colors (e.g., blue), color related (e.g., fire hydrant), and
other (e.g., believe). When analyzing the intrusion categories
according to condition, two of the interactions were significant:
the survival-related category, F(4, 75) ¼ 4.215, p < .01, and the
color-related category, F(4, 75) ¼ 3.153, p < .05. In the
survival-related category, participants in the survival with
word-color naming condition made more intrusions (M ¼
2.17) than the baseline color-naming condition (M ¼ .64) and
4 Evolutionary Psychology
pleasantness-rating condition (M ¼ .50; both ps < .05). In the
color-related category, participants in the baseline color-
naming condition (M ¼ .64) made more intrusions than the
survival-relevance rating condition (M ¼ 0; p < .05).
Finally, to determine whether the survival scenario moti-
vated better Stroop performance, we conducted several analy-
ses across the three color-naming conditions. First, we assessed
overall color-naming accuracy with a one-way ANOVA. There
were no significant differences across these conditions (p ¼
.063), though the survival with word-color naming condition
had a lower proportion of correct responses (M ¼ .91), relative
to the survival with letter-color naming (M ¼ .98) and baseline
word-color naming (M ¼ .98) conditions. Next, we compared
RTs to incongruent (e.g., emerald presented in red) and neutral
(e.g., stone presented in blue) words across the three color-
naming conditions. Although the survival with word-color
naming condition had the largest amount of interference
(M ¼ 71 ms), relative to the baseline word-color naming
condition (M ¼ 35 ms) and survival with letter-color naming
condition (M ¼ 1 ms), the magnitude of interference did not
significantly differ across these conditions, F(2, 75) ¼ 0.623,
p ¼ .539. While this pattern of interference data resembles
those described by Besner et al. (1997), with a reduction in
color-naming interference when participants focused on the
color of a single letter within a word, any nonsignificant result
should be interpreted with some caution. These findings and
their implications are further discussed in the following section.
Discussion
Findings from the current study are numerous and provide a
significant contribution to this area of research. First, we have
replicated the survival advantage in memory, when comparing
the effects of survival-relevance ratings against pleasantness
ratings and new color-naming conditions. Importantly, this
advantage was not due to any significant difference in RTs or
ratings during encoding. However, results from the scenario rat-
ings indicate that the survival advantage may be due, in part, to
relevance rating being a more imageable task. There was some
evidence that survival-relevance rating may be a more interesting
task as well. In other words, the encoding portion of the task is
likely to be the most critical portion of the task, overall.
Findings from the color-naming conditions were novel to
this paradigm. First, recall performance in these conditions was
significantly worse than the survival-relevance and pleasant-
ness rating conditions. Encouraging participants to consider a
survival situation while color naming impaired later recall per-
formance. Importantly, there is a precedent for this pattern of
data within the survival literature. In a study examining the role
of cognitive load in the survival advantage, Kroneisen, Rum-
mel, and Erdfelder (2013) found that increasing load with an
additional task reduced word recall and eliminated the survival
advantage. Similarly, when comparing recall performance in the
current study across the color-naming conditions, differences in
recall performance were minimal. In addition, as was the case
with Kroenisen et al. (2013), recall performance was significantly
impaired, with participants in our three color-naming conditions
recalling less than 10% of the word list (near floor performance).
Particularly, poor recall, with little variation across these condi-
tions, indicates that the survival advantage may rely on additional
processing, relative to less effortful control conditions.
Results also indicate that survival processing did not moti-
vate better color-naming performance, relative to the baseline
color-naming condition. When comparing word color-naming
accuracy, participants who read the survival passage actually
performed numerically worse than those who had not read the
survival passage. Similarly, participants who read the survival
passage before engaging in the color-naming task experienced
a larger amount of interference than participants who had not
read the survival passage. As differences in the magnitude of
color-naming interference were not significant (a failure to
replicate effects reported by Besner et al., 1997), our interpre-
tations of these findings are cautious. While sample size may
account for some portion of null effects, the reduction in Stroop

interference has been demonstrated with conditions having as
few as 16 participants (Besner, 2001). Thus, our findings may
be the result of a sizable difference in design, given the addi-
tional survival scenario presented to two of the three color-
naming conditions.
With respect to both survival-processing and color-naming
interference, it is possible that the incongruent items (e.g., a
green orange or blue broccoli) were more difficult to concep-
tualize, as they violated the laws of nature as well as our parti-
cipants' expectations from previous experiences with oranges
and broccoli. Thus, these participants may have been particu-
larly preoccupied by these items, with greater interference indi-
cating poorer performance. Importantly, processing this
discrepancy between an object's typical color and its color
during the task did not increase recall performance (nor did it
significantly slow RTs).
However, can poorer performance in a color-naming task be
considered adaptive? Perhaps coming across an unusual fruit or
vegetable requires additional inspection, to ensure it is safe to
ingest, as our general pattern of interference data from the
color-naming task would indicate. In other words, it may be
the case that being in a survival setting puts us ``on high alert''
to find good nutrients. Likewise, our intrusion analyses indicate
that participants who read the survival passage recalled more
survival-relevant intrusions than those who had not read the
survival passage. We surmise that these false memories are a
strong indicator that survival processing encourages spreading
activation from the related words to other words that would be
useful in survival situations (e.g., a knife). These findings have
been observed in similar memory studies, such as those within
the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm, with both
adults and children (Howe & Derbish, 2010; Otgaar & Smeets,
2010). There are many examples of similar ``errors'' within the
memory literature, and several of them have similar adaptive
value. For example, a child's tendency to imitate or defer to an
adult's opinion or memory provides them with unique advan-
tages. For one, source-monitoring errors provide a valuable
memory boost: A young child observes an adult perform a task
yet falsely attributes the action to themselves, leading to
increased elaboration and better memory (see Sellers & Bjork-
lund, 2014, for a review).
Sellers and Bjorklund (2014) have hypothesized that nega-
tive emotions, such as those related to fearing the consequences
of a survival situation, may be driving these effects. Thus, these
seemingly negative consequences of survival processing may
actually have adaptive value when conceptualized within both
memory and evolutionary theories. Together, they indicate that
survival processing provides a large number of benefits, which
can only be studied when exploring new tasks and experimental
manipulations.
Implications and Future Directions
Although these results are not the most straightforward exam-
ples of a survival advantage, we believe that they greatly
extend the original conception of the advantage (Nairne
et al., 2007). In fact, it may be the case that survival processing
has far-reaching implications for understanding behavior, such
as color-naming performance described in the current study.
Thus, this area of literature would greatly benefit from addi-
tional studies investigating the generalizability of the survival
advantage to new tasks and experimental procedures, particu-
larly those with adaptive value, such as the unconventional
intrusion findings reported in the current study. The number
of experiments designed to study the limits of the advantage are
greatly outnumbered by the number of experiments designed to
replicate the advantage with different control conditions, par-
ticipant populations, or modified passages (for a review, see
Kazanas & Altarriba, 2015). Thus, we encourage greater explo-
ration of how the advantage fares with tasks that tap into cog-
nitive domains other than episodic memory (e.g., attention,
working memory, etc.). Additional research might also explore
real-world applications or more realistic situations for adult-
age populations (e.g., the first day of school at a new university,
starting a new job, etc.). Perhaps future work would benefit
from additional control conditions, such as these familiar situa-
tions, to compare memory following survival and nonsurvival
processing. A limitation of our study lies in our lack of a
situation-based control condition, although we did include a
pleasantness rating task.
We also encourage additional research investigating the
relationship between considering ones' survival needs and
identifying items by color. For example, how would results
from a study using picture stimuli (e.g., having participants
name the color of a red apple versus a blue apple) compare
with our results using words? If participants are concerned
about a food shortage, would an unusually colored piece of
fruit draw more attentional resources? In addition, would some
colors capture more attention and increase memorability for
those objects? Would participants categorize objects by color
and recall them together? How might animacy play a role in
this paradigm? For example, children as young as 4 years old
detect snakes in visual search tasks faster when the snakes are
presented in color, rather than gray scale (Hayakawa, Kawai, &
Masataka, 2011). Findings from studies conducted with adult
participants are equally relevant: Color naming is significantly
faster when snakes are presented--a threatening stimulus--
relative to flowers (Shibasaki, Isomura, & Masataka, 2014).
Finally, we encourage additional investigations related to those
conducted by Besner et al. (1997). Our interference data resem-
ble their pattern of data, encouraging additional research
regarding this phenomenon. We recommend that researchers
assess whether the reduction in Stroop interference reported by
Besner et al. (1997) replicates when participants are simulta-
neously completing other tasks, as we attempted here, using
survival processing. These are just a few potential research
questions to continue this interesting area of inquiry.
Conclusion
Our overall findings indicate that engaging in survival process-
ing increases memory for a set of unrelated words. In addition,
6 Evolutionary Psychology
this task led participants to spend more time on words that were
presented in incongruent colors, relative to participants who
were not thinking about the survival scenario. These results
support a survival advantage specifically guided by ancestral
priorities: Our ancestors would have benefited from turning
their attention toward objects that violated their expectations,
especially if they were in danger or needed to quickly gather
survival materials. Additionally, having carefully classified
and analyzed participants' intrusions--a measure often associ-
ated with false memory--we believe that survival processing
may also promote spreading activation from one survival item
to an entire set of related items. Together, these findings repli-
cate the survival advantage and extend its generalizability to a
new task with adaptive value.
