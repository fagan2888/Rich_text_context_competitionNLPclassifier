Objectives. We explore the potential of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program to reduce poverty among
elderly women. We develop a methodological framework that compares how well various reform proposals are targeted to
reducing poverty among elderly women.
Methods. Using a microsimulation model and survey data matched to SSI administrative records, we model the effects
of eight alternative policies on current and potential SSI recipients. We develop an evaluation methodology that
systematically compares poverty outcomes, using multiple measures of effectiveness, at given levels of program
expansion.
Results. All but two of the SSI reforms are clearly more target efficient at various degrees of simulated program
expansion than popular proposals to reform Social Security. For a given cost increase, modifying the SSI asset test is the
most effective option for reducing severe poverty among elderly women, but several reforms of the SSI income test are
also highly effective.
Discussion. The SSI program is target efficient in providing a broad safety net to economically vulnerable elderly
women. The relationship between SSI and Social Security and the relationship between the SSI asset and income tests
have to be reevaluated to make the program more effective and appropriate to changing household structure and work
patterns among the elderly population.
POVERTY has declined among the elderly population over
the past 30 years, but the rate for elderly women remains
almost twice as high as that for men. Factors contributing to
lower Social Security benefits and higher poverty among
elderly women include lower lifetime earnings, the breakdown
of the nuclear family, fewer years spent in the labor force,
relatively long life expectancy, lower likelihood of receiving
pension income, and lower financial net worth. In addition,
elderly women are less likely to be married than elderly men
and more likely to be widowed or divorced. The death of
a husband is followed by a decline in living standards and
substantial reductions in wealth (Hurd & Wise, 1987). Other
developments may increase the risk of poverty among elderly
women in the future. The ongoing secular shift from defined
benefit plans to defined contribution plans means that re-
tirement income is increasingly vulnerable to market risk and
being cashed out upon job change. Social Security reform pro-
posals involving individual accounts could add an additional
element of market risk.
The progressive benefit formula embedded in the Social
Security system involves a redistribution of income from men
to women; however, a large part of these transfers are within
families and thus do not generally accrue to poor women
(Gustman & Steinmeier, 2000). Because of this, it is difficult
for Social Security reform proposals to target benefits to the
poor elderly population or poor elderly women. Anzick and
Weaver (2001) look at five popular reform proposals focusing
on the widow(er) benefit and enhancing Social Security's
special minimum benefit. They estimated that only 14% to 37%
of new government spending would go toward the reduction of
poverty. Other proposals involve reallocating Social Security
benefits from couples to surviving widows (Burkhauser &
Smeeding, 1994; Iams & Sandell, 1998; Sandell & Iams, 1997),
but they do not address the increasingly large group of never
married elderly women. An unintended side effect of this type
of reform is the loss of Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
benefits (and Medicaid) for some widows (Kijakazi & Primus,
2000).
The SSI program, by contrast, can target benefits to poor
elderly people generally and poor elderly women specifically
quite efficiently. Conceived as a scaled-down negative in-
come tax program focusing on the ``deserving poor,'' it is
a particularly important source of income for economically
vulnerable women. Elderly people in poverty receive approx-
imately 78% of all SSI benefits to the elderly population. Of
these benefits, 75% go to elderly women (considerably more
than half of all benefits paid to elderly people). This reflects the
population share of poor elderly women relative to all poor
elderly people (76%), as well as demographic and economic
factors related to economic vulnerability among elderly women.
Although SSI appears to be highly target efficient, only 34% of
elderly women in poverty received SSI in 1998 (all figures are
our calculations from the Survey of Income and Program
Participation).
Can the SSI program be used to further reduce poverty
among elderly women? The means-tested nature and the track
record of the SSI program suggest that it can; however, the
potential is limited by the structure of the program. The federal
SSI income guarantee is at a subpoverty level--$552 for
individuals and $829 for couples in 2003. State supplements
bring the total above the poverty level in only a minority of
states. In addition, the asset test cuts off SSI benefits (and often
eligibility for Medicaid), even for individuals with no other
countable income, at an arguably low level: $2,000 for

individuals and $3,000 for couples. These cutoffs are not
indexed to inflation, resulting in increasingly stringent criteria
in real terms. Another limiting feature of the SSI program is that
assets and income are treated differently, yet elderly people
often trade assets for income through annuities.
Although the SSI program appears to be highly target
efficient, it is unable to alleviate a large portion of poverty
among elderly women. Both of these factors suggest excel-
lent potential for SSI reform as a tool of further reducing pov-
erty. However, it is not immediately obvious what kind of
SSI reform is most target efficient and consistent with the
demographic and economic trends of the 21st century. How
should SSI handle Social Security reform proposals with
unintended negative effects on SSI eligibility, such as proposals
with a defined contribution component that could disqualify
extremely poor people from SSI (Kijakazi & Primus, 2000)?
Does it make sense to have an income guarantee that is re-
latively higher for couples than for elderly individuals living
alone, while imposing a ``marriage penalty'' because cohabiting
couples are treated as if they were individuals living alone?
We present and implement a new methodology that should
be of help in considering the relative merits of alternative SSI
reforms. The cornerstone of our methodology is a cost-
equivalent comparison of alternative reform proposals and the
use of a coherent set of measures to evaluate poverty outcomes.
These features improve upon past studies in two ways. First, the
cost of alternative reform proposals differs widely, making it
impossible to say whether a costly intervention that reduces
poverty substantially is more or less effective than an
inexpensive alternative that reduces poverty less. (See the wide
array of differences in cost and poverty reduction outcomes in
Davies et al., 2002; McGarry, 2002; and Zedlewski & Meyer,
1989.) Second, the use of outcome measures is ad hoc and
varies across studies. Given the inherent arbitrariness of
aggregating individual welfare, it is more honest to provide
a multidimensional view of poverty outcomes than to favor
a single measure that is not inherently superior to other meas-
ures of distributional outcomes. We draw on a large literature
on poverty measurement, particularly the seminal work of Sen
(1976) and Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (1984).
We present a set of SSI policy simulations involving reform
proposals affecting both eligibility and benefits. Our results
and discussion provide a useful step toward understanding the
potential role of SSI in improving the safety net for elderly
women while considering program cost and spending efficiency.
METHODS
To be eligible for SSI, individuals must have limited assets
and limited monthly income. Individuals must also be cat-
egorically eligible based on age (65 or older) or disability. To
be asset eligible for SSI, countable assets must be below the
relevant thresholds of $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for
couples. Countable assets typically exclude the equity value
of one automobile and the value of the primary residence (if
owned). To be income eligible for SSI, countable income must
be below the applicable federal benefit rate (FBR) for the
individual or couple. The first $20 of unearned monthly income
is excluded from countable income based on the general in-
come exclusion rules. If unearned income is less than $20, the
exclusion (or remainder) applies to earned income. The earned
income exclusion provides for the exclusion of an additional
$65 of monthly earned income and half of earned income in
excess of the exclusion(s). Following these calculations, the
federal SSI benefit is equal to the difference between the FBR
and countable income.
Policy Interventions Tested
Modifications of the federal benefit rate (FBR). --The FBR is
the amount of benefits (income guarantee) provided to an
individual or couple with no countable income. The FBR is
indexed to inflation and is separately established for individuals
and couples. The FBR, in itself, does not provide poverty level
income.
The first intervention, increasing the FBR, would affect all
beneficiaries and would make some individuals and couples
with low assets but incomes above the current FBR eligible for
a small benefit (and Medicaid). Because it affects beneficiaries
across the board, relatively small increases in the FBR may
result in substantial increases in program cost.
Currently, the FBR for couples is 150% of the FBR for
individuals. This is substantially higher than the official poverty
line for a two-person family relative to a family of one. The
second policy intervention would increase the FBR for in-
dividuals only. Because women tend to outlive their husbands
and the proportion of widows is high among elderly women,
this approach should allocate a large proportion of additional
program funds to single elderly women.
Modifications of the general income exclusion (GIE). --The
GIE applies to the first $20 of income. Any unearned income
beyond $20 is offset by an equivalent benefit reduction. The
GIE is not indexed to inflation; therefore, its value has eroded
over time. The low value of the GIE is consistent with the social
safety net nature of the SSI program. However, this results in
the lack of recognition of past work efforts that may be reflected
in Social Security payments.
The third intervention involves increasing the GIE. Without
other changes, increasing the GIE would not affect the SSI
benefits of elderly individuals with no countable income, who
represent the poorest segment of SSI's target population. It
would increase the benefits of current elderly SSI beneficiaries
with income above the GIE limit, and it would make some
people eligible who are currently ineligible because of high
income.
As an alternative to the GIE intervention, a fourth in-
tervention creates a Social Security income exclusion while
leaving the GIE for sources other than Social Security unaf-
fected. This intervention targets additional resources on those
elderly people who have Social Security income, and it pro-
vides higher benefits to those who have higher Social Security
incomes. The rationale is that past work effort reflected in
Social Security benefits should be rewarded. In addition, the
approach can be partly justified by the administrative simplicity
of accounting for Social Security income.
Modifications of the earned income exclusion (EIE). --Under
current SSI rules, any remainder of the GIE after consideration

of unearned income can be used to exclude earned income. The
EIE provides for the exclusion of an additional $65 of earned
income, along with 50% of any remaining earned income. The
fifth and sixth interventions increase the $65 earned income
exclusion and reduce the 50% earned income tax rate, respec-
tively. Because labor force participation among the elderly
population tends to be low under current conditions, these
interventions are expected to have only modest effects.
Modifications of the asset test. --The asset rules are justified
on the grounds that SSI provides a safety net of last resort;
people with assets should spend them before turning to public
assistance. Nevertheless, people with no or limited income may
be ineligible if countable assets exceed the thresholds.
The SSI asset test has been criticized on several grounds. The
current SSI asset test provides a strong incentive to spend down
assets (Neumark & Powers, 1998) and eliminates the ability of
recipients to preserve a fund for emergencies. In addition, it
treats individuals differently depending on the form of their
retirement savings. A person with a given level of income
might qualify for SSI if the source of income is Social Security
or an annuity, but this person might not qualify if the income
source is an individual retirement account, a savings account, or
an investment that can produce an equivalent income stream.
As Kijakazi and Primus (2000) noted, this could become
a major barrier to SSI participation as defined-contribution
plans grow in popularity and under Social Security reform
scenarios involving mandatory individual accounts.
The seventh intervention involves increasing the asset
threshold. It preserves the current program approach in which
the couple asset threshold is equal to 150% of the individual
asset threshold. This intervention does not change the benefits
or income of people who already qualify for SSI, but it allows
people with low income and modest assets to qualify for SSI.
Thus, this intervention might substantially increase the income
of some of the poorest elderly.
The final intervention would transform the asset test into
an integral part of the SSI income determination process, based
on the notion that assets can be seen as equivalent to the in-
come they are capable of producing. While formally eliminat-
ing the asset test, the intervention would create an income debit
that counts x% of countable assets against the income test.
The value of x can be theoretically justified or empirically
determined. This intervention has similar properties as the
previous one, except that it eliminates the discrete jump from
benefits to no benefits associated with the asset threshold
and allows people with much higher asset levels to qualify
for SSI.
Data
The SSI eligibility and participation models are based on the
1990 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation
(SIPP) matched to administrative data from the Social Security
Administration (SSA). All estimates pertain to the 1991 non-
institutionalized U.S. population. The SIPP provides detailed
data on the sources and amounts of monthly income and as-
sets, which are crucial to the estimation of SSI eligibility. We
also utilize detailed SIPP data on demographic characteristics
and household composition. We replace survey measures of
SSI participation and benefits with SSA administrative data,
which are of high quality as a result of their central role in the
administration of the SSI program (Huynh, Rupp, & Sears,
2002).
Eligibility and Participation Models
We focus on all elderly individuals who meet the SSI income
and asset eligibility criteria. For individuals who live with their
spouse, SSI eligibility also depends on the resources and in-
come of the spouse. Consequently, we use the characteristics of
``family units'' rather than individual characteristics per se to
estimate SSI financial eligibility.
We develop a probit model to estimate SSI participation for
SSI-eligible elderly units. We derive the dependent variable,
SSI participation status, from SSA administrative records. All
other variables are taken from the SIPP. Following McGarry
(1996), the principal determinant of SSI participation is the
expected SSI benefit. Following Davies and colleagues (2002),
we define expected SSI benefits as the sum of the potential
federal SSI benefit calculated by the SSI eligibility model, plus
the maximum state SSI supplement. Other covariates include
demographic and economic characteristics of the unit head,
such as age, gender, race or ethnicity, marital status, educa-
tional attainment, home ownership, place of birth (United
States or elsewhere), U.S. citizenship, and health. We use
average state Medicaid expenditures on SSI recipients to
approximate the effect of Medicaid on SSI participation. A
vector of state dummy variables is included to control for un-
measured state-specific effects on SSI participation.
Simulation Methodology
We estimate participation probabilities under the new
program rules by applying the coefficients from the baseline
participation model to the characteristics of eligibles under the
new program rules. Base-case and simulation-case estimates
of the number of participants are derived by summing the
estimated participation probabilities across all eligible elderly
women using sample weights.
The cornerstone of our methodology is a computationally
feasible, iterative method of running a large number of
simulations that converge upon a specified cost target. The
parameter values from the simulations thus support compar-
isons of cost-equivalent policy alternatives. For example, if we
are considering a 5% increase in program costs to be achieved
by adjusting the FBR, the simulation iterates over potential
values of the FBR until a value is found that is expected to
generate a 5% increase in program cost. The same process and
cost target is used for all other simulated changes to the SSI
program parameters, thus producing a grid of cost-equivalent
outcomes that can be compared against each other in a con-
sistent fashion.
The simulations use a search algorithm to find the
appropriate parameter values. The input is a predetermined
level of program cost; the output is the value of the program
parameter of interest, such as the FBR. The algorithm computes
the simulated cost based on an initial guess of the parameter
value and compares it with the predetermined target program
cost. Then, the algorithm makes a linear adjustment to the pa-
rameter based on these two data points (the base case and the
guess) and repeats the process. Specifically, the change in the
SSI, POVERTY, AND ELDERLY WOMEN S361
parameter is computed to make the ratio of the desired change
in the parameter (base case to target) to the actual change in the
parameter (base case to guess) equal the ratio of the desired
change in cost (base case to target cost level) to the actual
change in cost (base case to guess). When the simulated cost is
within $100,000 of the target cost, the algorithm accepts the
parameter value and the iteration ceases. The $100,000 value
represents 0.05% of baseline program costs.
The results we present focus specifically on poverty effects
for elderly women; however, cost-equivalent policy changes are
identified by considering program cost effects for all elderly
individuals, including men. We have chosen this approach
because we do not envision any of the policy alternatives to be
applied to women only. We consider the robustness of our
results with respect to gender, and we argue that final policy
decisions should be made based on a consideration of the
effects on both men and women. We also note that the poverty
measures we report do not focus specifically on elderly women
who participate in the SSI program. Rather, the base for the
poverty measures is the sample of all elderly women. Although
the SSI program has a large and increasing component target-
ing nonelderly disabled people (including children), in this ar-
ticle we focus on the elderly population alone. It would be
worthwhile to address the robustness of our results with respect
to the nonelderly population and to reassess whether uniform
financial eligibility rules make sense for the elderly and
disabled components of the SSI program. However, the dis-
ability component of the program raises complex measurement
and analytic issues that merit a separate study. Our focus here is
on the role of SSI reform in alleviating poverty among elderly
women.
Our methodology makes a number of simplifying assump-
tions. Consistent with previous studies (Davies et al., 2002;
McGarry, 2002), the model is static, does not incorporate
potential behavioral effects of the interventions, and assumes
that all changes occur instantaneously. The possibility of long-
term behavioral changes would be most likely in the context of
incentives for spending down assets or increasing work
behavior, particularly in the 20% cost increase simulations.
For the 1%, 3%, and 5% cost increase simulations, we do not
expect behavioral effects to be of significant concern. Our esti-
mates are conditional on the characteristics of the population
underlying the simulations. The effects of the policy changes
may be altered in the future if, for example, the size and
composition of the target population change. In addition, we
do not model the potentially complex interactions between
the federal SSI program and state SSI supplements or other
programs such as Food Stamps and Medicaid. The interven-
tions examined by Zedlewski and Meyer (1989) generally
result in trivial effects on Food Stamp expenditures. Medicaid
is likely to be the most important element of non-SSI cost
associated with the policy interventions we test. Finally, we
note that the estimated outcomes are subject to uncertainty
resulting from both sampling error and errors in predictions of
participation.
Poverty Measures
Given the inherent arbitrariness of aggregating individual
welfare, we provide a multidimensional view of poverty
outcomes rather than focusing on a single measure that is not
unambiguously superior to other available measures. We mea-
sure the poverty-reducing effects of each potential interven-
tion based on the Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (1984) class of
poverty measures. The general formulation of the Foster, Greer,
and Thorbecke (FGT) class of indices is
FGTa

n
X
q
i¼1
zi
ÿ yi
zi
 
a

where zi
is the poverty threshold (adjusted for family size), yi
is
the income of the ith observation, n is the number of individuals
in the population, and q is the number of poor individuals in the
population (i.e., individuals for whom yi
, zi
). We use three
special cases:
FGT0
[ poverty rate (a ¼ 0),
FGT1
[ normalized poverty gap (a ¼ 1), and
FGT2
[ FGT index (a ¼ 2).
One advantage of the FGT class of indices is that, although
the choice of a is somewhat arbitrary, the formulation of the
indices is explicit. Moreover, the parameter a represents
poverty aversion. For a ¼ 2, greater weight is given to the
poorest poor relative to those who are only slightly below the
poverty threshold (Foster et al., 1984).
Each poverty measure described here has strengths and
limitations. The poverty rate measures the proportion of a
population with incomes below the official poverty threshold.
The change in the poverty rate reflects only movements across
the poverty line and is not sensitive to increases (or decreases)
that occur in the income of the poor below the poverty line.
The poverty gap is the difference between the official U.S.
poverty threshold and family income, summed across all
elderly women below the poverty threshold. It can be in-
terpreted as the minimum amount of money needed to elim-
inate poverty, assuming no behavioral changes. Although it
captures the overall magnitude of poverty in a given population,
the poverty gap ignores the severity of poverty by giving equal
weight to a change in income for individuals just below the
poverty line and individuals with the lowest incomes.
The FGT2
index is a poverty index that accounts for income
inequality among the poor. It provides greater weight to poverty
among the poorest poor, and the index value is comparatively
low for interventions that aid those at the bottom of the income
distribution. Although the choice of a¼ 2 for the FGT2
index is
arbitrary, it has the advantage of being mathematically related
to the poverty rate and poverty gap. Any value of a . 1 con-
siders the severity of poverty. As a increases, the weight given
to the severity of poverty increases. In the limiting case as a
approaches infinity, the index collapses to a simple formula that
is solely a function of the proportion of individuals with zero
income.
When analyzing the results of the policy simulations, we pre-
sent the percentage change between the base case and the simu-
lation case in the poverty rate, the poverty gap, and the FGT2
index for elderly women. We also present figures on the
proportion of benefits that would be received by poor elderly
women, poor elderly men, and the nonpoor elderly population
as an alternative way of demonstrating relative effectiveness.

RESULTS
Table 1 provides basic descriptive statistics on demographic,
financial, and health variables for our sample of elderly women
in 1991, by SSI eligibility and participation status. Roughly 9%
of the U.S. noninstitutional elderly female population is eligible
for SSI benefits. Compared with all elderly women, a larger
proportion of eligible elderly women is divorced, separated, or
widowed, and a smaller proportion is married. Eligible elderly
women are more likely than elderly women overall to be African
American, Hispanic, poorly educated, and in poor health.
Generally, the data show that elderly SSI-eligible women are
worse off financially than elderly women overall. Compared
with 13.5% of all elderly women, 71% of elderly SSI-eligible
women live in poverty. A lower percentage have positive SSI-
countable assets and income, and the median amount among
those with positive assets and income is substantially lower for
eligible elderly women compared with all elderly women.
Based on the data in Table 1, the SSI participation rate among
eligible elderly women is 57.8%. Previous studies have
documented similarly low participation rates among elderly
people (Davies et al., 2002; McGarry, 1996, 2002; Zedlewski &
Meyer, 1989). Over half of elderly female participants are

SSI, POVERTY, AND ELDERLY WOMEN S363
widowed, over 84% have less than a high school education,
and 34% are in poor health. Elderly female participants are
more financially disadvantaged than elderly women as a whole.
Although 74% receive Social Security income, the median
monthly benefit among recipients is only $278. The average SSI
benefit among elderly female participants is $181 per month
(not shown). Table 1 also shows that eligible female participants
are slightly less likely to be in poverty than all eligible women,
reflecting the success of the SSI program in reducing poverty.
The last three columns of Table 1 present data for elderly
women who are not eligible for SSI benefits. The columns for
elderly women who are income eligible only and resource
eligible only show the characteristics of those who might
become eligible for SSI as a result of the interventions we test.
Those who meet only the SSI income eligibility criteria have
low median SSI-countable monthly incomes, low median
Social Security income, and high median SSI-countable assets.
Their poverty rate (84.2%) is the highest of all groups, sug-
gesting that these elderly women would benefit greatly from
interventions targeting the SSI asset test. Elderly women who
meet only the resource eligibility criteria have low median SSI-
countable assets, high median SSI-countable monthly incomes,
and high median Social Security income. Although this group
has a relatively low poverty rate, it represents over 3.5 million
elderly women who might benefit from interventions target-
ing the SSI FBR or income exclusions. By contrast, those
elderly women who meet neither the SSI income nor resource
eligibility criteria have a poverty rate of only 2.1% and have
very high median SSI-countable income and assets. Thus, the
SSI eligibility criteria are extremely effective in screening out
elderly women who are clearly not poor.
Table 2 presents the results of the participation model, with
bootstrapped standard errors to account for the complex SIPP
sample design. The key result is that expected SSI benefits are
positively and significantly related to the likelihood of SSI
participation. The marginal effect indicates that a $100 increase
in benefits would increase the overall probability of participa-
tion by 5 percentage points. The U.S. born appear to be more
likely to participate than immigrants. U.S. citizenship, how-
ever, is negatively related to SSI participation. Thus, because
everyone born in the United States is a citizen, the combined
effect is small at best. Among immigrants, the participation
probability varies by entry cohort. The data suggest that ob-
taining U.S. citizenship offsets the possibly higher SSI par-
ticipation among immigrants. Eligibles who require personal
care and who had a greater number of doctor visits in the
previous 12 months are more likely to participate. The esti-
mated coefficients on the state dummy variables are not pre-

not have an intuitively obvious meaning; however, lower
values represent less poverty. Comparing all the values
presented in Table 3, we find it clear that elderly women in
1991 experienced poverty to a greater degree than the elderly
population in general. The major qualitative conclusion from
this table is that the financial situation of elderly women is
unambiguously worse compared with all elderly people, and
hence elderly men. Thus, the anticipated effects of alternative
SSI reform proposals on elderly women are of particular policy
relevance.
Table 4 gives the values of the parameters representing
program rules that produce simulations with given increases in
SSI expenditures. Each cell represents a simulation and each
column a series of simulations at a specific cost level. For
example, the first row shows that the base-case value of the
individual FBR is $407 ($610 for couples), that a value of $408
($612 for couples) produces a 1% cost increase, and so on.
Cells labeled ``not possible'' indicate that feasible values of that
parameter cannot produce a simulation at that cost level. This
can occur either because of inherent bounds on the given
parameter or because at some cost increase level there are no
more potential participants who might be helped by further
increasing the given program parameter.
The cost-equivalent policy options are associated with
changes in parameter values of quite different magnitudes.
For example, a 3% program cost increase is associated with
only a $5 increase in the FBR for individuals (slightly more
than 1%), whereas the same 3% cost increase is associated
with a $5,745 increase in the asset threshold for individuals
(an increase of 287%). The relationship between the magnitude
of the parameter change and the associated cost increase is
influenced by the manner in which the parameter change affects
eligibility, the level of individual benefits, participation, and
distributional features of the eligible population. Increasing the
asset threshold, for example, has no effect on the benefit level
of existing participants. All of the additional program cost goes
to benefits for previously ineligible units who become eligible
participants. Increasing the FBR directly increases benefits for
all existing participants and induces participation through in-
creasing eligibility and higher participation propensities (by
means of increased benefits).
The simulated parameter values for the Social Security
income exclusion are similar to the simulated values of the GIE
at each cost level. In fact, the Social Security income exclusion
acts as a targeted increase in the GIE. The inflation-adjusted
value of the simulated Social Security income exclusion, even
for a 20% cost increase, is much lower than the exclusion
proposed by some. For example, Smeeding, Estes, and Glasse
(1999) proposed a $175 Social Security income exclusion. We
estimate that a $60 Social Security income exclusion (in 1991
dollars) would increase SSI program costs for the elderly
population by 20%. This is roughly equivalent to the $80
exclusion proposed by Kijakazi and Primus (2000) after
inflation is accounted for.
Table 5 presents the implications of the simulations in terms
of poverty among elderly women. It presents the percentage
change between the base case and the simulations for the
poverty rate, poverty gap, and FGT2
index. The results are
grouped by outcome measure. Each column represents a specific
change in federal SSI program costs.
The first panel shows changes in poverty rates. The mag-
nitudes of simulated changes are generally inconsequential
and indistinguishable from each other, indicating that the
changes that are produced by these kinds of interventions
generally do not move elderly women from below the poverty
threshold to above it. This is not surprising because the

individual (couple) FBR is below the poverty threshold for one
(two) person families.
The second panel of Table 5 illustrates the changes in the
poverty gap that correspond to each intervention. In contrast to
the poverty rate, the changes in the poverty gap vary across
interventions and the magnitudes are substantial. The inter-
ventions are not all equally effective, however. The two
simulations involving the asset test stand out from the rest in
terms of reducing the poverty gap. This is true at the 1%, 3%,
and 5% levels of cost increases. It is not feasible to change the
asset test to produce a 20% cost increase; a simulation of the
complete removal of the asset test produced a cost increase
of only 8% (not shown). The large effects associated with
changing the asset test are remarkable in light of the results of
previous studies. For example, eliminating the asset test has the
smallest poverty gap reduction of any of the changes simulated
by McGarry (2002). We find that, on a cost-equivalent basis,
the simulations involving changing the asset test display
comparatively impressive results.
A general pattern of the relative effectiveness of the various
interventions in reducing the poverty gap can be discerned from
Table 5. Behind the two involving the asset test is a second
group of interventions that includes increasing the FBR,
increasing the individual FBR only, increasing the GIE, and
creating a Social Security income exclusion. Finally, a third
group of interventions includes the two simulations involving
the EIE, which are clearly the least effective. These patterns
hold at all feasible cost levels.
The third panel of Table 5 shows percentage changes in the
FGT2
index. A negative change indicates a decrease in poverty.
The interventions can be grouped into the same three categories
as for the poverty gap. That is, the two interventions involving
the asset test are the most effective, there is a middle group of
somewhat less effective interventions, and the two interventions
involving the EIE are the least effective. Thus, using a measure
that emphasizes income changes at the bottom of the income
distribution does not change the ordering of the results; how-
ever, the asset test interventions stand out even more when the
FGT2
measure is used.
Although the results discussed herein are for elderly women
only, we argue that final policy decisions should be based on
a consideration of the effects on both men and women. Table 6
presents the proportion of additional dollars that would be
received by poor elderly women, poor elderly men, and
nonpoor elderly people (for the 5% cost increase scenario).
Consistent with previous results, the two interventions in-
volving the asset test would direct a relatively large proportion
of additional spending to elderly women and men in poverty.
The two earned income exclusion interventions would largely
direct additional spending to elderly people who are not in
poverty. The ranking of the overall target efficiency of the
various interventions (proportion going to poor women and
men combined) is the same as the ranking for women alone.
Thus our results are highly robust by gender. Table 6 also
shows that the proportion of additional spending going to poor
elderly women and men for each of the interventions is largely

a function of the gender distribution of the elderly poor. The
one exception to this is the intervention that increases the
federal benefit for individuals only, which disproportionately
targets poor elderly women. This reflects the high proportion of
widowed women among the elderly poor as well as the growing
proportion of never-married elderly women.
DISCUSSION
In this article, using a new methodology of cost-equivalent
comparisons, we analyze the potential of the SSI program to
serve as a cost-effective way of strengthening income security
among elderly women. We identify several highly target-
efficient policy options, and we unambiguously find that re-
forming the SSI asset test is the most effective intervention.
What is the potential of SSI reform for enhancing the social
safety net for elderly women in the 21st century? To answer
this question it is necessary to put SSI reform in the broader
context of Social Security reform and other important changes
to society and the economy.
Perhaps the Achilles' heel of successful Social Security
reform is the need to find cost-effective solutions to counter
economic vulnerability among the elderly population that may
arise from personal accounts allowing for investments in the
stock market, the shift from defined benefit pension plans to
defined contribution plans (also partially invested in stocks), and
the secular shift to a society of unrelated or loosely related
individuals. By contrast, our study has found that SSI reform
can be structured in a highly target-efficient way. Social Security
reform in this respect is inherently limited for several reasons. It
does not address the economic vulnerability of population
subgroups outside of the Social Security system. Moreover, it
does not address poverty arising from poor investment outcomes
from individual accounts. Reforms focusing on establishing
a minimum Social Security benefit are inherently limited
because the structure of Social Security is closely tied to
earnings histories--those with sporadic work histories may not
be sufficiently protected under such proposals. Proposals
focusing on widows are limited to a subgroup, albeit an
important one, but also one that is becoming less important as
a result of the breakdown of the nuclear family and the increase
in female employment. Moreover, reforms related to Social
Security alone are poorly targeted (Anzick & Weaver, 2001)
because they ignore other sources of income and assets.
The major attraction of SSI for the elderly population as a tool
for fighting poverty is that it is a negative income tax targeted
directly on poor elderly people. Thus looking at Social Security
and SSI reform together is sensible, all the more so given that
the financing of the two programs is fundamentally different--
trust fund versus general revenues. Viewed in isolation, some
reforms may appear costless because they simply shift costs to
a different pot of funds.
The current SSI program, however, is not as effective at
fighting poverty as it could be. One of the most important reasons
is the asset test. From an antipoverty standpoint, the current SSI
asset test has two major weaknesses. First, rather than gradually
phasing out SSI benefits as asset levels increase, there is a cliff at
the threshold, a threshold that is very low relative to the SSI
income guarantee. Second, there is no consideration given to the
income-producing potential of financial assets other than
passbook savings and dividend-producing assets. Thus eligibil-
ity for SSI benefits depends not only on the value but also the
form of financial assets. These problems may not have been
substantial in the 1970s, a time when few people invested in the
stock market and defined benefit plans were dominant. Both of
these issues will become increasingly important in the decades
ahead, especially if Social Security reforms oriented toward
individual equity investments are implemented.
Given these problems, it is no surprise that our empirical
results show that poverty among elderly women is by far the
highest among those who are income eligible, but have assets
above the asset threshold. We tested two asset reform options,
both of which are highly target efficient. The first is to simply
increase the asset threshold. This approach, however, does not
eliminate the threshold cliff or address the income-producing
potential of assets. The second is to ``tax'' assets by converting
asset values to an imputed income stream that is counted
against the FBR, while eliminating the threshold requirement--
the cliff. On a cost-equivalent basis, the second approach tends
to be slightly better in reducing poverty among elderly women.
It also has appealing incentive properties. In addition, a reason-
able argument can be made to set the asset ``tax'' rate close to
the annuitized value of the asset.
Another important reform approach involves changing the
economies of scale assumptions embedded in the SSI benefit
formula. This is addressed by the reform to increase the
individual FBR only. As expected, this approach consistently
produced better results for elderly women than increasing

the FBR across the board. The couple FBR is 150% of the
individual FBR. If the individual in question is living alone,
this implies a FBR for couples that assumes weaker scale
economies than are embedded in the official poverty threshold
measure.
There is also an SSI marriage penalty arising from the fact
that the program does not currently acknowledge economies of
scale arising from two or more unmarried adults living in the
same household. Thus, whereas the couple FBR is 150% of the
individual FBR, a cohabiting couple, if both qualify, would
receive benefits calculated on the basis of 200% of the
individual FBR. A promising direction for research might
involve simulations designed with an eye toward the better
alignment of the FBR applicable to persons in different
household structures and the economies of scale assumptions
of poverty measures.
Finally, we address the trade-off between targeting and
economic incentives, an issue that is particularly important in
the context of savings and work behavior. One of the attractive
aspects of asset test reform is that it would simultaneously
improve targeting and reduce perverse incentives to ``spend
down'' assets. However, as with any means-tested income
support program, there are clear trade-offs between targeting
and economic incentives. Most strikingly, although our results
show that liberalizing the EIE is an ineffective tool of reducing
poverty among the elderly population, it would undoubtedly
increase work incentives. Similarly, although creating a separate
SSI exclusion for Social Security income may be slightly less
target efficient than increasing the GIE, a Social Security
income exclusion should reduce lifetime work disincentives.
The work incentive issues may become increasingly important
as life expectancy increases, the Social Security normal
retirement age is raised, and increased work activity among
elderly people is facilitated by technological change. Thus,
although target efficiency should be a prime objective of
SSI reform, other factors such as work and savings incen-
tives, as well as administrative complexity, also have to be
considered.
