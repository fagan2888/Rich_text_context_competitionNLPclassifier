School Safety
The United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child
states that as well as an education, every child has the right to
be safe (United Nations, 2012). Despite this mandate, child
injuries are replacing infectious disease as the leading cause
of mortality in developing countries (Kozik et al., 1999).
Therefore, as one of the principal environments where chil-
dren spend extensive time during their formative years,
school safety should be effectively managed, promoted, and
prioritized. This is reflected in the breadth of discussion,
debate, and literature about school safety. However in
Thailand, school safety is generally considered to be of low
priority compared with other educational issues, with a lack
of effective policy, and with schools struggling to justify
safety costs. As a result, child injury is common in Thailand,
and according to Sitthi-amorn et al. (2006), approximately
6,000 children die from preventable injuries each year. While
these injuries do not necessarily occur at school, children
spend significant amounts of time within the school environ-
ment, and there is a growing demand for safe schools in
Thailand, along with associated parental expectations of
safety. Thailand has responded to child injury and mortality
through appropriate legislation (e.g., mandatory use of seat
belts and crash helmets), but it is argued that such laws are
not intrinsically effective, requiring enhanced awareness and
robust enforcement. In response, the Thai government rec-
ommends schools play a more active role in preventing child
injury by managing and promoting safety. As such, the edu-
cation system in Thailand represents a key component of
child injury reduction and safety promotion. However,
Thailand's school safety is geographically variable and sig-
nificantly dependent on each individual school's resources
and attitude toward safety. Budgetary constraints and a lack
of clear policy or related governmental guidance are key
issues affecting the management of safety in Thai schools.
The aim of this article is thus to present a framework aimed
at improving the management of school safety in Thailand,
specifically through the novel application of lean thinking to
reduce the barriers related to the cost and inefficiencies of
managing and promoting safety. This article hypothesizes
that the concept of lean thinking, which has been success-
fully utilized to reduce costs, waste, and improve service,

of a Lean Thinking Framework

Abstract
Child injuries are replacing infectious disease as the leading cause of mortality in developing countries. As school is one of
the environments where children spend significant time during their formative years, school safety should be effectively
managed, promoted, and prioritized. In Thailand however, school safety is considered to be of low priority compared with
other educational issues, lacking effective policy, and with schools struggling to justify safety costs. This article proposes a
novel application of lean thinking to control the cost, bureaucracy, and waste associated with managing and administering a
safe school. Through a case study in northern Thailand, one primary school's current safety scenario is reviewed with regard
to people, finance, and operations, before applying a lean framework to improve the handling of safety suggestions. Results
show significant capacity to improve the management of school safety, along with management implications and potential to
expand the framework beyond Thailand.

could also be applied to issues of school safety. The applica-
tion of lean thinking to school safety in Thailand has poten-
tial to cut costs, minimize the associated management
burden, and improve the levels of safety delivered to the rel-
evant stakeholders.
The State of School Safety in Thailand and
Associated Management Implications
There are a variety of definitions of what constitutes a safe
school, or which aspects of school safety should be managed,
promoted, and prioritized. For example, Hernandez, Floden,
and Bosworth (2010) suggest a safe school is a place free
from violence, and represented by an environment where
there is no perceived fear with respect to the school or its
disciplinary procedures. A general definition of a safe school
is one that provides a positive environment, allowing stu-
dents, teachers, staff, and visitors to interact without fear or
threats, and in a supportive way to achieve the educational
mission of the school while fostering and nurturing personal
growth (Butcher & Manning, 2005). Hull (2010) provides a
more practical and management-oriented elucidation of
school safety, stating that it includes the school's culture and
the appropriate training and resources to respond to threats
and hazards. Definitions also vary according to geographic
location, with U.S. school safety research chiefly focused on
violence and crime prevention (e.g., Heinen, Webb-Dempsey,
Moore, McClellan, & Friebel, 2007), while the European
perspective takes a wider viewpoint to include health, risk, a
safe learning environment, and lifelong learning related to
health and risk (European Agency for Safety and Health at
Work [EU-OSHA], 2009).
Defining school safety is often challenging, as the defini-
tion can encompass a wide remit of different themes, where
the separation of rhetoric versus reality becomes problem-
atic, and where a key difficulty is distinguishing between
personal beliefs and evidence-based research (Mayer &
Cornell, 2010). The most commonly noted aspects of school
safety in the literature are physical, psychological, environ-
mental, and social.
In terms of physical issues of school safety, violence and
bullying are commonly discussed in the literature. For exam-
ple, in a recent assimilation of school safety data, Dunlap
(2013) focuses particularly on school violence as the central
aspect of school safety. Literature often takes school vio-
lence as the contextual basis for school safety research and
aims to develop response mechanisms to crises (e.g.,
Kingshott & McKenzie, 2013). The school violence litera-
ture primarily focuses on schools in the United States, where
the effects of recent school shootings have prompted national
discussion regarding the safety of schools and wider social
issues, including gun laws (e.g., Jones, Waite, & Clements,
2012). As well as school violence, risk and injuries to chil-
dren form a central precept within the school safety litera-
ture. Injuries at school are often investigated with the primary
discussion and analysis aimed at reducing accidents or risk
(e.g., Scala, Gallagher, & Schneps, 1997), but such discus-
sion often neglects the management barriers associated with
creating a safe school, and does not necessarily consider the
potential fallacy of using only accident or injury statistics to
monitor school safety.
Psychologically, school safety is discussed in the litera-
ture with reference to how safe students feel at their school
(Mooij & Fettelaar, 2013). More recently, discussions regard-
ing the feeling of being safe at school have developed into
debates about how safe individuals feel in terms of gender
(e.g., Toomey, McGuire, & Russell, 2012), homosexuality
(e.g., Fleming, 2012; Vega, Crawford, & Pelt, 2012), and dis-
abilities (e.g., Boon et al., 2011).
In terms of the school environment, road safety predomi-
nates the literature and represents an important subset of
school safety research. This is a particularly important issue
in developing countries--For example, Hidayati, Liu, and
Montgomery (2012) focus on traffic flows as a key part of
improving school safety in Indonesia, while John, John, and
Bose (2012) illustrate that road safety and school transport in
India are a leading cause of injury. Others (e.g., Parusel &
McLaren, 2010) suggest that focusing on road safety creates
an illusion of a safe school and ignores wider safety issues at
school. This represents a key tenet of school safety literature,
where specific problems are often identified and analyzed,
but without consideration of the wider problem. For exam-
ple, focusing on school safety is unrealistic for schools in
developing countries where efforts are primarily centered on
raising educational standards.
As well as road safety, the school and its buildings are
considered instrumental to creating a safe school. A key con-
cept of invitational education theory (Purkey & Novak,
1996) suggests that the school should be an inviting place
across a set of five key areas (people, place, processes, poli-
cies, and programs). In response to this, attention has often
focused on creating a safe school environment, including the
school's buildings and surroundings (e.g., Stanley, Juhnke, &
Purkey, 2004). In relation to this, a small subset of school
safety literature investigates school safety in the context of
natural hazards, but this usually relates to specific geographic
locales, for example, in Taiwan, where typhoons are a com-
mon occurrence (e.g., Chen & Lee, 2012). Shaw and
Kobayashi (2001) suggest that schools can be used as a way
to reduce the wider impact of natural hazards, and focus on
India, Nepal, Indonesia, and Uzbekistan. Linking the schools
with their communities is often investigated in terms of its
impact and relationship with safety and violence in the wider
community (Ozer & Weinstein, 2004). There is strong evi-
dence that the safety of a particular school cannot be taken in
isolation, and is inseparable from the surrounding commu-
nity (Kitsantas, Ware, & Martinez-Arias, 2004).
The common aspect of school safety in the literature is its
diversity ranging from the school's environment to commu-
nity violence, natural hazards, and the psychological effects
Srichai et al. 3
of bullying. The diversity represents a challenge, particularly
for schools where the concept of school safety is nascent.
The issues with school safety research and literature are
highlighted by Furlong, Morrison, Skiba, and Cornell (2004),
who suggest that school safety research can only progress by
developing a core literature to critically assess the methods,
measurement, and analysis of school safety. In keeping with
these assertions, the research in this article aims not to
recount the specific safety problems experienced by schools
in Thailand but rather to develop a new way of thinking
about school safety and how best to manage it given the con-
text of budgetary constraints and raised awareness in
Thailand about the need for safer schools.
Although a variety of school safety definitions exist, in
this research, the remit of school safety relates to the physical
well-being of the pupils, the school environment, and road
safety. If all these factors are fulfilled, a school might be
judged as being safe (The Center for the Protection of
Children's Rights Foundation, 2007). However, achieving all
three aspects of school safety represents a considerable chal-
lenge with far-reaching management implications.
In Thailand, school safety lacks suitable guidance in the
form of governmental policy and is geographically frag-
mented, with safety effectiveness highly dependent on the
school's location, leadership, and financial status. In addi-
tion, educational priorities in Thai schools are focused pre-
dominantly on academic achievement as opposed to issues
of safety, which are largely considered as peripheral and less
important aspects of education. Although academic attain-
ment is regarded as a decisive factor determining educational
quality, United Nations Children's Fund (2009) argues that
children have the right to learn in a safe and healthy environ-
ment, and thus, governments have a clear obligation to pro-
vide such environments through appropriate frameworks,
guidance, and legislation.
Thailand's political focus over the past decade has been
firmly on economic development, which resulted in the
recent upgrade of its economic status from lower-middle to
upper-middle income economy (World Bank, 2011).
However, the focus on economic development has not
resulted in parallel upgrades to the education system, and
according to Hewison (2012), Thailand faces a shortage of
skilled labor, a lack of innovation, and an education system
that has continuously failed to deliver quality schooling. The
result is a persistent focus on raising academic, vocational,
and technical skill, but a lower prioritization of issues such as
school safety. For example, in 2009, the Thai Ministry of
Education (MoE) launched an economic stimulus package
for education (MoE, 2009), and of 11 key projects, including
teacher development, school quality, and school improve-
ment, there was no specific mention of promoting safety, of
developing and managing the school environment with
regard to the health and safety of pupils. The focus of this
54,000 million baht economic stimulus was primarily aimed
at generating economic benefits for Thailand via the educa-
tion system (MoE, 2009). This highlights Thailand's focus in
pursuing what it considers core aspects of education, while
largely ignoring the critical aspects required for safety man-
agement and promotion in schools.
The lack of ubiquity in Thailand's approach to school
safety means variance in the management and quality of
safety at local, regional, and national scales. This is partly
due to governmental decentralization in Thailand and the
resulting dependency on individual provinces to effectively
manage education, which has meant school safety policies
and guidelines are fragmented, and rely mainly on the stance
of local administrative organizations. For example, Article
24 of Thailand's 2003 Child Protection Act states that district
heads have a duty to protect children living within their juris-
diction, and the associated responsibility to inspect schools
in terms of safety. As part of the same Act, Article 63 states
that schools must provide guidance and training to promote
safety, yet in reality, this is not common.
According to the EU-OSHA (2009), four functional com-
ponents affect the management of school safety. These com-
ponents are shown in Table 1 along with an assessment of
Thailand's current position in achieving these based on a
review of the literature and policies in this area.

Table 1 indicates that in terms of safety, Thai schools suf-
fer from a lack of government policy as well as fragmented
and variable assistance from local administrative organiza-
tions. This means they must autonomously manage and
design their own school-level policies and approach to safety,
but often lack appropriate knowledge, experience, and moti-
vation. In ventures to remedy this, external organizations and
NGOs have attempted to promote and improve school safety
in Thailand. For example, The Alliance for Safe Children
(TASC) has implemented a safe school project to manage
safety and reduce child injury, while the United Nations
International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR)
launched the One Million Safe Schools initiative (UNISDR,
2011).
Perhaps unsurprisingly, there is also a significant differ-
ence in the safety approach between public and private
schools in Thailand. Private schools often use safety as a
differentiating factor when attracting new parents and stu-
dents, and in a competitive market environment, schools
must attract students to achieve sustainability (Smith,
1994). When choosing a private school, parents often visit
to explore the school, search for information about its edu-
cational quality, and pay considerable attention to safety
(Trump, 2012). The school selection process within the pri-
vate education sector thus provides an additional financial
impetus to ensure safety. However, school safety can be
costly in terms of resources, time, and processes, making
safety an unattractive proposition for schools. The biggest
barrier to effective school safety for public and private
schools in Thailand is the creation of an effective manage-
ment program to address safety. School safety is often over-
looked due to the significant management barriers and
burdens, including cost, efficiency, organizational strain,
and bureaucracy. In terms of cost, Hull (2010) argues from
the global perspective that budget cuts represent one of the
biggest threats to safety in educational environments. This
is particularly so for Thailand while attempting to balance
conflicting demands on its education system (Witte, 2000).
Based on a literature review and in-depth interviews with
15 leaders from schools in northern Thailand, seven key
management barriers to effective safety were identified in
Thai schools, which are illustrated in Figure 1, and
described in the corresponding sections.
The seven management barriers are key issues requiring
attention if schools in Thailand are to effectively implement
and sustain a focus on safety. Each of the seven components
is described independently, but in reality, they are inextrica-
bly linked.
Financial Implications.
Managing safety has considerable
financial implications, in terms of the intrinsic cost of safety-
related activities in the school, and the opportunity cost of
spending on safety, versus other school needs, such as staff
or academic development. The relatively intangible nature of
risk minimization and effective school safety adds to the
financial burden, and schools would often prefer to spend in
more visible ways. This is particularly true for private
schools where attracting parents and students is critical to the
school's sustainability.
Time.Managing safety in schools requires a significant
investment in time. This is set against a backdrop of existing
time constraints faced by school leadership, staff, and
teachers.
Leadership.Developing appropriate safety strategies and
disseminating these throughout the school require strong
and committed leadership to promote safety and motivate
all stakeholders in alignment with the safety strategy and
policy.
Communication.Communicating safety issues throughout
the school is an important aspect of creating and managing a
safe school. Such communication requires appropriate man-
agement and strategy to ensure the perception of safety is not
one of burden, but a realization of its vital importance to all
stakeholders.
Stakeholder Understanding. Effective safety requires the com-
mitment and participation of all school stakeholders. While
some stakeholders (e.g., parents) will be more willing to
align themselves with safety policy, others (e.g., leaders and
staff) may not fully understand the justification for safety, or
may feel it adds to their workload.

Thai schools.
Srichai et al. 5
Culture.Risk taking and safety policies vary according to
national cultures (Hofstede, 1991) and the Thai culture
toward safety is markedly different from other, more devel-
oped countries. While there is a well-established health and
safety culture in Europe and the United States, the notion of
health and safety in Thailand is still relatively nascent. This
often means school management faces resistance when
attempting to implement safety in a culture where it is not
traditionally considered important or necessary.
Commitment. The six management barriers presented so far
contribute to the issue of commitment. Effective safety
requires the commitment of all involved and achieving such
commitment is a substantial management challenge.
Together, these seven management challenges create inef-
ficiencies, waste, and costs for management when attempt-
ing to design, implement, and transform the school's
approach to safety. A need therefore exists to research and
develop new ways of approaching and managing school
safety. The research in this article suggests that a lean think-
ing management approach could be used to develop, imple-
ment, and transform school safety from a bureaucratic and
inefficient process to a streamlined, sustainable, and value-
adding school activity.
Lean Thinking to Improve School Safety
To reduce the inefficiencies, waste, and cost associated with
school safety, this article proposes a framework based on
lean thinking. Lean thinking tools emerged from lean manu-
facturing, which is an automobile-manufacturing process
pioneered in Japan during the 1980s and now utilized by
organizations globally. While lean manufacturing is quintes-
sentially associated with industry, and the physical produc-
tion of goods, lean thinking is a more recent philosophy with
proven credibility as a process reengineering methodology
(Radnor, Holweg, & Waring, 2012). The result is that lean
thinking has been adopted in a number of scenarios to reduce
waste, cut costs, and increase efficiency. Most notably, the
literature has indicated that lean thinking can have signifi-
cant impacts in health care settings, often being adopted in
hospitals to improve patient care while reducing the costs
and waste associated with providing quality health care (e.g.,
Chalice, 2007; Dart, 2011). Lean thinking utilization in
health care research and practice, along with the general
aims of eliminating waste and improving satisfaction, is
compatible with school safety, where waste could be reduced
and the satisfaction of parents and students could be
improved. Furthermore, the way in which a school is run in
terms of administration and internal climate directly affects
its safety (Anderson, 1998).
This research illustrates by way of a case study, how
school safety can be approached and managed in Thailand
using the principles of lean thinking to cut waste and improve
safety-related processes. The article reports on progress
toward developing an effective and efficient method to pro-
mote and manage school safety at a primary school in north-
ern Thailand.
Case Study and Method
Prior to outlining the case study details, it is necessary to
justify the selection of a case study approach as opposed to
other research methods.Although safety at school can be dis-
cussed from a conceptual or theoretical perspective, the
nature of school safety is intrinsically practical, with a need
to gather empirical evidence-based data (Astor, Guerra, &
Acker, 2010). Coupled with the practical aspects of school
safety, lean thinking is commonly an applied endeavor, with
practical application being frequently reported in the lean
thinking literature (Arlbjørn & Freytag, 2013). The inher-
ently practical and applied aspects of school safety and lean
thinking, along with the lack of information regarding school
safety in Thailand, suggested that a case study approach was
most effective.
Figure 2 shows the location of the case study, which is a
private school in northern Thailand approximately 30 min by
car from Thailand's largest northern city (Chiang Mai). The
school has been operational for 25 years, and aside from a
high-quality education, parents expect their children to be

safe. The school runs kindergarten and primary-level educa-
tion programs and is well known among parents in its catch-
ment area. With 1,420 students on roll, including 451
kindergarten and 969 primary students, and 98 teachers and
administrative staff, safety is a significant issue of concern
for the school and its reputation.
Productivity in the service sector trails manufacturing by
a significant margin (May, 2005) and the application of lean
thinking beyond manufacturing is being considered and
investigated by a wide variety of sectors and organizations.
The concept of lean thinking as applied to school safety
relates to the three main aspects affecting safety management
in the school (operations, finance, and people), and the three
corresponding aspects of lean thinking, which derive from
the Japanese words mura, muda, and muri. Muda is the cen-
tral precept, which represents waste, and in relation to school
safety correlates mainly to financial aspects of school safety,
such as wasted resources or budget. Mura refers to uneven-
ness (Manuele, 2007), and in terms of managing school
safety, refers to the unevenness in the practical and opera-
tional aspects of safety. For example, there might be incon-
sistencies in the way safety policies are implemented. Finally,
muri refers to strain (Radnor et al., 2012), and in transposing
the term to school safety, represents the organizational strain
in managing safety from the perspective of all the key stake-
holders (parents, students, teachers, and staff). For example,
muri relates to the additional workload teachers might face
when implementing school safety policies or processes. In
reality, these components are interlinked and can be applied
holistically to improve safety at the school, as shown in
Figure 3.
The focus in this article is the application of lean thinking
to manage safety-related suggestions in the school. Currently,
the school operates a safety recommendation/suggestion sys-
tem whereby safety-related suggestions or recommendations
are elicited from stakeholders (parents, teachers, and staff)
via a variety of sources (e.g., Facebook, email, and tele-
phone). The focus on the safety recommendation/suggestion
system reflects the fact that safety suggestions are the most
tangible and visible aspect of school safety, and represent a
key communication interface between all stakeholders. An
effective safety suggestion system also has the potential to
raise awareness and promote safety. In future research, the
remit of lean thinking is likely to move beyond the school
safety suggestion system to create a framework encompass-
ing all aspects of health and safety at the school.
Figure 3. The three components of lean thinking (mura, muda, and muri) as they relate to the key aspects of managing and promoting
safety at the school.
Srichai et al. 7
The practical application of a lean thinking approach to
managing safety suggestions required a series of steps,
including assessing current safety performance and issues,
mapping the current value stream, identifying improvement
opportunities, and then mapping the future value stream. A
conceptual overview of the methods used at the case study is
illustrated in Figure 4.
Step 1 of the method consisted of knowledge acquisition
from the three key aspects of the school's safety, namely,
finance, people, and operations. Data provided a snapshot of
the school's current safety status to determine areas where
improvement was required, and where lean thinking can
make significant impacts. All financial, operational, and
safety data were collected over the three most recently avail-
able school semesters, including the second semester of 2010
and the first and second semesters of 2011. Following knowl-
edge acquisition, and in line with the principles of lean think-
ing (Womack & Jones, 2003), the next stage of the method
was to specify value, which aimed to identify the value
within each aspect of finance, operations, and people, par-
ticularly in terms of enhancing safety or safety awareness for
the school and students. Once the value had been specified,
the next step involved mapping the current value stream
related to managing and promoting safety in the school.
Value stream mapping is a lean technique to create a holistic
view of the processes and activities involved in managing
and promoting safety at the school. Value stream mapping is
a common aspect of lean thinking and is used as a diagnostic
tool to improve financial and nonfinancial performance
while enhancing resource allocation and satisfaction (Comm
& Mathaisel, 2003; Paciarotti, Ciatteo, & Giacchetta, 2011).
Value stream mapping facilitates a sorting process to distin-
guish between activities and processes that enhance safety at
school, those that do not directly affect safety but are required
and therefore cannot be eliminated, and finally, those that
add zero value to safety at school, and can thus be immedi-
ately eliminated. This sorting leads to the identification of
improvement opportunities before the final step of creating a
future state value stream map, which then acts as a safety
improvement program. The key steps to replicate the method
are first, the collection of appropriate school safety data, sec-
ond, the creation of the current state value stream map, and
then the creation of a future state map. The gap between the
current state value stream map and the future state map iden-
tifies the necessary steps required to create improvements.
When collecting safety data regarding people, teachers
and parents were questioned about their opinion of safety at
the school. It was important to collect teachers' views on
safety, as they have an increasingly important role to play in
assessing and reporting on the school environment (Brand,
Felnerb, Seitsingera, Burnsa, & Bolton, 2008). Teachers and
parents answered the same set of questions to ascertain their
Figure 4. The steps applying a lean approach to managing school safety.
8 SAGE Open
opinions of safety at the school and to identify the type of
hazards or safety issues that most concerned them. In total,
93 teachers and 750 parents responded to the questionnaire.
Data regarding the operational aspects of safety were col-
lected from three sources: the school's accident record
books, an interview with the school's management to iden-
tify the current state of safety, and an identification of any
key issues or hazards reported by parents. Financial data
were collected via an analysis of the school's safety expen-
diture and the subsequent success rate of the implemented
safety suggestions.
The analysis of people, financial, and operational aspects
of school safety facilitated the creation of a current state
value stream map, which was then validated by school's
management, including the director, manager, and senior
teaching staff. Finally, the current state value stream map
was assessed to identify improvement opportunities suitable
for integration into the future state value stream map, which
was then applied at the school.
Results
Current Safety Scenario and Management at the
School
Initial data collection revealed that parents were concerned
about safety at the school. The most commonly described
issues related to the play equipment, tripping hazards, and
building materials in communal outdoor areas. Road safety
during the school pick-up and drop-off times was also
reported as a common issue. Figure 5 illustrates a sample of
the frequently reported hazards at the school.
Despite numerous hazards in the school, parents and
teachers were generally positive when categorizing the
school's safety status. Figure 6 shows results from the ques-
tionnaire given to parents and teachers, which asked the
question, "To what extent do you consider the school to be
safe?"
As shown in Figure 6, the majority of teachers and parents
consider the school safe, with approximately 74% of teach-
ers and 55% of parents judging the school as "safe" or "very
safe." Overall, teachers responded more positively than par-
ents, with few teachers (4%) considering the school "very
unsafe" or "not safe." Approximately, 16% of parents felt the
school was either "very unsafe" or "not safe," and a signifi-
cant proportion (29%) remained neutral, deeming the school
"neither safe nor unsafe."
The survey identifies a discrepancy between teachers'
and parents' perceptions of school safety. Perceptions of
school safety can have significant impacts on the reality of
school safety (Welsh, 2000), and it is therefore important
that parental and teacher perceptions of school safety are
brought into alignment. The lean approach to school safety
in this article encourages this through more effective com-
munication about safety issues and a real improvement in
safety efficiency and effectiveness, which is then reflected
in parental perception.
As expected, teachers were more positive than parents,
feeling ownership and responsibility for the school environ-
ment. This is corroborated by Jimerson and Furlong (2006),
who illustrate that there is a strong relationship between
school safety and the way teachers are perceived. While par-
ents were generally positive, if those parents who answered
"neither safe nor unsafe" are added to those who answered
"very unsafe" or "not safe" nearly half of parents could be
considered as not satisfied with safety at the school. The pro-
posed lean approach would therefore have the dual benefit of
not only enhancing safety in the school but also promoting it
among parents thus increasing their opinion of safety.
Table 2 shows that the average accident rate over three
semesters was 2.3%. The majority of accidents were catego-
rized as relating to physical well-being. While the accident
rate appears relatively low, in keeping with the schools'
desire to develop a proactive rather than reactive approach to
safety and maintain its reputation, the low rate does not rep-
resent a reason to be complacent. Furthermore, a traditional
lean concept is Six Sigma (Kwak & Anbari, 2006) meaning
a target of less than 3.4 defects per million. In this sense, the
accident rate of 2.3% per semester could be reduced, although
the differences between school safety incidents and manu-
facturing defects would preclude the achievement of Six
Sigma in a school safety scenario.
As noted previously, the focus of the research is initially
on applying lean thinking to manage the safety suggestions
being provided to the school. Table 3 shows the various
channels currently used by parents and staff to deliver these
suggestions as well as the number of suggestions and success
rate. Successful suggestions are defined as those, which have
been implemented and remain in place at the school over a
period of 3 months or more. If multiple suggestions were
received for the same incident, these were still counted sepa-
rately, as each suggestion requires management input
whether acted upon or not. Also, one of the aims of the lean
approach is to assist the school in cutting the burden associ-
ated with excessive safety-related communication. The num-
ber of suggestions and average success rate of only 33%
highlights the need to cut waste and improve efficiency.
Figure 7 indicates that as a percentage of the total school
budget, safety currently represents between 3% and 5% of
the budget, averaging 3.2%. In comparison, the U.S. schools
spend approximately 5% of their school budget on safety
(Chase, Coffee-Borden, Anton, Moore, & Valorose, 2008).
The key point regarding school safety expenditure is that it is
relatively low when compared with other budgetary catego-
ries (e.g., teachers and staff) and therefore maximum value
must be extracted from any safety expenditure. Maximizing
value of this budget can be achieved through the application
of lean thinking and by value stream mapping. With this
intention in mind, the current value stream map at the school
is shown in Figure 8.
Srichai et al. 9
Applying Lean Thinking to School Safety
According to the current value stream map shown in Figure 8,
for each safety suggestion or recommendation received, there
are six steps before possible implementation at the school.
There is a processing time of 9 days and 1 hr, but an actual
work time of only 85 min. The process begins with sugges-
tions from parents, teachers, or staff being passed to teachers,
the safety manager, or the school director. The received sug-
gestions must then be reported to the school safety manager,
who in turn reports to the school director. The time taken for a
safety suggestion to reach the school director can be up to 24
hr. Once suggestions have been received, they are discussed at
the weekly school management meeting, which could be up to
7 days from the time the suggestion is received.
Discussion of each suggestion at the weekly meeting is
relatively short, but there is often an overload of suggestions
(see Table 3), and pressure on time. This makes it difficult to

to building work in the school, and (C) tripping hazards and road safety.

distinguish between valuable and nonvaluable suggestions.
Once a decision is made to implement a particular safety
suggestion, the process can be relatively slow, with no dedi-
cated personnel to take responsibility for implementation.
According to the concepts of muda, muri, and mura, the fol-
lowing areas of weakness were discovered, along with cor-
responding opportunities for improvement.
Muda.A lack of standardized reporting procedures means
time is wasted in receiving and reporting safety issues or
suggestions. The lack of effective procedure also results in
administrative delays and associated costs. Multiple commu-
nication channels are also costly and wasteful to manage and
maintain with respect to safety.
Muri. The biggest issue with regard to organizational strain
is an overload of safety suggestions and the corresponding
time and resources required to sort effective from ineffective
suggestions. Strain also exists in communications between
schoolteachers/staff and parents, mainly due to the wasteful
use of time, and lack of procedure mentioned in the category
of muda.
Mura. Key issues with unevenness are the variable treatment
of the reported suggestions, the variance in the decision-
making process when considering whether to pursue a sug-
gestion, and the lack of procedure or personnel to implement
useful suggestions.
The future value stream map, based on the weakness in cur-
rent value stream (Figure 8), and opportunities for improve-
ment are shown in Figure 9.
The expectation is that the 9 days and 1 hr processing time
can be reduced to 4 hr through lean process reengineering.
The new aspects of the safety suggestion system based on the
lean management principles of muda, muri, and mura analy-
sis are as follows:
·
· A new standardized procedure to manage the report-
ing of safety suggestions has been created to stream-
line the reporting process, and cut down the time
taken to pass suggestions to the relevant individuals in
the school. Rather than the school director being the
final step in the reporting chain, a flatter hierarchy has
been created, with multiple individuals receiving
safety suggestions as part of a team. The two key

aspects of muda that have been eliminated are waste
and delays when receiving suggestions, as well as the
elimination of multiple delays during reporting
through the chain of command.
·
· The newly created team that receive safety sugges-
tions are also capable of assessing and making deci-
sions regarding the feasibility of implementation. This
assessment and decision making is based on a prede-
termined set of criteria, as shown in Figure 10.
Increasing the speed of decision making is important
so the school becomes proactive rather than reactive
toward its safety. The creation of the new team and
related decision-making criteria reduces muri (or
organizational strain).
·
· The final aspect relates to reducing the unevenness
(mura) associated with making decision and imple-
menting safety suggestions. The newly created team
and decision criteria constitute one method to reduce
unevenness, while the other is a dedicated member of
staff responsible for the implementation of any safety
suggestions. This reduces the previous uncertainty
and lack of task ownership associated with too many
individuals taking on safety-related tasks.
Figure 10 illustrates a key aspect of lean implementation
at the school, which is a procedure to help standardize and
speed up safety-related decisions. Safety suggestions
received by staff must first be assessed in terms of the value
they provide and in line with the principles of lean. The
value must be visualized before asking whether the sugges-
tion meets a set of safety goals/criteria at the school. If not,
the suggestion is rejected, while if it does meet these goals,
the physical, operational, and financial constraints are con-
sidered using the guiding ideas of muda, muri, and mura.
This allows the safety suggestion to be implemented, modi-
fied to remove any constraints, or rejected. This decision-
making process has been trialed in the school and shows
preliminary success in speeding up decision making. The
process is also consistent in dealing with safety suggestions
and reducing the administrative burden. Parents are also
able to understand that their suggestions/recommendations
are being appropriately, fairly, and consistently addressed
and, more importantly, in a timely fashion. This has
improved safety communication and parental satisfaction at
the school.
The future state value stream map and decision criteria for
the safety suggestions have been implemented in the school
for a period of 3 months. Initial reports based on a school
safety assessment before and after the implementation of the
lean strategy show success. The school director and other
management used a checklist to assess five aspects of school
safety, pre and post lean implementation. The results are
summarized in Table 4, along with a qualitative assessment
of the school's current status in these areas.
Figure 9. The future value stream map and opportunities for improvement.
Srichai et al. 13
The pre and post lean assessment in Table 4 shows signifi-
cant improvement in certain areas of safety, most notably in
information sharing and parent/community involvement.
This is due to the flatter hierarchy, standardized reporting
process, and improved decision making. The assessment
indicates that lean has significant potential for the school to
maximize the value of its safety budget, improve safety pro-
motion, and enhance parental perception of safety at the
school. While the initial focus of the research has been the
safety suggestion system, the school is planning to expand
the application of lean to ensure all aspects of school safety
benefit from the lean approach. Some might argue that the
application of a philosophy originating in the car manufac-
turing industry to a school environment is misguided, or
inappropriate, but the auto industry has been, and remains,
fundamental to the way organizations and individuals oper-
ate in terms of living, working, and thinking (Womack,
Jones, & Roos, 1990). Despite the potential of a lean
approach to school safety, there are a number of significant
management implications.
Management Implications
There are a number of key management implications when
attempting to apply a lean framework to school safety. These
implications arise during the design, testing, and implemen-
tation of the lean framework, and finally, the transformation
of the school to become a lean organization. These

management implications are not confined to Thai schools
and would be similar for any school attempting to implement
a lean approach to safety. Table 5 illustrates these manage-
ment implications, which are discussed according to each
stage of the lean development process.
Design and Testing
When designing and testing a lean approach to school safety,
there are a number of significant management implications.
The process of designing a new approach to safety puts strain
on the school's leadership and adds to an already heavy bur-
den. There is also a degree of uncertainty adding to this
strain. Management are likely to ask questions such as "Will
this work?" or "Will it save money?"
In addition, a period of intensive knowledge capture is
required to gather appropriate data for the development of
the lean approach. For example, in this research, school man-
agement questioned 750 parents and analyzed the resulting
data. This represents significant data capture and analysis for
the school.
Implementation
During the implementation of a lean approach, there are a sig-
nificant number of management implications and barriers.
Perhaps most demanding from a management perspective is
the resistance and anxiety toward change, which is experi-
enced by staff and teachers in the school. Management must
be prepared to justify the program and get staff cooperation to
ensure success and sustainability of the program. Stakeholders
are critical to organizational processes (Henning, Buckle-
Henning, & Hyland, 2012), and therefore management must
ensure commitment from all stakeholders.
The typical issues associated with turning theory into
practice also affect the implementation of a lean safety pro-
gram. For example, while lean thinking is entrenched in
manufacturing, the application of lean to improve school
safety is novel, and has not been widely investigated. The
resulting management implication is that existing theories
and practical tools do not fit the context of school safety
without appropriate modification and adaptation.
Transformation
Once the lean framework is implemented at the school, there
are still significant management implications. These relate to
the continuing transformation of the school and its safety
program after the implementation of lean. There is often a
tendency for staff to return to old habits, and management
must continue to champion the importance of the new lean
program in transforming school safety. This difficulty may
be compounded by the relatively intangible results, or the
long timescales before the benefits of lean become evident.
Training may also be required as it can significantly affect
organizational success (Dermol, 2012). Thus, school leaders
face critical management implications when attempting to
sustain organizational change within the school.
Conclusion and Wider Context
Safe home, safe school, safe community (The Alliance for
Safe Children [TASC], 2006) is often recounted as a mantra
to impart the fundamental importance of child safety in each
of these domains, with children spending significant time at
school during their formative years (Frumkin, Geller, &
Rubin, 2006). As a result, schools have a responsibility to
provide a safe and healthy environment, yet while education
is considered a fundamental human right (United Nations,
2012), in the determination to achieve education for all,
Wisner et al. (2009) argue that children in developing coun-
tries are being put at risk.
School safety means different things to different people
and varies across national and international scales. While
school safety is considered a critical issue, it is mediated and
tempered by geography, culture, and perhaps more impor-
tantly, the budget available to a school. Safe schools are usu-
ally those with an effective leadership along with an
appropriate strategy and vision for a schoolwide approach to
safety. Safe schools should ensure the well-being of their

students by monitoring safety on a regular basis, responding
to parents' concerns, complying with safety policy and regu-
lation, and effectively managing the school budget.
The development of education in Thailand has not kept
pace with economic growth and development (Tsang &
Wheeler, 2012). Therefore, school safety in Thailand has
become a significant issue, which is affected by weak govern-
mental guidance and policy, along with a focus on educational
attainment rather than issues deemed as peripheral. The atti-
tude and approach to school safety vary widely across
Thailand, with private schools often using safety as a differ-
entiating factor. The biggest barriers to promote and achieve
effective school safety relate to management, and involve
cost and bureaucracy, which are two key targets of lean think-
ing. Lean thinking represents a powerful opportunity to
resolve the issues of school safety, and offers the opportunity
to cut waste, bureaucracy, and nonvalue-added tasks to ensure
safety is efficient and not a burden on a school's budget.
Research in this article has used a case study to outline the
current safety scenario and has illustrated some of the key
safety issues at a primary school in northern Thailand. The
application of a lean management approach to maximize the
safety budget, increase parental involvement, and ultimately
lead to a safer school is an effective way to tackle the issue of
school safety in Thailand. Future work will focus on adapt-
ing the lean framework and providing a generalized model of
best practice, which other schools in Thailand can follow to
improve their safety management. The ultimate aim is to pro-
mote safety in Thai schools, tackle the issue of child injury in
Thailand, and do so while operating with limited manage-
ment resources. This is set against a backdrop where child
safety is often viewed as a peripheral and low priority aspect
of education.
Internationally, school safety is a significant area of
research, and goes beyond the issue of safety per se. Schools
throughoutAsia have issues with safety, and according to Han
(2008), these can also have significant impact on academic
achievement. Research in this article suggests that addressing
school safety is not necessarily one of cost, but more impor-
tantly, a question of how to effectively manage school safety.
While the issue of school safety varies internationally, and
even more so at regional and local scales, the effective man-
agement of safety could help reduce this variability. In more
developed countries, school safety is also an issue of consid-
erable debate and most often in relation to juggling an already
stretched budget to address pressing safety issues. The lean
thinking approach has already been demonstrated in a variety
of settings to effectively tackle issues of cost, inefficiency,
and waste, but so far has not extended to educational manage-
ment. The main conjecture from the research in this article
indicates that lean management tools might be an effective
way to address issues of safety not just in Thailand but any
school where cost, bureaucracy, waste, and inefficiencies
plague management processes.
