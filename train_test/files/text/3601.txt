Abstract: The current set of studies examined regret involving action and inaction in the
realm of romantic relationships by testing whether such regret is associated with the
characteristics of one's mate. In study 1, 394 participants reported on a previous casual
sexual encounter, and in study 2, 358 participants reported on a previous romantic
relationship. In both, instances of actual engagement and instances of passing up
opportunities were studied. Study 3 was experimental and elicited reactions to hypothetical
scenarios from 201 participants. Regret reported by men in both study 1 and study 2 varied
as a function of the perceived attractiveness of the participants' actual and potential mate.
Regret reported by women in study 2 varied as a function of the perceived stinginess of the
participant's mate and perceived wealth of the participants' potential mate. Study 3 found
that sex differences in type of regret (with men regretting inaction more than women)
occurred only when the mate presented in the scenario was described in ways consistent
with mate preferences. Together these findings suggest that regret differs between the sexes
in ways consistent with sex differences in mate preferences.

Introduction
"I should have married her when I had the chance." "I shouldn't have eaten that
entire pie." "If only I had not gotten into that car on that fateful day." Sentiments such as
these reflect an emotion that is known to most of us. Regret is an unpleasant emotion

commonly felt when we experience some unfortunate outcome that we believe would have
been different had we taken a different course of action.
There has been a great deal of research on regret, including investigations into what
people most commonly regret, what outcomes generate the most intense regret, and how
peoples' thoughts about regret change over time (Gilovich and Medvec, 1995; Kahneman
and Tversky, 1982; Landman, 1987). In a meta-analysis involving adults of varying ages
and occupations the three most cited regrets in life were education, career, and romance
(Roese and Summerville, 2005). In a sample of college students romance topped the list
(Roese and Summerville, 2005). It is not surprising that romance trumped education and
career among this group as college students are in the midst of pursing education and most
have yet to confront challenges regarding career. Another important distinction in regret
research centers on the difference between action and inaction regrets. Regrets of action
center on what should not have been done, whereas inaction regrets center on what should
have been done, but was not (Gilovich and Medvec, 1995). Which do people regret more?
This question has been the subject of much research, and the answer, not surprisingly,
appears to be that it depends. For instance, Gilovich and Medvec (1995) found time frame
to be an important factor; in the short term action is regretted most, but over time inactions
predominate.
Despite the considerable amount of research on regret, sex differences in regret
have rarely been found. In achievement domains, educational domains, and even most
social domains, men and women do not seem to differ in terms of what causes them regret
(Gilovich and Medvec, 1995). Roese, Pennington, Coleman, Janicki, Li, and Kenrick
(2006), however, found a characteristic sex difference specific to the domain of romantic
relationships. The sex difference centers on the distinction made above between action and
inaction regrets. In three studies, Roese et al. (2006) found that in the context of romantic
relationships, men tend to experience regrets of inaction (failing to pursue romantic
possibilities) over action (engaging in romantic encounters), whereas women report regrets
of inaction and action equally. Importantly, this difference in type of regret was found only
for romantic relationships, and not for familial relationships or friendships. When
examining only the sexual aspects of romantic relationships, a more extreme sex difference
emerged, wherein men reported particularly high levels of regret for inaction and women
reported higher levels of regret for action.
Roese et al. (2006) cite evolutionary factors as a possible explanation for these sex
differences. According to sexual strategy theory, basic differences in the reproductive
biology between men and women have led to the evolution of sex differences in mating
strategies and preferences (Buss and Schmitt, 1993). One important reproductive difference
between men and women is asymmetry in minimum levels of parental investment
(Symons, 1979; Trivers, 1972). Whereas women bear the burden and pleasures of
pregnancy, lactation, and usually childcare, men need only engage in a single act of sex to
produce a child. Secondly, although men who mate with a variety of sexual partners in a
given time span may sire multiple offspring, having multiple partners confers no such
benefit to women (Symons, 1979). Indeed, it is well documented that men have a greater
desire for sexual variety and a greater willingness to engage in casual sex relative to
women (Buss, 2003; Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Clark and Hatfield, 1989; Oliver and Hyde,
Sex differences in regret
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(3). 2012. -424-
1993; Schmitt, 2003). Thus, casual sex is thought to play a larger role in the strategic
repertoire of men than women because it has historically conferred a much greater
advantage to men than to women. In addition, because fertility is more strongly tied to
youth in women than in men (Williams, 1957), a failed relationship may pose a larger
reproductive cost to women than men.
Thus, the sex differences in regret identified by Roese et al. (2006) may be
understood by proposing that such regret results from engaging in behaviors that run
counter to evolved sexual strategies. Men may disproportionately regret neglecting to
pursue romantic opportunities (inaction) because failing to pursue such opportunities has
historically hindered reproductive success. In contrast, among women, for whom there has
historically been greater cost associated with action, it is instances of action that are
disproportionately regretted (at least with respect to purely sexual aspects of relationships).
If it is true that sex differences in relationship regret reflect divergent sexual
strategies, then we might expect sex differences in regret to vary as a function of mate
characteristics in ways that map onto differences in mate preferences. The primary purpose
of the current research is to test this proposition. Although there are some characteristics
that men and women both value heavily in a mate (e.g., kindness), other characteristics are
more heavily valued by members of one sex than the other. Men tend to value
attractiveness and youth in their mates, and women tend to value those with resources and
those willing to provide said resources. That men and women tend to value different
characteristics in their mates has been widely documented (Buss, 1989; Buss and Schmitt,
1993; Shackelford, Schmitt, and Buss, 2005; Tadinac and Hromatko, 2004; Wiederman and
Allgeier, 1992). For instance, one study involving thousands of participants from three
dozen cultures found women more heavily valued resources and status in mates and men
more heavily valued physical attractiveness (Shackelford et al., 2005). According to sexual
strategy theory, these mate preferences stem from sex differences in what constrains
reproductive success (Buss and Schmitt, 1993, but see Eagly and Wood, 1999, for an
opposing view). Specifically, because women invest more heavily in offspring and have
sharp constraints on quantity, the primary reproductive limitation for women centers
around the resources they can secure for themselves and their children. Women therefore
value men with resources and those who demonstrate a willingness to commit those
resources. The primary limitation to men's reproductive success is access to healthy and
fertile females. Since relative youth and physical attractiveness provide strong cues to
health and fertility in females (Fink and Penton-Voak, 2002; Thornhill and Gangestad,
1999), men are hypothesized to value such qualities in potential mates. Thus, we propose
that the pattern of relationship regret identified by Roese et al. (2006) will be moderated by
mate characteristic. Specifically, we propose that men will be particularly regretful of
missed romantic opportunities when the potential mate is attractive and may regret
romantic involvements more when the mate is relatively unattractive. Women, on the other
hand, may be particularly regretful of romantic involvements when the mate is low in
resources (or withholds them) and may regret missed opportunities more when the potential
mate is relatively high in resources and generous with them.
In three studies we tested whether sex differences in relationship regret vary in the
ways proposed above. The first two studies took the form of a survey. In study 1,
Sex differences in regret

participants were asked about either a previous one-night stand or about a situation in
which they believe they had the opportunity to engage in a one-night stand. In study 2,
participants were asked about either a previous romantic relationships or missed
opportunity for a romantic relationship. In both studies participants reported their level of
regret in regard to the target situation and rated their previous partner or potential partner
on a variety of characteristics. In study 3, we presented participants with a hypothetical
scenario that described a person either partaking in or passing up the opportunity for casual
sex or a romantic relationship with someone who varied in terms of physical attractiveness
and resource potential. Participants then rated how regretful they believe they would be had
they been the protagonist in the scenario.
Studies 1 and 2
Materials and Methods
Participants
In both studies, participants were students enrolled in upper division psychology
and biology courses at Southeastern Louisiana University who participated in the study for
extra credit. In study 1 (the casual sex study), 394 students participated. Of these, seven
women and three men reported being either homosexual or bisexual. Data from these
individuals were not included in the data analysis, resulting in a sample of 158 male and
226 female participants. In study 2 (the romantic relationships study) 358 students
participated. Of these, five of the men and seven women reported being either homosexual
or bisexual and were thus not included in the data analysis, resulting in a sample of 144
male and 202 female participants. The mean age of the participants in study 1 was 21.01
years and 21.95 in study 2. In neither sample did male and female participants differ
significantly in age, t(392) = .43, p = .67, for study 1 and t(356) = .95, p = .34, for study 2.
Materials
The questionnaire packet contained either the action survey or the inaction survey
and a demographic questionnaire.
Casual sex survey (Study 1)
Action. In the action survey, participants were asked to think of the most recent
casual sex experience they have had with a member of the opposite sex (an experience in
which the participant had sexual intercourse, i.e., a one-night stand). They were asked to
think of an encounter in which no romantic relationship (i.e., no dating) occurred prior to or
following the experience. If the participant had not had such an encounter in his or her life,
the participant was asked to skip ahead to the last page of the packet. The first question
asked the participant to report how long ago the event had occurred in months. The next
item asked participants to rate how much they regret the encounter on a scale from 1 (not at
all) to 7 (severely). Next, participants were asked to rate the person with whom they had
had the encounter on six characteristics, each on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely).
The characteristics were: funny, kind, stingy, physically attractive, wealthy, and honest.
Sex differences in regret
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(3). 2012. -426-
These traits reflect the primary traits of interest (physically attractive, wealthy, and stingy)
as well as several traits that are generally desired in a mate. Stingy was included because it
is not only the possession of wealth, but the willingness to provide said wealth that is
assumed to be of value to women, and because wealth is not common among students. The
order of the six items was randomly determined for each participant.
Inaction. In the inaction survey, participants were asked to think of the most recent
opportunity where they believe they could have had a casual sexual encounter (could have
had sexual intercourse, i.e., a one-night stand) with a member of the opposite sex, but chose
not to or did not try hard enough to. They were asked to think of an encounter in which no
romantic relationship (i.e., no dating) occurred prior to or following the experience. The
remaining part of the survey was identical to the action survey with the exception that
participants were asked to rate how much they regret not having had the sexual encounter.
Romantic relationship survey (Study 2)
Action. In this survey, participants were asked to think of their most recent former
(i.e., not current) romantic relationship. Romantic relationship was defined for them as a
previously ongoing relationship that could be defined as a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship
(not a strictly sexual one). The remainder of the survey was the same as in study 1 except
that participants were asked to rate how much they regret having been in this relationship
on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (severe) and were asked to report how long ago the
relationship had ended in months.
Inaction. In this survey, participants were asked to think of the most recent situation
in which they believe they could have entered into a romantic relationship with someone,
but they chose not to or did not try hard enough to. They were told to think of a situation
that the respondent believes may have possibly turned into an ongoing relationship that
could be defined as a boyfriend/girlfriend (i.e., not a strictly sexual one). They were then
asked to take a moment to think about this "possibly could have been" relationship and the
other person involved before answering the questions that followed. The remaining part of
the survey was identical to the action survey except that the participants were asked to rate
how much they regret not pursuing this relationship and asked how long ago this
opportunity had occurred.
Demographic questionnaire. The last page asked participants to report their sex,
their sexual orientation, and their age.
Procedure
The experimenter arrived at the beginning of the class and administered the surveys
to the students. Participants received either the action survey or the inaction survey. The
experimenter announced that the purpose of the study was to investigate different types of
relationships, and that participants would receive one of several different versions of a
survey about relationships. The experimenter announced that completion of the survey was
voluntary and stressed the anonymous nature of the questionnaire.

Study 1 Results
Sixty one men (77%) completed the action survey and 64 men (81%) completed the
inaction survey. Sixty nine women (61%) completed the action survey and 89 women
(78%) completed the inaction survey1. Recall that the participants were told to skip the
survey and complete only the demographic form if they had not experienced the situation
described in the survey. Whereas men did not differ in the rate with which they completed
these two surveys, 2(1, N = 158) = .35, p = .56, women were more likely to complete the
inaction survey than the action survey, 2(1, N = 228) = 8.25, p = .01.
Sex differences in regret by type (action vs. inaction) for causal sex encounters
Before analyzing the relationship between mate characteristics and regret, we
examined whether the pattern of sex differences in type of regret identified by Roese et al.
(2006) was evident in the current sample. To do this we conducted a 2 (sex of participant)
X 2 (type of encounter: action vs. inaction) ANOVA with rating of regret as the dependent
variable. There was a main effect of type of encounter, F(1,279) = 60.94, p =.001, such that
regret for action (M = 3.85) exceeded regret for inaction (M = 2.19). Importantly, the
interaction between type of encounter and sex was significant, F(1,279) = 35.16, p = .001.
While men reported relatively similar levels of regret for action and inaction, t(124) = 1.22,
p = .27, (M = 3.16 and M = 2.86, respectively), women reported much higher levels of
regret for action than inaction, t(157) = 11.49, p = .001, (M = 4.55 and M = 1.61,
respectively).
Mate qualities as predictors of regret for casual sex encounters
We used multiple regression analyses to test our predictions about the relationship
between mate characteristics and regret. We conducted a separate regression analysis for
each sex and each type of regret (action vs. inaction). In each of the four analyses, the six
characteristic ratings were entered into the regression model with the rating of regret as the
criterion variable2. These regressions involve the simultaneous entry of all the variables, so
that the coefficients reflect the unique predictive power of each predictor while controlling
for all others.
1 The mean number of months that had reportedly elapsed since the event had occurred was 2.92 for those
who completed the action survey and 2.56 for those who completed the inaction survey. A 2 (type of
encounter; action vs. inaction) X 2 (participant sex) ANOVA on the number of months revealed this (action
vs. inaction) to be a significant difference, F(1,258) = 7.18, p = .01. Neither participant sex F(1,258) = 1.08, p
= .299, nor the interaction between type of encounter and participant sex, was significant F(1,258) = 1.49, p =
.23.
2 Not surprisingly, many of the trait ratings were weakly to moderately correlated. In study 1, correlations
among trait ratings varied in strength from .02 (between fun and kind) to .59 (between kind and honest). In
study 2, correlations among ratings varied in strength from .03 (between stingy and fun) and .52 (between
kind and honest). All predictors in this model and the subsequent models tested in study 1 and study 2
exhibited VIF values less than 2.

Mate characteristics as predictors of action regret in casual sex encounters
Our first regression analysis examined regret in response to having engaged in the
casual sex encounter (action regret). Table 1 reports the coefficients. In this and all
subsequent regression analyses, simple regression models produced findings that did not
differ substantially from the combined models reported below.

The set of six predictors accounted for a significant proportion of variance in men's
action regret, F(6,54) = 5.39, p = .001; R2 = .31. Only the predictor "attractive" was
significant, t(54) = -4.68, p = .001. The six predictors accounted for a significant proportion
of variance in women's action regret, F(6,62) = 4.29, p < .001, R2 = .233. Only the
predictor "honest" contributed significantly to regret among women, t(62) = -2.05, p =
.045.
Mate characteristics as predictors of inaction regret in casual sex encounters
Next, we examined the relationship between mate qualities and degree of regret
over having chosen not to engage in casual sex (inaction regret). Table 1 shows the results
of these analyses. The six predictors accounted for a significant proportion of variance in
men's inaction regret, F(6,57) = 2.55, p = .03; R2 = .13. Once again, the predictor
"attractiveness" was significant, t(57) = 3.42, p = .001. The predictor "kind" was
marginally significant, t(57) = -1.76, p = .084. The six predictors failed to account for a
significant proportion of variance in women's inaction regret, F(6,82) = 1.24, p = .29, R2 =
.02. We note, however, that women reported very low levels of regret for inaction (M =
1.61), which may have precluded any detectable association with the predictors. No
Sex differences in regret

coefficient reached significance, although the coefficient for wealthy was marginally
significant, t(82) = 1.82, p = .073.
Study 2 Results
Sixty four men (89%) completed the relationship survey and 63 men (88%)
completed the missed relationship survey. Ninety (89%) women in our study completed the
relationship survey and 96 (95%) completed the missed relationship survey3. Neither men
[2(1, N = 144) = .07, p = .79], nor women [2(1, N = 202) = 2.44, p = .12] differed in the
rate with which they completed the two surveys.
Sex differences in regret by type (action vs. inaction) for romantic relationships
We conducted a 2 (sex) X 2 (type of experience: action vs. inaction) ANOVA with
rating of regret as the dependent variable to examine sex differences in type of regret. Only
one effect was significant, the interaction between type of experience and participant sex,
F(1,309) = 4.3, p = .034. While women reported relatively similar levels of regret for
inaction and action, t(184) = .628, p = .48 (M = 2.64 and M = 2.80, respectively), men
reported higher levels of regret for inaction than action, t(125) = 2.10 , p = .038 (M = 3.27
and M = 2.58, respectively).
Mate qualities as predictors of regret in romantic relationships
To examine regret over involvement in a previous romantic relationship (action) we
once again used multiple regression analyses with the trait ratings as predictors and action
regret as the criterion variable, performed separately by sex. Table 2 reports the resulting
coefficients. The six predictors accounted for a significant proportion of variance in men's
action regret, F(6,57) = 10.60, p = .001; R2 = .48, with the predictors "attractive" [t(57) =
-3.33, p =.002], "honest" [t(57) = -3.14, p = .003], and "kind" [t(57) = -2.32, p = .024]
being significant. The six predictors accounted for a significant proportion of variance in
women's action regret, F(6,83) = 5.87, p =. 001, R2 = .25, with the predictors "stingy"
[t(83) = 2.18, p = .032] and "kind" [t(83) = - 2.40, p = .019] being significant. In addition,
the coefficient for "wealthy" was marginally significant, t(83) = -1.97, p =.052.
Mate qualities as predictors of inaction regret in romantic relationships
We next examined the relationship between mate qualities and degree of regret over
having not pursued a romantic relationship (inaction regret). Table 2 reports the resulting
coefficients. The six predictors accounted for a significant proportion of variance in men's
inaction regret, F(6,56) = 5.92, p = .001; R2 = .32. The predictors "attractive" [t(56) = 3.30,
3 The mean number of months that had reportedly passed since the event had occurred was 3.33 for those who
had completed the action survey and 4.96 for those who completed the inaction survey. A 2 (type of
encounter) X 2 (participant sex) ANOVA revealed that these two means differed significantly, F(1,296) =
116.23 p = .001. Neither participant sex, F(1,296 )= .01, p = .96, nor the interaction between type of
encounter and participant sex was significant F(1,296) = .11, p = .74.

p = .002] and "honest" [t(56) = 2.08 p = .043] were significant. The six predictors
accounted for a significant proportion of variance in women's inaction regret, F(6,89) =
10.25, p = .001, R2 = .37. The predictors "wealthy" [t(89) = 4.20, p = .001] and "kind"
[t(89) = 3.62, p = .001] were significant.

Discussion
The primary purpose of the study was to test for sex differences in the mate
qualities that predict regret. Consistent with expectations, mate attractiveness accounted for
a significant amount of variance in regret among men for both sexual encounters and
romantic relationships. This held true for both action and inaction regrets. Thus, the more
attractive the woman, the less regret our male participants reported over having engaged
romantically or sexually with her and the more regret they reported over having missed out
on an opportunity to have engaged romantically or sexually. Notably, mate attractiveness
was the only trait that significantly and consistently predicted regret among men in all four
types of romantic/sexual scenarios. In contrast, mate attractiveness did not significantly
predict regret among our female participants for any of the four types of romantic/sexual
scenarios.
The pattern of findings for our female participants was only moderately consistent
with predictions. Our predictions for women largely held up in the romantic relationship
survey. Among our female participants only, mate wealth (in missed relationship
opportunities and, to a marginal extent, in relationships) and mate stinginess (in
relationships) was related to regret. Contrary to expectations, stinginess was not associated
Sex differences in regret
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(3). 2012. -431-
with regret among women in the inaction context. Perhaps stinginess is hard to assess
outside of an actual relationship.
Neither perceived mate wealth nor perceived mate stinginess accounted for a
significant amount of variance in regret involving casual sex among women. Mate
resources are likely less important in very short term mating situations in which continued
investment is generally unlikely. In addition, whereas a mate's physical attractiveness may
be readily and immediately apparent in a casual sex scenario, a mate's wealth or stinginess
is generally not. Lastly, when it came to inaction, women reported little regret, very
possibly resulting in a floor effect.
The only quality that predicted regret in women in the sexual context was honesty
in sexual action encounters, such that women who rated their mates as less honest reported
relatively greater regret over having engaged in casual sex. We believe this may have
resulted from dissatisfaction with the limited nature of the encounter coupled with the
belief that her mate may have deceived her about the nature of the encounter. Researchers
have identified forms of deception that are used to achieve the goals of one sex at the
expense of the other (Haselton, Buss, Oubaid, and Angleitner, 2005). One of the most
robust forms of deception identified in this research is that of men deceiving women about
the depth of their feelings or magnitude of commitment in order to gain sexual access.
Believing that one has fallen prey to such a deception may have been a contributing factor
in women's regret in such situations. Although it is important not to read much out of
marginal findings, we briefly note here that the tendency for men to regret sexual inaction
less when the woman in question was perceived as kind may tie into this as well. There are
certainly many reasons a man may have little regret about passing up an opportunity for a
one-night stand. One reason may be the belief that having a one-night stand may not be in
the best interest of the woman involved. This concern may weigh more heavily when the
woman in question is believed to be kind.
As expected, men and women differed in the type of regret (action vs. inaction) they
experienced with respect to both casual sex and romantic relationships. We discuss these
findings in the general discussion.
Study 3
Overview
Both study 2 and (to some extent) study 1 found that partner characteristics
predicted relationship regret in ways consistent with known mate preferences. It is our view
that the mate qualities influenced the intensity of regret experienced among our
participants. One could argue, however, that the causal direction between partner
characteristics and regret runs in the opposite direction; that regret experienced after a
sexual or romantic encounter distorts or colors one's perceptions of one's partner. The
purpose of our third study was to conceptually replicate the findings of study 1 and 2 by
conducting an experiment. Converging results from different methods would provide
greater confidence in our findings and allow for stronger causal conclusions about the
impact of mate characteristics on regret. In this third study, participants were asked to rate
how regretful they would feel if they were the main character in a hypothetical scenario
Sex differences in regret

that described a person either partaking in or passing up the opportunity for casual sex or a
romantic relationship with someone who varied in terms of physical attractiveness and
resource potential.

course at Southeastern Louisiana University who received partial course credit for
participating. Eleven of our participants (eight female and three male) reported that they
were either homosexual or bisexual and were thus not included in our data analysis. The
mean age of the participants was 20.37 years. Our male and female participants did not
differ significantly in age, t(199) = 1.23, p = .22.
Design
The experiment was a 2 (sex of participant) X 2 (type of relationship; casual sex or
romantic) X 2 (type of situation; action vs. inaction) X 2 (mate characteristic; resource
potential vs. attractive) between subject factorial design.
Materials
Hypothetical scenarios. Sixteen scenarios were created corresponding to the 16
cells resulting from crossing the four factors. The instructions for all scenarios read as
follows: "The following reports a hypothetical situation that may or may not be similar to
something that might happen to you. Please put yourself in the position of the main
character, (described as `you'), as you read the scenario." All scenarios were between 224
and 234 words in length and began by stating that the main character was single. The male
and female versions differed only in terms of the name of the love/sex interest and relevant
pronouns.
The scenarios that presented the casual sexual encounter involved the main
character going to go eat at a local bar and grill with his or her friend. At the bar and grill,
the main character meets a woman/man named Ashley/Mike. "The two of you become
engrossed in conversation, you realize you have quite a bit in common such as that you are
both college students. You have a good time chatting and laughing with one another." As
the establishment begins to close down, Ashley/Mike asks if you would like to finish the
conversation at her/his apartment. The main character agrees. The ending of this scenario
depends upon the action/inaction factor. In the action versions, the scenario ends with:
"once you get to the apartment one thing eventually leads to another and the two of you
have sex. The next morning, you wake up in Ashley/Mike's bed. After a brief conversion
with Ashley/Mike, you leave her/his apartment. You never see Ashley/Mike again." In the
inaction versions, the scenario ends with: "Once at Ashley/Mike's home it becomes
apparent Ashley/Mike would like to have sex. You tell her/him you are not interested and
leave her/his apartment. You never see Ashley/Mike again."
The scenarios that presented the romantic relationship involved the main character
meeting a woman/man named Ashley/Mike in class. "One day in class, a woman/man
Sex differences in regret
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(3). 2012. -433-
strikes up a conversation with you. After talking for a while you realize you have quite a bit
in common with one another and end up talking regularly before class for the remainder of
the semester." Later the scenario reads that "Ashley/Mike seems interested in you. On the
last day of class, Ashley/Mike hands you her/his phone number and asks that you call
her/him if you are interested in going out sometime." It further states that "from previous
conversations, you know s/he is not interested in any sort of casual or purely sexual
relationship." In the action versions, the scenario ends with: "You end up calling her/him
and in time the two of you begin to date one another exclusively. The relationship lasts for
about 9 months. Eventually, however, you two split and go your separate ways, and you
don't see Ashley/Mike again." In the inaction versions, the scenario ends with: "You gladly
take her/his phone number but end up not calling her/him. You never see Ashley/Mike
again."
Partner characteristic was manipulated by describing the love/sex interest as having
high resource potential (and average attractiveness) or as being highly attractive (and
average resource potential). The description appeared midway through the scenario. We
included information indicating that the love/sex interest was average with respect to the
non-target trait in order to preclude participants from inferring a high value on that non-
target trait which would likely result from a halo effect or implicit personality theory. In the
high resource potential conditions, the love/sex interest is described as being "confident
and ambitious. S/he is a business major who has a great job lined up when s/he graduates.
In terms of looks, s/he is rather plain, and is of average attractiveness." In the attractiveness
conditions, the love/sex interest is described as "being good-looking and nicely built. You
consider him/her to be very physically attractive. S/he doesn't seem to have many
ambitions and is not yet sure what s/he wants to do for a living." We believe that this last
sentence, when combined with the information that the love/sex interest is a college
student, describes a person of fairly average resource potential for this population.
The dependent measure of regret. The exact wording of the question used to assess
regret varied slightly by condition. Participants were asked to rate how much he or she
would regret the sexual encounter (or passing on the encounter) described in the scenario or
how much he or she would regret having been in relationship (or not pursuing the
relationship, i.e., not calling Ashley/Mike) described in the scenario. Participants provided
their ratings on a 1 (no regret) to 7 point scale (extreme regret).
Post-scenario survey. The purpose of the post scenario survey was to perform a
manipulation check and to collect demographic information. Participants were asked to
report how Ashley/Mike was described in the scenario. Following this task, participants
were asked to indicate whether they were currently in a romantic relationship, and, if so,
how long they had been in the relationship, their sex, their sexual orientation, and their age.
Procedure
Experimental sessions were run in groups of a maximum of five participants. After
providing brief instructions and emphasizing the anonymous nature of their responses, the
experimenter distributed a scenario and accompanying regret question to each participant
and told the participants to return the sheet to a communal envelope when done. Scenarios
were randomly distributed except that men received a male version and women a female
Sex differences in regret
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(3). 2012. -434-
version. Once everyone placed their completed responses in the envelope, the experimenter
distributed the post-scenario survey. Once everyone had completed the post-scenario
survey, the participants were debriefed, thanked, and excused.
Coding participant descriptions. In order for mate characteristics to have affected
ratings of regret, participants must have both read and registered the few sentences
presented in the scenario that described the partner as either physically attractive or having
high resource potential. In order to identify and analyze data from only participants who
showed evidence of having read and registered the critical information we had a graduate
student, blind to the hypothesis and participant condition, code participants' description of
Ashley/Mike. The description was coded as adequately described if those in the resource
potential condition mentioned either that the person was ambitions or some synonym of
ambitious, had a job lined up, or was a business major or if those in the attractiveness
condition mentioned that the person was attractive or some synonym of attractive.
Results
Ten of the female participants and 11 of the male participants did not adequately
describe the potential mate as depicted in the scenario, and thus were dropped from the
analyses. We then conducted a 2 (sex of participant) X 2 (type of relationship; casual sex or
romantic) X 2 (type of regret; action vs. inaction) X 2 (partner characteristic; resource
potential vs. attractiveness) ANOVA with rating of regret as the dependent variable. There
was only one significant main effect, which was sex of participant, F(1,153) = 5.58, p =
.019. Men reported greater regret (M = 4.12) than did women (M = 3.62). The expected two
way interaction between sex of participant and type of regret was significant, F(1,153) =
43.44, p = .001. This two way interaction shows that while men reported higher levels of
regret for the inaction scenarios than for action scenarios (M = 4.84 and M = 3.41,
respectively), women reported higher levels of regret for the action scenarios than the
inaction scenarios (M = 4.30 and M = 2.95, respectively).
This two way interaction was qualified by two significant three way interactions.
First, and most importantly, it was qualified by partner characteristic. That is, there was a
significant three way interaction between sex of participant, type of regret, and partner
characteristic, F(1,153) = 7.03, p = .009 (See Table 3 for the mean regret ratings of the
corresponding 8 cells and results of follow up simple effects analyses). Although, overall,
men reported higher levels of regret in response to the inaction than action scenarios, this
tendency occurred only when the love/sex interest was described as physically attractive
(and average wealth potential). When men were presented with a love/sex interest who was
described as only average in looks (but high in wealth potential) ratings of regret did not
significantly differ between the action and inaction scenarios. Likewise, although women
overall reported higher levels of regret in response to the action scenarios than the inaction
scenarios, this tendency was significant only when the love/sex interest was described as
merely average in wealth potential (and high in physical attractiveness). When women
were presented with a partner of considerable wealth potential (and average looks) regret
for action no longer significantly exceeded that of inaction. Another way to describe this
interaction is to note that the sex difference in the action/inaction dichotomy occurred only
Sex differences in regret

when the love/sex interest was described as high in attractiveness and average in wealth
potential (i.e., described in ways assumed to be more desirable for men), as the two way
interaction between participant sex and type of regret was significant in this case, F(1,80) =
29.76, p = .001, but was not significant when the love/sex interest was described as high in
wealth potential and average in attractiveness (i.e., when the love/sex interest was
described in ways assumed to be more desirable for women) F(1,81) = 3.01, p = .08. The
crucial 3-way interaction was not qualified by a 4-way interaction with type of relationship,
F(1,153) = .80, p = .37.

A three way interaction between sex of participant, type of regret, and type of
relationship, F(1,153) = 41.66, p = .001, was also significant. Table 4 reports the relevant
mean regret ratings. Simple effect analyses revealed that men reported higher levels of
inaction regret than action regret regardless of whether the scenario depicted a romantic
relationship or a purely sexual encounter. In contrast, women's regret depended upon type
of relationship portrayed, as indicated by a significant 2-way interaction between type of
regret and type of relationship in an ANOVA using female data only, F(1,79) = 129.59, p =
.001. Simple effect analyses revealed that when presented with the casual sex scenario,
women reported much higher levels of regret for action than inaction. When presented with
the romantic relationship scenario, however, women reported higher levels of regret for
inaction than action.
There was one other significant effect, a two way interaction between type of regret
and type of relationship, F(1,153) = 75.60, p <.001, such that participants presented with
the casual sex scenario reported greater regret for action than inaction (M = 4.93 and M =
3.14, respectively), while those presented with a romantic relationship scenario reported
greater regret for inaction than action (M = 4.65 and M = 2.78, respectively).

Discussion
The purpose of the experiment was to lend support to the idea that regret in sexual
and romantic domains is affected by mate characteristics in ways that coincide with mate
preferences. Our results are as predicted. Men reported relatively greater regret in response
to a scenario in which they imagined passing up the opportunity for a sexual or romantic
relationship (compared to imagining having engaged in one), but only when the love/sex
interest was described as attractive (and average in wealth potential). When the love/sex
interest was described as average looking (and high in wealth potential), men no longer
disproportionately reported regret in response to failing to pursue over partaking in the
sexual/romantic relationship.
Overall, women reported greater regret in response to imagining engaging in a
sexual or romantic relationship than in response to imagining passing on the opportunity.
However, again, this tendency depended upon the particular characteristics possessed by
the romantic/sex interest. The pattern held when the love/sex interest was described as
average in wealth potential (and high in attractiveness). When the love/sex interest was
described as high in resources (and average attractiveness), women no longer
disproportionately imagined regretting partaking in the sexual/romantic relationship. This is
exactly the pattern one would expect if attractiveness was more highly valued by men and
wealth potential more highly valued among women.
Curiously, the pattern above did not vary significantly by type of relationship. It
seems reasonable to expect that the relative importance of mate characteristics might differ
somewhat depending on the nature of the relationship. That it did not in this experiment
may in part be due to the relatively short term nature of the romantic relationship we
presented in our study. Perhaps the two characteristics would differentially affect regret if
we had included scenarios that involved a genuinely long term relationship such as
marriage.
One limitation of our experiment involves the manner by which we manipulated
mate characteristic. In our experiment the two target characteristics (wealth and
Sex differences in regret
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(3). 2012. -437-
attractiveness) were pitted against one another. High in terms of one characteristic was
paired with average of the other, and vise versa. One could argue the differences in the
ratings found in the study was driven less by attraction towards the target characteristic and
more by an aversion to the non-target characteristic. We think that unlikely and note that
even if aversion played a role it did so in way consistent with mate preferences. However,
future research should disentangle the two target characteristics in order to provide a
clearer picture of the mechanisms underlying these findings.
General Discussion
The findings reported here are largely consistent with that of previous research
showing that degree of regret experienced by men and women in romantic and sexual
domains differs according to whether the regret was one of action (regret over having
engaged in a relationship or sexual encounter) or inaction (regret over having passed up an
opportunity to engage in a relationship or sexual encounter), with men tending to regret
inaction more than women (Roese et al., 2006).
When asked about a previous romantic experience (study 2), men reported greater
regret over failures to pursue a relationship (inaction) than having had one (action), while
women's ratings for these two (action vs. inaction) were similar. This pattern mirrors the
findings reported by Roese et al. (2006, studies 1 and 2). Men in their study
disproportionally reported inaction regrets while women reported the two types of regrets
with equal frequency. This similarity in findings emerged despite considerable differences
in the way regret was assessed in these the two investigations. Participants in the present
study were asked to think about their most recent romantic relationship or failure to pursue
a romantic relationship. Regret was then measured along a continuum. In contrast, Roese et
al. (2006) asked participants to identify romantic events that caused them regret.
Participants' descriptions were then categorized as action or inaction and their relative
proportions compared. Thus, the similar pattern emerged whether the romantic events in
question involved highly variable levels of regret or were, by definition, regretful.
Sex differences in the action/inaction dichotomy were more pronounced in the
context of casual sexual experiences. Women in our studies reported much higher levels of
regret over having had a one-night stand than over passing one up (either in real-life or in
response to a scenario). In contrast, men reported similar levels of action and inaction
regret (for a real-life one-night stand encounter) or reported greater regret for inaction than
action (in response to a scenario featuring a one-night stand). Men and women reported
similar levels of regret, however, in response scenarios featuring romantic relationships
(study three), with both reporting more regret for inaction than action. Sharper sex
differences in the sexual domain is once again consistent with the findings reported by
Roese et al. (2006, study 3) who found greater sex differences in the sexual compared to
nonsexual components of previous relationships. Theoretically, that sex differences were
stronger in the context of casual sex is not surprising as men and women's sexual strategies
are thought to diverge most in this context (Buss and Schmitt, 1993).
Across our studies, the greatest regret was reported by women in reference to
engaging in casual sex. This is consistent with recent research showing that a substantial
Sex differences in regret
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(3). 2012. -438-
proportion of women (but few men) report an array of negative emotions following a one-
night stand (Campbell, 2008; Eshbaugh and Gute, 2008; Grello, Welsh, and Harper, 2006).
Together these findings may suggest there remain considerable sex differences with respect
to the psychological consequences of casual sex, despite recent advances (e.g., reliable
birth control) having mostly leveled the playing field with respect to the physical
consequences.
The primary purpose of the current research was to examine whether regret in
romantic and sexual domains varies as a function of mate characteristics in ways consistent
with sex differences in mate preferences. The results of our three studies largely, although
not entirely, confirm our hypotheses. In all three studies, men's regret (both action and
inaction) was related to the perceived attractiveness of his mate or potential mate. This held
true for actual relationships and sexual encounters (study 2 and 1 respectively) and was
apparent in our experimental study as well (study 3), where disproportionate regret for
inaction was more pronounced for physically attractive mates.
In contrast to our male participants, females' level of regret in romantic and sexual
relationships was unrelated to mate attractiveness. As expected, mate wealth and stinginess
was related to regret for women, although the relationships were not as strong or consistent
as was the case of mate attractiveness for men. For previous sexual encounters (study 1),
neither of these characteristics was significantly related to regret. These characteristics did,
however, significantly predict regret in former romantic relationships (study 2). The
stingier the mate was rated, the greater the reported regret over having had that romantic
relationship, and the wealthier the potential mate, the more regret the women reported over
having failed to pursue a romantic relationship. The importance of mate resources to
women's regret was also apparent in our experimental study (study 3) where
disproportionate regret for action in response to a scenario was less pronounced for mates
high in resource potential.
Taken together these findings conform quite well to our predictions. It is important
to note, however, that participants in all three studies were, for the most part, young adults.
The sex differences found in these studies may not hold in older and more diverse samples.
For instance, the importance of the mate characteristics wealth and attractiveness may
become less sex differentiated as people get older, and thus the relationship between mate
characteristics and regret may become less sex differentiated as well. Perhaps the largest
limitation of our study is the potential for demand characteristics and social desirability to
have impacted responding. Sexual behavior in particular is a socially sensitive topic, and
collecting data in a classroom setting (as in studies 1 and 2) may have made salient sex-
typed societal expectations. We can't deny the possible influence of such factors. We note,
however, that in studies 1 and 2 our sample consisted only of those individuals who
admitted to the stated sexual or romantic experience. It seems likely the participants most
prone to these biases would have opted out of completing the survey. In addition, we took
several measures to reduce biases in responding (e.g., anonymous responding, a between
subject design, trait ratings collected following regret rating).
Although the mate characteristics of wealth and stinginess were related to regret for
women, the relationships were both fewer and weaker than was the case of mate
attractiveness for men. This is in line with several previous studies indicating that the
Sex differences in regret
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(3). 2012. -439-
importance of mate attractiveness in men's preferences is more consistent across cultures
and seemingly less amendable to societal factors than is women's preferences for men with
resources (Eagly and Wood, 1999; Kasser and Sharma, 1999). Perhaps the importance of
mate resources to women's mate preferences (and perhaps to women's reproductive
fitness) has been overstated. However, it is also likely that the impact of mate resources
may be weaker among female college students than among the general populations. Most
male college students have few resources and current status in regard to resources is not a
good predictor of later status. In addition, mate wealth and stinginess may have yielded
weak associations in comparison to mate attractiveness because such factors may be more
difficult to ascertain and be less salient than physical attractiveness.
The literature on mate preferences has often been criticized on the grounds that its
findings are based on paradigms in which participants list their ideal mate preferences or
examine vignettes and photographs of strangers (e.g., Dickermann, 1989; Eastwick and
Finkel, 2008). Such methods, it has been argued, may not reveal preferences that occur in
real relationships. In the present research, two of the three studies examined ratings derived
from actual interpersonal experiences and found that the level of regret coinciding with
mate preferences were often sex differentiated in the expected manner. In addition,
participants in the current studies were never directly asked about mate preferences, and yet
mate characteristics were implicated in expected ways. By providing some (albeit indirect)
evidence of sex differences in mate preferences in the context of real relationships and
asked in a nontransparent manner, these studies serve to further bolster confidence in the
pattern of sex differences identified in previous research.
We maintain that the sex differences discovered here, like those initially found by
Roese et al. (2006), may be understood by viewing such regret as the result of engaging in
behaviors that run counter to evolved sexual strategies. Men may disproportionately regret
neglecting to pursue romantic opportunities because failing to pursue such opportunities
has historically hindered reproductive success, while women may disproportionately regret
action (at least for purely sexual aspects of relationships) because of the greater costs
associated with action than inaction for women. Likewise, men may regret missing out on
romantic opportunities more (and regret romantic entanglements less) when the mate in
question is attractive because, historically, mating with such women enhanced men's
reproductive success. In contrast, women may regret romantic entanglements less (and
regret passing up romantic opportunities more) when the mate in question has resources
because, historically, mating with such men enhanced reproductive success. Thus, the
regret we feel may not only be a product of our own personal past experiences, but also a
product of humanity's past, reflecting lessons learned and passed down by our ancestors.
The sex differences reported here may also be explained by the differences in
justifications and rationalizations that men and women may have at their disposal in sexual
and romantic domains. Previous research has shown that regret occurs more frequently in
areas that allow for free choice (Roese and Summerville, 2005), and is more keenly felt
when actions are unconstrained by outside forces (Cooper and Fazio, 1984) and are
counter-normative (Zeelenberg, van den Bos, van Dijk, and Pieters, 2002). Men may
experience less sexual regret following action than women because they may feel they have
less choice over such actions than do women ("that's what men do"). This may be
Sex differences in regret
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(3). 2012. -440-
particularly true when the mate is attractive ("how could I say no"). Likewise, women may
regret sexual inaction less than men do because of greater constraints on sexual behavior
(e.g., greater reputational concerns, greater physical risks). These factors may wield some
influence in romantic relationships as well, with women and men being differentially able
to justify partaking and passing up relationships based on the characteristics of the mate or
potential mate.
Whether one favors distal or proximal explanations for these sex differences, the
consequence of such sex differences in regret are the same. Regret, although unpleasant to
experience, serves an important purpose; it pushes people toward corrective action
(Cosmides and Tooby, 2000; Landman, 1993; Plutchik, 1980; Saffrey, Summerville and
Roese, 2008; Zeelenberg, 1999). In the romantic realm, what causes regret depends on
one's sex. The current findings reveal just how tailored such regret may be, functioning to
nudge men and women to seek out and to avoid potential mates in accordance to who is (or
who has been) most reproductively beneficial.
