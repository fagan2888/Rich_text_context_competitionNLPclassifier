Perturbation of lipids and glucose metabolism
associated with previous 2,4-D exposure:
a cross-sectional study of NHANES III data,
1988-1994
Dina M Schreinemachers
Abstract
Background: Results from previous population studies showed that mortality rates from acute myocardial
infarction and type-2 diabetes during the 1980s and 1990s in rural, agricultural counties of Minnesota, Montana,
North and South Dakota, were higher in counties with a higher level of spring wheat farming than in counties
with lower levels of this crop. Spring wheat, one of the major field crops in these four states, was treated for 85%
or more of its acreage with chlorophenoxy herbicides. In the current study NHANES III data were reviewed for
associations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) exposure, one of the most frequently used chlorophenoxy
herbicides, with risk factors that are linked to the pathogenesis of acute myocardial infarction and type-2 diabetes,
such as dyslipidemia and impaired glucose metabolism.
Methods: To investigate the toxicity pattern of chlorophenoxy herbicides, effects of a previous 2,4-D exposure
were assessed by comparing levels of lipids, glucose metabolism, and thyroid stimulating hormone in healthy adult
NHANES III subjects with urinary 2,4-D above and below the level of detection, using linear regression analysis. The
analyses were conducted for all available subjects and for two susceptible subpopulations characterized by high
glycosylated hemoglobin (upper 50th percentile) and low thyroxine (lower 50th percentile).
Results: Presence of urinary 2,4-D was associated with a decrease of HDL levels: 8.6% in the unadjusted data
(p-value = 0.006), 4.8% in the adjusted data (p-value = 0.08), and 9% in the adjusted data for the susceptible
subpopulation with low thyroxine (p-value = 0.02). An effect modification of the inverse triglycerides-HDL relation
was observed in association with 2,4-D. Among subjects with low HDL, urinary 2,4-D was associated with increased
levels of triglycerides, insulin, C-peptide, and thyroid stimulating hormone, especially in the susceptible
subpopulations. In contrast, subjects with high HDL did not experience adverse 2,4-D associated effects.
Conclusions: The results indicate that exposure to 2,4-D was associated with changes in biomarkers that, based on
the published literature, have been linked to risk factors for acute myocardial infarction and type-2 diabetes.
Background
Chlorophenoxy herbicides, such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxy
acetic acid (2,4-D) and 4-methyl-2-chlorophenoxyacetic
acid (MCPA) have been used since World War II for
weed control [1]. Commercial preparations of chloro-
phenoxy herbicides may contain contaminants such as
polychlorinated dibenzo- dioxins and furans [2],
although the most toxic congener, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodi-
benzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD), a contaminant of 2,4,5-
trichlorophenoxy acetic acid, has not been found in
commercial 2,4-D [3]. Chlorophenoxy herbicides are
transported in the environment for both short and long
distances (tens or hundreds of miles) from their point of
application [4,5]. 2,4-D has been found in house dust
[6]. The presence of 2,4-D has been confirmed in
streams and drinking water reservoirs [7,8]. 2,4-D has

mary Drinking Water Regulations [10].
Spring wheat, a major field crop in Minnesota, Mon-
tana, North Dakota, and South Dakota, was treated dur-
ing the 1980s and 1990s for at least 85% of its acreage
with chlorophenoxy herbicides for control of broadleaf
weeds [11]. Several population studies have investigated
the potential association between level of spring wheat
farming and increased rates of adverse effects in these
states. Two studies compared agricultural regions in
Minnesota [12,13]. Other studies were based on the
combined rural, agricultural counties of Minnesota,
Montana, North and South Dakota. Wheat acreage per
county was used as a surrogate exposure measure,
because information on herbicide use by county was
unavailable. The combined population studies showed
that more intense wheat farming per county was asso-
ciated with statistically significant higher rates of birth
malformations, and mortality from cancers, acute myo-
cardial infarction, typy-2 diabetes, and renal disease
[14-16]. The excess adverse health effects observed in
the general population in high-wheat versus low-wheat
counties, and the high use of chlorophenoxy herbicides
applied to spring wheat, suggested that environmental
exposures to these herbicides might be associated with
risk factors for these diseases. It is fairly well accepted
that a higher prevalence of a disease in one geographic
area than in another area may be due to an environ-
mental agent [17].
As an approach toward investigating if environmental
exposures to chlorophenoxy herbicides in high spring-
wheat counties of Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota,
and South Dakota played a role in the excess mortality
from acute myocardial infarction and type-2 diabetes, a
study was conducted involving subjects that had been
tested for presence of urinary 2,4-D, an indicator of a
previous recent exposure. This cross-sectional study was
based on The National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey III, 1988-1994 (NHANES III), one of several
surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) providing national estimates of
the health and nutritional status of the non-institutiona-
lized U.S. population. A subset of the NHANES III sub-
jects, 20-59 years of age, was selected to participate in
the Priority Toxicant Reference Range Study for the
purpose of assessing levels of common pesticides
(including 2,4-D) and volatile organic compounds
(VOC) in blood or urine [18]. No formal statistical sam-
pling procedure was used to recruit the volunteers.
Therefore these volunteers were not representative of
the U.S. population. It is not known if their 1988-1994
2,4-D exposure levels were comparable to the levels of
residents of spring wheat growing counties in
Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota,
who were environmentally exposed to chlorophenoxy
herbicides during the spring season, most likely for sev-
eral consecutive years during the 1980s and 1990s. In
the current study, subjects with urinary 2,4-D level
above and below the level of detection, were compared.
The focus of the investigation was on adverse changes
of lipids and glucose metabolism, which have been
implicated in the pathogenesis of acute myocardial
infarction and type-2 diabetes [19,20]. The starting point
for the analyses was based on the following information:
2,4-D, MCPA and the lipid lowering drug clofibrate (2-
[4-chlorophenoxy]-2-methylpropionic acid ethyl ester)
have similar chemical structures, are lipid lowering in
rats, and are PPARa ligands [21,22]; triglycerides and
high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) are negatively
correlated in humans [23,24].
Methods
Data Source and exclusion criteria
NHANES III survey data are publicly available and do
not contain any identifiable private information. There-
fore any study based on these data is excluded from IRB
approval. The purpose of the current study was to inves-
tigate effects occurring in healthy subjects soon after an
exposure to 2,4-D (half-life of less than one day) as indi-
cated by its presence in the urine. For that reason the
following exclusion criteria were used: those that had a
history of congestive heart failure, heart attack, diabetes,
thyroid disease, lupus, and cancer, were excluded. In
addition, subjects with a white blood cell count >12 ×
109/L, C-reactive protein >10 mg/dl, or glycosylated
hemoglobin (HbA1c) >8%, which could be indications of
inflammatory or metabolic problems, were excluded.
Urinary levels of 2,4-D were determined by the isotope
dilution and tandem mass spectrometry technique [25].
Subjects with urinary 2,4-D levels below the LOD
(1 mg/dl) were given the value 0.7071 mg/dl [20].
Variables and statistical analyses
The analyses included Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, Spear-
man correlations, and linear regression models [26].
Because only 14% of the values of urinary 2,4-D, the
exposure variable of interest, were above the LOD, it
was decided to use urinary 2,4-D as a binary variable,
above versus below the LOD, with values 1 and 0,
respectively. Associations with 2,4-D were investigated
for the following natural log-transformed outcome vari-
ables: HDL, triglycerides, nonHDL, insulin, C-peptide,
plasma glucose, and thyroid stimulating hormone
(TSH). The selection of these variables was based on
their availability and known association with heart fail-
ure and insulin resistance [18,19]. Low density lipopro-
tein cholesterol (LDL) values were missing for 45% of

the subjects. Therefore, the variable nonHDL was cre-
ated by subtracting values of HDL from values of total
cholesterol. This definition of nonHDL includes all cho-
lesterol present in lipoprotein particles considered to be
atherogenic [27,28]. The linear regression models
included the following explanatory variables: 2,4-D (bin-
ary); HDL (continuous, log-transformed, included in all
models except where HDL itself was the dependent vari-
able); urinary creatinine (continuous, log-transformed);
gender (0 = female, 1 = male); age (continuous); BMI
categorized as <25 (referent), 25-29, and  30; ethnicity
categorized as non-Hispanic White (referent), non-His-
panic Black, Mexican American, and "other ethnicity";
smoking categorized as non-smoker (referent), past
smoker, and active smoker. Four additional variables
were checked for their effect on the beta coefficient for
binary 2,4-D using the change-in-estimate method [29]:
alcohol consumption categorized as at least 30 drinks a
month (wine, beer, or liquor) or less than 30 drinks a
month (referent); education categorized as high-school
completed or not completed (referent); household
income categorized as at least $20,000/year or less than
$20,000/year (referent); hours of fasting prior to blood
sample (continuous).
Linear regression analyses were run for all available
subjects. In addition, two subpopulations that were
expected to be more susceptible, were selected: 1) sub-
jects with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) above the
median (5.1%) of the total population, and 2) subjects
with thyroxine (T4) at or below the median (8.5 g/dl)
of the total population. T4 and HbA1c with half-lives of
7 and 120 days respectively, are likely to be indicators of
health status prior to rather than as a consequence of a
recent 2,4-D exposure. High HbA1c and low T4 are
known to be associated with cardiac and metabolic
adverse effects [18]. Subjects with either one of these
conditions may be more vulnerable to potential effects
from chlorophenoxy herbicides. HbA1c and T4 could
have been included in the model for all available sub-
jects as a continuous or categorical variable. However, it
was decided to run the regression analyses separately for
these susceptible subpopulations for ease of interpreta-
tion. Regression results were presented as estimates with
95% confidence intervals (CI). Because no formal statis-
tical sampling procedure was used to recruit the volun-
teers, weighting was not recommended for the analyses
[20].
Results
Among the 1338 available subjects that volunteered for
the NHANES III VOC study, 375 had missing data on
urinary 2,4-D. From the remaining 963 subjects, 236
subjects were excluded based on the exclusion criteria
for this study. Among the resulting 727 healthy subjects,
102 (14%) had 2,4-D levels above the LOD ranging from
1 to 28 mg/dl. Table 1 presents characteristics of these
subjects based on their 2,4-D status. Subjects exposed to
2,4-D had lower HDL (46.9 versus 51.3 mg/dl, p-value =
0.004), and higher urinary creatinine (201 versus
145 mg/dl, p < 0.0001). No other significant differences
among the continuous characteristics were observed.
Figure 1 shows that the effect of urinary 2,4-D on tri-
glycerides is not additive, as illustrated by the intersec-
tion of the two smoothed interpolation lines
representing subjects with urinary 2,4-D below and
above the level of detection. The triglyceride-HDL
Spearman correlation was stronger for the 2,4-D positive
subjects (r = -0.61, p-value < 0.0001) than for the 2,4-D
negative subjects (r = -0.47, p-value < 0.0001). Subjects
with HDL levels of < 40 mg/dl showed increased levels
of triglycerides associated with 2,4-D, while subjects
with HDL  40 mg/dl showed a decrease. This associa-
tion was further explored in a linear regression model
including an interaction term log(HDL)*2,4-D and
adjusting for potential confounders. Similar regression
models were run to evaluate the effect of the log(HDL)
*2,4-D interaction on nonHDL, insulin, C-peptide,
plasma glucose, and TSH.
To determine which one of the additional four predic-
tor variables should be included in the models based on
the change of the 2,4-D coefficient, separate regression
analyses (main effects only) were run for each depen-
dent variable including only subjects with low HDL
(< 40 mg/dl), which was the more 2,4-D-reactive group
(data not shown). It would have been difficult to observe
a change-of-effect in a model including all subjects with
2,4-D present both as a main effect and in the interac-
tion term. The results from these simplified models
showed that education had no effect, but income, alco-
hol consumption and hours of fasting did change the
estimate of 2,4-D by more than 10% for several of the
models. Therefore, all final models included the addi-
tional terms for income, alcohol consumption and hours
of fasting.
The regression model for HDL (main effects only,
Table 2) showed that 2,4-D was associated with a bor-
derline significant 5% decrease of HDL when all avail-
able subjects were included (b-coefficient = -0.048, 95%
CI [-0.101, 0.006], p-value = 0.08), and a significant 9%
decrease for subjects in the lower 50% of T4 (b-coeffi-
cient = -0.09, 95% CI [-0.160, -0.016], p-value = 0.02).
Other factors associated with a decrease in HDL were
being male, active smoking, and BMI  25. Non-Hispa-
nic Black ethnicity and alcohol consumption were asso-
ciated with increased levels of HDL.
Main-effects-only regression models for triglycerides,
nonHDL, insulin, C-peptide, plasma glucose, and TSH
did not show any 2,4-D associated effects (data not

shown). However, inclusion of the log(HDL)*2,4-D
interaction term identified several significant effects. To
facilitate interpretation of this interaction, an equivalent
model was used replacing the log(HDL)*2,4-D interac-
tion term with two separate log(HDL) terms, one for
subjects with 2,4-D < LOD and one for subjects with
2,4-D  LOD. Results from this second model are pre-
sented (Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8), as well as the p-value
for the interaction term.
Results of the regression model for triglycerides
showed that both urinary 2,4-D and HDL played a role
(Table 3). The 2,4-D effect on triglycerides was HDL
dependent, as was also observed in Figure 1. The follow-
ing numeric example illustrates the HDL-associated 2,4-
D effect on triglycerides. Using estimates for all available
subjects, and ignoring all other explanatory variables
(Table 3), it was shown that by solving the equation:
"6.993 - 0.644*log(HDL) = 6.993 + 1.804 - 1.119*log
(HDL)", 2,4-D had no effect on triglyceride levels at
HDL = 48 mg/dl, which agrees with the approximate
point of intersection of the two fitted lines in Figure 1.
Similar calculations showed that at low HDL, e.g.

25 mg/dl, estimated levels for triglycerides were 137 and
180 mg/dl for 2,4-D < and  LOD, respectively. For
high HDL, e.g. 60 mg/dl, estimated levels for triglycer-
ides were 78 and 68 mg/dl for 2,4-D < and  LOD,
respectively. In other words, 2,4-D was associated with
an increase of triglycerides at low HDL, and a decrease
at high HDL. Effects were somewhat stronger for the
susceptible subgroup with HbA1c levels over 5.1% as
indicated by the non-overlapping confidence intervals
for the two log(HDL) terms, and the p-value of 0.005
for the log(HDL)*2,4-D interaction term, in comparison
to the all-available-subjects model with overlapping con-
fidence intervals and the p-value of 0.01 for the interac-
tion term. Other factors associated with increased levels
of triglycerides were age, active smoking, and high BMI.
Being non-Hispanic Black and increased hours of fasting
were associated with decreased levels of triglycerides.
No association between nonHDL and 2,4-D was
observed (Table 4). In the model for all available sub-
jects, male gender, age, high BMI, and income were
associated with increased nonHDL. Non-Hispanic Black
ethnicity and HDL among subjects with urinary 2,4-D <
LOD were associated with a decrease. The effects of 2,4-
D on insulin and C-peptide (Tables 5-6) were most pro-
nounced for the susceptible subpopulation with HbA1c
over 5.1%. Similar to the numerical triglyceride example,
it was shown that among subjects in this susceptible
subpopulation with low HDL (25 mg/dl), 2,4-D was
associated with an increase in insulin, from 9.2 U/ml
for 2,4-D < LOD to 14.0 U/ml for 2,4-D  LOD. At
high HDL (60 mg/dl) 2,4-D was associated with a slight
decrease of insulin, from 6.5 U/ml for 2,4-D < LOD to
5.5 U/ml for 2,4-D  LOD. One subject with a value of
102 U/ml insulin was considered an outlier (the next
highest value was 50 U/ml) and was excluded from the
regression analysis. Other adverse factors associated
with increased insulin for this susceptible subpopulation
were non-Hispanic Black ethnicity and high BMI. Active
smoking was protective. Effects on C-peptide were simi-
lar to those of insulin. At low HDL (25 mg/dl) 2,4-D
was associated with an increase in C-peptide, from 0.50
pmol/ml for 2,4-D < LOD to 0.83 pmol/ml for 2,4-D 
LOD. At high HDL (60 mg/dl) 2,4-D was associated
with a decrease of C-peptide, from 0.34 pmol/ml for
2,4-D < LOD to 0.24 pmol/ml for 2,4-D  LOD. The
two confidence intervals for the log(HDL) terms did not
overlap, which was in line with the highly significant p-
value of 0.006 for the log(HDL)*2,4-D interaction term.
High BMI was an adverse factor for C-peptide. Male
gender was protective for this susceptible subpopulation.
Plasma glucose was not associated with 2,4-D (Table
7). Male gender, age, "other" ethnicity, high BMI, and
hours of fasting were associated with increased plasma
glucose. The association between 2,4-D and TSH (Table
8) was most pronounced for subjects in the susceptible
subpopulation with T4  8.5 g/dl. The level of the
effect depended on HDL, and followed a similar pattern
as for triglycerides, C-peptide, and insulin. Low HDL
(25 mg/dl) was associated with an increase in TSH from
0.77 for 2,4-D < LOD to1.08 mU/L for 2,4-D  LOD.
High HDL (60 mg/dl) was associated with a decrease for
TSH from 1.00 mU/L for 2,4-D < LOD to 0.78 mU/L
for 2,4-D  LOD. The confidence intervals for the two
log(HDL) terms overlapped, in line with the (not highly)
Figure 1 Effect of 2,4-D on the HDL-triglycerides association. The graph displays unadjusted data for combined males and females, age
20-59. The negative association between HDL and triglycerides is displayed for subjects with urinary 2,4-D below the level of detection
(blue circles and line), and above the level of detection (red dots and line).

significant p-value of 0.04 for the interaction term. Age
and BMI were associated with increased levels of TSH,
while non-Hispanic Black ethnicity was protective in the
low T4 model. Among the 727 subjects available for the
analyses, 94 subjects (13.4%) had TSH > 2.5 mU/L, and
T4  4.5 g/dl, which may indicate early or mild thyroid
dysfunction [27]. Four subjects (0.6%) had TSH > 2.5
mU/L, T4 < 4.5 g/dl, which could be defined as having
overt hypothyroidism based on the same definition.
Discussion
The main findings associated with presence of urinary
2,4-D in healthy NHANES III subjects are the overall
5-9% decrease of HDL, and the HDL-dependent effects
on triglycerides, insulin, C-peptide, and TSH, especially
in the more susceptible subpopulations. Inclusion of the
interaction term "log(HDL)*2,4-D" in the regression
model or using an equivalent model with separate terms
for log(HDL) with 2,4-D < LOD and for log(HDL) with
2,4-D  LOD, showed that subjects with low HDL
experienced higher rates of 2,4-D-associated adverse
effects than subjects with high HDL. Without this inter-
action term or its equivalent in the regression model,
the 2.4-D effect would have been completely missed.
Previous exposures to pollutants, which may or may not
have included 2,4-D, may have contributed to the sus-
ceptibility of subjects, by lowering T4 or HDL, or
increasing HbA1c. The effect of increased susceptibility

due to existing conditions such as having high HbA1c
or low T4, was tested in the regression analyses. The
effect of low HDL as an existing condition prior to 2,4-
D exposure could not be tested in this cross-sectional
study. Only a follow-up study can determine if a 2,4-D
exposure is associated with a further decrease of HDL
among low-HDL subjects. The 2.4-D associated adverse
effects of decreased HDL, increased triglycerides, insulin,
C-peptide, and TSH, may be part of a causal path that
eventually may lead to weight gain, acute myocardial
infarction, type-2 diabetes, and possibly other diseases.
This concept is supported by a recent publication dis-
cussing a new model for environmental disease in which
previous cumulative effects of different exposures may
lead to increased vulnerability, thereby creating favorable
conditions for overt disease [30]. It is not clear at this
point why no 2,4-D effect was observed for nonHDL in
the regression analysis. The lack of an association with

plasma glucose may indicate that in this study insulin
and C-peptide are the better biomarkers to observe
changes in glucose metabolism.
The fact that the estimates for other predictors such
as BMI and smoking, are in line with what is known in
the literature, supports the credibility of the methods
used in this study. For example, both smoking and high
BMI are known to be associated with low HDL levels
[31]; moderate alcohol consumption is known to
increase HDL levels [32,33]. In the current study a
decrease of HDL was observed in association with BMI
(in the form of a dose response) and with active smok-
ing, while alcohol consumption (30 or more drinks per
month) was associated with an increase of HDL (Table
2). In general, BMI was associated with each dependent
variable in a dose-response fashion.
The 2,4-D associated adverse effects have been
observed in other studies. 2,4-D is known to interfere

with thyroid hormone transport and to possibly reduce
their levels [34,35]. Thyroid hormones regulate lipid
metabolism by controlling the action of key enzymes in
the reverse cholesterol transport, in which HDL plays a
major role [36-38]. A disturbance of the thyroid hor-
mone homeostasis may impair the reverse cholesterol
transport process, which in turn may result in a
decrease of HDL, a characteristic of subclinical
hypothyroidism [36]. When subclinical hypothyroidism,
representing mild thyroid failure, progresses to severe
hypothyroidism however, normal or increased HDL
levels may be the result [36]. Subclinical hypothyroidism
is a known risk factor for lipid abnormalities, endothelial
dysfunction, and coronary heart disease [27,36,39,40]. A
decrease in HDL plasma levels is associated with an
increase in coronary heart disease [41]. This has been
observed at all levels of LDL and triglycerides, for both
diabetics and nondiabetics, and for both sexes [42-47].

Low HDL is often accompanied by insulin resistance,
obesity, and hypertension, which are risk factors for
atherosclerosis and are components of the metabolic
syndrome [23,43].
The "favorable" triglyceride-lowering effect observed
among subjects with high HDL may be similar to the
known triglyceride-lowering effect in humans treated
with clofibrate or other fibrates with a chlorophenoxy
structure such as fenofibrate (1-methylethyl2-[4-(4-
chlorobenzoyl) phenoxy]-2-methyl-propanoate) [41].
This is supported by an animal study showing that rats
treated with either chlorophenoxy herbicides or clofi-
brate showed a triglyceride lowering effect [22]. 2,4-D,
MCPA, clofibrate, and fenofibrate are synthetic ligands
of the peroxisome proliferator receptors PPARa, which
activate genes involved in lipid metabolism. This activa-
tion results in altered (increased or repressed) transcrip-
tion of genes encoding for proteins that control

lipoprotein metabolism [22,48-51]. PPARs and thyroid
hormone receptors belong to the same superfamily of
nuclear hormone ligand-activated transcription factors
[52]. Adverse effects have been shown in association
with clofibrate [48,53,54]. An animal study showed that
plasma concentrations of T4 and T3 were decreased in
pigs treated for 28 days with clofibrate. This effect, also
noted in rats, was thought to be due to increased hepa-
tic glucuronidation of thyroid hormones [55]. The
similarities of 2,4-D with pharmaceutical fibrates sup-
port the notion that 2,4-D itself may be associated with
adverse effects, although contribution by its contami-
nants can not be ruled out.
Limitations

this study's subjects only, and are not representative of
the U.S. population. In addition, cross-sectional data are

not always able to establish cause-and-effect. If the effect
takes place immediately after the cause, or is based on a
stable system, use of cross-sectional data is appropriate
[56]. However, when the system can be defined as
dynamic, where the cause produces effects over time,
studies using cross-sectional data need to consider
reverse causality [57]. Regarding this study, reverse caus-
ality would ask if presence of urinary 2,4-D could be
considered a consequence of having low HDL. It seems
more likely that the observed changes in biomarkers are
a consequence of exposure to 2,4-D and/or contami-
nants. Another limitation exists when exposures to dif-
ferent pollutants taking place at different times are
associated with the same adverse effect. It is difficult to
separate the contribution by different exposures to the
same adverse effect.
Conclusions
By showing that 2,4-D exposure was associated with
adverse changes in lipid levels, glucose metabolism, and

TSH levels, which may predispose to heart disease and
diabetes, the current study provides support to results
from a previous population study that showed excess
mortality from these diseases in high-wheat counties
[16]. The two types of studies complement each other.
The biomarker study contributed information on the
toxicity pattern of 2,4-D. The population study contrib-
uted information on diseases associated with environ-
mental exposure to chlorophenoxy herbicides. These
combined studies are an example of the recommended
methodology for studies on health effects associated
with environmental exposures [58]. The current study
has highlighted the major role of HDL in response to an
exposure of 2,4-D. Future studies need to confirm these
results, and should further investigate the effect of other
environmental pollutants on HDL and the HDL-asso-
ciated enzyme paraoxonase (PON), a known predictor
of coronary events [42].
