Abstract
Background Obesity has been linked with a chronic state of inflammation which may be involved in the development of
metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and even cancer. The objective of this study was
to examine the association between obesity class and levels of inflammatory biomarkers from men and women who
participated in the 1999­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Methods Serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen were measured among US participants of the
1999­2004 NHANES. We examined biomarker levels across different weight classes with normal weight, overweight, and
obesity classes 1, 2, and 3 were defined as BMI of <25.0, 25.0­29.9, 30.0­34.9, 35.0­39.9, and 40.0, respectively.
Results With CRP levels for normal weight individuals as a reference, CRP levels nearly doubled with each increase in weight
class: +0.11 mg/dl (95% CI, 0.06­0.16) for overweight, +0.21 mg/dl (95% CI, 0.16­0.27) for obesity class 1, +0.43 mg/dl (95%
CI, 0.26­0.61) for obesity class 2, and +0.73 mg/dl (95% CI, 0.55­0.90) for obesity class 3. With normal weight individuals as a
reference, fibrinogen levels increase with increasing weight class and were highest for obesity class 3 individuals, +93.5 mg/dl
(95% CI, 72.9­114.1). Individuals with hypertension or diabetes have higher levels of CRP and fibrinogen levels compared to
individuals without hypertension or diabetes, even when stratified according to BMI.
Conclusions There is a direct association between increasing obesity class and the presence of obesity-related comorbidities
such as diabetes and hypertension with high levels of inflammatory biomarkers.

Introduction
The prevalence of obesity in the United States is reaching
epidemic proportions with one-third of the population being
obese (BMI>30 kg/m2) and two-thirds being overweight.1
Health conditions associated with excess weight include
increased risk for type II diabetes, hypertension, dyslipide-
mia, metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, degenerative
joint disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, and certain can-
cers.2­8 Obesity is also associated with cardiovascular
disease which is the leading cause of mortality in the
United States.9 While the mechanistic relationship between
obesity and the development of obesity-related conditions
are not clearly understood, there is growing evidence to
support the role of inflammation as a possible link.10­13
C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen are biomarkers
representing increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality.14,15 CRP, the most extensively studied inflam-

matory biomarker, is a protein produced by hepatocytes in
the presence of inflammation due to factors such as
infection, injury, or conditions such as obesity.16 Elevated
levels of CRP have been associated with increased
inflammation in the coronary arteries, and thus a marker
for increased risk for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular
disease.17,18 A meta-analysis of seven studies comparing
individuals within the top third with those within the
bottom third at study baseline showed that higher CRP
levels were associated with a risk ratio of 1.7 (95% CI 1.4­
2.1) for coronary heart disease (CHD).19 Additionally,
studies using older NHANES III (1988­1994) data have
shown that levels of CRP are elevated in individuals with
high BMI.20,21 Another inflammatory biomarker that plays
a direct role in coronary artery thrombosis is fibrinogen.22
Fibrinogen, a major coagulation protein and the precursor
to fibrin, is a major determinant of platelet aggregation and
plasma viscosity.23,24 To our knowledge, no studies to date
have examined the relationship between fibrinogen levels
and body weight, but a meta-analysis of 18 studies
examining the association between fibrinogen and CHD
found that individuals with fibrinogen values within the top
third compared to individuals within the bottom third of the
study distribution had a high risk ratio of 1.8 (95% CI 1.6­
2.0) for development of CHD.18 Since the relationship
between obesity and cardiovascular disease, as well as the
relationship between inflammation and cardiovascular
disease, had been established, this study aimed to examine
the association between obesity class and levels of
inflammatory biomarkers (CRP and fibrinogen) utilizing
more recent data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999­2004. We hypothe-
sized that there is a direct relationship between the levels of
inflammatory biomarkers with increasing degree of obesity
and there is an interaction between level of biomarkers and
diabetes and hypertension.
Subjects and Methods
Study Population
The NHANES is conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics which is part of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. The NHANES provides cross-
sectional health and nutrition data for the US population.
The survey examines a nationally representative complex,
multistage probability sample of about 5,000 US civilians
each year, located within 15 counties across the country.
The NHANES survey consists of an extensive health
information interview, a complete physical examination,
and extensive laboratory testing. The physical examinations
were performed in a mobile examination center and all
subjects signed a consent form approved by the Human
Subjects Committee in the US Department of Health and
Human Services.25­27 The three latest, continuous
NHANES dataset were collected between 1999­2000,
2001­2002, and 2003­2004. Prior to 1999, the NHANES
were performed in cluster as NHES I (1960­1962),
NHANES I (1971­1974), NHANES II (1976­1980), and
NHANES III (1988­1994).
Additional information from each participant was collected
during an in-home interview and subsequent medical evalu-
ation at a mobile examination center. During the in-home
interview, information on age (limited to participants
20 years), sex, race/ethnicity, smoking history, alcohol
consumption, history of diabetes mellitus, history of arthritis,
and medication usage was obtained. Participants currently
smoking a cigarette, pipe and/or cigar were classified as
smokers while alcohol consumption was defined as having at
least one drink per week in the past 12 months. The
prevalence of arthritis was self-reported and defined as ever
being told by a doctor or health professional. At the mobile
examination center, blood pressure measurements were taken
by trained interviewers and physicians using standardized
measurement protocols recommended by the American Heart
Association.28 Height, weight, and lipid profile measure-
ments were determined using standard protocols. More
details are provided in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical
Technologists Procedures Manual.29
Participants were considered to have hypertension if
their mean systolic blood pressure, measured at the mobile
examination center, was greater than 140 mmHg or mean
diastolic blood pressure was greater than 90 mmHg, if they
were told by their doctor that they have high blood pressure
or hypertension, or if they were taking antihypertensive
medications. Diabetes mellitus was self-reported and
defined to include subjects who were told by their doctor
they have diabetes and subjects who stated that they were
currently using antidiabetic medication(s) such as insulin or
oral hypoglycemic agents.
Definition of Obesity
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. The
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's definition for
overweight and obesity were used to categorize the degree
of obesity. A BMI <18.5 was categorized as underweight; a
BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 was categorized as normal
weight class; a BMI between 25.0 and 29.9 was categorized
as overweight; a BMI between 30.0 and 34.9 was
categorized as obesity class 1; a BMI between 35.0 and
39.9 was categorized as obesity class 2; and a BMI 40.0
was categorized as obesity class 3. In this study, we did not
differentiate between normal weight and underweight class.

Biomarkers
CRP concentrations were available for participants aged
3 years and older and fibrinogen concentrations were taken
for individuals aged 40 years and older. Using blood samples
collected from participants, CRP concentrations were deter-
mined using latex-enhanced nephelometry. Plasma fibrinogen
levels were quantified using the Clauss clotting method and
were only available for NHANES 1999­2002.30 We analyzed
the levels of CRP and fibrinogen across the classes of obesity.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted in SAS 9.1 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Due to the NHANES'
complex probability sampling of the US population, sample
weights, stratification, and clustering of the sampling design
were incorporated into all SAS survey procedures to ensure
the correct estimation of standard errors, confidence intervals
and p values. A 6-year sample weight was used for CRP
analyses and a 4-year weight was used for the fibrinogen
analysis. Two different sample weights were needed because
CRP measurements were available for 1999­2004 surveys
while fibrinogen was only measured between 1999 and
2002. These specific sample weights were created according
to the National Center for Health Statistics guidelines to
account for oversampling of certain age, sex, race/ethnicity
domains and differential non-response or undercoverage.31
The initial study sample included 29,402 individuals with
only 24,157 participants having CRP measurements. Since
this study was limited to adult age 20 years or older, a total of
10,796 persons were excluded from the CRP analysis,
yielding a total of 13,361 individuals for the final CRP
analyses. Fibrinogen data was only publicly available for a
subset of participants aged 40 years or older in the NHANES
1999­2002 giving a total of 5,690 persons for the analyses of
fibrinogen levels. We limited our study sample to those age
20 years or older because only individuals with complete data
for additional variables adjusted for in our analyses (i.e.,
smoking) were considered.
Unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models were
designed to assess the association between obesity class
(with normal weight [BMI<25.0 kg/m2] as the reference
point) with CRP and fibrinogen levels. Adjusted models
accounted for the possible effects of sex, age, race, smoking
status, alcohol usage, arthritis status, blood pressure, and
triglyceride levels. Analysis of variance was used to
compare mean biomarker concentrations between all
groups. To determine if mean biomarker concentrations
differed between participants with hypertension and diabe-
tes compared to participants without hypertension and
diabetes according to obesity class, a multiplicative
interaction term was created between the BMI variable
and the dichotomous disease variable for inclusion in
additional regression analyses. A similar strategy was
applied to test for differences in biomarker marker levels
by weight class and ethnicity. Unless otherwise noted, data
are presented as mean±standard error (SE) and statistical
significance was set at p values <0.05.
Results
Table 1 lists the demographics of the study population
according to obesity class. The majority of the study
individuals were categorized as normal or overweight;
3,262 of the study participants were categorized as obesity
class 1; 1,335 of the study population were categorized as
obesity class 2; and 827 individuals were categorized as
obesity class 3 (BMI40). Estimates for the presence of
diabetes and hypertension within each of the weight classes
shows that those in the normal weight group had the lowest
prevalence of diabetes at 1.3% and hypertension at 6.8%
while those in obesity class 3 had the highest prevalence for
diabetes at 11.5% and hypertension at 45.2% (Table 1).
Association between CRP Levels and Obesity Class
The association between CRP and obesity class was
initially examined using linear regression without adjust-
ments and results were similar to those from adjusted linear
regression (data not shown). Table 2 presents the change in
CRP levels across weight classes after adjusting the
regression model for age, gender, race/ethnicity, systolic
blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride level,
presence of arthritis, smoking status, and alcohol consump-
tion. There was a positive association between CRP
concentration and each of the BMI levels (p<0.01). The
mean CRP level for the reference group, which consisted of
non-smoking, white males with a BMI <25 kg/m2, was
0.05 mg/dl. With each increase in weight category, the
mean CRP level increased by 0.11±0.03 mg/dl for the
overweight group, 0.21±0.03 mg/dl for obesity class 1
individuals, 0.43±0.09 mg/dl for obesity class 2 individu-
als, and 0.73±0.09 mg/dl for obesity class 3 individuals.
The largest increase in CRP concentration was among
individuals in obesity class 3. A test for trend showed that
the overall increasing change in CRP concentrations was
statistically significant (p=0.04). Analysis on the relation-
ship between BMI and CRP concentration persists when
further stratified by ethnicity (Table 3).
Association between Fibrinogen Levels and Obesity Class
The association between fibrinogen and obesity class was
initially examined using linear regression without adjust-

ments (data not shown), and results were similar to those found
in the model that adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity,
systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride
level, presence of arthritis, smoking status, and alcohol
consumption. An upward trend was observed for mean
fibrinogen levels across weight classes where concentrations
ranged from 287.28 mg/dl for normal weight individuals to
380.78 mg/dl for obesity class 3 individuals (p=0.04). With
normal weight individuals as a reference, the mean fibrinogen
levels for those in the overweight category increased by 11.5±
0.01 mg/dl, 25.6±5.0 mg/dl for obesity class 1 individuals,
40.0±7.6 mg/dl for obesity class 2 individuals, and 93.5±
10.1 mg/dl for obesity class 3 individuals (Table 2). Changes
in fibrinogen levels across all weight classes compared to
fibrinogen levels in the normal weight group were statistically
significant (p<0.01). The greatest increase in mean fibrinogen
level was among the obesity class 3 group where mean
fibrinogen levels increased by 32.5% compared to fibrinogen
levels in the normal weight group. Analysis on the relation-
ship between BMI and fibrinogen levels persists when further
stratified by ethnicity (Table 4).
Association between Inflammatory Biomarkers
with Diabetes and Hypertension
Results from regression analysis confirmed that a synergis-
tic relationship exists between levels of inflammatory
biomarkers with diabetes and hypertension, even when
stratified by BMI. Within each BMI category, additional
subgroups were created based on the presence or absence of
diabetes or hypertension and the mean CRP and fibrinogen
concentrations were determined. Individuals with diabetes
had higher mean CRP and higher mean fibrinogen concen-
trations than individuals without diabetes even when
stratified according to BMI (Tables 5 and 6). Similarly,
individuals with hypertension had higher mean CRP and
higher mean fibrinogen concentrations than individuals
without hypertension even when stratified according to
BMI (Tables 5 and 6).
Discussion
In this cross-sectional analysis of US men and women, the
lowest concentrations of CRP and fibrinogen were found
among normal weight individuals. As BMI ranges in-
creased from overweight to obesity classes 1, 2, and 3, CRP
concentration increased by 0.11±0.03 mg/dl, 0.21±
0.03 mg/dl, 0.43±0.09 mg/dl, and 0.73±0.09 mg/dl,
respectively, and fibrinogen levels increased by 11.5±
3.9 mg/dl, 25.6±5.0 mg/dl, 40.0±7.6 mg/dl and 93.5±
10.1 mg/dl, respectively. The strongest association between
obesity and change in biomarker concentration was
observed among those in obesity class 3.

We observed a strong association between increasing
weight class and increasing CRP concentrations. Compared
to normal weight individuals, there was a 2-fold increase in
mean CRP levels in overweight individuals; a 4-fold
increase in obesity class 1 individuals; and an 8-fold and
14-fold increase among obesity class 2 and obesity class 3
individuals, respectively. Using data from NHANES III
(1988­1994), Ford similarly found that CRP concentrations
increased across six weight categories (BMI<18.5, 18.5 to
<25, 25 to <30, 30 to <35, 35 to <40, and 40 kg/m2). Ford
also found that the odds ratio for elevated CRP levels above
the 85th percentile for BMI of 25 to<30 was 1.51 (95% CI
1.23, 3.86); 3.19 (95% CI 2.60, 3.91) for BMI of 30 to <35;
6.11 (95% CI 4.67, 7.98) for BMI 35 to <40; and 9.30
(95% CI 6.43­13.46) for those with BMI 40 compared to
those with BMI <25 kg/m2.19 Similarly, Visser and
colleagues found that, with increasing BMI, the presence
of elevated CRP levels, defined as CRP0.22 mg/dl,
increases for both overweight and obese (30 kg/m2)
groups. Visser and colleagues also found that overweight
men and overweight women were 1.41 (95% CI 1.09, 1.81)
and 2.23 (95% CI 1.86, 2.67) times more likely to have
elevated CRP levels compared to normal-weight counter-
parts.20
The normal range for fibrinogen is between 200 and
400 mg/dl.32,33 In our adjusted regression analysis between
fibrinogen levels and weight class, being in the overweight,
obesity class 1, obesity class 2, and obesity class 3 groups
placed individuals increasingly near the upper limit of
normal fibrinogen levels. Elevated fibrinogen levels have
been previously shown to associate with insulin resistance
and atherosclerosis.34 We also examined fibrinogen con-
centrations across weight class according to diabetes status.
Our findings suggest that increasing severity of obesity is
associated with increased risk for diabetes. The results also
support the idea that inflammation may play a role in the
development of insulin resistance,35 underlying the impor-
tance of having a normal BMI to prevent the disease onset.
In addition to what has been presented in past studies,
this study quantifies the estimated change in biomarker
concentrations across different weight classes. As antici-
pated, those individuals in the highest weight class, obesity
class 3, had significantly higher CRP and fibrinogen
concentrations relative to the normal BMI group as well
as the other weight groups. This trend did not change with
adjustments for age, gender, arthritis status, race/ethnicity,
or smoking, suggesting that the observed CRP­obesity
relationship is not due to other factors possibly affecting
CRP levels and/or weight status. When we stratified by
diabetes status, we also found that individuals in obesity
class 3 had higher biomarker levels than those in obesity
classes 1 and 2. This was also observed when we compared

CRP levels between diabetics and non-diabetics in obesity
class 3 to those in the overweight and normal weight
categories. Extending our analyses, we also stratified by
hypertension status, reporting the mean biomarker concen-
trations within each weight class for a representative US
population. The general trend supports our primary hy-
pothesis that inflammation severity, indicated by elevated
biomarker levels, directly correlates to weight class.
Inflammation in the presence of obesity is thought to
arise primarily in adipose tissue as a result of chronic
disruption of metabolic homeostasis, which leads to
increased cytokine production and the activation of inflam-
matory signaling pathways in the body.12,13,36 A recent
clinical study by Madsen and colleagues investigated the
effects of short-term and long-term weight loss on levels of
CRP and fibrinogen among obese subjects and found that
long-term weight loss was associated with decreased CRP
and fibrinogen concentrations.37 A systematic review found
that for each 1 kg of weight loss, mean CRP levels were
reduced by 0.13 mg/l.38 Moderate, short-term weight loss,
however, was shown to have no effect on fibrinogen
levels,23 suggesting that long-term weight loss solutions
through lifestyle changes or surgical intervention may be
more useful for reducing inflammation and related disease
risks.
Limitations of this study include the lack of repeated
measurements of biomarker levels as well as the absence of
information regarding any previous medical or surgical
treatment for obesity. Additionally, the extent of our study
on inflammatory biomarkers was limited by the availability
of biomarker measurements in the NHANES dataset; we
did not have the opportunity to access other markers of
inflammation such as interleukin-6 or TNF-alpha. The
population used for our CRP analyses also differed from
the population used for the fibrinogen analysis because
fibrinogen data was only collected among those who were
40 years of age and older between 1999 and 2002 while
CRP measurements were taken among those who were
20 years of age and older between 1999 and 2004. There is
also the possibility for information and recall bias in this
study because data on hypertension, arthritis, and diabetic
status were collected by means of self-report. However, in
this study, possible information and recall biases were
minimized by taking into account additional data collected
on hypertension and diabetes medication usage as well as
any relevant examination or laboratory data. Additionally,
the under- or over-reporting of hypertension and diabetes
should be similar across BMI categories. Despite these
limitations, this study utilizes a large, comprehensive data
set that serves as a representative sample of the US
population, allowing for greater generalizability of the
study results. Multiple markers of inflammation were also
assessed, which increased the possibility of capturing a
more complete description of inflammatory status among
individuals. Future studies are needed to determine if the
changes in inflammatory markers further differ among
obese individuals, and whether inflammatory biomarker
levels decrease at a different rate and by different amounts
in obesity class 1 vs. obesity class 2 or 3. If trends from this
current study are persistent in such future studies, we
anticipate that changes in levels of inflammatory bio-
markers will differ according to weight class. Thus, the
current findings of an association of CRP and fibrinogen
and body weight, if causal, would imply that weight
reduction leads to reduced prevalence of inflammation with
attendant public health benefits.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that levels of inflammatory
biomarkers vary across weight classes, and that this
difference in CRP and fibrinogen concentration is persistent
when patients are subgrouped by ethnicity and by the
presence or absence of diabetes and hypertension. As
shown in our analyses, an increase in severity of obesity
corresponded to higher CRP and fibrinogen levels. Such
elevated biomarker concentrations based on a 6-year period
(1999­2004) suggest that the optimal weight class should
be within normal range of having a BMI less than 25.0 to
possibly reduce the burden of obesity-related comorbidities
in the US.
