The authors compared trends in and levels of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors between the
Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, metropolitan area (Twin Cities) and the entire US population to help explain
the ongoing decline in US CHD mortality rates. The study populations for risk factors were adults aged 25­74 years
enrolled in 2 population-based surveillance studies: the Minnesota Heart Survey (MHS) in 1980­1982, 1985­1987,
1990­1992, 1995­1997, and 2000­2002 and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in
1976­1980, 1988­1994, 1999­2000, and 2001­2002. The authors found a continuous decline in CHD mortality
rates in the Twin Cities and nationally between 1980 and 2000. Similar decreasing rates of change in risk factors
across survey years, parallel to the CHD mortality rate decline, were observed in MHS and in NHANES. Adults in
MHS had generally lower levels of CHD risk factors than NHANES adults, consistent with the CHD mortality rate
difference. Approximately 47% of women and 44% of men in MHS had no elevated CHD risk factors, including
smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, and obesity, versus 36% of women and 34% of men in NHANES. The
better CHD risk factor profile in the Twin Cities may partly explain the lower CHD death rate there.

The national rate of death due to cardiovascular disease
(CVD) in 2005 was 277 per 100,000 population, represent-
ing a 46% decline from 1981 (1, 2). In contrast, Minnesota
had one of the lowest age-adjusted CVD death rates nation-
ally (208/100,000 population) and the greatest percent
change (À35%) among states between 1995 and 2005, rais-
ing the question of whether Minnesota may have better
CVD risk factor levels from preventive management and/
or cardiovascular care than other states (2, 3).
Monitoring the trends in CVD risk factors in popula-
tions enhances our understanding of mortality trends,
since these trends are dynamic and are influenced by the
health environment, personal health behaviors, and med-
ical care. According to a previous report, 44% of the de-
cline in CVD mortality among US adults between 1980
and 2000 was due to changes in CVD risk factors (4).
Specifically, reductions in total cholesterol, blood pres-
sure, smoking, and physical inactivity contributed 24%,
20%, 12%, and 5%, respectively, to the decreased CVD
mortality rate (4). However, the national obesity epidemic
has been associated with increased prevalence of diabetes
and elevations in blood pressure and lipid levels (5, 6).
Changes in eating patterns have also been demonstrated
(7). There is already evidence that the prevalence of hy-
pertension is increasing in adults and children (8, 9). Such
empirical data on population risk factor levels and trends
are required for appropriate public health and medical
policy.

Surveillance provides an integrated assessment of health
and risk trends in populations. The National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), for example,
provides a picture of the nation's health and has been ac-
tively conducted since the 1960s (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
nhanes.htm). Although NHANES assesses many diseases
and health characteristics, the sampling frame and sample
size do not allow detailed analysis of specific geographic
areas, even those with large populations. The Minnesota
Heart Survey (MHS), which has been ongoing since 1980,
provides a more detailed and specific look at CVD risk in
a large population (2.6 million in the 2000 US Census) in-
volving consistent measurement methods over a 20-year
period (10, 11).
In this study, we compared the trends in CVD risk factors
in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area with those in
the United States as a whole using data from the MHS
(1980­1982 through 2000­2002) and NHANES (NHANES
II (1976­1980) through NHANES 2001­2002). Through
this comparison, we aimed to better understand why Min-
nesotans have a lower CVD mortality rate than the US gen-
eral population. We hypothesized that both coronary heart
disease (CHD) mortality and risk status are generally more
favorable in Minnesota than in the United States as a whole
and that Minnesotans have had a somewhat greater rate of
decline in both risk factors and CHD mortality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The MHS, approved by the University of Minnesota In-
stitutional Review Board, has been described previously
(10, 11). Briefly, MHS is a population-based surveillance
study of trends in CVD risk factors. The study population
includes independent probability samples of noninstitution-
alized adults in a defined geographic area: the 7-county
metropolitan area of Minneapolis/St. Paul. Surveys were
conducted in 1980­1982, 1985­1987, 1990­1992, 1995­
1997, and 2000­2002. In each survey, 40 (1980­1992) or
44 (1995­2002) clusters were randomly selected from 704
clusters, and from each cluster, households were randomly
selected to generate a sample size of approximately 5,000
adults. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Participants were asked to complete a home interview and to
undertake a clinic visit. Home interviews comprised ques-
tions about demographic characteristics and health behav-
iors. In the clinic, more detailed information about medical
history, diet, and physical activity was obtained. Anthropo-
metric and blood pressure measurements were taken, and
a nonfasting blood specimen was drawn.
NHANES is a population-based survey of the health and
nutritional status of the noninstitutionalized US population
aged 2 months or older. Information is obtained through
a home interview and clinical examination. Surveys were
originally conducted in 1971­1975, 1976­1980, and 1988­
1994, named NHANES I, II, and III, respectively. Since
1999, the surveys have been conducted on a continuous
basis (1999­2000, 2001­2002, 2003­2004, etc.). In each
census cycle, a multistage, stratified sampling design is used
to select a nationally representative sample of civilian, non-
institutionalized residents of the United States. Details about
the NHANES sampling strategies are available online
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).
Study population
Eligibility criteria for participation in MHS risk factor
surveys included being aged 25­74 years for surveys con-
ducted in 1980­1982 and 1985­1987 and being aged 25­84
years thereafter (10, 11). In 2000­2002, youth aged 8­17
years were included in order to determine the CVD risk
factor distribution among children and adolescents. Re-
sponse rates for participants examined in surveys conducted
in 1980­1982 through 2000­2002 were 69.1% (n ¼ 4,083),
68.1% (n ¼ 5,734), 68.4% (n ¼ 6,304), 64.8% (n ¼ 6,284),
and 64.0% (n ¼ 4,159), respectively (10, 11).
NHANES II (1976­1980) comprised 27,801 persons aged
6 months to 74 years, and NHANES III (1988­1994) com-
prised 39,695 persons aged 2 months or older (12). The con-
tinuous surveys conducted from 1999 onward included fewer
persons. For 1999­2000, a total of 6,401 people aged 20 years
or older were interviewed and examined, while for 2001­
2002, there were 6,911 participants (12). The surveys over-
sampled racial/ethnic minorities to increase the reliability
and precision of estimates of health status indicators for these
subgroups. Overall response rates for adults aged 20­79 years
examined in NHANES II (1976­1980), NHANES III (1988­
1994), NHANES 1999­2000, and NHANES 2001­2002
were 68%, 71%, 71%, and 74%, respectively (12).
For this study, MHS and NHANES data were restricted to
adults aged 25­74 years.
Ascertainment of CHD mortality
Mortality due to CHD (underlying cause of death) was
defined as International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Re-
vision, Clinical Modification (13), codes 410­414 (ischemic
heart disease). Mortality data for the residents of the Minne-
apolis-St. Paul metropolitan area were obtained through link-
age with the Minnesota Death Index, a system that has 98%
agreement with the National Death Index (14). US mortality
data were obtained from the National Death Index. These
data were age-standardized to the 2000 US population.
Measurements
Demographic characteristics, health habits, and medical
history were assessed by means of interviewer-administered
questionnaires in MHS and NHANES. Health insurance in-
formation was also obtained.
In MHS, height was measured with a rigid ruler attached
to a wall and a wooden triangle while the participant stood
in stocking feet on a firm floor. In NHANES, height was
measured using a fixed stadiometer while the participant
stood with his or her heels, buttocks, shoulder blades, and
back of the head against the wall.
In MHS, weight was measured on a balance-beam scale
with participants wearing lightweight clothing and no
shoes. In NHANES II, body weight was measured using a

self-balancing scale, while in later NHANES examinations,
participants were measured on a Toledo digital scale while
wearing only underwear.
Waist circumference was not measured in MHS in 1980­
1982 or 1985­1987 or in NHANES II. In MHS, from 1990­
1992 through the 2000­2002 survey, with the participant
standing in lightweight clothing, waist circumference was
measured at the narrowest part of the torso using an anthro-
pometric tape aligned horizontally with the floor. In
NHANES III, waist circumference was measured at the
junction of the iliac crest and the midaxillary line, whereas
from 1999 onward, it was measured at the natural waist
midpoint between the lowest aspect of the rib cage and
the highest point of the iliac crest.
In MHS, from 1980­1982 through 1995­1997, blood
pressure was measured with a Hawksley random-zero
sphygmomanometer (Hawksley, West Sussex, United King-
dom); during 1995­1997, the Dinamap device (GE Medical
Systems Information Technologies, Inc., Milwaukee, Wis-
consin) was also used in addition to the random-zero device;
and during 2000­2002, only the Dinamap device was used.
The average of 2 measurements taken at rest was calculated
and was calibrated to the mercury sphygmomanometer. In
NHANES, measurements were performed using a mercury
sphygmomanometer according to a standardized procedure.
The result was generated from the average of 3 measure-
ments for each subject (15).
In MHS, nonfasting serum cholesterol level was measured.
From 1980­1982 through 1990­1992, an AutoAnalyzer II
(TechniCon Corporation, Emeryville, California) with a non-
enzymatic method was used and calibrated against the refer-
ence Abell-Kendall method. An enzymatic method was used
in 1995­1997 and 2000­2002. For NHANES II, the
Liebermann-Burchard reaction method was used to analyze
serum samples, and equivalent Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention reference values were adjusted. In NHANES
III, serum cholesterol was measured on a Hitachi 717
Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana) using
commercial reagents (Roche/Boehringer Mannheim
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana) on the basis of an

enzymatic method developed by Allain et al. (16). Both stud-
ies used laboratories that participated in the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention Lipid Standardization Program.
Levels of glucose, triglycerides, and low density lipopro-
tein cholesterol were not assessed in MHS, because blood
was drawn under a nonfasting status.
Statistical analyses
Data were analyzed with SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and SUDAAN, version 10.0 (Re-
search Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina). The multistage sampling strategies were taken
into account for both MHS and NHANES. To account for
the oversampling in NHANES, unequal probabilities of se-
lection, and nonresponse, we used appropriate sample
weights to estimate mean values and standard errors (17).
To combine data from 2 or more 2-year cycles of the con-
tinuous NHANES, we calculated new sample weights.
We created variables representing abdominal obesity (waist
circumference >102 cm for men and >88 cm for women),
hypercholesterolemia (serum cholesterol level !6.2 mmol/L
or !240 mg/dL or current use of cholesterol-lowering
medication), and hypertension (defined as !140 mm Hg
and !90 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure and diastolic
blood pressure, respectively, or current use of antihyperten-
sive medication) according to the definitions of the American
Heart Association and the National Cholesterol Education
Program (18, 19).
The means and frequencies of study variables were calcu-
lated for each survey. Since men and women have clinically
relevant differences in CVD risk factors and CVD-related
chronic disease, all analyses were stratified by gender (20). A
single generalized linear mixed model for each risk factor was
used to estimate level and linear trend across survey years for
MHS with neighborhood cluster as a random effect, and to
estimate level and linear trend for NHANES with strata and
primary sampling unit pairings as random effects and appro-
priate sample weights. Survey year was represented as time
since 1990 (e.g., 1980 was coded À10). The intercept and slope
of the generalized linear mixed model represent the estimated
level in 1990 and the average annual change in each CVD risk
factor, respectively. The MHS and NHANES intercepts and
slopes for each of the risk factors were compared, resulting
in a difference in level (MHS intercept À NHANES intercept ¼
leveldiff
) and a difference in slope (MHS slope À NHANES
slope ¼ slopediff
). We estimated the P value for the difference in
level in 1990 (Plevel, diff
) and the P value for the difference
between slopes (Pslope, diff
). In subgroup analyses, we restricted
the MHS and NHANES samples to Caucasian participants to
control for racial/ethnic differences between samples.
RESULTS
Declining trends in CHD mortality
CHD mortality rates have declined over time in both the
United States generally and the Minneapolis-St. Paul met-
ropolitan area (the MHS area), with a lower rate being seen
in Minnesota. In 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2005, CHD mortal-
ity rates (per 100,000 population), age-standardized to the
2000 US Census for men aged 30­74 years in the Minne-
apolis-St. Paul area and nationally, were 322 vs. 346, 203 vs.
219, 114 vs. 161, and 89 vs. 135, respectively. For women in
Minnesota and nationally, these rates (per 100,000 popula-
tion) for the same years were 102 vs. 120, 69 vs. 82, 37 vs.
63, and 29 vs. 53, respectively. Between 1980 and 2005, the
CHD mortality rates in MHS and NHANES for women fell
71% and 56%, respectively; and for men, the rates fell 72%
and 61%, respectively.
Demographic characteristics of survey participants
The mean age of MHS subjects increased across survey
years, while the ages of NHANES participants were similar
across surveys (Table 1). Fewer racial/ethnic minorities par-
ticipated in MHS than in NHANES; however, participation of
minorities across survey years doubled in MHS and increased
2.5-fold in NHANES. Overall education levels among both
MHS and NHANES participants consistently increased over
time. Although the proportions of men and women graduat-
ing from college significantly increased across all survey
years, more Minnesotans were college graduates in each
survey year than were members of the general population.
Declining trends in CHD risk factors
Trends in adverse CVD risk factors declined over 20
years in both surveys. The declines were similar in the 2
studies for women (Table 2 and Figures 1A and 2A) and
men (Table 3 and Figures 1B and 2B). There were 2 excep-
tions. Systolic blood pressure in men declined faster in
NHANES than in MHS, and obesity increased, although
at a similar rate between the 2 studies (Figure 3). Energy
intake significantly increased across survey years in all
adults, except for men enrolled in MHS; however, total
and saturated fat intake decreased over time.
Lower levels of CHD risk factors in MHS
Since the annual rates of decline were similar for each
risk factor, we compared overall risk factor levels between
the 2 surveys in women and in men. Generally, MHS women
had a better CVD risk factor profile than women in
NHANES (Table 4). Although the men in MHS had a higher
body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2) than those en-
rolled in NHANES, Minnesotans had a smaller waist cir-
cumference, lower blood pressure and total cholesterol, and
lower prevalences of smoking, hypertension, and high cho-
lesterol than men in NHANES (Table 5). Because of a faster
rate of decline, the general difference in systolic blood pres-
sure in men between the studies disappeared by 2000.
We created a risk factor score representing the number of
adverse risk factors for individuals, including current smok-
ing, obesity, hypertension, and high cholesterol. Signifi-
cantly greater proportions of men and women in MHS
than in NHANES had no risk factors (men: 44% vs. 34%;
women: 47% vs. 36%) (Tables 4 and 5). Furthermore,
greater proportions of men and women in NHANES than
in MHS had 2 or more risk factors.

The majority of persons participating in MHS (1995­
1997 and 2000­2002) and NHANES (1999­2002) reported
having some type of health insurance, including private or
government-sponsored insurance. However, more Minneso-
tans were covered (93.1%­96.7%) than members of the US
general population (80.0%­84.8%).
In subgroup analysis, data were examined without the
inclusion of racial/ethnic minority groups. Study results
were similar for analyses of Caucasians only.
DISCUSSION
The ecologic data presented here suggest that both
CHD mortality rates and CHD risk factor levels were
decreasing continuously during the study period in both
Minnesota and the United States as a whole, with Min-
nesota generally being at a lower level. According to
both MHS and NHANES findings, the patterns of most
CVD risk factors have improved over the past 25 years,
with a lower overall CVD risk profile in Minnesotans.
More adults in MHS than in NHANES were free of
adverse CVD risk factors or had only 1 CVD risk factor.
Smoking, known to increase CHD risk at least 2-fold,
was lower among women and men in MHS than in the
general US population, even though these rates have
been on the decline in both populations. As previously
reported by MHS investigators, systolic and diastolic
blood pressure levels and serum total cholesterol con-
centrations have declined over the past 2 decades, de-
spite increasing rates of obesity (10, 11, 21­23).
Notably, the prevalences of hypertension and high cho-
lesterol were lower across survey years among MHS

(both P's < 0.001) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; 1976­2002) (both P's < 0.001). Systolic blood pressure
decreased significantly over time in both surveys. However, rates of blood pressure change for women (panel A) were similar between surveys
(Pdiff
¼ 0.36), while for men (panel B), blood pressure decreased significantly faster in NHANES than in MHS (Pdiff
¼ 0.01). Bars, standard error.

there was no significant difference in the rate of their
declining survey trends.
Declining trends in CHD mortality and CHD risk factors
Interpretation of the relation between CHD mortality rate
trends and the risk factor trends reported in this paper is
limited. First, the Minnesota and national CHD mortality
trends have been continuous, with little change in slope
for many years and with Minnesota rates generally being
lower than national rates. Second, risk factor levels declined
both in Minnesota and nationally, generally at similar rates
(contrary to our hypothesis that risk factors would be de-
clining faster in Minnesota than nationally), again with Min-
nesotans generally having lower risk. Because there was no
clear change of slope in the CHD mortality curve and be-
cause the number of surveys was small, it was not possible
to perform an analysis of lag time between risk factor
change and CHD mortality change. However, the pattern
of decline in mortality and risk factors between Minnesota
and the nation overall is consistent with a role for declining
CHD risk factor levels in determining a decline in CHD
mortality. Investigators who have modeled risk factors and
CVD mortality in prospective studies have attributed the
decline in CHD mortality, in part, to reductions in the mod-
ifiable CVD risk factors (4, 22). For example, investigators
from the British Regional Heart Study concluded that 46%
of the decline in incident myocardial infarction over 25
years among men could be explained by reduced prevalence
of smoking and improved levels of blood pressure, high
density lipoprotein cholesterol, and non-high density lipo-
protein cholesterol (22). Although blood pressure and lipid
levels were not measured in the Nurses' Health Study,

cholesterol levels decreased significantly over time in both surveys, but rates of change were similar between surveys for both genders (Pdiff
¼ 0.58
and Pdiff
¼ 0.56 for women and men, respectively). Bars, standard error.

a decline in incident CHD among women was attributed to
reduced smoking, decreased saturated fat intake, increased
fiber intake, and hormone replacement therapy, even in
women who gained weight (24).
Declining levels of CVD risk factors
Our cross-sectional observation of declining trends in
CVD risk factor levels is generally consistent with pro-
spective studies, which have observed trends of improving
CVD risk factors (2, 22, 24­28), except body weight (29,
30). Normal-weight and obese middle-aged men and
women who maintained their weight over 9 years of
follow-up had improved blood pressure and lipid levels,
and in this study, the change was not due to medication
use (31). However, excessive weight gain over 9 years was
associated with unfavorable changes in CVD risk factors.
In the Framingham Heart Study, from 1970 to 2005, blood
pressure and cholesterol levels improved in adults regard-
less of diabetes status, although many were treated with
medication (32). Unlike other CVD risk factors, the prev-
alences of overweight and obesity (body mass index !25)
and abdominal obesity have been on the rise since the
1980s; the latter is thought to better predict CVD risk
through its relation with insulin resistance and the meta-
bolic syndrome (5, 6, 33­35). Despite the greater preva-
lence of obesity in MHS men than in NHANES men, waist
circumference and abdominal obesity were consistently
lower in MHS than in NHANES across survey years.
Higher educational achievement and better eating patterns
may also explain the better CVD risk profile among Min-
nesotans (25, 36).

(MHS; 1980­2002) (both P's < 0.001) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; 1976­2002) (both P's < 0.001). Body
mass index increased significantly over time in both surveys, but rates of change were similar between surveys for both genders (Pdiff
¼ 0.76 and
Pdiff
¼ 0.83 for women and men, respectively). Bars, standard error.

Despite these generally promising trends, hypertension
and dyslipidemia remain a burden among US adults (37­
40), which may be due in part to disparities in diagnosis,
management, and treatment among race/ethnicity, gender,
and age groups (26, 41­44). In subgroup analysis, however,
findings among Caucasians in MHS and NHANES were
similar to those observed in the primary analysis, which
included minority participants.
Few studies have compared CVD risk factor trends
among regional and national samples. Using data from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral
Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) (45), Greenlund
et al. (46) demonstrated an increased prevalence of multiple
CHD risk factors in the 1990s. Although CHD risk factor
levels declined in our NHANES data, this inconsistency
between studies may be due to the self-report nature of data
collected in the BRFSS, a telephone-based surveillance sys-
tem, as compared with the objectively measured CVD risk
factors in NHANES. The observed increases in multiple
CVD risk factors, however, may actually reflect increases
in awareness of CVD risk factors, although Greenlund et al.
claimed that the BRFSS estimates were comparable to
NHANES estimates for some CVD risk factors (46).
Limitations of the present study include the separate sur-
veillance systems. NHANES and MHS use different mea-
surement methods and sampling strategies, which have been
described elsewhere (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm;
11). For example, the method of measuring blood pressure
changed over time, despite the overlap in study periods and
corrective adjustments (11). Only 1 self-report, 24-hour di-
etary recall was used in each study, which may not represent
usual dietary intake. Thus, misclassification of nutrient in-
take may exist in both studies, but misclassification is likely
to be similar for both. Some differences in MHS and
NHANES participants may be related to age and race/eth-
nicity, though all analyses were adjusted for age and strat-
ified by gender. The results of subgroup analyses were
consistent with those of the primary analyses, suggesting
that differences in race/ethnicity had a minimal effect on
the results.

The strengths of this study include the comparison of 2
large population-based surveys, each using probabilistic
methods to represent a target geographic area, of the secular
trends in CVD risk factors in which much attention was
given to quality control of the measurements. The 2 studies
had similar designs, including the use of population-based
serial cross-sectional surveys. Rarely have studies been con-
ducted to describe and compare the levels of multiple risk
factors across populations over long time periods. In addi-
tion, with inclusion of laboratory and clinic assessments in
both MHS and NHANES, misclassification is probably
smaller than in other surveillance studies, such as the
BRFSS, where participants are asked to report their own
weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol status (45).
These findings of a better CVD risk factor profile are
consistent with Minnesota's lower rates of CHD. Earlier
reports provided evidence of improved cardiac disease prev-
alence through downward trends in hospitalization rates for
CHD, congestive heart failure, and stroke (21, 47, 48). Hos-
pitalization rates are substantially lower in Minnesota than
in the US generally (47). Another potential explanation for
favorable outcomes may be the high quality of health care in
Minnesota (49). Thus, we have demonstrated that Minnesota's
lower rates of CHD may be explained by better CVD risk
factor profiles and, we surmise, greater access to high-quality
health care as well (50).
