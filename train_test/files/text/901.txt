The Effect of Widowhood on Older Adults'
Social Participation: An Evaluation of Activity,
Disengagement, and Continuity Theories

Purpose: This study evaluated how levels of social partic-
ipation change as a result of late-life widowhood. Social
participation is a multidimensional construct incorporat-
ing both formal (e.g., meeting attendance, religious par-
ticipation, and volunteer obligations) and informal (e.g.,
telephone contact and social interactions with friends) social
roles. Design and Methods: Using data from the Chang-
ing Lives of Older Couples study, analyses compared wid-
owed persons to continuously married control participants
to evaluate whether widowhood affects older adults' levels
of social participation. Results: Widowed persons had
higher levels of informal social participation than nonwid-
owed persons, whereas formal social participation levels
were comparable between the two groups. Social partici-
pation levels decrease before the death of a spouse, prima-
rily because of poor spousal health, and increase following
the loss, because of increased support from friends and
relatives. Implications: Maintaining continuity in the realm
of social participation is a strategy older adults use to
cope with spousal loss; however, not all widowed per-
sons have the same resources to alter their levels of social
participation.
Key Words: Social integration, Social support, Formal
and informal social roles, Spousal bereavement
Past research has claimed that widowhood is
among the most stressful of all life events and requires
more psychological and behavioral adjustment than
any other life transition (Barrett & Schneweis, 1980­
1981; D. Gallagher, Thompson, & Peterson, 1982­
1983; Holmes & Rahe, 1967; Thompson, Breckenridge,
Gallagher, & Peterson, 1984). To date, bereavement
studies have focused primarily on the emotional and
psychological responses to widowhood (see Stroebe,
Hansson, Stroebe, & Schut, 2001, for review). In con-
trast, this article explores the social and behavioral
implications of spousal loss. Because older adults
have solidified and internalized a lifetime of habits,
behaviors, and attitudes (Atchley, 1989), the behav-
ioral adjustments associated with late-life bereave-
ment may be one of the most difficult challenges an el-
derly person faces. Upon widowhood, the survivor
must relinquish the status of married person and as-
sume the identity of widow(er). In response to this
identity transition, bereaved persons may realign
their social networks or alter their social activities.
Social interactions outside of the marital relationship
may become increasingly salient, thereby increasing
bereaved persons' level of social involvement. Alter-
natively, social relationships may become strained if
widow(er)s feel like a "fifth wheel" among married
friends, thereby decreasing the bereaved persons'
level of social engagement. Using the Changing Lives
of Older Couples study (CLOC), we explored how
the formal and informal social participation of older
married and widowed persons changes over time and
whether theoretical explanations from social geron-
tology are useful in explaining the patterns of change.
Defining Social Participation
According to Rowe and Kahn (1997), active and
productive engagement in society is a central compo-
nent of successful aging. Applied to bereavement, sus-
tained social engagement could also be a critical com-
ponent of successful adaptation or coping. A positive
relationship between social activity and well-being
is well documented (Lowenthal & Haven, 1968).
Higher levels of social participation are associated

with reduced levels of suicide (Durkheim, 1897/
1951), better physical health and reduced mortality
(House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988), and higher lev-
els of psychological well-being (Beck & Page, 1988).
Literature from the symbolic interaction paradigm
has contended that social participation is instrumen-
tal in creating and sustaining one's self-identity
(Markus & Wurf, 1987; Mead, 1934/1967; Swann,
1987; Swann & Hill, 1982; Thoits, 1983). Given the
theoretical importance of social participation, it is an
important aspect of everyday life to understand. In
this study, we defined social participation as social in-
teraction with persons other than a spouse. The term
social participation as used here loosely describes
what other researchers have termed organizational
affiliations, friendship ties, kinship networks, social
connectedness, social support, or social integration
(Anderson, 1983; Bahr & Harvey, 1980; Bankoff,
1983; Durkheim, 1897/1951; Ferraro, 1984; Thoits,
1983; Vachon et al., 1982). Our measure of social
participation is a multidimensional construct incor-
porating both formal (e.g., meeting attendance, reli-
gious participation, and volunteer obligations) and
informal (e.g., telephone contact and social interac-
tions with friends) social roles.
The Effect of Widowhood on Social Participation
The bereavement literature has generally agreed
that widowed persons who have higher levels of social
support also have higher levels of well-being and life
satisfaction (Anderson, 1983; Bahr & Harvey, 1980;
Bankoff, 1983; Ferraro, 1984; Hershberger & Walsh,
1990; Lowenthal & Haven, 1968; Vachon et al., 1982).
These findings suggest that the more active one is
after widowhood, the easier the adjustment process
may be. Widowed persons often have increased con-
tact with friends and family during the initial funeral
and mourning period (Lopata, 1996). However, it is
unknown whether widowhood creates only a tempo-
rary or a more enduring change in widowed persons'
social participation (Ferraro, 1984; Hollstein, 1998).
The current study explores older adults' level of social
participation 6 months after the loss of their spouses.
It compares widowed persons with continuously mar-
ried control participants to see if changes in social
participation among older adults are due specifically
to the event of widowhood or generally to the effect
of age or the passage of time.
Theoretical Explanations: Activity, Disengagement,
and Continuity Theories
For purposes of this analysis, we have adapted
three prominent theories from social gerontology to
proffer specific hypotheses regarding the effect of late-
life widowhood on social participation. First, activity
theory (Cavan, Burgess, Havinghurst, & Goldham-
mer, 1949) claims that as one experiences disability
and other age-related declines, social roles may be-
come unattainable. As a way to preserve their self-
identity in the face of these deficits, aging adults will
replace lost social roles with new, compensatory activ-
ities. Thus, activity theory offers the following hypoth-
esis: Although both widowed persons and controls will
increase their social participation over time in re-
sponse to age-related deficits and losses, widowed
persons will exhibit higher levels of social participa-
tion compared with nonwidowed persons because of
simultaneously losing the multiple social roles that
were tied to the marriage or the spouse.
Second, disengagement theory (Cumming & Henry,
1961) posits that aging adults will withdraw from soci-
ety and vice versa. The mutual process of disengagement
makes room for younger generations and prevents un-
necessary disruptions in the social system caused by
deaths among the older population. In the context of
this analysis, disengagement theory offers the following
hypothesis: Although both widowed persons and con-
trols will slowly disengage from social activities as they
age, widowed persons will exhibit lower levels of social
participation when compared with similarly aged mar-
ried persons because the experience of losing a spouse
serves as a striking reminder of one's own mortality and
how disruptive death can be for survivors.
Third, continuity theory (Atchley, 1989) rests on
the assumption that individuals seek to maintain role
stability throughout the life course. Although the ag-
ing process may present an individual with changing
normative expectations or possible disruptions in the
availability of social roles, older adults will attempt to
preserve continuity of attitudes, dispositions, prefer-
ences, and behaviors throughout their life course.
Thus, prior behaviors and attitudes are often the sin-
gle most significant predictors of present or future be-
haviors. In terms of widowhood, the most successful
widow(er) would be the individual who is most effec-
tive in maintaining the lifestyle he or she developed
earlier in life. The specific hypothesis generated from
continuity theory suggests that widows and nonwid-
ows will not necessarily differ in terms of social par-
ticipation; rather, prior levels of social participation
will determine current levels of social participation.
Gerontologists have debated the explanatory power
of these theories since their inception (see Bengston &
Schaie, 1999, for review). Critics of continuity theory
suggest that continuity of lifestyle and role stability is
nearly impossible considering the inevitability of role
loss through events such as retirement, death of loved
ones, and the emptying of the familial nest (Matras,
1990). Disengagement and activity theories are criti-
cized for being far too simplistic in their explanations--
can one variable really explain why older adults adapt
to the aging process in the way they do (Quadagno &
Street, 1996)? Despite the considerable criticisms that
these theories have garnered, the hypotheses stated
above offer a theoretical springboard for the proposed
analyses while offering a unique opportunity to empir-
ically evaluate the utility of these theories.
Prior Research and its Methodological Limitations
Given the criticisms related to the three theories, it
should not be surprising that the empirical evidence is
524 The Gerontologist
also inconclusive. Chambre (1984) found support for
continuity theory, showing that people maintain sim-
ilar activities as they age. Arens (1982­1983) and van
den Hoonard (1998) found support for disengage-
ment theory, suggesting that widows and widowers
spend less time participating in recreational activities
than before. S. K. Gallagher and Gerstel (1993) found
support for activity theory, showing that widowed
women spend significantly more time with a larger
number of friends compared with married women. In
a small-sample analysis of widows and widowers,
Hollstein (1998) identified three typical patterns of
change in social networks, with each pattern roughly
equivalent to one of the three theories. Ward, Logan,
and Spitze (1992) also found that patterns of social
involvement vary by marital status, suggesting that
married couples may not need additional forms of
social support, whereas widow(er)s may seek addi-
tional social support to compensate for the loss of
spousal intimacy. Given these disparate findings, the role
of marital status and the effect of marital transitions in
determining older adults' activity levels are unclear.
We believe the empirical literature is inconclusive
for four reasons. First, findings across studies may not
be comparable because analyses are based on very dif-
ferent types of social participation. Widowhood may
affect involvement with particular types of activities
and not others. Second, bereavement studies are often
based on female-only samples, making it impossible to
assess whether adjustment patterns vary by gender.
Given the wives' predilection to maintain social net-
works and kinship ties for the marital couple (Gold-
scheider, 1990; Hagestad, 1986; Waite, 1995; Waite &
Gallagher, 2000), men and women may exhibit mark-
edly different behavioral and emotional outcomes in
response to widowhood (Miller & Wortman, in press;
Umberson, Wortman, & Kessler, 1992). Third, most
research has relied on retrospective accounts of one's
social involvement before widowhood. Retrospective
accounts reflect the survivors' reinterpretation of
their previous life, thus biasing the true levels of activ-
ity before the loss. Fourth, empirical analyses related
to widowhood and social support rarely use a control
group from which to differentiate the effects of wid-
owhood from the effects of advancing age or the pas-
sage of time. Given that widowed samples are often
older, sicker, and more emotionally distraught than
nonwidowed samples, past studies may have attrib-
uted reduced levels of social participation among
widowed persons to spousal bereavement rather than
to selection traits. Without a control group and with-
out consideration of the true levels of baseline social
participation, the effects attributed to widowhood
may have been overstated in past studies.
Data from the CLOC study make it possible to
overcome each of the above limitations and thus pro-
vide a more complete answer to how social participa-
tion is affected by late-life widowhood. First, the
CLOC data include two separate multi-item measures
of social engagement (formal and informal social par-
ticipation) to explore whether the effect of widowhood
differs by type of activity. Second, the CLOC sample is
stratified by gender. Third, the CLOC study contains
an age-matched control group, which distinguishes
between widowhood and age effects. Fourth, the
quality and breadth of baseline (prewidowhood) data
eliminates potential selection bias found in widow-
hood research. In sum, this article explores how older
adults alter their everyday social participation follow-
ing widowhood and compares these results to the pre-
dictions derived from activity, continuity, and disen-
gagement theories.
Methods
Sample
Analyses are based on the CLOC study. CLOC is a
prospective study of widowhood that used a two-
stage area probability sampling technique to collect
information from married individuals in Detroit,
Michigan. Eligibility was restricted to noninstitution-
alized English-speaking married couples in which the
husband was at least 65 years old. Of those sampled,
1,532 individuals completed a baseline interview,
yielding a 68% response rate.
Following the baseline interview (1987­1988), the
vital status of the respondent's spouse was monitored
with monthly death records from the state of Michi-
gan. The National Death Index was used to verify all
spouses' deaths. Those respondents who lost spouses
during the study period were reinterviewed 6, 18,
and 48 months after the deaths. Controls from the
original sample, individually matched on age, race,
and sex, were also reinterviewed at comparable
times. Because the Wave 1 interview occurred 6
months after the death of the spouse, not 6 months
after the initial baseline interview, there are signifi-
cant variations in interview timing depending on
when spouses died in relation to the baseline inter-
view. Baseline assessments were more temporally dis-
tant for those who lost their spouses at later dates. To
address the differences in interview timing, all analy-
ses controlled for the duration (in months) between
the baseline interview and the Wave 1 interview. This
control variable was not significant in any of the
analyses, nor was it significant when interacting with
widowhood status.
Analyses were based on a sample of 297 older
adults (217 women and 80 men) who participated in
both the baseline and Wave 1 interviews. The ana-
lytic sample included 210 widowed persons and 87
nonwidowed controls. Women were oversampled in
order to maximize the number of bereaved respon-
dents during the 5-year study period. Controls were
available for only some of the bereaved spouses be-
cause funding for the control sample was cut from
the proposed budget and not reinstated until halfway
through the data collection period for Wave 1. A final
centered weight, adjusting for unequal probabilities
of selection and nonresponse, was applied to all data
before analyses were performed. The unweighted
sample size was 333, with 249 widowed persons and
84 controls.

Measures
Dependent Variables.--Two statistically and con-
ceptually distinct dimensions of social participation
were considered. Informal social participation ( 
.52) is an index consisting of the following: (a) How
often do you get together with friends, neighbors, or
relatives and do things like go out together or visit in
each other's homes? and (b) in a typical week, about
how many times do you talk on the telephone with
friends, neighbors, or relatives? Formal social partic-
ipation (  .71) included the following three items:
(a) How many hours did you spend doing volunteer
work during the last 6 months? (b) how often do you
attend meetings or programs of groups, clubs, or or-
ganizations that you belong to? and (c) how often do
you attend religious services? Each item was mea-
sured with a five-category response ranging from at
least once a day to less than once a month. The scales
were standardized, with higher values indicating
higher levels of social participation. Although un-
standardized scales produced similar findings, we
chose to use the standardized dependent variables for
ease of interpretation and comparability.
Predictor Variables.--Widowhood identified those
persons who became widowed between the baseline
and Wave 1 interviews. Baseline formal and informal
social participation were identical to the two scales
described above, except they were based on baseline
responses rather than Wave 1 responses.
Control Variables.--Both the social participation
and the widowhood literature have asserted that de-
mographic characteristics are important determinants
of late-life adjustment (Arens, 1982­1983; Hersh-
berger & Walsh, 1990; House, 1987; Lopata, 1996).
Therefore, all analyses controlled for sex (a dichoto-
mous variable indicating female), age (measured con-
tinuously in years at the time of the baseline inter-
view), education (a continuous measure ranging from
3 to 17 completed years of schooling), total house-
hold income at baseline (natural log of income), home
ownership at baseline (a dichotomous variable where
1  owns home), and race (a dichotomous variable
indicating White).
Confounding Variables.--Analyses also included
several variables thought to expose potentially spuri-
ous relationships between widowhood and social par-
ticipation levels. Variables considered in the analyses
include individual- and couple-level health dynamics,
individual personality characteristics that may make
one more resilient or "protected" in times of stress
(Caspi, 1987; Rodin, 1987), and structural barriers
or constraints that may affect one's ability to engage
in social activity. Widowed persons may significantly
differ from nonwidowed persons on these variables;
therefore, the inclusion of these confounding vari-
ables in the analyses is imperative to distinguish the
effects of widowhood from those associated with age-
related declines. Other couple-level characteristics such
as the quality of the marital relationship or the nature
of the death itself are important predictors of grief
(Carr et al., 2000; Carr, House, Wortman, Nesse, &
Kessler, 2001), but such variables did not account for
the variation in social participation following the loss
and thus were not included in the analyses. Presum-
ably, the baseline measures of social participation suf-
ficiently captured the relevant qualities of the mar-
riage and the nature of the death. With the exception
of depression, all the following variables were mea-
sured at baseline.
To assess the role of individual- and couple-level
health characteristics, analyses included three mea-
sures of respondent's health and two measures of
spouse's health. Activity limitation (  .77) was a
standardized scale measuring the respondent's func-
tional health and disability, with higher values indi-
cating higher levels of activity of daily living impair-
ment. Self-rated health was a dichotomous variable
indicating poor or fair baseline health. The respon-
dent's depression (  .81) was assessed with a subset
of 9 negative items from the 20-item Center for Epi-
demiological Studies­Depression scale (Radloff, 1977),
with higher values indicating higher levels of depres-
sion at Wave 1. Although the three measures of indi-
vidual health were significantly correlated (activity
limitation and self-rated health  .37; activity limita-
tion and depression  .13; self-rated health and de-
pression  .16; p  .05), each tapped into a distinct
aspect of health that may influence one's social partic-
ipation levels. Activity limitation described physical
impediment to activity performance, depression was
associated with reduced energy levels and activity in-
volvement, and self-rated health was a global mea-
sure of overall health assessment. Two additional
health measures were included to assess the dynamic
role of couple-level health characteristics. Spouse
health indicated those respondents who reported
their spouse's baseline health as poor or fair. Provided
care for spouse was a dichotomy indicating those re-
spondents who provided in-home care for a spouse.
Spouses who provided at least 1 hr of care per week
were identified as the baseline caregivers.
One personality measure was included in the anal-
ysis. Extraversion (  .53) was a standardized scale
representing how emotionally connected, socially ac-
tive, and outgoing the respondent was. Higher values
indicate higher levels of extraversion. Other personal-
ity characteristics such as self-esteem, openness, agree-
ableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability
were initially included, but were later excluded be-
cause they were insignificant predictors of social
participation.
Finally, three variables represent possible constraints
to activity performance. Employed was a dichotomous
variable indicating persons who worked for pay at
baseline. Employment may enhance social participa-
tion by expanding one's social network or limit it
by representing a competing use of free time. Drive
automobile was a dichotomous variable indicating
those persons who drove an automobile at baseline.
Older adults who are able to drive themselves may be
526 The Gerontologist
more socially engaged as they have the means for self-
determined transportation. No children identified re-
spondents who had no living children. Children may
encourage their elderly parents to remain actively en-
gaged in social activities.
Analytic Plan
The analyses used a variety of descriptive tech-
niques to describe the patterns of social participation
following the loss of a spouse. Some analyses com-
pared widows with controls in order to differentiate
the effects of widowhood from aging, whereas addi-
tional analyses compared subgroups within the wid-
owed sample to assess the differential responses to
widowhood. Using ordinary least squares (OLS) re-
gression techniques, we compared widowed persons
with controls to estimate formal and informal social
participation levels 6 months postwidowhood. Esti-
mated regression coefficients for widowhood and
baseline social participation were evaluated in a test
of the three competing hypotheses. If the effect of
widowhood was positive, support for the activity the-
ory would be achieved; if the effect of widowhood
was negative, support for the disengagement theory
would be achieved; and if the effect of baseline social
participation was positive, support for the continuity
theory would be achieved.
Results
Sample Characteristics
Table 1 demonstrates that the widowed and non-
widowed samples were remarkably similar in terms
of major demographic characteristics. The average re-
spondent was approximately 70 years old with nearly
a high school education and an annual household in-
come in the low $20,000s. Most owned their homes
and had at least one child. More than two thirds
drove automobiles, and few (15%) were employed.
Although respondents did experience moderate activ-
ity limitation levels, only a quarter to a third of re-
spondents reported their health as being fair or poor.
A few notable, but expected, differences existed be-
tween the two samples. Widowed persons had signif-
icantly higher levels of depression compared with the
controls (p  .001). Widowed persons were more
likely than controls to have provided care for their
spouses at baseline (p  .001) and to report their
spouses' baseline health as poor or fair (p  .001).
Figure 1 graphically illustrates the mean levels of
social participation at baseline and Wave 1 for both
the widowed and nonwidowed samples. Compared
with the still-married persons, the informal social
participation of widow(er)s was significantly lower at
baseline (.01 compared with .23, p  .05) and rela-
tively similar at Wave 1 (.03 compared with .11,

p  .10). On the other hand, formal social participa-
tion did not differ by marital status. Using a repeated
measures t test, we found that controls exhibited a
significant decline in both informal (p  .001) and
formal social participation (p  .05), whereas the so-
cial participation of widowed persons remained rela-
tively constant over time. These descriptive results
suggest that the social participation of widowed per-
sons significantly differs from that of their married
counterparts. These results also question whether
widowed persons alter their social participation in cu-
rious ways before the actual death of their spouses.
To explore whether adjustment to widowhood be-
gins before the date of death, Table 2 presents OLS re-
gression coefficients predicting baseline (preloss) levels
of social participation. As suggested in the descriptive
analyses, those persons who later became widowed
had significantly lower levels of baseline informal par-
ticipation than the continuously married (informal

.29, p  .01). Spousal health was also an important
predictor of reduced social engagement (informal

.31, p  .001). This analysis suggests that adjust-
ments do occur before the actual loss and reinforces
the importance of considering characteristics of both
the husband and the wife when assessing the daily ac-
tivities of older adults.
The Effect of Widowhood on Social Participation
The multivariate analysis presented in Table 3 fur-
ther explores how the social participation levels of
older adults change over time and in response to wid-
owhood. Model 1 showed the effect of widowhood
controlling for demographic characteristics; Model 2
added in potentially mediating variables including the
health status of both the husband and the wife, indi-
vidual personality characteristics, and other struc-
tural constraints; and Model 3 controlled for baseline
social participation levels.
As shown in Model 1 and replicated in Models 2­
3, widowhood significantly predicted informal social
participation levels, but not formal social participa-
tion levels. Model 3 showed that widowed persons
had informal social participation scores 0.44 stan-
dard deviation units higher than nonwidowed per-
sons, whereas widowed persons did not differ from
controls in their level of formal social participation.
Although not shown here, we ran identical models
predicting social participation 18 months postwidow-
hood. The resulting coefficients were similar to those
presented in Table 3, suggesting that changes in social
participation occurred within the first 6 months after
widowhood and continued to persist across longer
time horizons. In sum, widowhood yielded a sus-
tained increase in informal activity levels, but no
change in formal social participation levels.
Model 2 considered the effects of individual- and
couple-level characteristics that may predispose one
to certain levels of social engagement. As expected,
extraverted persons participated more in social activ-
ities (formal
 .09, p  .05; informal
 .11, p  .05),
whereas depressed persons participated less in infor-
mal social activities (informal
 .09; p  .05). Driv-
ing an automobile and not having children were also
important predictors of increased activity. Surpris-
ingly, neither individual health nor spouse's health
predicted level of social participation at Wave 1.
However, as previously noted in Table 2, spousal
health characteristics were influential in determining
baseline levels of social participation.
Model 3 considered baseline social participation as
a possible predictor of future social participation.
Baseline social participation was highly influential in
determining subsequent social participation, reveal-
ing that persons with high social participation at
baseline continued to have relatively high social par-
ticipation at Wave 1 (formal
 .58, p  .001; informal

.31, p  .001). The addition of baseline social partic-
ipation in Model 3 significantly improved the fit of
the models, as evidenced by the increasing of the
adjusted R2 from .13 to .46 for formal social partici-
pation and from .16 to .29 for informal social partic-
ipation. Despite the potentially disruptive effect of
widowhood, continuity prevailed as widowed per-
sons adjusted to the loss of their marriage partners

and the accompanying social opportunities tied to the
marriage.
Finally, we assessed all analyses in Table 3 to deter-
mine whether adjustment to widowhood differed by
sex. The Widowhood  Sex interaction term was not
significant in any model, suggesting that the effect of
widowhood on social participation was similar for
widows and widowers. The analyses also considered
whether the effects of the predictor variables differed
by whether one becomes widowed or remains contin-
uously married. Identified with a superscript a in Ta-
ble 3, widowhood interacted with income, education,
and race, signifying that African American widowed
persons and those with lower socioeconomic status
have significantly lower levels of social participation
than nonwidowed persons or widowed persons of
higher socioeconomic status. Widowed persons with
no children also exhibited particularly low levels of so-
cial participation following widowhood.
Given the above analyses, it is unclear if the in-
creases in social participation among widowed per-
sons were due to the bereaved seeking out additional
activity or to the inclination of friends and relatives to
offer care and support to recently widowed persons.
Additional analyses using only the widowed sample
shed light on whether the increased social participa-
tion was a result of passive reaction or active re-
sponse. A majority of widowed persons (71%) had
the same amount of interest in having contact with
relatives and friends as when their spouses were alive;
however, more than a third (35%) reported that
friends and relatives showed more interest in having
contact with them when they became widowed. Very
few widowed persons expressed less interest in social
participation following widowhood, either on their
part (12%) or on the part of friends and relatives
(6%). The results presented in Figure 2 suggest that
the predicted increase in informal social participation
noted in Table 3 is perhaps attributable to being
sought out by concerned friends and relatives rather
than to seeking out additional forms of social activity
to fill the void left by the spouse's death. Sex differ-
ences are not apparent in this analysis, meaning that
men and women received increased support from
friends and relatives equally. Although for men the
death of their wives often represents the loss of their
social coordinator, widows and widowers were likely
to exhibit similar behavioral outcomes because much
of the change in social participation is attributable to
receiving additional support rather than to coordinat-
ing additional social activities.
Although continuity prevails in their behavioral
adjustments, most widowed persons considered in-
creased social activity an effective way to combat the
psychological distress associated with the loss. Figure
3 shows that a majority of widowed persons (87%)
said that they "tried to keep busy or tried to get in-
volved in some activity as a way to cope with the neg-
ative effects of widowhood." When comparing the
demographic characteristics of these two groups,
those respondents who reported increasing their ac-
tivity tended to be younger and have higher incomes,
and were more likely to own their home, be White,
and drive an automobile. If increased social participa-
tion is beneficial to the successful adaptation to wid-
owhood, older widow(er)s who are not as economi-
cally well off are perhaps structurally disadvantaged
in their ability to successfully cope with the poten-
tially devastating losses associated with widowhood.
Discussion
Summary and Conclusions
This research explored how the social participation
of older married and widowed persons changes over
time and whether theoretical explanations from so-
cial gerontology are useful in explaining the patterns
of change. We found that social participation consists
of two distinct subtypes--formal and informal--that

persons)?
530 The Gerontologist
respond differently to widowhood. Widowed persons,
both men and women, exhibited a sustained increase in
informal social participation following spousal loss,
whereas formal social participation levels did not fluc-
tuate over time or in response to widowhood. A ma-
jority of widowed persons admitted to using in-
creased social participation as an active coping
strategy to deal with the negative effects of widow-
hood. These behavioral patterns suggest that social
participation, particularly informal activities such as
telephone contact and getting together with friends, is
an aspect of daily life that is deeply affected by late-
life bereavement. Formal social participation may not
provide the emotional and instrumental support that
informal social participation does, thus explaining
why formal social participation levels remain con-
stant after widowhood.
Four broad themes, which encompass broader is-
sues related to late-life bereavement, characterize the
major findings of these analyses. The first theme holds
that a desire for continuity dominates the adjustment
process following widowhood. Widowed persons over-
whelmingly expressed a desire for continuity when
asked about how much contact they preferred to have
with others compared with how much contact they
had before the loss. Analyses demonstrated that prior
social participation is, by far, the best predictor of
subsequent social participation. Despite the disrup-
tion caused by widowhood, survivors displayed tre-
mendous resiliency when adjusting their levels of
social activity and community involvement. In both
preferences and actual behaviors, older adults dem-
onstrated a sense of continuity when faced with the
unfortunate experience of becoming widowed.
The second theme contends that widowhood is a
process rather than a discrete event or static state.
Much of the past research has characterized widow-
hood as a discrete event defined by the spouse's date
of death or as a marital status defined as being wid-
owed rather than married, single, or divorced. Past re-
search has largely been based on cross-sectional or
retrospective data, whereas the current analyses used
prospective, longitudinal data from a widow­control
sample. Our findings, using the methodologically
unique CLOC study, insinuate that widowhood is a
process of adjustment that begins before the actual
date of death and extends well beyond the initial
mourning period associated with spousal bereave-
ment. Future widow(er)s and those with ill spouses
may have a sense-of-death forewarning and devote
their time and energy to their spouses in their final
days or months, thus reducing their preloss levels of
social engagement. Following the actual death, wid-
owed persons continue their process of adjustment,
generally exhibiting a sustained increase in extrafa-
milial social activities. The use of prospective, longi-
tudinal data is imperative to evaluate the processual
nature of widowhood.
A third theme concerns the interrelatedness of so-
cial actors. Although only the survivor assumes the
widowed label, the effects of widowhood are not ex-
perienced in isolation. We found that the increased
social participation among the widowed sample was
perhaps a function of others rallying around the be-
reaved, rather than of the survivor's seeking out addi-
tional social activity. Consistent with past research,
older adults receive an outpouring of support from
friends and relatives during times of perceived need
(Hogan & Eggebeen, 1995). Lopata (1996) argued
that social involvement increases after widowhood
because friends, relatives, and neighbors uncondition-
ally offer emotional and instrumental support to the
recently bereaved. As childless widow(er)s exhibit
particularly low levels of social integration, kin may
be particularly crucial to the adjustment process by
encouraging elderly parents to remain socially en-
gaged. Increased social participation, whether pas-
sively or actively acquired, is a reflection of how mul-
tiple actors experience and influence the transition to
widowhood.
A fourth and final theme assumes that there are
multiple pathways to individual bereavement out-
Figure 3. Do older adults alter their social participation following the loss of a spouse (n  210 widowed persons)? T tests were used
to assess significant differences between means; *p  .05.
531

comes. Our findings imply that the patterns of behav-
ioral adjustment following widowhood depend on
the psychological, familial, and socioeconomic re-
sources of the survivor. Some widowed persons--
whether due to race, class, or some other constraint
such as the availability of transportation or the pres-
ence of children--exhibit significantly lower levels of
social participation than widowed persons with more
favorable characteristics. The traditional theories of
aging, as well as the general bereavement literature,
implicitly assume that all persons have equal resources
as they age. Our findings question the universality or
widespread availability of the economic, intellectual,
and interpersonal resources needed to successfully ad-
just to old age generally or the event of widowhood
specifically. Because the pathway to widowhood and
its ensuing grief may be structurally determined
and diversified by the particular resources available to
the survivor, bereavement research must consider
both the material and the interpersonal resources
available to widow(er)s in order to understand the ad-
justment process.
Evaluation of Activity, Disengagement,
and Continuity Theories
In addition to providing an empirical analysis of
the behavioral adjustments related to late-life widow-
hood, we also explored the utility of three theories
from social gerontology to explain why older adults
adjust their social participation levels. Despite its crit-
icism as an explanatory model, continuity theory pre-
vails as the most applicable theory (among the three
theories considered) for the longitudinal study of
social participation among older adults. Both married
and widowed persons are likely to exhibit levels of
social participation in the future similar to those they
displayed earlier in the life course. Additional results,
using the widowed-only sample, indicated that older
adults preferred to maintain similar pre- and postloss
levels of contact with relatives and friends. These
findings offer convincing support for the existence of
and desire for continuity, throughout the life course
as well as in the face of widowhood. However, our
analyses, which are limited to persons older than 65,
cannot capture whether individuals may have selec-
tively narrowed their social networks before age 65
(Carstensen, 1992). Developmental research has sug-
gested that social networks are highly adaptive
throughout the life course, with preferences for cer-
tain social partners beginning as early as age 3 (Ma-
coby, 1990) or as early as adolescence (Dunphy, 1963).
If this is the case, have widowed persons really main-
tained continuity throughout the life course or have
they merely exhibited stability between the two waves
of data collection?
Given our finding that widowed persons have in-
creased levels of informal social participation, do the
analyses offer empirical support for the activity hy-
pothesis? Activity theory implies that the person ex-
periencing the losses will actively replace the lost
social roles with compensatory social roles, rather
than passively acquire increased social support as
suggested by our analyses. Thus, although the direc-
tion of change is reminiscent of activity theory, we ar-
gue that our findings offer little empirical support for
activity theory. Nor do the empirical results offer con-
vincing support for the disengagement hypothesis, as
widowed persons do not exhibit significant declines
in social participation following the deaths of their
spouses, as hypothesized. Nevertheless, soon-to-be
widowed persons or persons with sick spouses do
have reduced levels of social participation, suggesting
that older adults may experience a social withdrawal in
times of spousal illness or impending spousal death.
Although this exercise in theory testing is largely
inconclusive, it is not altogether futile. None of the
theories, as hypothesized in the context of widow-
hood, are wholly supported nor wholly refuted. This
limited and tempered support provides further testa-
ment to the inability of the classical theories of social
gerontology to adequately explain the empirical real-
ities of aging (Bengston, Rice, & Johnson, 1999). A
developmental or lifespan perspective may prove use-
ful in assessing late-life changes (Antonucci, 1989;
Baltes, Reese, & Lipsitt, 1980). For example, Laura
Carstensen's (1987, 1991, 1992) theory of socioemo-
tional selectivity and Toni Antonucci and her colleagues'
(Antonucci, 1990; Antonucci & Jackson, 1987; Kahn
& Antonnuci, 1980) social convoy model seem to be
more appropriate in understanding the changing social
relations among older adults. Socioemotional selec-
tivity theory suggests that levels of social participa-
tion in late life are a culmination of strategic selec-
tions made throughout the life course to form social
networks that maximize social and emotional gains
and minimize social and emotional risks. The social
convoy model states that people age throughout the
life course, experiencing the stress of transitions and
turning points with a highly selected group of people
from whom they derive a basis for self-identity as well
as emotional and instrumental support.
Despite activity, continuity, and disengagement
theories' inimitable presence in social gerontology,
their explanatory power has fallen short in trying to
explain how or why older adults alter their social par-
ticipation in the face of widowhood. These classic
theories of aging cannot capture the diversity in reac-
tions or the processual nature of the human life
course, whereas developmental perspectives such as
socioemotional selectivity theory and the social con-
voy model may be more successful in understanding
the ongoing adjustments that unfold over the entire
life course. As opposed to the grand theories of so-
cial gerontology, middle-range theories that consider
unique life trajectories may provide the most promis-
ing avenue for future theory building related to late-
life stress and adjustment.
Limitations and Future Research
Although the CLOC data have provided both
empirical and theoretical findings related to old age
adjustment, no study is without limitations. Our
532 The Gerontologist
measure of social participation is an improvement on
earlier studies, in that it captures statistically and con-
ceptually unique realms of social engagement and
community involvement. By separating formal and
informal social roles, we were able to distinguish the
unique effects of spousal loss on two broad types of
social participation. Nevertheless, future research
may benefit from evaluating the effects of spousal loss
on even more specific types of social participation. In
addition, future research should consider including a
measure of the subjective meaning derived from each
type of activity, as past research has suggested that
rate of contact may not capture the emotional quality
of the relationship or activity (Rosow, 1967). Perhaps
the quality or value attached to an activity affects
one's willingness to adopt or abandon that role upon
widowhood. Future studies may also want to explore
the perceived stress associated with particular behav-
ioral changes, as this may expand understanding of
the mechanisms that create psychological distress fol-
lowing widowhood. The loss of marriage represents
not only the loss of a significant other, but the loss of
the instrumental arrangements between the couple
(Miller & Wortman, in press; Umberson et al., 1992).
The stress and strain produced by changes in the sur-
vivor's instrumental and social spheres may elucidate
the differential vulnerabilities to psychological dis-
tress following widowhood.
Future research should also consider the role of
couple-level characteristics that determine one's level
of social integration. We have found that the partner's
health status acutely influences the social activities of
older adults. This finding reiterates the importance of
considering individual behaviors within the context
of related social actors (Elder, 1998). Using couple-
level data, future research should explore the patterns
of social participation across the life course, paying
particular attention to transitions in marital status
and the underlying health characteristics of both hus-
band and wife. Consideration of both the husband
and the wife is necessary in order to understand the
dynamics of the marital relationship and the proces-
sual nature of widowhood.
Practical Applications and Implications
Finally, the results derived from the preceding anal-
yses should be extended to devise effective care and
support strategies for the recently bereaved. A clear
majority (87%) of widow(er)s admit to actively keep-
ing busy or getting involved as a way to cope with
feelings of grief and loneliness; therefore, increased
social activity is one way older adults can potentially
reduce the perceived psychological distress associated
with widowhood. Although prior research has consis-
tently found that higher levels of social integration
yield favorable physical and mental health outcomes
(Durkheim, 1897/1951; House et al., 1988; Lowenthal
& Haven, 1968; Thoits, 1983), we caution against as-
suming that activity for activity's sake is the most effec-
tive way to provide support for the recently bereaved.
Senior centers play a vital role in keeping older adults
engaged in the community. However, the vast major-
ity of older adults do not take advantage of such for-
mal integration efforts (Carstensen, 1991). Instead,
older adults, particularly those experiencing a devas-
tating or stressful loss such as widowhood, tend to
rely on the convoy of lifelong social relations from
whom they derive support, self-definition, and a sense
of stability and continuity (Antonucci & Jackson,
1987; Kahn & Antonucci, 1980). Our analyses illus-
trate that widowed persons, in both their intentions
and their behaviors, prefer to maintain the relation-
ships and activities that have been most meaningful
and rewarding throughout the life course. Thus, sim-
ply providing widowed persons with an abundance of
new activities will not be as effective as having others
(e.g., family members, friends, religious communities,
and neighbors) assist them in achieving a continuity
of lifestyle and stability in social relations.
Intervention efforts should aim to minimize the
disruption in social roles rather than maximize the
availability of compensatory social activities. One
such proposal is to offer affordable and flexible trans-
portation to older persons, especially to those who no
longer drive. The use of the telephone, the Internet,
and other means of communication that allow older
adults to maintain contact despite geographic dis-
tance or physical impairment (Litwak & Longino,
1987) may also be invaluable to successful adaptation
to widowhood. Although support via communication
technology may be a more effective support strategy
for future cohorts of older adults, any programmatic
or policy intervention should seek to minimize dis-
ruption in daily activities rather than to construct a
new life with new activities and new acquaintances.
Furthermore, intervention efforts should target those
persons most likely to benefit from the outreach ef-
forts. Our findings imply that persons with low socio-
economic resources and those with no children may
be particularly vulnerable to social isolation upon wid-
owhood. Also the soon-to-be widow(er) and those per-
sons with ailing spouses may need as much support as
recently widowed persons. Outreach efforts, therefore,
could be directed at married couples experiencing the
final stages of a spouse's life rather than only at those
persons who have recently lost spouses.
The findings from this study not only expand our
knowledge about the daily social adjustments that ac-
company late-life bereavement, but also add to the on-
going debates in social gerontology regarding the util-
ity of activity, disengagement, and continuity theories
to explain the variations in how individuals adapt to
the aging process. In addition, this article provides
multiple suggestions for future research and offers
practical implications that may help families and
practitioners offer more effective care and support to
the recently bereaved.
