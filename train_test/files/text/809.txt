Small-Business Winners And Losers Under Health Care Reform
by Catherine G. McLaughlin, Wendy K. Zellers, and Kevin D. Frick
Abstract: To meet its goal of universal health insurance coverage, the Clinton health plan requires
all employers to offer health insurance to their employees. Using survey data on more than 2,200
small businesses, we estimate how many firms and employees would be affected by this mandate and
calculate the financial burden, adjusting for the small-business subsidies recommended in the Clinton
plan. Because of the payroll caps, almost 60 percent of small businesses that now offer insurance will
experience a reduction in premiums. The average reduction is approximately $1,500 per full-time
equivalent (FTE) per year. The majority of firms that offer insurance and face an increase in liability
under the Clinton plan will incur an increase of less than $1,000 per FTE per year. Firms that do not
now offer insurance will incur, on average, a liability of $500 to $900 per FTE.
Aprimary reason for the relatively low level of health insurance
coverage among small-business employees is a lack of affordable
insurance products.1 Some workers and businesses also face struc-
tural barriers, such as redlining (eliminating entire business categories from
coverage), and attitudinal barriers, on the part of both employees who do
not want to trade wages for health insurance and employers who do not want
to make health insurance coverage available to their employees.2
Various health care reform proposals have included measures aimed at
reducing small businesses' financial and structural barriers to health insur-
ance. The Clinton health reform proposal, for instance, has a goal of
universal health insurance coverage. To reach this goal, the proposal would
require all employers to offer health insurance to their employees and to
share the premium payment. Other federal health care reform proposals and
legislative efforts in several states range from replacing employment-based
health insurance with individual insurance to encouraging the voluntary
formation of small-business purchasing pools.3 Most of these proposals
include some modification, if not outright elimination, of underwriting
practices that exclude individuals or businesses.
There has been considerable debate about the effect of the Clinton
mandate on the small-business community and disagreement about

whether proposals that do not mandate coverage at either the firm or
individual level are likely to increase coverage. We asked more than 2,200
small businesses in seven sites about characteristics of the firms, including
information about their health insurance coverage, the wages and insur-
ance coverage of workers, and attitudes toward various policy options. For
the purposes of this survey, small businesses were defined as those with
twenty-five or fewer employees working more than seventeen hours per
week. The sampling frame came from Dun and Bradstreet's DMI (Dun's
Marketing Inclusion). Self-employed persons were omitted from the sam-
ple. We contacted 2,759 eligible firms and completed interviews with
2,241, resulting in an overall response rate of 81 percent, which is substan-
tially higher than in most surveys of small businesses. The seven sites were
Cleveland, Denver, Flint, Pittsburgh, Portland, Tampa, and Tucson. The
telephone survey was conducted between October 1992 and February 1993.
Using these data, we estimate how many small businesses and employees in
these seven locations would be affected by a mandate, the percentage that
would be eligible for the subsidy, and how many would experience an
increase in or reduction of liability. We also report the results of local efforts
in some of these cities to increase coverage without mandates.
The Effects Of The Clinton Mandate
Coverage. Our results indicate that 50-65 percent of businesses with
fewer than twenty-five employees now offer health insurance. The level of
coverage increases with firm size, even within this group of small businesses
(Exhibit 1). Under the Clinton plan, one-third to half of these small
businesses will be required to begin offering insurance to their employees.
Businesses that already offer insurance also will be affected by this man-
date. According to our survey, approximately 8 percent of full-time workers
are not eligible for their firm's health insurance plan, and another 24

percent of eligible full-time workers choose not to participate. The level of
eligibility and the overall participation rate is lower for part-time workers.
Half of the part-time workers who work more than seventeen hours a week
are not eligible for their company's plan.4 Approximately one-fourth of
those part-time workers who are eligible choose not to participate. The
definition of who is eligible sometimes reflects insurance company under-
writing policies and sometimes employer preferences. The decision to par-
ticipate is influenced by several factors. Affordability is clearly an issue. In
some of these cities workers who do participate in their firm's plan earn, on
average, 50 percent more than workers who do not participate. Availability
of family coverage through a spouse's employer also plays an important role.
Approximately one-fourth of workers working seventeen or more hours
in firms that offer health insurance have coverage only through another
source. More than half of the workers employed by firms that do not offer
health insurance are reported to have coverage through another source.
Under the Clinton plan these "free riders" will no longer be able to shift the
cost of health insurance coverage to their spouse's employer.5
In some cities fewer than half of full-time workers participate in employ-
ment-based health insurance plans. Including part-time employees working
more than seventeen hours a week reduces the level of coverage to below
50 percent in all but one city (Exhibit 2). Requiring employers to cover all
employees working more than ten hours a week represents a dramatic
increase in liability. At the same time, altering the source of coverage for
the 17 to 37 percent who receive their only coverage through their spouse's
employment-based insurance will shift liability away from other employers.

In Tucson approximately 20,000 workers in small businesses participate
in employment-based health insurance, which represents 36 percent of
small-business employees. The Clinton mandate would shift the coverage
now received by more than 18,000 workers from another source to their
place of employment and add an additional 16,000 workers who now lack
health insurance. In Portland, where small businesses are more likely not
only to offer health insurance to their workers but also to have a higher
percentage of those workers eligible and enrolled, the redistribution effect
would be smaller: Approximately 72,000 workers now receive employment-
based health insurance (56 percent), 26,000 are covered through another
source, and 31,000 lack insurance.
Winners and losersÂ» The Clinton proposal couples the mandate with a
premium payment cap of 7.9 percent of total payroll for all firms. In
addition, it recommends subsidies to low-wage businesses with fewer than
seventy-five FTE employees in the form of reduced payment caps. The
maximum liability for a firm with fewer than twenty-five FTE employees
whose average annual salary per employee is less than or equal to $12,000 is
3.5 percent of total payroll. This liability gradually increases to 7.9 percent
of total payroll as the average annual salary rises above $24,000.
According to our survey results, approximately 80 percent of businesses
with fewer than twenty-five employees have an average annual salary per
FTE employee of less than $24,000 and therefore will be eligible for this
subsidy (Exhibit 3). In a city the size of Denver, this translates into almost
30,000 firms.6 This high degree of eligibility reflects, to a large degree, the
relatively low wages of workers in the small-business community. Close to
40 percent of firms that do not offer insurance have an average annual
salary per FTE employee of less than or equal to $12,000; only 6 percent of
these firms have an average annual salary of more than $24,000. Not
surprisingly, the distribution of firms that offer health insurance is different.
Although the majority (more than 70 percent) have an average annual

salary per FTE employee of less than $24,000 and are therefore eligible for
the subsidy, fewer than 10 percent are in the bottom wage category.
Overall, we calculate that 45 to 72 percent of those firms that currently
offer health insurance will be "winners;" that is, their maximum liability
will be less than their current payments for health insurance (Exhibit 4). In
Pittsburgh, which has the highest percentage of winners and whose firms
would experience relatively large gains, almost 9,000 businesses with fewer
than twenty-five workers face a reduction in their liability for health
insurance under this subsidized plan. Again, adding firms with up to
seventy-five FTEs, as is proposed in the Clinton plan, would increase the
number of winners. Given that firms with twenty-five to seventy-five FTEs
are more likely to offer insurance, we anticipate that a higher percentage
would see a reduction in liability under this plan.
The average size of the "win" ranges from $623 to $2,082 per FTE
employee per year (Exhibit 5). These numbers represent the minimum win
possible for each firm. In some cases, the actual liability may be lower
because of workers' characteristics and the type of coverage offered, and the
size of the win could be higher.7 Our findings suggest that winners are more
likely to be companies that insure most of their workers, that already pay at
least 80 percent of the premium for individual coverage (three-fourths of
these firms pay 100 percent) and at least part of dependent coverage, and
that offer a relatively rich set of benefits. Additionally, because of current
underwriting practices, firms engaged in actuarially high-risk businesses are
likely to be winners because of premiums that are high relative to the
community-rated premiums estimated in the Clinton plan.
As an illustration, one of the winners in our sample is a logging company
in Portland with fourteen employees who each earn, on average, slightly
more than $30,000 per year. The company pays nearly $96,000 per year for
its health insurance plan, which has no copayments for inpatient hospital

care. The company pays 100 percent of the premium for individual cover-
age and part for dependent coverage. The company now pays 37 percent of
total payroll in premium payments. Under the Clinton plan, the company's
maximum total liability would be $20,375.
Clearly, all firms that do not now offer health insurance will be "losers"
under the Clinton mandate; that is, they will have to pay for health
insurance. The size of their loss will vary, however, depending on the
average annual salary of their workers and the total payroll. We estimate
that the average maximum loss--in these cases, maximum total liability--
will be less than $350 per FTE employee per year for those firms with an
average annual salary of less than $12,000 per FTE employee (Exhibit 6).
There was little variation in this estimate across the seven sites. Depending
on the characteristics of its workers, a firm's actual loss may be lower
because of the various "rules" regarding payment for part-time workers with
multiple jobs, employed spouses, and so forth. The average loss increases to
almost $600 per FTE employee for firms with an average annual salary of
$12,000 to $15,000, approximately $1,000 per FTE employee for those with
an average annual salary of $15,000 to $21,000, and $2,000 per FTE
employee for the higher-wage firms.
Of small businesses that do offer health insurance, 28 to 55 percent likely
would pay more in total premium payments under President Clinton's plan.
As was the case for firms that do not offer insurance, the average size of the
maximum loss for the lower-wage firms, those whose average annual salary
per FTE employee is less than $12,000, was less than $350 per FTE em-
ployee per year. In large part because of the decreasing subsidy, the size of
the loss increases steadily as the average annual salary per FTE employee
increases. For firms whose average annual salary per FTE is less than or

equal to $21,000, the average loss ranges from approximately $400 to $500
per FTE; for those with an average annual salary per FTE greater than
$21,000, the loss ranges from close to $800 to more than $1,200 per FTE
(Exhibit 5). The variation in the size of the loss across different sites reflects
different compositions of firms by wage category as well as different concen-
trations of firm characteristics that determine whether or not the firm
would experience a loss.
There are several reasons why a firm that now offers health insurance
would face an increase in premium payments. One of the main reasons is
the increase in the percentage of workers participating. In several of our
sites workers in these firms were half as likely to have employment-based
insurance as workers in firms that would be winners under the plan. Even
with a payment cap of 3.5 percent of payroll, approximately one out of five
firms that already offer insurance, with an average annual salary of less than
$12,000 per FTE employee, would experience an increase in liability. On
average, these firms have fewer than 10 percent of employees who work
more than seventeen hours a week enrolled in their plans.
Another reason for the increase is the 80 percent employer share pro-
posed, which represents a substantial increase for many of these firms. This
is particularly true in Tucson, where almost 60 percent of these firms now
pay less than 80 percent of their workers' premiums. In addition, firms that
will experience an increase are less likely to be paying any dependent
coverage now. Finally, the payroll cap set by the plan may represent an
increase in premiums, perhaps because of an increase in the number of
employees with dependent coverage, or perhaps because of a richer benefit
package.
Labor market. Many critics of the Clinton plan are concerned that the
increase in labor costs associated with mandatory health insurance will

228 HEALTH AFFAIRS | Spring (II) 1994
result in increased unemployment. While there is some variation across
sites, approximately 60 percent of the employees in our sample work in
firms that would be losers under this plan, which translates into more than
400,000 workers in these seven sites. On average, these workers are evenly
split between firms that already offer insurance but would face an increased
liability and firms that do not now offer insurance.
While $350 per FTE employee should neither pose a serious burden nor
result in a significant increase in unemployment, some small businesses face
considerably larger losses. Not surprisingly, the size of the loss increases as
the average annual salary per FTE employee increases. On average, higher-
wage firms that do not now offer insurance would experience a loss closer to
$2,000 per FTE worker; the loss faced by higher-wage firms that do offer
insurance is close to $1,000.
Wages. Although historically wages have been "sticky downward"--that
is, slow to fall in response to market forces--we would expect employers to
transfer this increase in liability for health insurance onto the employees in
the form of lower wages where possible as soon as possible.8 Because of the
notch effect inherent in any graduated subsidy system such as this, some
firms that negotiate lower wages with some or all of their employees will not
only maintain the same total compensation package as before the mandate
but will also experience a decrease in total liability because of both a lower
total payroll and a lower premium cap.
Response of small businesses. This survey was conducted before the
release of the Clinton administration's plan, and therefore we did not ask
the firms how they would respond to the specific mandate proposed. We did
ask them how they would respond to a play-or-pay health insurance man-
date, wherein employers pay for their workers' coverage or face a tax to do
so. Consistently across all seven sites, approximately one-third of those that
do not now offer health insurance said that they would decrease their
number of workers; a third said that they would decrease wages or other
benefits; and more than half said that they would increase the price of their
goods or services.9 It is intriguing that one-third of the firms plan to increase
prices but not decrease wages or the number of workers. Only under very
restrictive circumstances could firms pass on the entire increase in labor
costs to the consumer in the form of higher prices.
The Impact Of Voluntary Efforts
Small-business health insurance pools. Several proposals have sug-
gested that establishing small-business health insurance pools would sub-
stantially lower the number of working uninsured. In theory, these pools
would result in lower premiums: The large numbers of uninsured workers

pooled would reduce risk of adverse selection, decrease marketing and sales
costs to insurers, and increase bargaining power. When asked whether
having such a pool would influence their decision to offer health insurance,
62 to 83 percent of small businesses that have not offered health insurance
in the past five years said yes. Two of our sites have such pools; these areas
provide some insight into pools' influence on the market.
The Council of Smaller Enterprises (COSE) in Cleveland is often held
up as an example. COSE is one of four divisions within the Greater
Cleveland Area Growth Association, the area's Chamber of Commerce.
Only members of the Growth Association are eligible to belong to COSE.
COSE now offers thirteen different health insurance plans to its members,
through Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Ohio and Kaiser Permanente. By its
own account, COSE engages in heavy underwriting.
According to our survey, almost one-fourth of the small businesses in
Cleveland are enrolled in a COSE plan; approximately 40 percent of the
small businesses that offer insurance in Cleveland offer a COSE plan.
While we were not able to isolate the effect of COSE on the small-business
health insurance market, we did find that only a slightly larger percentage
of small businesses in Cleveland offer health insurance than in Pittsburgh,
a city of similar size and business composition (65 percent versus 59 per-
cent) and that small businesses in Portland were equally likely to offer
health insurance without the existence of a pool such as COSE. The small
impact is not due to lack of information about COSE. Almost 85 percent of
those firms that do not offer insurance claimed that they had heard of
COSE. About one-fifth of those surveyed who had heard of COSE but who
do not offer health insurance said that the poor health of one or more
employees was a reason why they do not offer health insurance. Just as in all
of our sites, however, the dominant reason given by these firms for not
offering insurance was cost. Slightly more than 60 percent said that the
existence of a pool that resulted in lower premiums would influence their
decision to offer health insurance. Clearly, many of these firms did not
think that the reduction in premiums achieved by COSE was enough.
Tampa is the home of a voluntary small-business insurance pool called
the Florida Health Access Corporation (FHAC) that offers a subsidized
health insurance plan. The state subsidizes this plan by providing a subsidy
for dependent coverage, administrative and marketing costs, and reinsur-
ance. The resulting premium offered by a local health maintenance organi-
zation (HMO) was estimated to be 25 percent lower than the market
premium for equivalent plans.10 In contrast to COSE, which accepts mem-
ber firms with insurance who want to switch to a lower-price plan as well as
qualified firms without insurance, FHAC targets small firms that have not
provided coverage for the previous six months.

230 HEALTH AFFAIRS | Spring (II) 1994
Again, it is impossible to control for all determinants of small-business
coverage, but with 54 percent of the small-business community offering
health insurance, Tampa has the next-to-lowest rate of coverage in our
sample. We estimate that fewer than 5 percent of the small businesses in
Tampa are enrolled in the subsidized plan sponsored by this pool; approxi-
mately 7 percent of those with insurance chose this plan. These figures are
substantially lower than those reported two years ago.11 We do not know
how much of this drop is due to reduction in enrollment and how much to
reporting error. Almost 14 percent of those who said that they had heard of
this program said that they were members. Even though we asked to speak
to the person most knowledgeable about the firm's benefit plans, it is
possible that some of those who said that they had not heard of the plan
were in fact enrolled in it.
It is not obvious from our survey results why this plan has not been more
successful. While this plan does not have the same degree of name recogni-
tion as does COSE, close to 40 percent of employers that do not offer health
insurance in their firms had heard of the plan. Even though firms in Tampa
that do not offer insurance are actually more likely to report that they are
interested in offering insurance than those in other sites, only one-third
said that they were interested, and only one-fourth actually had someone at
the firm shopping for insurance. As with all of our sites, more than three-
fourths reported that costs are the major barrier, even with the availability
of this heavily subsidized plan. Another barrier to its success may be that
the plan offered is an HMO. Small businesses may see an HMO as repre-
senting a limited choice of providers. Of six different policy options offered,
the availability of a low-cost, limited-choice plan was the least popular
among our firms. Only 40 percent of Tampa firms without health insurance
said that this would influence them to offer coverage.
Low-cost, reduced-benefit plans. Another strategy in many small-
business benefit markets is to offer a plan that lowers premiums by reducing
the scope of the benefits. About half of our firms said that the availability
of low-cost, reduced-benefit plans would influence their decision to offer
health insurance. We were able to look at the market penetration rate of
one such plan.
U.S. Life Insurance Company has underwritten and administered a low-
cost, reduced-benefit plan developed and marketed by the Denver Depart-
ment of Health and Hospitals. This offering, called the Shared Cost Option
Plan for Private Employers (SCOPE), met with what can only be called
limited success. Although almost 30 percent of those without insurance had
heard of this plan, after three years of marketing only 1 percent of small
businesses are enrolled in the plan, and less than 2 percent of those with
insurance choose the plan. Even though cost is the primary reason given for

not offering insurance, apparently achieving lower premiums through a
reduction in benefits is not attractive to most small businesses. Firms in
Denver that did not offer insurance coverage were more likely than those in
the other sites to say that the fact that lower-cost plans usually offer lower
benefits is an important reason why they do not offer insurance.
Lower-cost, limited-choice plans. Another way to lower premiums is
to reduce choice of provider. The Clinton plan's reliance on managed care
plans represents to many a reduction in choice. This was the least popular
option offered to our firms. The HMO market has made few inroads into
the small-business market. We can gain limited insight into the willingness
of small businesses to enroll in an HMO by looking at the penetration rates
of HMOs in two of our sites: Tampa and Tucson. As discussed above, the
HMO offered by the state-subsidized pool in Tampa has met with limited
success. In Tucson approximately 4 percent of the small businesses offering
insurance are enrolled in an HMO offered through the Arizona Health
Care Group (HCG), a state-sponsored program. Only firms that have gone
uncovered for a specified period of time are eligible; there is minimal
administrative support provided by the state and no direct premium subsi-
dies. In addition to these limitations, another reason for the small enroll-
ment in this case may be exposure. Only one-fifth of the firms had heard of
the plan. A final limiting factor may have been that the HMOs offered were
also participants in Arizona's Health Care Cost Containment System
(AHCCCS), which serves the Medicaid population.
Here again, although cost is the primary reason cited, small businesses do
not want to give up choice or perceived quality to achieve those lower
costs. In fact, two-thirds to three-fourths of the small businesses surveyed in
all seven sites said that the only options that would influence them to offer
insurance involved reducing the cost to employers or employees through
direct government subsidies.
Study Implications
Our few examples indicate that voluntary efforts are not likely to yield
large increases in the numbers of small-business employees with employ-
ment-based health insurance. Even with lower-cost options in the market,
a third or more of small businesses in our survey do not offer insurance to
their employees, more than half of employees working more than seventeen
hours a week were without employment-based coverage, and more than
one-fifth were without any coverage at all. Some of this may reflect insurers'
underwriting practices, which disproportionately affect small businesses
and their employees. Such exclusions were given as important reasons for
not offering health insurance by approximately one-third of the businesses

that had not offered health insurance in the past five years. Eighty percent
of all businesses supported a law that required insurance companies to
accept all small businesses that seek health insurance.
The removal of underwriting will not lead to universal health insurance
coverage in the small-business market, however. In addition to the af-
fordability issue, some small-business owners just do not want to offer
health insurance to their employees.12 Fewer than one-third of those not
offering health insurance said that they were interested in making a health
plan available to their workers (Exhibit 7).
If the goal of a reformed health system is universal health insurance
coverage, some form of mandate seems inevitable. We have presented
first-cut estimates of the costs to small businesses under one mandate plan.
As with most such plans, there would be winners and losers, at both the
firm and the individual employee levels. Our results suggest that the health
care reform discussion should center on the benefits of universal coverage
relative to the costs of different kinds of mandates, not on whether a
mandate is necessary to achieve universal coverage.
Support for this research came from The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

5. While in theory the cost ofhealth insurance coverage is borne by the employee through
reduced wages, not by the employer, in practice most firms do not negotiate individual
compensation packages for each employee in which wages are altered to reflect
individual versus family health insurance coverage.
6. Several definitional and data issues limit our ability to provide estimates that have a
one-to-one correspondence to the Clinton proposal. The proposals calculation of a
business's FTE employees includes all employees working ten or more hours per week,
with thirty hours a week equal to one FTE employee. Only businesses with fewer than
twenty-five employees working seventeen or more hours a week were eligible for our
study, and these were the employees for whom we collected information on wages and
hours. Therefore, our FTE counts are slightly lower than those that include employees
working ten to seventeen hours per week, and our sample underestimates the number
of firms with twenty-five or fewer FTE employees in these cities. In addition, it is not
clear from the proposal how the earnings of the owner(s) are handled in the calculation
of annual average wages. We experienced considerable reporting error for this variable
in an earlier survey of small businesses. Many owners told us, "We don't get paid
anything. We just take what we need." Others refused to give us even ranges. Given
these problems, we elected not to include owner wages. Depending on how the Clinton
plan would handle owner income, this inclusion could increase or decrease the average
annual wage per FTE employee.
7. We calculated the maximum loss and the minimum win for each firm by doing the
following. We calculated the annual earnings of each employee and then aggregated
across employees to get the total annual employee wages of a firm. We divided this by
the number of FTEs, limited to those employees working more than seventeen hours a
week as noted above, to get the average annual wages per FTE. We then classified firms
according to the six groups established in the Clinton proposal, assigned the appropriate
premium cap to each firm, and calculated their maximum liability. For firms that do
not now offer health insurance, this figure represents their maximum loss. For firms
offering insurance, we subtracted their maximum liability from their current annual
premium payments. A positive value represents the minimum win, a negative value the
maximum loss. Again, the loss could be smaller. There were a few firms in fact whose
maximum losses were small enough (in one case, $5 per FTE) that their specific
situation could result in a net win. This reversal is not likely for most of our firms,
however, because losses were fairly large.
8. For example, it will not be possible for employers to make this substitution for workers
at or near the minimum wage.
9. The percentages do not sum to 100 because respondents were allowed to answer
positively to more than one action. More than one-third said that they would only
increase prices; 10 percent would only decrease wages and benefits; and 10 percent
would only decrease the number of employees.

Wood Johnson Foundation; the Denver and Tucson sites also were demonstration sites.
