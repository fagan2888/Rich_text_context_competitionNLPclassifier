The present studies have implications for broader under-
standing of the collective nature of consciousness and also
for the prevention of homicide and violent crime. They focus
on the macro-level of society and propose that a positive
impact on the collective consciousness of society can be pre-
dicted, generated, and its influence measured in terms of
decreased homicide and violent crime.
Although the rates of violent crime and murder in the
United States have declined significantly since the early
1990s and again since 2006 (Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation, 2011), the cause of that decline remains, in large
part, unclear to behavioral and social scientists, with factors
discussed for the 1990s decline including police numbers
and policing strategies, changing demographics, reduction of
childhood exposure to lead, increased prison populations,
waning crack market, immigration, and improved security
measures (Farrell, 2013; Levitt, 2004). As a result, policy
makers lack clear direction for effecting further reduction.
The rate of murder in the United States remains higher than
other developed countries such as Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, and the countries of Western Europe (United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2011), and thus, further
insight into any factors contributing to violent crime that can
be influenced by intervention is very valuable.
A number of theories have historically been proposed to
account for the incidence of homicide and violent crime,
reflecting what may well be a multicausal phenomenon. One
distinction among theories of violent crime is between theo-
ries that emphasize its social and ecological conditions
(places) and theories that emphasize the individuals (people)
most susceptible to crimes. For example, social disorganiza-
tion theory has historically focused on the community fac-
tors such as poverty, residential instability, and social
networks that influence a community's ability to control
behavior (Kubrin & Weitzer, 2003) and was substantially
developed by the work of Shaw and McKay (1942/1969)
who found that the Chicago neighborhood factors predicted
delinquency rates over time despite the neighborhoods'
changing ethnic or racial makeup. The present study con-
cerns short-term changes in the national level of homicide
and violent crime rather than prediction of community varia-
tions, so the social disorganization perspective is of limited
relevance, although prior research related to the hypothesis
of this study, reviewed below, controls for, and thus appears
independent of, many community-related variables.

Societal Violence and Collective
Consciousness: Reduction of U.S.
Homicide and Urban Violent Crime Rates
Michael C. Dillbeck1 and Kenneth L. Cavanaugh1
Abstract
This research tests the hypothesis that group practice of the Transcendental Meditation® (TM) and TM-Sidhi® program
by a group of sufficient size is associated with reduced rates of homicide and violent crime. Data from a prospective quasi-
experiment were analyzed using intervention analysis or interrupted time series analysis. Dependent variables are time series
of the U.S. monthly homicide rate as well as violent crime rate from a sample of 206 cities. The binary intervention variable
is based on the size of the largest U.S. TM-Sidhi group. Intervention effects were analyzed by time series regression using
a broken-trend intervention model. As hypothesized, there was a statistically and practically significant shift in trend in the
direction of reduced rates for each of the variables beginning with the onset of the intervention period. Diagnostic tests
indicate that key statistical assumptions of the analysis are satisfied. Alternative hypotheses are considered for the apparent
effect of macro-level social behavioral change without micro-level behavioral interaction.

One process that can be seen in a number of theories is the
connection between frustration and aggression. This frustra-
tion might arise from strain due to lack of economic opportu-
nity for advancement (Cloward & Ohlin, 1960; Merton,
1938), or due to poverty (Hsieh & Pugh, 1993), or due to
inability to avoid aversive situations and achieve goals
(Agnew, 2007), or due to social disruption or disorganiza-
tion, affecting family and community structures (Shaw &
McKay, 1942/1969) that might otherwise avert frustration or
at least control aggression.
The study of social stress (Linsky, Bachman, & Straus,
1995; Linsky & Straus, 1986) provides an interesting theo-
retical perspective on the frustration-aggression process
that has the advantage of connecting with a large body of
research on stress at the individual level (e.g., Mueller,
1983; Selye, 1956). Linsky and Straus (1986) found that the
degree of social stress was a strong predictor of violent
crime rate (VCR) among the states of the United States,
using a state stress index (SSI) of 1976 data to quantify
economic, family, and community stressors. The relation-
ship of the SSI to rates of homicide, rape, robbery, and
aggravated assault was significant taking into account a
number of control and potentially moderating variables.
The creation of the SSI was based on the "life events"
approach to conceptualization of stress, assuming that the
accumulation of many challenging events places increasing
stress on the individual, with potentially negative health
consequences (Holmes & Masuda, 1974). Because this life-
events approach to defining stress is applied to societal
rather than individual data, there is considerable overlap of
variables considered by the social stress approach and
social disorganization theory, and Linsky and Straus (1986)
analyzed the area of commonality and uniqueness in these
two conceptualizations. Subsequently, Linsky et al. (1995)
replicated the finding of an association between higher
social stress (measured by the SSI with 1982 data) and
higher homicide rate (HOM). Controlling for urbanization
and racial composition of the states, the relationship of
social stress to homicide was also independent of indices
meant to measure weak social control, economic depriva-
tion, and cultural support for violence.
At the individual level, some of the behavioral and physi-
ological effects of stress have been found associated with
aggression. For example, offenders guilty of homicide were
found to have more stressful and more chronically stressful
life experiences than nonviolent offenders (Humphrey &
Palmer, 1986). Disruption of parenting and of family func-
tioning, a significant stress for the growing child, has been
found to be a major mediating factor for the historically stud-
ied societal influences of poverty and social disorganization
that contribute to high rates of crime and delinquency
(Moore, 2001; Weatherburn & Lind, 2006). Many of the
physiological imbalances consequent to repeated stress have
been found to be associated with aggression and violence
(Walton & Levitsky, 2003).
The intervention investigated in this study is a practice
found by previous research to reduce stress and crime at the
individual and social levels, the Transcendental Medita-
tion® technique and its advanced practice, the TM-Sidhi®
program.1 The Transcendental Meditation technique is a
mental procedure founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and
introduced to the West from India in the late 1950s; it is prac-
ticed 15 to 20 min twice daily and is described as systematic
but involving no effort, beliefs, or specific lifestyle and
requiring no specific mental abilities on the part of the prac-
titioner (Roth, 1994). The procedure is said to allow the indi-
vidual to experience more silent levels of awareness, leading
to the experience of "pure consciousness"--consciousness
without the mental activity of perception or thought
(Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1967). The advanced TM-Sidhi
program, practiced following Transcendental Meditation, is
said to develop the ability to function from this silent mental
state of pure consciousness and thereby activate this field of
pure consciousness more effectively for greater impact on
the individual and society (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1986).
The implications of a "field" character of pure consciousness
for societal effects are noted below. Group practice of the
TM-Sidhi program is identical to individual practice except
for large number of individuals being together.
During Transcendental Meditation, the process of
increased mental silence has been found to correspond to a
distinct physiological state of restful alertness that is associ-
ated, in comparison with eyes-closed rest, with reduced
respiratory rate, reduced plasma lactate levels, reduced skin
conductance, greater excretion of the serotonin metabolite
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and increased coherence of
electroencephalographic activity, particularly in the frontal
cortex (Bujatti & Riederer, 1976; Dillbeck & Bronson, 1981;
Dillbeck & Orme-Johnson, 1987; Travis & Arenander,
2006). Outside of the practice, randomized controlled
research found greater integration of brain functioning dur-
ing task performance and more effective galvanic skin resis-
tance responses to stress among those learning and practicing
the Transcendental Meditation technique over a 10-week
period in contrast to controls (Travis et al., 2009).
In research on the individual level related to violent crime,
longitudinal studies among prison inmates, either using ran-
domized controlled trial (Ramirez, 1989), matched group
(Abrams & Siegel, 1978), or active control group (Alexander
& Orme-Johnson, 2003) designs, have indicated a corre-
sponding reduction in hostility, aggression, and neuroticism
among those learning the Transcendental Meditation tech-
nique compared with controls. In addition, they indicate
reduced recidivism for periods of study ranging from 3 to 15
years after release (Alexander, Rainforth, Frank, Grant, &
von Stade, 2003; Bleick & Abrams, 1987; Rainforth,
Alexander, & Cavanaugh, 2003).
There is also a body of research on the application of the
Transcendental Meditation technique for crime prevention
on the broader societal level, especially through group
Dillbeck and Cavanaugh 3
practice of the advanced TM-Sidhi program. This research
began in the late 1970s and 1980s to test a prediction derived
from the Vedic tradition of knowledge by the founder of
these practices that as few as 1% of the population of a soci-
ety practicing Transcendental Meditation, or as few as the
square root of that number practicing the advanced TM-Sidhi
program together as a group twice daily, would have a stress-
reducing effect of greater harmony on the collective con-
sciousness of the whole society (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi,
1977, 1986). In both cases, this prediction rests on the theo-
retical premise that there is an underlying level of connection
between individuals (as noted above, termed a field of pure
consciousness) through which coherence may be propagated,
or stress reduced, in society. The square root term in the pre-
dicted effect of group practice of the TM-Sidhi program
derives from the study of coherent systems in physics, in
which the combined intensity of coherent elements is pro-
portional to the square of the number of elements (Hagelin,
1987, p. 65). Due to the nonlinear nature of the square root
formula for this predicted effect of group practice of the
TM-Sidhi program, it would be possible to influence very
large social units; for example 1% of a city of one million
people would require a TM-Sidhi group of 100, or for the
current U.S. population, a group of almost 1,800.
A number of published studies have examined this pre-
dicted effect for crime and violence reduction at the city,
state, national, and regional or international levels. (In the
research studies, this effect has been termed the Maharishi
effect after Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who predicted it as early
as 1960 based on the Vedic knowledge.) The early studies
examined the percentage of Transcendental Meditation par-
ticipants in cities in relation to crime rate changes using
annual data. The first published study found that when small
cities reached 1% of their population instructed in the
Transcendental Meditation technique, they showed reduced
rate of FBI Part 1 crimes the next year and a decreasing trend
the following years, compared with matched control cities.
This study statistically controlled for eight candidate crime-
related demographic variables on which the groups of cities
differed: population, population density, median education,
population stability, per capita income, percentage below
poverty level, unemployment, and percentage aged 15 to 29
(Dillbeck, Landrith, & Orme-Johnson, 1981). Two studies,
using cross-lagged panel analysis among random samples of
160 cities and of 80 metropolitan areas, were consistent with
the hypothesis of a causal influence of the proportion of
Transcendental Meditation participants on decreased crime
rate. The cross-lagged panel analysis examined patterns of
correlation over time using either raw correlations or partial
correlations, controlling for demographic variables that were
predictive of crime in those samples (Dillbeck, Banus,
Polanzi, & Landrith, 1988). That is, increased Transcendental
Meditation participation predicted decreased crime rate, but
not vice versa. In the cross-lagged panel analysis of cities,
the 10 variables serving as potential statistical controls were
equivalent to the list above (for Dillbeck et al., 1981) with
the addition of police per population and the use of two age
distribution indicators--median age and percentage above
age 65. In the cross-lagged panel analysis of metropolitan
areas, the 13 demographic control variables examined also
included change in population since last census, area,
African-American population, change in African-American
population since last census, and college students (police
coverage and population above age 65 were not available at
the metropolitan level). Based on these city and metropolitan
area studies, the effect under study seems to be independent
of the demographic variables used to predict crime at the
urban level.
The advantage of subsequent studies on group practice of
the advanced TM-Sidhi program and social indicators is that
the greater hypothesized societal effect (1%) allows quasi-
experimental interventions to be performed using a finer
time scale of analysis when groups of TM-Sidhi program
participants are brought together temporarily or when more
permanent groups are created. To be explicit, the decision
rule used to predict a hypothesized influence in a specific
location and time has been to predict an effect during, or
immediately after, the time when the size of the TM-Sidhi
group reaches 1% of the population of the largest social unit
for which consistent objective behavioral data are available.
"Social unit" has been operationalized in terms of govern-
mental/administrative units--city, metropolitan area, state,
and nation. Extending this prediction principle to the regional
or international level, an effect was predicted when the size
of the group reached 1% of the combined population of
adjacent countries (Assimakis & Dillbeck, 1995) or the com-
bined population of all countries within a given distance
from the group (Davies & Alexander, 2005) or the combined
population globally (Orme-Johnson, Dillbeck, & Alexander,
2003).
Most of the TM-Sidhi group studies have used autore-
gressive integrated moving averages time series analysis
(Box & Jenkins, 1976) to rigorously estimate the effect on
societal parameters of specific periods in which large groups
of TM-Sidhi program participants practicing together twice
daily have been established for various lengths of time; these
statistical methods model and control for the time depen-
dence of the outcome measures, including seasonality and
trends. For example, Dillbeck, Cavanaugh, Glenn, Orme-
Johnson, and Mittlefehldt (1987) reported three intervention
studies in which reduced crime totals were found at the met-
ropolitan or territorial level during temporary intervention
periods when groups of TM-Sidhi participants exceeding the
predicted threshold were brought together in the union terri-
tory of Delhi, India (daily Indian Penal Code crime totals); in
Metro Manila, the Philippines (weekly crime index totals,
parallel to FBI uniform crime index prior to 1979); and in
Puerto Rico (monthly Type 1 crimes, also equivalent to pre-
1979 FBI uniform crime index). An examination of possible
alternative explanations for these time-specific effects,
4 SAGE Open
including an analysis by a third party in the case of the Delhi
results, did not locate a viable alternative. The time series
methodology of these studies and the findings were repli-
cated in metropolitan Merseyside, United Kingdom, using
monthly crime rates from police-reported crime totals
(Hatchard, Deans, Cavanaugh, & Orme-Johnson, 1996).
Two time series transfer function studies that analyzed
weekly data from metropolitan Washington, D.C. (1981-
1983 and 1993), found reduced violent crime associated with
the creation of large groups of TM-Sidhi program partici-
pants, the effect varying with the size of the group (each
group was above the predicted threshold during the periods
of the study; Dillbeck et al., 1988; Hagelin et al., 1999). The
first study measured FBI violent crime totals, estimating a
9% decrease, and did not find evidence supporting the alter-
native hypotheses of demographic changes (youth popula-
tion), neighborhood crime watch programs, or changes in
police coverage (Dillbeck et al., 1988). The 1993 transfer
function study in Washington D.C., (Hagelin et al., 1999)
was a prospective study in which predictions were given in
advance to a 27-member project review board of academic
and civic leaders. Due to different seasonal patterns, it sepa-
rately analyzed homicide, rape, and aggravated assault data
(termed HRA crimes in the study) from robbery data, the
fourth violent crime subcategory, and subsequently jointly
estimated the two models for these two categories, yielding a
reduction for total violent crime of 15.6%. The HRA analysis
controlled for weekly variations in temperature, which were
strongly positively associated with those crimes; in the case
of modeling robberies, the prior seasonal pattern (1988-
1992) was included as a significant predictor. These were the
only control variables found to be significant by multiple
regression, from a set of potential control variables that
included seasonal crime cycles, temperature, precipitation,
humidity, daylight hours, changes in police and community
anti-crime activities, prior crime trends in Washington D.C.,
and concurrent crime trends in New York and Philadelphia
(Hagelin et al., 1999).
A similar transfer function analysis found reduced daily
crime totals in Jerusalem and also in Israel as a whole, as
well as changes in other dependent variables, following
increases in the size of a group of TM-Sidhi program partici-
pants (Orme-Johnson, Alexander, Davies, Chandler, &
Larimore, 1988). The authors subsequently responded to a
methodological critique by showing their time series conclu-
sions to be independent of the stochastic "noise" model spec-
ified (Orme-Johnson, Alexander, & Davies, 1990). Studies
using both transfer function and intervention time series
methods found reduction in violent deaths as measured
weekly by the total of homicides, suicide, and motor vehicle
fatalities at the national level in the United States and Canada
in the 1980s when the size of a large group of TM-Sidhi par-
ticipants was above the predicted threshold for the United
States and for the United States plus Canada, respectively,
(Assimakis & Dillbeck, 1995; Dillbeck, 1990).
The purpose of the two studies reported here was to evaluate
the effect, on homicide and violent crime at the national level in
the United States, of a recently established large group of
TM-Sidhi program participants that has, for a period, reached
sufficient size to predict a national effect. The rapid establish-
ment of this group offered a clear opportunity for intervention
research. This research is designed as a quasi-experimental
intervention, for which the intervention variable broadly
approximates a step function, and this is simply modeled by a
binary variable. The central hypothesis, consistent with prior
research, is that of a significant impact of the independent vari-
able in terms of decreased rates of homicide and violent crime.
General Method
Intervention
The studies reported in this article use time series regression
to assess whether there is a change of trend in measures of
U.S. homicide and violent crime associated with an interven-
tion based on group practice of the TM-Sidhi program. To
assess the predicted effect on HOM and VCR of the largest
group of TM-Sidhi participants in North America, the inde-
pendent (intervention) variable used in the analysis was a
binary intervention indicator based on the size of this group.
This group is located in Fairfield, Iowa, at Maharishi
University of Management, where students, faculty, staff,
andcommunitymembersgathertopracticetheTranscendental
Meditation and TM-Sidhi program together before and after
the school or workday. Daily totals are recorded morning and
evening from the meditation halls on campus.
Starting in July 2006, a concerted effort was made by uni-
versity leaders to expand the size of the TM-Sidhi program
group from less than 1,000 to a number sufficient to predict
a positive influence generated for the whole population of
the United States (approximately 1,725 needed for the 297
million population at that time, according to the 1% for-
mula). At the time of inaugurating the endeavor, based on the
theoretical principles and previous research, reduced violent
crime was publicly predicted to be a measurable effect when
the size of the group was sufficiently large. A course was
held (termed Invincible America Assembly) for visitors from
other parts of the country and world.2 To further supplement
the size of the group, a special program was created starting
in November 2006 for a large group of several hundred visit-
ing Indian experts in the TM-Sidhi program on a nearby
campus. As a result, the size of the groups began to exceed
the predicted threshold in January 2007.
The binary intervention variable (I
t
) was specified as 0
from July 2001 to December 2006, and 1 from January 2007
to December 2010. (At the time of beginning the study, this
was the full time series possible, since 2010 was the latest
year for which homicide and crime data files containing
monthly data were available, and archival data for the group
size had been lost for several years prior to July 2001.)
Dillbeck and Cavanaugh 5
Data Analysis
The statistical analysis empirically tests the hypothesis that a
significant reduction in the trend rate of growth of homicide
and violent crime occurred beginning with the onset of the
intervention period in January 2007. The outcome measures
include the U.S. national HOM as well as the VCR and rate of
murder with non-negligent manslaughter (MUR) in 206
larger cities that report uninterrupted monthly data for these
measures. To analyze the results of this prospective quasi-
experiment, we use intervention analysis or interrupted time
series analysis (Chelimsky, Shadish, & Orwin, 1997; Cook &
Campbell, 1979; Marcantonio & Cook, 1994; Mark,
Reichardt, & Sanna, 2000; Shadish, Cook, & Campbell,
2002). The statistical analysis of monthly data for 2002-2010
uses time series regression to estimate a broken-trend, or seg-
mented-trend, intervention model for each outcome variable
(Perron, 1989; Rappoport & Reichlin, 1989). The interven-
tion model in each case includes a pre-intervention linear
trend with an exogenous structural break at the theoretically
predicted date of December 2006. As noted above, a shift to a
decreased rate of growth in homicide and violent crime begin-
ning in January 2007 was predicted because in that month the
average daily size of the TM-Sidhi group in Fairfield, Iowa,
exceeded the theoretically predicted critical threshold of 1%
of the U.S. population and remained above or relatively near
that level for the final 4 years of the sample.
Study 1--National HOM
Dependent Variable
The dependent monthly variable for Study 1 was national
U.S. rate of homicide (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention [CDC], 2012). The homicide data were converted
into rates per 100 million population using U.S. total popula-
tion estimates calculated by monthly linear interpolation
between the two U.S. census counts of April 2000 and April
2010 (and extended to later months of 2010 by assuming the
same rate of change). This rate was further divided by the
number of days in the month. This last operation was to
equate all the months in length, so that any annual seasonal-
ity would be the result of annual factors that were not simply
the sequential pattern of number of days in the month. Thus,
the monthly figure represents the daily rate of homicide for
that month per 100 million population.
Results
Plot of monthly U.S. HOM. Panel (a) of Figure 1 displays the
plot of HOM, and panel (b) shows the plot of the average
daily size of the TM-Sidhi group (GROUP) for each month.
The sample is November 2002 through December 2010, with
effective sample size T = 98, which is used for all statistical
analyses reported below. The initial date of the sample was
selected to avoid large outliers associated with the huge
spike in homicide totals due to the September 11 tragedy in
2001 and give the largest possible sample after allowing for
lags and differencing of outcome variables required in diag-
nostic testing of the statistical assumption of stationarity.
Strong monthly seasonal variation in HOM is apparent in
the plot as well as a relatively flat overall trend in the pre-
intervention period. With the onset of the intervention period
in January 2007 (shown by the vertical line), HOM displays
a shift to a declining trend that continues through the end of
the sample.
In January 2007, the monthly average daily size of the
TM-Sidhi group reached 1,748, rising for the first time in the
sample above the predicted critical threshold of 1,725, the
1% of the U.S. population at that time. From July 2006,
when the larger Iowa assembly began, through January 2007,
the average size of the group rose rapidly from the level of
391 participants in June 2006. The average size of the group
is 587 participants for the 50 months of the pre-intervention
period and 1,792 for the 48 months of the intervention period.
The GROUP series thus approximates a step function, with
the group size well below threshold in the pre-intervention
period and above or relatively near it in the intervention
period. Thus, in the broken-trend model described below, the
intervention component is modeled as a binary (0-1) step
function (I
t
) that triggers a shift in the trend function at the
end of the pre-intervention period.
Regression results for HOM.To test the hypothesis of a
decrease in the growth rate for HOM, we estimate the follow-
ing broken-trend, piecewise-linear intervention model that
incorporates a shift of linear trend beginning with the onset
of the intervention period (January 2007):

cator variable (step function) that takes the value 0 for the
pre-intervention period and 1 for the intervention period (t >

) for DT
t
gives the
change in the growth rate of HOM from the pre-intervention
rate (

hypothesis of a reduction in the rate of growth in HOM dur-
ing the intervention period implies (

The summation term in Equation 1 is a deterministic sea-
sonal component to control for the monthly seasonal varia-
tion in HOM. The seasonal component consists of 11 binary
(0-1) seasonal dummy variables D

(with monthly index
j = 1, 2, ,11,
 and January denoted by j = 1; Granger &

distributed, serially uncorrelated normal error with mean 0
and variance 2.
Table 1 summarizes the ordinary least squares (OLS)
regression results for Equation 1. The estimated model
includes a significant, positive pre-intervention trend for
HOM. Consistent with the predicted reduction in growth rate
during the intervention period, the estimated regression
coefficient for the trend shift variable DT (see Table 1) is
negative and highly significant. Although we have a direc-
tional hypothesis, to be conservative, two-tailed tests are used
for all estimated intervention coefficients reported in Tables 1
and 2. Relative to the pre-intervention trend, the estimated
trend shift after December 2006 implies a cumulative reduc-
tion of 3.5035 in the expected value of HOM over the
Figure 1. Plots of monthly homicide rate (HOM) and size of the TM-Sidhi participants group (GROUP).
Note. In panel (a), the plot of HOM for Nov. 2002 to Dec. 2010 displays strong monthly seasonality, a relatively flat pre-intervention trend, and a shift to
a declining trend in the intervention period starting January 2007 (shown by the vertical line in the plot). Panel (b) shows the plot of the monthly average
daily size of the TM-Sidhi group. The group size rose rapidly beginning in July 2006 until in January 2007 it rose for the first time above the theoretically
predicted critical threshold of 1,725, 1% of the U.S. population at that time. The average size of the group is 587 participants for the 50 pre-intervention
months and 1,792 for the 48 months of the intervention period. HOM = homicide rate. GROUP = size of the group of TM-Sidhi program participants.

2007-2010 intervention period.3 This is a reduction of 21.24%
compared with the mean pre-intervention rate of 16.6714 (an
annual decline of 5.31% during the intervention period). The
cumulative reduction in homicode per 100 million population
translates to a total expected reduction of 8,157 homicides for
the intervention period. Thus, the estimated change in trend
for U.S. homicides has the predicted negative sign and is both
statistically and practically significant.
Regression diagnostics for HOM analysis. Diagnostic tests for
adequacy of the estimated model are summarized in Table 1.
The Breusch­Godfrey Lagrange multiplier (LM) test for
serial correlation of the regression residuals (Godfrey, 1978)
indicates that the null hypothesis of no serial correlation at
lags 1-12 is just significant at the 10% level.4 Individual
autocorrelations at lags 6 (.298) and 10 (.208) are small but
significantly different from 0 at the 5% level. To correct for
this modest serial correlation of residuals, Table 1 reports t
ratios calculated using standard errors that are valid (consis-
tent) in the presence of residual autocorrelation and het-
eroscedasticity of possibly unknown form (Newey & West,
1987).5
Although some mild autocorrelation is present, the resid-
uals from the estimated model approximate a white noise
series and are clearly stationary. This suggests that HOM is
broken-trend stationary (broken TS), exhibiting covariance
stationary (or weakly stationary) fluctuations around a bro-
ken trend. A time series is said to be covariance stationary if
its mean, variance, and auto correlations (or, equivalently, its
auto covariances) are invariant with respect to a change in
time origin (Enders, 2010).
Stationarity of the regression residuals is required for
valid statistical inferences regarding the estimated regression
parameters in the intervention model (Banerjee, Dolado,
Galbraith, & Hendry, 1993; Enders, 2010; Granger &
Newbold, 1974). Broken TS for HOM implies that the OLS
regression estimates in Table 1 have standard distributions
and thus the observed significant change in trend is unlikely
to be the result of the "spurious regression" phenomenon
(Banerjee et al., 1993; Granger & Newbold, 1974). Such
spurious regressions can result when time trends are fitted to
nonstationary variables that contain a random walk compo-
nent ("stochastic trend"). A key signature of spurious regres-
sions is highly autocorrelated, nonstationary regression
residuals. The latter violate the distributional assumptions
underlying statistical inference for time series regression.
Table 1 also reports a formal test for broken TS (Perron,
1989, 2006).6 The Perron test rejects the null hypothesis (p <
.01) that the HOM time series is a nonstationary random
walk with drift (Perron, 1989; Zivot & Andrews, 1992).7 The
alternative hypothesis is that HOM displays stationary fluc-
tuations around a linear trend with a known, one-time break
in the trend function in December 2006.8 The test allows for
a possible gradual adjustment of the trend to its new value in
the intervention period ("innovations outlier" type model;
Perron 1989, 2006; Zivot & Andrews, 1992).9
The Perron test assumes that the time of the structural
break is known (exogenous; Perron, 1989). The results of the
test may be misleading if the date of the break is unknown
and must be determined from the data (Christiano, 1992;
Zivot & Andrews, 1992). The assumption of an exogenous
structural break is appropriate for the current intervention
study because the date of the hypothesized trend break for
the violent crime measures examined in this article was

Other diagnostic tests for model adequacy are also satis-
factory. The null hypothesis that the regression errors have
stable variance (homoscedastic), or if heteroscedasticity is
present, it is unrelated to the explanatory variables, is not
rejected by White's general test (White, 1980). The RESET
test (regression specification test) does not reject the null
hypothesis that the functional form of the regression equa-
tion is correctly specified (Ramsey, 1969). The null hypoth-
esis that the regression residuals are drawn from a normal
distribution is not rejected using the omnibus Doornik­
Hansen test (Doornik & Hansen, 2008; Doornik & Hendry,
2013). No regression residuals exceed 3.5 standard errors,
indicating the absence of extreme outliers. Finally, the null
hypothesis of no autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic-
ity (ARCH) of the model residuals (Engle, 1982) also is not
rejected by the LM test for ARCH. In sum, the diagnostic
tests for model adequacy support statistical conclusion valid-
ity for the statistical inferences reported in Table 1.
Study 2--Urban VCR
Dependent Variable
The dependent variable for Study 2 is monthly rate of violent
crime, reported by the FBI Uniform Crime Report system as
comprising murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible
rape, aggravated assault, and robbery. In addition, murder
together with non-negligent manslaughter was analyzed sep-
arately as the most serious and precisely measured of the vio-
lent crime categories and for comparison with the CDC
homicide data (details available from authors). Monthly data
suitable for time series analysis are not published for the
United States as a whole by the FBI, but the FBI Multimedia
Productions Group provided computer files of Return A
Master Files, containing all Uniform Crime Report data for
each month of a given year for each city or other geographi-
cal unit and the population estimate for that city. These files
were used for each year from 2001 to 2010, and the monthly
violent crime totals were extracted for each city with more
than 100,000 population for which uninterrupted data were
available. The annual population figure for each city was
used to derive monthly population estimates for that city by
linear interpolation (the listed annual estimate was taken as
the April figure, because this listed figure coincided with the
official U.S. Census Bureau count published as an April fig-
ure for census years). The 206 cities, with a combined popu-
lation of 60.17 million in 2010, were located in 37 states and
the District of Columbia.
The data of all 206 cities with more than 100,000 popula-
tion in 2009 for which an uninterrupted monthly time series
was available in the FBI data from 2001 to 2010 were com-
bined into one time series separately for VCR in the follow-
ing manner. (The calculation for MUR was done in a parallel
way using only the data for murder and non-negligent man-
slaughter per 100 million population). For each month, the
total incidence of violent crime (murder, forcible rape, aggra-
vated assault, and robbery) for the 206 cities was divided by
the summed monthly population estimate of the 206 cities,
multiplied by one million (i.e., rate per one million popula-
tion), and divided by the number of days in the month. Thus,
the monthly figure represents the daily rate of violent crime
for that month per one million population in the 206 cities.
The different population ratios used in this study for violent
crime (per one million) and in Study 1 for homicide (per 100
million) were used such that the resulting rates would be of
the same order of magnitude.
Results
Plot of monthly VCR.The plot of VCR in Figure 2 displays
strong monthly seasonality as well as a flat pre-intervention
trend. In the intervention period, VCR shifts to a declining
trend.
Regression results forVCR. To test the hypothesis of a decrease
in the trend growth rate for VCR during the intervention
period, we estimate the following broken-trend intervention
model:

In this case, lag 1 of VCR
t
is required to model its autore-
gressive dynamics, and all other terms are defined as in
Equation 1.
Table 2 summarizes the OLS regression results for
Equation 2. The pre-intervention growth rate for VCR does
not differ significantly from 0. Consistent with theoretical
prediction, the change in trend following the onset of the
intervention is negative and highly significant.
The estimated coefficient for the change in trend DT
t
in
Table 2 gives the immediate impact of the intervention. The
first-order autoregressive dynamics of VCR
t
implies a grad-
ual adjustment of the trend to its new value in the interven-
tion period. If (1 - 
3
)  0, it can be shown that the total
change in trend is given by  = (
2
- 
1
) / (1 - 
3
) = -0.08665
(t = -6.14, p < .001), where  is the coefficient on DT
t
in the
steady state, or static long-run, equation for VCR (Hendry,
1995).10 Here, "long run" denotes the steady state expected
value and does not necessarily imply a long period of time
(Hendry, 1995). The estimated cumulative lag weights for
Equation 2 indicate that 90.4% of the intervention adjust-
ment in trend is completed in 4 months.

differentiation using a nonlinear algorithm (Bårdsen, 1989;
Doornik & Hendry, 2013). Inder (1993) showed that t tests
Dillbeck and Cavanaugh 9
for  based on critical values from the standard normal distri-
bution have good statistical properties (size and power).
Relative to the pre-intervention trend, the estimated shift
in trend during the intervention period implies a cumulative
reduction of 4.1594 in the expected value of VCR over the
2007-2010 intervention period.11 This is a reduction of
18.54% compared with the mean pre-intervention rate of
22.4280 (an annual decrease of 4.64%). In the 206 urban
areas, the cumulative reduction in the daily rate of violent
crime per million population translates to a total expected
reduction of 186,774 crimes for 2007-2010. Thus, the esti-
mated shift in trend for urban violent crime has the predicted
negative sign and is both statistically and practically
significant.
Regression diagnostics forVCR. Each of the diagnostic tests for
adequacy of the estimated model is satisfactory. No regres-
sion residuals exceed 3.5 standard errors, indicating the
absence of extreme outliers. Both LM tests for autocorrela-
tion of residuals are not significant, and no individual auto-
correlations at lags 1 to 24 are significant at the 5% level.
That the residuals appear to be serially uncorrelated, station-
ary white noise, lends empirical support to the conclusion
that VCR is likely broken TS. This conclusion is further sup-
ported by the Perron test reported in Table 2, which rejects
the null hypothesis of nonstationarity at the 2.5% level.12
Murder rate--Secondary analysis.As noted above, we also
analyzed data on the rate of FBI-reported murder and non-
negligent manslaughter (MUR) in the subsample of 206 cit-
ies. Due to space limitations, only summary results are listed
here; more detailed results are available from the authors.
Using an intervention model for MUR having the same
form as given by Equation 1 for HOM, the regression results
include a nonsignificant pre-intervention trend and a signifi-
cant shift to a declining trend in the intervention period (p <
.001). The Perron test rejects nonstationarity at the 1% level,
and all other diagnostic tests for the MUR model are also
satisfactory.
The estimated trend shift implies a 28.40% total reduction
(3,865 murders) for the 2007-2010 intervention period, or
7.10% annually, relative to the pre-intervention trend. For
these 206 urban areas, whose pre-intervention murder rates
were substantially higher than the national average, the esti-
mated annual decline in the murder rate during 2007-2010 is
2.4 times greater than that for HOM in the United States as a
whole and 1.34 times as great when the percentage changes
are compared.
Discussion
For each of the three measures of violent crime examined in
this study, the intervention analysis based on time series
regression rejects the null hypothesis of no effect of the quasi-
experimental intervention on the trend rates of change during
the intervention period 2007-2010. Statistically and practi-
cally significant reductions in the trend rate of growth are
found in each case, with the shift in trend occurring, as pre-
dicted, with the onset of the quasi-experimental intervention
in January 2007. A battery of diagnostic tests indicates satis-
faction of the key statistical assumptions of the analysis, thus
supporting statistical conclusion validity. The statistical
results from the broken-trend intervention modeling of

outcomes for this prospective quasi-experiment, thus, are
consistent with the hypothesis that the group practice of the
TM-Sidhi program may have contributed to decreased rates
of homicide in the United States as a whole as well as violent
crime and murder in a subsample of 206 larger U.S. cities
during 2007-2010.
Of course, rejection of the null hypothesis of no interven-
tion effect on violent crime trends does not necessarily imply
that the alternative hypothesis is true, namely, that the
observed reduction in violent crime trends is attributable to
the TM-Sidhi group practice. Common to all intervention
analyses of quasi-experiments, a limitation of the study is the
threat internal validity posed by potential omitted variables
(Cook & Campbell, 1979; Shadish et al., 2002). Thus, a first
major consideration is alternative hypotheses.
For example, one might consider the very significant eco-
nomic changes of the late 2000s, for which increased unem-
ployment is a primary indicator, as an alternative hypothesis
for the observed national decline in homicide and violent
crime. However, although the relationship of unemployment
and crime is complex (Rosenfeld & Messner, 2013),
increased unemployment is generally associated with
increased crime, especially in the longer term (Aaltonen,
MacDonald, Martikainen, & Kivivuori, 2013; Cantor &
Land, 1985; Chiricos, 1987); therefore, the sharp increase in
unemployment during the intervention period does not
explain the measured decreases in HOM and VCR over the
years 2007-2010. Moreover, the significant increase in U.S.
unemployment began in 2008, a year later than the observed
effects of the study began to be measured. Also, as pointed
out by Richard Rosenfeld, past president of the American
Society of Criminology, the recession of December 2007 to
June 2009 was the first time rates of violent crime failed to
rise during a substantial U.S. economic downturn since
World War II (Eng, 2012).
Incarceration rates are understood to be negatively corre-
lated with rates of crime (Marvell & Moody, 1994), but
prison admissions and prison releases converged from 2006
to 2009, slowing the growth of the U.S. prison population,
and in 2010, prison releases exceeded prison admissions for
the first time for which records are available (Guerino,
Harrison, & Sabol, 2011; Sabol & West, 2011). This would
predict increased rather than decreased violent crime. Also,
the proportion of youth aged 18 to 25 positively correlated
with higher homicide or violent crime (Nivette, 2011) was
increasing through the 2000s (Howden & Meyer, 2011) and,
thus, would not predict reduced rates of homicide or violent
crime. Recent attention has been given to the role of tem-
perature on interpersonal violence (Hsiang, Burke, & Miguel,
2013), with an estimated 4% increase in violence for one
standard deviation of warmer temperature; but again, any
recent trend to warmer temperature would not predict a
resulting decrease in violence, and the seasonal variations in
violence associated with annual cycles of temperature are
modeled by the seasonal parameters of the analyses per-
formed here.
Figure 2. Plot of monthly VCR.
Note. The plot of VCR for Nov. 2002 to Dec. 2010 displays strong monthly seasonal variation, a relatively flat overall trend in the pre-intervention period,
and beginning with the onset of the intervention period in January 2007 (see vertical line in the plot), a shift to a declining trend that continues through
the end of the sample in December 2010. VCR = violent crime rate.
Dillbeck and Cavanaugh 11
More effective policing strategies may also contribute to
reduced rates of homicide and violent crime in some cities;
however, cities around the United States would have had to
implement more effective policing strategies almost simulta-
neously in 2007 to explain the observed effects. Increased
use of surveillance technology may have a deterrent effect,
particularly on property crime, but violent crime and homi-
cide, to which impulsiveness and alcohol use contribute sig-
nificantly (Roizen, 1997), may be more resistant to these
type of deterrence effects; again, a nearly simultaneous
implementation in cities around the United States is also
required to serve as an alternative explanation of the mea-
sured effects.
In addition to the apparent lack of compelling alternative
explanations for the empirically observed effects, additional
support for the conclusion that the independent variable may
possibly have contributed to the observed decline in rates of
both homicide and violent crime is that the findings of this
article further replicate those of 12 previous studies of this
effect published in eight peer-reviewed articles. These arti-
cles report statistically significant reductions in crime or vio-
lence and were reviewed above with a citation of alternative
demographic or environmental factors influencing crime for
which each study controlled or examined. The studies
reported in the current article are part of a more comprehen-
sive empirical evaluation by the current authors (in prepara-
tion) of the impact of this prospective quasi-experiment on
U.S. quality-of-life measures, using the same methodology
as this article.
Methodological issues aside, what is the most effective
way to conceptualize this extended effect apparently associ-
ated with a small group? That is, if the effect is non-spurious,
how to explain the far-reaching influence?
Turning first to the founder of the program, both macro-
level connections and a deeper connection between individu-
als are proposed to contribute to this effect. Each level of
society (family, community, city, state, nation, world) is pos-
ited to have a corresponding collective consciousness that
results from the combined quality of consciousness of all the
individuals in the society (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1977).
The quality of that collective consciousness--for example,
stressed, violent, peaceful--in turn is an input to the experi-
ence of all the component individuals through the general
quality of the atmosphere and the myriad social interactions
through which that quality is expressed. The group practice
of the TM-Sidhi program is predicted to alleviate stress in the
collective consciousness, thereby reducing stress and vio-
lence in individual behavior.
In addition to this macro-social reciprocal influence
between individual and society, the Vedic tradition describes
the character of pure consciousness (experienced during the
Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi program) ulti-
mately as a universal substrate fundamental to the conscious-
ness of each individual (e.g., Radhakrishnan, 1968) and that
the beneficial effects of that experience are thus shared to
some degree by others (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1986). This
non-behavioral influence on others is proposed to interact
with the levels of collective consciousness of society such
that an influence would measurably affect the largest social
unit of which the group is a part, if the size of the group
exceeds a threshold (1%, as noted earlier) for the popula-
tion of that social unit. If the size of the group substantially
exceeds the predicted required amount for a societal unit
(e.g., nation), then previous research has presumed a proxim-
ity effect for nearby nations, assuming the size of the group
is sufficient for the total population of the countries. One
might ask whether proximity should enter into consideration
at all if pure consciousness is described as a universal sub-
strate of consciousness. The most salient evidence related to
that consideration is that the predicted group size required to
create a measurable global influence is the 1% of the
world's population (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1986) that was
approached or exceeded on occasions of some weeks in the
1980s (when the required size was about 7,000), with mea-
surable time series results on international conflict and inter-
national terrorism (Orme-Johnson et al., 2003). For the
world's present population, the group size predicted to be
required is about 8,500. One way to view the predicted
nonlocal influence is that the hypothesized substrate prop-
erty of pure consciousness is a field property, perhaps at
more unified levels of natural law (Hagelin, 1987), although
an inverse square law for diffusion of a force over distance is
not posited, as indicated above in the context of levels of
society.
Are there more familiar concepts of consciousness and
social interaction that can account for the empirical findings
of the present and related studies? One immediate hypothesis
could be the high level of interconnectedness within and
between societies that has emerged in the past two decades,
expressed in social media and seen in the more instant com-
munication of events nationally and internationally. Thus,
perhaps the influence of a group of individuals experiencing
greater peace in their personal lives could be amplified and
spread through their interactions online. Similarly, the
"extended mind" hypothesis, that cognition should be con-
ceptualized as including the environmental elements of the
person­environment interaction, gains broader extension
through current social interaction technology; new properties
emerge from the person­environment interaction as indi-
cated by a dynamical systems analysis even in the minimal
case using robotic artificial nervous systems (Froese,
Gershenson, & Rosenblueth, 2013).
There are two points of evidence suggesting that a com-
munication technology explanation for the current results is
not likely to be the case, one based on previous studies and
one specific to this study. Previous research on this phenom-
enon, particularly in studies from the early 1980s to early
1990s, has found similar effects from an equivalent group of
TM-Sidhi participants (1% of the social unit), even though
many of these studies predated wide access to the Internet,
12 SAGE Open
and in some cases, predating the widespread use of personal
computers (Dillbeck, 1990; Dillbeck et al., 1987; Hatchard et
al., 1996; Orme-Johnson et al., 1988). The relevant evidence
from the current study is that the group was increased to the
size predicted to influence the whole U.S. population by a
private grant supporting a subgroup of participants --young
trained experts from India who had little interaction with the
U.S. social environment. This subgroup averaged 27% of the
total group in 2007 and grew from 41% to 50% in 2008-
2010. The organizers for this group reported that the majority
of these guests did not speak English (Hindi was their mother
tongue) and to physically and culturally care for their wel-
fare, separate campus facilities were provided which hap-
pened to have very little Internet access, although they had
mobile phones to speak with their families in India. Thus,
they had little interaction with the U.S. population through
communication technology.
However, more broadly, research in dynamical systems is
an alternative approach that could be relevant to the phenom-
enon of this study. The presumed nonlinear effect of the
groups of TM-Sidhi participants and associated presence of
threshold effects in social systems of different sizes might
suggest the property of a self-organized critical system (Bak
& Paczuski, 1995; Kron & Grund, 2009) or a scale-free net-
work (Barabási & Bonabeau, 2003). In the present study, we
did not see evidence that the dependent variables were other
than stochastic processes (as expected in a time series of this
length), but it might be possible to design research within a
dynamical systems framework.
Independent of these theoretical considerations, this
research and the studies that preceded it could potentially
have important practical considerations for crime preven-
tion. So far, this research has relied solely on private well
wishers to implement such preventive groups and study their
effects. But, because such groups are centralized rather than
diffused and do not require behavioral interference with the
larger population, governments are in an effective position to
establish and evaluate interventions using this procedure.

Notes
1. Transcendental Meditation® and TM-Sidhi® are service
marks registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,
used by Maharishi Foundation U.S.A. under sublicense.
2. From late July to late October 2006, a second group was
formed in Washington, D.C., to add to the effect of daily group
practice of the TM-Sidhi program. Because the two groups
were separate and distant, the predicted effect of these two
groups was added independently, that is, n n
1
2
2
2
+ , where n
1
refers to the Iowa group and n
2
to the Washington group. The
Washington group was much smaller than the Iowa group, so
the effect was inconsequential for the total number for those 3
months, although it was included for the sake of completeness.
3. Moving down the trend line for the intervention period, the
change in slope (-7.37572 × 10-2) gives the estimated reduc-
tion in the expected value of the daily homicide rate (HOM;
per 100 million population) for each month of the interven-
tion period relative to the pre-intervention trend. Multiplying
the latter by 48 months gives the cumulative change for 2007-
2010: -3.5403 homicides daily per 100 million population.
Relative to the pre-intervention mean rate of 16.6714, this is
a reduction of 21.236%. The estimate of total U.S. homicides
averted for 2007-2010 (8157.46) is given by summing the esti-
mates for each of the 48 months. These estimates are given by
multiplying the cumulative change in rate relative to pre-inter-
vention trend for each successive month times the number of
days in each month and 3.08745538, the U.S. population from
the April 2010 Census population estimate divided by 100.
4. As recommended for smaller samples by Kiviet (1986) and
Harvey (1990), all LM tests in Tables 1 and 2 are reported in
their F statistic rather than chi-square form.
5. The bandwidth of four Newey­West lags (Newey & West,
1987) was selected automatically by PcGive 14 soft-
ware (Doornik & Hendry, 2013) using the integer part of
4 × (T / 100)2/9 (Jurgen A. Doornik, personal communication,
November 5, 2014).
 6. Perron (2006, 1989) reported that standard tests for stationarity
("unit root tests")--such as the augmented Dickey­Fuller test
(Said & Dickey, 1984), Phillips­Perron test (Phillips & Perron,
1988), and others--will generally fail to reject the null hypoth-
esis of nonstationarity when applied to a time series that is bro-
ken TS. Monte Carlo simulation experiments indicate that in
this case, such tests suffer from low power and thus are biased
in favor of concluding that a time series is nonstationary (Lee,
Huang, & Shin,1997; Montañés & Reyes, 1998, 2000; Perron,
1989, 1994). A similar bias in favor of finding nonstationarity
has also been shown to apply to tests with a null hypothesis of
stationarity (Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, & Shin, 1992).

 7. Following Zivot and Andrews (1992), we test for nonstation-
arity using the "change in growth" broken-trend model based
on Equation 15 in Perron (1989, p. 1381), which is model B
in Zivot and Andrews (1992, p. 253). The test statistic has
a nonstandard distribution tabulated by Perron (1989, Table
V.B). The critical value for the test depends on the parameter
 = t
B
/ T, the time of the break divided by total sample size.
For the outcome variables analyzed in this article,  = 0.51,
with the nearest tabled value being  = 0.5.
 8. Because of the monthly seasonality displayed by HOM, a maxi-
mum of 12 lags of first-differenced HOM were considered for
inclusion in the regression used to calculate the test statistic for
the Perron test. Because the inclusion of superfluous regressors
inflates standard errors for the estimated regression coefficients
(Greene, 2011), lags that were not significant at the 20% level
(lags 1-3 and 12), were deleted from the Perron-test regression,
thus, substantially increasing the power of the Perron test.
 9. On the basis of Monte Carlo experiments, Montañés, Olloqui,
and Calvo (2005) recommended using the minimum value of
the Bayesian information criterion (BIC; Schwarz, 1978) to
select the form of the structural-break model used in the Perron
test. For each of the three crime variables analyzed in this article,
estimation of an alternative, more general, model for the Perron
test, Perron's model C (1989, Equation 14), which allows both
a post-intervention change in trend and a change in level of the
series, yields a higher BIC than that for Perron's Equation 15
(Perron, 1989). Thus, the BIC favors the simpler model.
10. Omitting the seasonal coefficients to save space, the estimated
steady state equation is given by E(VCR
t
) = 19.834 - 0.00183t
- 0.0866DT
t
, with respective parameter standard errors 0.753,
0.0076, and 0.0141.
11. The change in slope (-0.0866537) gives the estimated reduc-
tion in the expected value of the daily violent crime rate (per
million population) for each month of the intervention period
relative to the pre-intervention trend. Multiplying by 48 months
gives the cumulative change for 2007-2010: -4.1593776 daily
violent crimes per million population. Relative to the pre-inter-
vention mean rate of 22.4280, this is a reduction of 18.54%.
The expected value of the total 2007-2010 reduction in violent
crime for the 60.17 million population of the 206 urban areas
(186,774.23) is obtained by summing the estimated crimes
averted for each of the 48 months. These estimates are given
by multiplying the cumulative change in rate relative to pre-
intervention trend for each successive month times the number
of days in each month and 60.17.
12. As in the case of the Perron test for HOM, lags 1 to 12 of first-
differenced VCR that were not significant at the 20% level
(lags 1-4 and 6) were deleted from the regression equation
for the Perron test, reducing standard errors for the remaining
regressors and increasing the power of the Perron test.
