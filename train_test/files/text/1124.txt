Objectives: Population-level data on prevalence and distribution of
human papillomavirus (HPV) types in the United States are necessary
to guide optimal vaccination strategies.
Study: Urine specimens from 3262 women ages 18 to 25 in the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Wave III) were
tested and typed for HPV. Poststratification sampling weights gener-
ated nationally representative estimates.
Results: Overall HPV prevalence was 26.9% and as high as 14.3%
among women with 1 lifetime partner but did not vary by geographic
region. High-risk types were detected in 20%; 10% were infected
with types in current candidate vaccines. HPV infection was indepen-
dently associated with mixing sex with alcohol, a black partner, >3
lifetime sex partners, being single, and illegal drug use. Having a
current sex partner and receptive oral sex were inversely associated
with HPV.
Conclusion: HPV prevalence was high throughout the country,
even among women with only 1 lifetime partner, suggesting early and
widespread rather than targeted immunization of young women.
OVER 50% OF SEXUALLY active adults in the United States
acquire 1 or more of the 35 types of human papillomavirus (HPV)
that infect the genital tract at least once in their lifetimes.1 Invasive
cervical cancer, which is almost exclusively associated with per-
sistent infection with 1 or more "high-risk" HPV types, ranks
among the top 10 causes of cancer mortality for women in the
United States and, with breast cancer, is among the top 2 causes
globally.2 HPV-16 and -18 have most commonly been associated
with cancer of the cervix, but numerous other high-risk types also
are considered oncogenic (types 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58,
59, 68, 73, 82). Types 26, 53, and 66 have recently been classified
as probable high-risk types,3 and additional high- and low-risk
types continue to be identified. These oncogenic HPV types are
also associated with cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis, and anus.
Types 6 and 11 are low-risk types and most frequently associated
with genital warts.
Recent trials of an HPV-16 viruslike particle (VLP) vaccine, a
bivalent HPV 16/18 vaccine, and a quadrivalent HPV 6/11/16/18
vaccine in young adult women have shown high levels of protec-
tion against persistent infection with HPV 6, 11, 16, and/or 18 and
against genital warts and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia associ-
ated with these types.4­6 Phase III clinical trials with multivalent
HPV vaccines are now under way, and an effective vaccine will
likely soon be available. Developing strategies for using such a
vaccine requires empirical data on the population prevalence of
HPV infection and the distribution of types.
Although numerous studies of HPV infection in the United
States have been performed, virtually all have been conducted in
subsets of the general population. Among young college women,
HPV prevalence has ranged from 20% to 46%,7­9 and in clinic-
based populations, prevalence as high as 64% has been reported.10
Risk factors for HPV infection identified through these studies
include young age,8,11­15 number of sex partners,8,10­16 combin-
ing sex with alcohol,8 and partner and partnership characteris-
tics.8,10,14,15,17,18 However, college and clinic populations represent
a select segment of society, and there are questions about the
generalizeability of these findings. Clearly, prevalence of sexually
transmitted infections (STI) differs between general population
and clinic samples, yet studies of STI other than HPV demonstrate
that risk factors identified in clinic-based populations are largely
confirmed in general population samples. However, the use of a
clinic-based study population overcontrols for factors associated
with clinic-specific care-seeking behaviors, and such studies may
fail to identify the full spectrum of risk factors associated with any
given infection.19 The sole investigations of HPV in the U.S.
general population to date estimated the prevalence of serum
antibodies to a single type, HPV-16.20,21 In preparation for an

Cancer conducted a multicenter study to estimate population prev-
alence of HPV infection in several different countries17,18, 22­25;
however, the United States was not included. Thus, to generate
population prevalence estimates of HPV in sexually active females
ages 18 to 25 in the United States, determine the prevalences and
distribution of HPV types, and identify sociobehavioral correlates
of infection in the general population, we tested young women
participating in Wave III of the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health (Add Health) for HPV infection.
Materials and Methods
Add Health Study Design and Sample
The Add Health Study was designed to explore health-related
behaviors of adolescents in grades 7 through 12 and health
outcomes in young adulthood, focusing on social contextual in-
fluences.26 This nationally representative probability-based survey
used a stratified, random sample of all high schools and junior high
"feeder" schools in the United States to identify participants and
selected approximately 90,000 adolescents to participate in Wave
I (1994). An in-home subsample was drawn (a core sample from
each community plus selected special oversamples of specific
schools, racial/ethnic groups, disabled students, and siblings) for a
more detailed questionnaire (N  20,745). In 1996, Wave II
consisted of a similar in-home interview. Wave III enrolled sub-
jects from July 2001 to April 2002. All Wave I in-home respon-
dents who could be located received a home visit and provided
informed consent for the survey and STI testing. Participants (N 
15,197) completed a computer-assisted survey interview (CASI),
collecting extensive data on demographic, social, and behavioral
characteristics, and provided a urine specimen. Because the urine
assay is for research purposes only and HPV testing was per-
formed on anonymized specimens up to 1 year after data were
collected, participants were not informed of HPV test results.
Nonetheless, all women receiving other STI test results were
advised to have a Papanicolaou smear. Although less sensitive for
HPV detection than cervical swab specimens (average ratio of
HPV prevalence in cervical:urine specimens is 1.23), urine spec-
imens are deemed appropriate for population-based epidemiologic
studies where cervical swabs that necessitate a clinical examina-
tion cannot be obtained.27,28,30
Selection of the Subsample for HPV Testing
Our subsample was designed to provide 80% power to detect
prevalence ratios of approximately 2.0 for selected risk factors. To
assure at least 3500 sexually active (defined as ever having en-
gaged in vaginal intercourse) women for HPV analyses, 7000
females in the Wave III sampling frame were flagged for recruit-
ment for HPV testing. Flagged specimens received by the Univer-
sity of North Carolina laboratory were aliquoted into 5-ml tubes,
frozen at 70°C, and shipped to the University of Washington
HPV Laboratory on dry ice. A total of 6283 samples were re-
ceived, from which we selected only sexually active women (N 
3741). Of these, 156 (4.2%) had insufficient DNA for HPV testing,
and 102 (3.7%) were not part of the originally flagged group; these
were excluded. Seventeen subjects over 25 years of age and 204
women without complete data to calculate sampling weights were
also excluded from further analyses, leaving a total of 3262 subjects.
Laboratory Testing
The urine specimen was thawed, aliquoted, and spun, and the
resulting cell pellet resuspended in 600 l STM (storage and
transfer media from Digene Corporation) and digested with 20
g/ml protease K. DNA was isolated using QIAamp blood DNA
minicolumn, following the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen Cor-
poration, cat. No. 51,104). HPV positivity was determined first by
PCR amplification using HPV L1 consensus primers MY09/
MY11/HMB01 and -globin primers PC04/GH20, and then fol-
lowed by dot blot hybridization with generic HPV and -globin
probes.29 Specimens negative for -globin DNA were excluded
from further analyses. HPV positive samples were typed using
probes to detect types 6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 45,
51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73, 82, 83, 84 using the
Roche Diagnostics line blot assay (Gravitt, 1998). Study proce-
dures were approved by institutional review boards at the University
of North Carolina (parent Add Health Study) and the University of
Washington (for HPV testing).
Statistical Analyses
We performed a stratified, weighted analysis, taking into ac-
count Add Health's cluster sampling design to generate nationally
representative estimates. Analyses incorporated the school as the
primary sampling unit, region of the United States as the stratifi-
cation variable, and poststratification sampling weights. These
poststratification sampling weights were specially designed for the
HPV subsample and account for the sampling design and survey
nonresponse, as well as the quota-sampling method used to flag
persons for HPV testing. In univariate analyses, we used a design-
based Pearson's chi-square test for comparisons of categorical
characteristics to evaluate factors hypothesized to be associated
with HPV. Univariate and multivariate prevalence ratios (PR) and
95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using weighted
Poisson regression in Stata version 8.0 (StataCorp LP, College
Station, TX). Variables tested for inclusion in the multivariate
model were those that (a) had been previously associated with
HPV in other studies, or (b) were significantly associated with
HPV at P  0.10 in our univariate analyses, using manual forward
selection. Variables were retained in the multivariate model if they
were significantly associated with HPV infection as determined by
a P value 0.05, using a 2-tailed Wald-based test. Potential
confounding factors were identified a priori from variables asso-
ciated with HPV infection (e.g., age, previous treatment for HPV
related disease, smoking) and were retained in the multivariate
model if their inclusion changed any of the coefficients by 10% or
more.
Results
Characteristics of the Add Health HPV Subsample
The women selected for the HPV subsample did not differ
significantly from all sexually active women participating in Wave
III with respect to age, race/ethnicity, region, education, income,
number of sex partners, age at first sexual intercourse, or frequency
of vaginal intercourse (P 0.05 for all, data not shown). Women
in the HPV subsample had a mean age of 21.7 years (95% CI,
19.65­23.83); 68.8% were white, but oversampling provided sub-
stantial numbers of blacks (17.1%) and Hispanics (10.9%). More
respondents were from the Midwest (34.0%) and South (37.7%),
than from the West (15.5%) and Northeast (12.8%); 53% had
attained at least 1 year of college, 50% reported $10,000 annual
personal income, and 74% had never been married. We detected
Mycoplasma genitalium in 1.0% of urine specimens using a PCR
assay (L. Manhart, In press), and Miller et al.30,31 detected Chla-
mydia trachomatis in 4.2%, Trichomonas vaginalis in 2.3%, and
Neisseria gonorrhoeae in 0.4%.

Prevalence of HPV Infection
Urine specimens from 934 women contained detectable HPV
DNA, for a weighted HPV prevalence of 26.9% (95% CI, 23.65%­
30.07%) (Table 1). Age-specific prevalence was approximately
30% in women aged 18 to 21 years, and declined with age.
Race-specific HPV prevalence was highest among African and
Native Americans and lowest among Asians. HPV prevalence was
highest in the South (30%; 95% CI, 26.75­33.90) and lowest in the
Midwest (24%; 95% CI, 19.76­28.09).
HPV Types
We identified 36 different HPV types, and multiple types were
found in approximately 62% of HPV-positive women (16% of all
women). A total of 1985 different combinations of HPV types
(including 57 untypeable HPV-positive specimens) were identified
in the 934 HPV-positive women. HPV 16 was the most commonly
identified type (5.8%; Fig. 1), followed in frequency by types 84
(3.2%), 51 (3.0%), 62 (3.0%), 54 (2.9%), and 53 (2.8%). High-risk
types were found in 20.4% of Add Health women, with 9.9%
infected exclusively with a high-risk type and 10.5% coinfected
with both high- and low-risk types; low-risk types alone were
present in only 4.8%. Nearly 10% of women with only 1 lifetime
vaginal sex partner were infected with a high-risk HPV type. HPV
types 6 or 11, primarily responsible for external genital warts, were
detected in 2.2% of all women, while types 16 or 18 or both were
present in 7.8% of women. Only 0.3% of women were infected
with both HPV 16 and 18, and no woman was concurrently
infected with HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. Types 16 or 18 comprised
38% of all infections with a high-risk type. The distribution of
HPV types did not differ significantly by geographic region.
Characteristics Associated With HPV Infection
Compared to women without HPV infection, women with in-
fection tended to be younger, single, black, younger at sexual
debut, and had more sex partners (lifetime and in the past year)
(Table 2). Even among women with only 1 vaginal sex partner
ever, 14% (95% CI, 11.14%­18.18%) were infected with HPV.
HPV prevalence was lower among women who were currently
involved with their most recent partner, and that partnership was
characterized by shorter duration, shorter time between meeting
and initiating sexual activity, less oral and anal sex, and more often
involved a black partner. There was no difference in HPV posi-
tivity by region, educational level, annual personal income, or
having signed a virginity pledge; yet among those who pledged,
HPV-positive women did so at a younger mean age than HPV-
negative women (14.4 versus 15.6 years, P  0.02). Although
women with HPV had more often used a condom or experienced
condom failure in the past 12 months, correct and consistent
condom use was not significantly associated with HPV infection
(PR 0.9; 95% CI, 0.70­1.16).
HPV prevalence was higher among women with an STI diag-
nosis in the past year, genital warts, and/or who believed they had
gonococcal or chlamydial infection at the time of the survey. HPV
infection was also associated with other high-risk behaviors such
as smoking, substance use (marijuana, "crystal meth," other illegal
drugs), sex while drinking or using drugs, or exposure to violence
in the past 12 months as measured by dealing in stolen goods or
threatening encounters involving guns or knives (data not shown).
Results from our weighted multivariate Poisson regression
model adjusting for age, colposcopy in the past year, and each of
the other factors in the model indicated that the prevalence of HPV
infection was higher among young women and women with a
recent male sex partner who was black (Table 3). Of note, the
woman's own race/ethnicity was no longer associated with HPV
infection when her partner's race/ethnicity was considered. Nu-
merous characteristics represented exposure to high-risk partners,
but only the report of engaging in an unwanted sexual situation
after drinking and of illegal drug use in the past 12 months
emerged as independently associated with genital HPV infection.
A high lifetime number of sex partners (more than 3 versus 3 or
less) and having never married were also positively associated
with HPV infection. The 2 factors that were negatively associated
with HPV infection were current involvement with and receipt of

between being black and having concurrent sex partners or select-
ing a black partner or between marital status and number of
partners.
Additional analyses were done using weighted multinomial lo-
gistic regression analysis to simultaneously assess factors associ-
ated with high- and low-risk HPV types but did not demonstrate
clear differences in risk factors between high- and low-risk types
and thus are not presented.
Discussion
These are the first population-level data on HPV prevalence in
the United States. The prevalence of HPV in urine from sexually
active women in Add Health was 26.9%, an order of magnitude
higher than the prevalence of N gonorrhoeae, C trachomatis, T
vaginalis, or M genitalium. Fourteen percent of women who re-
ported only 1 vaginal sex partner in their lifetime had genital HPV
infection. HPV-16 was the most common type, and oncogenic
types were detected in 20% of women. Although certain demo-
graphic characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity, marital status) were
predictive of prevalent HPV infection, other socioeconomic char-
acteristics were not (e.g., education, income), nor were preventive
behaviors, such as signing an abstinence pledge or correct and
consistent condom use. Although it is tempting to speculate that
race/ethnicity-specific HPV prevalence predicts cervical cancer
rates, the correlation is poor. For example, Native American
women had the highest prevalence of HPV (37.1%), yet they have
the lowest rates of cervical cancer (4.9 per 100,000).32 The absence
of a relationship between HPV prevalence in young women and
cancer rates is partially because cervical cancer occurs primarily in
older women, and Papanicolaou testing, diagnosis, and treatment
options today versus 20 to 40 years ago have changed over time
and across racial ethnic groups.
Although the use of easily obtained specimens such as urine allows
us to obtain genital tract specimens in household surveys, urine-based
assays for HPV have somewhat lower sensitivities than assays of
cervicovaginal specimens. In spiking experiments, spiked untreated
urine was a millionfold less sensitive than spiked untreated water,
likely due to inhibition of the PCR reaction.33 In a comparative study
of adolescents, the ratio of cervical HPV prevalence to urine HPV
prevalence was 1.2 (90% versus 75%).28 Similarly, Forslund and
colleagues27 reported a ratio of 1.3 (49% cervical versus 38% urine)
in women attending a colposcopy clinic, and Strauss et al.34 observed
a ratio of 1.2 (78% versus 65%) in women attending a genitourinary
medicine clinic, resulting in an average ratio of HPV prevalence in
cervical:urine specimens of 1.23. To more closely approximate the
cervical prevalence of HPV (assuming 100% specificity of the tests),
we could inflate our observed prevalence in urine of 26.9% by 1.23,
giving a prevalence estimate of 33.1%. However, urine specimens
likely represent a mix of cervical and vulvar or vaginal HPV infec-
tions, so one cannot assume all infections detected in the urine were
cervical.
Among HPV-infected women, the 6 most commonly identified
types were 16, 84, 51, 62, 53, and 54. Although previous HPV
prevalence studies also place type 16 within the 5 most common
types7­10,13,17,18,22­24,35­37, only 4 of 13 identified type 51 among
the top 5,8,9,23,35 and only 1 identified types 54 and 62 among the

top 5 types detected.13 Some differences in the prevalence of types
may be attributable to improving methods for PCR-based detection
of HPV DNA over the past decade. Furthermore, the assay we
used incorporated probes for most of the recently identified HPV
types (including types 84 and 62). However, some differences may
also be due to our use of urine-based detection, as previous studies
have demonstrated that different HPV types are identified in paired
cervical and urine specimens.28,34 The specific type distributions
that we observed thus may be somewhat different from what
would be observed in cervical swab specimens, with possibly a
lower relative prevalence of low-risk than high-risk types.34
Some of the independent risk factors for HPV infection we
identified were consistent with previous reports, whereas others
were unique. Unlike other studies,8,11­15 age was not indepen-
dently associated with detection of HPV in these women, possibly
explained by the limited age range in Add Health or adjustment for
the behaviors that put younger women at higher risk. In addition to
younger age, the most consistent predictors of HPV infection have
been lifetime number of sex partners10­13,15,16 or number of part-
ners within the past year,8,13,14 factors also independently associ-
ated with HPV infection in our analyses. Our finding of increased
risk of HPV among women who reported involvement in a sexual
situation while drinking is similar to Ho and colleagues'8 finding.
Other studies have identified partner or partnership characteristics
as risk factors, such as partners' other sex partners,8,15,17,18 not
living together,14 partner age,10 and partner's education.8 We also

after sex or between periods in the past 24 hours, antibiotic use, depression, BMI, religiosity, father was ever jailed, and hormonal contraceptive
use, age difference, race different from partner's race, type of partnership for most recent partnership, education difference, hormonal
contraception at most recent sex, and frequency of vaginal sex with most recent partner.

assessed these characteristics but only found current involvement
with the most recent sex partner and having a black partner
associated with HPV infection. The strong effect of partner's race
has been observed for other bacterial STI and likely reflects higher
prevalence of HPV among young black males. Current infection
with other STIs did not remain significantly associated with HPV
infection after adjustment for behaviors common to all STI.
The lack of an observed association with condom use is con-
sistent with other cross-sectional assessments of this relationship38
and may be due to measurement error, social desirability bias,
and/or inability to accurately capture temporal sequence in a
sexually experienced population assessed at a single point in time,
rather than a true absence of effect. A recent longitudinal study of
newly sexually active young women demonstrated a 70% reduc-
tion in HPV incidence among those reporting consistent condom
use, using electronic diary data,39 suggesting that condom use may
indeed be effective in preventing initial acquisition of HPV. The
absence of effect for abstinence pledges has been previously
reported,40 and is also not surprising since all women tested for
HPV were sexually active.
The decreased risk associated with receptive oral sex was unex-
pected and warrants interpretation with caution. Although this ob-
served effect may be explained by residual confounding, in separate
analyses adjusting for frequency of vaginal sex, number of vaginal sex
partners, and partnership characteristics, the estimate remained un-
changed, suggesting that the effect of engaging in oral sex may be
independent of the number of times the individual was exposed to an
infected partner. Further studies are required.
A major strength of this study is the large sample size and
sampling scheme of Add Health, which provides the first nation-
ally representative estimates of HPV prevalence in the United
States. Nevertheless, results should not be extrapolated to women
outside the sample age range. A limitation is the fact that urine-
based PCR assays for HPV are somewhat less sensitive than PCR
performed on cervical swab specimens; thus, true prevalence may
be closer to 33% than the 26.9% that we detected.
In conclusion, prevalences of infection with genital HPV, in-
cluding oncogenic types, were high throughout the country, even
among women with only 1 lifetime vaginal sex partner, and as
early as age 18. Anticipating the advent of prophylactic HPV
vaccines many suggest routinely vaccinating girls before they
become sexually active,41 yet others oppose such a strategy on the
grounds that it would encourage promiscuity. However, there is no
evidence to suggest this is true. Given the relatively high HPV
prevalence in young women with low-risk sexual behaviors and
the absence of a practical set of factors to define a high-risk group,
these data suggest that widespread rather than targeted immuniza-
tion of young women will provide a greater public health benefit
against this ubiquitous infection. The association of sex partner
characteristics with HPV infection suggests that vaccinating boys
should also be seriously considered.
