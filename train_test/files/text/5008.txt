Abstract
Objective: To explore working memory and the ability to process different emotional stimuli in
patients with first-onset and untreated minor (mild or moderate) depression.
Methods: Patients with first-onset and previously untreated minor depression, and healthy
controls, were enrolled. Using a modified Sternberg working memory paradigm to investigate the
combined effects of emotional stimuli with working memory, participants were exposed to
experimental stimuli comprising pictures that represented positive, neutral and negative emotions.
Working memory ability was measured using reaction time and accuracy, and emotion-processing
ability was measured using pupil diameter.
Results: Out of 36 participants (18 patients with minor depression and 18 controls), there were
no statistically significant between-group differences in response time and accuracy. Positive stimuli
evoked changes in pupil diameter that were significantly smaller in patients with minor depression
versus controls, but changes in pupil diameter evoked by negative stimuli were not significantly
different between the two groups.
Conclusions: Healthy subjects showed a stronger emotional response to positive emotional
stimuli than patients with first onset and previously untreated minor depression, but there were no
differences in response to negative emotions. There were no statistically significant between-group
differences in terms of speed of cognitive response, but this may have been due to the relatively
small samples sizes assessed. Studies with larger sample populations are required to further
investigate these results.

Introduction
Patients with depression are thought to
insufficiently process positive information
and excessively process negative informa-
tion,1 tending to ignore happy emotional
stimuli while preferentially processing nega-
tive emotional stimuli.2­4 In addition, a
study in non-clinical populations demon-
strated that depression diminishes the cap-
ability of imagining future positive
outcomes and strengthens the ability to
imagine negative outcomes.5 Patients with
affective disorders also present cognitive
dysfunction in areas such as working
memory, attention and learning.6­11
Cognitive dysfunction in depression is
primarily characterized by executive dys-
function resulting from frontal lobe damage,
and memory disorders resulting from tem-
poral lobe damage.12 Depression has been
shown to significantly impair attention and
word memory,13 however, although patients
with depression are shown to have impaired
free recall, their cued recall and recognition
are comparable to those of healthy individ-
uals.14 A study using the Sternberg working
memory paradigm15 found that capacity for
working memory was decreased in patients
with untreated major depressive disorder.16
Using a verbal version of the n-back task,17
compared with healthy individuals, patients
with major depressive disorder exhibited
reduced accuracy and slower reaction times
on 1-, 2-, and 3-back tasks, however, there
was no significant between-group difference
at the baseline 0-back level.18 Patients with
major depressive disorder were also shown
to be significantly impaired in terms of
performance (accuracy and reaction time)
on a 2-back task, compared with healthy
individuals.19 Using a symbol n-back
experimental paradigm, individuals with
major depressive disorder were demon-
strated to have significant memory impair-
ments and exhibit lower accuracy versus
healthy controls on 0-, 1-, and 2-back task
levels, but not on a baseline 3-back level.20
The same study also found that patients'
reaction times were significantly longer at all
levels versus healthy controls.20 Brain struc-
ture research into emotion and working
memory focuses on the amygdala in the
medial temporal lobe (the key brain struc-
ture for emotional memory, representing the
core of the entire emotional memory neural
network), and the hippocampus (which rep-
resents memory organization).21 The amyg-
dala and hippocampus work together via
two independent systems when dealing with
emotion and memory,22 however, in patients
with depression, cognitive dysfunction and
resulting memory impairment, this collab-
oration is difficult to identify.
Many findings from studies into working
memory remain inconsistent, possibly due to
differing experimental paradigms and
materials, however, all have demonstrated
that working memory is impaired in patients
with depression. Most cognitive impairment
research has focused on patients with mild
or moderate depressive symptoms, with little
research regarding first-onset and untreated
depressive disorder. In patients with depres-
sion, cognitive dysfunction, such as reduced
working memory, is thought to occur
because of cognitive control impairment.23
The prefrontal lobe and anterior cingulate
(including ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) comprise
the centre of cognitive control and executive
function.24 In healthy individuals, activation
of the prefrontal cortex leads to reduced
activity in the negative emotion processing
530 Journal of International Medical Research 44(3)
regions, such as the amygdala,25 suggesting
that this cognitive control region has a
regulatory role in processing negative emo-
tions. Patients with depression who com-
pleted a colour-word Stroop task,26 which
requires cognitive control, were shown to
have a greater probability of error and
significantly decreased event-related poten-
tial N2 and N450 amplitudes compared with
healthy controls, and these changes
occurred in the left dorsolateral prefrontal
and dorsal anterior cingulate regions.27 In a
digital sorting task that required cognitive
control, patients with depression exhibited
significantly decreased dorsolateral pre-
frontal cortex activity compared with
healthy controls, suggesting that brain dis-
orders related to cognitive control functions
in patients with depression result in a failure
to effectively adjust and control emotional
processing regions.28 Patients with depres-
sion, who were directed to successively
complete two independent tasks,29 showed
excessive activation of the emotion process-
ing brain regions during an emotion pro-
cessing task versus healthy controls, whereas
during a digital scheduling task, cognitive
control brain regions were insufficiently
activated. When emotion processing was
combined with task performance in an
experimental paradigm,30 brain regions
involved in emotional processing were
revealed to be excessively activated in
patients with depression, whereas cognitive
control brain regions were insufficiently
activated. Cognitive control and emotional
processing brain regions are thought to
control and regulate each other,31 and
major depressive disorder is often accom-
panied by working memory deficits caused
by competition for resources generated
between emotional and cognitive process-
ing. Decreased cognitive control ability
leads to inadequate distribution of cognitive
and attention resources for cognitive tasks.32
Despite a large number of studies into
emotional damage and working memory in
depression, several deficiencies exist: most
studies focus on major depressive disorder,
with few studies into first-onset and
untreated depressive disorder (mild/moder-
ate depressive symptoms); the majority of
studies examine emotional processing and
working memory issues as separate elem-
ents, rather than in combination; previous
studies have focused on the working
memory system (executive function, execu-
tive function templates, and voice and visual
space templates), with less attention to the
memory function system (memory encoding
and retrieval); and research has focused on
emotional processing functions, with limited
studies investigating processing capacity for
external emotional stimuli.
Research into working memory suggests
that patients with major depressive disorder,
whose work and daily life has been affected,
do not have complete damage to working
memory function.14,18,20 Based on the dif-
ferent manifestations of work, studies and
lives of patients with non-severe versus
severe depression, the present authors
hypothesized that working memory is par-
tially and mildly damaged in patients with
non-severe depression. Some studies suggest
that cognitive dysfunction does not improve
with remission of depression,6,33­36 which
infers that there would be no relationship
between cognitive impairment and depres-
sion severity.36­39 In addition, patients with
major depression show impairments in cog-
nitive control and executive func-
tions,6,7,29,33,40 and this decreased ability to
process information should affect cognition
ability and behaviour. Patients with depres-
sion tend to insufficiently process positive
information but excessively process negative
information,1 therefore, the present authors
hypothesized that the performance of emo-
tionally impaired patients with first-onset
and untreated depressive disorder is char-
acterized by a reduced capacity for external
positive-emotion processing and excessive
capacity for negative-emotion processing.

In the present study, patients with first-
onset and previously untreated minor
depression were compared with healthy
subjects, using a modified Sternberg work-
ing memory paradigm15,41 that combined
emotional stimuli with working memory to
investigate emotional experience and work-
ing memory abilities. Working-memory
ability was measured using reaction time
and accuracy, and emotion-processing
ability was measured by changes in pupil
diameter, as mental activities associated
with emotions can lead to changes in pupil
size.42,43
Patients and methods
Study population
This prospective case-control study sequen-
tially recruited patients with first-onset and
previously untreated depressive disorder
(minor depression group) attending the out-
patient clinic at Beijing Anding Hospital,
Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.
Sex-, age- and education-matched healthy
subjects were recruited from the local popu-
lation in Beijing via advertisements, and the
study was conducted between December
2013 and March 2015. Patients with depres-
sion were screened by a psychiatrist (LF
and BbF) using the Mini International
Neuropsychiatric Interview44 and diagnosed
according to the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth
Edition (DSM-IV) criteria.45
Inclusion criteria for patients with minor
depression were as follows: (1) aged 16­60
years and right-handed; (2) met the DSM-IV
diagnostic criteria for depression and diag-
nosed with mild or moderate depression;
(3) scored < 24 on the 17-item Hamilton
Depression Rating Scale (HDRS),46 which
was used to assess the degree of depression;
(4) were undergoing treatment for the first
time and had no history of taking anti-
depressants or drugs that affected nervous
system function prior to treatment; (5) had
no suicidal tendencies and could work, study
and live normally; and (6) had normal or
corrected-to-normal vision with no colour
blindness or other eye disease, and could
complete the eye movement experiment.
Exclusion criteria included concomitant
delirium, dementia and other cognitive dis-
orders, and substance misuse. Inclusion
criteria for the healthy controls were as
follows: (1) aged 16­60 years and right-
handed; (2) scored < 5 on a self-assessment
based on the quick inventory of depressive
symptomatology-self report (QIDS-SR16
)47
and <4 on the Beck Depression Inventory;48
(3) had no history of mental illness; and (4)
had normal or corrected-to-normal vision
with no colour blindness or other eye
disease.
This study was approved by the Ethics
committee of Beijing Anding Hospital,
Capital Medical University, China. All par-
ticipants provided written informed consent,
and received compensation for their
participation.
Experimental materials
Sixty pictures were selected from the
International Affective Picture System49
based on the level of valence and arousal.
Positive pictures were selected to have high
valence and high arousal levels (mean
valence level 7.31 Æ 0.44, mean arousal
level 5.54 Æ 0.44), and negative pictures
had low valence and high arousal (mean
valence level 2.79 Æ 0.51, mean arousal level
5.97 Æ 0.44). Neutral pictures were images of
daily necessities, such as life and work
scenes, buildings, transportation, and geom-
etry figures that did not easily induce emo-
tion (mean valence level 5.18 Æ 0.17, mean
arousal level 3.23 Æ 0.22). All of the pictures
were processed using Adobe Photoshop
software, version 6.0 (Adobe Systems
Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA); and the
size (7.94 Â 7.94 cm), grey scale and reso-
lution were consistent between the pictures.

Experimental paradigm and procedure
The present study applied a modified
Sternberg working memory paradigm,15,41
and substituted three types of pictures (to
stimulate positive, neutral and negative
emotions) for the string of numbers conven-
tionally used as cues. To sufficiently induce
the participants' emotions, each cue
included four pictures of the same type of
emotional category, which were presented to
the subjects once. The experiment included
three types of cue: positive, negative and
neutral emotion pictures. The target stimu-
lus was a picture, and participants were
asked to determine whether the target pic-
ture had appeared in the cue.
The experimental procedure followed
several steps. First, a `þ' sign appeared at
the center of a 17-inch liquid crystal display
screen (1024 Â 768 resolution) for 0.5 s to
indicate that the stimulus pictures would
appear. The cue was presented for 10 s, and
participants were instructed to carefully
watch the pictures and remember them.
After 5 s for memory retention, a target
picture appeared on the screen, and partici-
pants were asked to determine whether it
had appeared in the cue. If it had appeared
in the cue, participants were instructed to
click the left button; otherwise, they clicked
the right button. Finally, a `*' symbol
appeared on the screen, indicating that the
participants should rest for 2 s. After this
time, the next trial began.
The experimental equipment comprised a
corneal reflection eye tracker (Tobii T120
Eye Tracker; Tobii Technology, Danderyd,
Sweden), with a sampling frequency of
120 Hz. The experimental materials were
displayed on the liquid crystal display
screen using a Microsoft IE6.0 browser
(Microsoft Corporation, Seattle, USA),
and the distance between the display screen
and participants was 60 cm. As the cue was
presented, the Tobii T120 eye tracker rec-
orded pupil diameter at each fixation point
as participants viewed the pictures, and
reaction time and accuracy as participants
responded throughout the task. Participants
were required to keep their heads still, and
there were no other physical constraints.
To study the brain's ability to process
positive and negative emotional stimuli,
differences in pupil diameter changes
evoked by positive and negative emotional
pictures were analysed in patients with
minor depression and control groups using
the following calculations:
Assuming that there were m fixations in
task j of participant i, the pupil diameter size
of the k (k ¼ 1, 2,. . ., m) fixation point Fijk
is
PTijk
in participant i, which was calculated
from the following equation
PTijk
¼ Leftijk
þ Rightijk
À Á
=2 ð1Þ
where Leftijk
is the left pupil diameter of the
fixation and Rightijk
is the right pupil diam-
eter of the fixation. Thus, the mean pupil
diameter in task j for participant i was as
follows:
PTij
¼
X
m
k¼1
PTijk
=m ð2Þ
Assuming the PSi
is the change in pupil
diameter evoked by the r positive emotional
picture stimuli of participant i based on
equation (1) and equation (2), the pupil
diameter change for the l negative emotional
picture stimuli, PNi
, would then be calcu-
lated by the following two equations:
PSi ¼ PSir À PRi ð3Þ
PNi ¼ PSil À PRi ð4Þ
where the PRi
is the mean pupil diameter of
participant i evoked by all of the neutral
emotion picture stimuli.
Statistical analyses
Data are presented as mean Æ SD, and stat-
istical analyses were conducted using SPSS
Li et al. 533
software, version 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL,
USA). Reaction time and accuracy were
analysed based on emotional category (posi-
tive, neutral or negative). Pupil diameter
changes (difference in pupil diameter
between emotional and emotion-neutral
states) were analysed based on type of
emotion (positive or negative). A mixed-
model analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 2
(group: minor depression, healthy con-
trols) Â 3 (within-subject factor stimulus
material: positive, neutral, negative)
repeated measures was conducted to analyse
accuracy and reaction time. Using a two-
sample t-test, between-group differences in
pupil diameter changes were compared. In
addition, a Bayesian analysis was con-
ducted,50 and Pearson's correlation coeffi-
cient was used to assess pupil diameter
changes that correlated with accuracy and
reaction time.
To correct for outliers, trials for which
reaction times were either > 3 SD from each
participant's mean (calculated separately for
each trial type) or <400 ms were excluded
(a standard procedure used to trim reaction-
time data), which removed approximately
1.25% of the trials. The resulting means for
the corrected trials were used in the present
analyses. A P-value < 0.05 was considered
to be statistically significant.
Results
Demographic and clinical data
A total of 18 patients with first-onset and
previously untreated minor depressive dis-
orders and 18 healthy controls were
included, and the two groups were matched
by sex, age and education. In the minor
depression group (8 male and 10 female
patients), mean age was 34.28 Æ 10.12 years,
mean number of years in education was
13.61 Æ 3.52, mean HDRS score was
16.06 Æ 4.35, and mean QIDS-SR16
score
was 16.56 Æ 3.35. In the healthy controls
(9 male and 9 female participants), mean age
was 33.56 Æ 8.48 years, mean number of
years in education was 14.50 Æ 3.45, and
mean QIDS-SR16
score was 2.50 Æ 1.58.
Between-group comparisons of working
memory reaction time
Reaction times for positive, neutral and
negative pictures between the minor depres-
sion and healthy control groups are shown
in Figure 1. A mixed-model ANOVA with 2
(group: minor depression, healthy con-
trols) Â 3 (emotional category: positive, neu-
tral, negative) repeated measures analysis of
reaction time revealed that there was no
statistically significant overall effect of emo-
tional category (F [2, 33] ¼ 0.231; P ¼ 0.601),
and no significant interaction effect
(F [2, 33] ¼ 0.598, P ¼ 0.451). There was
also no statistically significant overall effect
in terms of group (F [1, 34] ¼ 3.571,
P ¼ 0.067). A follow-up independent t-test
(positive, t [34] ¼ 1.965, P ¼ 0.058; neutral,
t [34] ¼ 1.009, P ¼ 0.320; and negative,
t [34] ¼ 1.903, P ¼ 0.066] also showed that

there was no statistically significant differ-
ence in terms of response time between
healthy controls and patients with minor
depression.
Between-group comparisons of
working memory accuracy for
different emotion categories
To address whether any difference in reac-
tion time between the two study groups
could be due to insufficient encoding, main-
taining and/or retrieval the difference in
between-group accuracy was assessed.
Between group comparisons of accuracy in
the positive, neutral and negative emotion
categories are shown in Figure 2. A mixed-
model ANOVA with 2 (group: minor
depression, healthy controls) Â 3 (emotional
category: positive, neutral, negative)
repeated measures analysis of accuracy
showed that there was no statistically sig-
nificant overall effect of emotional category
(F [2, 33] ¼ 1.411, P ¼ 0.212), no significant
interaction effect (F [2, 33] ¼ 1.204,
P ¼ 0.213), and no significant overall effect
in terms of group (F [1, 34] ¼ 2.700,
P ¼ 0.101), indicating that there were no
between-group differences in working
memory task performance.
Change in pupil diameter
Analysis of pupil diameter in response to
neutral stimuli showed that mean pupil
diameter in the minor depression group
was 3.71 Æ .56 mm, and in the healthy con-
trols was 3.81 Æ .45 mm, with no statistic-
ally significant between-group difference
(t [34] ¼ À0.518, P ¼ 0.609).
Using a mixed-model ANOVA to
compare mean change in pupil diameter
induced by positive and negative emotion
pictures (Figure 3), revealed a statistically
significant difference in overall effect of pupil
diameter change between the groups (F [1,
34] ¼ 13.254, P < 0.005). An independent-
samples t-test showed that there were statis-
tically significant between-group differences

positive emotion (t [34] ¼ 4.823, P < 0.000, P
Bayes [H0
] ¼ 0.002, Bayes Factor ¼ 621.18),
and these changes were significantly higher
in the healthy controls. There were no stat-
istically significant between-group differ-
ences in change of pupil diameter induced
by negative emotion (t [34] ¼ 0.686,
P ¼ 0.497, P Bayes (H0
) ¼ 0.721, Bayes
Factor ¼ 2.59).
Relationship between change in pupil
diameter and working memory accuracy/
reaction time
Pearson's correlation coefficient analyses to
explore whether changes in pupil diameter
were associated with working memory reac-
tion time and accuracy (Table 1), revealed
that in patients with minor depression,
change in pupil diameter evoked by positive
emotional stimuli was correlated with
memory accuracy regarding positive infor-
mation (r ¼ 0.448, P ¼ 0.048), whereas
change in pupil diameter evoked by negative
emotional stimuli was not significantly cor-
related with memory accuracy regarding
negative information (P ¼ 0.062). No other
statistically significant correlations were
observed.
Discussion
Reaction time and accuracy are thought to
be behavioural indicators of working
memory damage in patients with major
depressive disorders.16,18 In the present
study, overall working memory capacity
(reaction time and accuracy) of patients
with minor depression was not significantly
different from healthy controls, suggesting
that working memory function (including
encoding, maintaining and retrieval) in
patients with minor depression may not be
impaired. These results were inconsistent
with the authors' hypothesis that working
memory is partially and mildly damaged in
patients with non-severe depression, but
were consistent with a study that found
patients with major depressive disorder had
a normal capacity for cued recall and rec-
ognition.14 The present study showed that
mean reaction times in patients with minor
depression were not significantly different
from healthy controls, however, this lack of
statistical significance may have been due to
the small sample size investigated. The pre-
sent results suggest that information pro-
cessing in general may not be slower in
patients with minor depression versus
healthy individuals, however, further inves-
tigation with a larger sample size is required
to confirm this.
Expansion and narrowing of pupil diam-
eter has been shown to reflect emotional
changes in humans.42,43 Positive pictorial
stimuli, containing happy emotional
information, will cause a happy emotional
experience, resulting in increased pupil
diameters. Negative pictorial stimuli, con-
taining sad or frightening emotional infor-
mation, will evoke unpleasant emotional
experiences, resulting in decreased pupil
diameters. Different emotional experiences
are the result of different emotional

processing activities in the brain and the
direct reactions to those activities. The pre-
sent study found that when patients with
minor depression viewed positive pictures,
changes in pupil diameter were significantly
smaller than those of healthy individuals,
but there was no such between-group differ-
ence when participants viewed negative pic-
tures. These results suggest that patients
with minor depression have limitations in
processing information from external posi-
tive visual stimuli, which may result in an
insufficient ability to experience pleasurable
emotions. Patients with minor depression
did not present limitations in processing
information from external negative visual
stimuli, however, suggesting that the nega-
tive emotional experience did not differ from
healthy individuals in the present study. This
finding partially concurred with the authors'
hypothesis that patients with first-onset,
untreated depression have a reduced capa-
city for external positive-emotion processing
and excessive capacity for negative-emotion
processing. Two factors may explain this
partial agreement: First, the present research
included patients with first-onset and previ-
ously untreated mild or moderate depressive
symptoms; and secondly, changes in pupil
diameter during an emotional experience
were calculated using the participants' pupil
diameters during their own emotional
experiences minus their pupil diameters in
a neutral emotional state, which reflected the
results of processing external emotional
stimuli (the inherent unconscious negative
automatic processing of patients with
depression was excluded). For healthy indi-
viduals, pupil diameter size during an emo-
tional state is the result of external
emotional stimulation,42,43 and pupil diam-
eter size during a neutral experience reflects
the normal pupil diameter.51 In patients
with depression, pupil diameter during the
emotional state is the summation of pupil
diameter caused by external emotional
stimulation and pupil changes caused by
internal negative emotion processing.51
Pupil size during the neutral state is the
summation of pupil diameter during normal
behaviour and pupil changes caused by
internal unconscious negative automatic
processing. Thus, from the view of cognitive
subtraction, regardless of healthy control or
depression group, changes in pupil diameter
can only reflect the processing of external
emotional stimulation.
In patients with depression, imaging
studies have shown that negative emotion-
processing brain regions are enhanced, with
excessive processing of negative emotions
compared with healthy controls.52 This
result52 is produced by direct comparisons
between patients with depression and
healthy controls, reflecting the additional
inherent and automatic unconscious nega-
tive emotional processing in patients with
depression, and does not contradict the
conclusions that patients with minor depres-
sion do not tend to handle external negative
visual stimuli excessively. Thus, patients
with depression tend to process external
negative stimuli based on their inherent
automatic processing of negative stimuli,
which strengthens the activities of negative-
processing brain regions in patients with
depression compared with healthy individ-
uals.52 Furthermore, changes in pupil diam-
eter can only reflect the processing of
external negative stimuli and the experience
this evokes. The subjective experience of
patients with severe depression is shown to
be reduced for both positive and negative
emotional stimuli, whereas the subjective
experience of patients with mild depression
is reduced only for positive emotional
stimuli.53 The manifestations of emotional
damage in patients with severe depression
have been shown to indicate a reduced
ability to process positive emotions and
maintain the activity of brain areas, whereas
negative emotional processing and brain
activity maintenance are normal.54 These
studies support the present finding that
Li et al. 537
emotional damage in patients with non-
severe depression results from a lack of
positive emotion processing capacity rather
than excessive negative emotion processing.
Anhedonia, the diminished capacity to
experience pleasure, is related to dysregula-
tion of the brain's reward systems, and
together with sensitivity to pressure, is
thought be an endophenotypic characteristic
for major depression.55 The present study
showed that, although patients with minor
depression and healthy controls did not
differ in terms of negative emotional experi-
ence, patients with minor depression had
a significantly lower positive emotional
experience compared with healthy controls.
This finding suggests that anhedonia is not
only an endophenotypic feature of major
depressive disorders, but also of moderate or
mild depressive disorders: That is, anhedo-
nia may be one of the core symptoms of
depression.
Finally, analysis of the correlation
between degree of emotional experience
and working memory in the present study
showed that change in pupil diameter
evoked by positive stimuli in patients with
minor depression was strongly correlated
with memory accuracy in relation to positive
information. The positive emotional experi-
ence in patients with minor depression was
significantly lower than in healthy controls,
suggesting that the lower the positive emo-
tional experience, the lower the memory
accuracy of positive information. In con-
trast, changes in pupil diameter evoked by
negative stimuli were not significantly cor-
related with memory accuracy relating to
negative information; the lack of signifi-
cance may have been due to the relatively
small sample size investigated. Studies of
mood-congruent memory have suggested
that, compared with healthy controls,
patients with depression remember more
negative stimuli that are consistent with
their depressive mood, and remember less
positive stimuli that are inconsistent with
their mood.56 Increased memory for nega-
tive information with mood-congruency and
decreased memory for positive informa-
tion with mood-inconsistency are basic
manifestations of memory capacity in
patients with depression.57,58 The present
results are consistent with published studies,
and showed that non-major depression also
had a mood-congruent memory effect,
which may indicate that mood-congruent
memory effects are one of the core features
of depression.
The present study has several limitations:
First, comparisons were only made between
patients with first onset and previously
untreated minor depression and healthy
controls, and the present results were indir-
ectly compared with results of previous
findings in patients with major depression,
which may affect the interpretation of the
findings; Secondly, the limited sample size
may have affected the statistical validity. For
example, correlation analyses may not have
resulted in an unbiased estimate of prob-
ability, although the sample size in the
present study was comparable to a similar
published eye-tracking study;59 Thirdly, the
study of cognitive control and executive
function was based on analysis of cognitive
behaviours (reaction time and accuracy)
rather than direct imaging of brain function.
Future research should include a larger
sample size, a comparator group of patients
with severe depression, and provide imaging
evidence, such as functional magnetic res-
onance imaging data.
The present study revealed that first-
onset and previously untreated patients
with mild or moderate depressive symptoms
may have different working memory
responses compared with healthy controls.
In terms of emotional experience, healthy
controls showed a stronger emotional
response to positive emotions than patients
with minor depression, whereas there was no
significant between-group difference for
negative emotions. Consistent with previous
538 Journal of International Medical Research 44(3)
studies of major depressive disorder, first-
onset and previously untreated mild or
moderate depression showed a mood-
congruent memory effect.
