The Forum
Functional limitation has received considerable attention in gerontology and geriatrics.
Much of this work has focused on single-wave transitions devoid of context rather than on
the pattern of transitions over time that constitute trajectories. This Forum article suggests
that it is time for a different way of looking at functional limitation pathways. It focuses on
trajectories. Responses to three Rosow and Breslau (1966) and two Nagi (1976) items, asked
of 12,998 older adults who participated in up to seven waves of data collection as part of
the Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly, are used to illustrate
this approach, emphasizing both its conceptual and pragmatic advantages. The results
provide greater clarity in terms of those who become functionally limited, take on more
functional limitations, or recover as well as those who are likely to be lost to follow-up and
in terms of the outcomes associated with those individuals over time.

Rethinking Functional Limitation Pathways

Functional limitations involve situation-free activi-
ties (Verbrugge & Jette, 1994), or the capacity to per-
form fundamental physical actions such as reaching
out or up, walking a half mile, or climbing a flight of
stairs. In contrast, disabilities involve situation-depen-
dent activities (Verbrugge & Jette, 1994), such as the
capacity to perform basic tasks associated with daily
living like bathing and toileting, or to perform in-
strumental tasks such as money management and
shopping. Taken together, functional limitations and
disabilities are among the most frequently studied is-
sues in gerontology and geriatrics. This can be
readily demonstrated in two ways. One involves re-
viewing the work that has appeared in the journals
published by The Gerontological Society of America
during calendar years 1995­1998. Of the 1,120
Medline entries for The Gerontologist and the Jour-
nals of Gerontology, 145 or one eighth could be
identified simply from the single subject heading
(i.e., MeSH term) for activities of daily living (ADLs).
The other way to demonstrate the interest in func-
tional limitation and disability in gerontology and ge-
riatrics is to review the number of instruments used to
measure these constructs. Cohen and McHorney
(1998) recently identified more than 75 such instru-
ments that have been developed since 1945. Be-
cause their list was restricted to generic (i.e., not dis-
ease specific) functional assessment tools, this is
actually a conservative estimate.
A frequent theme in studies of functional limita-
tion and disability are transitions over time. Indeed,
Stuck and colleagues (1999) recently identified 78
longitudinal studies conducted between 1985 and
1997 that focused on risk factors for such transitions.
Generally speaking, research on transitions in func-
tional limitation and disability may be placed into
three categories. The first category of studies looks at
transitions between one state and another state on
just one item. For example, this could involve the on-
set of a particular disability item, such as bathing.
Given the dichotomous (limited vs not limited) na-
ture of most ADL items, this approach typically in-
volves using a binomial logistic regression model in
which several risk factors are used to predict going
from an independent to a dependent state in terms of
bathing. The second category of studies looks at
changes in categorical dependence levels from one
state based on the basis of several items. An example
of this approach would be the transition from one
The study was funded by Grant R37 AG09692 from the National Insti-
tutes of Health/National Institute on Aging to Dr. Wolinsky. Additional
support was provided by the National Archive for Computerized Data on
Aging during Dr. Wolinsky's term as resident scientist and by a research
assistantship from the Graduate School of Saint Louis University to Mr.
Armbrecht. Preliminary results from this article using the first four waves of
data were previously presented at the 1997 Annual Meeting of The Geron-
tological Society of America, and at the 1998 Workshop on Transitions in
Health Status for Older Persons, which was sponsored by the Italian Na-
tional Research Council. The data were originally collected by James O.
Taylor, Robert B. Wallace, Adrian M. Ostfeld, and Dan G. Blazer, who

versity Consortium for Political and Social Research. The opinions

combinatorial state of ADL and/or instrumental ADL
(IADL) limitations (e.g., having only one IADL limita-
tion and no ADL limitations) to another combinatorial
state (e.g., having any two IADL limitations and/or
any one ADL limitation). Because there are frequently
more than two possible combinatorial states, this ap-
proach often involves multinomial logistic regression
or grade of membership models. The third category of
transition studies looks at change score analyses of
aggregated indices. This approach frequently involves
general linear modeling of changes in the simple
summed number of either ADLs or IADLs.
Although all three of these categories of research
on transitions in functional limitation and disability
have made important contributions to our under-
standing of the onset of and recovery from functional
limitations, at least three important issues remain un-
resolved. First, state transitions involving only one
item (e.g., shopping) examine that transition in isola-
tion from state transitions on other items (e.g., money
management and transportation). This is not entirely
realistic inasmuch as the ability to shop is (or should
be) at least partly conditioned on the ability to main-
tain personal finances and get to stores. Second,
changes in both categorical dependence models and
change score analyses of aggregated indices are
somewhat removed from the original item transitions.
That is, with these approaches it is not known which
of the particular individual states (e.g., ADLs or
IADLs) have been exited or entered. Indeed, compo-
sitional change in the individual states (e.g., going
from bathing and dressing limitations to eating and
toileting limitations) that results in the same combi-
natorial classification (i.e., two ADL limitations) is
conceptually and statistically treated as stability.
Third, all three categories of transition modeling ap-
proaches focus mostly on differences between only
two points in time, such as baseline and a specifi-
cally targeted follow-up. As a result, there is no char-
acterization of the trajectory pattern. This is both
conceptually limiting and empirically unfortunate,
given the increasing number of multiwave data sets
available for analysis.
Even recent and sophisticated analyses suffer from
these limitations. This can be quickly illustrated with
just two examples of some of the best work that has
been done in recent years. First, consider the work of
Rudberg, Parzen, Leonard, and Cassel (1996). Writ-
ing in this journal, they reported on using wave-to-
wave probabilities to examine ADL transitions across
the 1984 baseline and 1986, 1988, and 1990 re-
interviews of the respondents in the Longitudinal
Study of Aging (LSOA). Although Rudberg and col-
leagues focused on seven states (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or
5 limited activities, or death), real transitions within
three of those states (i.e., the 2, 3, or 4 limited activi-
ties states) would mistakenly be viewed as stability if
the transition resulted in the same numerical count.
Second, consider the work of Mendes de Leon and
colleagues (1999). Writing in another of The Geron-
tological Society of America's journals, they reported
using Markov models to estimate one-year disability
transitions in ADLs across eight waves of data from
the Yale Health and Aging Project (one of the four
sites of the Established Populations for the Epidemio-
logic Study of the Elderly, or EPESE). In those analy-
ses, a two-state transition was modeled reflecting en-
trance into one or more of the six ADL disabilities, or
return from one or more of the six ADL disabilities to
no disabilities. As such, that work only reflects the
two most extreme transitions (i.e., the initial onset of
the first disability, or complete recovery).
It would seem, then, that most of the work done to
date on changes in functional limitation and disabil-
ity over time has focused on single transitions devoid
of context rather than on the pattern of transitions
over time that constitute trajectories. The purpose of
this Forum article, therefore, is to suggest reorienting
both conceptual and empirical work toward trajecto-
ries. The essential element underlying our approach
involves a different way of characterizing trajectory
patterns. To illustrate this approach, consider the
data used by Rudberg and colleagues (1996). They
examined five dichotomous ADL items: bathing,
dressing, eating, getting in and out of a bed or chair,
and toileting. These ADLs were observed over the
four waves of the LSOA. Thus, at baseline there were
32 possible combinations (i.e., 25) in their data, as-
suming that there were no missing data at the item
level. Three additional combinations were possible at
each follow-up, reflecting respondents who had died,
who were re-interviewed but did not answer all five
of the ADL items, or who were otherwise lost. To ap-
preciate the myriad possible trajectory patterns, visu-
alize four 6  6 grids on which each of the 32 possi-
ble baseline or 35 possible follow-up combinations
can be located (i.e., one grid per wave of data). Ar-
range the cells on these grids such that at baseline the
most densely populated cells (limitations on none or
only one or two ADLs) are at the outer edges, and the
least densely populated cells (such as death and lost
to follow-up, which are by definition empty at base-
line) are at the center. Layer the grids in a three-dimen-
sional space in which the baseline grid is on top and
the close-out grid is on the bottom, much like a three-
dimensional tic-tac-toe or chess game.
This approach has some intuitive appeal. Consider
the simplistic case in which there was very little limi-
tation at baseline, followed by incrementing disabili-
ties over the three follow-up periods, resulting in insti-
tutionalization or death. Under those circumstances,
a graphical portrayal of the cell densities would re-
semble a tornado pattern, with the intensity (i.e., rate
of progression) of the funneling dependent on how
well the observed longitudinal run corresponds to the
natural pattern of decline. However, regardless of
whether such a tornado pattern (symmetrical or oth-
erwise) emerges, it becomes evident that there is
nearly an infinite number of possible trajectories (i.e.,
approximately 353 or about 40,000). Of these, it will
be the most densely traveled paths that represent the
patterns of interest that should ultimately be modeled
using multivariable methods to identify salient risk
factors.

Rather than use the ADL items in the LSOA as an
empirical example of this perspective, we have cho-
sen five of the lower body functional limitation ques-
tions taken from the Rosow and Breslau (1966) and
Nagi (1976) measures that were included in the
EPESE. There were three reasons for the selection of
these measures and data. First, as Lawrence and Jette
(1996) have eloquently argued, functional limitations
(as opposed to disabilities, or situation-free versus sit-
uation-dependent activities) are what drive the dis-
ablement process from both the theoretical and prac-
tical standpoints. Thus, improvements in the public
health of older adults will be most closely tied to un-
derstanding functional limitation trajectories (Branch,
1996). Second, despite the availability of lower body
functional items in the LSOA, no attempt was made
to re-interview nearly one third of the LSOA respon-
dents in 1986 because of budgetary constraints (Ko-
var, Fitti, & Chyba, 1992). As a result, the utility of
the LSOA for assessing trajectory patterns is substan-
tially diminished (Lawrence & Jette, 1996; Rudberg et
al., 1996). Third, the November 1998 public use ver-
sion of the EPESE available from the Inter-University
Consortium for Political and Social Research in-
cludes the first seven waves of data collected from all
four sites as well as the associated mortality data
(Taylor, Wallace, Ostfeld, & Blazer, 1998). As such,
the EPESE is the largest and longest-run multiwave
data set currently available for public use. Use of
these data expands the number of grids in our dem-
onstration from four to seven, and it concomitantly
increases the number of unique trajectories that are
possible to approximately 1 billion (i.e., about 356).
Methods
The EPESE project was designed to investigate risk
factors for chronic disease and functional loss as well
as to model the risks of mortality, hospitalization, and
nursing home placement (Taylor et al., 1998). Data
were elicited from persons 65 years old and older
who resided in four catchment areas: East Boston,
Massachusetts; New Haven, Connecticut; Iowa and
Washington Counties, Iowa; and north central North
Carolina. Sampling approaches varied by site and in-
volved the following: (a) a total community census in
East Boston; (b) Agency on Aging enumeration lists in
Iowa; (c) residential stratification within private and
public age-restricted housing and general community
areas in New Haven; and (d) area sampling in North
Carolina. Because of the different and complex sam-
pling designs used at each site, traditional estimation
procedures that assume random selection might un-
derestimate standard errors and result in inflated sig-
nificance levels in the absence of adjustments for the
design effects. For the descriptive and illustrative pur-
poses of this Forum article, however, such design ad-
justments are not necessary.
At baseline, the response rates for those eligible
(given the above sampling approaches) were 84%
(n  3,809) in East Boston, 80% (n  3,673) in Iowa,
82% (n  2,812) in New Haven, and 80% (n 
4,162) in North Carolina, yielding a combined sam-
ple of 14,456 older adults. With some exceptions
(206 telephone interviews in Iowa), the baseline in-
terviews were conducted face-to-face in 1982 for
East Boston, Iowa, and New Haven, and in 1986 for
North Carolina. Subsequently, at each site there were
two consecutive cycles of three annual follow-ups in-
volving two rounds of telephone interviews and one
face-to-face interview. Therefore, a total of seven
waves of data are available for use. Because the fo-
cus of this Forum article is on annual changes in
physical limitations, no adjustment is made for the
potential period confound associated with the later
start of the North Carolina data series.
The EPESE included five lower body functional
limitations questions: three items from the Rosow
and Breslau (1966) scale, and two items from the
Nagi (1976) scale. The Rosow and Breslau items
were as follows: (1) "Are you able to do heavy work
around the house like (shoveling snow), washing
windows, walls, or floors without help?" (2) "Are you
able to walk up and down stairs to the second floor
without help?" and (3) "Are you able to walk half a
mile without help?" Response options were "yes" or
"no." "No" responses were coded as limitations. The
Nagi items were as follows: (4) "How much diffi-
culty, if any, do you have pulling or pushing large
objects like a living room chair?" and (5) "What
about stooping, crouching, or kneeling?" Response
options were "no difficulty at all," "a little or some
difficulty," "a lot of difficulty," or "just unable to do
it." The latter two responses were coded as limita-
tions.
One of the three Rosow and Breslow (1966) items
warrants further discussion. This is the heavy house-
work question, which is a noticeably less discreet in-
dicator of lower body limitations. Indeed, the ability
to do heavy housework is the least situationally free
of the five items and, as such, it taps disability in ad-
dition to functional limitation. The complexity of the
heavy housework item notwithstanding, it remains
widely used as an indicator of lower body functional
limitation (Stuck et al., 1999) because the primary ex-
ertional force is derived from the legs, regardless of
which particular housework activity is involved.
Therefore, we retain it in the current analysis. Note
that these measurement shortcomings are minimized
by our focus on patterns of serial combinatorial tran-
sitions rather than traditional marginal change score
models.
Because the Nagi items were not asked of 250
Iowa proxy-respondents or 206 Iowa telephone re-
spondents at baseline, it was necessary to reduce the
eligible analytic sample to 14,000. Frequency distri-
butions for the five lower body physical limitation
questions are shown in Table 1 by wave of data col-
lection. Missing data at baseline reflect item nonre-
sponse. Subsequent missing data reflect both item
nonresponse and loss to follow-up other than mortal-
ity. Mortality data were obtained by carefully moni-
toring hospital admissions, obituaries, state death
indexes, and follow-up interviews with collateral
140 The Gerontologist
persons previously identified by the deceased re-
spondents. Reported deaths were verified by matches
with death certificates in 99.2% of all cases.
In this Forum article, the integrity of the five indi-
vidual questions was maintained. Nonetheless, tradi-
tional psychometric methods were used among the
12,998 EPESE persons with no missing data at base-
line to explore the reliability and validity of a com-
posite based on the simple summation of the five
items. Exploratory factor analyses using both princi-
pal components and principal axis techniques identi-
fied a unidimensional structure with an eigenvalue of
2.9 that accounted for 58.1% of the variance in the
five items. Communalities ranged from .55 to .65 in
the principal components analysis, and from .43 to
.57 in the principal axis analysis. Factor loadings
ranged from .74 to .80 in the principal components
analysis, and from .66 to .77 in the principal axis
analysis. Coefficient alpha was .82. Comparable re-
sults were obtained at all follow-ups.
To simplify reference to the 32 possible combina-
tions among the five items at baseline and the 35
possible combinations at each of the six follow-ups, a
notational system was selected. It labels each combi-
nation of the five items at each wave by using a five-
digit sequence. Ones or zeroes reflect the presence
or absence, respectively, of the limitation in ques-
tion. At all waves, the limitations are sequenced from
left to right in ascending order on the basis of their
prevalence at baseline (i.e., easiest to most difficult to
perform tasks; see Table 1). Therefore, the first num-
ber (i.e., the leftmost 0 or 1) refers to a limitation in
walking up one flight of stairs, the second to a limita-
tion in pushing or pulling large objects, the third to a
limitation in walking one-half mile, the fourth to a
limitation in stooping, and the last to a limitation in
doing heavy housework. For example, the sequence
(or state) 00101 denotes a person whose only limita-
tions are walking one-half mile and doing heavy
housework. The analysis is limited, for simplicity, to
the 12,998 EPESE persons with complete data for all
five items at baseline. Persons lost to follow-up are
assigned a numeric code of 77777. A numeric code
of 88888 is used for persons who were re-inter-
viewed but had missing data on one or more of the
five items. Decedents are noted with the numeric
code of 99999.
Results
As shown in Table 2, the distribution of the 12,998
EPESE analytic sample persons (i.e., those with no
missing data at baseline) across all possible unique
combinations is not uniform. Indeed, only 13 of the
35 possible states each have either 2% (n  260) or
more of the analytic sample persons at baseline (i.e.,
wave 1), the last follow-up (i.e., wave 7), or both.
This includes those with no limitations at all (i.e.,
00000), four of the states with only one limitation
(i.e., 00001, 00010, 00100, and 01000), three of the
states with two limitations (i.e., 00011, 00101, and
01001), three of the states with three limitations (i.e.,

00111, 01011, and 01101), three of the states with
four limitations (i.e., 01111, 10111, and 11101),
those with all five limitations (i.e., 11111), and those
who at wave 7 were lost to follow-up (i.e., 77777),
were re-interviewed but had missing data (i.e.,
88888), or were deceased (i.e., 99999). These 13
most common states accounted for 85.2% (n 
11,074) and 89.9% (n  11,685) of the EPESE ana-
lytic sample at baseline and the last follow-up, re-
spectively. At baseline, 77.3% (8,557/11,074) of
these older adults were in states completely congru-
ent with a hierarchy or Guttman scale (Dunn-Rankin,
1983; Lazaridis, Rudberg, Furner, & Cassel, 1994;
Rosow & Breslau, 1966; Torgerson, 1962) based on
the prevalence data sequence (i.e., 00000, 00001,
00011, 00111, 01111, and 11111). Excluding those
lost to follow-up, having missing data, or deceased,
the percentage was similar at the final follow-up (i.e.,
70.7% or 5,472/7,736).
There are three important points worth noting in
Table 2 with regard to functional limitation path-
ways. First, over the seven waves of data, the greatest
absolute distributional changes involve just two of
the 35 possible states, those with no functional limi-
tations at all (i.e., state 00000) and those who be-
come deceased (i.e., state 99999). At baseline, about
one half of the analytic sample had no functional
limitations and, by definition, none were deceased.
By the final follow-up, however, only one fourth of
the analytic sample had no functional limitations
and, by then, one fourth had died. This is to be ex-
pected inasmuch as the rate of onset of functional
limitations typically exceeds the rate of complete re-
covery from functional limitations (Manton, Corder,
& Stallard, 1993, 1997; Mendes de Leon et al., 1999;
Wolinsky, Stump, Callahan, & Johnson, 1996) due to
the fact that mortality is a fully absorbing state in tran-
sition models (Crimmins, Hayward, & Saito, 1994).

142 The Gerontologist
The second point worth noting in Table 2 con-
cerning functional limitation pathways involves the
30 other states possible at baseline (i.e., excluding
states 77777 and 88888). Being limited only in heavy
housework (i.e., state 00001) or only in stooping (i.e.,
state 00010) are by far the two most densely popu-
lated of these 30 states. Their percentage shares are
reduced by about one half from wave 1 to wave 7.
The absolute numbers of persons in the 28 remaining
states, however, did not change appreciably over the
observation period. This includes those with all five
functional limitations (i.e., state 11111), who repre-
sented 7.4% of the analytic sample at baseline and
7.8% at final follow-up. Thus, from a sequential
cross-sectional standpoint, it would appear plausible
to conclude that considerable distributional stability
existed.
A third important point worth observing in the
data shown in Table 2 involves those who were com-
pletely lost to follow-up at each particular wave of
data collection (i.e., state 77777) and those who
were re-interviewed at each particular wave but had
missing data on one or more of the functional limita-
tions questions (i.e., state 88888). The lost to follow-
up state increases in a three-step fashion, going from
about 3% at waves 2 and 3, to about 5% at waves 4,
5, and 6, to about 8% at the final follow-up. This is
consistent with previous reports that those com-

pletely lost to follow-up at any particular wave of
data collection are at increased risk of staying lost at
subsequent waves and, if simply excluded from lon-
gitudinal analyses, may result in substantial attrition
bias (Dubin & Rivers, 1990; Little & Rubin, 1990; Lit-
tle & Schenker, 1995). At the same time, however, it
is clear that being lost to follow-up is not a fully ab-
sorbing state among older adults (Mihelic & Crim-
mins, 1997). In contrast, the percentage of those who
were re-interviewed at a particular wave but had
missing data on one or more of the functional status
questions (i.e., state 88888) shows a noticeable dip at
waves 5 and 6 but is otherwise relatively stable at
about 5%. Although consistent with an interpretation
that those who have missing data at the functional
limitations item level at any particular wave of data
may be at increased risk of doing so repeatedly over
time, these data are only definitive about the exist-
ence of considerable cross-sequential distributional
stability.
What the data in Table 2 do not provide is much
of a picture of either wave-to-wave transitions or
overall trajectories. One way to do this would be to
draw a flow diagram showing the migration paths
(depicted by arrows) from each state at each wave to
each state at the next wave, with the number of
EPESE sample persons making each transition listed
on each arrow. Even if such a flow diagram were re-
stricted to only the 13 most common states, however,
this would be incredibly complex. There are 130
(i.e., 10 states to 13 states) possible arrows from wave
1 to wave 2, and 157 (i.e., 12 states to 13 states, plus
the single state-to-state transition for those already
deceased) possible arrows for each of the five re-
maining contiguous wave-to-wave transitions, result-
ing in 915 possible arrows overall. A less cumbersome
approach is to present the frequency distributions for
the 13 most common states at waves 1 to 7 for those
persons residing in the most densely populated origin
or destination states. Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 do this
for two origin states and three destination states. The
origin states involve those who had no functional
limitations at baseline (00000) and those who had all
five functional limitations at baseline (11111). These
two origin states account for 57.0% (7,407/12,998)
of the EPESE analytical sample. The three destination
states involve those who had no functional limita-
tions at the last follow-up (00000), those who had
all five functional limitations at the last follow-up
(11111), and those who were deceased at the last fol-
low-up (99999). These three destination states account
for 60.3% (7,837/12,998) of the EPESE analytical
sample.
Table 3 contains the frequency distributions across
all seven waves for the 6,443 EPESE sample persons
who had no functional limitations at baseline. By the
last follow-up, 42.8% of these older adults had no
functional limitations, and another 9.8% had only
one limitation (i.e., state 00001, 00010, or 00100).
Thus, the majority (albeit slim) of these individuals
had maintained a very high level of functional ability
over the 7-year period. Others, however, have done
less well, with 4.4% having developed either four or
five functional limitations by the last follow-up (i.e.,
state 01111 or 11111), 18.1% having died (repre-
senting about a 3% annual mortality rate), and 8.5%
being lost to follow-up. Thus, there is considerable
evidence of the onset of functional limitation and
death, even in this select group of individuals in ro-
bust health at baseline.
The frequency distributions across all seven waves
for the 964 EPESE sample persons who had all five
functional limitations (i.e., state 11111) at baseline
are shown in Table 4. These data reveal a very differ-
ent pattern. Although some recovery did occur, in-
cluding the restoration of all functional abilities, this

was rather rare. Furthermore, although 20% of those
with all five functional limitations at baseline were
not found in one of the 13 most common states at
wave 2, this is merely an artifact. Recall that four of
the states with four functional limitations were so un-
common that they were not included in the table.
Ninety-five of the persons with all five functional lim-
itations at baseline migrated to one of these four less
common states with four functional limitations at
wave 2. However, by the final follow-up, 90.5% of
the 964 older adults who had all five functional limi-
tations at baseline were still limited (24.0%), lost to
follow-up (6.7%), had missing items (4.7%), or were
dead (55.1%, or about a 9% annual mortality rate).
Thus, there is considerable evidence that those with
the most functional limitations at baseline are most
likely to retain those limitations or to die.
Table 5 contains the frequency distributions across
all seven waves for the 3,257 EPESE sample persons
who had no functional limitations at the last follow-
up. Of these individuals, 84.7% were also without
any functional limitations at baseline. Moreover, an-
other 8.6% had only one functional limitation at
baseline (i.e., state 00001, 00010, or 00100). Thus,
the evidence suggests that nearly all of those who were
in robust health at the end of the observation period
were rather hardy when it started. It is also important
to note that about 3-4% of those persons who had no
functional limitations at the last follow-up were ei-
ther lost to follow-up (i.e., state 77777) or had miss-
ing data on one or more items (i.e., state 88888) at
one of the intervening waves, illustrating the poten-
tial attrition bias that can occur by excluding those
with missing data.
The frequency distributions across all seven waves
for the 1,011 EPESE sample persons who had all five
functional limitations at the last follow-up are shown
in Table 6. A very different pattern is revealed here.
Less than one fourth of these individuals had all five
functional limitations at baseline. Moreover, only
about one half had all five functional limitations at
wave 6, suggesting considerable wave-to-wave tran-
sition into this state. This is further reflected by the
fact that 7.3% of those having all five functional limi-
tations at the final follow-up had either none or only
one such limitation the year before (i.e., state 00001,
00010, or 00100 at wave 6). It is also important to
note that only 7.5% of those with all five limitations
at the last follow-up were either lost to follow-up
(i.e., state 77777) the year before or had some miss-
ing data (i.e., state 88888) at that point. This repre-
sents only 5.1% (34/669) and 15.2% (41/270), re-
spectively, of all such EPESE sample persons, suggesting
that few individuals lost to follow-up at a preceding
wave were found to have all five functional limita-
tions at the next wave.
In addition, close inspection of Table 6 reveals
something not found in any of the preceding tables.
Fully 22% (224/1,011) of those who had all five func-
tional limitations at the final follow-up were not to be
found in any of the 13 most common states at the
preceding follow-up (i.e., wave 6). Neither were sim-
ilar percentages to be found in any of the 13 most
common states involving any previous wave-to-wave
transition. When coupled with the above observation
that less than one half of the persons who had all five
functional limitations at the final follow-up were in
that state (i.e., 11111) at wave 6, this indicates an un-
usually large migration into this state from the less
common states that only occurs at wave 7.
Table 7 contains the frequency distributions across
all seven waves for the 3,579 EPESE sample persons
who were deceased at the last follow-up. In addition
to demonstrating that this is a fully absorbing state,

these data show that the majority of those who died
at a given wave either had all five functional limita-
tions in the previous wave or were lost to follow-up.
That is, of the 658 (3,579-2,921) new deaths be-
tween waves 6 and 7, 37.2% (245) had five func-
tional limitations and 18.5% (122) were lost to fol-
low-up. At the same time, 10.3% (68) of the new
deaths between waves 6 and 7 involved persons with
no functional limitations at all, and another 4.3%
(28) involved persons with only one functional limi-
tation. Moreover, nearly one half of those who were
dead by wave 7 had either no limitation or just one
functional limitation at baseline. This reflects the fact
that although there is a dose­response relationship
between functional limitations and mortality, even
those in robust health face sizeable risks.
Discussion
In this Forum article, we have suggested rethinking
functional limitation pathways to focus on trajecto-
ries, by which we mean patterns of serial transitions
in context. Theoretically, doing so has three advan-
tages. First, it directs attention to unique combina-
tions of functional limitation items. Second, it brings
fidelity back to the definition of stability. And third, it
shifts attention from two-state transition models to
patterns in serial transitions.
Pragmatically, rethinking functional limitation path-
ways to focus on trajectories reveals a clearer picture
of what is taking place. Specifically, it provides
greater clarity in terms of who becomes functionally
limited, who takes on more functional limitations,
and who recovers as well as who is likely to be lost to
follow-up, and what happens to those individuals
over time. For example, previous studies have shown
that both the onset of functional limitations and com-
plete recovery occur among older adults, although
the former happens with greater frequency than the
latter (Manton et al., 1993, 1997; Mendes de Leon et
al., 1999; Wolinsky et al., 1996). The trajectories
shown here, however, further indicate that patterns
of decline and recovery (i.e., transitions) are not the
same for all origin states. This is clearly reflected in a
comparison of Tables 4 and 5. Table 4 indicates that
there was very little recovery of any magnitude
among those with all five functional limitations at
baseline, whereas Table 5 indicates that 1 out of 6
older adults who had no functional limitations at the
final follow-up had at least one functional limitation
at baseline. These distinctions are completely masked
in more traditional transition models.
Moreover, as one would expect, it is also the case
that the greatest amount of wave-to-wave fluctuation
occurs among those with two, three, or four func-
tional limitations at baseline (data not shown). Such
oscillation patterns could reflect either of two distinct
possibilities, one positive and one negative. On the
positive side, these fluctuation patterns may accu-
rately reflect the ebb and flow of functional limita-
tions over time for older adults. On the negative side,
it is possible that these oscillations reflect more on
the unreliability of the five functional limitation
items. Either explanation should prompt a reconsid-
eration of more traditional transition models because
those approaches (especially transition models in-
volving only two points in time) infer more meaning
to these observed changes than is probably war-
ranted.
Focusing on trajectories also has implications for
the treatment of those lost to follow-up. These data
suggest that although those lost to follow-up at one
wave may be more likely to be lost to follow-up at
subsequent waves, this is clearly not always the case

146 The Gerontologist
(Mihelic & Crimmins, 1997). As a result, the exclu-
sion of those lost to follow-up at any wave of data
collection is likely to bias the understanding of func-
tional status pathways (Dubin & Rivers, 1990; Little &
Rubin, 1990; Little & Schenker, 1995). The same can
be said for those who were successfully re-inter-
viewed at any given wave of data collection but
failed to answer one or more of the functional limita-
tion questions.
Rethinking functional limitation pathways, how-
ever, has a price. That price involves having no
straightforward methods for deriving simple statistical
summaries of the approximately 1 billion pathways
possible in these data and predicting who will travel
down them. The development and application of
such statistical techniques is sorely needed. In their
absence, only part of the trajectory story can be told.
For example, the simple analysis presented here, which
focused on the 13 most common states, results in ig-
noring up to one fourth of the persons residing in the
selected origin or destination states in the out-waves.
Until more appropriate statistical techniques are
available, it will be necessary to take intermediate
approaches that restrict attention to comparing and
contrasting the risk factors associated with particu-
larly intriguing trajectories emanating from a com-
mon origin state. One example of such a targeted
and relatively primitive contrast would involve focus-
ing on the 6,443 older adults in these data who
had no functional limitations at baseline (i.e., state
00000). By using a variety of background, personal,
social, economic, and disease history measures, re-
searchers could estimate multinomial logistic regres-
sion models in which those with no functional limita-
tions at the final follow-up were contrasted with
those in the next six most common final destination
states (i.e., states 99999, 77777, 88888, 00001,
11111, and 00010). Although this would not take
into consideration the intervening serial transitions
involving waves 2 through 6, it would provide the
opportunity to identify differential risk factors associ-
ated with the most common ultimate destination
states for those older adults originating in the most
common states. At least, that would be a beginning.
