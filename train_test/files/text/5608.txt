Introduction
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) (2006,
2016), type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic disease that occurs
when either the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or
the body uses insulin ineffectively, which is commonly asso-
ciated with elevated blood glucose. T2D differs from type 1
diabetes in that insulin intake is not required for survival. The
increasing prevalence of T2D is a major public health prob-
lem, with approximately 13percent of the population world-
wide having a diabetes diagnosis, of which around 90percent
is a type 2 and an estimated total annual cost of US$348 bil-
lion in North America, which correspond to almost 14
per-
cent of the total health budget of the region (International
Diabetes Federation, 2015). Until recently, T2D manifested
mainly in adults 40years and older, but in the last 20years,
an increase in the prevalence of T2D among youth has been
observed (Dabelea et al., 2014). Physical activity (PA) plays
a crucial role in the treatment of T2D (Colberg et al., 2016;
Sigal et al., 2006; Zanuso et al., 2010). By following the rec-
ommendations of practicing at least 150minutes of moderate
to vigorous PA (MVPA) per week (including aerobic and
resistance exercises), regular PA practice promotes the man-
agement of core metabolic goals for T2D, glycemia, arterial
pressure, and cholesterol (American Diabetes Association
(ADA), 2014, 2017; Colberg et al., 2016). It is worth noting
that only 13percent of patients are achieving the composite
goal of these three clinical indicators (Leiter et al., 2013).
Despite the benefits of PA for T2D, between 60 and 70per-
cent of adults with diabetes in the United States and in
Canada are not practicing enough PA or are not considered
physically active (Health Canada, 2002; Morrato et al., 2007;
Palakodeti et al., 2015), compared to between 40 and 50per-
cent of adults in the non-diabetic US and Canadian popula-
tions (Health Canada, 2002; Morrato et al., 2007; Statistics
Canada, 2014; Ward et al., 2016)
Given these participation trends, it has become essential
to understand why so few adults with T2D (hereafter T2D
adults) regularly practice PA, despite the existing documen-
tation on its beneficial effects for their health. To examine
this question, some authors have published work focusing
on PA self-reported barriers in T2D adults. For instance, in
a systematic review including 13 studies totaling 3465
Self-regulation resources and physical
activity participation among adults
with type 2 diabetes

Abstract
Physical activity plays a crucial role in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, it is important to
understand why so few adults with type 2 diabetes regularly engage in physical activity. The role of self-regulation in the
context of health-related behavior adherence, especially in terms of physical activity engagement and adherence, has
largely been reviewed based on the strength energy model. Building on this line of research, the aim of this theoretical
work was to highlight how self-regulation and ego depletion can influence the lower rate of physical activity participation
among adults with type 2 diabetes, compared to adults from the general population.

Theoretical Contribution/Commentary
2 Health Psychology Open 
participants from six different countries (United Kingdom,
United States, South Africa, Kuwait, Australia, and
Canada), Korkiakangas et al. (2009) have summarized and
organized the main barriers reported by T2D adults in seven
categories: lack of motivation, health problems, negative
emotions (e.g. shame), lack of social support, lack of facili-
ties for exercises, cultural barriers, and weather.
A promising theoretical approach to understanding and
solving this concern is the strength energy model (SEM,
also known as the strength model of self-control, the self-
regulatory strength model, or simply the strength model),
developed by Baumeister and colleagues (Baumeister et al.,
1998, 2007; Baumeister and Heatherton, 1996; Muraven
and Baumeister, 2000; Vohs and Heatherton, 2000).
According to the SEM, self-control is a finite resource that
determines the capacity for effortful control over dominant
responses and, once expended, it leads to impaired self-
control in task performance, known as ego depletion. More
precisely, "ego depletion refers to the state of diminished
self-control resources, when one cannot or does not suc-
cessfully implement further control" (Maranges and
Baumeister, 2016). Building on the SEM's assumptions,
Hagger et al. (2009, 2010a, 2010b) recently conducted a
literature review offering researchers and practitioners a
better understanding of self-regulation and ego depletion in
the context of health-related behavior adherence, especially
in terms of PA engagement and adherence. Within their
work, these authors describe extensively how the SEM can
explain behavioral self-regulation in a PA participation
context.
The SEM, its principal components, and its implications
for PA practice are described below. Then, based on this
model's assumptions regarding self-regulation resources,
the herein work aims to explain how self-regulation could
play a major role in the difficulties experienced by T2D
adults related to PA practice compared to adults from the
normal population. More specifically, section "Components
of the SEM" presents the two key concepts of the SEM,
namely, self-control and self-regulation. Section
"Underlying assumptions of the SEM" explains the under-
lying hypotheses of the SEM as self-control resource exer-
tion, replenishment, and improvement. Section "The
physiological energy resource of self-regulation" reports
the latest theoretical advances in terms of the physiological
counterpart of the SEM and its "energy reserve." Section
"Fatigue, ego depletion, and self-regulatory failure" pre-
sents key concepts related to self-regulatory exertion and
its expected consequences, while section "Using the SEM
to explain the low rate of PA participation among T2D
adults" introduces how, according to the SEM, T2D adults
could be vulnerable to chronic ego depletion, which can
explain their lower PA participation. Several strategies to
overcome ego depletion are then provided in section
"Strategies for preventing self-regulatory failure in the con-
text of PA participation among T2D adults," followed by
suggestions for future research in section "Implications and
future directions." Of note is that although few sections
look at self-regulation physiological substrates (i.e. glu-
cose, brain structures, and executive functions), the main
focus of this work consists of examining the psychological
(versus physiological) perspective of self-regulation and its
impact on PA engagement.
Components of the SEM
Self-control
According to the SEM, self-control is a capacity that
depends on a global limited resource that can become
depleted or replenished following different behaviors. This
capacity tends to conserve energy and can be improved
with training (Vohs and Baumeister, 2016). Self-control
resources are global and limited because every task that
requires self-control uses the same resources. No matter
what caused the depletion, if the resource is so low that
self-control cannot be exerted efficiently, successful com-
pletion of the task will be impeded (Hagger et al., 2010b;
Muraven and Baumeister, 2000). More details on these
underlying assumptions of the SEM (conservation, recov-
ery, and training) are presented further below.
Self-control has major positive impacts on a variety of
life domains: work, school, relationships, health, health-
related behaviors, and longevity (Maranges and Baumeister,
2016). It also seems that the benefits of increased self-con-
trol are linear, never reaching a point where more self-con-
trol would be detrimental (De Ridder et al., 2012; Tangney
et al., 2004). Moreover, self-control as a trait (dispositional
self-control) is strongly associated with the formation and
maintenance of habits, as well as breaking habits and mak-
ing life choices that reduce exposure to temptations (De
Ridder et al., 2012; Vohs and Baumeister, 2016). Punctual,
specific acts of self-control (Maranges and Baumeister,
2016), like refraining the urge to eat a doughnut before an
aerobic class, are considered sub-processes of self-regula-
tion, "those that aim to override unwanted, prepotent
impulses or urges" (Hofmann et al., 2012).
Self-regulation
The term "self-regulation" is considered as "the ability to
alter one's responses based on rules, goals, ideals, norms,
plans, and other standards" or as "a set of psychological and
perceptual processes by which individuals work toward the
achievement of goals and objectives by keeping them on
track and minimizing distractions or impulses" (Baumeister
and Vohs, 2016; Carver and Scheier, 2001). Generally
speaking, self-regulation arises in response to a clash
between two desires, one that is more focused on immediate
interests and another that is more distant and that takes into
consideration what would be best, all things considered
Castonguay et al. 3
(Baumeister and Vohs, 2007). Self-regulation is a process
working as a feedback loop in which the actual state is com-
pared with the desired state and in which adjustments (punc-
tual acts of self-control) are made when deviations from the
goal occur (Carver and Scheier, 2016). For example, when
people engage in a new PA routine, they may face barriers,
including fatigue. Using self-regulation would mean
remembering that a goal has not yet been achieved and then
choosing to push oneself to engage in the activity, despite
feeling fatigued. In this example, pushing oneself is a form
of exerting self-control to stay in line with a goal.
When we feel the desire to act in a certain way, but we
choose to act in a way that would be more appropriate or
consistent with our goals, we show self-regulation, which is
based on four variables: the standard, monitoring, energy,
and motivation (Baumeister and Vohs, 2007). The standard
is the criterion or the goal according to which we want to
align our behavior. For example, when people attend fitness
classes, they try to replicate the movements made by the
instructor. They do not execute movements impulsively, as
the standard in such a situation is to imitate the instructor. It
could also be a more personal and broader goal, such as
being physically active. Monitoring refers to focusing atten-
tion on a behavior and to the desire to undertake and com-
pare different standards. In other words, it is the action of
comparing the actual state with the desired state and ensur-
ing the actual behavior stays in line with the goal.According
to the SEM, controlling, changing, or retaining a behavior;
making a decision; and showing willingness require energy.
This energy, also known as self-regulatory strength, a self-
control resource, or willpower, is considered a global lim-
ited internal resource (Baumeister et al., 1998; Baumeister
and Vohs, 2016; Hagger et al., 2009; Vohs et al., 2008). Of
note is that the capacity and effectiveness to regulate oneself
depend on the available energy level. If this level is so low
that behaviors requiring self-control are affected negatively
or the person lacks willingness, the individual will enter a
state of ego depletion (Baumeister and Vohs, 2007). For
example, in the morning after a good night's sleep, it is more
likely that one will have enough energy to undertake a new
resolution, such as starting a new workout program, com-
pared to in the evening. However, after a day of particularly
demanding work, it is possible that one will not have enough
energy to regulate him or herself. In this situation, it will be
more difficult to undertake the same resolution. The motiva-
tion level is the fourth variable on which the self-regulation
capacity stands (Baumeister and Vohs, 2007). For someone
to self-regulate voluntarily, one must be motivated to
observe the standard, to use its resources, and, therefore, to
self-regulate. Thus, even when the first three variables are
favorable, if the person does not consider it important or is
not motivated to self-regulate, he or she will not. Worth
mentioning is that the four variables are all-important, but
not all necessary. For example, to some extent, motivation
can compensate for a lack of energy, allowing for successful
self-regulation even within a state of ego depletion, but only
temporarily (Baumeister and Vohs, 2007, 2016; Hagger
et al., 2010b). Eventually, the fatigue will become insur-
mountable, and replenishing activities will become
necessary.
Underlying assumptions of the SEM
As outlined by Hagger et al. (2010a, 2010b), the SEM is
based on three main underlying hypotheses: the conserva-
tion, the recovery, and the training hypotheses. According
to the conservation hypothesis, as self-control is drawn
from a limited energy reserve, individuals must allocate
such energy strategically while considering future events.
Therefore, if individuals consider that they will have to
engage in a demanding self-regulatory task in the future,
they will be more likely to conserve their resources. By
doing so, tasks requiring self-regulation could be affected
negatively in the meantime. The recovery hypothesis states
that following depletion, the self-regulation capacity can be
restored. Just as with a muscle, the time for recovery
depends on the intensity and duration of the depleting task.
The more severe the exertion, the longer the recovery will
be. A sufficient amount of breaks, relaxation sessions, and
sleep are essential in the replenishment of self-control
resources (Krizan and Garrett, 2016; Tyler and Burns,
2008). Finally, the training hypothesis supposes that the
self-regulation capacity can be developed and increased
through training (Hagger et al., 2010b; Muraven, 2010).
Just as a muscle would develop through regular, specific
exercises, appropriate exposure to self-control tasks is
expected to lead to improvements in self-regulation capac-
ity. Noteworthy is that such improvements are not limited
to training conditions; they could also be generalized to
other activities. For instance, as reported by Hagger et al.
(2010b), if someone trains the self-regulation capacity by
forcing him or herself to use a non-dominant hand for a
certain amount of time, the increase in the self-regulation
capacity could also benefit his or her adherence to a new
PA. However, enough recovery time and experience with
self-regulatory success are needed for the training to pro-
duce self-regulation performance improvements (Hagger
et al., 2010b).
The physiological energy resource of
self-regulation
Even though studies have reported a significant relation-
ship between glucose levels and ego depletion (Baumeister
and Vohs, 2016; Hagger and Chatzisarantis, 2013; Hagger
et al., 2010a), others have not succeeded in replicating
these results (Boyle et al., 2016; Dang, 2016; Vadillo et al.,
2016; Zahn et al., 2016). In response to the increasing num-
ber of published arguments against the direct link between
glucose and self-control, Baumeister and Vohs (2016)
4 Health Psychology Open 
suggested that glucose alone is not sufficient to explain the
SEM, because ego depletion (the state of self-control
resource exertion) appears long before glucose exertion.
Therefore, other research avenues have been suggested to
replace the glucose hypothesis as a physiological equiva-
lent to willpower, such as adenosine (Baumeister and Vohs,
2016). Even if glucose were the equivalent of willpower
(the limited physiological energy resource used by self-
regulation), self-regulation alone would not be a threat to
the body's global reserve of glucose (Baumeister, 2016;
Baumeister and Vohs, 2016; Vohs and Baumeister, 2016).
Self-regulation relies on several executive functions (e.g.
inhibiting, monitoring, and shifting) (Hirt et al., 2016) and,
by extension, brain structures (Magen et al., 2014; Vohs
and Baumeister, 2016) that rely on glucose, but the energy
consumption of self-regulation is too small to disrupt glu-
cose levels in the brain (Segerstrom et al., 2016).According
to Baumeister and Vohs (Baumeister and Vohs, 2016; Vohs
and Baumeister, 2016), the main taxing effect of self-regu-
lation would not be on the glucose reserve, but on brain
receptiveness, attention, and mental effort.
Fatigue, ego depletion, and self-
regulatory failure
Similar to the muscles, neurological processes associated
with self-regulation are incapacitated by continuous solici-
tation (Wagner and Heatherton, 2016). Even though the
body's energy levels are still largely sufficient to sustain
effort for a longer period, an increase in fatigue leads to
decreased performance (Krizan and Garrett, 2016). Only
appropriate replenishment conditions (e.g. taking breaks,
doing enjoyable activities, and sleeping) can counteract the
deleterious effects. It has been suggested that this feeling of
fatigue could be attributed to a conservation tendency
toward the executive functions required by self-regulation
(Krizan and Garrett, 2016). This tendency would limit uses
of executive functions and self-regulation to preserve brain
receptiveness for other processes. When willpower runs
low after self-control exertion, the individual enters a state
of self-regulatory fatigue called ego depletion (Baumeister,
2014). It is important to note that even though general
fatigue can affect self-control and therefore ego depletion,
ego depletion is not fatigue (Baumeister et al., 2006; Hagger
et al., 2016; Vohs et al., 2011). Within a state of ego deple-
tion, there are not enough resources left to self-regulate,
which increases the chance of a self-regulatory failure.
A self-regulatory failure is characterized by a lack of self-
control or by its opposite, impulsivity, and it takes the form
of either under regulations ("failure to exert control over
oneself") or misregulations ("exerting control in a way that
fails to produce the desired result") (Baumeister et al., 1994;
Sayette and Creswell, 2016). In other words, a self-regula-
tory failure occurs when the self-regulation process fails. In
a PA context, a self-regulatory failure would imply, for
instance, the skipping of a training session after an exerting
workday because one does not feel like training. A self-regu-
latory failure is expected to occur when (1) a desire becomes
too strong, (2) self-regulatory fatigue becomes too strong, or
(3) the importance of the goal (motivation) is not strong
enough (Heatherton and Wagner, 2011; Krizan and Garrett,
2016). Physiologically, a self-regulatory failure has been
proposed to be the result of a connectivity impairment among
the brain structures responsible for the executive functions
essential to self-regulation (Vohs and Baumeister, 2016).
Using the SEM to explain the low rate
of PA participation among T2D adults
The limited resource model of self-control, as conceptual-
ized by the SEM, could prove useful in explaining the low
PA participation among T2D adults (Adriaanse et al., 2013;
Cradock et al., 2017). As the integration of regular PA prac-
tice is one of the many complex tasks T2D adults must
accomplish to manage their condition optimally (Powers
et al., 2017), having a sufficient self-regulation capacity acts
as a facilitator and is positively associated with goal achieve-
ment (Baumeister et al., 1998; Muraven and Baumeister,
2000). Conversely, the self-regulation capacity becomes an
important barrier to PA engagement if it becomes exhausted
by previous self-control demands, too many self-control
tasks undertaken simultaneously, or the anticipation of a
future activity requiring self-regulation (Dorris et al., 2012;
Hagger et al., 2010b; Martin Ginis and Bray, 2010; Muraven
et al., 2006). In such a situation, one is left in a state of
exhaustion or ego depletion, and such consequences as self-
regulatory failure are expected (Hagger et al., 2009).
Because T2D adults must engage in several tasks to manage
and cope with their condition, such as monitoring their diets
(what to eat, when to eat, what portion size, etc.), glucose
levels (keeping it within the acceptable range), and medica-
tions (when to take what) (Powers et al., 2017), they are left
with few self-regulatory resources to integrate and sustain
PA into their daily life. This in itself requires a high level of
self-control (Hagger et al., 2009).
In line with the issue raised above regarding PA engage-
ment and self-regulation, a highly interesting research ave-
nue pertains to the SEM's capacity to explain the low rate
Figure 1. How diabetes management related tasks influence
self-regulation resources and PA practice among T2D adults.
Castonguay et al. 5
of PA participation among T2D adults compared to that
among adults from the general population. Accordingly, the
potential effects of (1) glucose, brain structures, and execu-
tive functions; (2) mood regulation; and (3) T2D-related
symptoms on ego depletion and, as a consequence, on PA
participation among T2D adults are presented below and
resumed in Figure 1. Each topic is described as a potential
predisposition for T2D adults to be ego depleted, rendering
them more vulnerable to self-regulatory failures when
attempting to include PA in their daily life.
Glucose, brain structures, and executive
functions
Over the past years, glucose has been proposed as a physi-
ological equivalent of willpower, the self-control resource
that becomes depleted with usage (Gailliot and Baumeister,
2007; Gailliot et al., 2007). However, recent studies, as
reported by the meta-analysis of Vadillo et al. (2016), have
failed to establish a clear link between glucose and self-
regulation, casting doubt on their hypothesized link.
Nevertheless, some evidence shows that glucose still plays
an important role in self-regulation (Baumeister and Vohs,
2016). This seems an important consideration for T2D
adults, given that their condition is intrinsically related to
blood glucose monitoring (Levin et al., 1999; WHO, 2016).
For instance, the impact of glucose on self-regulation
among T2D adults could be indirect by means of its effect
on brain structures. This assumption is partially supported
by a recent suggestion that a self-regulatory failure could
be the result of reduced coupling between brain regions,
mainly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Wagner and
Heatherton, 2016). In fact, three sub-regions of the PFC
(ventromedial PFC, lateral PFC, and anterior cingulate cor-
tex), each linked to executive functions and self-regulatory
processes, are largely interconnected with one another and
have connections with other self-regulation-related brain
regions. For example, the ventromedial PFC is associated
with maintaining self-control, the lateral PFC with recog-
nizing when to switch tasks, and the anterior cingulate cor-
tex with the capacity to keep a behavior in line with a goal.
Additionally, many studies have linked ego depletion to
reduced connectivity between and from those three regions
(Wagner and Heatherton, 2016).
The connectivity explanation of a self-regulatory fail-
ure concurs with the SEM idea that self-regulation
depends on a common resource that becomes depleted
through exertion. It could explain why prior studies have
found a significant relation between glucose and self-reg-
ulation. As reported by a recent meta-analysis, swishing a
glucose solution around in the mouth is the only way glu-
cose may significantly be implicated in self-control
(Dang, 2016). This could be explained by the activation of
self-regulation-related brain regions by glucose-sensitive
receptors in the mouth (Wagner and Heatherton, 2016).
Moreover, according to the results of a meta-analysis
examining the impact of diabetes on cognitive functions
(McCrimmon et al., 2012), as well as a meta-analysis sur-
veying the impact of T2D on memory and executive func-
tions (Sadanand et al., 2016), T2D significantly burdens
cognitive functioning. Among the reported affected cog-
nitive functions, executive functions and attention are
essential to self-regulation (Vohs and Baumeister, 2016).
T2D is also associated with the deterioration of many
brain structures linked with those cognitive functions,
such as the frontal lobe (Moulton et al., 2015), being
highly responsible for self-regulation and normal func-
tioning (Vohs and Baumeister, 2016). Thus, even though
the exact dynamic between glucose and self-control
remains to be explained, it is still accepted that glucose
plays a significant role in self-regulation. Given the intrin-
sic relation between glucose and their condition, T2D
adults could be physiologically more prone to experience
self-regulatory failures.
Mood regulation
Depression, anxiety, stress, and diabetes-related distress.Com-
pared to the non-diabetic population, T2D adults are more
prone to suffer from depression (Mezuk et al., 2008; Nou-
wen et al., 2010; Roy and Lloyd, 2012), anxiety disorders,
and distress (Fisher et al., 2008), which can seriously hin-
der diabetes self-management (Powers et al., 2017), includ-
ing PA participation (Ciechanowski et al., 2000). Moreover,
T2D adults tend to feel negative emotions about PA. They
feel ashamed to train with people who do not have T2D,
and they are afraid of getting hurt and of experiencing a
hypoglycemic episode, which could impede their PA
engagement (Korkiakangas et al., 2009). According to the
SEM conceptual framework, regarding the assumption that
the self-control capacity is global and limited, it is expected
that negative emotional states, such as depressive and anx-
ious symptoms related to PA or not, would have a negative
impact on the self-control capacity (Baumeister et al., 1999;
Muraven and Baumeister, 2000). Therefore, T2D adults
who are particularly vulnerable to negative emotional states
would also be more prone to experience ego depletion. In
such a state, a self-regulatory failure is more likely to occur,
and thus, PA practice and diabetes self-management are
likely to be impeded.
It is also important to consider the impact of stressful
life events on diabetes self-management and PA adherence
among T2D adults. According to Baumeister et al. (1999),
stressful life events tax the self-control capacity, and there-
fore, fewer resources remain to cope with the demands
associated with other activities. Moreover, the act of coping
in the face of stress depletes self-control resources and neg-
atively affects self-control performance (Muraven and
Baumeister, 2000). As the integration of PA into one's life
requires a great amount of self-control, it is proposed that
6 Health Psychology Open 
stress can affect PA adherence (Hagger et al., 2009, 2010b).
In addition, as stress directly draws from one's self-regula-
tion capacity (Baumeister et al., 1999), it is susceptible to
affect negatively the executive functions and brain struc-
tures (McEwen, 2016) associated with self-regulation and
to worsen diabetes management and glucose levels (ADA,
2017). Prior research supports the negative impact of
depression (Katon et al., 2010), anxiety (Lipscombe et al.,
2014), and perceived stress (Delahanty et al., 2006) on PA
engagement among T2D adults.
In addition to daily stress, the multiple taxing tasks
related to diabetes self-management are directly predictive
of a specific form of stress called diabetes distress, which
is highly common among people with diabetes (Young-
Hyman et al., 2016). According to the ADA (2017), diabe-
tes distress is associated with "significant negative
psychological reactions related to emotional burdens and
worries specific to an individual's experience in having to
manage a severe, complicated, and demanding chronic dis-
ease such as diabetes." T2D adults are exposed to a daily
burden associated with a high stress potential, which is the
self-management of their condition. Indeed, the ADA, the
American Association of Diabetes Educators, and the
Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics state, "Diabetes is a
chronic disease that requires a person with diabetes to
make a multitude of daily self-management decisions and
to perform complex care activities" (Powers et al., 2017).
This statement has two main implications regarding the
self-regulation capacity and therefore ego depletion for
T2D adults. First, it requires a person newly diagnosed
with T2D to learn and incorporate into his or her life and
daily routine complex new habits. Second, even after
learning is achieved or years after diagnosis, T2D still
requires daily complex self-management decisions. These
two implications have an important impact on self-control
resources, making T2D adults more prone to a state of
chronic ego depletion, which has the potential to burden a
wide variety of life aspects, including PA engagement
(Wang et al., 2015).
T2D-related symptoms
According to Grootenhuis et al. (1994), the most common
T2D-associated symptoms include frequent urination, sig-
nificant thirst, a lack of energy, irritability, fatigue, a lack of
concentration, palpitations, shortness of breath, pain, loss
of sensation, sensations of tingling or prickling, and vision
deterioration. All of these symptoms are potential discom-
forts with which T2D adults must cope, including during
their PA session. In line with prior work by Solberg Nes
et al. (2009, 2010, 2011) on chronic multi-symptom ill-
nesses and on coping with chronic pain, the authors herein
suggest that symptoms related to T2D may diminish self-
control resources. Moreover, T2D adults are often afflicted
with poor sleep quality (Luyster and Dunbar-Jacob, 2011)
and sleep disorders (Davies et al., 2006; Shaw et al., 2008;
West et al., 2006). Those who do not have enough sleep and
who have a poor sleep quality also tend to present poorer
glycemic control and therefore higher HbA1c levels (Trento
et al., 2008), which in turn leads to more severe diabetes-
related symptoms, including fatigue. As explained above,
self-control resources become replenished, among others,
through sleep. If sleep sessions are deficient or incomplete,
T2D adults potentially cannot restore fully the energy level
required to self-regulate their daily lives and attain their
goals.
Conclusion on the SEM's capacity to explain the
low rate of PA participation among T2D adults
Compared to the general population, T2D adults engage
less frequently in PA (Health Canada, 2002; Morrato et al.,
2007; Nelson et al., 2002; Plotnikoff et al., 2011; Statistics
Canada, 2014; Ward et al., 2016). In authors' view, this
could be explained by the fact that T2D adults present
higher self-regulation vulnerabilities compared to others.
Although the hypothesis according to which glucose is the
equivalent of willpower could potentially explain this dif-
ference (given that glucose regulation is a core problem
associated with T2D), recent developments in the SEM
tend to confirm that glucose is not the equivalent of will-
power, although it still plays an important role in self- regu-
lation (Baumeister and Vohs, 2016; Vadillo et al., 2016).
Therefore, besides the hypothetical direct link between glu-
cose and self-regulation, other factors can explain why T2D
adults, given their condition, would be more susceptible to
chronic ego depletion. First, T2D has been shown to tax
significantly cognitive functioning, including the executive
functions essential to self-regulation, and to deteriorate
brain regions underlying these functions. Second, T2D
adults present higher depressive and anxious symptoms
than the general population, directly impeding their self-
control. Finally, symptoms associated with T2D can also
drain self-regulation resources, if only because of pain and
impaired sleep quality. Specifically, every T2D-related
symptom comes with a potential self-control cost given that
individuals need to cope with discomfort or pain through
daily activities, including PA sessions.
Strategies for preventing
self-regulatory failure in the context of
PA participation among T2D adults
The main objective of the present theoretical review was to
highlight the importance of the SEM when it comes to
explaining the lower rate of PA participation among T2D
adults compared to adults from the general population. As
such, the authors herein presented the latest theoretical
developments in the SEM, as well as the underlying rationale
or reasons why T2D adults would be more susceptible to
Castonguay et al. 7
chronic ego depletion, which, in turn, favors self-regulatory
failure in PAengagement. In accordance with the SEM, chal-
lenging new behaviors, such as PA practice, should be inte-
grated carefully and progressively to avoid ego depletion and
dropout. T2D adults are often asked to work on multiple,
complex, and challenging tasks and to perform new behav-
iors, such as acquiring knowledge related to diabetes man-
agement, changing their diets, monitoring their glucose
levels, and, if required, discontinuing drinking alcohol and
smoking. This list cannot be undertaken all at once. Trying to
do so could render a person more vulnerable to burnout
(Schmidt et al., 2007) and could lead to a state of chronic ego
depletion (Hagger et al., 2010a). Indeed, when managing
their condition, T2D adults may experience an overload of
demanding self-control tasks combined with a lack of breaks
and self-regulatory success. As outlined by Hagger et al.
(2010a), such a situation could be the equivalent of over-
training, which in this case would lead to a state of chronic
ego depletion.
In consideration of the above-mentioned points, T2D
adults can use various strategies to cope with their condi-
tion, while being careful with their self-regulation capacity
and other demanding activities. The next section aims to
present strategies that can prevent self-regulatory failures
in the context of PA participation and T2D adult-related
vulnerabilities. Because few examples in the literature
exist regarding the promotion of self-regulation in T2D
adults in a PA participation context, strategies to prevent
ego depletion or to restore the self-regulation capacity are
suggested based on research conducted with non-T2D
individuals.
Sequential integration of new behaviors
The first technique to prevent ego depletion and increase
PA engagement in T2D adults pertains to the progressive
integration of new behaviors. A new behavior integrated
into T2D adults' routines is more likely to be maintained
over time if this additional demand on self-control is well
planned to occur when self-control resources are expected
to be available (Hagger et al., 2010b). If several new behav-
iors must be integrated into one's routine, as is the case for
adults newly diagnosed with T2D (e.g. acquiring knowl-
edge associated with T2D management, managing a diet,
and engaging in PA regularly), patients are advised to
undertake one new behavior at the time. Even though other
behaviors are important, individuals are encouraged to ini-
tiate each progressively and to select attainable goals
(Hagger et al., 2010b). Trying to modify or to integrate too
many novel behaviors at the same time can be too demand-
ing on self-control resources, therefore increasing the risk
of self-regulatory failure and PA dropout. Results obtained
by Jenkins et al. (2016) corroborate this assumption among
adults diagnosed with T2D trying to improve their dietary
adherence. These researchers found that the more severe
the overexertion of self-control, the sooner the dietary
relapse.
Self-regulation training
Self-regulation training is another strategy to counter ego
depletion and increase PA engagement among T2D adults.
Self-regulation training can be undertaken in the same way
as muscle training. Regular exposure to demanding situa-
tions in which one experiences self-regulatory success, fol-
lowed by sufficient breaks and rest to allow for the
replenishment of self-control resources, is expected to lead
to self-regulation improvements (Hagger et al., 2010b).
Every task requiring self-control, from weak urges to those
that challenge self-regulatory capacity limits, is a potential
self-regulation training opportunity, provided one remains
within the limits of his or her current capacity. Exceeding
one's capacity, even for a training exercise, can lead to ego
depletion and self-regulatory failure. However, just as the
benefits of developing self-regulation are transferable to
other situations, the costs of ego depletion are too. Thus,
self-regulation improvements or ego depletion developed
during a training task could affect primary goal-related
self-control tasks. Training self-regulation to achieve a spe-
cific goal can be achieved in a goal-related context with
time and practice or in a second, easier goal-related context
that will bolster self-regulation in general, which will also
benefit the main goal. It is expected that these additional
self-control challenges will promote PA self-regulation. In
other words, additional self-control challenges will improve
the likelihood of self-regulatory success in PA engagement
and adherence by improving individuals' self-regulation
capacity through prior integration of an easier behavior. For
instance, T2D adults could train their self-regulation skill
by increasing the amount of vegetables they eat daily. Once
this behavior has been assimilated into their routine, eating
more vegetables won't require much self-regulatory
resources anymore and PA practice will be easier to initiate.
Stated otherwise, the self-regulation process associated
with PA practice is expected to be facilitated by prior self-
regulatory success related to vegetables consumption.
Then, breaks within and between self-control tasks, includ-
ing quality sleep and relaxation, are to be planned accord-
ing to the intensity of the self-control demands.
The greater the depletion, the longer the resting period
must be. As previously mentioned, sleep quality has multi-
ple positive effects on the lives of T2D adults. Regarding
brain function, sleep has been shown to play an important
role in brain connectivity in the frontal brain regions
(Verweij et al., 2014), which are considered to play a cen-
tral role in self-regulation. Furthermore, reduced brain con-
nectivity is actually considered a potential physiological
equivalent of ego depletion (Vohs and Baumeister, 2016).
Therefore, increasing sleep quality could improve the
capacity to self-regulate among T2D adults.
8 Health Psychology Open 
Engaging in PA to diminish T2D-related self-
regulatory vulnerabilities
A third way to forestall ego depletion and promote PA par-
ticipation in T2D adults is actually to initiate and sustain
PA engagement. In fact, engaging in PA regularly has been
found to be associated with an increase in brain volume,
as well as better cognitive functioning, particularly in
terms of attention, executive functions, and the brain
regions associated with self-regulation in non-clinical
populations (Buckley et al., 2014; Colcombe et al., 2006;
Colcombe and Kramer, 2003; Daly et al., 2014). Likewise,
engaging in PA regularly has been found to increase exec-
utive functions in T2D adults (Indelicato, 2009; Vincent,
2014), which are important for self-regulation. Therefore,
PA could help counteract the damaging effects of T2D on
the brain and as such could diminish the self-regulatory
vulnerability of T2D adults. In addition, PA has been
shown to aid in blood glucose regulation, improve well-
being, and diminish some T2D-related symptoms (Colberg
et al., 2016; Sigal et al., 2013; Young-Hyman et al., 2016;
Zanuso et al., 2010). Finally, as indicated further above,
the integration of regular PA practice in one's daily rou-
tine represents an opportunity for self-regulation training.
When PA is performed appropriately, with enough rest
and chances for success, it can increase the self-regulation
capacity and render future self-regulation tasks easier
(Hagger et al., 2010b).
Forming habits
Another strategy to hamper ego depletion and increase PA
participation among T2D adults is converting PA into a
habit and making life choices that reduce exposure to temp-
tations (e.g. going to a gym close to one's workplace or
choosing a route between work and home that does not pass
by one's favorite fast-food restaurant). These are effective
strategies to reduce self-control demands (De Ridder et al.,
2012; Maranges and Baumeister, 2016). Unsurprisingly, it
has been suggested that to preserve self-control resources,
people benefit from working on automatizing their behav-
iors (Baumeister and Alquist, 2009). When a behavior
becomes a habit, the action occurs almost automatically,
without really paying attention to the pros and cons and
requiring less decision-making, thus necessitating less self-
control. T2D adults have many complex decisions to make
daily to manage their condition. To lighten this self-regula-
tion burden, they could attempt to convert as many deci-
sions as possible into habits. For instance, if one decides to
incorporate PA practice into his or her daily life, automat-
ing this action could involve finding a parking spot a
10-minute moderate walk from work and using this same
parking spot every workday. Eventually, using this parking
spot and taking this moderate walk will become a habit, and
no self-control will be necessary.
Using planning techniques
Planning is another self-regulatory strategy that can facili-
tate PA participation and limit ego depletion, because the
execution of such a strategy does not require self-control
resources (Gollwitzer, 1999; Hagger et al., 2010b). Once a
goal has been chosen and the intention of acting toward this
goal has been set, planning concretizes the idea and helps in
automating future decisions related to goal-associated
behaviors (Hagger and Luszczynska, 2014). It allows for
deliberation and decision-making in advance so that when
the time comes to act, one will be able to follow the plan
automatically, almost without thinking or making any deci-
sions, which will lighten the self-regulation burden.
Planning techniques facilitate the realization of one's inten-
tion and favor its translation into action by defining a spe-
cific context in which the action will take place (when and
where) and the details of said action (how) (Hagger and
Luszczynska, 2014). Worth noting is that planning tech-
niques can be learned, practiced, and improved to help peo-
ple develop their self-regulatory capacity (Schwarzer,
2008). However, one must be cautious when making sev-
eral plans because elaboration requires self-regulatory
resources, which makes the elaboration of multiple plans
particularly taxing (Hagger and Luszczynska, 2014).
Having too many plans could hinder the adoption of each
specific plan as a result of the increased risk of triggering
opposing goals (Hagger and Luszczynska, 2014).
Using mental contrasting
Another self-regulatory technique used to increase PA par-
ticipation while minimizing self-control demands is mental
contrasting. This technique consists of contrasting the
achievement of a goal with the obstacles of the current real-
ity (Oettingen, 2000, 2012). Mental contrasting has been
shown to support T2D adults in the self-management of
their condition, including PAparticipation (Adriaanse et al.,
2013). To illustrate this technique, if one has the goal to
engage in PA for 30minutes per day, he or she could think
about four desirable characteristics related to the achieve-
ment of this goal and then think about four current obsta-
cles to achieving this goal. This technique brings the present
and the future together, allowing for current obstacles to be
perceived as being in the way, which forces individuals to
take position, according to the perceived feasibility of the
task (Oettingen and Gollwitzer, 2010). If the goal is deemed
achievable, one will feel the need to surmount any obsta-
cles to realize the goal. If expectations of success are low,
the goal is likely to be abandoned. Therefore, mental con-
trasting helps distinguish achievable from non-achievable
goals, thus preventing the waste of personal resources and
focusing on goals having higher chances of success
(Oettingen et al., 2010; Oettingen and Gollwitzer, 2010).
Moreover, mental contrasting favors the informed selection
Castonguay et al. 9
of a reasonable goal, evaluates its feasibility, and provides
engagement and energy for its achievement (Oettingen and
Cachia, 2016; Oettingen et al., 2010; Sheeran et al., 2005).
Simply put by Oettingen et al. (2010), "Mental contrasting
is a self-regulation strategy to select effective means to an
end." Interestingly, the positive impact of mental contrast-
ing does not require a precise end goal. One can simply
focus on the benefits of making progress toward the goal
and contrast the obstacles hindering this progress (Oettingen
et al., 2010).
Worth mentioning is that recent research has demon-
strated that the combination of mental contrasting and plan-
ning was associated with greater outcomes in terms of goal
attainment than each one alone, although it requires self-
control during the elaboration stage (Hagger and
Luszczynska, 2014; Oettingen et al., 2015). It is thus rec-
ommended that those techniques be used together with
careful consideration of self-regulatory resource availabil-
ity. More specifically, using mental contrasting in combina-
tion with planning techniques can lead individuals to (1)
choose a goal considered important and achievable (e.g.
30
minutes of PA/day); (2) realize the positive outcomes
associated with goal completion (e.g. better diabetes-
related symptom management); (3) become aware of the
obstacles separating the present state from the goal achieve-
ment state (e.g. poor weather and tiredness); (4) plan where,
when, and how they will engage in their activity (e.g. after
work, I will go to the 30minute aerobics class on my way
home); and (5) elaborate on strategies to overcome poten-
tial barriers (e.g. I took a class inside so weather will not be
an issue and if I feel tired, I will adapt the intensity of my
exercise).
Distracting and reframing
Distracting and reframing are also self-regulatory strategies
that can be used to increase PA participation while mini-
mizing ego depletion. When exercising self-control, focus-
ing directly on the demanding task has been shown to
decrease performance, while focusing on something else
increases it (Alberts et al., 2008). Focusing on the "cost" of
the activity may add more weight to the impulse one is try-
ing to control by rendering it more tempting (Alberts et al.,
2008). For instance, if one only concentrates on how diffi-
cult and demanding his or her aerobics class is, engagement
toward achieving the goal could diminish and the tempta-
tion of leaving class early could become more appealing.
Yet, focusing on anything other than the current activity,
such as completing an intense mental calculation, should
improve self-control and engagement toward achieving the
goal (Alberts et al., 2008).
By contrast, instead of thinking about anything but the
actual task requiring self-control (which does not affect the
"weight" of the temptation or goal), one could remember
that his or her future exercise-related goal (e.g. to run a
marathon, to lose 10 pounds, and to be healthy) has more
value than the temporary pleasure of leaving the aerobics
class early. This strategy is called reframing and it refers to
considering the importance of a present desire as secondary
to a future goal (Magen et al., 2014). Thus, while mental
contrasting compares a future goal with current obstacles,
reframing allows for the comparison of a future goal with a
more current, unanticipated one, usually associated with
temptation. Reframing could even be integrated as part of
the strategies used to overcome potential barriers. For
instance, one could tell himself or herself, "If my friends or
my colleagues invite me to have a cocktail after work, I will
reframe the importance of going to have a cocktail versus
going to my aerobics class." In this example, the person
would diminish the importance of the immediate goal,
"having fun," compared to that of the future goal associated
with the choice of going to the aerobics class (e.g. control-
ling blood glucose level to feel healthier). In sum, refram-
ing helps one maintain perspective of the reasons for his or
her actions.
Examining one's motivation
The reasons or motivations behind a behavior also play an
important role in terms of the self-regulation resource exer-
tion associated with PA practice (Vohs and Baumeister,
2016). According to the latest version of the SEM, motiva-
tion is considered one of the fundamental pillars of self-
regulation (Baumeister and Vohs, 2007). As some authors
working with self-determination theory (SDT) have sug-
gested (Muraven, 2008; Ryan and Deci, 2008), motivation
quality is important in terms of self-regulation. These
authors proposed that when motivated by controlled rea-
sons (engaging in an activity because of internal or external
pressures, such as avoiding guilt or gaining social approval),
PA engagement requires more self-regulation resources,
given that the behavior follows internal or external pres-
sures. By contrast, when PA is sustained by autonomous
motives (engaging in an activity for the inherent fun associ-
ated with it or for personally relevant outcomes, such as
being healthy), the behavior does not require self-control
and could even replenish self-regulation resources. Thus,
individuals with T2D would benefit in terms of self-regula-
tion from engaging in PA for autonomous reasons, such as
enjoying it or personally valuing its impact on their health.
While examining the effects of each motivational regula-
tion on a specific outcome (a variable-centered approach to
motivation) is acceptable, it is limited (Chemolli and Gagné,
2014), as it does not consider that for a given activity, differ-
ent motivational configurations may be present in an indi-
vidual (Deci and Ryan, 2002; Patrick, 2014; Vallerand,
1997). Using a person-centered approach with motivational
profiles allows for a better overview of individual motiva-
tional configurations (Pintrich, 2003; Vansteenkiste et al.,
2009). In line with this proposition, some researchers have
10 Health Psychology Open 
examined SDT-based motivational profiles in the PA
domain. While most have investigated motivational profiles
within the general adult population (Friederichs et al., 2015;
Guerin and Fortier, 2012; Matsumoto and Takenaka, 2004;
Stephan et al., 2010; Ullrich-French and Cox, 2009), very
few (Castonguay and Miquelon, 2017; Gourlan et al., 2016)
have explored these issues among T2D adults. In brief,
Gourlan et al. (2016) demonstrated that compared to other
T2D adults, participants presenting a self-determined pro-
file (i.e. individuals simultaneously showing higher levels
of autonomous motivation and lower levels of controlled
motivation and amotivation) reported more time spent prac-
ticing PA over a 12-month period. Similarly, Castonguay
and Miquelon (2017) found that T2D adults presenting a
self-determined profile reported engaging in PA more fre-
quently, and they were more likely to adhere to the PA
guidelines recommended for T2D adults. These results
highlight that beyond having a high level of autonomous
motivation toward PA, T2D adults must also possess low
levels of controlled motivation to perform and maintain PA
practice.
Implications and future directions
The aim of this review was to highlight the importance of
considering the SEM when it comes to explaining the rate
of lower PA participation among T2D adults compared to
adults from the general population. Based on this theoreti-
cal review, significant research avenues can be proposed.
The first research agenda pertains to the verification of the
hypothesis that states T2D adults are effectively more sus-
ceptible to chronic ego depletion than are adults from the
normal population, favoring self-regulatory failure in PA
engagement. To examine this assumption, a questionnaire
specifically assessing day-to-day ego depletion could be
developed. Such a measure should be adapted to T2D and
operationalized in line with prior works according to which
self-regulatory success is mainly characterized by engage-
ment in a behavior despite obstacles, and it is highly
dependent on sufficient rest (Baumeister and Vohs, 2016;
Carver and Scheier, 2001; Young, 2016). Based on prior
work, to gain a complete perspective of ego depletion (and
its link to PA participation) among T2D adults and from the
general population, such a questionnaire should measure
(1) participants' current self-regulation capacity level
(Ciarocco et al., 2012) (e.g. "If I had to engage in PA right
now, I would give up easily"), (2) self-regulation efficiency
(Neal and Carey, 2005) (e.g. "Today, to what extent did you
keep track of your progress toward your PA goals?"), and
(3) overall fatigue (Arbuckle et al., 2009) (e.g. "Today, to
what extent did you abandoned or give up your PA goals
because you were too tired or lack energy?").
Using this questionnaire, it would be possible to meas-
ure ego depletion in adults with and without T2D (present-
ing no other chronic health problems either) and to compare
the results obtained within both populations, controlling for
such key variables as sex, age, health issues, and body mass
index. As for PA frequency, it should be measured with
both subjective (self-reported) and objective (accelerome-
ter) measures on a daily basis among participants from both
populations. The main obstacles participants encounter in
their day-to-day PA participation (e.g. lack of time or facili-
ties and weather conditions) should also be measured. To
assess these constructs daily over a period of 1 or 2weeks,
researchers could use the ecological momentary assess-
ment (also known as the daily diary method or experience
sampling method). Such a research design would allow for
the verification of whether T2D adults tend to be more
chronically ego depleted, as well as how often they gave up
on their PA participation because of self-regulatory failure.
Based on the herein work's assumptions, the number of
times T2D adults (who should also be more susceptible ego
depletion) abandoned their PA goals because of self-regula-
tory failure should be higher than the number of adults from
the normal population.
Future studies should also examine the effects of the
vulnerability factors associated with ego depletion and PA
participation among T2D adults proposed in the herein
work. For instance, using measures of sleep, psychological
distress, and stress, researchers could verify the effects of
sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and stress on ego deple-
tion, as well as the effect of ego depletion on PA frequency.
This investigation could also be realized by means of the
ecological momentary assessment over a period of 1 to
2weeks. Again, PA frequency should be assessed with both
subjective (self-reported) and objective (e.g. accelerome-
ter) measures on a daily basis. It would also be important to
examine the presence of a direct or indirect link among the
intensity of symptoms associated with T2D, ego depletion,
and PA frequency.
As to the application of the knowledge presented in the
herein work into practice, we believe that some propositions
could be very useful for initiatives such as "Exercise is
Medicine" (EIM). EIM is a global health initiative managed
by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and
focuses on encouraging primary care physicians and other
health care providers to include PA when designing treat-
ment plans for patients and referring their patients to EIM
Credentialed Exercise Programs and Exercise Professionals.
Indeed, a first step toward the application of the herein sug-
gestions to practitioners or professionals involved in EIM
could consists of advising T2D adults to carefully plan their
PA practice, at moments when they will have enough
"energy" to exert self-control (e.g. not just before, during, or
right after another demanding task). Practitioners or profes-
sionals should also support their patients'autonomy, a factor
that has been found to positively influence autonomous
motivation as well as glucose control in T2D adults (Julien
et al., 2009; Williams et al., 1998), by, for instance, asking
them "Which PA would you feel the more confident and
Castonguay et al. 11
comfortable to practice?" It could also be effective to show
their patients how to recognize signs of self-regulatory fail-
ures or ego depletion, so they can learn to monitor their self-
control capacity punctually, which could help them find the
best time to engage in PA.
As outlined by this manuscript, knowledge on self-regula-
tion capacity, combined with knowledge on T2D manage-
ment, could positively influence PA practice among adults
with T2D. As previously mentioned, diabetes education pro-
grams, which require T2D adults to learn the extensive details
of diabetes management, pose a certain demand on self-regu-
latory resources, although they cover content expected to pre-
vent ego depletion (e.g. action planning). It is only once the
new information has been mastered that demands on self-
regulation diminish and that knowledge then contributes to
self-regulation. Therefore, education programs can foster a
more appropriate use of self-regulatory resources and thus
greater self-regulatory success. Consequently, we believe dia-
betes education programs should incorporate information
regarding self-regulation into their curriculum and that their
direct (i.e. learning techniques that promote self-regulation)
and indirect (pointing out which behaviors are worth modify-
ing) effects on self-regulatory skills should be evaluated. A
simple way to evaluate the impact of these education pro-
grams on self-regulatory resources and skills could consist of
a questionnaire assessing self-regulation efficiency (Neal and
Carey, 2005). Participants could complete such a question-
naire before and at the end of the diabetes education program.
Their scores could be compared to those of individuals who
did not participated in this program.
In addition to these suggestions for future research,
examining several strategies for preventing self-regulatory
failure among T2D adults in a PA participation context,
such as those presented in this work, would be worthwhile,
given there are few examples in the literature of self-regu-
lation promotion in T2D adults.
Conclusion
PA engagement requires self-regulation. This is especially
true at the beginning when one first engages in a new PA,
given the energy required to plan and weigh the pros and
cons associated with the performance of a new behavior
(Hagger and Chatzisarantis, 2009; Hagger et al., 2002,
2010a). T2D adults therefore need to use self-regulation to
integrate PA into their lives, which impedes their self-regu-
lation capacity, at least in the short term (Audiffren and
André, 2015). Cautiousness is therefore recommended as to
the amount of PA incorporated into the everyday lives of
individuals with T2D. A gradual integration, starting with
PA for as little as 10minutes per day, can have real positive
outcomes (Colberg et al., 2016; Sigal et al., 2013). Of note
is that regular aerobic PA is a core recommendation for
T2D adults given its crucial role in the management of their
condition (Colberg et al., 2016; Powers et al., 2017).
Cautiously integrating PA sessions into one's routine has
the potential to render future PA practice easier. In that
sense, initiating PA increases the possibility of entering a
loop promoting additional regular PA engagement, self-
regulation, T2D management, and overall health.
The herein work presents avenues to increase PA partici-
pation according to the primary predisposition to self-regu-
latory failure in T2D adults. It is recommended that T2D
adults, as well as their health care providers, consider their
self-regulation capacity, chronic ego depletion and its impli-
cations, and daily self-regulatory demands, including those
associated with PA participation. T2D and its management
are complex and demanding. Because failure and dropout
are not what individuals are looking for in terms of PA par-
ticipation and diabetes management, ensuring one has the
resources to integrate successfully the required new knowl-
edge, skills, and behaviors is crucial to their success.
