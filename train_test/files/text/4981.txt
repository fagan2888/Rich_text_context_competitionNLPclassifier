Introduction
The renin­angiotensin system (RAS) is comprised of
peptide hormones, enzymes, and receptors, which have a
diverse involvement in the maintenance of sodium home-
ostasis and regulation of blood pressure (BP).1,2 Recently,
RAS components have been sub-grouped as angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE)/angiotensin II (Ang II)/angio-
tensin type 1 receptor (AT1
R) and ACE2/angiotensin
(1-7) (Ang-(1-7))/Mas receptor (MasR) axes with coun-
ter regulatory functions. While ACE/Ang II/AT1
R is
known to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of vari-
ous cardiovascular diseases, kidney injury, anti-natriure-
sis, and hypertension,3­5 emerging evidence supports a
protective role for ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis in heart and
kidney function, including natriuresis and hypertension.6­10

Abstract
Introduction: Renin­angiotensin system (RAS) components exert diverse physiological functions and have been sub-
grouped into deleterious angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)/angiotensin II (Ang II)/angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1
R)
and protective ACE2/angiotensin (1-7) (Ang-(1-7))/Mas receptor (MasR) axes. We have reported that chronic activation of
angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2
R) alters RAS components and provides protection against obesity-related kidney injury.
Materials and methods: We utilized AT2
R knockout (AT2
KO) mice in this study and evaluated the renal expression
of various RAS components and examined the renal injury after placing these mice on high fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks.
Results: The cortical ACE2 activity and MasR expression were significantly decreased in AT2
KO mice compared to wild
type (WT) mice. LC/MS analysis revealed an increase in renal Ang II levels and a decrease in Ang-(1-7) levels in AT2
KO
mice. Cortical expression of ACE and AT1
R was increased but renin activity remained unchanged in AT2
KO compared
with WT mice. WT mice fed HFD exhibited increased systolic blood pressure, higher indices of kidney injury, mesangial
matrix expansion score, and microalbuminuria, which were further increased in AT2
KO mice.
Conclusion: This study suggests that deletion of AT2
R decreases the expression of the beneficial ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR
and increases the deleterious ACE/Ang II/AT1
R axis of the renal RAS in mice. Further, AT2
KO mice are more susceptible
to HFD-induced renal injury.

function. For example, AT1
R activation decreases ACE2
expression and Ang-(1-7) production11,12 leads to reduced
MasR activation and function.13,14 Such changes in the
RAS components cause a shift potentially impacting on
the functional balance between deleterious versus protec-
tive arms of the RAS.
The angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2
R) is another
component of the RAS, and has not been "particularly"
assigned to either of the RAS axes. However, numerous
studies, including some from our laboratory, have shown
that AT2
R is natriuretic, anti-hypertensive, and cardio-
and reno-protective in various animal models.8,15­18
Therefore, AT2
R may be grouped with the protective
ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis. AT2
R is termed as `func-
tional antagonist' of AT1
R.19 This notion is based on the
findings that AT2
Rs, via dimerization with AT1
R19 or cell
signaling cross-talk, attenuates AT1
-mediated cellular
responses in various cell types including the kidney epi-
thelial cells.20,21 Additionally, chronic treatment with
AT2
R agonist has been shown to cause a reduction in
AT1
R expression, another mechanism by which AT2
R can
reduce AT1
R function.22 Recently, we have reported that
long-term pharmacological stimulation of AT2
R with
preferential agonists caused a decrease in AT1
R-mediated
renal function, but increased the expression/activity of
ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis in the kidney cortex of obese
Zucker rats.8 These changes were associated with
enhanced natriuresis, lowering of BP, and decreased renal
injury in obese animals.8,16 In light of the beneficial effects
mediated by AT2
R, the present study is designed to test the
hypothesis that deletion of AT2
R (a) decreases the renal
expression of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis and increases
that of the ACE/Ang II/AT1
R axis and (b) makes the ani-
mals more susceptible to kidney injury in response to a
high fat diet (HFD). To test this hypothesis, RAS compo-
nents in the kidney cortices from AT2
KO mice and wild
type (WT) controls from a similar background were meas-
ured. To demonstrate the reno-protective effect of AT2
R,
WT and AT2
KO mice were fed either a normal fat diet or
a HFD to induce obesity-related glomerulopathy.
Materials and methods
Animals
Male AT2
R­/y (AT2
KO) mice, which were kindly pro-
vided by Tadashi Inagami (Vanderbilt University,
Nashville, Tennessee, USA) and wild type with similar
background (C57BL/6) of 20 weeks of age (purchased
from Harlan, Inc.) were used in the study. The animal
experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of
Houston. These animals were euthanized and the kidneys
were removed, washed in cold saline and kept frozen at
­80°C for measuring RAS components.
Western blotting for AT1
R and MasR
The expression of AT1
R, and MasR in the kidney cortex
was determined by western blotting. For this purpose, the
kidney cortices were homogenized in a buffer containing
(in mM) Tris 50, ethylene diaminete tra-acetic acid (EDTA)
10, Phenyl methyl sulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) 1 and pro-
tease inhibitors. Equal amounts of protein (20 g for AT1
R
and 40 g for MasR) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and
were transferred onto immobilon P (blot). The blots were
incubated with primary polyclonal antibodies for the
AT1
R, and MasR. Following incubation with the primary
antibodies, the blots were incubated with Horse radish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit Immunoglobulin
type G (IgGs). The signal was detected by Enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) system, recorded and analyzed
by Fluorchem 8800 (Alpha Innotech Imaging System, San
Leandro, California, USA) for the densitometric analysis.
The blots were stripped, and re-probed with -actin mouse
monoclonal antibody.
Renin, ACE2, and ACE activity
Renin activity in the kidney cortex was measured by
Sensolyte 520 Mouse renin and ACE2 activity was meas-
ured by Sensolyte 390 ACE2 assay kit (Anaspec Inc.,
Fremont, California, USA). The renin and ACE2 activity
was determined using Mca/Dnp fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET) peptide. In the FRET peptide the
fluorescence of Mca is quenched by Dnp, upon cleavage
into two separate fragments by the enzyme, the fluores-
cence of Mca is recovered, and is monitored at excitation/
emission at 330/390 nm for ACE2 and at 490/520 nm for
renin.ACE concentration was measured by Enzyme linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit (USCN Life Science
Inc, Texas, USA) as per manufacturer's instructions.
LC/MS quantification of angiotensin peptides
To determine angiotensin peptide levels quantitatively in
the kidney cortex, tissue was homogenized in lysis buffer
(10 mM Tris, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors. The angio-
tensin peptides were then analyzed by LC/MS method as
described in our earlier publication.23,24
Diet-induced obesity protocol
Male WT and AT2
KO mice (four weeks old) were placed
either on normal diet or HFD for 16 weeks to induce obesity.
The HFD feed Teklad custom research diet (TD.06414)
with adjusted calorie diet (60/Fat) containing 18.4% protein,
21.3% carbohydrate and 60.3% fat, and normal diet 7022
(code of normal diet) with isocaloric 29% protein, 56% car-
bohydrate and 15% fat were purchased from Harlan,
Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. Both diets contained similar
mineral mix AIN-93G-MX (94046) and vitamin mix
Ali et al. 3
AIN93-VX (94047). The animals were individually housed
in metabolic cages during the last week of diet administra-
tion to collect urine. At the end of the 16-week treatment,
the mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation under iso-
flurane anesthesia following six hours of fasting. Each left
kidney was fixed in formalin for histological analyses.
Renal histology and morphometry
The formalin-fixed tissue was embedded in paraffin and 4
m sections were prepared. The slides were further stained
with Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) reagents or Masson's tri-
chrome stain (Dako North America, Inc.) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. All tissue samples were eval-
uated independently by two investigators in a blinded fash-
ion by light microscopy (×400). For each animal, 30
glomeruli from each of the three consecutive sections were
assessed. A semi-quantitative scoring method described by
Raij et al.25 was used to evaluate the degree of damage to
the glomeruli. This was graded according to the severity of
the glomerular damage: 0, normal; 1, slight glomerular
damage of the mesangial matrix and/or hyalinosis with
focal adhesion involving <25% of the glomerulus; 2, scle-
rosis of 25% to 50%; 3, sclerosis of 50% to 75%; and 4,
sclerosis >75% of the glomerulus. A mesangial matrix
expansion (MME) score was assigned in a similar manner
on a scale of 0­4 depending upon the area of the glomeru-
lus occupied by mesangial matrix when compared to lean
control glomeruli. The glomerulosclerosis index or mesan-
gial score was calculated by averaging the grades assigned
to all glomeruli fields using the formula:
sclerosis index MME score
N1 1 N2 2 N3 3 N4 4
/
/
=
× + × + × + ×
( ) n
where N1­N4 represent the number of glomeruli with the
respective score, n is the total number of glomeruli.
Measurement of microalbuminuria
An indirect competitive ELISA kit (Exocell, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, USA) was used to measure urinary albumin
excretion according to the manufacturer's instructions.
BP
BP was measured by tail-cuff method using CODA system
which is clinically validated and provides 99% correlation
with telemetry and direct BP measurements.26,27 The CODA
tail-cuff BP system utilizes volume pressure recording (VPR)
sensor technology to measure the mouse tail BP. BP was
measured during the last two weeks (three days in each week
with three readings each day on each animal) of the feeding
regimen. For each animal, the data for each animal was aver-
aged and treated as one value, which was used to calculate
mean±standard error of the mean (SEM).
Chemicals and reagents
Antibodies for MasR and  Actin were purchased from
Alomone Labs Ltd, Israel and Santa Cruz, California, USA
respectively.AT1
Rantibodywascustomraised(Biomolecular
Integration, Arizona, USA). Standards for Ang II and Ang-
(1-7) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, St Louis,
Missouri, USA. All other chemicals were of standard grade.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean±SEM and were analyzed using
GraphPad Prism 4 and subjected to t-test. n=5­6 in each
group, as detailed in figure legends. A p value of less than
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Effect of deletion of AT2

ACE2, Ang-(1-7) and MasR. The cortical ACE2 activity (Fig-
ure 1(a)) was significantly reduced (WT: 113±8, AT2
KO:
41±11, RFU/min) in AT2
KO mice. The LC/MS quantifica-
tion of angiotensin peptides revealed that the levels of Ang-
(1-7) (Figure 1(b)) was also significantly reduced (WT:
33±5, AT2
KO: 14±02.8 fmoles/mg tissue) in the kidney cor-
tex of AT2

mice (Figure 1(c)).

kidney cortex (WT: 31±2.7, AT2
KO: 47±2.7 fmoles/mg tis-
sue). Western blot of AT1
R at 41 kDa revealed almost a two-
fold increase in the kidney cortex of AT2
KO compared to
WT mice (Figure 2(c)).
Renin.Renin activity in the kidney cortex remained
unchanged between wild type and AT2
KO mice (Figure 3).
Effect of deletion of AT2
R on renal injury
Markers of early renal injury.Renal sections were stained
with PAS to assess glomerular injury. Early pathological
changes, including glomerular hypertrophy, mesangial
expansion, and basement membrane thickening, were
observed in WT and AT2
KO mice maintained on the HFD
while the renal morphology of ND-fed WT and AT2
KO
mice was normal (Figure 4(a) and (b)). MME scores were
higher in HFD-fed AT2
KO mice compared to WT mice
fed the HFD (Figure 4(a) and (b)). Masson's trichrome
stain was used to evaluate tubulointerstitial collagen depo-
sition. No tubulointerstitial fibrosis was detected in any of
the treatment groups (data not shown). WT mice on HFD

excreted increased amounts of albumin in the urine, and
lack of AT2
R in HFD-fed mice modestly increased the uri-
nary albumin excretion (Figure 4(c)). The urinary albumin
excretion was within normal values in WT and AT2
KO
mice on ND (Figure 4(c)).
Effect of deletion of AT2
R on systolic BP. As shown in Figure
5, systolic BP in AT2
KO on normal diet was modestly but
significantly higher compared to WT. High fat diet signifi-
cantly increased systolic BP in both WT andAT2
KO. How-
ever, the BP levels were similar in WT HFD and AT2
KO
HFD mice.
Discussion
The most notable finding of the current study is that AT2
R
deficient mice expressed a decreased level ofACE2/Ang-(1-
7)/MasR while ACE/Ang II/AT1
R increased in the kidney
cortex. This shift in the balance of RAS components resulted
in greater susceptibility to obesity-induced renal injury,
which highlights the critical role of AT2
R in regulating renal
RAS components and exerting reno-protective effects.
ACE2 is an important RAS enzyme which converts
Ang II to Ang-(1-7). Similar to AT2
R, Ang-(1-7) via the
MasR, can oppose the actions of Ang II mediated via
AT1
R28­31 and can exert vasodilatation, natriuresis, and
reno-protection. It has been shown that stimulation of
MasR inhibits the AT1
R-mediated regulation of ERK1/2
activity,32 a critical enzyme involved in cell growth and
tissue remodeling under various pathological conditions.
MasR is considered reno-protective, and blockade or dele-
tion of this receptor has been shown to cause reduced
natriuresis, increased proteinuria, and reduced renal blood
flow.33­35 AT1
R expression in the kidney is markedly
increased along with reduced glomerular tuft diameter,
increased collagen and fibronectin in MasR knockout

mice.33 These findings suggest that MasR activation not
only opposes the actions mediated by AT1
R, but the levels
of MasR may inversely influence the expression of AT1
R.
Adding to this RAS inter-regulatory complexity, we dem-
onstrate for the first time that deletion of AT2
R decreases
ACE2 activity, MasR expression, and decreases Ang-(1-7)
levels in the kidney cortex of mice. Moreover, consistent
with other reports,36,37 we also observed that deletion of
AT2
R significantly increased AT1
R expression in the kid-
ney cortex. Additionally, Ang II levels were also elevated
in the kidney cortex of AT2
KO mice.
The inter-regulatory role of AT2
R in the two arms of
RAS seems to be complex but can be plausibly explained.
The enhanced AT1
R expression in AT2
KO mice kidney
could be a result of the reduced expression on MasR in
these animals, as earlier study has shown that deletion of
MasR causes an increase in the AT1
R expression.33
Subsequently, it is likely that the increase in AT1

expression and activation by higher Ang II concentration,
as observed in this study, causes a reduction in ACE2
expression and activity leading to the reduced Ang-(1-7)
production. Earlier studies have shown such relationship
in that Ang II via activation of AT1
R causes a reduction in
ACE2 expression and activity, thus reduces Ang-(1-7) pro-
duction in cardiac myocytes.11 However, we have recently
reported that the AT2
R activation may have direct positive
regulation of ACE2 expression and activity, without the
involvement of AT1
Rs.8 Thus it's likely that AT2
R may
have a direct as well as indirect role in regulating the pro-
tective and deleterious arms of the RAS. However, sys-
temic studies are needed to delineate the role of AT2
R in
regulating various RAS components.
The functional relevance of AT2
R deletion and of the
shift in the two arms of the RAS was studied in animals
subjected to high fat diet, which is known to cause renal
injury. As expected HFD fed WT mice developed renal
injury evidenced by MME and microalbuminuria in these
animals. However, AT2
KO mice on HFD developed

greater renal injury, suggesting a protective role of AT2
R.
Since AT2
KO per se had no changes in MME and microal-
buminuria, it could be argued that AT2
R-mediated protec-
tion occurs only under pathogenic conditions, such as
obesity. This notion is further supported by other studies,38
including ours,16 which show that pharmacological activa-
tion of AT2
R protects against nephropathy in obese rats
and diabetic animal models and had no injurious effects in
normal animals. Hypertension is a known risk factor for
renal injury.39 It is likely that the injury in HFD fed WT
mice was related to elevated BPin these animals. However,
AT2
KO mice on HFD had similar elevated BP as WT
HFD, yet exhibited greater renal injury, suggesting
BP-independent protection by AT2
R. This AT2
R-mediated
protection could be related to its anti-oxidative stress and
anti-inflammatory activity, as reported recently.16,40
Consistent with a previous study,41 AT2
KO mice had mod-
est elevation in BP, which had no significant impact on
kidney structure and albuminuria. In the present study we
found an imbalance of RAS components with AT2
KO
without alteration in mesangial area and albuminuria.
Although the levels of renal Ang II and AT1
R were
increased, this may not be enough to induce kidney injury
and MME. In a recent study, Kim et al.,42 demonstrated
that even onset of early chronic kidney disease in an exper-
imental model is not sufficient to cause glomerular injury
or collagen deposition. This suggests that a simple increase
in a deleterious RAS component may not lead to kidney
damage. Indeed, we have recently shown that obese rats
treated with high salt leads to increase in superoxide via
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate- oxidase
(NOX) and increased oxidative stress in kidney.43
Superoxide can directly affect the glomerular barrier and
increases Na reabsorption leading to hypertension and
renal injury in obese rats and Dahl salt sensitive rats.
Further, activation ofAT2
R by the non-peptide agonist C21
reduces the Ang II level, expression of p47phox-NOX
subunit, superoxide formation and salt-sensitive rise in
BP,22,43 but had no effects on Ang II levels or oxidative
stress in obese rats treated with normal diet.8 This suggests
that the adverse effect of AT2
R deletion can be seen only
under pathogenic conditions. The limitation of this study is
the fact that we did not design this study to assess renal or
plasma components of RAS in AT2
KO HFD mice, there-
fore it is unclear whether RAS components have changed
in response to HFD per se and whether those changes
might have further contributed to the renal injury inAT2
KO
mice. However, collectively our data highlights the impor-
tance of AT2
R under pathogenic conditions, such as obe-
sity, where it plays a protective role. The contribution of
various components of the RAS in the face of opposing
changes in obesity warrants a detailed systematic study.
In summary, we observed that deletion of AT2
R caused
an elevation in renal ACE/Ang-II/AT1
R and reduction in
ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR expression leading to a shift from
beneficial to deleterious axis of RAS. Thus, owing to the
beneficial role of renal AT2
R, it could be considered as a
potentially important therapeutic target in preventing obe-
sity related renal injury.
