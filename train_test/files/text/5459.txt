Student and teacher talk plays a crucial role in teaching and
learning in classroom settings. Spoken language is the cen-
tral medium by which teachers teach (Cazden, 2001) and,
arguably, the primary means by which students learn as
"speech makes available to reflection the processes by which
[students] relate new knowledge to old" (Barnes, 1974, as
cited in Cazden, 2001, p. 2). "From Socrates to Dewey to
Habermas, educative dialogue has represented a forum for
learners to develop understanding by listening, reflecting,
proposing, and incorporating alternative views" (Michaels,
O'Connor, & Resnick, 2008, p. 284). Language is also an
important part of what students learn as they master the lin-
guistic conventions of various disciplines like history, sci-
ence, and social studies as well as the formal, academic
language that marks students' identities as educated persons
(Schleppegrell, 2004).
Much of the literature on language in classrooms focuses
on discussion that is seen "as much a method of instruction
as . . . a curriculum outcome. As a method [discussion] pro-
vides an approach for teaching content, while as an outcome
or goal of instruction it emphasizes that students become
competent discussants" (Larson, 1997, p. 207). Mercer and
Howe (2012) conclude that "when teachers actively engage
students in reflective discussions of what they are studying,
this helps them learn, develops their understanding and pre-
pares them well for independent learning" (p. 14). Brookfield
and Preskill (2005) argue that discussion transforms students
into "cocreators of knowledge" (p. 22). In the context of dia-
logue, "the group constructs and discloses deeper meaning,
enriching understanding for all participants" (Eeds & Wells,
1991, p. 134). In addition, discussion may lead to more inter-
est in "interdisciplinary and connected learning" (Cox &
Richlin, 1993, p. 3). In general, advocates for discussion
have argued that discussion will motivate students to learn,
engage students in higher level thinking, increase class
morale, give feedback to teachers, and develop more positive
student attitudes toward instruction (Barnes & Ellner, 1983;
Crone, 2001).
A significant body of research has accumulated on how
discussion methods are used in K-12 classrooms and how
discussion supports learning in a range of school subjects
(Michaels et al., 2008). There is, for example, a body of evi-
dence indicating that "academically rigorous discussions"
(Michaels et al., 2008) positively affect academic perfor-
mance in language arts (Beck, McKeowan, Hamilton, &
Kucan, 1997; Goldenberg, 1993; Lee, 2001), mathematics
(Chapin, O'Connor, & Anderson, 2003; Lampert & Ball,
1998), high school physics (Minstrell, 1989), and elementary
(Warren & Rosebery, 1996) and middle school science
(Sohmer, 2000). Despite the promise of classroom discus-
sions, teacher talk dominates in elementary and secondary
classrooms (Cazden, 2001), and discussion as a form of

Discussion in Postsecondary Classrooms:
A Review of the Literature
Curt Dudley-Marling1
Abstract
Spoken language is, arguably, the primary means by which teachers teach and students learn. Much of the literature on
language in classrooms has focused on discussion that is seen as both a method of instruction and a curricular outcome.
While much of the research on discussion has focused on K-12 classrooms, there is also a body of research examining the
efficacy of discussion in postsecondary settings. This article provides a review of this literature in order to consider the effect
of discussion on student learning in college and university classrooms, the prevalence of discussion in postsecondary settings,
and the quality of discussion in these settings. In general, the results of research on the efficacy of discussion in postsecondary
settings are mixed. More seriously, researchers have not been explicit about the meaning of discussion and much of what
is called discussion in this body of research is merely recitation with minimal levels of student participation. Although the
research on discussion in college and university classrooms is inconclusive, some implications can be drawn from this review
of the research including the need for future researchers to clearly define what they mean by "discussion."

classroom interaction may be rare (McCann, Johannessen,
Kahn, & Flanagan, 2006).
In addition to research on talk in K-12 settings, there is a
large and growing literature promoting the benefits of dis-
cussion in postsecondary classrooms. Rocca (2010), for
example, observes that discussion may promote learning in
postsecondary classrooms by actively involving students in
the college learning experience. Hardman and Mroz (1999)
conclude that discussion gives students a means to draw on
the knowledge and experience that they bring to their courses
giving them more responsibility for and control over their
learning. In general, many postsecondary educators view
discussion as an alternative to lecture that is seen as encour-
aging passive acceptance of factual information rather than
deep engagement with ideas (Steen, Bader, & Kubrin, 1999;
Windschitl, 1999).
The purpose of this article is to review the published
research on the effects of discussion in college and university
classrooms with particular attention to research examining
the quality and quantity of discussion in postsecondary set-
tings and its effect on student learning.
I begin by describing the process by which I identified
studies for inclusion in this review.
Method
To locate relevant reports of research on discussion in col-
lege and university classrooms, I did multiple searches of the
Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) database
using the following Descriptors:
·
· Discussion (teaching technique) and Higher Education
·
· Discussion (teaching technique) and Postsecondary
Education
This search strategy identified articles in peer-reviewed
journals that examined discussion in 2-year colleges and
undergraduate and graduate settings including law and medi-
cal schools. I augmented this ERIC search with a compre-
hensive search of the tables of contents of major higher
education journals including the Journal on Excellence in
College Teaching, College Teaching, Innovative Higher
Education, and the Journal of Higher Education. I also
located relevant articles and book chapters by scanning the
reference sections of each article I identified. From this pool
of articles, I selected for review only journal articles and
book chapters that reported research on discussion in post-
secondary settings. I excluded from this review research
studies of online discussions. In all, I located 50 articles and
book chapters reporting research on discussion in postsec-
ondary settings (2-year and 4-year colleges, graduate classes,
medical and law school) including three previously con-
ducted reviews, two focusing more generally on research on
college teaching (Birney & McKeachie, 1955; McKeachie,
1990), and one focusing on participation in college and
university classrooms (Rocca, 2010).
Findings
After multiple readings of summaries of each of the 50 arti-
cles included in this review, I identified the following themes
around which this review is organized:
·
· The effect of discussion on student learning
·
· The effect of discussion on student participation and
engagement
·
· The quality of discussions in college classrooms
I discuss each of these themes in turn below.
The Effect of Discussion on Student Learning
I located 31 research studies that examined, directly or indi-
rectly, the effect of discussion on student learning. The first
group of studies reviewed below employed various means to
assess directly the effects of discussion on student learning
including the effect of discussion on student writing. A sec-
ond group of studies assessed student learning indirectly
through the use of students' perceptions of the effect of dis-
cussions on their learning.
Effect of discussion on measures of student achievement.The
most potent argument for discussion in postsecondary class-
rooms is its potential for boosting student achievement
(Rocca, 2010) by engaging students in higher levels of learn-
ing (Wade, 1994). Indeed, there is some evidence supporting
the claim that discussion positively affects student learning
in college classrooms. Harton, Richardson, Barreras, Rockl-
off, and Latane (2002), for example, examined the impact of
an approach to discussion called "Focused Interactive Learn-
ing" (FIL) on student achievement in five undergraduate
psychology classes. While in class students responded in
writing to sets of multiple-choice and opinion questions and
then discussed their answers for 1 to 2 min with other stu-
dents. Occasionally, this was followed by whole-class dis-
cussions. These discussions were undertaken for every other
chapter in the psychology textbook and, overall, students
performed better on end-of-chapter test items they had dis-
cussed than on chapters they had not discussed.
de Grave, Schmidt, and Boshuizen (2001) also reported a
positive effect for discussion on student achievement. Forty-
eight first-year medical students were assigned to either an
experimental group that participated in a problem-based dis-
cussion of blood pressure regulation prior to reading a chap-
ter on this topic or to a control group that participated in a
discussion of a problem of vision before reading the chapter
on blood pressure regulation. Students in the blood pressure
regulation group recalled 25% more information from the
text than control group students who had not discussed blood
pressure regulation.
Other researchers have found similar effects for discus-
sion. Christianson and Fisher (1999) reported that students
enrolled in a discussion/laboratory biology class, compared
Dudley-Marling 3
to students enrolled in large lecture/laboratory classes, devel-
oped a deeper understanding of osmosis and diffusion.
Similarly, Lyon and Lagowski (2008) found that students in
a general chemistry class who volunteered to participate in
small discussion groups outperformed students who did not
participate in these groups on course examinations and final
grades. Birney and McKeachie (1955) reported that students
taught by discussion generally achieved superior perfor-
mance on measures of thinking, retention after the final
exam, motivation, and attitude change.
Positive effects for discussion go beyond exam scores and
course grades. Josten (1996), for instance, examined the
effect of discussion on the reading comprehension of
80 "developmental readers" in a 2-year college setting. One
week before the final exam, some sections of the course used
traditional highlighting and recitation to address a text and
the other sections used an inquiry­based, decision-making
process as a guide for student-led discussions of the same
reading. At the end of these sessions, students were asked to
write everything they could remember about the topic of the
reading/discussion and respond to eight prompted recall
questions requiring various levels of thinking. Josten con-
cluded that, although the combined scores for the discussion
and control groups were not significantly different, the sec-
tions of those instructors Josten deemed to have adequately
prepared to lead the discussions performed significantly bet-
ter than the control group. This finding suggests that not just
any sort of discussion will be effective, an issue addressed in
greater detail below.
Levin (1995) reported that discussion was a "crucial vari-
able" in in-service teachers' ability to learn from case stud-
ies. Experimental and control conditions each consisted of
12 teachers subdivided into two groups of six teachers. All
groups read and wrote about a case and then read and wrote
about the same case a second time several weeks later.
Between these two events, the experimental group partici-
pated in a discussion of the case study. The second time they
wrote about the cases, teachers in the discussion group, com-
pared to the teachers in the control group, elaborated on their
original thinking, displaying changes in their understanding
of the case study. Levin concluded that teachers in the con-
trol group failed to present any new ideas or insights after
their second reading of the case.
In a related study of pre-service teachers, Copeland and
Decker (1996) reported that students who discussed video
cases in groups of three were somewhat more effective
adopting, transforming, or creating new ways of making
meaning of the vignettes they worked with over one third of
the time. However, since there was no control group, it is not
clear if other approaches to reviewing case studies would
have been equally effective. Bolt (1998) also reported an
improvement in physical education students' "general pro-
pensity to identify problems and propose solutions" (p. 96)
when they participated in case study discussions.
Discussion has also been found to positively affect stu-
dent writing. Hewett (2000) compared the influence of in-
class and online discussions on students' revision of their
writing. Hewett collected data from two sections of the same
course, one a "traditional oral classroom" and the other a
"networked computer classroom." Discussion in both envi-
ronments focused primarily on students'writing although the
discussion in each setting had different characteristics. Oral
talk, for instance, was more focused on abstract, global idea
development, whereas discussion in the online environment
focused more on concrete writing issues and management.
Despite these differences, students in both environments
used ideas generated during discussions to revise their writ-
ing. No evidence was offered about the effectiveness of these
revisions, however.
While the studies reviewed above support the efficacy of
discussion in postsecondary classrooms, other researchers
have found discussion to be no more effective--and some-
times less effective--than other pedagogical approaches.
Liefeld and Herrmann (2002), for example, compared two
sections of a consumer studies course. Both sections did the
same readings and both sections participated in class presen-
tations and lectures, but one section spent 1 hr per week in
discussions of class readings. The other section did not par-
ticipate in discussions but instead took and retook quizzes
based on course readings to the point of mastery. The
researchers created a 60-item test based on course readings
for pre- and post-tests. Students in both groups performed at
significantly higher levels on the post-test; however, the
mean score of the mastery-testing group was significantly
higher on the post-test than the mean score of the seminar-
discussion group.
Garside (1996) found that discussion was no more effec-
tive at promoting student learning than lecture in six sections
of an undergraduate interpersonal relations course. Half of
the sections were assigned to a lecture condition and half to
a discussion condition in which small groups of students
responded to questions provided by the instructor through
discussion. The intervention was limited to a single class
meeting. Based on a test of course content, including ques-
tions deemed to require high and low levels of critical think-
ing, the lecture condition produced significant learning from
pre-test to post-test with regard to the total score, lower-level
items, and higher-level items. Discussion produced more
learning from pre-test to post-test only with regard to higher-
level items. Although both the discussion and lecture condi-
tions produced gains in student learning from the pre-test to
post-test, there were no significant differences in the post-
test scores of the two groups.
Stone (1997) also reported that discussion was no more or
less effective than lecture for acquiring information pre-
sented during a museum tour. Six intact college art education
classes were assigned randomly to one of the three condi-
tions: a lecture condition, an inquiry/discussion tour, and a
4 SAGE Open
control group. In both treatment conditions, students were
given factual information, but in the discussion groups, stu-
dents were encouraged to ask questions and make comments
to which the guides responded to with remarks and/or que-
ries. The dependent measures included a multiple choice pre-
test and two post-tests, one given immediately after the tour
and another 3 weeks later. Based on comparisons of the pre-
and post-test conditions, Stone concluded that students in
both intervention groups did significantly better than the
control group in the post-test condition, but neither group did
well on retention as measured by the second post-test.
Bobby et al. (2012) compared the performance of stu-
dents who were asked to reformulate multiple-choice ques-
tions in a biochemistry module individually and in small
discussion groups. Although students' gains from the indi-
vidual task and the small-group discussions were substantial,
there was no advantage for either the individual or small-
group discussion conditions, and this was true for various
categories of students (low achievers, medium achievers,
high achievers).
Two widely cited studies from the 1950s, Eglash (1954)
and Guetzkow, Kelly, and McKeachie (1954), also reported
no advantage for discussion over other pedagogical
approaches. Eglash (1954), for example, examined two sec-
tions of a course taught by the same instructor, one organized
around small and large discussion group, the other taught
through lecture. No differences were found in the achieve-
ment of the two groups. Guetzkow et al. (1954) compared
the effect of three instructional approaches: drill-recitation,
group discussion, and study tutorial. All students experi-
enced a common lecture, used the same textbook, and were
given the identical assignments. Teaching methods differed
only in weekly supplemental sections. There were no signifi-
cant differences between the groups in terms of educational
achievement.
The research on the efficacy of discussion in postsecond-
ary settings is decidedly mixed. However, the research
reviewed above focuses mainly on student performance on
traditional quizzes and exams and, in this context, discussion
may be no more or less effective than other pedagogical
approaches. Proponents of discussion argue that discussion
has the potential to engage students in higher levels of think-
ing and critical reflection (e.g., Auster & MacRone, 1994;
Crabtree, Royeen, & Mu, 2001; Wade, 1994) as well as pro-
viding fertile ground for collaborative meaning making
(Eeds & Wells, 1991; Townsend & Pace, 2005). The tradi-
tional assessments utilized in the studies reviewed above
may not be sensitive to these outcomes accounting for the
mixed results.
A few studies do suggest that discussion is an effective
means for stimulating higher forms of student learning.
Haroutunian-Gordon and Tartakoff (1996) routinely engaged
students enrolled in a course on problem solving in mathe-
matics and music in an approach called "interpretive discus-
sion" in which discussion focused on evidentiary-based
claims in response to open-ended questions. Haroutunian-
Gordon and Tartakoff's qualitative analysis of discussion
transcripts shows students engaged in high-level mathemati-
cal thinking. No claim is made that discussion was the cause
of this high-level thinking; the authors argue, however, that
interpretive discussion provided the context within which
this kind of thinking occurred.
Lehman and Scharer (1996) found that discussion affected
the quality of pre-service and in-service teachers' interpreta-
tions of texts (as opposed to simple recall of textual informa-
tion). Students were asked to read a piece of young adult
fiction and record their responses to the text in writing as
they read. They were then asked to participate in whole-class
discussions of the text. Following the discussion, both pre-
service and in-service teachers' (n = 129) text-based
responses to the text were judged by the researchers to be
"more analytical, inferential, and evaluative in relation to the
literary textual elements" (p. 31).
Self, Baldwin, and Olivarez (1993) used a test of moral
reasoning (arguably a form of higher-level thinking) to assess
the effectiveness of a film-discussion course for medical stu-
dents designed to develop "more humanistic, compassionate,
and caring physicians" (p. 383). The researchers reported
significant differences in posttest scores between a group
that took the course for two semesters and a control group
that did not take the course but not between a group of stu-
dents that took the course for only one semester and the con-
trol group. Unfortunately, because of the design of the study,
the only conclusion that can be drawn is that a course that
included films and discussion taken for two semesters was
better at improving medical students' performance on a test
of moral reasoning than taking no course at all.
Like research on the efficacy of discussion in general,
research on the efficacy of discussion as a means of promot-
ing higher levels of thinking is mixed. Thyer, Jackson-White,
Sutphen, and Carrillo (1992) examined student performance
in two graduate classes in social work. One class responded
in writing to study questions based on the following week's
readings and then presented their answers in class. The other
class was taught through a structured teaching method called
"learning through discussion" (p. 239) where each student
was responsible for presenting a summary of readings to the
class as a means of stimulating discussion. Based on student
performance on an "essay-type" test, the authors reported
that students in the study question group made significantly
higher gains on their scores for the critical analysis assign-
ment compared to the structured discussion group. Also, as
summarized above, Garside (1996) found discussion no
more (or less) effective than lecture in improving student
performance on test items deemed to require higher levels of
thinking.
Student perceptions of classroom discussion in college class-
rooms.A number of researchers have used student percep-
tions as an indirect measure of the efficacy of discussion in
Dudley-Marling 5
postsecondary classrooms. Windschitl (1999), for example,
persuaded two science instructors to include brief, small-
group discussions in their classes around questions that did
not have "single discrete answers that could be recalled or
generated quickly . . . but rather the questions would encour-
age elaborated higher-order thinking" (p. 23). Discussions
average approximately 5 min. At the end of the semester, stu-
dents were asked to respond to several statements (e.g., "the
small group discussion questions helped my understanding
of the lecture material" [p. 25]) using a 5-point Likert-type
scale. Students indicated that, while they felt that the discus-
sions supported their learning, 5 min was insufficient for
meaningful discussion.
Wade (1994) used interviews and a questionnaire to
explore undergraduate education majors' beliefs and atti-
tudes toward class discussion. Students indicated that they
learned from discussions but, again, many students believed
that not all professors provided sufficient time for in-depth
discussions. Other researchers also report favorable response
to discussions. Based on a 10-item survey and focus group
interviews, Randall (2009) reported that students in a course
on adolescence believed that literature circle discussions
increased their understanding of literature, in part by allow-
ing them to hear the perspectives of other students. Brazeau,
Hughes, and Prokai (1999) found that students in a first-year
pharmacy course generally liked small-group, case-based
discussions and believed that these discussions supported
learning although they felt that 50 min was insufficient to
achieve all the goals the instructor had set out for the discus-
sions. Crabtree et al. (2001) reported that students in an
occupational therapy course indicated that an approach
called "learning through discussion" led them to think criti-
cally about issues raised in the course. Crabtree et al. noted,
however, that at least one of the students in the course was
highly critical of the "learning through discussion" process.
Jensen and Owen (2010), drawing on a data set that included
students enrolled in introductory economics courses from
34 universities, concluded that, overall, students preferred
classes with less lecture and more discussion and that classes
with more discussion were, from the students' perspective,
more likely to encourage them to take economics course-
work in the future. Other researchers have also reported that
students indicated that in-class discussions made their
courses more interesting (Josten, 1996) and enhanced their
learning (Finkel, 1999; Hamann, Pollock, & Wilson, 2012).
There is also some evidence, based on student percep-
tions, that discussions may have a positive effect on students'
oral and written communication skills. Based on an end-of-
course survey of second-term MBA students, Dallimore,
Hertenstein, and Platt (2008) concluded that the students felt
that participation in discussions improved their oral and writ-
ten communication skills while enhancing their learning
overall and generally increasing their confidence.
Based on focus group interviews with 43 sophomores and
juniors Roehling, Vander Kooi, Dykema, Quisenberry, and
Vandlen (2011) identified three main reasons that students
valued discussions. From the students' perspective, discus-
sions made learning more active, resulting in deeper under-
standing and promoting perspective taking. Not all students
have been entirely positive about discussion, however.
Eglash (1954), for example, found that students in a lecture-
only section of a course--compared to students in a discus-
sion section--had more favorable attitudes toward the
course. Although there were no differences in achievement
between the two sections, Eglash reported unfavorable com-
ments from students in the discussion section including the
assertion that the reliance on discussion amounted to an abdi-
cation of instructor responsibility. Harton et al. (2002)
reported that, while students were relatively positive about a
"focused interactive learning" approach to discussion, they
felt that this approach had more of an effect on interpersonal
relations than their learning despite the evidence presented
above that students performed better on end-of-chapter test
items they had discussed than on chapters they had not dis-
cussed. Faw (1949) also found that, while students indicated
a preference for "student-centered" discussions, two thirds of
students who participated in these discussions expressed res-
ervations about the intellectual rigor of this approach despite
the finding that these students outperformed students
assigned to non-discussion groups on course examinations.
Summary and discussion. Overall, the research on the efficacy
of discussion in college classrooms is mixed. Students gener-
ally perceive discussions as beneficial to their learning. The
only two studies reviewed here that reported negative per-
ceptions of discussions in postsecondary settings were con-
ducted over 50 years ago, at a time when students may have
had very different sensibilities about discussion. There is
also a body of research reviewed here indicating a positive
impact of discussion on academic achievement. However, a
number of studies also found no advantage for discussion
compared to other pedagogical approaches. Some studies do
show that discussion positively affects higher levels of think-
ing and problem solving, but, again, the findings are contra-
dictory. Still, the majority of studies (65%) examining the
effects of discussion on measures of student learning reported
positive effects. These proportions generally hold for studies
of small- and large-group discussions (see Table 1 for a sum-
mary of studies summarized in this section).
The research on discussion in postsecondary settings is
further complicated by methodological problems that
plague many of the studies reviewed here. Small sample
sizes, unmatched comparison groups, measures of student
learning that lack any proven validity or reliability, lack of
control groups, and potential researcher biases undermine
the claims that are made about the effect of discussion on
student achievement. Most serious of all, with the excep-
tion of a few studies, researchers have been virtually silent
on what they mean by "discussion" (see Table 1) making it
difficult to make any sort of generalized claims about

claims about the effects of discussion on student achieve-
ment because researchers have generally not been clear
about what they mean by discussion.

The Effect of Discussion on Student Participation
and Engagement
Based on her review of the literature on participation in post-
secondary classrooms, Rocca (2010) concluded that higher
levels of student participation lead to improved learning out-
comes, increased student motivation, and engagement in
"higher levels of thinking, including interpretation, analysis,
and synthesis" (p. 188).
Rocca argues that discussion is a powerful means for
increasing student participation and engagement and, ulti-
mately, student learning; yet, only two of studies reviewed in
this section directly considered whether discussion led to
increased student participation. Francisco, Nicoll, and
Trautmann (1998) examined the effect of four different
teaching methods--cooperative learning, discussion, con-
cept mapping, and lecture--in a chemistry course with
94 students. Each type of teaching was integrated with lec-
tures over the course of the semester. Students perceived
higher levels of participation during the discussion format.
The researchers offered no objective measure of "participa-
tion," however. Hardman and Mroz (1999) worked with four
college instructors to implement "recitation-breaking" strat-
egies designed to facilitate interactive discussions. These
teachers were able to create "space in the [classroom] dis-
course for the students to elaborate on their ideas" (p. 290)
that, the researchers concluded, led to higher levels of stu-
dent participation.
Despite the arguments favoring discussion in postsecond-
ary classes, the available research indicates that discussion in
postsecondary classrooms is fairly rare and, when faculty do
provide opportunities for discussion, relatively few students
tend to participate. For example, based on surveys of eco-
nomics faculty in 1995, 2001, and 2005, Watts and Becker
(2008) reported that, as of 2005, on average, 83% of class
time in economics courses was spent on lecture. Watts and
Becker note, however, a slight movement over the years
toward what they referred to as "instructor-student" discus-
sions. Discussions among students ("Student-student" dis-
cussion) were much rarer. Similarly, Nunn (1996), based on
observations of 20 upper-level social science courses,
reported that, on average, less than 1 min of class time was
devoted to any form of student talk, although there was con-
siderable variation across classes with 15 classes spending
between 1% and 9% of instructional time on student talk and
two classes spending between 20% and 23% of instructional
time on student talk. It is unclear how much of this talk quali-
fied as discussion. Benzing and Christ (1997), in a survey of
over 200 economics professors across the United States,
found that 14% of faculty indicated using class discussion
"all the time," 24% "very often," 24% "often," 33% "some-
times," and 5% "never." Most of the respondents indicated
that they had begun incorporating more discussion into their
classrooms over the previous 5 years although, again, the
meaning of discussion is not clear. Jensen and Owen (2010),
based on their analysis of data from economics classes at 34
universities, observed that postsecondary educators have
been generally reluctant to abandon lecture in favor of more
discussion. Opportunities to participate in class discussions
may differ across disciplines, however. Based on a linguistic
analysis of interactions in 196 classes in 130 university
courses, Csomay (2005) concluded that students in Education
courses were most likely to be given opportunities to partici-
pate in discussions in their classes while Engineering stu-
dents were least likely to have opportunities for discussion.
Even when given the opportunity, many students still do
not participate in classroom discussions. Rocca (2010) cites
an abundance of research indicating that relatively few stu-
dents participate regularly in their courses even when offered
the opportunity, and many students do not participate at all.
Students may be more willing to participate in smaller classes
than large ones, however. This finding is supported by Nunn
(1996) who, based on observations, field notes, and observa-
tional checklists in 20 upper-level undergraduate courses,
determined that only about one quarter of students partici-
pated in discussions. There was a wide range of participation
across the classes ranging from a class in which there was
"no participation" to four classes in which participation in
discussion ranged from 40% to 63% of the students.Asurvey
of students in these same classes indicated that approxi-
mately half of the students reported that they participated in
class discussions infrequently or never. Foster (1981), on the
other hand, found high levels of participation among third-
year medical students in small, "clinical discussion groups."
Over the course of 62 small-group sessions, all but 4 of 119
students participated in small-group discussion suggesting
that high-achieving medical students are willing to partici-
pate in class discussions.
A number of researchers have attempted to identify factors
that account for students'reluctance to participate in class dis-
cussions. Based on a survey and focus group interviews of
400 second-year social work students, Hyde and Ruth (2002)
concluded that shyness and lack of preparation were the main
reasons students chose not to participate in class discussions.
Other research suggests that race and gender may also affect
student participation in class discussions. Kaufmann (2010),
for example, found that whole class discussions in an ethnic
studies course tended to be dominated by White females
while working-class students of color were likely to feel
silenced. In her review, Rocca (2010) found that females were
less likely to engage in any form of class participation--
including discussion--than males. Based on a survey of stu-
dents for 51 courses at a private, Midwestern university,
Fassinger (1995) reported that males saw themselves as
more confident and more involved in class discussions while
females saw themselves as more prepared for class, more
interested in the subject matter, and more interested in peers'
comments and questions than males. Wade's (1994) study of
education majors' attitudes toward discussion indicated that
three fourths of the men surveyed thought that their ideas
8 SAGE Open
"always" or "often" made an important contribution to dis-
cussion, but less than half the women indicated similar confi-
dence in the quality of their contributions.
In addition to race and gender, researchers have identified
other factors that potentially influence students'participation
in discussions, some of which suggest strategies for increas-
ing student participation including praising students (Nunn,
1996); the quality of instructors' questions (Auster &
MacRone, 1994; Foster, 1981; Murray, 1997; Nunn, 1996)
with open-ended or divergent questions being particularly
powerful (Murray, 1997; Nunn, 1996; Reynolds & Nunn,
1998); student ability (Foster, 1981); willingness of instruc-
tors to self-disclose (Goldstein & Benassi, 1994); instructors
who ask for elaboration of student questions/answers, accep-
tance of student answers, using students' names, correcting
wrong answers, and class size (Fischer & Grant, 1983;
McKeachie, 1990; Nunn, 1996); instructors with more
"open" (vs. authoritarian) styles (Townsend & Pace, 2005);
grading students' participation (Auster & MacRone, 1994;
Nunn, 1996); student preparedness (Hyde & Ruth, 2002);
instructors'use of humor (Reynolds & Nunn, 1998); interest-
ing topics and a general climate of respect (Fassinger, 1995;
Wade, 1994); and explicit efforts to improve students' confi-
dence (Rocca, 2010). Instructors' skill at facilitating discus-
sion has been found to affect both student participation and
the overall quality of discussion (Garside, 1996; Nunn,
1996).
Researchers have reported that students are more likely to
participate in small-group rather than whole-class discus-
sions. Kaufmann (2010), in an ethnographic study of discus-
sion in an ethnic studies course, reported that students who
were relatively quiet during whole-group discussions were
among the dominant voices in small-group discussions.
Other researchers reported higher levels of engagement and
participation in small groups among students in a first-year
physics course (Hamann et al., 2012) and an upper-level
political science course (Mayo, Sharma, & Muller, 2009).
Small-group discussions have also been found to encour-
age higher levels of participation among working-class stu-
dents of color (Kaufmann, 2010), Black men (Pollock,
Hamann, & Wilson, 2011), and ethnic and linguistic minori-
ties (Lee, 2001) who feel silenced during whole-class discus-
sions. Lee, for example, found that six Korean-speaking
graduate students who rarely spoke during whole-class dis-
cussions actively participated in small-group discussions.
The main reason the Korean students cited for their silence in
large-group discussions was the belief that their language
was inadequate for these fast-moving discussions. Lee con-
cluded that differences in sociocultural values and educa-
tional practices, individual differences, and the classroom
context also affected these students' participation in
discussions.
Summary and discussion. Rocca (2010) observed that student
engagement is a crucial factor in student learning and that
increased participation in class activities, including discus-
sions, will lead to higher levels of student engagement and
learning. Participation rates in postsecondary classrooms are
generally low, however, with some groups (e.g., males,
White females) even less likely to participate than others
(e.g., female students of color). According to a limited num-
ber of studies, small groups as well as certain instructor
behaviors seem to foster increased student participation, but
it is not clear whether higher levels of participation necessar-
ily result in heightened student engagement. Moreover, none
of the research summarized in this section considered the
quality of student participation or the degree to which par-
ticipation actually facilitates student learning. The definition
of student participation may be "somewhat elusive" as Aus-
ter and MacRone (1994, p. 289) observe, but it is fairly cer-
tain that not all forms of student participation correlate with
higher levels of engagement and, ultimately, learning. The
level of student learning will necessarily be a function of the
activities in which students are engaged. Engaging in discus-
sions that require only low-level thinking, for example, will
not lead to higher-level learning. Moreover, students can be
silent and still be engaged in learning (Schultz, 2009). Ulti-
mately, because of the failure of researchers to provide any
definition of "participation" and its relation to student
engagement and learning, these studies provide little insight
into the potential of discussions to enhance learning in post-
secondary settings. And, like the research literature on dis-
cussion generally, researchers focused on the relationship
between discussion and participation have been relatively
silent on the meaning of discussion, an issue that is discussed
in greater detail in the following section.
The Quality of Discussion in College Classrooms
Thirty years ago, in a study of classroom discourse in 40
classes at four universities, Fischer and Grant (1983)
observed that most of the discourse in these classes, includ-
ing during periods described as "discussion," occurred at the
lowest cognitive levels, focusing on the transmission of
knowledge and facts. Similarly, in a study of discussion in a
third-year medical course, Foster (1981) found that nearly
75% of student talk during discussions was at the lowest cog-
nitive level while only 2% was at the highest cognitive lev-
els. More recently, in separate studies, Wedman, Smith, and
Jared (1994) and Hardman and Mroz (1999) concluded that
much of what is taken for discussion in postsecondary class-
rooms is nothing more than recitation.As Benzing and Christ
(1997) observed, it may be that "instructors believe that lec-
ture punctuated by instructor or student questions is a partici-
patory technique" (p 185).
Dillon (1994) cautions that the mere presence of student
talk, no matter how frequent, does not automatically signal
that a discussion is taking place. According to Dillon, discus-
sion is not just any sort of verbal interaction among partici-
pants but a "unique form of group interaction, where people
Dudley-Marling 9
join together in addressing some question of common con-
cern, something they need to understand, appreciate or
decide" (Dillon, 1994, p. 5). Discussion is different from
conversation and other forms of group talk by its "concern
with the development of knowledge, understanding, or judg-
ment among those taking part" (Brookfield & Preskill, 2005,
p. 17). In his widely cited text on discussion, Dillon argues
that discussion focuses on open-ended questions for which
there is more than one possible answer, a point emphasized
by Haroutunian-Gordon (1991). Furthermore, in discussion,
"the talk concentrates upon one topic which is maintained,
extended or developed" (p. 13). Instructors facilitate these
interactions but do not dominate them nor do they insist upon
"correct" answers that, from Dillon's perspective, are anath-
ema to true discussion. Dillon (1994) offers the following
chart (Figure 1, which has been adapted here) to distinguish
discussion as he defines it from recitation, a form of student
participation that is often (mis)taken for discussion.
Among the studies in this review that examined, directly
or indirectly, the effect of discussion on student learning, it is
difficult to ascertain how many are actually discussions as
defined by Dillon. It may be, however, as Hardman and Mroz
(1999) suggest, that what counts for discussion in many (per-
haps most) of postsecondary classrooms is merely recitation
as in the case of Guetzkow et al. (1954) who described discus-
sion as a place "where students feel free to expose their mis-
conceptions so they can be corrected" (p. 196). Studies
employing discussions restricted to very brief exchanges
(e.g., Harton et al., 2002; Windschitl, 1999) that limit stu-
dents' opportunities to extend or develop topics also fail to
meet Dillon's criteria for discussion. Other studies offered
evidence that at least some elements of discussion were pres-
ent (see Table 1 for a summary of research studies examining
the effectiveness of discussion). In both Brazeau et al. (1999)
and Finkel (1999), for example, discussions began with ques-
tions for which there were more than one possible answer.
Four of the studies reviewed here include transcripts that sug-
gest the rich, engaging discussions advocated by Dillon
(1994). However, with the exception of these studies, few of
the studies included here offered the detail needed to ascertain
what researchers counted as discussion. Of the 31 studies
examining the efficacy of discussion in postsecondary class-
rooms, six studies provided at least some information on the
researchers'sense of the meaning of discussion. Only 7 of the
31 studies offered any actual evidence that discussions
included some of the elements discussed by Dillon. The
nature of discussion in studies of class participation is even
less clear. Only 3 of the 22 studies offered any sense for what
counted as discussion (Garside, 1996; Hamann et al., 2012;
Wade, 1994), and only 1 of these 3 studies provided evidence
that the classroom interactions they described contained ele-
ments of discussions as defined by Dillon (Kaufmann, 2010).
Summary and discussion.Dillon (1994) argues that not all
verbal interactions that occur among students and teachers
are discussions. Dillon does, however, offer a set of criteria
that, for him, distinguish discussions from other forms of
classroom interactions (e.g., recitation). Michaels et al.
(2008) go further and argue that, even when discussions
occur, not all forms of discussion lead to deep, engaged
learning. High-quality academically productive discussions,
they argue, are well planned, carefully orchestrated interac-
tions that necessarily lead to collaborative meaning making.
Because researchers mostly fail to define what they mean by
discussion and there is generally an absence of excerpts of
classroom discourse in studies of the effect of discussion on
student learning, it is, with the exception of a few studies,
difficult to ascertain the quality of discussions--or even
whether discussions occurred at all--in the research studies
summarized here. It is noteworthy that five of the six studies
that provided some guidelines for what counts as discussion
and six of the seven studies that provided evidence that the
interactions they described included at least some elements
of discussion (as indicated by Dillon) reported positive
effects for discussion on student learning (see Table 2). All
four of the studies that examined both the effects of

elements of discussion produced positive effects for
discussion.
Discussion
The studies identified for this review examined the power of
discussion to affect student learning as well as various fac-
tors that influence student participation in class discussions.
Researchers have examined small- and large-group discus-
sions in a range of academic disciplines in public and pri-
vate universities in various locales. But because of the
failure of most researchers to be clear about the meaning of
discussion, no strong claims about the efficacy of discussion
emerge from this literature review. In general, research on
the efficacy of discussion in postsecondary settings is incon-
clusive because researchers are unclear about the definition
of discussion that informs their research and rarely provide
sufficient data to independently evaluate (using Dillon's cri-
teria, for example) whether the verbal interactions in studies
of discussion in postsecondary classrooms actually qualify
as "discussion." Studies that included evidence that interac-
tions among students and instructors contained some of the
elements of discussion as defined by Dillon (1994) were
more likely to produce positive effects for discussions (see
Table 2). However, given the small number of studies that
met this criterion, this observation is suggestive at best.
For now, the strongest support for including discussions
in postsecondary classroom comes from those few studies of
discussion in postsecondary classrooms that are explicit
about the meaning of discussion and, indirectly, from
research in K-12 settings. For example, based on their review
of the literature on discussion in K-12 classrooms, Mercer
and Howe (2012) conclude that "there is now comprehensive
evidence to support [the] view that talk amongst teachers and
students, if of the right quality, can be a powerful motor for
the development of reasoning and the improvement of aca-
demic performance" (p. 13). The degree to which research
on discussion in K-12 settings can be generalized to college
and university settings is uncertain, however. Rocca (2010)
argues that, because of the age of the students and issues of
academic freedom, the nature of discussions in postsecond-
ary classrooms may be qualitatively different from discus-
sions in K-12 classrooms. Still, there is reason to hope that
discussions that are "of the right quality" will positively
affect student learning in both K-12 and postsecondary
settings.
There is also clear theoretical support for class discussion
in postsecondary classrooms. From the perspective of socio-
cultural theories of learning, human knowledge is fundamen-
tally social in nature. Mercer and Howe (2012) observe that
"the relationship between social activity and individual
thinking is vital . . . Knowledge is not just an individual pos-
session but also the creation and shared property of members
of communities" (p. 12). In this context, conceptual change
is a key learning outcome (Morton, 2012), and, for this to
occur, students need to be active participants in their learning
by engaging in goal-directed conversations with others as a
means of "co-construct[ing] their knowledge through col-
laboration with their peers on meaningful activities"
(Morrone, Harkness, D'Ambrosio, & Caulfield, 2004, p. 20).
Discussion provides a potentially productive space for stu-
dents and their teachers to "co-construct their knowledge"
through dialogic interaction (Morton, 2012).
Research in K-12 settings, undergirded by sociocultural
learning theories that emphasize the social construction of
knowledge (Gee, 2011), supports the use of discussion in
postsecondary classrooms. What is missing, however, are
studies of discussion in college and university classrooms
that provide empirical evidence that students are actually
engaging in discussion and use outcome measures--mea-
sures of conceptual change, for example--that are sensitive

to the (social) learning goals of discussion as Dillon (1994),
among others, conceptualizes it. Many of the studies sum-
marized above focus on outcome measures more sensitive to
transmission approaches to instruction like lecture.
Despite the shortcomings of the research literature on dis-
cussion in postsecondary settings, there are several implica-
tions that emerge from this review.
First, the effective use of discussion in postsecondary set-
tings demands that faculty learn how to orchestrate discus-
sions effectively which requires that they have a clear idea of
what productive discussions look like to begin with (Garside,
1996; Hardman & Mroz, 1999; Nunn, 1996). Hardman and
Mroz (1999) found that, with support, postsecondary teach-
ers could learn "recitation-breaking" strategies that lead to
interactions that take on the characteristics of genuine dis-
cussions as described by Dillon (1994). But, even where dis-
cussions occur, not all discussions are equally productive.
Effective discussions involve more than just student talk.
Academically productive discussions begin with clear goals
and carefully planned questions for which there is more than
one possible answer (Haroutunian-Gordon, 1991; Michaels
et al., 2008). Productive discussions also require skillful
management by instructors as students work together to
resolve some question, problem, or issue (Michaels et al.,
2008). This requires deliberate effort to learn to plan for and
orchestrate discussions. Facilitating effective discussions is a
skill that must be learned.
Second, given the evidence that students have had few
opportunities to participate in authentic discussions even
in K-12 settings (Mercer & Howe, 2012), there is no rea-
son to expect that all or even most students will come to
class knowing how to participate in productive discus-
sions. Just as faculty will need to learn how to conduct
discussions, students will need support to learn how to
participate in this specific academic language practice
(Gee, 2011). Therefore, instructors must offer students
explicit guidance on the purposes of discussions and how
to participate effectively in them. There is also reason to
believe that students may need to be persuaded of the ped-
agogical value of discussion given the finding that at least
some students see discussions as ineffective, or worse, as
an abdication of responsibility by faculty to "teach" (e.g.,
Crabtree et al., 2001; Eglash, 1954).
Probably the strongest claim that can be made on the basis
of this review is that researchers examining the efficacy of
discussion in postsecondary classrooms need to be clearer
about the meaning of discussion in their research and whether
what emerges in the classrooms they study really is discus-
sion as opposed to other forms of classroom talk (e.g., recita-
tion). Dillon (1994) provides a useful framework for this
purpose.
Finally, there is no research or theoretical framework indi-
cating that discussion should completely replace other peda-
gogical approaches (including lecture) in postsecondary
settings. The K-12 research indicates that for some pedagog-
ical goals--conceptual change, for example--discussion
may be a powerful teaching tool in the hands of skilled teach-
ers. Lecture, on the other hand, may be superior to discussion
for the immediate recall of factual information (McKeachie,
1990). Instructors need to balance discussion with authorita-
tive talk according to their pedagogical goals (Mercer &
Howe, 2012). An overreliance on discussion may limit stu-
dents'access to the expert knowledge needed for their devel-
opment as scholars. On the other hand, the overuse of lecture
and recitation in postsecondary classrooms restricts students'
opportunities to engage in the critical thinking and problem
solving that characterizes the highest levels of scholarly
achievement. As Brookfield and Preskill observe,
Discussion . . . teaches us dispositions and practices, provides us
with the opportunity to serve and connect with others, and tests
our ability to confront the most difficult of problems and think
them through collaboratively. (p. 20)
Research on discussion that addresses the shortcomings
of the extant body of research on discussion in postsecondary
settings will help to clarify the benefits of discussion for
postsecondary students and help to determine the appropriate
balance between discussion and lecture. In the meantime,
there is sufficient support from sociocultural theory, research
in K-12 settings, and limited research in postsecondary class-
rooms for college and university faculty willing to include
discussion in their teaching.
