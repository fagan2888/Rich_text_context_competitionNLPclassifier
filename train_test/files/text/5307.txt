Abstract
Animals with front facing eyes benefit from a substantial overlap in the visual fields of each eye, and
devote specialized brain processes to using the horizontal spatial disparities produced as a result of
viewing the same object with two laterally placed eyes, to derived depth or 3-D stereo
information. This provides the advantage to break the camouflage of objects in front of similarly
textured background and improves hand eye coordination for grasping objects close at hand. It is
widely thought that about 5% of the population have a lazy eye and lack stereo vision, so it is often
supposed that most of the population (95%) have good stereo abilities. We show that this is not
the case; 68% have good to excellent stereo (the haves) and 32% have moderate to poor stereo
(the have-nots). Why so many people lack good 3-D stereo vision is unclear but it is likely to be
neural and reversible.

Introduction
Much is known about the properties of stereo processing (Howard & Rogers, 2002), what
computations are involved (Barlow, Blakemore, & Pettigrew, 1967) and where in the brain
stereo-processing occurs (Neri, 2004). Even though 3-D movies, 3-D television technology,
and 3-D apps for mobile devices are commonplace, the percentage of the general population
that possesses normal stereopsis is a matter of controversy. Although it is commonly believed
to be about 95% (Birch et al., 2008, Stelmach & Tam, 1996, Zaroff, Knutelska, & Frumkes,
2003), there is evidence (Richards, 1970, 1971) that it could be as low as 80% with 20%
stereoanomalous. Having made laboratory measurements of different aspects of stereo vision
over the last 30 years, the first author has been surprised by how difficult it is to find subjects
with otherwise normal vision who have good stereo sensitivity, unlike other 2-D visual
functions, such as contrast sensitivity, color sensitivity, motion sensitivity, where this is not
the case. Here, in two related studies (one in the general population and the other in a first-
year university student class), we tested the stereo acuity of over 600 people using an online
random dot stereo test in which the task was to discriminate (with unlimited viewing time)
whether a square area defined by horizontal disparity alone was in front or behind the screen
plane; one of the simplest tests of stereo function.
Methods
Stereo Depth Judgment Task
The hybrid 2-AFC task involved, on each presentation, searching for the location (upper
right, lower right, upper left, lower left) of a square box (see Figure 1(b)) that was defined
only by disparity (and surrounded by zero disparity regions) and determining whether it was
in front or behind the zero disparity fixation plane (monitor screen plane). There was no time
limit, and the observer's response which was indicated by a button press controlled when the
next presentation occurred.
Stimulus Generation
Each stimulus was a 1,024 Â 768 pixel rectangle image made up of random noise patterns.
The noise pattern comprised square dots. Each square dot was a three-by-three group of
pixels. We generated a stereo subregion (394 Â 384 pixels; width Â height) using horizontal
disparity. The screen resolution and color depth were obtained by Javascript running on the
clients' web browsers.
The subjects' viewing distance varied from 40 cm to 200 cm as input by each viewer
(see Figure 1(a)). In some cases, we used the height information input by each viewer to
estimate the arm length span.
Test Procedure
There were 11 disparity levels, ranging from 1 to 11 pixels. At the largest disparity of 11
pixels, the simulated depth was very obvious to stereo normal observers. We conducted two
separate experiments.
Canadian broadcasting corporation experiment. The Erst experiment was intended to be a rapid
test suitable for screening a large subject sample with a simple stopping criterion to determine
threshold. The stimuli were presented in increasing order of difficulty, starting from the
2 i-Perception 6(3)
easiest (i.e., largest disparity). To pass each level of difficulty, correct answers on two stimuli
(of the same disparity) were required. At each presentation, a stimulus was drawn randomly
from a set of eight pregenerated images (of the same disparity, where the box was in front or
behind with equal probability at the four possible locations). The possible responses were ``In
Front,'' ``Behind,'' and ``Not Sure.'' A test session terminated upon one of the following
conditions:
. First incorrect answer
. Two consecutive ``Not Sure'' answers
. Correct answer at the most difficult stimulus.

McGill psych100 experiment. A similar experiment was then repeated among the students
attending Psych-100 class at McGill University with a narrow age range (around 20 years
of age). We used a different set of anaglyph, red­green glasses, and hence, the chromaticity of
stimuli was adjusted accordingly. Aside from this change, the order of stimulus presentation
and stopping criterion remained the same.
Data Analysis
To ensure valid entries, we filtered the entries using a number of criteria including the date of
the entry (limited to one month), e-mail address (for the student group, only valid McGill
addresses), IP address (limited to one for each subject), age (10­90 years), and indicated
visual distance (>40 cm). This conservative approach greatly reduced our number of
participants but increased the reliability of the web-based approach we used.
Results
The results displayed in Figure 1(c, upper frame) are broadly distributed extending over a
range of approximately 2.0 log units and can be modeled by two overlapping populations;
one with a peak at 1.983 log arcsec (the haves) and another with a peak located at 2.845 log
arcsec (the have-nots). There is no age dependence (lower frame).
A similar study within a student population (first-year psychology class at McGill
University) produced similar results (Figure 1(d, upper frame)). Thus both groups exhibit
a loss of stereo capabilities that extent to a large proportion of the population.
Discussion
These results are surprising in that they suggest that there is a large percentage (32%) of
people with below normal stereopsis. These stereo acuities vary over a 300:1 range with 24 to
40% of the population being 10 times worse. It is known that 5% of the population has
amblyopia (lazy eye) and would be expected to have either poor or immeasurable stereo
vision. It is hard to explain the current result in terms of subjects' performing poorly due to
lack of task comprehension because the student population exhibited a comparable
dichotomous behavior. Another issue to consider is uncorrected refractive error as this
would reduce stereo performance. However, this seems an unlikely explanation for two
reasons. First, only a unilateral refractive error difference is likely to reduced stereo and to
account for this degree of difference (approximately 1 log unit), it would need to be in excess
of four dioptres, which is rare (incidence 1.9%; Mohammadi et al., 2013). Second, the
students are less likely to have uncorrected refractive errors compared with the general
population and yet they display comparable results. Oculomotor instability may also be a
potential reason for the poor stereo performances as we assume subjects could adequately
converge in the screen which represented zero disparity. Media opacities and age-related
changes may also limit stereopsis if they are unilateral in the older age group, but the
dichotomy reported here is not dependent on age.
We speculate that at the very least there is a large range of stereo capabilities in the normal
population and that its likely cause is neural. It is likely that this is related to the original
work of Richards (1970, 1971) who reported that about 20% of the population are stereo

deficient, lacking either crossed or uncrossed disparity detectors. Our stimuli are very
different from those used by Richards (1970, 1971), being global random dot stereograms,
rather than local vertical lines, but like Richards (1970, 1971) our method also involves a
signed disparity judgment. Studies that don't use a signed disparity judgment, relying instead
on the detection of depth or depth-defined shape, do not report high levels of stereo anomaly
within the normal population (Birch et al., 2008). Nevertheless, it is surprising that stereopsis
shows such individual variability when other visual sensitivities do not. The adult brain
maintains a degree of neural plasticity, and it has recently been demonstrated that
stereoscopic sensitivity in adults can be improved by training (Astle, McGraw, & Webb,
2011), so it remains a possibility that the have-nots can be transformed into haves with the
right training.
