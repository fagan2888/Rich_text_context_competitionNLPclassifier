Aftermarket Performance of Health Care
and Biopharmaceutical IPOs: Evidence
From ASEAN Countries
Kulabutr Komenkul, PhD1,2 and Santi Kiranand, DBA3
Abstract
We examine the evidence from the long-run abnormal returns using data for 76 health care and biopharmaceutical initial
public offerings (IPOs) listed in a 29-year period between 1986 and 2014 in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Laos. Based on
the event-time approach, the 3-year stock returns of the IPOs are investigated using cumulative abnormal return (CAR) and
buy-and-hold abnormal return (BHAR). As a robustness check, the calendar-time approach, related to the market model as
well as Fama-French and Carhart models, was applied for verifying long-run abnormal returns. We found evidence that the
health care IPOs overperform in the long-run, irrespective of the alternative benchmarks and methods. In addition, when we
divide our sample into 5 groups by listing countries, our results show that the health care stock prices of the Singaporean
firms behaved differently from those of most of the other firms in ASEAN. The Singaporean IPOs are characterized by a
worse post-offering performance, whereas the IPOs of Malaysian and Thai health care companies performed better in the
long-run.

Introduction
Globally, health care expenditure (spending per capita)
increased dramatically by 60% between 2004 and 2014.
Health care expenditure covers a wide range of areas, such as
medical practitioner incomes, costly medical procedures,
pharmaceutical products, and hospital administration. World
Health Organization (WHO) data estimate the average total
health care spending per capita in Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) to be US$544. Interestingly, not too
many investors realize that the ASEAN region (ie, Brunei,
Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) provides
good access to a wealth of innovation in the health care ser-
vice sector; much of this innovation has been derived from
other sectors. In addition, there is an increasing demand for
health care services, spurred on by the growth in middle-
class households, better education, and greater health aware-
ness. Singapore and Brunei top the list with expenditure per
capita of US$2273 and US$1449, respectively. Medical tour-
ism steadily contributes to the increasing number of foreign
patients using some of ASEAN's world-class medical facili-
ties. Thailand's health tourism is now worth about US$2 bil-
lion and receives 40% of the medical tourist arrivals in Asia.
Malaysia's foreign patients, meanwhile, reached over
600 000 in 2015 with the revenue from them increasing from
US$83.6 million in 2007 to US$197.6 million in 2015.
ASEAN is expected to boost health spending to provide bet-
ter health care services and catch up with the average spend-
ing rate in fully developed countries.
Rapidly aging populations, especially in Singapore and
Thailand; the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases; and
government initiatives improving access to health care ser-
vices are the key significant factors for overall public health
care spending in the South East Asia region. Recently, the
medical tourism market in Malaysia, Singapore, andThailand
was projected to grow from between US$2.64 billion in 2014
and US$4.48 billion in 2019. Because of this, health care
firms are eager for growth through developing and expand-
ing their products and services, with entry into the public
market typically receiving funding from multiple sources.

2 INQUIRY
Another well-known source of funding for several heath care
companies is through the issue of their own initial public
offerings (IPOs). An IPO is defined as the first offer of stock
by a private company to the public. IPOs are generally issued
by companies seeking or raising capital to create a public
market in which founders and other shareholders can convert
some of their wealth into cash at a future date and the IPO
issuers will obtain the assistance of underwriters or invest-
ment banks.1
There are several reasons for health care, biotechnology,
and pharmaceutical firms seeking to sell their stocks to the
public; they are the internal growth of existing or potential
products and product lines, diversification into related and
unrelated areas, an exit mechanism for owners, and for sur-
vival.2 However, IPO anomalies have been closely examined
over the last few decades. A well-known study was of "IPO
underperformance in the long-run."3 Most prior empirical
studies suggest that IPOs have negative abnormal returns
over different holding periods after going public.4-6 Thus,
investors could not gain any returns if they bought the IPOs
on the first trading day and held them for the long-horizon
period. However, health care IPO performance has not been
examined by itself. To the best of our knowledge, the perfor-
mance of health care IPOs has only received limited atten-
tion in the literature. Existing studies focus only on the US
market.7-9 Firms doing business related to a medical program
or to pharmaceutical and biotechnology must deal with rev-
enue flows that are not driven by market forces; the demand
for health care services is instead determined by government
policies. This may lead health care and biopharmaceutical
IPOs to perform differently in the long-run when compared
with IPOs from other industries. In this article, we aimed to
study the long-term performance of health care and biophar-
maceutical IPOs for companies listed on the Indonesian,
Malaysian, Singaporean, and Thai stock markets and to
examine the robustness of existing empirical evidence, using
a variety of different methods to calculate abnormal returns
by applying different market benchmarks and by using more
robust statistical tests.
In terms of the value of investigating the ASEAN case
and the contribution of our study, the health care IPO stock
market is particularly interesting to analyze for a number of
reasons. First, compared with other countries that already
have established markets, such as the United States and the
United Kingdom, the stock markets in the Southeast Asia
region are relatively new stock exchanges. As a result, there
are not yet many public companies from the health care
industry listed on these stock exchanges. Such health care
IPOs have consequently not been closely studied in the
ASEAN market in the same way as they have been in estab-
lished markets. Second, the size of firms in Southeast Asia is
moderately small, and thus, the exchange requirements to list
IPOs differ from those in developed countries. This may
cause different patterns in ASEAN health care IPOs' pricing
and thus lead to different price dynamics over time. This is
also of significant interest because the existence of any long-
term return patterns in the IPO market can affect investment
strategies. Third, the ASEAN exchange is a moderate trading
market, but it is nevertheless well integrated into the global
financial system. Hence, the results presented in our study
may have broader implications for many emerging markets
that are also trying to go global by implementing economic,
trade, and financial reforms. Our findings may therefore
indeed be useful and provoke expressions of interest in health
care IPOs from investors in many other emerging markets.
Finally, we also present more results for robustness purposes,
using a calendar-time approach based on the market model
and on the Fama and French 3-factor and the Carhart 4-factor
models. The calendar-time approach is applied in this study
to address contemporaneous cross-correlation, which may be
a concern, given some financial turmoil (eg, the Asian
Financial Crisis in 1997, and also the Global Financial Crisis
in 2007) affecting all IPO stocks in the market at certain
points in time during the sample period.
Our findings suggest that health care and biopharmaceuti-
cal IPOs in ASEAN outperform in the long-run, irrespective
of the alternative benchmarks and methods used. Based on
the event-time and the calendar-time approaches, our find-
ings support the results of studies by Palkon10 and Williams
and Young,9 which concluded that health care IPOs overper-
form in the long-horizon. Interestingly, when we consider the
listed countries individually, the Malaysian and Thai IPOs
perform better in the long-run than the Indonesian and
Singaporean IPOs.
Related Literature
The behavior of IPO returns in the long-run has attracted
considerable attention in the literature in recent years. Ritter3
showed evidence of substantial negative returns from IPOs
in the long-horizon. He suggested that IPO firms intend to go
public when investors are overoptimistic about the firm's
future growth potential. Thus, one reason for the long-term
performance of IPOs is a possible overvaluation in the early
aftermarket trading. Ritter11 attributed such long-term under-
performance to the fact that IPO investors are overoptimistic
about IPO valuations, whereas there is much uncertainty
concerning the value and growth of the IPO companies. In
consequence, investors overpay for IPOs in the initial period
of listing. However, when more information becomes avail-
able in the subsequent period, the difference in opinions
between optimistic and pessimistic investors is reduced. As a
result, the IPO price declines after going public, or when the
investors receive more information about the company.
Shiller12 introduces the "fads hypothesis" from an investor's
viewpoint. This maintains that, contrary to the rational expecta-
tion models, there are fads in the stock market, and the IPO
market overpricing is due to the presence of such fads. For a
similar hypothesis, Ritter3,11 proposes an "impresario hypothe-
sis" to explain the phenomenon of IPO underperformance in
Komenkul and Kiranand 3
the long-run. Investment bankers (the impresarios) underprice
IPOs to stimulate an excess in IPO demand. Broadly speaking,
the impresario hypothesis or fads hypothesis demonstrates that
the market for IPOs is subject to fads and that IPOs are deliber-
ately underpriced by investment bankers to create the appear-
ance of excess demand, much in the same way as the promoter
of a rock concert attempts to make it an event. These hypothe-
ses suggest that the lowest subsequent returns should follow
the initial returns.
Most of the prior empirical studies have supported IPO
underperformance in the long-run.3,5,6,13-15 In contrast, the
findings of Jelic et al,16 Ahmad-Zaluki et al,17 and Moshirian
et al18 have all demonstrated IPOs' long-run overperfor-
mance using market index benchmarks in certain countries,
such as Malaysia, China, and Korea. This somewhat mixed
picture regarding IPOs' long-term performance may be
related to the application of different methods and approaches
to measure the abnormal returns. Companies doing business
within the health care service must deal with revenue flows
that are not mainly driven by market forces. Therefore, the
demand for health care services is substantially determined
by government policy, as opposed to consumers' prefer-
ences, as is the case for most other goods and services.8
Therefore, some specific features of health care and biophar-
maceutical shares should be taken into account. The value of
health care and biopharmaceutical IPOs may be adversely
affected if financial markets react to the presence of nonmar-
ket revenue flows. As a result, investors may believe that
firms in the health care sector are less able to enhance reve-
nues through traditional marketing and promotion tech-
niques, compared with their counterparts in other industries.
We would therefore expect IPO underperformance in the
long-run to be as documented by several IPO studies, if the
market treated health care IPOs similarly.
In the health care and biopharmaceutical context, Guirguis
et al8 specifically investigated the postoffering performance
of 223 IPOs issued during 1985-1996 in the health care
industry. Their results showed that the IPOs'3-year buy-and-
hold abnormal return (BHAR) underperformed the returns of
the market index by 15% and the matching health care index
by 85%. Similarly, Brau and Holloway7 examined the after-
market performance of 345 US health care IPOs going public
between 1970 and 2008 in the period up to 5 years after their
listing. They reported that the IPOs underperformed the
benchmark in the long-run by an average of ­0.22%,
­28.32%, and ­51.38% using 1-, 3- and 5-year BHARs,
respectively. In contrast to recent studies, William and
Young9 used 133 biopharmaceutical IPOs listed in the US
market between 1996 and 2007. They found a positive 3-year
aftermarket return of 14.1%. However, they calculated the
long-run return of IPOs by using the offer price. This may
have produced such a biased result because they considered
the initial return (or IPO underpricing) to calculate the long-
run abnormal return. This was similar to the study by Palkon10
of 81 health care IPOs going public in 1997. He also used the
offer price to calculate aftermarket return and thus found
65.4% of the IPOs had a positive return. There are a few
important similarities between the previous event studies of
the long-term performance of health care and biopharmaceu-
tical IPOs.7,8,10 First, they used only BHAR when measuring
the long-run IPO performance and, furthermore, they consid-
ered an equally weighted (EW) portfolio of IPOs.
However, Fama19 suggested that BHAR has more statisti-
cal problems than cumulative abnormal return (CAR) due to
a positive skewness bias. This leads to the negative bias of
the standard t statistics. To address this inference problem,
Lyon et al20 developed new techniques, such as a skewness-
adjusted t test. Unfortunately, previous studies of the health
care performance of IPOs were unaware of the skewness bias
issue. This article addresses these issues in the research anal-
ysis, and in contrast to existing previous studies, the health
care IPO performance in ASEAN countries in the long-run
was examined, using a wide range of alternative benchmarks
and models that had been designed to adjust for size effects.
In addition to this, as a further robustness check, we exam-
ined the cross-section average of the calendar regression
results of the long-run returns.
Research Methodology
Previous studies used several different methods to investi-
gate the long-term performance of IPOs. In general, either
raw returns or abnormal returns (measuring price dynamics
relative to some benchmark) are used to assess the long-run
performance. The studies of Ritter,3 Carter et al,21 Jelic
et al,16 Durukan,22 Ritter and Welch,1 Burrowes and Jones,23
Álvarez and González,24 and Su and Bangassa15 employed
cumulative average returns (CAR) and buy-and-hold returns
(BHAR). In our article, we follow this event-time approach
by exploiting abnormal return measures, CAR and BHAR, to
investigate the performance of health care IPOs in the long-
run. We also selected the appropriate market indices as
benchmarks for each IPO firm depending on their stock
exchange listing and the size of the IPO firms. The abnormal
returns of the IPOs were considered in horizons of up to 36
months after the first day of trading. This was done to be able
to make comparisons with the findings presented in previous
IPO studies, which typically followed Ritter3 and other
papers that had adopted similar methodology.

Data and Sample
The sample adopted in this study includes all 76 health
care and biopharmaceutical IPO stocks in the ASEAN
region, listed on the Indonesian, Malaysian, Singaporean,
Thai, Philippines, Vietnamese, Myanmar, and Lao stock
markets duringtheperiodfrom 1986to2014.Unfortunately,
there is no Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code
system in ASEAN countries. However, they do have their
own particular industry classification, which differs from
exchange to exchange. In our sample, health care services,
hospitals, and pharmaceutical and biotechnological com-
panies are therefore grouped into a single industry, namely,
the health care and biopharmaceutical sector. The stock
price data for individual IPO companies were collected
from the Thomson Reuters DataStream. In particular, the
data comprised each IPO's closing price on the first day of
trading and the 36 monthly stock returns following going
public. The monthly stock returns for each IPO were com-
pared with monthly returns of stock market indices such as
the Jakarta Composite Index (JSX), the FTSE Straits Times
Index (STI), the FTSE Bursa Malaysia, the Stock Exchange
of Thailand (SET), the Philippines Stock Exchange (PSE),
the Hanoi Stock Exchange (HSE), the Yangon Stock
Exchange (YSE), and the Lao Securities Exchange (LSX)
indices.
Table 1 reports the main characteristics of the data divided
according to IPO year across the entire sample and split by
listed country samples. However, for the Philippines,
Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos, the number of health care
IPOs was not large enough for meaningful statistical analy-
sis. We therefore grouped them under one heading, namely,
"Other." Approximately 66% of health care IPOs went pub-
lic after the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 and the Internet
Bubble period. Most of the IPOs in our sample are from the
Malaysian stock market (27%). In all, 24% and 21% of the
sample belong to the Thai and Singaporean stock markets,
respectively.

Empirical Findings
In this section, the main results, including a robustness analysis,
are presented and an extensive discussion of our findings is pro-
vided. Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics for the excess
returns of Thai IPOs over the 36-month period after going pub-
lic. In relatively finite samples, the abnormal return may suffer
from the problem that the excess returns are not normally dis-
tributed. Therefore, the Jarque-Bera test was used to verify the
null hypothesis about normal distribution. We rejected the null
hypothesis. This indicates that the average market-adjusted
returns between months 1 and 36 are not normally distributed,
which may cause statistical inference problems. To check for a
possible bias in the calculation of long-run abnormal returns, we
applied a bootstrapped skewness-adjusted t statistic and the
nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test.
Long-Run Performance Results in the Portfolios of
Health Care and Biopharmaceutical IPOs
Tables 3 and 4 present the EW and VW abnormal returns of
health care IPO firms for up to 3 years after listing. These are
calculated using CAR and BHAR measures. The EW and
VW abnormal returns for the first month are 5.67% and
1.24% and are statistically significant at 0.10 and 0.05 levels.
This implies that the initial return continues to the early
aftermarket trading. For the ASEAN market (entire sample),
the results indicate that health care IPOs are overperforming
between 4.88% (Adj. t-stat = 1.91) at month 1 and 2.82%
(Adj. t-stat = 2.52) and 5.57% (Adj. t-stat = 2.48) for the EW
CARs and BHARs at the end of year 3. This finding of an
underperformance is in contrast with Guirguis et al8 and
Brau and Holloway,7 who showed that the US health care
IPOs underperform relative to the benchmarks in the long-
run. Notably, the aftermarket returns of the ASEAN health
care and biopharmaceutical IPOs, measured by BHAR, dis-
play a much greater overperformance than those using CAR.
However, when we divided the entire sample into 5 subsam-
ples according to listing exchange, we found a wide variation
in the health care IPOs' performance in the long-horizon
across countries. For Malaysian and Thai stock markets, the
results indicate that the health care and biopharmaceutical
IPOs overperformed between 4.08% and 7.94% at month 1

and 57.25% and 18.99% at month 36, respectively, for the
EW BHARs. In contrast, for the Singaporean health care
IPOs, it was found that there were negative returns and that
they were statistically significant at the end of year 3 using
EWCAR (­36.54%) and EWBHAR (­39.41%). Negative
abnormal returns at year 3 were also obtained using the non-
parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test. This finding of under-
performance in the Singapore market is consistent with the
results of existing studies in the US health care market.7,8
Several possible reasons which could explain the underper-
formance of the Singaporean health care IPOs and support
the findings of the US market are that the economic growth
and system differ from those in ASEAN countries and the
size of the capital market is considerably larger than the oth-
ers. Furthermore, Singapore is only one developing country
in the same region.
In attempts to measure the performance of IPOs in the
long-run, one can apply either an EW portfolio of IPOs or a
VW market portfolio to calculate CAR and BHAR. Fama19
suggested that EW returns may produce different inferences
from those derived from VW returns. We therefore consid-
ered both EW and VW portfolios, which provided an impor-
tant robustness check for the findings. The results of a
cross-sectional analysis and a country-specific value-
weighted cumulative abnormal return (VWCAR) and value-
weighted buy-and-hold abnormal return (VWBHAR) over a
36-month horizon are presented in Tables 3 and 4, Panel B.
Using the market VW portfolio of IPOs, the findings show a
similar pattern of results, where the health care and
biopharmaceutical IPOs for the entire Malaysian and Thai
samples have positive abnormal returns after going public
and show poor performance for the Singaporean health care
IPOs.
The CAR and BHAR figures for the health care IPO sam-
ples in Tables 3 and 4 are plotted in Figures 1 to 4. The CAR
and BHAR show an outperformance throughout the whole
long-horizon period for all the Malaysian and Thai IPOs,
whereas the aftermarket returns of the Indonesian health care
IPOs display similar patterns between the event months 1 and
22, after which period the CAR and BHAR drop instanta-
neously. However, the CAR and BHAR, as EW and VW mea-
sures,fortheSingaporeanIPOsmovejustunderthezero-return
line (exhibiting underperformance) until the end of year 3.

Fama19 also suggested that the event-time approach over-
states the statistical inferences, once it no longer controls for
correlation among individual firms. Therefore, as a final
robustness check of the results, the calendar-time portfolio
approach using Fama and French's26 3-factor and Carhart's27
4-factor models was used to eliminate the potential problems
of cross-sectional correlations among ASEAN health care
stocks in the event-time approach and also to obtain more
robust t statistics. First, the average monthly abnormal
returns on a diversified portfolio, composed of firms going
public within the last 36 months in each calendar month

between July 1990 and December 2014, were calculated.
Second, Fama and French's26 and Carhart's27 models were
estimated to test the significance in the pattern of long-term
returns. If IPOs overperform on a risk-adjusted basis, a port-
folio of IPOs should consistently overperform relative to the
Fama-French and the Carhart models. The monthly excess
returns on EW and VW portfolios of IPOs were regressed on
the market premium, the size premium, and the value pre-
mium, using the following model:

(small

between the EW average of the returns on a portfolio of
small stocks and a portfolio of big stocks, and HMLt
(high
minus low) is the monthly return on the zero-investment
portfolio for the book-to-market equity factor in stock
returns, or the difference between the return on a portfolio of
high book-to-market ratio stocks and a portfolio of low book-
to-market ratio stocks, constructed independently from the
size portfolio. The MOMt
variable is therefore defined as:
MOM = 1/2 (Small High + Big High) ­ 1/2 (Small Low +
Big Low). It is the monthly return on a zero-investment port-
folio for a momentum factor constructed as the difference in
returns between a portfolio of past winner stocks and a port-
folio of loser stocks, defined as described above.
The calendar-time approach method weights each month
equally. This leads to a reduction of any underperformance
when it is correlated with the number of IPOs in the portfo-
lios.28 As a result, the intercepts, the estimates of which are
based on the weighted least squares (WLS) method, weighted
by the square root of the number of IPOs in the IPO portfo-
lios in each calendar month, provide a test of the null hypoth-
esis that the mean monthly abnormal return on the
calendar-time portfolio is zero.
Table 5 presents the estimated intercepts from the regres-
sions as indicators of the risk-adjusted performance of the
ASEAN health care IPOs. Considering first the long-run per-
formance of the EW portfolio, the mean intercept for the
Fama-French 3-factor model is 0.48% per month (see Table
5, Panel A). This value implies a 3-year abnormal return of
18.81% [ie, calculated as: (1 + 0.0048)36 ­ 1]. The t statistics
of 3.01 indicates that the average monthly return is statisti-
cally significant at a 1% level. The same table in Panel B
presents the results when the health care IPO portfolios were

value-weighted. In this case, they still overperformed by
0.56% (t-stats = 3.30) per month, indicating a positive 3-year
excess return of 22.27%. The results of similar regressions
for the CAPM and Carhart's model are also reported in the
same table. Notably, the t statistics indicate that the intercept
is positively and strongly significant for the Fama-French
and Carhart's regression models. This article can therefore
conclude that, based on the calendar-time approach, the
ASEAN health care and biopharmaceutical IPO companies
during the 3-year period after going public underperformed
their benchmarks on a risk-adjusted basis using either EW or
VW portfolios. These findings are thus consistent with the
long-run health Care and biopharmaceutical IPOs' perfor-
mance using the event-time approach.
Conclusions
Overall, this article shows that health care and biopharma-
ceutical IPOs in ASEAN overperformed in the long-run after
going public. We find a different long-term health care IPO
price pattern in the ASEAN market data when compared
with the long-term IPO underperformance in other indus-
tries. Moreover, our findings mostly contrast with the exist-
ing US heath care studies. The results show that the fads
hypothesis partially explains the underperformance of
ASEAN health care IPOs in the long-run. For Singaporean
IPOs, the result is similar to the US IPOs in terms of a nega-
tive relation between initial returns and 3-year aftermarket
abnormal returns. However, when the entire sample was seg-
mented into 5 subgroups, we posit that investors who buy
and hold Malaysian and Thai IPOs in the health care and
biopharmaceutical sector can gain positive returns in the
long-run. It can be seen that this study does not support the
impresario hypothesis, if we consider the health care IPOs'
listing in the Thai and Malaysian stock markets. Therefore,
our findings concerning the performance of health care IPOs
over a long-horizon period may depend on the listed country.
For instance, the results from the Singaporean stock market
suggest that investors cannot earn any abnormal returns, irre-
spective of the alternative benchmarks and weighting meth-
ods used. In addition, a possible reason for the Thai and
Malaysian health care IPOs performing better in the long-run
is the longer lock-up (silent) period. The average silent
period for strategic shareholders in Thailand and Malaysia is
about 1 to 1.5 years, whereas it is 3 to 6 months in the United
States and Singapore. The authors expect that investors will
sell their IPOs or reduce their share proportion immediately
after the lock-up period. Interestingly, once we consider EW
and VW returns of health care IPOs separately, we find that
small- and medium-sized firms perform better than big-sized
firms in the long-run.
The findings from this article may also assist investors in
devising active trading strategies, aiming to generate supe-
rior returns by investing in new health care IPOs in ASEAN
(eg, by buying Malaysian and Thai health care IPOs in the
initial aftermarket period and holding them for a long-term
period, instead of short-selling Singaporean health care IPOs
when they are already listed on the market). In addition, the
findings imply that any new issuers may benefit from our
findings about IPO underperformance being due to the lower

Note. The sample period was July 1990 to December 2014, which consists of 294 months. The maximum number of event companies in the IPO
portfolio was 14, which occurred in December 2006. The minimum number of event companies was 6, which occurred in July 1990. This table presents
the regression results of the calendar-time monthly market-adjusted abnormal returns using the market model, the Fama and French (1993) 3-factor
model, and the Carhart 4-factor model. The t statistics are calculated using the time-series standard deviation of the mean monthly abnormal returns.
The statistical significance is generated after making White heteroscedasticity adjustments. The t statistics are shown in brackets. ASEAN = Association
of Southeast Asian Nations; IPO = initial public offering; SMB = small minus big; HML = high minus low; CAPM = capital asset pricing model; MOM =
momentum factor .
***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

sented in our article may have broader policy implications
for many other emerging markets similar to the countries in
ASEAN, which are expanding globally by implementing
economic, trade, and financial reforms. The findings may
therefore also be useful for regulators overseeing other
emerging markets beyond ASEAN countries.
