Introduction
Respiratory diseases are common early in life. They are
associated with school absenteeism and are a main cause of
hospital admission in children (Newacheck and Taylor,
1992; Rullo etal., 2009). For instance, recurrent wheezing
during the first year of life is a major cause of respiratory
morbidity worldwide (Mallol etal., 2010), and childhood
asthma is the main chronic respiratory disease in childhood
(e.g. Bousquet etal., 2010; Silva etal., 2014).
Furthermore, over recent years, the association between
day care centers (DCC) attendance and respiratory diseases
has been reported. Studies have shown that attending a
DCC significantly increases the risk of upper respiratory
infection in preschool children (e.g. Ball et
al., 2002;
Hagerhed-Engman etal., 2006; Lu etal., 2004).
Children's health problems may influence the psycho-
logical functioning of the parental figures and some
studies have demonstrated that there are higher levels of
depression (Bartlett et
al., 2004; Safa et
al., 2012;
Shalowitz etal., 2006) and anxiety symptoms (Safa etal.,
2012; Shalowitz etal., 2006) in mothers when the child
has respiratory disease. Childhood chronic health prob-
lems may also have an impact on the marital relationship

Abstract
This study aimed to examine the differences between mothers of children with and without respiratory problems
in variables related to psychological, parental, and marital functioning and to determine which contributed more to
parenting stress, because there is a lack of information in this field. Participants were 459 mothers of children attending
kindergartens, who accepted to participate. The instruments were The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in
Childhood questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Parenting Stress Index­Short Form, Parenting Stress
Index­Long Form, and Escala de Avaliação da Satisfação em Áreas da Vida Conjugal. Anxiety, depression, and parenting
stress were higher in the more symptomatic children and parenting stress was associated with anxiety, depression, and
marital satisfaction. Findings support the relevance of children's respiratory-related variables to mothers' psychological,
parental, and marital functioning.

(Berge etal., 2006; Kazak etal., 2003; Mullins etal.,
2011). However, this domain has been under explored
when the child has a respiratory disease. Northey etal.
(1998) found that in families with childhood asthma, cou-
ples were less satisfied with their marriages than couples
in the non-asthma group.
Parenting stress can be defined as the aversive psycho-
logical reaction to the demands of being a parent and is
experienced as negative feelings toward the self or toward
the child (Deater-Deckard, 1998: 315). Research has also
shown that mothers of children with respiratory diseases
such as asthma have higher levels of parenting stress com-
pared to mothers of healthy children (e.g. Gupta, 2007;
Hullmann etal., 2010; Thompson and Gustafson, 1996).
Although literature on the relationship between par-
enting stress and depression/anxiety in parents of chil-
dren suffering from respiratory disease was not found,
studies with different samples suggest an association
between parenting stress and maternal psychopathology
(Williford etal., 2007), particularly depression (Ardoino
et
al., 2015; Bailey et
al., 2012; Leigh and Milgrom,
2008; Zajicek-Farber etal., 2012) and anxiety (Leigh
and Milgrom, 2008; Murphy etal., 2010; Rezendes and
Scarpa, 2011).
Positive and supportive marital relationships seem to
have a protective role in battling mental health problems
and promoting parenting efficacy (e.g. Shapiro, 2014).
Although there are studies relating parenting stress to mari-
tal satisfaction (e.g. Benzies etal., 2004; Shapiro, 2014;
Webster-Stratton, 1990), none was found in the context of
respiratory disease.
It was suggested that experiencing stress associated
with life events plays an important role not only in the eti-
ology of several mental and somatic problems (e.g. Glaser
and Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005; Priftis etal., 2009) but also in
the stress experienced in the parenting role (Abidin and
Santos, 2003; Ostberg and Hagekull, 2000; Puff and Renk,
2014). Nevertheless, other authors concluded that major
life events are not predictive of parenting stress (Leigh and
Milgrom, 2008).
In short, within the context of childhood respiratory dis-
ease, there is a general lack of research on the dimensions
under study, and furthermore, the relationship of parenting
stress with the other dimensions and with the disease vari-
ables has either not been addressed or has been insuffi-
ciently explored.
Along these lines, this study aimed (1) to analyze the
differences between mothers of children with and with-
out respiratory health problems in psychological (anxi-
ety/depression), parental (parenting stress and life
events), and marital (satisfaction) functioning, based on
specific disease variables; (2) to determine which factors
contributed to parenting stress considering anxiety,
depression, marital satisfaction, life events, and a global
child health indicator (GCHI).
Method
Participants
This study is part of a broader longitudinal research project,
Environment and Health in Children Day Care Centers
(ENVIRH), which set out to study the association between
indoor air quality in DCC and the health of children attend-
ing them (Araújo-Martins etal., 2014). The ENVIRH pro-
ject comprised two phases: (1) evaluation of the building
characteristics, occupant respiratory health, and ventilation
surrogates (45 DCCs); (2) evaluation of a DCC subgroup
(20 DCCs) selected from Phase I through a cluster analysis
(that considered CO2
concentrations, temperature, and
humidity at indoors, measured in Phase I) by a hierarchical
model (Ward method). DCCs which were further apart in
the dendrogram were chosen. During this phase, and in
relation to Time 1, one DCC dropped out of the study. This
study was integrated within the ENVIRH Phase II, with
two evaluation points: Time 1--Spring/Summer and Time
2--Autumn/Winter. The results presented in this article
refer to Time 1.
The data of this study were collected in 13 of the 20
DCCs participating in Phase II (those DCCs who accepted
the invitation to participate in this part of the study). The
inclusion criterion was mothers with a child aged between
6
months and 5
years old without congenital or chronic
pathology (other than respiratory disease).
The questionnaires were distributed to the mothers by
the DCC staff (education assistants and early childhood
educators) and were then collected by our team members.
The mothers who wished to participate signed an informed
consent. In a universe of 1797 children, 532 adults answered
the questionnaires and from this number 73 were excluded
due to not being mothers.
The sample consisted of 459 mothers aged between 19
and 48
years (M=34.98years; SD=4.92). The target chil-
dren (children of the mothers characterized above) were
aged 8­78months (M=44.74months, SD=19.35) and were
mostly male (52.1%), only or youngest children in the sib-
ling position (61.8%). Table 1 shows the mothers' socio-
demographic characteristics.
The majority of mothers had completed higher educa-
tion (50.5%), were employed (91.7%), and married or liv-
ing in common law partnerships (70.1%).
Measures
Respiratory health assessment.To evaluate the children's
respiratory health conditions, the Portuguese version of
The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Child-
hood questionnaire (ISAAC; Rosado-Pinto et
al., 2011)
was used. This questionnaire collects detailed data on
wheezing and allergic diseases, absenteeism, respiratory
infections, and past medical history, and it also includes
environmental questions.
Pedro et al. 3
Parental assessment.The mothers' psychological (anxiety/
depression), parental (parenting stress and life events), and
marital (satisfaction) dimensions were evaluated by means of
the following instruments: (1) The Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale (HADS; Zigmond and Snaith, 1983; Portu-
guese version of Pais-Ribeiro etal., 2007) is a self-assessment
instrument (in the form of a brief questionnaire). It includes an
Anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and a Depression subscale
(HADS-D), each one containing seven items answered on a
4-point response category (from 0--Most of the time to
3--Never), so the possible scores range from 0 to 21 for anxi-
ety and 0 to 21 for depression. Higher scores indicate higher
levels of anxiety and depression. (2) The Parenting Stress
Index­Short Form (PSI-SF;Abidin, 1995; Portuguese version
of Santos, 2011) is a self-report instrument that measures
stress associated with the parenting role. The PSI-SF consists
of 36 statements, with a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from 1
(Totally disagree) to 5 (Totally agree)). This instrument yields
scores for three subscales (in addition to a Total Stress score):
Parental Distress, Parent­Child Dysfunctional Interaction, and
Difficult Child. Higher scores indicate higher levels of parent-
ing stress; (3) The Life Stress Scale of the Parenting Stress
Index­Long Form (PSI-LF;Abidin, 1995; Portuguese version
ofAbidin and Santos, 2003) aims to assess parents'life events
over the past 12months and answers are obtained in a dichoto-
mous format (yes/no) for the occurrence of each life event; (4)
The Scale for the Evaluation of Satisfaction in Areas of Cou-
ple Life (originally Escala de Avaliação da Satisfação em
Áreas da Vida Conjugal; EASAVIC, Narciso and Costa, 1996)
is a 44-item self-report measure answered on a 6-point Likert
scale (ranging from 1 (Totally unsatisfied) to 6 (Totally satis-
fied)) that evaluates marital satisfaction. It is organized in two
subscales, Marital Functioning (e.g. satisfaction with commu-
nication and conflict, family functions) and Love (e.g. sexual-
ity, emotional intimacy) and allows scores for each subscale
and a Total score (used in this study). Higher scores indicate
higher levels of marital satisfaction. All the questionnaires
used in the parental assessment had adequate psychometric
(validity and reliability) properties.
Socio-demographic information (e.g. age and child gen-
der, mothers' age, marital status, employment status, and
schooling) was also collected.
Procedure
Research protocol was handed out by the DCC staff from
the 13 DCCs that agreed to participate. This protocol
included the presentation of the study, instructions, and
questionnaires (related to children's respiratory health
assessment and parental assessment). Mothers who
accepted to participate signed an informed consent. The
participation was voluntary.
The ENVIRH project and this study followed the ethical
procedures for research with humans and those proposed
by the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association
(Helsinki Declaration) and were approved by the Ethics
Committee of the NOVA Medical School.
Statistical analyses
Student's t-tests were used to compare groups as the distribu-
tions of the variables met the normality assumption. The
bivariate associations between parenting stress and anxiety,
depression, marital satisfaction, and life events were tested
using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Multiple linear regres-
sion analysis was conducted to predict parenting stress, con-
sidering depression, anxiety, marital satisfaction, life stress,
and a GCHI as independent variables. The GCHI was created
to study the child respiratory health variables' influence, cor-
responding to the sum of 10 variables (presence of wheezing
episodes, presence of respiratory infection episodes, otitis,
antibiotic intake, going to the doctor because of wheezing
episodes, going to the doctor for respiratory infection epi-
sodes, emergency room attendance due to wheezing episodes,
emergency room attendance due to respiratory infection epi-
sodes, missed day care days due to wheezing episodes, and
missed day care days due to respiratory infection episodes).
Variables with a p value <0.25 in the univariate analysis
were included in the model. A significance level of =0.05
was considered. All data were analyzed using the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences for Windows version 22.0
(IBM Corp. Released 2013, IBM SPSS Statistics for
Windows, Version 22.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.).

as a function of specific disease variables--number of wheez-
ing episodes, emergency room attendance (number of times)
for respiratory infections, emergency room attendance (num-
ber of times) for wheezing episodes, and number of episodes
treated with antibiotic intake.
Table 2 presents the results about the number of wheez-
ing episodes.
Results show that mothers of children with one or more
wheezing episodes had more depression symptoms
(p=0.025) and more anxiety, although with lower strength
of evidence (p=0.057).
Results related to emergency room attendance (number
of times) for respiratory infections are presented in Table 3.
Mothers of children with one or more emergency room
visits due to respiratory infections were shown to have
more anxiety symptoms (p=0.017).
Concerning emergency room attendance (number of
times) for wheezing episodes (Table 4), the results indi-
cated that mothers of children with one or more emergency
room visits due to wheezing episodes had more depression
symptoms (p=0.025).
Table 5 shows the results regarding the number of epi-
sodes treated with antibiotic intake.
A statistically significant difference between the group
with no episodes treated with antibiotic intake and the
group with one or more episodes treated with antibiotic
intake was observed for anxiety (p<0.001), depression
(p=0.003), parental distress (p=0.032), and total parenting
stress (p=0.047).
Associated factors with parenting stress
To determine the factors that contributed to parenting stress, a
univariate regression analysis was performed for all the dimen-
sions under study (anxiety, depression, marital satisfaction,
life events, and GCHI). Table 6 shows the results obtained.
With the exception of the GCHI, all the variables under
study proved to significantly contribute to parenting stress.
A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted
considering these variables as predictors. The model
assumptions were verified. The Durbin­Watson value was
1.95 (the residuals were independent and random) and the
VIF (variance inflation factor) values were 1.57 for anxi-
ety, 1.67 for depression, and 1.29 for marital satisfaction.
Table 7 presents the results obtained in this final model,
which explained 51percent of the variance (p<0.001).

In short, the main results of this research were mothers
of children with one or more wheezing episodes, with one
or more emergency room visits due to respiratory infec-
tions or wheezing episodes, and with antibiotic intake had
more depression and/or anxiety symptoms; and that anxi-
ety, depression, and marital satisfaction proved to influence
parenting stress.
Discussion
This study aimed to examine the differences between mothers
of children with and without respiratory problems in variables
related to psychological, parental, and marital functioning
and to determine which contributed more to parenting stress.
One of the aims of this study was to analyze the differ-
ences between mothers of children with and without respira-
tory disease in the psychological (anxiety/depression),
parental (parenting stress and life events), and marital (satis-
faction) dimensions as a function of specific disease-related
variables. The results showed that mothers' levels of depres-
sion and anxiety were higher in those whose children had
more wheezing episodes (although the anxiety result was
only marginally significant), and the same trend was observed
in those whose children took antibiotics more frequently.
These findings are consistent with previous research, as sev-
eral authors stated that children's health problems (not res-
piratoryhealthproblems)arerelatedtomothers'psychological
functioning and to higher levels of anxiety and depression
symptoms (Lewin etal., 2005; Stevenson-Hinde etal., 2007;
Thompson and Gustafson, 1996; Yilmaz etal., 2008). This is
also the case for mothers whose children have a respiratory
pathology (Bartlett etal., 2004; Safa etal., 2012; Shalowitz
etal., 2006).
The results also point to more anxious and depressive
symptomatology in mothers whose children needed to go to
the emergency room due to wheezing episodes and higher
levels of anxiety symptoms in mothers whose children needed
to go to the emergency room due to respiratory infections.
The findings for depression are in line with the study by
Bartlett etal. (2001), who found higher levels of depression
in mothers whose children had higher rates of emergency
room attendance due to respiratory problems. As for anxiety,
mothers with higher levels of anxiety possibly have a greater
need to take their children to the emergency room not only
due to the severity of the disease itself, but mainly because
they feel more insecure and frightened by the situation.

Results also showed that mothers of children with one or
more episodes treated with antibiotic intake have higher
scores in the parental distress subscale and in the parenting
stress total score. These results are in line with those of
Carotenuto et
al. (2013), who reported higher parenting
stress in the mothers of children with a chronic disease.
Results showed no variations in marital satisfaction as a
function of the respiratory disease variables, thus differing
from the study by Northey etal. (1998), which suggested
that couples with a child with asthma were less satisfied
with their marriages than non-asthma couples. Further
research is needed concerning the association between mar-
ital satisfaction and respiratory disease.
Another goal of this study was to determine whether spe-
cific psychological, parental, marital, and disease variables
were associated with parenting stress.The final model showed
that only anxiety, depression, and marital satisfaction contrib-
uted to parenting stress. Higher levels of anxiety and depres-
sion and lower levels of marital satisfaction were associated
with higher levels of parenting stress. These results are con-
sistent with the results of other studies in relation to depres-
sion and anxiety (Leigh and Milgrom, 2008; Lewin etal.,
2005; Murphy et
al., 2010; Rezendes and Scarpa, 2011;
Stevenson-Hinde etal., 2007; Williford etal., 2007), which
also pointed to an influence of these dimensions on parenting
stress. However, neither of these studies was related to res-
piratory diseases. There are a few studies linking parenting
stress to marital satisfaction. Nevertheless, the findings of this
study follow the same direction as those obtained by other
authors (Benzies etal., 2004; Crnic and Low, 2002; Shapiro,
2014), who reported an inverse relationship between parent-
ing stress and marital satisfaction, but once again, the target
samples were not related to respiratory disease.
In this study, life events were not found to be related to
parenting stress. This result contradicts the perspective of
different authors (e.g. Abidin, 1995; Ostberg and Hagekull,
2000) but is in line with the study by Leigh and Milgrom
(2008), which emphasized that major life events are not
predictive of parenting stress.
The results showed that respiratory disease (GCHI) did
not contribute to parenting stress. One possible explanation
could be seasonal variations concerning respiratory disease.
In fact, the data collection was performed in the Spring/
Summer period, which is a season during which the incidence
of respiratory infections is low (Boloursaz etal., 2013).
Conclusion
The results indicated that among the dimensions under
study, only anxiety, depression, and parenting stress varied
on the basis of child wheezing outcomes and antibiotic
intake. This variation was more extensive for psychological
dimensions (anxiety/depression). With regard to the associ-
ated factors of parenting stress, anxiety, depression, and
marital satisfaction contributed to parenting stress. The
absence of an association between parenting stress and res-
piratory health variables deserves further research.
Among the limitations of this study, the fact that data
collection took place in a period with a low incidence of
respiratory infections should be noted. Nevertheless, this
study is part of a broader research project that intends to
compare results from two different seasons (longitudinal
study). Data corresponding to the Autumn/Winter season
will be analyzed at a later stage in the near future.
Additionally, although all mothers were invited to par-
ticipate, there is still a risk for selection bias, as it is not
possible to know whether mothers who agreed to partici-
pate and those who did not accepted had the same charac-
teristics (e.g. the latter could be more or less stressed).
Mothers may benefit from being enrolled in early pre-
ventive intervention programs that will help them adjust to
motherhood, in reducing stress and anxiety and this will
contribute to promote child health and well-being.
We hope that future research will provide useful answers
to remaining questions about parenting stress and the pro-
cesses that link it to children's health and well-being. Such
research will hopefully give health care professionals a
clearer understanding of the importance of the psychosocial
and health factors involved when taking care of children
with respiratory disease.
