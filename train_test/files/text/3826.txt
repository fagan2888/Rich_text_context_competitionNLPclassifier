Abstract
Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is well known to play a major role in the cell
growth, survival, proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis of various cancer cells. Most of the citrus species offer large
quantities of phytochemicals that have beneficial effects attributed to their chemical components. Our study was carried out
to evaluate the anticancer effects of the pericarp of Iyokan (Citrus iyo Hort. ex Tanaka), locally known as yeagam in Korea,
through modulation of the STAT3 signaling pathway in both tumor cells and a nude mice model. The effect of supercritical
extracts of yeagam peel (SEYG) on STAT3 activation, associated protein kinases, STAT3-regulated gene products, cellular
proliferation, and apoptosis was examined. The in vivo effect of SEYG on the growth of DU145 human prostate xenograft
tumors in athymic nu/nu male mice was also investigated. We found SEYG exerted substantial inhibitory effect on STAT3
activation in human prostate cancer DU145 cells as compared to other tumor cells analyzed. SEYG inhibited proliferation
and downregulated the expression of various STAT3-regulated gene products such as bcl-2, bcl-xL, survivin, IAP-1/2,
cyclin D1, cyclin E, COX-2, VEGF, and MMP-9. This correlated with an increase in apoptosis as indicated by an increase
in the expression of p53 and p21 proteins, the sub-G1 arrest, and caspase-3-induced PARP cleavage. When administered
intraperitoneally, SEYG reduced the growth of DU145 human prostate xenograft tumors through downmodulation of
STAT3 activation in athymic nu/nu male mice. Overall, these results suggest that SEYG extract has the potential source of
STAT3 inhibitors that may have a potential in chemoprevention of human prostate cancer cells.

Introduction
One potential source of signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3) blockers is natural dietary compo-
nents. A number of animal studies and epidemiological
studies in human propose that fruits and vegetables can pre-
vent cancer.1 Citrus is a common term and genus (Citrus) of
flowering plants in the rue family, Rutaceae. Citrus is
believed to have originated from the part of Southeast Asia
bordered by Northeast India, Burma (Myanmar), and the
Yunnan province of China.2 Natural and cultivated origin
hybrids include commercially important fruits such as the
oranges, grapefruit, lemons, some limes, and some tanger-
ines. We describe here the bioactive potential of the fruit of
Citrus iyo Hort. ex Tanaka (locally known as Iyokan),
which is one of a variety of citrus fruits. The citrus fruits
have been shown to suppress the growth of various tumors,
including prostate carcinoma,3,4 breast carcinoma,5 colon
carcinoma,6,7 liver carcinoma,8,9 and lung carcinoma.10
Most of the citrus species offer large quantities of phyto-
chemicals that have beneficial effects attributed to their
chemical components: tangeretin, nobiletin, hesperetin,
naringin, and naringenin. We have recently shown that nob-
iletin, one of citrus flavonoids, can downregulate CXC che-
mokine receptor type 4 and matrix metallopeptidase-9
through the suppression of the constitutive NF-B and
MAPKs activation.11 We further observed that nobiletin can
induce apoptosis and potentiate the effects of the anticancer
drug 5-fluorouracil in p53-mutated SNU-16 human gastric
cancer cells.12 Moreover, tangeretin,13 naringin,14 narin-
genin,15 and hesperetin,16 derived from citrus fruits, are
known to exhibit diverse anticancer activities in a variety of
tumor cells.
The signal transducer and activator of transcription
(STAT) proteins consist of a 7-member family of latent
cytoplasmic transcription factors that are stimulated through
tyrosine phosphorylation by various cytokines (eg, interleu-
kin-6, tumor necrosis factor-), growth factors (eg, epider-
mal growth factor, transforming growth factor-, hepatocyte
growth factor), and oncogenic kinases (eg, Src).17 STAT
activation pathways have been strongly associated with the
proliferation, antiapoptosis, and chemoresistance of
tumors.18 We have previously reported that the anticancer
effects of Dangyuja (Citrus grandis Osbeck) leaves are
mediated in part through suppression of STAT3 activation.19
It is possible that supercritical extracts of yeagam peel
(SEYG) may also mediate its effects through the modula-
tion of this pathway. Moreover, the detailed molecular
mechanisms(s) by which SEYG mediates antitumor activi-
ties has not yet been fully elucidated.
Once activated, STAT3 undergoes phosphorylation-
induced homodimerization, leading to nuclear transloca-
tion, DNA binding, and subsequent gene transcription. The
phosphorylation is mediated through the activation of non-
receptor protein tyrosine kinases called janus-like kinase
(JAK). JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 have been impli-
cated in the activation of STAT3.20 In addition, the role of
c-Src kinase has been demonstrated in STAT3 phosphoryla-
tion.21 STAT3 has been shown to regulate the expression of
genes that participate in oncogenesis, such as apoptosis
inhibitors (bcl-xl, bcl-2, IAP-1/2, and survivin), cell-cycle
regulators (COX-2, cyclin D
1
, and cyclin E), and inducers
of angiogenesis (MMP-9 and VEGF).18 Thus, small mole-
cule inhibitors of STAT3 activation have the potential for
both the prevention and treatment of cancer.22,23
Because of the critical role of STAT3 in survival, prolif-
eration, metastasis, and angiogenesis, we postulated that
SEYG mediates its effects through the suppression of the
STAT3 pathway. The results that follow indicate that SEYG
specifically suppressed constitutive STAT3 activation and
downregulated the expression of cell survival, proliferative,
and angiogenic gene products, leading to the suppression of
proliferation and the induction of apoptosis in human pros-
tate cancer DU145 cells. SEYG also inhibited the growth of
human DU145 cells and suppressed constitutive STAT3
signaling pathway in a xenograft mouse prostate model.
Materials and Methods
Plant Materials
Fruits of Citrus iyo Hort. ex Tanaka, locally known as yea-
gam, were collected from the National Institute of
Subtropical Agriculture, Jeju Province, Korea. The fruits
were harvested from native plants during the harvest season
(from December 2011 to January 2012). Botanical samples
were previously taxonomically identified, and voucher
specimens were deposited in the laboratory of Dr S. K. Cho
at the College of Applied Life Sciences, Jeju National
University.
Supercritical Fluid Extraction
Peel of yeagam (331 g) were loaded separately into a 1-L
thick-walled stainless steel thimble extraction cell and
extracted at 50°C for 2 hours. The extraction was performed
using CO
2
at 300 bar pressure in a diaphragm compressor
(Haskel Co, Bellingham, WA). The extracts were deposited
in a separator attached to a metering valve and held in a
circulating bath at 0°C. Finally, the extracts were collected
into a clean vial and stored at -21°C until analysis.
Reagents
An 100 mg/mL solution of SEYG was prepared in 30% etha-
nol (diluted in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]]), stored in
Kim et al 229
small aliquots at -20°C, diluted in the culture medium for in
vitro experiments or diluted in the PBS for in vivo experi-
ments just before use. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-
diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), propidium iodide (PI),
Tris base, glycine, NaCl, sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), and
bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich (St Louis, MO). RPMI 1640, Dulbecco's modified
Eagle medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), and
LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSAkit were obtained from
ThermoFisherScientificInc(Waltham,MA).5-Biotinylated
STAT3 and Oct-1 oligonucleotide were from Bioneer
Corporation (Daejeon, Korea).Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-
rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody, 0.4% trypan blue vital stain, and
antibiotic-antimycotic mixture were obtained from Life
Technologies (Grand Island, NY). Anti-COX-2 antibody
was obtained from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Anti-
phospho-JAK1, anti-JAK1, anti-phospho-JAK2, anti-JAK2,
anti-phospho-Src, and anti-Src antibodies were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-
phospho-STAT3, anti-STAT3, anti-cyclin D1, anti-cyclin E,
anti-p21, anti-p53, anti-bcl-2, anti-bcl-xL, anti-survivin,
anti-IAP-1, anti-IAP-2, anti-VEGF, anti-MMP-9 (matrix
metalloproteinase-9), anti-caspase-3, anti-cleaved cas-
pase-3, anti-PARP, anti-Ki-67, anti-CD31, anti--actin, and
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)­conjugated secondary anti-
bodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa
Cruz, CA). Caspase-3 inhibitor was from Calbiochem (San
Diego, CA). TUNEL (terminal transferase mediated dUTP-
fluorescein nick end labeling) assay kit was from Roche
Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). Whole-cell
lysates of tumor tissues were obtained with T-PER Tissue
Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL).
Cell Lines
Human multiple myeloma U266, human myeloid leukemia
K562, human prostate carcinoma DU145, PC-3, normal
human prostate RWPE-1, human breast carcinoma
MDA-MB-231, and human hepatocellular liver carcinoma
HepG2 and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). M2182 was kindly provided by Dr Paul B.
Fisher (Virginia Commonwealth University School of
Medicine, Richmond, VA). U266, K562, DU145, PC-3,
M2182, RWPE-1, and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS. HepG2 and
MEF cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing
10% FBS. All media were also supplemented with 100 U/
mL of penicillin and 100 µg/mL of streptomycin.
MTT Assay
Cell viability was analyzed by an MTT assay to detect
NADH-dependent dehydrogenase activity,24 as described
previously.25
Western Blotting
After the cells were treated with the indicated concentra-
tions of SEYG, the cells were lysed and the total protein
concentrations were determined by Bradford reagent
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Lysates were resolved on
sodium dodecyl­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE).26 Western blot analysis was performed
using a method described previously.25 Statistical analy-
sis and densitometry values for Western blot experiments
were estimated by the Sigmaplot (Systat Software, Inc,
San Jose, CA) and Image J software (National Institutes
of Health, Bethesda, MD).
EMSA for STAT3-DNA Binding
STAT3-DNA binding was analyzed by electrophoretic mobil-
ity shift assay (EMSA) using a 5-biotinylated STAT3 oligo-
nucleotide (5-GATCCTTCTGGGAATTCCTAGATC-3 and
5-GATCTAGGAATTCCCAGAAGGATC-3). Oct-1 EMSA
served as a loading control. The Oct-1 probe contained the
sequence 5-TTCTAGTGATTTGCATTCGACA-3 and
5-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3. Electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed as described pre-
viously.25 The membrane was detected following manufac-
turer instructions using LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA
kit (Waltham, MA).
Immunocytochemistry for STAT3 Localization
Immunocytochemistry was performed as described
previously.27
Monitoring of Cell Growth With the RTCA MP
Instrument
Cell growth behavior was continuously monitored for 48
hours using the xCELLigence RTCAMPInstrument (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Background
impedance was measured in 100 µL cell culture medium per
well. The final volume was adjusted to 200 µL cell culture
medium, including 5 × 103 cells/well. After plating, imped-
ance was recorded in 15-minute intervals. All experiments
were performed in triplicates. Cell Index (CI) values were
normalized to the time point of 200 µg/mL of SEYG admin-
istration (referred to as normalized CI).
Transfection of Plasmids
We investigated the ability of commercially available elec-
troporation systems, the Neon Transfection System
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfection efficiency was
measured by Western blot analysis. MEF cells were pre-
pared for transfection after cells were resuspended with 120
µL of Neon Resuspension Buffer R for every 1 million cells.
230 Integrative Cancer Therapies 16(2)
For electroporation, MEF cells with 1 µg of pMXs-STAT3C
or pMXs-gw plasmids were aliquoted into a sterile micro-
centrifuge tube. A Neon Tip was inserted into the Neon
Pipette and the mixture was aspirated into the tip avoiding
air bubbles. The Neon Pipette was then inserted into the
Neon Tube containing 3 mL of Neon Electrolytic Buffer E in
the Neon Pipette Station. MEF cells were pulsed once with a
voltage of 1350 and a width of 30. After 48 hours of trans-
fection, MEF cells were treated with 200 µg/mL of SEYG
for 6 hours or 24 hours. Then whole-cell extracts were pre-
pared for phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705), STAT3, PARP, cyclin
D1, and -actin analysis by Western blotting.
Cell Cycle Analysis
Cell cycle analysis was performed as described
previously.28
Annexin V Assay
One of the early indicators of apoptosis is the rapid translo-
cation and accumulation of the membrane phospholipid
phosphatidylserine from the cell's cytoplasmic interface to
the extracellular surface. This loss of membrane asymmetry
can be detected using the binding properties of annexin V.
To detect apoptosis, we used annexin V antibody conju-
gated with the fluorescent dye fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC). Annexin V assay was performed using a method
described previously.28
Studies With Caspase-3 Inhibitor
DU145 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in
a 60-mm plate. The cells were pretreated with 20 µM of
caspase-3 inhibitor for 2 hours and then treated with SEYG
for an additional 24 hours, and then subjected to annexin V
and PI staining. The cells were washed and observed
accordingly with flow cytometry (Becton-Dickinson,
Heidelberg, Germany). Acquisition and analysis of the data
were performed using Cell Quest 3.0 software.
TUNEL Assay
TUNEL assay was performed as described previously.29
Animals
Allproceduresinvolvinganimalswerereviewedandapproved
by KHU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(KHUASP(SE)-13-025). Six-week-old athymic nu/nu male
mice (NARABiotech, Seoul, Korea) were implanted subcuta-
neously in the right flank with DU145 cells. The animals were
housed (11 mice/cage) in the standard mice plexiglass cages
in a room maintained at constant temperature and humidity
under 12-hour light and dark cycle and fed with regular auto-
claved mouse chow with water ad libitum. None of the mice
exhibited any lesions and all were tested pathogen-free.
Before initiating the experiment, we acclimatized all mice to a
pulverized diet for 3 days.
Subcutaneous Implantation of DU145 Cells
DU145 cells were harvested from subconfluent cultures,
washed once in serum-free medium, and resuspended in PBS.
Only suspensions consisting of single cells, with >90% viabil-
ity, were used for the injections. DU145 cells (4 × 106/100 µL
PBS-Matrigel [1:1]) were injected subcutaneously into the
right flank of the mice. To prevent leakage, a cotton swab was
held cautiously for 1 minute over the site of injection.
Experimental Protocol
When tumors have reached 0.25 cm in diameter, the mice
were randomized into the following treatment groups
(n = 11 per group). Group I was given PBS (200 µL, intra-
peritoneally [ip] thrice/week), group II was given SEYG
(50 mg/kg body weight, ip thrice/week), and group III was
given SEYG (200 mg/kg body weight, ip thrice/week).
Therapy was continued for 4 weeks, and the animals were
euthanized 1 week later. Primary tumors were excised and
the final tumor volume was measured as V = 4/3r3, where
r is the mean radius of the 3 dimensions (length, width, and
depth). Half of the tumor tissue was fixed in formalin and
embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemistry and rou-
tine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The other half
was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.
Western Blot Analysis for Tumor Tissues
Prostate tumor tissues (75-100 mg) from control and exper-
imental mice were minced and incubated on ice for 30 min-
utes in 0.5 mL of ice-cold T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction
Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The minced tissue was cen-
trifuged at 16000 × g at 4°C for 20 minutes. The proteins
were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to
nitrocellulose membranes, blotted with each antibody, and
detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (GE
Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). Densitometry values for
Western blot experiments were estimated by the Image J
software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).
Immunohistochemical Analysis of Prostate
Tumor Samples
Solid tumors from control and various treatment groups were
fixed with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin, processed, and
embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut and deparaffinized in
Kim et al 231
xylene, and dehydrated in graded alcohol and finally hydrated
in water. Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling the slide
in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0) for 30 minutes.
Immunohistochemistry was performed following manufac-
turer instructions (ImmPRESS Reagent Kit; Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Briefly, endogenous peroxi-
daseswerequenchedwith3%hydrogenperoxide.Nonspecific
binding was blocked by incubation in the blocking reagent in
the ImmPRESS Reagent Kit according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Sections were incubated overnight with primary
antibodies as follows: anti-Ki-67, anti-CD31, anti-cleaved
caspase-3 (each at 1:100 dilutions). Slides were subsequently
washed several times in PBS and were incubated with
ImmPRESS reagent according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions. Immunoreactive species were detected using 3,3-
diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) as a substrate.
Sections were counterstained with Gill's hematoxylin and
mounted under glass cover slips. Images were taken using an
Olympus BX51 microscope (magnification, 20×). Positive
cells (brown) were quantitated using the Image-Pro plus 6.0
software package (Media Cybernetics, Inc, Rockville, MD).
Gas Chromatography­Mass Spectrometry (GC-
MS) Analysis
Chromatographic analysis was carried out using a Shimadzu
GC-MS (model QP-2010, Shimadzu Co, Kyoto, Japan)
attached to AOC-5000 autosampler in electron impact mode.
The ionization voltage was 70 eV, and the temperatures of the
injector and interface were 250°C and 290°C, respectively.
The capillary column used was an Rtx-5MS (30 m length,
0.25 mm internal diameter, and 0.25 µm film thickness). The
oven temperature was programmed at 60°C (isothermal for 2
minutes) and was ramped to 250°C at 5°C/min and to 310°C
at 8°C/min (isothermal for 12 minutes). Helium was used as
the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min with 57.4 kPa pres-
sure, and an injector volume of 1 µL using a 1:10 split ratio.
Mass range was from m/z 40 to 500 amu. The extracts of the
fruits were solubilized in n-hexane, filtered through a 0.20-
µm syringe filter (Advantec, Tokyo, Japan), and aliquots
were injected into the GC-MS. Mass spectra of each com-
pound were tentatively identified with the mass spectral data
contained within the WILEY7 and NIST05 libraries and by
their Kovats indices relative to C
7
-C
30
n-alkanes (Sigma-
Aldrich, St Louis, MO) on an Rtx-5MS column. Further ten-
tative identification was completed by comparing the mass
spectra with those of authentic standards.30
For the determination of concentration of major com-
pounds, limonene, linalool, and geranyl acetate in extract,
calibration curves of reference standards at 3 concentrations
were prepared in chloroform: 0.5, 1, and 2 µg/mL for limo-
nene, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 µg/mL for linalool, and 0.05, 0.1, and
0.2 µg/mL for geranyl acetate, respectively, in the same
condition.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test and
one-way analysis of variance, (ANOVA). A P value of less
than .05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
SEYG Exerts Cytotoxicity Against Various Types
of Human Cancer Cells
To determine cytotoxicity, cultured human multiple
myeloma (U266), human myeloid leukemia (K562), human
prostate carcinoma (DU145), human breast carcinoma
(MDA-MB-231), human hepatocellular liver carcinoma
(HepG2), and normal human prostate (RWPE-1) cells were
treated with indicated concentrations of SEYG for 24 hours,
and viability was measured by MTT assay. As shown in
Figure 1A, SEYG broadly inhibited the viability of 5 tumor
cells in a dose-dependent manner. The results indicate that
inhibition of cell viability by SEYG is cell type nonspecific.
However, SEYG had no substantial effect on the suppres-
sion of cell viability in RWPE-1 cells.
SEYG Inhibits Constitutive STAT3
Phosphorylation in Human Prostate Cancer
DU145 Cells
Previous studies have shown that STAT3 is a key point of
convergence of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways. We
next investigated whether SEYG can modulate constitutive
STAT3 activation in 5 tumor cells. Because U266, K562,
DU145, MDA-MB-231, and HepG2 cells have been shown
to express constitutive STAT3 activation,25,31,32 we set out to
determine whether SEYG could inhibit STAT3 phosphory-
lation in these cells. As shown in Figure 1B, the constitutive
activation of STAT3 was clearly suppressed by SEYG in
DU145 cells. However, SEYG had a minimal effect on
U266, MDA-MB-231, and HepG2 cells. In addition, SEYG
had no effect on the suppression of constitutive STAT3
phosphorylation in K562 cells. Furthermore, as shown in
Figure 1C, we determined whether SEYG could suppress
STAT3 phosphorylation in various prostate cancer cell
lines. We found that SEYG suppressed the constitutive
phosphorylation of STAT3 in DU145, PC-3, and M2182
prostate cancer cells.
SEYG Suppresses Constitutive STAT3
Phosphorylation in a Time- and Dose-Dependent
Manner
Human prostate cancer (DU145) cells are well known to
express constitutively active STAT3.25 Whether SEYG can
modulate the constitutive STAT3 activation in the cells was

and RWPE-1 cells (1 × 104 cells/well) were incubated at 37°C with various indicated concentrations of SEYG for 24 hours, and the
viable cells were assayed using the MTT reagent. ***P < .001 compared to nontreated. (B and C) Cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were

3 independent experiments. Graphs represent band intensities of indicated proteins. All data were expressed as mean ± SD. ***P

STAT3. The results shown here are representative of 3 independent experiments. Graphs represent band intensities of indicated
proteins. All data were expressed as mean ± SD. **P < .01 versus control.
Kim et al 233
investigated. We determined the incubation time with
SEYG required for the suppression of STAT3 activation in
DU145 cells. As shown in Figure 1D (upper panel), the
inhibition was time-dependent, with strong inhibition
occurring at around 6 hours, with no effect on the expres-
sion of STAT3 (Figure 1D, lower panel). As shown in
Figure 1E (upper panel), SEYG suppressed the constitutive
activation of STAT3 in a concentration-dependent manner,
with substantial inhibition occurring at 200 µg/mL. SEYG
had no effect on the expression of STAT3 protein (Figure
1E, lower panel).
SEYG Suppresses Constitutive Activation of
JAK1/JAK2
STAT3 has been reported to be activated by the soluble
tyrosine kinases of the Janus family (JAK).20 Because
JAK1/JAK2 are the main kinases involved, we examined
the effect of SEYG on JAK1/JAK2 activation. As shown in
Figure 2A-D, both JAK1 and JAK2 were constitutively
active in DU145 cells and the treatment with SEYG clearly
suppressed this phosphorylation in a time- and concentra-
tion-dependent manner.
SEYG Inhibits Constitutive Activation of Src
Because STAT3 is also activated by soluble tyrosine kinases
of the Src kinase families,21 we determined the effect of
SEYG on the constitutive activation of Src kinase in DU145
cells. We found that SEYG suppressed the constitutive
phosphorylation of Src kinase (Figure 2E and F, upper
panel). The levels of total Src kinase remained unchanged
under the same conditions (Figure 2E and F, lower panel).
Overall, our data clearly indicate that SEYG may block the
cooperation of JAK1/2 and Src involved in tyrosyl phos-
phorylation of STAT3.
SEYG Inhibits Binding of STAT3 to the DNA
Because tyrosine phosphorylation causes the dimerization of
STATs and their translocation to the nucleus, where they bind
to DNA and regulate gene transcription,33 we determined
whether SEYG suppresses the DNA binding activities of
STAT3. EMSA analysis of nuclear extracts prepared from
DU145 cells showed that SEYG reduced STAT3-DNA bind-
ing activities in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A). These
results show that SEYG abrogates the DNAbinding ability of
STAT3.
SEYG Reduces Nuclear Pool of STAT3 in Tumor
Cells
Because the active dimer of STAT3 is capable of translocat-
ing to the nucleus and inducing transcription of specific
target genes,33 we determined whether SEYG suppresses
the nuclear translocation of STAT3. Immunocytochemistry
results (Figure 3B) clearly demonstrate that SEYG reduced
the translocation of STAT3 into the nucleus in DU145 cells.
SEYG Suppresses Cell Proliferation in Human
Prostate Cancer Cells
To specifically examine the antitumor activity of SEYG on
DU145 cells, the cells were treated with 200 µg/mL concen-
trations of SEYG, and then cell viability was analyzed using
every 15-minute time intervals with the xCELLigence
RTCA MP Instrument (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). As
shown in Figure 3C, SEYG significantly suppressed cell
proliferation in prostate cancer cells in a time-dependent
manner.
SEYG Downregulates Expression of Various
Proteins Involved in Antiapoptosis, Proliferation,
and Angiogenesis
Because bcl-2, bcl-xL, survivin, IAP-1, and IAP-2 have
been implicated in apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion, we next examined the effects of SEYG on the constitu-
tive expression of these proteins. We found that SEYG
suppressed the expression of antiapoptotic gene products in
a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3D). Also, SEYG
repressed proteins linked with cell proliferation (cyclin D1,
cyclin E, and COX-2) and angiogenesis (MMP-9 and
VEGF; Figure 3E and F).
SEYG Induces the Expression of Both p53 and
p21
p53 is important in multicellular organisms, where it regu-
lates the cell cycle and, thus, functions as a tumor suppres-
sor that is involved in preventing development of cancer.34
The expression of p21 is controlled by the tumor suppressor
protein p53.35 The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is
a prototypical member of the Cip/Kip family of cyclin-
dependent kinase inhibitors. It negatively modulates cell
cycle progression by inhibiting the activities of cyclin E/
CDK2 and cyclin D/CDK4 complexes and blocks DNA
replication by binding to proliferating cell nuclear anti-
gen.36 We found that SEYG induced the expression of both
p53 and p21 in a concentration-dependent manner in pros-
tate tumor cells (Figure 4A).
SEYG Activates Caspase-3 and Causes PARP

Cells were treated with indicated concentration of SEYG for
24 hours and then examined for caspase activation byWestern

activation of caspase-3 by SEYG (Figure 4B, first panel).
Activation of downstream caspases led to the cleavage of a
116 kDa PARP protein into 87 kDa fragments (Figure 4B,
Second panel). Taken together, these results suggest that
SEYG induces caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in DU145
cells.
Overexpression of STAT3 Attenuates SEYG-
Mediated Apoptosis
We investigated whether overexpression of STAT3 by
pMXs-STAT3C plasmid can prevent the effects of SEYG.
The cells transfected with pMXs-STAT3C clearly showed

overexpression of phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) as compared
with those transfected with only control plasmid, and the
overexpression of STAT3 was clearly inhibited by SEYG
treatment in MEF cells (Figure 4C).As shown in Figure 4D,
overexpression of STAT3 led to the attenuation of SEYG-
mediated suppression of cyclin D1 and cleavage of PARP as
compared to the control, indicating that STAT3 is one of the
major molecular targets involved in SEYG-induced
apoptosis.
SEYG Causes the Accumulation of the Cells in
the Sub-G1 Phase of the Cell Cycle
We set out to determine the effect of SEYG on cell cycle
phase distribution. After treatment for 24 hours, SEYG
induced an increased accumulation of 15% of the cell popu-
lation in the sub-G1 phase, which is indicative of apoptosis
(Figure 4E).
SEYG Induces Substantial Apoptosis
We also examined the apoptosis-inducing effects of SEYG
by using the annexin V assay, which detects phosphatidyl-
serine externalization (Figure 4F). When we further exam-
ined for late apoptosis by analyzing DNA strand breaks
using the TUNEL assay, apoptotic cells were also signifi-
cantly increased on SEYG treatment as observed by flow
cytometric analysis (Figure 4H).
Specific Blockade of Caspase-3 Activation
Abrogates SEYG-Induced Apoptosis
To determine whether a specific caspase-3 inhibitor blocks
SEYG-induced apoptosis in DU145 cells, annexin V assay
was performed. We found that the SEYG-induced apoptosis
was suppressed by the caspase-3 inhibitor, indicating the
significance of caspase-3 activation for SEYG-induced
apoptosis in DU145 cells (Figure 4G).
SEYG Induces Antitumor Effects in a Xenograft
Prostate Tumor Model in Nude Mice
We examined the therapeutic potential of SEYG on the
growth of subcutaneously implanted human prostate cancer
cells in nude mice. The experimental protocol is depicted in
Figure 5A. DU145 cells were implanted subcutaneously in
the right flank of nude mice. When tumors had reached 0.25
cm in diameter after a week, the mice were randomized into
3 groups and we started the treatment as per the experimental
protocol. The tumor diameters were measured at 5-day inter-
vals. The treatment was continued for 4 weeks and animals
were sacrificed after 5 weeks. The tumors were excised and
the tumor diameters were measured. We found that the tumor
volume increased rapidly in the control group compared with
the other treatment groups (Figure 5B). We found that SEYG
when given at 200 mg/kg body weight considerably inhibited
the growth of the tumor at day 25 after treatment (P < .01
when compared to control; Figure 5C and D). Furthermore,
the lowest mean tumor weight was found with SEYG when
given at 200 mg/kg body weight (Figure 5E).
SEYG Inhibits Ki-67 and CD31 Expression and
Increases Levels of Cleaved Form of Caspase-3
Expression
While Ki-67-positive index is used as a marker for cell pro-
liferation, the CD31 index is a marker for microvessel den-
sity. Whether SEYG modulate these markers was examined.
Figure 6A shows that SEYG significantly downregulated
the expression of Ki-67 in prostate cancer DU145 tissue
(***P < .001 vs vehicle). Similarly, when examined for
CD31, we found that SEYG significantly reduced the CD31
expression as compared to control group (Figure 6B; **
P < .01 vs vehicle). Cleaved form of caspase-3 was signifi-
cantly increased in the SEYG-treated group as compared
with the control group (Figure 6C; ***P < .001 vs
vehicle).
SEYG Inhibits Phosphorylation of STAT3, JAK1,
JAK2, and Src in Prostate Tumor Tissues
We also evaluated the effect of SEYG on phosphorylation
level of STAT3, JAK1, JAK2, and Src in prostate tumor tis-
sues. Figure 6D shows that SEYG was substantially effec-
tive in suppressing the expression of p-STAT3, p-JAK1,
p-JAK2, and p-Src at 200 mg/kg. SEYG had no effect on
the expression of STAT3, JAK1, JAK2, and Src proteins in
tumor tissues.
SEYG Downregulates Expression of Various
Proteins Involved in Antiapoptosis, Proliferation,
and Angiogenesis in Prostate Tumor Tissues
We next examined whether SEYG can modulate the consti-
tutive expression of antiapoptotic proteins in tumor tissues,
as examined by Western blot analysis. We found that SEYG
suppressed the expression of bcl-2, bcl-xL, survivin, IAP-1,
and IAP-2 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6E). Also,
SEYG repressed proteins linked with cell proliferation
(COX-2, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and MMP-9) and angiogene-
sis (COX-2, MMP-9, and VEGF; Figure 6F).
SEYG Induces the Expression of Both p53 and
p21 in Tumor Tissues
To determine whether SEYG induces expression of p53 and
p21, we examined the expression of these proteins in

Compositional Analysis of SEYG by GC-MS
The extract of yeagam peel was prepared by supercritical
extraction method and analyzed by GC/MS. The com-
pounds were identified and listed in Tables 1 and 2. Sixty-
four compounds belonging to chemical classes of carboxylic
acid (3), alcohol (12), aldehyde (8), ester (10), hydrocarbon
(23), ketone (1), and miscellaneous (8) were tentatively
identified from the SEYG. Hydrocarbon was the chemical
class with the highest proportion, 34.77%. The major hydro-
carbon compound was limonene (21.87%). Similarly, esters
containing 13.38% were characterized as second major
chemical group. Esters of fatty acids were domenent, espe-
cially (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecanoic acid ethyl ester (8.78%) was
detected as a major esterified compound. Monoterpenoidal
alcohols, linalool (8.32%) and -terpineol (2.03%), were
major among the alcohol compounds. On the basis of the
aforementioned results, it is concluded that limonene was
the prime component in SEYG, and major compounds
ranged in content order as follows: linalool, geranyl acetate,
-terpineol, -farnesene, p-cymene, and so on. Next, we
quantitatively analyzed the 3 major active compounds in
the same extract. The content of limonene, linalool, and
geranyl acetate in the extract was 1.21, 0.39, and 0.21 µg/
mL, respectively.
Discussion
The purpose of the present study was evaluation of the anti-
cancer activity of SEYG through the blockage of the STAT3
signaling pathway in both in vitro and in vivo. We found
that this extract suppressed constitutive STAT3 activation at
Tyr705 in human DU145 cells, in parallel with the inhibi-
tion of JAK1, JAK2, and c-Src activation. SEYG downreg-
ulated the expression of STAT3-regulated gene products,
such as bcl-2, bcl-xL, survivin, IAP-1, IAP-2, cyclin D1,
COX-2, VEGF, and MMP-9. It also caused the inhibition of
proliferation and induced substantial apoptosis in DU145
cells. We further investigated the potential therapeutic effi-
cacy of SEYG in an in vivo model of human prostate carci-
noma in mice. Intraperitoneal injection of SEYG in a
xenograft mouse model of DU145 cells resulted in a signifi-
cant suppression of tumor progression, inhibition of STAT3
signaling pathway, and downregulation of various STAT3-
regulated gene products in SEYG-treated tumor tissues.
Our data clearly indicate that SEYG mediates its suppres-
sive effects on the STAT3 activation cascade in human pros-
tate tumor cells.
This is the first report to evaluate the potential effects
of SEYG on STAT3 activation in prostate cancer cells
and a xenograft mouse model. Whether examined by
STAT3 phosphorylation at tyrosine 705, by nuclear trans-
location, or by DNA binding, we found that SEYG sup-
pressed STAT3 activation. How SEYG inhibits activation
of STAT3 was also investigated in detail. The activation
of JAK has been closely linked with STAT3 activation,20
and we observed that SEYG inhibited the activation of
constitutively active JAK1 and JAK2 in DU145 cells.
This is in agreement with a report that AZD1480, a spe-
cific JAK2 blocker, can suppress the growth of human
solid tumors through suppression of STAT3-dependent
tumorigenesis.37
We further found that SEYG suppressed the expression
of several STAT3-regulated genes, including antiapoptotic
gene products (bcl-2, bcl-xL, survivin, IAP-1, and IAP-2),
proliferative (cyclin D1and cyclin E), angiogenic (COX-2
and VEGF), and metastatic (MMP-9) gene products. The
downregulation of cyclin D1and cyclin E expression corre-
lated with suppression in proliferation as observed in
DU145 cells. Bcl-2 and bcl-xL can also block cell death
induced by a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs, and thus
contribute to chemoresistance.38 In addition, activation of
STAT3 signaling can induce survivin gene expression and
confers resistance to apoptosis in breast cancer cells.39
Thus, the downregulation of the expression of bcl-2, bcl-
xL, and survivin is likely to be linked with SEYG's ability
to induce apoptosis in DU145 cells. The downmodulation
of VEGF, COX-2, and MMP-9 expression by SEYG also
emphasized the antiangiogenic and antimetastatic potential
of SEYG in the cells, an aspect that will be investigated in
detail in the future.
We also observed that SEYG significantly suppressed
human prostate carcinoma growth in a xenograft mouse
model as well as downregulated the expression of Ki67 and
CD31 and increased the levels of cleaved form of caspase-3
in the treated group as compared with control. Besides,
SEYG suppressed STAT3 signaling pathway and a variety
of STAT3-regulated gene products from tissues in a xeno-
graft prostate tumor model. Treatment with SEYG (50 mg/
kg body weight) did not appear to substantially inhibit the
phosphorylation of STAT3, JAK1, JAK2, and Src. However,
the volume of tumors in this group is decreased compared
with control group. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge,
no prior studies with SEYG have been reported in a xeno-
graft prostate tumor model in nude mice, and our observa-
tions clearly indicate that SEYG has a clear potential for the
treatment of human prostate carcinoma through the sup-
pression of the STAT3 signaling cascade.
Our in vitro and in vivo experimental findings clearly
indicate that the anticancer effects of SEYG in human pros-
tate carcinoma are mediated through the suppression of the
STAT3 signaling pathway and provide a strong rationale for
pursuing the use of SEYG to enhance treatment efficacy in
prostate cancer patients.
