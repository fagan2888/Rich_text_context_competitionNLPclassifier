These findings contrast with caregiving studies where
amount of support affected marital satisfaction and suggest
that inequalities in involvement with parents may be a criti-

Research on family patterns of intergenerational ex-
changes has focused on questions such as which siblings
in a family are most likely to be involved in exchanges
with aging mothers [1] or which grown children are most
likely to receive support from their parents [2]. Many
middle-aged children who assist a parent are themselves
married, but little attention has been given to how much
help the couple as a unit give or the implication of differ-
ences in the help that each person gives to his/her own
parents for marital satisfaction. At the same time, older
parents may continue to provide support and assistance
to their middle-aged children. Although family lore is
rife with examples of how the help that parents give their
grown children can produce jealousy and conflict in a

Abstract
We examined the context of intergenerational support ex-
changes with aging parents and its association with middle-
aged couples' marital satisfaction. A sample of 197 middle-
aged couples reported support they gave to and received
from their parents (n = 440). Results indicated that couples
providedmoretotalsupporttoandreceivedmorefromtheir
parents as a function of number of living parents, but the
amount of support each parent received (`parent-adjusted
support') was lower when there were more living parents.
The amount of support given to and received from parents
had no association with the couple's marital satisfaction, but
discrepancies in support given to and received from parents
did have a significant association with marital satisfaction.
Husbands who gave more support to their living parent(s)
than their wives reported lower marital satisfaction. A similar
effect on marital satisfaction was found for wives who gave

Support with Aging Parents

married couple, there has been little empirical evidence
of whether the amount of support provided or differenc-
es in help given to and received from each set of parents
is related to marital satisfaction.
In this study, we examined the patterns of support to
parents and their implications for middle-aged couples'
marital satisfaction. We considered first whether the total
amount of support that couples exchange with all parents
and the help that each parent receives (parent-adjusted
help) varied by the number of living parents. We then in-
vestigated whether the total amount of intergenerational
support exchanged or the difference between a husband
and wife in the amount of help given to and received from
parents was associated with marital satisfaction of hus-
bands and wives.
Support Exchanges between Middle-Aged Couples
and Aging Parents
Most empirical research on intergenerational support
has relied on the reports of a single person, usually a mid-
dle-aged daughter, who discusses the help she gives to her
parents or parents-in-law, and who may also give infor-
mation about how much help other family members pro-
vide [3, 4]. Given that much of the support middle-aged
people give to their parents occurs in the context of mar-
ried life, a different picture may emerge when considering
the help that each marital partner gives to and receives
from his or her parents.
The number of living parents involved in exchanges
with a given couple may influence the amount of time
and resources involved in these exchanges [5]. Although
this point has not previously been addressed when con-
sidering the help that adult children provide their aging
parents, there is literature that demonstrates a relation
between the support parents give to young children and
family size. In what is termed `resource depletion,' chil-
dren in larger families receive less support from parents
than children in smaller families [6, 7]. In one of the few
studies of resource depletion focusing on adulthood,
grown children in larger families received fewer resourc-
es from parents than grown children from smaller fami-
lies [8]. These results suggest that family resources are
finite. An alternative perspective, resource expansion,
suggests that middle-aged adults are able to expand avail-
able time and energy to meet increasing needs, whether
due to family size and/or specific life problems. This per-
spective has also received some support in the literature
[2, 9].
Given these conflicting theoretical stances, we consid-
ered two ways that the number of living parents may af-
fect the amount of help a couple gives. First, we consid-
ered whether having more living parents might increase
the amount of demand on the couple as a whole. Specifi-
cally, we posited that when there are more living parents,
the total support that a couple gives would be greater (hy-
pothesis 1). Second, since resources are finite, we expect-
ed that each parent would receive less support when a
couple has a greater total number of living parents. Thus,
the parent-adjusted support (total support divided by
number of living parents) that parents receive from chil-
dren would be lower when the couple has more living
parents (hypothesis 2).
Prior studies have also focused primarily on exchang-
es of support that are transmitted in one direction (from
adult children to frail aging parents). According to the
social exchange theory [10], however, aged parents tend
to reciprocate the exchanges of support they have with
their grown children. Indeed, studies have shown that
that middle-aged offspring not only provided support to
their aging parents, but also received various types of
support from their parents [11­13]. As a result, just as a
couple may give more total support when they have a larg-
er number of living parents, they may receive more total
support when they have more living parents. Thus, we
expected that the total amount of support aging parents
provide to middle-aged couples will increase as a func-
tion of number of living parents (hypothesis 3).
Support Exchanges with Parents and Their
Association with the Middle-Aged Couples' Marital
Satisfaction
According to the family systems theory, conflicts be-
tween husbands and wives often erupt as a result of a
third party in the family [14]. Both in popular culture and
in research, parents-in-law are frequently identified as
the source of marital disputes among middle-aged cou-
ples [15]. The support that one member of a couple gives
or receives from parents may be perceived as interference
or overinvolvement, thus leading to increased tensions in
the marriage.
Much of the literature has been guided by a stress-bur-
den model whereby increased support to parents would
affect marital interactions and satisfaction. Although the
stress-burden model has been helpful in highlighting
crucial aspects of support exchanges on marital satisfac-
tion, its focus has been criticized as too narrow [16, 17].

Some researchers believe that intergenerational support
given to and received from aging parents can be viewed
as a midlife developmental task that offers opportunity
for psychological growth and which helps them develop
a more mutual relationship with parents [18, 19]. This
perspective suggests that providing and receiving sup-
port are normative developmental tasks for married
adults which do not necessarily have a negative impact on
their marriage.
Empirical findings on the impact of providing support
to aging parents on marital satisfaction are mixed. Some
studies have shown that caring for dependent parents has
no significant effect on the marital satisfaction of adult
caregiver daughters [20]. Other studies have found a sig-
nificant association between higher caregiving burden
for aging parents and greater stress that adult offspring
felt in their marriage [21, 22]. As these examples indicate,
most studies that have looked at this issue have focused
on caregiving situations, where one parent needed inten-
sive help for disabilities. It is unclear whether normative
types of support would have a similar negative associa-
tion with middle-aged couples' marriages. However, giv-
en the multiple roles and responsibilities of middle-aged
couples, the amount of support given to and received
from aging parents could contribute to marital distress.
Prior work on this issue has been limited by relying only
on one informant from the couple, usually a wife [23],
without considering whether and how much assistance or
support the other spouse gave to parents, or how the com-
bination of support to each set of parents might be associ-
ated with marital satisfaction.
In the present study, we interviewed both the husband
and wife about the support given to and received from
parents and their marital satisfaction. Consistent with
prior findings that more exchanges with parents lead
to marital dissatisfaction, we hypothesized that couples
providing more help overall to parents would report low-
er marital satisfaction (hypothesis 4). As previous work
has not addressed the implications of receiving support
from parents and marital satisfaction, we examined that
issue without a specific hypothesis (research question 1).
In addition to the effect of the total amount of support
that a couple gives to parents, we also considered if dis-
parities between husband and wife in the amount of help
given and received to parents could lead to lower marital
satisfaction. Some studies found that husbands and wives
often compare each other's involvement in family work
as a reference point [24]. Other studies found that per-
ceived unfairness in family work has an association with
marital dissatisfaction [25, 26]. In the same vein, dispari-
ties in each spouse's involvement with his or her own ag-
ing parents may also create resentment, jealousy or com-
petition. We hypothesized that disparities in support ex-
changed with aging parents will be associated with lower
marital satisfaction (hypothesis 5a). Given that disparity
will have different implications for husbands and wives,
we also examined whether the effect of disparity differs
for husbands and wives (hypothesis 5b).
Methods
Participants
The sample consists of married couples aged 40­60, who were
drawn from the larger sample of the Family Exchange Study. Par-
ticipants were recruited from the Philadelphia Primary Metro-
politan Statistical Area, encompassing five counties in southeast-
ern Pennsylvania and four counties in New Jersey [27], including
urban, suburban and rural areas. Participants were identified in
a two-step process. First, a target participant was identified who
was between the ages of 40 and 60 and had at least one living par-
ent and at least one living child 18 years of age or older. Potential
participants were contacted by telephone using a sampling meth-
od stratified by age (aged 40­50 and 51­60) using a list purchased
from Genesys Corporation and random digit dialing within re-
gional area codes. An interviewer administered the screening in-
strument to determine if the household had an eligible target re-
spondent. When an eligible person was identified, the interview-
er invited him or her to participate in the study.
Target participants completed a telephone interview lasting
approximately 1 h that addressed the support they exchanged and
their relationships with their offspring and aging parents. Of the
845 eligible targets, 633 (75%) agreed to be interviewed. During
this interview, target participants were asked if the research team
could contact children who were 18 years of age or older, their liv-
ing parents, and a spouse if the target was married and the couple
were the shared biological parents of the grown children.
Among 633 target participants, 335 (51%) were married at the
time of the interview, and 287 (86%) of them agreed to let us con-
tact their spouse. Among those 287 spouses, 197 (71%) agreed to
be interviewed. Table 1 presents demographic characteristics, in-
cluding age, ethnicity, work status, education, number of chil-
dren, self-rated health, parents' functioning (activities of daily liv-
ing) and living numbers of parents for the 197 dyads. As seen in
table 1, 17.5% of the wives' parents and 16.5% of the husbands'
parents required assistance with instrumental activities of daily
living, indicating that most parents of these couples were rela-
tively independent.
Measures
Dependent Variables: Marital Satisfaction
Participants rated the overall quality of the relationship with
their spouse on a 5-point scale from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). This
single item was adapted from an item used in the Americans'
Changing Lives survey [28]. The item was reverse coded so that
higher scores represented greater marital satisfaction. The mean
was 4.17 (SD = 0.90) for wives and 4.25 (SD = 0.91) for husbands,
indicating high marital satisfaction.

Support with Aging Parents

Independent Variables: Support Exchanges
Participants rated how often they provided six types of sup-
port to each of their own living parents: emotional, practical as-
sistance, socializing, advice, financial support and talking about
daily events. The first five items were derived from the Social Sup-
port Resources Index [29]. The final item was added based on
preliminary studies of intergenerational support [2]. Frequency of
support for each item was scored on an 8-point scale that ranged
from 1 (less than once a year or not at all) to 8 (daily). As in prior
studies [2, 30], we summed the six items to create a score for how
much support participants gave to each living parent.
We then derived three other support scores. First, we summed
the amount of support the couple gave to and received from all
living parents. Given that the total amount of support couples
provided and received from aging parents was relevant to our hy-
pothesis as well as dyadic analysis, we considered the total amount
of support instead of the support a husband and a wife provided
or received from parents separately. This indicator represents, in
effect, the total output and input of support to and from all par-
ents. Second, to test the resource depletion hypothesis, we divided
the total support the couple reported by the number of living par-
ents to obtain a score of parent-adjusted support (i.e. how much
support each parent received on average). Third, to examine the
relation between the difference in amount of support given by a
husband and wife to their respective parents and marital satisfac-
tion, we created a disparity score by subtracting the total amount
of support that a husband gave to his parents from the total
amount of support that his wife gave to her parents. A positive
disparity score indicates a wife gives more support to her parents
compared to her husband, while a negative score indicates her
husband gives more help to his parents than she does to hers.
In addition, we asked if participants received support from
parents in the same six areas. As with support given, we comput-
ed the total amount of support the couple received from parents,
the parent-adjusted support (how much support received on aver-
age from each living parent) and the disparity of support received
within the couple.
Data Reduction
Prior to conducting analyses, exploratory factor analysis was
used to establish subscales of social support. Separate factor anal-
yses were conducted for husbands', wives', aging mothers' and fa-
thers' social support. Items included the six types of support (i.e.
emotional, practical, advice, financial support, talking about dai-
ly lives and socializing). The results indicated that the factors
loaded on a single scale. This scale demonstrated satisfactory reli-
ability, with alphas ranging from 0.83 to 0.89.
Control Variables
To control for the possibility that giving and receiving support
are due to demographic characteristics or mental and physical
robustness of aging parents and/or their adult children, we mea-
sured a variety of demographic, health and individual difference
variables (e.g. proximity to parents, number of adult children, ed-
ucation). Age was controlled in each analysis to take into account
the possibility that older individuals give less and receive more.
Geographic distance between the parties may influence the
amount of support and, then, marital relationship of middle-aged
couples [1]. Thus, distance to each parent was included as a covari-
ate. The measure of distance to parents was skewed, so we per-
formed a log-linear transformation. Education and income were
considered as covariates since individuals with higher education
and income tend to exchange more support with aging parents
[31]. Poor health status could lower the amount of support given
and increase the amount received [16]. Thus, self-rated health was
included as a covariate. Middle-aged adults provide greater total
amounts of assistance to children when they have a larger number
of children [2]. As a proxy for the amount of support middle-aged
couples provide for children, the present analysis used number of
children as a covariate.
Analysis Plan
Covariates
As a first step, we estimated bivariate associations between
potential covariates and amount of support provided and received
from aging parents. Significant associations were found for par-
ticipant age and health; therefore, these variables were included
in the analyses. Other potential covariates, including number of
children, income, education and distance to parents' home were
not significantly associated with the total amount of support or
parent-adjusted support. Since covariates that are not associated
with the dependent variable may generate spurious associations
between variables [32], these nonsignificant variables were not
included in subsequent analyses.
One-Way ANCOVA
Our first analyses considered support at the level of the couple.
One-way ANCOVAs (GLM) were used to examine if the total
amount of support and the parent-adjusted support the couple
provided and received from parents varied as a function of the
number of living parents (hypotheses 1, 2 and 3).
Multilevel Modeling
We next used multilevel models to examine the effects of total
support given and disparities within couples in the amount of
support they each exchanged with parents on individuals' marital
satisfaction nested within couples (hypotheses 4, 5a, 5b and re-
search question 1). Separate models were computed for the sup-

port that couples gave to their parents and for the support they
received from their parents. In order to account for the lack of in-
dependence in the data, we computed multilevel models using the
PROC MIXED procedure in SAS [33]. We estimated models that
included a repeated effect that allowed errors within couples to be
correlated. The models assumed that observations from a single
respondent would have a covariance structure of compound sym-
metry (all correlations between scores are assumed to be the
same). In these analyses, the couple is an upper level unit and each
spouse is a lower level unit. Marital satisfaction served as a depen-
dent variable. Each model included a fixed effect of the couple's
sum (husband + wife) of support they collectively exchanged with
aging parents, and disparities in support exchange. We did this
because we had an interest in testing whether the total output of
the couple might place strain on the marriage and/or if discrepan-
cies in support had an effect on marital satisfaction. This ap-
proach of including both a total and discrepancy score is gener-
ally recommended in dyadic analyses [34].
Covariates included in the multilevel models were, as noted,
participants' age, education, health and number of children. Low-
er level variables included education and health of each respon-
dent. Upper level control variables included income. Interaction
terms were included to examine whether the effects of disparities
differed for husbands and wives. Prior to computing the interac-
tion terms, we grand mean-centered continuous variables (total
amount of support and disparity in support) and coded the di-
chotomous variable gender as 0 and 1.
Results
The results are presented in three sections. First, we
present two ANCOVA models examining whether the to-
tal and parent-adjusted amount of support vary by the
number of living parents. Next, we provide the multilev-
el models examining whether the total amount of support
and disparities in support exchanged by husbands and
wives with their respective parents were related to marital
satisfaction.
Total Amount of Support and Parent-Adjusted
Support Provided to Parents by Couples
The total amount of all support for parents and the
parent-adjusted support given to each living parent (i.e.
total amount of all support/number of living parents), ad-
justed for the covariates, are presented in table 2. Couples
with more living parents provided more support overall
[F (3, 187) = 101.11, p ! 0.001, partial 2 = 0.62]. Pairwise
comparisons revealed significant differences between
couples with 1, 2, 3 and 4 living parents. None of the co-
variates had a significant effect on the total amount of
support provided to parents.
The number of living parents also had a significant
main effect on the parent-adjusted support couples gave,
after controlling for the covariates [F (3, 187) = 3.61, p !
0.05, partial = 0.07]. Couples with more living parents
gave less support to each parent, compared to couples
with fewer living parents. Pairwise comparisons indicat-
ed significant differences in parent-adjusted support be-
tween couples with 1 and 3 living parents, and between
couples with 2 and 3 living parents. None of the covari-
ates had significant effects on the total amount of support
provided to parents.
Total Amount of Support and Parent-Adjusted
Support Received from Parents
We next analyzed whether the total and parent-adjust-
ed support from aging parents to couples would change
as a function of number of parents. Results are shown in
table 2. As expected, the total amount of support from
parents to their middle-aged children increased with the
number of living parents [F (3, 189) = 94.89, p ! 0.0001,
partial = 0.66]. Pairwise comparison revealed significant
differences between couples with 1 and 2 living parents
and between those with 3 and 4 living parents. The num-

of support each parent gave was not affected by the total
number of living parents.
The Effects of Support Exchanges on Marital
Satisfaction of Couples
The multilevel model using total amount of support
given to parents and disparities between husbands and
wives in support given to parents is shown in table 3. The
total amount of support for parents was not associated
with marital satisfaction for husbands or wives (hypoth-
esis 4). Disparities in support for parents, however, had a
significant effect on marital satisfaction (hypothesis 5a),
and the interaction of gender and disparities was also sig-
nificant (hypothesis 5b).
Figure 1 presents how disparities in support provided
to parents differs by gender. Disparity in support to par-
ents is plotted along the x-axis and husbands' and wives'
marital satisfaction along the y-axis. As indicated above,
a positive disparity score indicates a wife's higher involve-
ment with her parents compared to her husband, and a
negative disparity score indicates a husband's higher in-
volvement with his parents compared to his wife. As il-
lustrated in figure 1, when the disparity is larger in a pos-
itive direction (wives' involvement 1 husbands'), the
marital satisfaction of the husbands is higher and the
wives' marital satisfaction is lower. Conversely, when the

disparity score is larger in a negative direction (husbands'
involvement 1 wives'), the marital satisfaction of the
wives is higher and the husbands' marital satisfaction is
lower.
We also considered the possibility that the effects of
disparities displayed in figure 1 simply reflect the total
amount of support a husband or wife gives. A larger dis-
crepancymightindicatethatonepersongivesalotofsup-
port. To test this possibility, we ran separate regressions
for husbands and wives to examine if the total support
each person gave or received was associated with marital
satisfaction. However, we found that the amount of sup-
port given separately by husbands and wives, or the sup-
port they received, was not associated with their marital
satisfaction.
Also, as shown in model 2 of table 3, the total amount
of support received from parents was not associated with
marital satisfaction for both husbands and wives (re-
search question 1). Disparities in support from parents,
however, had a significant effect on marital satisfaction
(hypothesis 5a). A gender ! disparities interaction was
also significant for support received (hypothesis 5b). The
gender interaction indicates that whoever received more
support from parents compared to one's spouse reported
lower marital satisfaction. Among the covariates, self-rat-
ed health was significantly associated with marital satis-
faction for both husbands and wives in both models.
Discussion
We examined the amounts of support middle-aged
adults exchanged with parents and the effects that the to-
tal amount of support and disparities of support have on
marital satisfaction. In contrast to most prior work, we
included reports from couples, rather than just relying on
one respondent in a marriage or reports drawn from
wives and husbands not married to one another. We also
looked at support given to and received from parents.
Number of Parents as a Determining Factor for
Intergenerational Support Exchange
We looked first at whether the number of living par-
ents was related to the total support given and received,
and the parent-adjusted support each individual parent
received. The results supported both the resource expan-
sion [2] and the resource depletion hypothesis [7]. Con-
sistent with the resource expansion hypothesis, with
more living parents, couples as a whole gave more total
support to their aging parents. However, consistent with
the resource depletion hypothesis, when a couple had
more living parents, each parent received less support.
This situation may not be problematic for the dyad under
ordinary circumstances, such as observed in the current
study, but middle-aged couples with more living parents
may be able to commit less time and fewer resources if the
needs of one parent were to increase due to health prob-
lems or other adverse circumstances. Although not ex-
amined in this study, increases in needs of children may
also lead to reduced resources for other family members.
The results underscored the value of considering the
whole family when examining support exchanges, as well
as the potential that couples may encounter competing
demands when they have more living parents.
Our findings also demonstrated that there are fre-
quent exchanges of various types of support between gen-
erations. The mean pattern indicated that each of the six
types of support was exchanged once a month, with most
participants reporting more frequent exchanges in at
least some domains. These results expand on the finding
by Fingerman et al. [2] from the same data set that shows
a similar pattern of exchanges between the middle gen-
eration and their grown children. In contrast to the con-
tingency theory that posits the need for care or other spe-
cial assistance drives intergenerational exchanges [35],
our findings in a predominantly healthy sample of mid-
dle-aged adults and their parents suggest that exchanging
intergenerational support is part of the everyday fabric of
family life. Factors such as previous patterns of exchange,
family norms and affection may play critical roles in
shaping these everyday exchanges, while contingency
may drive support in times of increased need.
We considered the possibility that two of the support
items, socializing and talking about daily lives, might
represent a different type of support (companionship)
that would show a different pattern of exchange. We re-
ran our analyses without these two items and found re-
sults that were identical to the pattern observed with the
full scale.
Relation between the Total Amount of Support
Exchange and Disparities in Support Exchange on
Marital Satisfaction
In contrast to caregiving studies where the amount of
help given to a parent places strain on couples' marital
satisfaction [21], findings from this study showed no ef-
fects of the total amount of everyday support given by the
couple. In part, this finding is due to the fact that middle-
aged adults typically gave support on an intermittent ba-
sis, and the effects of giving may have been balanced by

Support with Aging Parents

receiving support in return from their parents. As noted,
middle-aged couples with more living parents also could
have adjusted their use of time and resources in providing
support.
On the other hand, disparities in the amount of sup-
port exchanged were associated with husbands' and
wives' marital satisfaction. Whether it was the wife or
husband, whichever spouse gave more support to parents
and received more from parents than the other spouse
reported lower marital satisfaction. These results are con-
sistent with prior evidence that married couples often
make comparisons between themselves regarding house
work and other family matters [24], and that perceived
unfairness in family work was negatively associated with
marital satisfaction [25, 26].
The literature has emphasized the effects of involve-
ment with parents on wives' marital satisfaction [20], but
we found husbands to be affected in a similar way. It is
also noteworthy that husbands and wives who gave less
support to their own parents compared to their spouse
reported higher marital satisfaction. They did not appear
resentful at their spouses' greater involvement with their
parents. An alternative explanation of the findings is that
spouses who are less satisfied with their marriage become
more involved in support exchanges with their aging par-
ents. In fact, studies have shown that unhappily married
couples tend to increase their contact with aging parents
for support and companionship [36, 37]. It may also be
that some husbands and wives had greater involvement
with parents from the outset of their own marriage, and
that the parents played a divisive role within the mar-
riage. These findings, of course, could be better under-
stood with longitudinal or prospective studies that inves-
tigate the link between disparity in support and marital
satisfaction.
In sum, these results underscore the importance of ex-
amining both members of the couple when considering
the implication of exchanges of support between middle-
aged adults and their parents. Further, our analysis re-
vealed that the disparity between spouses in the support
exchangedwithagingparentsratherthanthetotalamount
of support may have implications for their marriage.
Limitations
Several caveats should be considered in interpreting
the findings of this study. First, this sample came from a
single part of the country, the Philadelphia Metropolitan
Statistical Area. The sample is somewhat better educated
than middle-aged couples from a representative national
sample, but it is similar in many other characteristics. We
also cannot rule out the possibility of selection bias in
which spouses agreed to participate in the study.
While we had detailed information on the support
that middle-aged children gave to their own parents, we
do not know how much they may also have been support-
ing or receiving support from their in-laws. Previous re-
search suggests that intergenerational support is likely to
be influenced by consanguinity and long-term commit-
ments based on past reciprocities [38], but it is also known
that married daughters and, perhaps to a lesser extent,
married sons are also involved in providing support for
their parents-in-laws [39]. Information on the extent of
involvement that husbands and wives have with their
parents-in-law would make a more refined assessment of
the association between help given and received and cou-
ples' marital relationship.
Another limitation of this study is the measure of mar-
ital satisfaction. Although this 1-item marital satisfaction
scale has been widely used in survey research, it does not
have clinical norms associated with it. Thus, although the
findings indicate significant association between dispar-
ity in support and marital satisfaction, we do not know if
the magnitude reflects small or large differences in mar-
ital satisfaction.
Finally, because the research design was cross-section-
al, we were not able to test dynamic and bidirectional
relationships among the variables. Longitudinal studies
could clarify whether the support given to and received
from parents affects aspects of the couple's relationship
or if relationship qualities may drive patterns of intergen-
erational support.
