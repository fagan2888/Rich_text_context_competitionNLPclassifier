ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION
Overestimation of Chronic Disability
Among Elderly Persons
Thomas M. Gill, MD; Evelyne A. Gahbauer, MD, MPH
Background: Although there is no generally accepted
definition for the term short-term disability, chronic dis-
ability has been defined as disability lasting or expected
to last at least 90 days according to a protocol that was
established by the National Long-Term Care Survey. We
evaluated the validity of the established protocol and de-
termined the accuracy of prevalence estimates of chronic
disability among elderly persons in the United States.
Methods: Chronicdisabilitywasascertainedduringacom-
prehensive assessment using the established protocol. Par-
ticipantsweresubsequentlyclassifiedashavingchronicdis-
ability(thegoldstandard)basedonthepresenceofdisability
during consecutive monthly interviews immediately be-
fore or after the comprehensive assessment.
Results: Of the 552 participants, 120 (21.7%) met cri-
teria for chronic disability according to the established
protocol. Of these, 30 (25.0%) and 39 (32.5%) did not
meet criteria according to the gold standard under as-
sumptions that were favorable and unfavorable (ie, strin-
gent) to the established protocol, respectively. Con-
versely, of the 95 participants (17.2%) who met the gold
standard criteria for chronic disability according to the
favorable strategy and the 89 (16.1%) who met the cri-
teria according to the stringent strategy, 5 (5.3%) and 8
(9.0%), respectively, did not meet criteria for chronic dis-
ability according to the established protocol. Relative to
the established estimate of 7.0 million, our projections
yielded about 2.0 million fewer chronically disabled el-
derly Americans in 1999.
Conclusion: Our results threaten the validity of the cur-
rentlyestablishedprotocolforascertainingchronicdisabil-
ityandsuggestthattheburdenofchronicdisabilityamong
elderly Americans has been substantially overestimated.

IN A SERIES OF HIGHLY INFLUEN-
tial studies,1-3 Manton and col-
leagues, using data from the Na-
tional Long-Term Care Survey,
have demonstrated impressive re-
ductions over the past 2 decades in the
prevalence of chronic disability among el-
derly persons. Despite substantial growth
in the elderly population (from 26.9 mil-
lion in 1982 to 35.5 million in 1999), the
number of chronically disabled Ameri-
cans 65 years or older has decreased from
7.1 million to 7.0 million, leading to a rela-
tive reduction of nearly 25%. Although
these important findings have been widely
trumpeted in the medical literature4-6 and
the lay press,7 relatively little attention has
been given to how chronic disability was
actually assessed. Previous research has
shown that estimates of disability differ
considerably across national surveys for a
variety of reasons, including differences in
the way that disability is assessed.8-10
In the National Long-Term Care Sur-
vey, a chronic disability has been defined
as a disability lasting or expected to last
at least 90 days.1-3 For a series of essential
and instrumental activities of daily liv-
ing, persons indicating that they need help
(from another person or special equip-
ment) are subsequently asked whether
they have needed help for 3 months or
longer, expect to need help for the next 3
months or longer, or will have needed help
for 3 months or longer from beginning to
end. Because it is uncertain whether el-
derly persons can accurately recall the ex-
act onset of their disability, especially over
an extended period of time, or can esti-
mate the future duration of their disabil-
ity, we decided to formally evaluate the va-
lidity of this protocol for ascertaining
chronic disability.
To accomplish this objective, we used
data from a unique longitudinal study that
includes monthly assessments of disability
in activities of daily living from a large co-
hort of elderly persons.11,12 We postulated
that the protocol established by the Na-
tional Long-Term Care Survey, which was
implementedforthefirsttimeduringacom-

METHODS
STUDY POPULATION
Participants were members of the Precipitating Events Project,
an ongoing longitudinal study of 754 community-living per-
sons, 70 years or older, who were initially nondisabled in 4 es-
sential activities of daily living--bathing, dressing, walking in-
side the house, and transferring from a chair.13 The assembly
of the cohort has been described in detail elsewhere13; the par-
ticipation rate was 75.2%. Participants completed comprehen-
sive assessments at 18-month intervals and monthly tele-
phone interviews for the ascertainment of disability. The study
protocol was approved by the Yale Human Investigation Com-
mittee, and all participants provided verbal informed consent.
The analytic sample for the current study included partici-
pants who completed the comprehensive assessment at 54
months. Of the 754 participants, 166 (22.0%) had died before
the 54-month assessment, and 27 (3.6%) had dropped out of
the study after a median follow-up period of 22 months. Of the
remaining 561 participants, 3 (0.5%) refused to complete the
assessment, and 6 (1.1%) had incomplete information on their
disability status, leaving 552 participants in the analytic sample.
Compared with these participants, the 202 cohort members who
were not included in the analytic sample were (at baseline) older
(80.4 vs 77.7 years; P.001), had more chronic conditions (2.3
vs 1.7; P.001), and were more likely to be male (42.6% vs
32.8%; P=.01) and physically frail (59.9% vs 36.4%; P.001).
There were no significant baseline differences according to race
or ethnicity, living situation, education, or cognitive status.
DATA COLLECTION
The research nurses who completed the 54-month assessments
were kept blinded to the results of the monthly assessments. As
described in 2 earlier reports,11,13 the comprehensive assess-
ments and monthly telephone interviews were completed with a
designated proxy for participants with significant cognitive im-
pairment. At 54 months, 68 (12.3%) of the comprehensive as-
sessments were completed by a designated proxy.
54-MONTH ASSESSMENT
During the 54-month assessment, data were collected on liv-
ing situation; self-reported, physician-diagnosed chronic con-
ditions13; cognitive status as assessed by the Folstein Mini-
Mental State Examination14; and physical frailty, defined on the
basis of slow gait speed as previously described.15-17
Chronic disability, defined as disability lasting at least 90
days (ie, 3 months), was ascertained for the first time during
the 54-month assessment using the protocol established by the
National Long-Term Care Survey,2,3,18 hereafter referred to sim-
ply as the established protocol. To our knowledge, alternative
protocols for assessing chronic disability have not been re-
ported. For each of the 4 essential activities of daily living, par-
ticipants were asked, "At the present time, do you need help
from another person to (complete the task)?" Participants who
answered "No" were considered to be nondisabled for that task.
Participants who answered "Yes" were subsequently asked up
to 3 questions, shown in the following tabulation, to deter-
mine whether the disability was chronic.
Subtype Question
Previous 3 months Have you needed help (to complete the
task) for 3 months or longer?
Next 3 months Do you expect to need help (with the
task) for the next 3 months or
longer?
Combination All together, from beginning to end, will
you have needed help (with the task)
for 3 months or longer?
The criterion for chronic disability was met if participants
answered "Yes" to any of the 3 questions for 1 or more of the 4
activities of daily living. Among a subgroup of 28 participants
with chronic disability at 54 months, we found that only 1 (3.6%)
did not meet the criterion based on a subsequent telephone in-
terview that was completed independently within 5 days (mean,
1.8 days) by a second interviewer.
MONTHLY TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS
Complete details regarding the monthly assessments of dis-
ability, including formal tests of reliability and accuracy, are
provided elsewhere.11 During the monthly telephone inter-
views, participants were assessed for disability using standard
questions that were identical to those used during the com-
prehensive assessments. For each of the 4 essential activities
of daily living, we asked, "At the present time, do you need help
from another person to (complete the task)?" Participants who
needed help with any of the tasks were considered to be dis-
abled. Participants were not asked about eating, toileting, or
grooming. Disability in these activities of daily living is un-
common in the absence of disability in bathing, dressing, walk-
ing, or transferring from a chair15,16,19; hence, these omissions
will have little appreciable effect on our estimates of chronic
disability. The reliability of our disability assessment was sub-
stantial (=0.75) for reassessments completed within 48 hours
and excellent (=1.00) for reassessments performed the same
day.20 The accuracy of proxy reports, compared with reports
from cognitively intact participants, was also found to be ex-
cellent, with =1.00.11
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The prevalence of chronic disability was determined on the ba-
sis of the 54-month assessment, and the number of chroni-
cally disabled activities of daily living was tabulated. Partici-
pants with chronic disability were subsequently classified
according to the specific subtypes (shown in the tabulation in
the "54-Month Assessment" subsection).
The overall objective of our analysis was to determine the va-
lidity of the established protocol for ascertaining chronic disabil-
ity as implemented during the 54-month assessment. Data from
the monthly telephone interviews were used to define the gold
standard. Participants were classified as having chronic disabil-
itybasedonthepresenceofdisabilityduringconsecutivemonthly
telephone interviews immediately before or after the 54-month
assessment.12,21,22 To bolster the validity of the gold standard, we
evaluated a subgroup of 186 participants who had no disability
"at the present time" and found that only 2 (1.1%) reported dis-
ability "at any time during the last month." To be conservative,
we did not require that the subtype designation for the estab-
lished protocol match that for the gold standard. Because the tele-
phone interviews and 54-month assessments were completed in-
dependently of one another, the corresponding time intervals for
ascertaining chronic disability usually did not coincide per-
fectly, as illustrated in Table 1 (discussed in the next 2 subsec-
tions). Hence, we performed 2 sets of analyses, under assump-
tions that were initially favorable to the established protocol and,

subsequently, under assumptions that were more stringent, that
is,unfavorable.Theseassumptionsdiffereddependingonwhether
chronic disability was present or absent according to the estab-
lished protocol, as summarized in Table 2 and described in de-
tail in the next 2 subsections.
PRESENCE OF CHRONIC DISABILITY
ACCORDING TO ESTABLISHED PROTOCOL
For the favorable strategy, the gold standard for chronic dis-
ability required disability during consecutive telephone inter-
views for intervals that could have potentially spanned 90 days
or longer relative to the time of the 54-month assessment. For
the stringent strategy, the gold standard required disability dur-
ing consecutive telephone interviews for intervals of at least 90
days. To illustrate, for the first subtype of "previous 3 months"
in Table 1, the gold standard required disability during months
52 to 54 for the favorable strategy and months 51 to 54 for the
stringent strategy. For the second subtype of "next 3 months,"
the gold standard required disability during months 55 to 57
for each of the 2 strategies. For the third subtype of "combi-
nation," the gold standard required disability in consecutive
months during any interval within 90 days of the 54-month
assessment. This included months 52 to 54, 53 to 55, 54 to 56,
or 55 to 57 for the favorable strategy and months 52 to 55, 53
to 56, or 54 to 57 for the stringent strategy.
ABSENCE OF CHRONIC DISABILITY
ACCORDING TO ESTABLISHED PROTOCOL
In contrast, for this scenario the gold standard for chronic dis-
ability required disability during consecutive telephone inter-
views for intervals of at least 90 days relative to the time of the
54-month assessment for the favorable strategy and for inter-
vals that could have potentially spanned 90 days or longer for
the stringent strategy. To illustrate, in the last 2 columns of
Table 1, the gold standard was achieved if disability was pres-
ent during months 51 to 54, 52 to 55, 53 to 56, 54 to 57, or 55
to 58 for the favorable strategy and during months 52 to 54,
53 to 55, 54 to 56, or 55 to 57 for the stringent strategy. For
both strategies, participants needed to report disability in 1 or
more of the 4 essential activities of daily living during the 54-
month assessment because this served as the reference point
for the gold standard. Of the 432 participants who were non-
disabled at 54 months, only 1 (0.2%) reported disability in the
month immediately before and the month immediately follow-
ing the 54-month assessment.
ESTIMATES OF CHRONIC DISABILITY
ACCORDING TO ESTABLISHED PROTOCOL
AND GOLD STANDARD
The validity of the established protocol for chronic disability
was determined relative to the gold standard definitions for the
favorable and stringent strategies, respectively. The 2 metrics
of validity were sensitivity and specificity, which were de-
fined, per convention, as the ability of the established proto-
col to correctly identify the presence (ie, true positive) and ab-
sence (ie, true negative) of chronic disability, respectively.23
These values, together with the prevalence of chronic disabil-
ity from the 54-month assessment, were used to estimate the
number of chronically disabled elderly Americans in 1999 ac-
cording to the gold standard definitions, through a series of cal-
culations (available on request) that required the use of posi-
tive and negative predictive values. According to the established
protocol, the number of chronically disabled elderly Ameri-
cans in 1999 was 7.0 million, as determined by the National
Long-Term Care Survey.3
Because our intent was to compare assessments at monthly
intervals (ie, gold standard) with participants' reports over these

same intervals (ie, established protocol), our estimates should
not be affected appreciably by differences in the characteris-
tics of the 2 study populations, the specific activities of daily
living evaluated, or the methods used to define disability as long
as the rates of chronic disability are comparable in our study
and the National Long-Term Care Survey. Unlike sensitivity
and specificity, positive and negative predictive values are highly
dependent on the prevalence of the specific disorder.23
All analyses were performed using the statistical software
SAS (version 8.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
The characteristics of the analytic sample, at the time of
the 54-month assessment, are shown in Table 3. The
majority of participants were white women who did not
live alone; about half were physically frail.
Of the 552 participants, 120 (21.7%) met criteria
for chronic disability according to the established pro-
tocol. The mean (SD) number of chronically disabled
activities of daily living was 2.1 (1.2); the most com-
monly disabled tasks were bathing (n=95; 79.2%) and
dressing (n=73; 60.8%). The most common subtype
designation (per the tabulation in the "54-Month
Assessment" subsection in the "Methods" section),
involving 234 (93.6%) of the 250 chronically disabled
activities of daily living, was "previous 3 months." The
subtype designation was "next 3 months" for 11 tasks
(4.4%) and "combination" for 5 tasks (2.0%). Only 4
(3.3%) and 2 (1.7%) of the participants with chronic
disability, respectively, met criteria based exclusively
on the latter 2 subtype designations.
Of the 120 participants who met criteria for chronic
disabilityaccordingtotheestablishedprotocol,30(25.0%)
and 39 (32.5%) did not meet criteria according to the gold
standard definitions for the favorable and stringent strat-
egies, respectively (Table 4). Conversely, of the 95 par-
ticipants who met criteria for chronic disability accord-
ing to the favorable strategy and the 89 participants who
met criteria according to the stringent strategy, 5 (5.3%)
and 8 (9.0%), respectively, did not meet criteria for chronic
disability according to the established protocol. The sen-
sitivity and specificity of the established protocol, rela-
tive to the gold standard, were 94.7% and 93.4% for the
favorable strategy and 91.0% and 91.6% for the strin-
gent strategy. Based on these values, the number of chroni-
cally disabled elderly Americans in 1999 was reduced from
7.0 million according to the established protocol to 5.3
million for the favorable strategy and 4.8 million for the
stringent strategy (Table 4).
COMMENT
Using data from a unique longitudinal study, we found
that up to a third of elderly persons deemed to have
chronic disability and 1 of 11 deemed not to have chronic
disability were misclassified by the protocol established
for use in the National Long-Term Care Survey.1 Rela-
tive to the published estimate of 7.0 million,3 our pro-
jections yielded about 2.0 million fewer chronically dis-
abled elderly Americans in 1999. These results threaten
the validity of the currently established protocol for as-
certaining chronic disability and suggest that the bur-
den of chronic disability among elderly Americans has
been substantially overestimated.
Accurate estimates of chronic disability are impor-
tant for several reasons. From a policy perspective, these
estimates are often used to inform decisions regarding
the current and future health care needs of elderly per-
sons and to forecast the likely demand for long-term
care.24-26 From an epidemiological perspective, the eti-
ology of chronic disability, including predisposing risk
factors and subsequent precipitants, may differ from that
of short-term disability.27 Finally, from a personal per-
spective, the likelihood of recovery is considerably lower
for a person with a chronic disability than for a person
with a short-term disability,12 and chronic disability likely
confers a higher risk of subsequent morbidity and mor-
tality.
Although our results suggest that prevalence esti-
mates of chronic disability have been spuriously in-
flated, they do not refute the relative reductions in chronic
disability that have been documented over the past 2 de-
cades. The protocol established to ascertain chronic dis-
ability in the National Long-Term Care Survey has been
used consistently from 1982 to 1999.3 Moreover, sev-
eral other studies, which have evaluated any disability
rather than chronic disability, have demonstrated rela-
tive reductions of comparable magnitude during this time
period.5,28 These reductions have been documented most
consistently for disability in essential activities of daily
living, defined, as in our study, as the need for personal
assistance.10
We have previously reported11 that the occurrence of
disability has been underestimated by longitudinal stud-
ies with long assessment intervals. A likely explanation
for these seemingly disparate findings, with overestima-

tion of chronic disability prevalence but underestima-
tion of disability occurrence, is the high rate of recovery
among newly disabled elderly persons.12,29 Increasingly,
disability has been viewed as a dynamic process, often
characterized by multiple recurrent episodes rather than
an enduring condition or progressive disorder.27,29 Our
results indicate that many elderly persons cannot accu-
rately estimate the duration of their disability episodes.
Despite differences in study populations and methods
used to define disability, the established protocol yielded
a rate of chronic disability in the current study (21.7%)
that was comparable to that in the 1999 National Long-
Term Care Survey (19.7%). Comparable rates enhance the
likelihood that our projections are accurate.23 Over-
sampling persons who were physically frail undoubtedly
led to a higher rate of chronic disability, whereas our more
narrowly focused definition of disability, which required
personal assistance in at least 1 of 4 essential activities of
daily living, likely led to a lower rate. Had we used a more
expansive definition of disability that included instrumen-
tal activities of daily living or the need for special equip-
ment,thevalidityoftheestablishedprotocolmayhavebeen
diminished further.8-10
To address the modest asynchrony in time periods be-
tween the established protocol and monthly telephone
interviews, we considered 2 gold standard definitions for
chronic disability. Hence, our results provide upper and
lower bounds for the number of chronically disabled el-
derly Americans. Because we could not account for the
complex sample design of the National Long-Term Care
Survey, these estimates should be interpreted cau-
tiously. Our primary intent was to rigorously evaluate the
validity of the currently established protocol for ascer-
taining chronic disability rather than to generate pre-
cise population-based estimates of chronic disability.
Even though it is difficult, if not impossible, to ex-
clude the possibility of measurement error, we believe
that it is an unlikely explanation for our findings be-
cause our disability assessments were highly reliable, our
rate of proxy reports was lower than that reported in the
National Long-Term Care Survey,30 and the accuracy of
our proxy reports was high. Although our participants
are older than those in the National Long-Term Care Sur-
vey, there is no evidence that the accuracy of self-
reported disability differs by age in the absence of cog-
nitive impairment. Further reducing the possibility of bias,
our 2 strategies for ascertaining chronic disability were
completed independently of one another in the context
of an ongoing longitudinal study. Our results cannot be
attributed to underreporting of disability during the
monthly telephone interviews because individuals who
report no disability at the present time are unlikely to
have had any disability during the past month.
In summary, the results of our study suggest that preva-
lence estimates of chronic disability have been spuri-
ously inflated. Given the dynamic nature of disability, new
strategies are needed to adequately capture the true bur-
den of chronic disability among elderly persons.
