Abstract
The deleterious effects of anemia on auditory nerve (AN) development have been well investigated; however, we have
previously reported that significant functional consequences in the auditory brainstem response (ABR) can also occur as a
consequence of marginal iron deficiency (ID). As the ABR has widespread clinical use, we evaluated the ability of this
electrophysiological method to characterize the threshold of tissue ID in rats by examining the relationship between markers
of tissue ID and severity of ABR latency defects. To generate various levels of ID, female Long-Evans rats were exposed to
diets containing sufficient, borderline, or deficient iron (Fe) concentrations throughout gestation and offspring lifetime. We
measured hematological indices of whole body iron stores in dams and offspring to assess the degree of ID. Progression of
AN ID in the offspring was measured as ferritin protein levels at different times during postnatal development to complement
ABR functional measurements. The severity of ABR deficits correlated with the level of Fe restriction in each diet. The
sufficient Fe diet did not induce AN ID and consequently did not show an impaired ABR latency response. The borderline Fe
diet, which depleted AN Fe stores but did not cause systemic anemia resulted in significantly increased ABR latency isolated
to Peak I.The low Fe diet, which induced anemia and growth retardation, significantly increased ABR latencies of Peaks I to IV.
Our findings indicate that changes in the ABR could be related to various degrees of ID experienced throughout
development.

Introduction
Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common micronutrient
deficiency in the world and is especially prevalent during
early brain development, particularly as daily iron
requirements triple by the third trimester (World Health
Organization, 2001). Iron serves many functions in the
body both systemically, as well as on a tissue specific
level. In the central nervous system (CNS), iron is an
essential cofactor for many enzymes including those
involved in energy metabolism, neurotransmitter synthe-
sis, and the process of myelination (Conrad et al., 2000;
Rao et al., 2003; Eden, 2005; Brotanek et al., 2007; Tran
et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2008; Collard, 2009;
Todorich et al., 2009; Tran et al., 2009; Kumari et al.,
2012; Tran et al., 2012; Callahan et al., 2013; Polin et al.,
2013; Radlowski and Johnson, 2013; Rao et al., 2013).
Therefore, the impact of ID during vulnerable periods of
neurodevelopment can be significant, and early gesta-
tional ID has been associated with abnormalities in neur-
onal development in both children and animals (Felt and
Lozoff, 1996; Lozoff, 2000; Algarin et al., 2003; Walter,

Similar to other nutritional deficiencies, ID occurs as a
spectrum beginning with tissue iron store depletion and,
if unsupplemented, progressing to impaired erythropoi-
esis or anemia (Connor et al., 2001; Collard, 2009; Ganz,
2013). All stages of maternal ID have been associated
with adverse effects on the offspring, but only the most
severe stage of ID can be reliably diagnosed via maternal
blood or cord blood samples (Scholl and Reilly, 2000;
Gambling et al., 2003; Lisle et al., 2003; Gambling
et al., 2004; Andersen et al., 2006; Felt et al., 2006;
Zhou et al., 2006; Zimmermann et al., 2007; Banhidy
et al., 2010). Marginal maternal iron intake leads to low
fetal Fe levels in CNS tissue but is below the threshold of
generating anemia. This stage of marginal ID is clinically
difficult to diagnose and remains for the most part unde-
tected. This is of great concern as infants born with
suboptimal iron stores may be at a greater risk of
impaired neural maturation. Therefore, there is a para-
mount need for diagnostic neurofunctional screening that
could identify low CNS iron stores, despite normal sys-
temic clinical endpoints.
Global behavioral tests often shed little information
on the specific abnormalities produced by developmental
insults. The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a non-
invasive technique that provides objective measurement
of auditory thresholds and neuronal transmission speed
along the auditory pathway from the end-organ to the
brainstem and higher auditory cortex (Jougleux et al.,
2011). Signal processing begins in the cochlea, which
functionality can be determined by the distortion-product
otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) amplitudes. Changes in
DPOAEs indicate damage to outer or inner hair cells,
which are responsible for loss of auditory thresholds. In
the absence of haircell damage, signal processing and
conduction velocity are mainly dependent on axon diam-
eter, myelination, and synapse integrity of the auditory
nerve (AN; Lasky et al., 1995; Cankaya et al., 2003). In
contrast to techniques that measure overall developmen-
tal delays, which could be the result of multiple factors,
the ABR is advantageous because it provides localized
functional measures at multiple synapse levels along the
CNS pathway (Moore, 1987; Angulo-Kinzler et al.,
2002). The series of nuclei involved in AN transmission
are represented by the number and amplitude of individ-
ual wave components that vary by age and species (Jerger
and Hall, 1980; Corwin et al., 1982; Moore, 1987; Jiang
et al., 1991). Peak I (PI) represents the activity of the AN
nerve, whereas Peaks III to V are associated with higher
auditory CNS centers such as the inferior colliculi (PIII)
and auditory brainstem (PV) (Moore, 1987). Absolute
latency of these waves or peaks can be measured, as
well as the interpeak intervals, which are used to calculate
the speed of transmission (Warren, 1989).
While the ABR is employed as a diagnostic tool for
speech and language learning deficits (Coenraad et al.,
2011; Li et al., 2011; McCandless, 2011; Marcoux,
2011), its value to determine impairments associated
with ID in humans remains unclear. Some studies have
found significant changes in the ABR response in ID
infants (Roncagliolo et al., 1998, 2000; Algarin et al.,
2003; Cankaya et al., 2003; Jorgenson et al., 2005;
Lozoff et al., 2006; Amin and Guillet, 2007; Amin
et al., 2010; Madan et al., 2011), while others found no
such correlation (Sarici et al., 2001; Kurekci et al., 2006;
Berglund et al., 2011). The discrepancies are likely due to
differences in severity or duration of ID in the cohorts
examined. Support for this comes from various animal
studies where we and others have found that both severe
as well as marginal ID affect the ABR response and that
the impairment was greater when the ID occurs at the
onset of pregnancy and thus affects the early states of
gestation (Jougleux et al., 2011; Mihaila et al., 2011;
Lee et al., 2012). As these studies employed different
animal strains and different feeding paradigms that lead
to various degree of ID, it remains difficult to draw firm
conclusions about the degree of ID and the resulting
impact on the ABR.
The goals of this study presented here were twofold:
(a) we wanted to determine the threshold of ID during
gestation and postnatal development that would be
severe enough to induce CNS tissue ID but would not
result in systemic anemia in the offspring, and (b) we
aimed to evaluate whether the various degrees of ID
established in the offspring would have a corresponding
impact on their ABR profiles.
To achieve this, we employed an animal model in
which we could keep the time of exposure constant but
were able to manipulate the degree of ID. We found
that functional responses to the variable iron diets cor-
related well with both the absolute concentration of
iron in the diet and the molecular indicators of tissue
ID. We also found that ABR profiling was a sensitive
tool to detect possible brain maturation impairments in
the offspring even if a clinical state of ID anemia was
not indicated.
Materials and Methods
Animal Handling and Diets
Female Long-Evans rats (8 weeks) from Charles River
Laboratories, (Wilmington, MA) were pair housed in
plastic filter-top cages on corn-cob bedding
(Pur-o'Cel, Maumee, OH) under humidity and tem-
perature controlled conditions (12 hr light/dark cycle).
Animals were housed in a facility accredited by the
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care with all protocols approved
by the University Committee on Animal Resources at
the University of Rochester. For enrichment, females
2 ASN Neuro
and their offspring were given cotton square nestlets
with every cage change throughout the study. Starting
2 weeks prior to breeding and continuing throughout
gestation and lactation, females were fed ad libitum an
iron-sufficient (IS) diet containing 240 mg Fe/g diet
or one of three iron-deficient diets (IDDs) containing
6, 20, and 30 mg Fe/g, respectively (Harlan
Laboratories, see Supplemental Material Table S1).
At 11 weeks of age, females were bred to age-matched
Long-Evans males, and the presence of vaginal plugs
was considered indicative of pregnancy and considered
gestational day (GD) 1. Weight was recorded on GD1
and measured as a percentage of GD1 weight gain at
GD7, 14, and 18.
At delivery, litter size was recorded and offspring
were weighed at postnatal day (P) P7, 14, 21, and 40.
Pups were weaned at P21 and provided lifetime ad lib-
itum access to the same respective diet as their dam
until sacrifice. Offspring of dams fed the IS diet or
ID diet (6, 20, or 30 mg Fe/g) are designated as the
IS group (total of 8 litters) or IDD group (total of
30 mg Fe/g ¼ 4, 20 mg Fe/g ¼ 4, and 6 mg Fe/g ¼ 3 litters),
respectively. Analyses were performed on offspring of
mixed sex, with equal numbers of each sex used per
endpoint, where possible.
Hematological Analysis
Dams at GD15 were lightly anesthetized with isofluor-
ane and restrained while blood ($100 mL) was extracted
from the jugular vein into EDTA coated tubes.
Offspring were asphyxiated with carbon dioxide
(CO2
), and whole trunk blood was collected after
decapitation at P14, 21, and 40 into potassium-EDTA
coated microtubes. Hematocrit (HCT) and hemoglobin
(HGB) were analyzed according to the manufacture's
guidelines (HeskaÕ, Loveland, CO) with experimental
controls used for reference values.
Western Blot Analysis
For tissue harvest, animals were asphyxiated with CO2
, at
P14, 21, and 40, rapidly decapitated, and the cochlea
separated from the tympanic bulla and otic capsule.
Both cochlea from each animal were combined and mech-
anically lysed in two volumes of XDP lysis buffer and one
volume of 0.5 mm glass beads (Next Advance, Averill
Park, NY). Lysates were centrifuged, and the protein,
which represents at that stage mainly the AN, was
separated and stored at À80C until analyses. Protein
concentration was determined using the DCTM Protein
Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and samples
(35 mg) were resolved on 4% to 12% bis-tris NuPage
gels (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Membranes were
probed for anti-ferritin heavy chain (FTH; 1:1000
dilution) for 16 hr at 4C (Cell Signaling Technology
#3998, Danvers, MA). Immunoreactive proteins were
quantified by densitometry using ImageJ software
(NIH, Bethesda, MD). Samples were normalized to
b-Actin as a loading control and displayed as a ratio
to age-matched IS control tissue. Different tissue sam-
ples were used for each diet group for each replicate
Western blot comparison.
Auditory Brainstem Response
Testing of the ABR was performed on P40 offspring of
each diet. This age was chosen as our previous rodent
models of moderate ID showed a significant decrease in
neuronal conduction velocity specifically at this age (Lee
et al., 2012). Offspring were lightly sedated using a keta-
mine (6 mg/kg BW)/xylazine (0.5 mg/kg BW) mix for a
period of $1 hr. Thermal regulation of body temperature
was achieved using a heating pad during testing sessions.
ABR waveforms were evoked with trapezoidal wave pure
tone pips at 30 cycles per second, delivered at frequencies
of 8, 16, and 32 kHz (optimal hearing range in rats;
Heffner and Heffner, 2007) at 70 decibels (dB SPL),
through high-frequency transducers at a distance of
5 cm at a perpendicular angle to the left pinna.
Subdermal needle electrodes (Platinum 10 mm, 30 gauge
monopolar; Grass Technologies, Middleton, WI) were
inserted at the cranial vertex, and in the muscle posterior
to the left pinna, with a ground electrode placed in the
gluteus maximus muscle. Responses from the left ear
were amplified (10,000Â), filtered (100 Hz­3 kHz), and
averaged using the SmartEP data-acquisition software
(Intelligent Hearing Systems, Miami, FL). In total,
1,024 responses were averaged (with alternating stimulus
polarity) using an ``artifact reject'' that discards
responses when peak-to-peak amplitude exceeds 15 mV
as previously described (Jones et al., 2006). Left ear-
only recordings were chosen for this study, as multiple
previous experiments showed no evidence of unilateral
effects due to ID on ABR responses (unpublished
observation).
Statistical Analyses
Data were appropriately transformed if analysis indi-
cated significant deviation from normality or equal
variance. Statistical analysis of endpoints was done
using one-way (within age or diet) or two-way analysis
of variance (Age Â Diet or Diet Â Frequency) where
appropriate and, in the presence of significant main
effects or interactions (p < .05), post hoc tests (Holm-
Sidak) were used to determine the nature of the effect.
Multiple comparisons between diets in post hoc tests
were limited to comparison to IS controls within age
or frequency.

Results
Dietary Iron Availability Only Mildly Affects the
Pregnant Dam
We found no significant effect of any diet on gestational
weight gain or HGB concentrations 1 week before
delivery (Table 1). There were no significant differences
in the amount of diet consumed, and administration of
the purified diets resulted in a gestational average daily
intake of 4.4, 0.498, 0.350, and 0.113 mg Fe for the 240,
30, 20, and 6 mg Fe/g diets, respectively. However, the
6 mg Fe/g IDD significantly reduced HCT by approxi-
mately 14% in the IDD-6 dams relative to all the other
groups (p < .05). The pregnancy outcome was not
affected by any of the diets with respect to litter size,
gestational length, or gender distribution.
There was, however, a significant difference in off-
spring postnatal mortality, the 6 mg Fe/g IDD compared
with all other groups (p < .05), with almost 50% of off-
spring expiring before the conclusion of the study at P40.
Weight Gain and Hematological Outcomes in the
Offspring Are More Sensitive to Changes in Dietary
Iron Concentrations Than in Dams
Intake of a diet containing 240, 30, or 20 mg Fe/g during
pregnancy, weaning, and early postnatal growth leads to
a nearly 10-fold increase in body weight from P14 to P21
(main effect of age p < .001). We found a significant diet
by age interaction (p < .001), indicating that the impact of
age on postnatal weight is dependent on the diet group.
In contrast, if the diet contained only 6 mg Fe/g, the off-
spring showed significant growth retardation that wor-
sened with age. Surviving pups showed 20% to 70%
reduction in body weight relative to the IS control
group from P14 to P40, respectively (Figure 1(a)).
Both HCT and HGB values significantly increased
with age in the 240 mg Fe/g control diet (main effect of
age p < .001, diet by age interaction p < .001). We did
observe a treatment-related effect on HCT and HGB
levels at P14 and P21 with respect to the intermediate
diets (30 and 20 mg Fe/g diet; Figure 1(b) and (c)).
However, these decreases were both mild and transient
as they completely recovered by P40, relative to IS off-
spring. This compensation occurred despite remaining on
the same respective deficient diets during this time.
In line with the dramatic lack of weight gain and
increased offspring mortality, the 6 mg Fe/g IDD dis-
played progressive decreases in both HCT and HGB
values by 60% to 80% relative to IS offspring from P14
to P40, indicating severe anemia (Figure 1(b) and (c)).
Tissue Ferritin Levels Correlate Well but
Not Precisely With Hematological Iron
Availability Indicators
To determine whether the easy to obtain and generally
used HCT and HGB provide a useful correlate for CNS
tissue iron stores, particularly with respect to ABR meas-
urements, we quantified tissue ferritin levels in the ANs of
the offspring in each dietary group. As shown in
Figure 2(a), tissue ferritin levels in the ANs were not

compared with the IS group (diet: p < .05; Figure 2(b))
at all ages. Interestingly, at P40 tissue, iron levels in the
AN were still decreased compared with controls, while
hematological parameters recovered at this time point.
In the IDD-6 mg Fe/g group, ferritin protein expression
was reduced in response to both diet (p < .001) and age
(p < .001). There was also a significant diet by age inter-
action (p < .001), and the AN displayed a nearly 90% loss
of ferritin protein expression by P40 (Figure 2(c)).

Associations Between Tissue Ferritin Levels of
the AN and Associated ABR Latencies
To test the hypothesis that AN tissue iron depletion is a
prerequisite for ABR impairments, we performed ABR
analyses on P40 offspring of each diet. This age was
chosen as our previous rodent models of moderate ID
showed a significant decrease in neuronal conduction vel-
ocity specifically at this age (Lee et al., 2012). As shown in
Figure 3, iron depletion in the AN was accompanied by
significantly increased absolute latency of Peak I (PI)
compared with the iron-normal AN. We observed a
diet by frequency interaction (p < .001) indicating that
the effect of diet on Peak I latency is frequency-
dependent.
The 30 mg Fe/g IDD that did not reduce AN ferritin
levels also was not associated with any significant latency
changes in any peaks measured (Figure 3(b), Table 2).
Offspring in the 20 mg Fe/g IDD group displayed sig-
nificant latency defects in a frequency specific manner.
Specifically, PI latency was increased by 5% to 10% at
8 kHz and 16 kHz compared with both the IS group and
the 30 mg Fe/g IDD group. In this group, the latency
defects were restricted to Peak I, except for Peak V at 8
and 32 kHz (which were slightly [7­8%] increased) but
did not result in increased PV to PI interpeak latencies
(Table 2) because of the proportional increase in PI
latency (Figure 3(b)).
Offspring in the 6 mg Fe/g diet group displayed signifi-
cantly increased PI latency by 15% to 27% at all three
stimulus frequencies compared with all other groups
(p < .05) (Figure 3(b)). In addition to the anemia induced
by the 6 mg Fe/g IDD, the absolute latencies of Peaks II to
V were significantly increased by 18% to 36% depending
on the peak and stimulus frequency. The 6 mg Fe/g IDD
also significantly increased the interpeak latency of PII to
I, indicating some disruption in the myelination status of
the AN, as well as increased PV to I latencies indicating
an overall defect in brainstem maturation (Table 2).
Discussion
Although ID is a persistent public health problem and its
impact on the developing CNS has been acknowledged,
the lack of insight into the time period during which the
fetus was exposed to ID makes it challenging to predict or
diagnose the severity of CNS maturation defects
(Idjradinata and Pollitt, 1993; Lozoff and Georgieff,
2006; Lee et al., 2012; Pisansky et al., 2013). Maternal
or cord blood hematological parameters give an indica-
tion of the acute status of iron availability in blood but
are not useful to determine the time of onset of ID or the
CNS tissue iron levels. The analysis of the ABR profile
has been used as a surrogate functional readout that is
intended to report the maturation state of the brain;
however, conflicting results in the context of ID have
raised questions as to the strength of influence that ID
imparts on the ABR response. A partial answer to this
question is provided by our previous study (Mihaila
et al., 2011), where we show in rats that if exposure to
ID occurs during the later stages of pregnancy, the ABR
remains normal in the offspring, even if the offspring is
highly anemic and displays a low birth weight. In con-
trast, the ABR was significantly affected if the ID

occurred at the beginning of pregnancy (Mihaila et al.,
2011). As that study was designed to induce anemia in all
offspring, it was impossible to clearly separate the impact
of iron depletion from the impact of acute anemia, a
question we approached in our previous study by Lee
et al (2012). There we showed in a different rat strain
that lifetime exposure to marginal ID was associated
with morphological and functional defects of the AN
and results in impaired ABR responses specifically in
the absolute latency of Peak I. The limitation of this
study was, however, that we only induced a very mild
non anemic ID in the offspring.
As our two previous studies and additional published
reports from others are not directly comparable due to
different rat strains and diets, the goal of the present
study was hence to determine whether the ABR could
be utilized to detect the threshold of tissue ID in offspring
exposed to lifetime ID ranging from mild to severe. This
study revealed several novel findings: (a) ABR latency is
impaired by mild ID that is initiated early in pregnancy
and sustained during development even at levels that
never reach a state of clinical ID anemia in the offspring.
(b) The severity of biochemical responses to progressive
iron restriction does not appear to follow a linear rela-
tionship and may indicate a dietary threshold for induc-
tion of anemia. (c) The profile of ABR latency defects
resulting from moderate AN tissue ID is localized pri-
marily to Peak I, in contrast to the broad multipeak
latency defects generated by acute anemia occurring
during this window of vulnerability. Taken together,
these data might be relevant to humans in that they sug-
gest that ABR latency defects in infants may indicate
exposure to maternal ID that is initiated during the
early stages of gestation and sustained during develop-
ment. Perhaps even more important, the data also indi-
cate that the absence of anemia in infants might not
predict the absence of ID-induced maturation defects.
A novel aspect of our study is the systematic analysis
of the biochemical progression of ID in an ABR relevant
tissue. As the AN is too small to conduct mass spectros-
copy for elementary Fe content, we used tissue ferritin as
a surrogate marker for iron homeostasis. Several studies
support that ferritin levels are a sensitive and specific
marker of CNS iron homeostasis, and reliably decrease
to facilitate the release of available cellular Fe stores (Han
et al., 2000; Tran et al., 2002). The side by side analysis of
hematological parameters and AN tissue iron status
revealed some unexpected results. We were surprised by
the disconnection between HCT, HGB, and tissue ferritin
levels in the 30 mg Fe/g IDD; during the typical progres-

HCT and HGB. This disconnect might suggest that these
slight hematological changes were not related to
decreased iron availability but were a result of a slight
delay in blood volume expansion to accompany the sig-
nificant growth spurts that occur in weanling rats during
this time (Eisen, 1976). This possibility is consistent with
the observation that the decreases in HCT and HGB were
mild and transient with a complete recovery by P40 with-
out any supplementation and that no statistically signifi-
cant differences were observed in postnatal growth
between the two midlevel ID and the IS diet group.
The 20 mg Fe/g iron diet had an identical hemato-
logical profile as the 30 mg Fe/g but produced significantly
lower ferritin levels in the AN. This might suggest that
the threshold for maintaining iron saturation of the AN
lies below 30 ppm dietary Fe and represents a tissue
specific iron requirement. We have previously shown
that ID affects the CNS in a highly region specific
manner with some regions displaying far less sensitivity
to iron depletion than others (Greminger et al., 2014).
Interestingly, the ferritin levels remained constant over
time despite a continuous 20 mg Fe/g iron diet, suggesting
that the AN ferritin levels are relatively resilient to iron
depletion.
In light of the ferritin profile in the 6 mg Fe/g, it seems
that the threshold between AN tissue ID and anemia lies
between 20 and 6 mg Fe/g dietary iron. It needs to be
stressed that results of the 6 mg Fe/g diet may actually
underestimate the effect of anemia on the ABR in the
Long-Evans rat strain, as approximately 50% of the off-
spring in this diet group did not survive to the testing age,
removing the most severely affected rats from our ana-
lysis and likely attenuating the latency defect. A limita-
tion of our study here is that we focused on the most
frequently used HCT and HGB values to relate the per-
ipheral state of ID to the iron status in the AN. We can
thus not exclude the possibility that serum ferritin or
transferrin levels would have provided a better peripheral
surrogate measurement for AN maturation defects than
HCT and HGB. While outside the scope of this study, it
will be important in future studies to examine suitable
surrogate measurement that more reliably predict CNS
tissue iron levels.
Our result on the impact of various levels of ID on the
ABR response also raises the question of the underlying
``anatomical locus'' of pathology that results in impaired
ABR responses. While the ABR profiles allow exclusion
of cochlea defects on the level of haircell function, we
cannot deduct from our study which anatomical defect
contributed to the Peak I latency impairments in the bor-
derline versus severe ID diet. On the basis of our previous
findings (Mihaila et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2012), we suggest
that the underlying pathology in the borderline diet is due
to a defect in axon maturation with no impairment in
myelination. In contrast, the underlying pathology for
Peak I latency in the more severe anemia inducing diet
might contain an additional component of defective
myelination.
In summary, our study suggests that lifetime exposure
to ID results in impaired ABR. The severity of the ABR
impairment seems to reflect the severity of the ID, which
in our study ranged from borderline ID to systemic
anemia. The impact of even mild ID on the ABR is of
particular clinical concern as mild ID without reaching
stages of anemia might go undetected. As the CNS tissue
ID in infants is difficult to deduct and commonly used
hematological parameters do not reliably reflect CNS
iron levels, we suggest that ABR analysis might be a
useful tool to retrospectively determine whether an
infant might have been exposed to ID during gestation
even if no signs of maternal of infant anemia can be
established.
Summary
Iron deficiency significantly impacts neuronal function in
the absence of persistent anemia. We show that auditory
brainstem response analysis identified the threshold of
iron deficiency in the rat central nervous system and sup-
port the need for evaluation of its diagnostic potential in
at-risk children.
