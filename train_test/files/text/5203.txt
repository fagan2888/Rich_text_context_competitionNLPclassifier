Abstract
Objectives: To develop and evaluate a protein microarray assay with horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) chemiluminescence for quantification of a-fetoprotein (AFP) in serum from patients with
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Methods: A protein microarray assay for AFP was developed. Serum was collected from patients
with HCC and healthy control subjects. AFP was quantified using protein microarray and enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Results: Serum AFP concentrations determined via protein microarray were positively correlated
(r¼ 0.973) with those determined via ELISA in patients with HCC (n¼ 60) and healthy control subjects
(n¼ 30). Protein microarray showed 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity for HCC diagnosis. ELISA had
83.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Protein microarray effectively distinguished between patients
with HCC and healthy control subjects (area under ROC curve 0.974; 95% CI 0.000, 1.000).
Conclusion: Protein microarray is a rapid, simple and low-cost alternative to ELISA for detecting
AFP in human serum.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third
leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.1 It
occurs predominantly in Asia and Africa,
although its incidence is steadily increasing
throughout the rest of the world.2 Early stage
HCC is asymptomatic but advanced disease
has a poor prognosis, therefore early detec-
tion is critical. HCC serum tumour markers
include a-fetoprotein (AFP), AFP-L3, des-g-
carboxyprothrombin (DCP) and golgi pro-
tein 73 (GP73), with AFP being the most
widely used marker.3,4
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) is successfully used in the detection
of AFP,5,6 but requires costly commercial
kits. An alternative methodology is protein
microarray with horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-linked chemiluminescence. The HRP
chemiluminescent reaction is based on the
catalyzed oxidation of luminol by peroxide,
producing light.7 HRP is currently used in
numerous diverse industrial and medical
applications, such as waste-water treatment,8
chemical synthesis, coupled enzyme assays,
biosensors, diagnostic kits and
immunoassays.9,10
This study reports the development and
application of protein microarrays with
HRP chemiluminescence to detect AFP in
serum from patients with HCC and healthy
control subjects.
Participants and methods
Study population
The study recruited patients with HCC who
underwent liver resection surgery at the
Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery,
Beijing You'an Hospital, Beijing, China
between 1 January 2014 and 31 July 2014.
Patients were required to be positive for
serum hepatitis B surface antigen and free
from chronic hepatitis C infection. HCC
diagnosis was histologically confirmed after
surgical resection. Healthy control subjects
were recruited from volunteers with no
reported gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary
disease who were undergoing routine health
screening at the outpatient department of
Beijing You'an Hospital, Beijing, China.
The study protocol was approved by the
ethics committee of Beijing You'an Hospital.
Written informed consent was obtained from
all participants prior to enrolment in the
study.
Blood collection
Whole blood (1 ml) was collected from each
subject. Blood was allowed to clot, centri-
fuged at 3000g for 10 min at 4C, and the
resulting serum was stored at À70C. Prior
to use, serum was diluted 1 : 4 with 0.05%
PBS-Tween 20 (pH 7.5) and stored at 4C
for a maximum of 7 days.
Microarray preparation
Reaction wells were created by attaching
slips of hydrophobic paper (10 holes
per slip) to aldehyde-coated glass slides.
The prey antibody (2 mg/ml mouse antihu-
man AFP monoclonal antibody with 30%
glycerol to prevent evaporation; Fapon
Biotech Company Inc., Shenzhen, China)
was spotted onto aldehyde-coated slides in
quadruplicate using a microarray spotter
(Cartesian Technologies, Irvine, CA, USA;
microarrays 4 Â 2 spots; spot size 700 mm;
spot-to-spot distance 1000 mm). Each well
contained four anti-AFP antibody and
four negative control (5% bovine serum
albumen [BSA]) spots. Following spotting,
the slides were incubated for 24 h at 4C to
fully immobilize proteins. Slides were then
blocked with 20 ml blocking buffer (10%
normal goat serum with 0.1% sodium azide)
for 2 h at 37C, washed four times
with 0.05% PBS-Tween 20 (pH 7.5) at
room temperature (5 s each wash), air
dried at room temperature and stored at
4C until use.

AFP quantification
Rabbit antimouse polyclonal antibody
(Abcam; Cambridge, UK) was labelled
with biotin using a biotin (type A) conjuga-
tion kit (Abcam), according to the manu-
facturer's instructions. Serum samples were
added to the microarray reaction wells,
hybridized for 30 min at 37C, then washed
four times with 0.05% PBS-Tween 20 (pH
7.5) at room temperature (5 s each wash).
The biotin-labelled rabbit antimouse poly-
clonal antibody (1 : 50 dilution) was added
to the wells and hybridized for 30 min at
37C. Slides were washed twice with 0.05%
PBS-Tween 20 (pH 7.5) at room tempera-
ture (5 s each wash), then incubated with
HRP-labelled streptavidin (1 : 50 dilution)
for 30 min at 37C. Slides were washed four
times with 0.05% PBS-Tween 20 (pH 7.5) at
room temperature (5 s each wash), then
incubated with chemiluminescent HRP sub-
strate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) for
5 s. Slides were scanned using a chemilumin-
escence imaging scanner (Academy of
Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China).
Levels of AFP in study samples were
quantified by reference to a standard curve,
established using serial AFP dilutions
(10 ng/ml, 5 ng/ml, 2.5 ng/ml and 1.25 ng/
ml) and 0.05% PBS-Tween 20 as negative
control (Figure 1). Reliability and stability
of the assay were verified by repeat quanti-
fication (10 assays) of the AFP standard
curve to calculate within-run and between-
run variation (Table 1). The cut-off value for
optimal diagnostic performance for serum
AFP quantification has been shown to
be 20 ng/ml (sensitivity 41­65%, specificity
80­94%).11,12 Therefore, the present study
used a cut-off value of 20 ng/ml.
ELISA
Serum AFP was quantified using ELISA
(AFP Human ELISA kit; Abcam), accord-
ing to the manufacturer's instructions.
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as meanÆ SD (coeffi-
cient of variation) or median (95% confidence
interval [CI]). Between-group comparisons of
AFP concentrations were made using Mann­
Whitney U-test for both protein microarray
and ELISA. Wilcoxon's rank sum test was
used to compare between-test differences in
AFP concentration. Spearman's correlation
coefficient was used to determine the associ-
ations between serum AFP concentrations as
determined by protein microarray or ELISA.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) ana-
lysis was performed to determine the diag-
nostic performance of protein microarray
and ELISA. Statistical analyses were con-
ducted using SPSSÕ version 17.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) for WindowsÕ. All tests
were two-tailed, and P-values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
The study included blood samples from 60
patients with HCC (39 male/21 female;
mean age 58.0 Æ 5.2 years; age range 48­67
years) and 30 healthy control subjects
(17 male/13 female; mean age 54.2 Æ 4.5
years; age range 46­64 years). There were
no significant between-group differences in
age or sex distribution.
Data regarding serum AFP concentra-
tions detected via ELISA and protein micro-
array are shown in Figure 2. Serum AFP
concentrations were significantly higher in
patients than in controls when quantified via
ELISA (2.86 ng/ml [95% CI2.33, 3.39 ng/ml]
versus 32.58 ng/ml [95% CI 29.28, 35.88 ng/
ml], P < 0.001) and protein microarray
(3.53 ng/ml [95% CI 3.09, 3.97 ng/ml]
versus 33.17 ng/ml [95% CI 29.99,
36.35 ng/ml], P < 0.001). There were no
significant between-test differences in AFP
concentrations in patients or controls. When
the cut-off value was set to 20 ng/ml, protein
microarray had 80% sensitivity and 100%

specificity for HCC diagnosis, and ELISA
had 83.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity
(Table 2).
There was a statistically significant
positive correlation between AFP concen-
trations quantified via ELISA and those
quantified via protein microarray (r ¼ 0.973,
P < 0.001; Figure 3). The ROC curve for
diagnosis of HCC is shown in Figure 4.
Serum AFP quantified via protein micro-
array had a similar diagnostic performance
to ELISA in distinguishing patients with

Discussion
Microarray technology is a powerful tool
for high throughput assays of protein
expression, protein­protein interaction
and enzyme activity.13,14 It has become an
effective diagnostic tool, since many disease-
related proteins are detectable in serum.15,16
The array is incubated with purified pro-
teins, serum or cell extract (``bait''); a

specificity for the diagnosis of HCC,
generating no false positives in healthy
control subjects. The sensitivity of diagnosis
via protein microarray was similar to that of
ELISA (the gold standard for AFP detec-
tion) in the present study. Protein micro-
array has several advantages over ELISA,
including rapidity, simplicity, and low cost.
The protein microarray was performed in
$1.5­2 h in the present study (excluding the
time taken to manufacture the microarray),
whereas the ELISA kit used in this experi-
ment required >3.5h. Protein microarray
assays are relatively simple to perform and
do not require highly skilled technicians.
In addition, the small size of the microarray
reduces the quantity of antibodies, antigens
and other materials required compared with
ELISA. The amounts of serum required for
the protein microarray are greatly reduced:
only 10 ml of original or diluted serum is
needed, whereas 50 ml of serum is needed for
ELISA. The quantities of antibodies for the
protein chip are also greatly reduced: only
0.25ml of mouse antihuman AFP monoclo-
nal antibody is needed for spotting on each
protein microarray, and 10ml of diluted
biotin-labelled rabbit antihuman AFP
polyclonal antibody is needed for detection.
Conversely,50ml of mouse antihuman AFP

monoclonal antibody and 50ml of diluted
biotin-labelled rabbit antihuman AFP poly-
clonal antibody are needed for ELISA.
There is room for improvement in protein
microarray technology. Detection with
fluorescent labelled antibodies provides a
great dynamic range for quantification and
signal amplification.20 Moreover, further
improving the uniformity of spots and
reducing background noise would allow
even more precise protein quantification.
Serum AFP has limited use as a single
biomarker for the early detection of HCC, as
it may not be sufficient to distinguish HCC
from chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis.21
Protein microarrays designed to detect mul-
tiple tumour markers would greatly increase
the utility of this technology for HCC
diagnosis.
In conclusion, protein microarray is a
potential alternative to ELISA for detecting
AFP in serum samples, in patients with
HCC. It is low cost, easy to perform, and
suitable for clinical diagnosis and public
health use.
