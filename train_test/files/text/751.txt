A Longitudinal Perspective On
Health Plan­Provider Risk
Contracting
Despite some broad national trends, the growth of risk arrangements
depends on local market circumstances, capacity, and interest.
by Robert Hurley, Joy Grossman, Timothy Lake, and Lawrence Casalino
ABSTRACT: During the past decade many health plans adopted risk-contracting arrange-
ments that transferred substantial financial risk and care management responsibility to
physician groups and hospital-sponsored integrated delivery systems. Risk transfer ar-
rangements are now believed to be in steep decline, but there is little empirical evidence on
this topic, particularly at the local-market level. Data from the Community Tracking Study
were used to examine changes in risk contracting from 1996 to 2000. A decline in reliance
on risk contracting is evident in nearly all markets. However, retrenchment in risk contract-
ing has followed different patterns ranging from refinements in the scope of risk transfer to
reduced use of risk arrangements to total rejection of risk-sharing arrangements. Modified
risk-transfer agreements remain viable in several markets, but continued refinement in the
nature and scope of risk sharing will be necessary.
In the mid-1990s it was expected that transfer of substantial financial
risk and care management responsibility from health plans to physician groups
and hospital-sponsored integrated delivery systems would become a dominant
arrangement in health maintenance organizations (HMOs).1 Risk contracts ap-
pealed to health plans seeking to curb medical expense growth and to physicians
and hospitals anxious to restore or preserve a measure of autonomy in care deliv-
ery.2 Although characterized as a "California model" by some, these arrangements
became a strategy of many health plans across the country.3
By the end of the decade some observers were contending that a "flight from
risk" had occurred.4 Loss of enthusiasm was attributed to poor utilization man-
agement, inadequate payments by health plans, and diminished savings opportu-
nities as further reductions in service use and cost became more difficult.5 In addi-

tion, a consumer and physician backlash engendered skepticism about health
plans' methods and motives. Plans became more cautious about the use of incen-
tives and increasingly offered broad-network, open-access (no gatekeeper) prod-
ucts that make it difficult to manage care and transfer risk.
Despite a belief that risk transfer is in steep decline, there is little empirical evi-
dence on this topic, particularly at the local-market level.6 We find important dif-
ferences in the trajectory of risk across markets, given the differing configurations
of physicians and health systems, diverse health plans, and varying past experi-
ence with risk arrangements. Changes in risk-based arrangements range from re-
fining the scope of services under risk in some markets to reductions in plan mem-
bership under risk transfer in others to full rejection of risk in still others.
Background
Although the desirability of risk arrangements has been long debated, there is a
general consensus that risk promotes cost-conscious provision of health services,
leading health plans to use risk extensively in HMO products.7 Health plans may
transfer financial risk to provider organizations for primary care services only
("primary care capitation") or include specialist physician services as well ("pro-
fessional risk"). Some risk arrangements also cover hospital and ancillary services
and pharmaceuticals (referred to as "shared risk" or "global risk"). We distinguish
between global and shared risk based on whether the contracting organization ac-
cepts full risk for inpatient care or the risk is shared between the health plan and
the physician groups or physician-hospital organization (PHO).
From a provider perspective, a distinction in risk transfer is sometimes made
between "business risk" and "insurance risk."8 Business risk is risk for services
over which the provider organization can reasonably be expected to exert at least
a moderate degree of control, such as physician, ancillary, or hospital services. In-
surance risk includes services over which providers have little or no control, as in
the case of pharmaceutical costs, new benefit mandates imposed during a contract
period, or out-of-network service use by plan members.
Some health plans have promoted or permitted risk contracting because they
believe that the "delegated model" is important as a means to change the behavior
of physicians and hospitals. It may also enable plans to limit their medical expense
exposure by shifting financial risk for care, to reduce their administrative costs of
managing care, and to lessen friction with providers who have chafed under
micromanaged care. Physicians and hospitals have viewed assumption of risk as a
way to reduce external interference in clinical decision making and to reap the
gains of cost reductions that changes in their practices may yield. In addition,
since capitation payments are not tied to generating procedures and office visits,
physician and hospital organizations can use the budget capitation provides to
promote preferred practice behavior and to achieve organizational goals.
Efforts by physicians and hospitals to create new organizations came into

vogue in the early 1990s and included integrated delivery systems (IDSs), inde-
pendent practice associations (IPAs), PHOs, and physician practice management
(PPM) firms, as well as the extensive purchase of physician practices by hospi-
tals.9 Many saw risk contracts as an important complement to other contributing
factors, a kind of physiological change to shape and sustain the anatomical
changes represented by these new organizations. Despite these broad national de-
velopments, the growth of risk arrangements remained highly dependent on local
market circumstances, capacity, and interest.10
Study Methods
The Community Tracking Study (CTS) is a multiyear, multimethod project of
the Center for Studying Health System Change (HSC) to analyze patterns of
change in a representative sample of sixty markets.11 Twelve metropolitan markets
with populations over 200,000 were randomly selected for in-depth study, with
intensive site visits conducted in 1996, 1998, and 2000. The site visits include pro-
tocol-driven telephone and in-person interviews with fifty to ninety informants in
each site representing purchasing, health plan, policy, physician, and hospital sec-
tors. A total of 2,220 interviews have been conducted across the twelve sites dur-
ing the three rounds. In addition, every two years HSC surveys households (with a
follow-back survey to explore type of insurance questions) and physicians in the
sixty markets. We use results from the 1996­97 CTS Followback Survey to bench-
mark risk contracting at that point in time.
Data for this study are drawn primarily from 210 interviews conducted be-
tween June 2000 and March 2001 with executives from three to six health plans in
each market--a total of forty-one plans. Selected plans include market leaders
among regional and national plans, and local Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans. In addi-
tion, 256 administrative and clinical leaders in the major health systems and physi-
cian organizations were interviewed in the twelve markets. Respondents were
asked about contracting arrangements, experience with various configurations of
risk transfer, and changes made in network arrangements. All interview notes
were incorporated into qualitative data analysis software for coding and analysis.
Study Results
Data from the 1996­97 survey and interview results from Round 1 site visits
were used to sort the twelve markets into three broad clusters based on the
amount (number of covered lives) and scope (services incorporated under risk
payments) of risk contracting (Exhibit 1). In this study we focus on professional
and global or shared risk contracts. Orange County in Southern California, where
shared risk arrangements have been the dominant form for HMO networks for a
number of years, is the only market placed in the extensive-risk cluster. At the
other extreme, with limited risk, are Little Rock, Lansing, Greenville, and North-
ern New Jersey, where risk transfer was typically used by a single plan with a sin-

gle medical group or IPA.
The moderate-risk cluster of markets is more heterogeneous, with the amount
and types of risk arrangements being quite varied. In these markets risk contract-
ing was receiving considerable attention from a number of plans and providers in
1996 but was not yet in widespread use. In Miami and Cleveland, for example, risk
arrangements were most commonly found in a single product line such as
Medicare or Medicaid. In Boston large hospital-based systems formed in the
mid-1990s contracted with some health plans to share risk among plans, systems,
and affiliated physicians. In Indianapolis the largest HMO product was offered by
a network-based health plan having global risk contracts with nearly twenty dif-
ferent provider organizations. Syracuse had a similar but smaller-scale network
plan that limited the scope of risk transferred.
Our findings examine plan-to-provider risk transfer, and thus our market char-
acterizations are based on how sampled plans employed risk arrangements across
the twelve markets. It also is apparent that provider organizations in these mar-
kets fall into three broad categories. Some groups were accepting extensive
(global or shared) risk across most contracts in 1996; other groups took less risk,

by virtue of fewer contracts or more limited scope in their contracts; and still
other groups had limited risk experience, meaning few contracts and typically
only professional risk. While our focus in this paper is on plan-to-provider con-
tracting, we also note changes that occurred among provider groups.
n 1996 interviews. Round 1 interviewees in all markets expected both HMO
enrollment and risk contracting to grow rapidly in commercial and Medicare lines
of business. This was particularly true in metropolitan markets such as Indianapolis
and Northern New Jersey, where HMO enrollment had lagged behind national
trends or where the Medicare HMO market was seen as a growth opportunity for
plans, as in Boston and Cleveland. Expectations of growing reliance on HMO reve-
nues led physicians and health systems to position themselves to "move up the food
chain," which meant both seeking risk transfer contracts and expanding care deliv-
ery capacity through acquisitions or strategic affiliations and alliances.
Medical groups and IPAs in Orange County were already deeply involved in
shared risk arrangements with plans that included pharmacy and other ancillary
services. In other markets with less experience with risk arrangements, hospital
systems and physician organizations were being created as necessary transitional
steps to enter into global and shared risk contracts. A notable example was the
formation in Boston of two large integrated systems, Partners and CareGroup.
PHOs and IPAs emerged in other markets in this period, with hospitals playing an
integral role in the former and physicians usually providing the leadership in the
latter. PHOs enabled hospitals and their affiliated physicians to enter into global
or shared risk arrangements as IDSs. Freestanding IPAs and medical groups typi-
cally limited contract scope to professional or shared risk. Phoenix, Seattle, Cleve-
land, Indianapolis, and Syracuse saw substantial development of such models.
Small, embryonic IPAs also arose in some of the markets in the limited-risk cluster.
The viability of risk-transfer arrangements in the moderate- and limited-risk
market clusters hinged on plans' willingness to enter into contracts with newly
organized and unproven entities. Some health plans encouraged their growth,
while others were skeptical about these entities' capacity to perform risk-bearing
roles. There was especially strong support for risk-bearing entities in the
Medicare HMO product, since risk arrangements--typically global or "percent-
age of premium" contracts--were seen as key in encouraging physicians to reduce
the large inpatient expenses of Medicare and to share in the savings that resulted.
Plans with well-established networks with individual physician and hospital con-
tracts already in place, such as Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, were less enthusiastic
about risk arrangements.
n 1998 interviews. The Round 2 interviews found that efforts to promote risk
transfer set in motion in Round 1 had paid off in several markets. But many provider
organizations found it more difficult than expected to profit from risk contracting,
and some suffered heavy losses. Insurance premiums had risen little between
Rounds 1 and 2. Correspondingly, capitation payments were flat and lagging behind

increases in costs, especially as prescription drug costs began to rise, adversely af-
fecting those organizations that were at risk for these services.
Reductions in service use had been expected to provide savings that would ac-
crue to risk-contracting physicians and hospitals. But in some markets reductions
in use had already been made, making further savings difficult. In other markets
where such reductions had not yet been made, plans and providers found it diffi-
cult to institute effective utilization management. Meanwhile, a consumer back-
lash challenged managed care techniques, including capitation and utilization
management. Health plans began to modify products and practices, shifting em-
phasis away from HMOs and traditional risk arrangements toward point-of-
service (POS) and preferred provider organization (PPO) products.12
Orange County witnessed the collapse of major PPM firms that had tried to ag-
gregate market clout by purchasing medical groups and managing IPAs.13 Al-
though the failures had many causes, interviewees in several markets saw them as
a direct challenge to the soundness of the "California model" of risk transfer.
These failures and similar but smaller-scale failures of risk-bearing physician orga-
nizations in northern New Jersey and Phoenix provoked regulatory attention in
all three states, raising doubts about and, in some cases, barriers to risk contracting.
In markets with moderate or limited risk-transfer experience, caution became
the watchword. Plans with interest in risk contracts found fewer organizations
willing and able to assume and manage risk, especially risk for services over which
providers could not exert much control. In midsize and small markets such as In-
dianapolis, Lansing, Greenville, Little Rock, and Syracuse, the role of dominant lo-
cal hospital systems was typically a determinant. Some systems had originally em-
braced risk as a way to lock in specialty and hospital referral relationships through
PHOs that accepted global capitation, such as in Indianapolis. But many health
systems lost money on their risk contracts, and, over time, most failed to receive
enough patients through risk contracts to effect changes in behavior or to justify
major investment in management systems and infrastructure. Enthusiasm faded
for initiatives that did not grow revenue and consumed resources. Many systems
also found that integration efforts between physicians and hospitals were not pro-
gressing, and distribution of risk payments among primary care physicians, spe-
cialists, and hospitals became a troublesome management issue.
n 2000 interviews. Round 3 interviews revealed several notable developments
since 1998 with important implications for risk transfer. Plans had begun to obtain
sizable premium increases from purchasers, and providers expected to receive cor-
responding increases in capitation payments. Financial distress, attributed in part
to the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997, also led many physicians and hospitals to
demand higher payments from health plans and threaten to refuse to continue to
participate in networks unless their demands were met.14 Already facing serious dis-
content among consumers and employers, health plans acceded to these demands in
order to keep networks intact in many instances.

Hospitals also began to refuse to accept risk-based payments, putting global
capitation arrangements in jeopardy and making shared risk arrangements less
practical. As one hospital executive stated, "We have a basic belief that we don't
belong in and don't want to be in the insurance business." Physicians also chal-
lenged the scope of their risk contracts because of their discomfort with the
amount of insurance risk they had assumed. This pushing back led many plans to
agree to exclude from risk contracts pharmaceuticals and benefit and service
mandates that providers contended they could not be expected to influence, par-
ticularly when mandates were implemented after contracts were already in place.
Change in risk-contracting practices between 1998 and 2000 in the forty-one
health plans interviewed in Round 3 falls into several patterns (Exhibit 2). While
overall only three fewer plans engaged in risk transfer in 2000 (23) than in 1998
(26), the scope of risk transferred was reduced, and plans became more discrimi-
nating in selecting risk-contracting partners. Despite turmoil in Orange County
related to PPM failures and the refusal of some hospitals to continue risk arrange-
ments, all major health plans there remain committed to the "delegated model."
But the price of sustaining this commitment has been large payment increases to
shore up contracting medical groups, IPAs, and hospitals. In addition, in five of the
six plans there has been refinement in the scope of contracting, including taking
back some pharmacy risk and reducing the impact on risk-bearing entities of state
regulations such as mental health parity and mandated immunizations, elements
of "insurance risk" that providers consider unacceptable.
In the cluster of markets with limited risk-transfer experience, very few physi-
cians, hospitals, or health plans were ever enthusiastic about risk contracting, and

it was used in only three of the fifteen plans. One plan discontinued all risk, and
the remaining two have fewer risk contracts and fewer lives under these contracts.
PHOs and IPAs have been dismantled or have become inactive. HMO product
growth has also stalled or is in decline, with nonrisk PPOs the product of choice.
Notably, the dominant insurer in each market is a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan that
had made minimal investment in HMO products and risk contracting.
The markets in the moderate-risk cluster reveal a mixed picture. Between 1998
and 2000 only two of the twenty-three plans interviewed had dropped all risk-
transfer contracts, but other forms of retrenchment were evident. Five plans had
reduced the scope of risk delegated, and eight plans reduced the number of mem-
bers covered by risk contracts by contracting with fewer risk-bearing provider or-
ganizations. Seattle typifies this pattern: Plans found fewer organizations willing
to accept risk contracts, resulting in fewer plan members under risk arrangements.
Risk arrangements remained in place for some members because plans were
willing to undertake major changes to salvage them, including increased pay-
ments or carving out of pharmacy and other risk from contracts. In other cases, as
in Cleveland and Miami, risk-transfer agreements remain principally in use in the
Medicare market, although they could be in future jeopardy because of Medicare+
Choice policy changes. In Boston, where risk transfer has been in moderate use,
plans have had to relent to pressures for large payment increases for health sys-
tems that are still reassessing their posture toward risk. One executive character-
ized the change as "a more thoughtful approach to risk, as opposed to the huge
stampede toward risk five years ago." In Indianapolis and Syracuse a single health
plan continues to rely on risk contracts. However, in all of the markets in this cate-
gory, some physician organizations or health systems have achieved enough suc-
cess in risk contracting to retain support for these agreements, even as other plans
and providers eschew them.
Discussion
This longitudinal perspective on twelve randomly selected metropolitan areas
provides valuable insights into the extent of risk contracting and how it has
evolved as experience has accumulated and broader market conditions have
changed. A number of patterns are apparent, including both sizable rate increases
and retrenchment. Retrenchment is occurring in two forms: (1) reduction in the
scope of services for which providers will accept risk to something closer to busi-
ness risk; and (2) reduction in plan members covered under risk because fewer
provider organizations are willing to participate in risk contracts.
In Orange County, with established medical groups and integrated systems
that embraced risk transfer, risk arrangements remain in place, but their scope has
been refined to exclude some services providers believe they cannot control, and
payment rates have been increased. For markets where risk transfer has been em-
ployed more tentatively, such as Seattle, Indianapolis, and Cleveland, the picture

is one of a broader retreat in terms of both narrowing the scope of risk arrange-
ments and reducing the number of HMO members covered under risk-transfer ar-
rangements. Substantial capitation rate increases have also been reported in these
markets. In the markets with limited risk-transfer experience, risk rejection is evi-
dent, with few if any risk-transfer arrangements likely to survive.
The success of risk transfer in a local market hinges on several factors: (1) plans'
competence in selecting suitable risk-contracting partners; (2) presence of pro-
vider organizations willing and able to manage risk; (3) ability of plans and pro-
viders to agree on the appropriate scope of services for which risk can be trans-
ferred; and (4) adequacy of capitation payments to providers. Lack of growth in
risk-transfer arrangements appears to reflect the fact that few new provider orga-
nizations have developed an interest in taking on the risk and responsibilities
these arrangements entail, or the capacity to do so. For plans and their risk part-
ners that have stepped back from these arrangements, risk transfer is unlikely to
reemerge in the near term as an important strategy.
It is clear that plan payment rates have to meet provider expenses over time to
sustain risk transfer arrangements, but that has not been the case in many in-
stances for a number of reasons. Some providers have been overly optimistic about
their ability to manage care. Others may have been naïve in rate negotiation and
actuarial estimation. Still others accepted risk for costs they could not be ex-
pected to control, or they encountered unexpectedly large cost increases. In other
situations, plans may have used the threat of exclusion from their networks to gain
providers' acceptance of what proved to be inadequate rates, or refused to include
realistic updates to reflect changing conditions.
Our evidence cannot address fundamental questions of whether
transfer of risk provides a better mechanism for generating and sustaining
cost savings by devolving more control to physicians, or how risk contract-
ing, and the provider reorganization that it requires, affects the quality of care.15 It
is possible that savings and financial success achieved in some cases by risk-
bearing providers resulted because of more effective care management, especially
of inpatient services. Alternatively, some apparent success could have been an arti-
fact of timing relative to the health insurance underwriting cycle. More research is
needed to assess the impact of risk transfer on cost savings and quality.
Where risk contracting is well entrenched, there appears to be a reasonably
high comfort level between plans and physician organizations with the division of
responsibility and the amount of autonomy for patient care that it affords physi-
cians. Despite the tumultuous experience of the past few years in Orange County,
few observers there are predicting a radical change in reliance on risk transfer.16
Seattle, Boston, Cleveland, and Indianapolis also continue to have risk-contract-
ing relationships between health plans and provider organizations, although their
futures are less certain. Given that the search for a modicum of peaceful coexis-
