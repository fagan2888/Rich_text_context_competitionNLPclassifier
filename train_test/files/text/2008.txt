Abstract
Recent survey data reveal persistent race/ethnic disparities in prevalence of adiposity in U.S. children and adolescents. We
examined race/ethnic differentials in time trends in dietary behaviors of Americans 2­19 y of age to understand if these
trends track those observed for body weight. We used dietary data from the NHANES 1988­1994, 1999­2002, and 2003­
2008 (n = 24,131) to examine changes in reported energy intake, amount of foods and beverages, number of eating
occasions, and percent of energy from foods and beverages, among non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican
American 2­19 y olds. Multivariable regression analyses appropriate for complex surveys were used to examine these
associations. The secular increase in mean number of eating occasions was significant (P-trend , 0.0001) in all age and
race/ethnic groups; however, a corresponding increase in the amount of foods and beverages, or total energy intake was
not observed. In non-Hispanic black and Mexican American 2­5 and 12­19 y olds, the secular increase in number of eating
occasions, and in non-Hispanic black 12­19 y olds, the increase in percent of energy from all beverages or non-nutritive
beverages were greater relative to non-Hispanic whites. In conclusion, the observed race/ethnic differences in trajectory
of changes in dietary behaviors over past 20 y were modest and were not accompanied by a significant increase in energy
intake. Cautious interpretation is urged due to potential underreporting of dietary intake in national surveys. There was a
suggestion of convergence in some race/ethnic differentials in dietary behaviors due to greater relative changes in possibly
adverse behaviors in non-Hispanic blacks, especially adolescents. J. Nutr. 141: 1880­1888, 2011.
Introduction
Considerable race/ethnic disparities in prevalence of adiposity
in U.S. children and adolescents have been recognized (1­3). In
the 20-y period from 1971­1974 to 1988­1994, the prevalence
of obesity increased in children from all race/ethnic groups;
however, the percentage increase was greater for non-Hispanic
black and Mexican American children and adolescents (2,3). In
a recent assessment of change in prevalence of obesity from
1988­1994 to 2007­2008, the increase in prevalence of obesity
among Mexican American and non-Hispanic black adolescents
12­19 y of age far exceeded that observed in non-Hispanic white
adolescents (1). Higher adiposity in children is a predictor of a
variety of adverse health outcomes (4­6); in minority children,
childhood and adolescent body weight track with adult body
weight to a greater extent than in non-Hispanic white children
(7).
Complex interactions of biological and environmental fac-
tors, including diet, determine energy balance and contribute to
ethnic differentials in body weight (8). Ethnic differences in
dietary patterns reflect a confluence of cultural beliefs and food
practices modified by the social, economic, and environmental
contexts of food desirability, affordability, and availability (9).
Kumanyika (9) has argued that a study of dietary behaviors of
different ethnic groups not only helps in identifying behaviors as-
sociated with higher body weight in the high-risk ethnic groups
but also provides information about which behaviors may have
causal associations with body weight for the population as a
whole. Assessment of time trends in possible ethnic differentials
in dietary behaviors also sheds light on whether the changing
food norms, availability, and marketplace have a differential
impact on different ethnic groups. Such knowledge is necessary
for the identification, design, and targeting of suitable interven-
tions to achieve the goal of elimination of health disparities that
are part of the national health promotion agenda.
Several prior studies have made important contributions to
our understanding of changing dietary profiles of American children
(10­37). However, most studies using nationally representative data

have not examined recent trends, most have not examined if
there are race/ethnic differentials in observed trends, and many
did not adjust for changes in distribution of socio-demographic
and dietary collection variables across surveys (10­24). Other
studies mentioned above have examined selected age groups
(25­37). A comprehensive picture of dietary and meal attributes
is important to appreciate whether the observed dietary changes
track with other possible compensatory or complementary die-
tary and meal behaviors, yet few of the previous studies provide
this information.
Therefore, to understand the possible contribution of dietary
behaviors to different race/ethnic trajectories of weight gain,
we examined race/ethnic differences in 20-y time trends (from
1988­1994 to 2007­2008) in dietary and meal characteristics of
Americans children and adolescents using multivariable methods
to adjust for family income and education.
Methods
To answer the above question, we analyzed public domain data from the
NHANES conducted from 1988­1994, 1999­2000, 2001­2002, 2003­
2004, 2005­2006, and 2007­2008 (38). This study was approved by the
Queens College institutional review board for protection of human
participants with an exempt review. The NHANES is conducted by the
NCHS and consists of a nationally representative, stratified, multistage,
probability sample of the U.S. population. The NHANES III (1988­
1994) was a multi-year survey; beginning with 1999, the NHANES
became a continuous annual survey and data are released for 2 combined
years at a time. Each survey included a home interview of the sample
person and an examination in the MEC6. The examination components
included a complete physical exam, anthropometry, and a dietary inter-
view. The unweighted response rates for the MEC examined sample of
all ages combined for NHANES III (1988­1994), 1999­2000, 2001­
2002, 2003­2004, 2005­2006, and 2007­2008 were 78, 76, 80, 76, 77,
and 75%, respectively (38). The response rates for the ages examined
in the current analysis (2­19 y) were generally higher than the rates
mentioned above. The NHANES III oversampled 2­5 y olds and black
and Mexican American populations; surveys conducted from 1999 to
2006 oversampled low-income persons, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican
Americans, and 12­19 y olds (38). The surveys conducted prior to 1988
did not include a large enough sample of Mexican Americans as an
ethnic group to provide reliable estimates; therefore, these surveys were
not included in the present analysis.
Race/ethnicity information in each survey
Respondents to each survey self-reported race/ethnicity; for public
domain release, the NCHS provides variables that combine race and
ethnicity by adjudicating the available information. The public release
data for 1999­2008 provide non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Mexican American, and other race/ethnic categories. The other category
includes Hispanics who were not Mexican Americans and all other
ethnic groups. The present analyses included non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, and Mexican American race/ethnic groups.
Dietary information
The NHANES III and the NHANES 1999­2008 collected dietary
information using an interviewer-administered, computer-assisted, 24-h
dietary recall interview. For children 2­5 y of age, the recall was provided
by parents or other caregivers; recalls of 6­11 y olds were self-reported
with assistance from parents or other caregivers; and 12­19 y olds self-
reported their intake (38). In the NHANES III, the dietary recall was
collected using a 3-step procedure that changed to a 4-step process in
1999­2001 and finally to the 5-step AMPM beginning with the 2002
survey year. In 2002, the NHANES was integrated with the USDA food
consumption surveys as part of "What We Eat in America" protocol
(38,39) and all subsequent surveys (2003­2008) used the same methods.
The NHANES III and publicly available dietary data for the NHANES
1999­2002 included 1 recall; 2 recalls (one via telephone) were collected
in the NHANES 2003­2008. The analyses reported in the present study
used the first recall for all surveys. The NHANES III survey used the
USDA's Survey Nutrient Database (40) and surveys from 1999­2008
used the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (ver-
sions 1­4.1) (41) to code and estimate the nutrient content of foods and
beverages reported in these surveys.
Analytic sample
For each survey, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican
American children and adolescents 2­19 y of age with a dietary recall
considered by the NCHS to be complete and acceptable (38) were
eligible for inclusion in the analytic sample for this study (NHANES III,
n = 9871; NHANES 1999­2002, n = 7382; NHANES 2003­2008, n =
9749). From this eligible sample, we excluded pregnant and lactating
females (NHANES III, n = 52; NHANES 1999­2002, n = 85; NHANES
2003­2006, n = 107) and those missing information on family income
and education level of head of household (NHANES III, n = 918;
NHANES 1999­2002, n = 728; NHANES 2003­2008, n = 779). The
2007­2008 survey years included up to 17 12­19 y olds whose
pregnancy and lactation information was not available in the public
domain data. One respondent in each survey (NHANES III, 1999­2002
and 2003­2008) reported no energy intake (zero calorie) and was
excluded from the analytic sample. The final analytic sample size was:
NHANES III, 8900; NHANES 1999­2002, 6369; and NHANES 2003­
2008, 8862.
Dietary and meal intake variables
To obtain a comprehensive picture of dietary profiles, we examined 3
types of dietary variables in this study: diet quantity and composition,
food form, and meal patterns. The decision to examine these variables
was based on the current speculation in the literature about the possible
roles of food portions, energy density, sweetened beverages, and
snacking as contributors to increasing body weights of U.S. children
(8,9). Therefore, in our presentation and narrative of results and their
interpretation, we considered energy intake, amount (grams) of foods
and beverages, percent energy from beverages, and number of eating
occasions as "key dietary outcomes" and all other dietary attributes as
"secondary dietary outcomes."
Diet quantity and composition. These included total energy, percent-
age of energy from macronutrients, dietary fiber, amount (g) of all
reported foods and beverages, and energy density (energy content/g) of
all foods and beverages and of foods only.
Food form. To examine hypotheses related to the association of food
form (liquid vs. solid), we created variables that identified all beverages
and nonbeverage foods in the recall. Using previously reported methods,
all types of liquid milk, 100% juices, juice drinks, shakes, infant formula,
carbonated beverages, coffee and tea, and alcohol, etc. were considered
as beverages (42). Plain tap or bottled water (unsweetened) was not
considered a beverage for this purpose. From this group, juice drinks,
carbonated or noncarbonated beverages, coffee or tea, and alcohol were
considered non-nutritive beverages. The variables created examined the
total amount (g) and the percent of 24-h energy intake from foods and
beverages.
Meal intake. The number of eating occasions was determined from
number of discrete clock times any food, beverage, or their combinations
were reported in the dietary recall. All foods or beverages reported at one
clock time (e.g. as part of a meal) were considered one eating occasion.
We have used these methods in our previous examination of trends in
adults (43). Eating occasions when the only reported item was plain
water or unsweetened bottled water were not counted as eating occasions.
In the recall, respondents were asked to name each eating occasion. Using
previously published methods, occasions named as breakfast, desayuno,

or almuerzo were considered breakfast (44). Eating occasions named as
snack, drink, other, or equivalents in Spanish were considered a snack
(43). Eating occasions not named as snack or other were considered main
meals and included breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, supper, or equiv-
alents in Spanish. The percent of 24-h energy intake from main meals,
snacks/other, and that reported at or after 1700 h was computed for each
respondent (43).
Because of reports of the occurrence of low-energy reporting in
national surveys, we also compared the ratio of reported EI:BEE. The
BEE was computed using age-sex-BMI-for-sex-age percentile specific
equations developed by the committee on Dietary Reference Intakes
(45). We considered an EI:BEE ratio of ,0.92 to indicate low energy
reporting. Because new recommended methods for the determination of
implausible dietary reports could not be implemented for all surveys
included in our analyses (46), the cutoff used was based on methods de-
scribed by Goldberg et al. (47) and has been used by other investigators
(48).
Statistical analyses
NCHS recommends combining data from the recent 2-y NHANES
cycles to provide more reliable estimates for subgroup analyses (49).
Therefore, we combined 1999­2000 with 2001­2002, and 2003­2004
and 2005­2006 with 2007­2008. Thus, the trend analyses included
combined data from the 6 y of the NHANES III (1988­1994), 4 y of
NHANES 1999­2002, and 6 y of NHANES 2003­2008.
The age range from 2 to 19 y includes a wide range of developmental
stages, varying degree of family, social, and environmental influences, the
extent of autonomy in food selection, and age differences in prevalence
of adiposity. Therefore, our analyses were stratified by the age categories
of 2­5, 6­11, and 12­19 y. These age categories are consistent with
the age categories used for reporting of NHANES body weight data by
the NCHS (1) and also reflect the age differences in respondents for the
dietary recall.
We used multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses for
continuous and dichotomous dependent variables, respectively, to ex-
amine the independent association of each dietary attribute with race-
ethnicity across surveys in analyses stratified by age group (2­5, 6­11,
and 12­19 y). These analyses included each dietary/meal characteristic
as a continuous or dichotomous outcome and the covariates potentially
related to race/ethnicity and diet as independent variables. Because race/
ethnic group membership in the US is correlated with family income and
level of education (50), all regression analyses included variables for
family income as PIR and education level of head of household. Other
covariates that are possibly differentially distributed among surveys and
race/ethnic groups included day of week of dietary intake, season of
MEC exam, country of birth of household reference person, household
size, and BMI for gender-age percentile based on 2000 CDC growth
charts (51). The multiple regression models thus included dummy
variables for race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black,
and Mexican American), the covariates (mentioned above), and varia-
bles indicating survey(s) (NHANES 1988­1994, 1999­2002, and 2003­
2008) as independent variables. In this analysis, the combined surveys
(1988­1994, 1999­2002, and 2003­2008) were included together as
independent samples representing the U.S. population corresponding to
the time period of each survey. We tested whether the trends in dietary
characteristics across surveys among race/ethnic groups were similar by
testing the interaction of race/ethnicity and survey using models in which
survey was either categorical or as a scored variable for survey year,
where the midpoint of the time span of the survey is the score.
To enable interpretation of race/ethnic and survey effects when
significant race/ethnicity by survey interactions were not present, we
tested the main effects of race/ethnicity and survey using the above
regression models without the race/ethnicity by survey interaction term.
For uniformity and descriptive purposes, we provided estimates of the
adjusted means and proportions of dietary outcomes for each race and
survey combination (obtained from models that included a race by
survey interaction term) and main effects of race/ethnicity and survey
(obtained from models without the interaction term), adjusted for other
covariates in the multivariable regression (52,53). For energy intake, we
reanalyzed the regression models after excluding respondents with a
low EI:BEE ratio. Wald F tests were used for all statistical tests, with level
of significance set at P # 0.05 (53). The reported P values for tests of
significance are not adjusted for multiple comparisons; this criterion of
significance is used as a guide to identify dietary relationships of potential
interest. Multiple comparisons increase the probability of finding signif-
icant associations; therefore, the reported P values should be interpreted
with caution.
We followed NCHS recommendations for sample weights applicable
to analyses from combined surveys (49). This weighting produced esti-
mates that represented the population included in each individual survey.
These analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.2 (RTI) and SAS-
callable SUDAAN (54) to adjust for the complex, stratified sample design
of the NHANES (53).
Results
Characteristics of the population. Relative to the other 2
race/ethnic groups, a slightly higher proportion of Mexican
Americans were 2­5 y of age and a slightly lower proportion
were 12­19 y of age (Table 1). Over 30% of non-Hispanic black
and .50% of Mexican American household head or reference
persons had ,12 y of education and ;40% had a family PIR ,1
in all surveys. Over 50% of Mexican American household
reference persons were born in countries other than the US.
The following narrative of results related to the study
question is divided into 2 parts. The first part is focused on
key dietary outcomes of energy intake, amount (g) of foods and
beverages, percent of 24-h energy from beverages, and number
of eating occasions for 2­5, 6­11, and 12­19 y olds, respectively
(Fig. 1­3; Supplemental Tables 1­3). The second part summa-
rizes findings about secondary dietary outcomes of percent of
24-h energy from macronutrients; fiber (g); amount of foods;
amount of beverages; percent of 24-h energy from foods and
nonnutritive beverages; energy density of foods; mention of
breakfast; mention of a snack; percent of 24-h energy from main
meals or snacks and at or after 1700 h (Supplemental Tables 4­
6). For all dietary outcomes, first we described the results of race
by survey interactions; for dietary outcomes without significant
race by survey interaction, we presented the main effect of race/
ethnicity across all surveys combined (Supplemental Tables 1­6).
For context, we provided information on BMI in Figures 1­3 and
Supplemental Tables 3­6.
Time trends in self-reported dietary outcomes
Did the association of race/ethnicity with key dietary out-
comes (energy intake, amount of foods and beverages,
percent of 24-h energy from beverages, and number of
eating occasions) change from 1988­1994 to 2003­08? In
all age groups, the interaction of race/ethnicity and survey was
not significant for total energy intake, the amount (g) of foods
and beverages, and percent of 24-h energy from beverages
(except in 12­19 y olds) (Fig. 1­3; Supplemental Tables 1­3).
Although the reported number of eating occasions increased over
time in all race/ethnic groups, the secular increase in non-Hispanic
black and Mexican American 2­5 and 12­19 y olds was higher
relative to non-Hispanic whites (P for race by survey interaction
# 0.02). A similar trend was also noted for percent energy from
beverages in 12­19 y old non-Hispanic blacks.
Was there a main effect of race/ethnicity for key dietary
outcomes? In all age groups, the race/ethnic differences in
mean energy intakes were not significant; however, the mean
amounts of foods and beverages differed among race/ethnic
groups, with non-Hispanic whites reporting the highest and the
non-Hispanic blacks reporting the lowest amounts (marginals in
1882 Kant and Graubard

Downloaded from
Supplemental Tables 1­3). The mean percent of 24-h energy
intake from beverages also differed among race/ethnic groups
for 2­5 and 6­11 y olds, with non-Hispanic blacks reporting the
lowest percentage (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2).
Did the association of race/ethnicity with secondary
dietary outcomes [percent of 24-h energy from macronu-
trients; fiber (g); amount of foods; amount of beverages;
percent of 24-h energy from foods and nonnutritive
beverages; energy density of foods; mention of breakfast;
mention of a snack; percent of 24-h energy from main
meals or snacks and at or after 1700 h] change from 1988­
1994 to 2003­2008? In children 2­5 y of age, the decline in
dietary fiber intake (also noted in 6­11 y olds) and the reported
amount of foods (only) was greater in non-Hispanic blacks
relative to other race/ethnic groups (Supplemental Tables 4­5).
Among adolescents 12­19 y of age, the interactions of race and
survey were significant for several dietary outcomes [percent of
energy from fat and carbohydrate, percent of 24-h energy intake
from foods (only) and nonnutritive beverages, percent reporting
breakfast, and percent of energy reported at or after 1700 h]
(Supplemental Table 6). The decline in percent of energy from
fat and foods (only) and increase in percent energy from
carbohydrate and nonnutritive beverages was larger and signif-
icant in non-Hispanic blacks relative to non-Hispanic whites.
Was there a main effect of race/ethnicity for secondary
dietary outcomes? With a few exceptions, significant race/
ethnic differences for a majority of the secondary dietary out-
comes were observed at all ages (marginals in Supplemental
Tables 3­6). Non-Hispanic black 2­5 and 6­11 y olds were less
likely to mention a snack in the recall and reported lower mean
number of snacks relative to non-Hispanic whites (Supplemental
Tables 4 and 5).

The secular changes in percent of 2­5 y olds with gender-age-
specific BMI percentile of $85 and in 12­19 y olds, the mean
BMI, differed among race/ethnic groups (Supplemental Tables
4­6). The race/ethnicity differences (main effect) in percent with
$85th BMI percentile or mean BMI were significant (marginals
in Supplemental Tables 4­6).
In regression analyses that excluded respondents with a low
EI:BEE ratio, the adjusted mean energy intakes were expectedly
higher, but race/ethnic differentials and trends were similar to
estimates without exclusions (Supplemental Table 7). Similar
results were observed for amounts of foods and beverages,
percent of 24-h energy from beverages, and energy density of
foods (data not shown).
Discussion
The most popular dietary hypotheses for explaining increasing
adiposity of American children and adolescents are secular
increases in portion sizes, number of eating occasions, sweetened
beverage consumption, and energy density of foods (8,9). The
only hypothesis unequivocally supported by the present study is
that of a secular increase in the number of eating occasions in
children and adolescents of all race/ethnic backgrounds. How-
ever, the relative importance of this observation is open to debate
given that the increase in eating occasions was not accompanied
by the expected secular increase in energy intake and amount of
foods and beverages (expected because of possible increases in
portion sizes). To our knowledge, few other studies have
examined race/ethnic diet trends over the time period examined
in this study to make informed comparisons.
The observed secular changes in dietary behaviors were small
and their direction was generally similar in all race/ethnic
groups. However, there is a suggestion of a somewhat larger
change in some dietary behaviors among 2­5 and 12­19 y old
non-Hispanic blacks. For example, in 1988­1994, non-Hispanic
whites of all ages reported the highest number of eating
occasions; however, in minority 2­5 and 12­19 y olds, the
incline was steeper, leading to convergence and narrowing of the
ethnic differential by 2003­2008. In 1988­1994, the race
differences in breakfast reporting by 12­19 y olds were not
significant but became significant in 2003­2008 because of a
decline in the percent of non-Hispanic blacks and an increase in
the percent of Mexican Americans who reported breakfast.
Non-Hispanic black and Mexican American adolescents in-
creased their intake of energy from carbohydrate and decreased
their energy intake from fat so that race differences in these
behaviors were present in 1988­1994 but not in later surveys.
However, in these adolescents, given the larger decline in dietary
fiber over time and the significant secular increase in percent
energy from all beverages or nonnutritive beverages (in non-
Hispanic black adolescents), the higher percent of carbohydrate
energy does not indicate improved dietary selections. These
results collectively suggest that relative changes in adoption of
possibly adverse dietary behaviors affected non-Hispanic black
adolescents to a greater extent. Overall, therefore, the apparent
convergence of trends in many dietary attributes appeared to be
not due to greater improvement of behavior in non-Hispanic
blacks but due to greater worsening of dietary behaviors.
Despite widely held beliefs about large increases in beverage
consumption in the U.S. population, the relative mean contri-

bution of energy from all beverages, nonnutritive beverages, and
foods changed little across surveys. At all ages, there were
significant race/ethnic differences in percent energy from bever-
ages, non-Hispanic blacks reported a lower percentage of daily
energy from beverages and a higher percentage from foods in all
surveys. However, these differences in beverage intake were not
similarly reflected in race/ethnic differences in total energy
intake. We note that our analytic approach differs from that used
in previous analyses that found total energy intake of consumers
of sweetened beverages to be higher than that of nonconsumers
(55). In children and adolescents of all races/ethnicities, the
reported percent of 24-h energy from nonnutritive beverages in
the 1999­2002 surveys was higher relative to 1988­1994 but
declined in the 2003­2008 period. Whether these results reflect
an aberration or a possible beginning of a downward trend in
consumption of these beverages (due to heightened awareness of
their poor nutritional quality) or reporting bias (due to social
undesirability of their consumption) cannot be deduced from the
available data. We await other recent independent estimates of
consumption of non-nutritive beverages to assess if the tide is
turning.
To our knowledge, the only study to publish estimates of
dietary energy density in children from different race/ethnicity
found that non-Hispanic black children had higher energy
density (56). However, these estimates were based on dietary
energy density defined to include all foods plus beverages. Our
results suggest that due to lower overall beverage intake of non-
Hispanic black children and adolescents (a consistent finding in
all age groups), examination of energy density of foods (only) is
more informative about the nature of foods selected. Using this
definition (foods only), non-Hispanic black adolescents, but not
younger children, did consistently report foods of higher energy
density at each examined time period. This may reflect a
preference for certain types of foods that adolescents may
express with increasing autonomy about food selections.
We note that although all NHANES used in the current
analyses collected dietary information using a computer-assisted
24-h recall, the methodology of recall collection in 1988­1994
differed from that used in 1999­2001 and again from 2002
onwards (38). To our knowledge, there are no published
bridging studies to determine the contribution of change in
methodology to population estimates. Nevertheless, it is gener-
ally accepted that the AMPM for collecting dietary recall,
implemented in 2002, have improved the completeness of the
recall (57,58). However, the published validation studies of the
AMPM have studied adults and not children and adolescents. If
we accept that the newer recall methods have improved the
completeness of recalled intake, we should expect the amount of
foods and beverages and total energy intake to be higher in later
surveys. However, we observed no such trends. Nevertheless, we
were mindful of the potential methodological differences and
confine our narrative of results and discussion to whether the
association of race/ethnicity and diet changed over time. In each
survey, dietary assessment methods used for all race/ethnic
groups were the same; therefore, our approach allows valid
conclusions about this primary study objective.
The dietary and meal attributes reported in this paper were
derived from a single 24-h recall. Because of intra-individual
variability of food intake, estimates from a single 24-h recall are
not appropriate for the estimation of usual intakes of individ-
uals, examination of population distributions of usual intake, or
prevalence of nutrient adequacy; therefore, we did not attempt

such analyses (59). However, the regression-adjusted means of
observed 24-h dietary attributes examined in the present
analyses are considered as appropriate for estimation of mean
usual intakes of groups (59).
Another concern with dietary measurement pertains to
dietary reporting errors, especially underreporting of food
intake (59). The problem of dietary reporting error may be
greater in the age groups we studied for a variety of reasons
(60,61). It is possible that with increasing adiposity and health in
the spotlight, the population may be wary of reporting dietary
behaviors that are perceived negatively, with a consequent
increase in prevalence of biased dietary reporting over time. We
note that our analytic approach adjusted for several possible
correlates, such as income, education, and body weight, of
dietary underreporting. Also, the mean ratios of EI:BEE (a rough
indicator of possible low energy reporting status) and the
percentage of the population below an EI:BEE of ,0.92
appeared to be similar across race groups in the 3 surveys
(Table 1). Finally, the results of time trends for energy intake
after exclusion of possible underreporters were generally similar
to those without exclusions (Supplemental Table 7). Gibson also
did not observe an increase in energy intakes of British children
from 1987 to 1993 with or without adjustment for low energy
reporting (62). Nevertheless, because the NHANES dietary data
are used for national nutrition monitoring, meaningful inter-
pretation of these data for children requires more study of
reporting bias, especially using the AMPM, race/ethnic differ-
ences in the nature and extent of underreporting, and possible
drift in dietary reporting.
The reasons for lack of concordance between race/ethnic
differences in the trajectory of changes in body weight but
generally unchanged energy intake or modest changes in other
dietary behaviors are likely to be complex and may reflect the
above-discussed issues about validity of methods used to
estimate dietary intakes in these surveys (9) or possible contri-
bution of the energy expenditure side of the energy balance
equation.
In conclusion, although the direction of changes in dietary
attributes appeared to be similar in all race/ethnic groups, there
is a suggestion of convergence due to somewhat larger changes
in possibly adverse dietary behaviors in non-Hispanic blacks,
especially adolescents. However, the magnitude of observed
changes in dietary behaviors was modest and not accompanied
by changes in energy intake. There is a continued need for
understanding dietary contributors to positive energy balance in
children and adolescents from all race/ethnic groups of the U.S.
population.
