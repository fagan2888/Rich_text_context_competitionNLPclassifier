Patterns in Functioning Among Residents of
an Affordable Assisted Living Housing Facility
Stephanie J. Fonda, PhD,1 Elizabeth C. Clipp, RN, PhD,2
and George L. Maddox, PhD3
Purpose: This is the second article reporting a project that
(a) characterized the longitudinal functional patterns of
residents in an affordable, assisted living housing (ALH)
milieu for low-income people and (b) compared the ALH
residents' functional patterns with those for similarly low-
income, community-dwelling people. Design and Meth-
ods: Functioning was defined as the ability to perform ac-
tivities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily
living and respondents' competing risks such as death
and institutionalization. The comparison samples were
selected from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and
the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old
(AHEAD) study. The analyses involved description of
functional patterns and multinomial logit models to assess
the relative likelihood that study participants experienced
each pattern of functioning and competing risks. Results:
About 42.4% of the ALH residents had stable high func-
tioning, 32.9% deteriorated (e.g., had increased im-
pairment, institutionalization, death), 3% improved in
functioning, 6% exhibited moderate to severe impairment
throughout the study, and the remainder returned to the
community. Comparison of the ALH residents' functional
patterns with those of the community-dwelling respon-
dents indicated that the ALH residents' patterns generally
were similar and in some ways better, adjusting for so-
cial­demographic factors and health; for example, the
ALH residents were no different (statistically) in terms of
improvement, decline, and death, but they were more
likely to have stable high functioning. Implications: The
results suggest that the affordable ALH milieu enabled
low-income residents to maintain function or cope well
with functional decline. The comparison with community-
dwelling participants provides evidence that the afford-
able ALH milieu was comparatively beneficial.

A basic goal of much recent gerontological re-
search is to delineate patterns of aging and to identify
the many individual and environmental factors that
shape these patterns. This research has suggested
that there is considerable heterogeneity in patterns of
aging in all studied populations; for example, some
older adults experience periods of decline occasioned
by episodes of partial recovery, whereas a majority
experience both sustained good health and stable dis-
ability until the end of life (Beckett et al., 1996;
Clipp, Pavalko, & Elder, 1992; Crimmins & Saito,
1993; Maddox, 1987; Manton, Corder, & Stallard,
1993; Mor, Wilcox, Rakowski, & Harris, 1994;
Verbrugge, 1989). This research has also suggested
that some of the observed heterogeneity in patterns
of aging is due to variation in residential milieu (e.g.,
Bengtson, Burgess, & Parrott, 1997; Hochschild,
1973; Lawton & Nahemow, 1973). Assisted living
housing (ALH)--defined generally as any group
home-like residential program with the capacity to
care for people with disabilities on an as-needed ba-
sis (Citro & Hermanson, 1999; Kane & Wilson,
1993; Maddox, 2001; Pruchno & Rose, 2000)--re-
cently has attracted attention as a potentially benefi-
cial milieu for the physical and mental health of
older people, particularly those not in need of skilled
nursing services (Fonda, Maddox, Clipp, & Rear-
don, 1996; Moos & Lemke, 1994). Empirical sup-
port for concluding that it is an especially beneficial
milieu, however, has accumulated slowly. Even re-
search simply describing the functional patterns of
ALH residents has been limited. Thus, in this study,
we examined the functional patterns of residents of
an affordable ALH facility and evaluated compara-
tively whether the residents had beneficial outcomes.
We focused on a unique group of ALH residents,

specifically low-income residents in an affordable
ALH facility, and compared them to similarly low-
income elderly people residing in the community at
large. The ALH residents were unique because rela-
tively few low-income elderly people live in this type
of milieu (Maddox, 2001).
The growing desirability of ALH as a long-term
care option for older people is evident in the rate at
which it has spread throughout the United States in
the past decade (Maddox, 2001). Although differing
terms for ALH facilities make it difficult to obtain
precise estimates, it appears that ALH has grown at a
rate of 15% to 20% in recent years, making it
among the most rapidly growing type of age-friendly
housing in the United States (American Health Care
Association [AHCA], 1998; Citro & Hermanson,
1999; Maddox, 2001). Thirty-seven states had licen-
sure regulations, were drafting regulations, or pro-
vided Medicaid funding for ALH facilities in the
mid-1990s (Mollica & Snow, 1996). Eight more
states were studying ALH as a possible long-term
care option. Additionally, about 1.15 million people
were living in ALH as of 1998 (AHCA, 1998). This
number is likely to increase substantially as the Baby
Boomers approach late life.
The idea that the ALH milieu could enhance well-
being has its roots in ecological perspectives on ag-
ing, specifically the ecology of aging model (Lawton
& Nahemow, 1973) and congruence models of per-
son­environment fit (Kahana, 1982). Lawton and
Nahemow, in their groundbreaking article, "Ecology
and the Aging Process," (1973), developed the con-
cepts that inform prominent environmental theories
of aging--individual competence and environmental
press. They defined competence as an individual's
cognitive and physical capacity to meet his or her
own needs. It varies from individual to individual
and within individuals as well, often as a function of
factors such as illness and advancing age. This varia-
tion relates to the range of experiences to which
people can adapt comfortably. Environmental press
refers to the aspects of settings with which people
continually interact that activate their needs and that
can be challenging, neutral, or supportive. Highly
competent people fare better in environments that
have more press and that promote autonomy,
whereas less competent people fare better in environ-
ments with less press and more security (Lawton &
Nahemow, 1973; Parmelee & Lawton, 1990). A
congruence model focuses on the fit between individ-
uals' competencies and the demands of their environ-
ments. When fit between the characteristics of the en-
vironment and the needs of older people is achieved,
personal well-being results (Kahana, 1982).
The model of selective optimization with compen-
sation also emphasizes the contribution of environ-
ment to well-being. In this model, selection is the
process whereby older people redefine their goals
and modify their normal activities, goals, and envi-
ronments in response to changes (usually losses) in
their personal abilities or resources (M. M. Baltes &
Carstensen, 1996; P. B. Baltes & Baltes, 1990). As an
example, an older woman who relocates to a smaller
apartment because her spouse dies or because she
can no longer maintain a house engages in selection.
The choices people make when they redefine their
goals and choose modifications are probably shaped
by their feelings of self-efficacy and agency (Bandura,
1977, 1982). Compensation is the process whereby
older people find new ways to maintain existing
goals (i.e., they do not modify their goals, as they do
in the selection process) in response to changes in
their abilities or resources. Older people who pur-
chase housekeeping services when they can no longer
keep house themselves, for example, are compensat-
ing according to this model. Optimization refers to
the process by which older people relearn how to do
things for themselves and thereby regain functioning,
health, autonomy, and so forth. Older people who
behave more autonomously after moving out of
overprotective settings into environments designed to
enhance independence have experienced optimiza-
tion (M. M. Baltes & Carstensen, 1996). The ideali-
zation of ALH seems to lie in its promise to provide
reliably available, as-needed compensatory care for
people whose physical resources decline as well as
opportunities for optimization among those who
find they have physical reserves on which to draw.
A substantial literature focusing on earlier forms
of congregate housing for older people suggests that
the expectations of environmental models of aging
and the model of selective optimization with com-
pensation are largely realistic (e.g., Carp, 1966,
1974, 1977; Cohn & Sugar, 1991; Lawton & Co-
hen, 1974; Moos & Lemke, 1994; Sherwood, Mor-
ris, & Ruchlin, 1986; Wetle, 1991). Of particular
relevance to our study is the research showing the re-
lationship in the context of noninstitutional milieus.
For example, in a longitudinal, quasi-experimental
investigation of aged residents living in a congregate
facility, Carp (1966, 1974, 1977) found that the fa-
cility's residents reported better mental and physical
health and were more active than sociodemographi-
cally similar people living in the community. Simi-
larly, Lawton and Cohen (1974) compared the well-
being of older adults who moved to five senior hous-
ing facilities with older adults who remained in place
in the community. They found that the people who
relocated to the senior housing facilities had poorer
physical functioning relative to the community-
dwelling people, but were better off in terms of
morale and satisfaction with their housing. Moos
and Lemke (1994), in one of the most far-reaching
studies of person­environment interaction to date,
observed the health and well-being of residents in
over 262 nursing homes, residential care facili-
ties, congregate apartments, and veteran's facilities.
They found that residents of settings with socio-
economically homogeneous populations and high
levels of activity reported more involvement in on-
site, organized events, regardless of their level of
disability. In addition, residents who lived in facili-
ties with more prosthetic features (e.g., hall railings,
nonskid floor surfaces, etc.) reported higher levels of
180 The Gerontologist
independence. Studies such as these suggest that mi-
lieu is linked to maintenance or improvements in
health and individuals' abilities to adapt to problems.
Few studies have examined the relationship be-
tween the newer ALH milieu and residents' well-being,
however, and studies that have are inconclusive. For
example, Grayson, Lubin, and Van Whitlock (1995)
compared the depressive affect of people living in an
ALH facility with that of people residing in the com-
munity. They found that the depressive affect of the
ALH residents was, on average, worse than that of
the community residents. The cross-sectional design
of that study makes it difficult to know whether the
affective functioning of the people in the ALH setting
had improved or would improve over time and thus
was beneficial (or not) for residents. In another
study, Pruchno and Rose (2000) compared the mor-
tality rates, need for higher levels of care, cognitive
status, depression, and subjective health of people in
an ALH facility with people in a nursing home and
found that the ALH residents were no better off than
the nursing home residents were across all of the
health outcomes they observed. They speculated
that, because the ALH facility and the nursing home
they observed were owned and operated by the same
parent organization, their milieus might have been
too similar to have meaningfully different effects on
resident's well-being.
The study reported in this article was motivated
by the scarcity of research on the functioning of ALH
residents per se. The first objective was to character-
ize the individual-level, longitudinal functional pat-
terns of older residents in an affordable, defined
ALH milieu. Individual-level functional patterns are
the temporal changes that each person experienced
in their ability to perform everyday self- and home-
care tasks. The categories used in our character-
ization of individual-level functioning (e.g., stable
high functioning, stable low functioning, etc.) were
adapted from a rubric developed by Clipp, Pavalko,
and Elder (1992). The second objective was to com-
pare the ALH residents' functional patterns with
those for similarly low-income people who lived in
the community, thereby providing evidence for
whether the ALH residents had more or less benefi-
cial outcomes. Given the tenets of environmental
models of aging, the possibilities for optimization in
the ideal ALH facility, and research on earlier forms
of congregate housing, one might expect the ALH
residents to have better outcomes than their commu-
nity-dwelling counterparts. Or, given findings from
the few studies focusing on ALH residents per se as
well as explanations for why people move to congre-
gate housing (e.g., in response to current or antici-
pated deterioration in health; Aday & Andersen,
1974; Andersen & Aday, 1978; Andersen & New-
man, 1973; M. M. Baltes & Carstensen, 1996), one
might expect the ALH residents to have less benefi-
cial outcomes. As a compromise, we posed a null
hypothesis that the functional patterns of the ALH
residents would be no different from those of their
community-dwelling counterparts.
Methods
Participants
Defining an ALH Population.--The context for this
research was a new, affordable ALH facility in North
Carolina. This facility was affordable because people
were eligible for residency only if their incomes were
60% or less than the 1993 to 1994 median income
for the county, or about $16,000 per year, and rent
assistance was available to most residents. The
North Carolina Department of Health and Human
Resources differentiates between two types of ALH:
rest homes (adult care and family care) and multi-
unit housing with services (MUHS). Rest homes
serve people who require at least some care in a
structured, institutionalized, moderately staffed envi-
ronment. Residents usually have one private room
that they cannot lock, and they share bathrooms and
kitchens. On-site, licensed staff provide the rest
home residents with housekeeping services and per-
sonal care. MUHS, by contrast, provides an environ-
ment that is minimally restrictive and maximizes au-
tonomy. Residents have private, lockable living space
with their own kitchens and bathrooms, and they re-
ceive housekeeping services and personal care on an
as-needed basis through off-site agencies. The ALH
facility observed in this project is an example of the
MUHS model.
Preliminary to characterizing the individual-level,
longitudinal functional patterns of the ALH resi-
dents, we confirmed that this ALH facility was indeed
supportive while also facilitating resident autonomy.
We did so using the Multiphasic Environmental As-
sessment Procedure, which Moos and Lemke (1992,
1994) designed and used to characterize hundreds of
congregate care facilities, nursing homes, and apart-
ments for older people. We found that the ALH facil-
ity we studied had more features facilitating resident
autonomy, such as prosthetic aids and availability of
personal space, than the average apartment Moos
and Lemke observed. It had fewer features providing
social and cognitive support, such as social­recre-
ational aids, orientation aids, safety features, and
staff oversight, than did the average nursing home
Moos and Lemke observed. There was more cohe-
sion among the residents and interaction between the
staff and residents at the ALH facility we studied
than in the average age-segregated apartment Moos
and Lemke studied, but less cohesion in the ALH fa-
cility than in the average congregate care facility. In
short, the ALH facility we studied appears to provide
a reasonably supportive social environment.
This article reports on the first cohort of older res-
idents who moved into the ALH facility when it
opened in 1993 (N  92). An ALH staff member ob-
tained information about each resident's functioning
using the Duke Service Outcome Screen (SOS),
which is a short form of the Older Americans Re-
sources and Services Multidimensional Functional
Assessment Questionnaire (Fillenbaum, 1988; Fillen-
baum, Dellinger, Maddox, & Pfeiffer, 1978). The
SOS asks about social demographics, general health
181
Vol. 42, No. 2, 2002
status, functional status, social support, housing ade-
quacy, economic status, and emotional well-being.
The questions about functioning in the SOS profile
were designed to be consistent with those included in
population-based surveys of older people, such as the
National Long Term Care Survey. This article pre-
sents SOS information obtained from ALH residents
during three observations: before they moved into
the facility, after 1 year of residency, and after 2
years of residency.
Comparison Samples.--We faced several challenges
when selecting an appropriate benchmark for the
ALH residents. First, because people with lower in-
comes tend to experience worse health outcomes
than people with higher incomes do (e.g., Bunker,
Gomby, & Kehrer, 1989; Clark & Maddox, 1992;
House et al., 1994; Kaplan & Lynch, 1997; Roberts
& House, 1994; Williams & Collins, 1995), it was
important that the comparison sample or samples be
similarly low income. Second, the ALH residents
were 50 years of age or older, so it was necessary
that the comparison sample or samples were as well.
Third, we required at least two observations of the
comparison sample or samples, 2 years apart, so
that we could delineate their functional patterns
over the same span of time that the ALH residents
were observed. Finally, it was necessary that evalua-
tions of the comparison samples cover the same do-
mains covered in the SOS profile, especially func-
tional status. The Duke Established Populations for
Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) ini-
tially seemed an obvious choice for a comparison
sample because it sampled older people residing in
North Carolina; however, the Duke EPESE used a
different schedule for including the full set of ques-
tions about functioning and it sampled an older co-
hort (i.e., people aged 65 and older at baseline). In-
stead, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and
the Asset and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old
(AHEAD) study together met most of our selective
criteria.
The HRS and AHEAD study are nationally repre-
sentative, prospective studies of community-dwell-
ing middle-aged and older Americans, designed to
investigate their health transitions and how these
transitions affect finances, formal and informal sup-
port, family dynamics, and health care. They sur-
veyed several, nonoverlapping cohorts enrolled at
different time points: (a) the HRS cohort of people
born between 1931 and 1941 (i.e., aged 51­61
years), studied since 1992; and (b) the AHEAD co-
hort of people born in 1923 or earlier (i.e., aged 70
years or older), studied since 1993/1994. The HRS
reinterviewed respondents in 1994, 1996, and 1998
and the AHEAD study reinterviewed respondents in
1995/1996 and 1998. Because the format of certain
questions in these surveys changed between baseline
and the first follow-up interview, making longitudi-
nal analysis with those particular interviews prob-
lematic, we used the 1996 and 1998 interviews of
the HRS and the 1995/1996 and 1998 interviews
of the AHEAD study. The availability of only two
data points over the 2-year intervals for the HRS
and AHEAD study meant that we could observe
only transitions (not nonlinear trajectories) for these
respondents.
Our comparison samples obtained from the HRS
and AHEAD consisted of Caucasian and African
American respondents who completed the questions
about their functional status and had household in-
comes of $16,000 per year or less (standardized to
1993 levels to be consistent with the ALH residents).
We excluded the small number of survey respondents
who were living in senior housing, retirement com-
munities, and other types of noninstitutional housing
that provided services. This yielded samples of 1,759
HRS respondents and 2,258 AHEAD respondents.
Measures
The analyses reported here measured functional
patterns in terms of the participants' self-reported
abilities to perform activities of daily living (ADLs)
and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).
ADL indicators common to the interviews for the
ALH residents, the HRS respondents, and the
AHEAD respondents included bathing, transferring
in and out of bed, dressing, eating, using the bath-
room, and walking. IADL indicators included pre-
paring meals, taking medications, managing money,
using the telephone, and shopping for groceries. Sim-
ilar to other examinations of functional patterns
(Anderson et al., 1998; Manton, Corder, & Stallard,
1997), we categorized individuals' functional abili-
ties as independent (i.e., with no IADL and ADL
difficulties), as IADL disabled only, or as ADL dis-
abled. For follow-up observations, we had measures
indicating whether the participants relocated to
more care-intensive milieus (e.g., rest homes, nursing
homes), died, or left the study for other reasons. For
the ALH residents, these other reasons included relo-
cation to the community because they needed more
care from family caregivers or they wanted to live
alone. ALH staff did not always know or note which
reason applied. For the community respondents, the
other reasons for leaving the study included refusal
or nonresponse.
Several social­demographic and health variables
were incorporated into this study as well. These were
age, race (Caucasian or African American), gender,
household income, number of life-threatening health
conditions that the participants had (i.e., cancer,
stroke, heart problems, and diabetes), and number of
debilitating health conditions that the participants
had (i.e., arthritis, high blood pressure, hearing prob-
lems, and vision problems).
Analyses
The analysis consisted of two parts. The first was
primarily descriptive, involving application of Clipp
and associates' (1992) scheme for characterizing in-
dividual-level, longitudinal patterns in functional sta-
tus. Their scheme included constant good health, de-
182 The Gerontologist
cline at the end of life, decline and recovery, constant
poor health, and linear decline. Similarly, our catego-
ries included stable high functioning, stable low
functioning, decline, improvement, and competing
risks such as institutionalization. We identified the
rates at which patterns occurred among the ALH res-
idents using information obtained from three data
points: before they moved into the facility (baseline),
after 1 year of residency (Wave 2), and after 2 years
of residency (Wave 3). Inasmuch as the categories re-
fer to strictly linear patterns, they apply to patterns
defined by two data points as well.
A quasi-experimental approach characterized the
second part of the analysis (Campbell & Stanley,
1963). We compared the rates at which each pattern
of functioning occurred for each group, using the
baseline and Wave 3 observations for the ALH resi-
dents and the baseline and Wave 2 observations for
the community respondents. We then investigated
the relative likelihood that the ALH residents and
community respondents experienced each functional
pattern adjusting for salient social­demographic and
health factors. For this, the three groups were
combined into a single data set (N  4109) and their
functional patterns regressed on variables denoting
study membership (i.e., ALH, HRS, or AHEAD),
age, gender, race, income, debilitating health condi-
tions, and life-threatening health conditions. We esti-
mated a multinomial logit model, using Version 7 of
the STATA statistical software (Stata Corporation,
2001).
Because of the disparity in sample sizes across the
study groups, we were concerned that the effects of
membership in the HRS or AHEAD groups would
overwhelm any effects of membership in the ALH
group when we estimated the multinomial logit
model. To explore this issue, we created 50 data sets
consisting of all the ALH residents and 5% each of
the HRS and AHEAD respondents. The HRS and
AHEAD respondents were selected at random and
with replacement for each data set. This strategy pro-
duced reasonably similar sample sizes across the
study groups. Then we regressed the ALH residents'
and community respondents' functional patterns on
age, gender, race, health, and dummy variables indi-
cating study membership using each of the 50 data
sets (yielding 50 repetitions) and averaged the re-
sults. This approach was similar to bootstrap sam-
pling and estimation. In brief, the results using the 50
smaller samples were very similar to those obtained
using a single data set consisting of data from all of
the respondents, eliminating concerns about the dis-
parity in sample sizes. Thus we report the results
from the first multinomial logit model described
above, using the full, original samples.
Results
The characteristics of the ALH residents and the
community-dwelling respondents are reported in Ta-
ble 1. The average age of the ALH residents was 71
years, about 10 years greater than the average age of
the HRS respondents and 10 years less than the aver-
age age of the AHEAD respondents. More than half
of the participants in all three studies were women.
Although more than half of the participants in all
three studies were Caucasian, the proportion of Afri-
can Americans in the ALH facility was considerably
larger than the proportion in either community sam-
ple. As intended, average household income across
the three groups was roughly similar (ranging from
about $8,000 to $9,500). As of their baseline inter-
view, the ALH residents had 1.02 debilitating condi-
tions on average, which is less than that reported by
both the HRS and AHEAD respondents. All three
groups had less than one life-threatening health con-
dition on average, but the HRS respondents ap-
peared to be healthiest in this respect.
Examination of the ALH residents' unadjusted
functional status when they entered the ALH milieu,
after 1 year of residency, and after 2 years of resi-
dency revealed that the most common pattern was
stable high functioning (see Table 2). That is, 42.4%
of the residents reported that they were independent

in both IADL and ADL functioning at baseline, after
1 year, and then after 2 years. Decline also was com-
mon, with 9.9% reporting loss of independence after
baseline and 1.1% with IADL difficulties at baseline
progressing to loss of ADL functioning. Relocation
to more care-intensive milieus and death also consti-
tuted decline for this group, but warranted separate
mention; that is, 14.1% of the ALH residents relo-
cated to more care-intensive milieus and 6.5% of the
residents died. Improvement in functioning among
residents who remained in the facility accounted for
a small, but notable percentage of the trends (4.4%).
Half of these participants improved in IADL func-
tioning between baseline and the year-1 observa-
tion and then reverted to being IADL disabled by
the year-2 observation. Improvement probably also
characterized the experiences of some residents who
returned to live in the community (see the "Other"
column in Table 2), but the ALH staff did not always
know the reason for departure of all residents in this
category so we cannot comment on the percentage of
residents to which this pattern applied. About 5.4%
of the residents had stable low functioning, reporting
IADL and/or ADL difficulties for the full 2 years of
the study, without decline or improvement.
Comparison of the ALH residents' unadjusted
functional patterns with those found for their com-
munity-dwelling counterparts initially suggested that
they fared slightly worse than the HRS respondents
but better than the AHEAD respondents. (In the in-
terest of brevity, the table used to derive the percent-
age of HRS and AHEAD respondents with each pat-
tern is not shown here but is available from the
authors on request.) Compared with HRS respon-
dents, about 10.9% fewer of the ALH residents had
stable high functioning, 5.3% fewer improved, 2.4%
fewer died, and 14.0% more moved into institu-
tional milieus during the 2-year period analyzed in
this study (see Figure 1). Compared with AHEAD re-
spondents, about 10.3% more of the ALH residents
had stable high functioning, 4.9% fewer declined in
functioning, and about 9.3% fewer died. In only one
respect did the ALH residents fare worse than the
AHEAD respondents--about 14.0% more ALH resi-
dents than AHEAD respondents moved into institu-
tional milieus. Between 10.0% and 17.6% fewer
ALH residents had stable low functioning than did
HRS and AHEAD respondents; this is interesting be-
cause, given the prosthetic aids that were part of the
physical setting of the ALH facility, one might expect
it to attract more people with stable low functioning.
The multinomial logit model in which the func-
tional patterns were regressed on important risk fac-
tors and study variables denoting study membership
(i.e., ALH, HRS, or AHEAD) provided a more com-
plete view of the differences suggested by the unad-

justed percentages (see Table 3). The results indi-
cated that the average HRS and AHEAD respondent
was no more or less likely to have improved, de-
clined, or died, adjusting for age, gender, race, in-
come, debilitating health conditions, and life-threat-
ening health conditions. This finding is consistent
with our null hypothesis. The average HRS and
AHEAD respondent, however, was significantly less
likely to have moved to an institutional setting and
to have dropped from the study for other reasons.
The most striking finding was that the average HRS
and AHEAD respondent was more likely to have ex-
perienced stable low functioning than the average
ALH resident was (3.6 and 2.7 times more likely, re-
spectively). Another way of stating this result is that
the average community-dwelling respondent was less
likely to have had stable high functioning than was
the average resident in ALH (.28 and .37 times less
likely, respectively). This countered our null hypoth-
esis but was consistent with the theoretical expecta-
tions of environmental models of aging and the con-
struct of selective optimization with compensation.
Discussion
Gerontologists have long argued for the role of
supportive housing milieus in preserving health and
effective functioning in later life. Recently many have
pointed to ALH as a particularly beneficial milieu for
older people potentially in need of care, but to date
there are few studies of actual functioning to support
this belief. This article characterizes the functional
patterns of older residents over the first 2 years in an
affordable ALH facility. By affordable, we mean that
the facility was for low-income people. Functioning
was measured in terms of participants' self-reported

abilities to perform ADLs and IADLs and by their
competing risks (e.g., death). To determine how well
the ALH residents fared, this article compared their
functional patterns with those for similarly low-
income respondents of two community panel stud-
ies--the HRS and AHEAD study.
Several limitations of this study require comment
before we summarize the results. First, because the
ALH residents we observed were from lower socio-
economic backgrounds and were cognitively intact
when they moved into the facility, the generality of
our results are obviously limited. The reason is that
people with lower socioeconomic status (SES) tend
to experience worse health than do people with
higher SES (e.g., Bunker, Gomby, & Kehrer, 1989;
Clark & Maddox, 1992; House et al., 1994; Kaplan
& Lynch, 1997; Roberts & House, 1994; Williams
& Collins, 1995). Thus we do not know what our
findings imply about the functional patterns of ALH
residents with higher SES. This is a drawback be-
cause ALH is a much more common option for
higher SES people than it is for lower SES people.
Moreover, the functional patterns of people with
diminished cognitive abilities are probably worse
than those of their higher functioning counterparts
as well (Fitzgerald, Smith, Martin, Freedman, &
Wolinsky, 1993; Kasper, 1990). Again, we do not
know what the findings of this study imply about the
functional patterns of more cognitively impaired
people. Generalization to all ALH residents, how-
ever, was not a chief goal of this analysis; rather, we
wanted to provide a rare look at the functional pat-
terns of this special population. To our knowledge
this is the first examination of functional patterns of
low-income elderly people in ALH.
Second, although the two benchmark surveys rep-
resent community-dwelling older Americans aged 51
to 61 years and 70 years or older, they do not pro-
vide perfect comparison or control groups for the
ALH residents we studied. One reason is that, until
the studies merged in 1998, they did not include the
cohort of people born after 1923 and before 1931.
Our bootstrapping test partially dealt with the non-
random inclusion of certain age groups, however,
and still yielded results consistent with those re-
ported in Table 3. In addition, we know little about
the survey respondents' milieus. It is possible that the
people who lived in the community were less predis-
posed toward, or in need of, ALH or other types of
long-term care settings when they were sampled (see
Aday & Andersen, 1974; Andersen & Aday, 1978;
Andersen & Newman, 1973). What this study re-
veals then, is a sense of how the functional patterns
of the ALH residents living in a defined milieu com-
pared with the functional patterns of community-
dwelling people in average, undefined environments.
This average was affected by variation in the physical
supports to which residents had access, the safety of
their settings, other people living in their settings,
their access to services, and so forth. Obtaining in-
formation about community-dwelling older adults,
their settings, characterizing their functional pat-
terns, and then comparing their functional patterns
to those for ALH residents represent an area of fur-
ther study. This information would facilitate for-
mal, systematic tests of the person­environment
relationship.
Third, it is difficult to know how to interpret the
patterns we observed for the ALH residents. Are the
patterns unique to these ALH residents or did resi-
dence in the ALH really have a favorable effect? Am-
biguity regarding our findings is due to the homoge-
neity of the ALH residents at baseline. That is, 73%
were independent and only 10% had ADL limita-
tions (Table 2). Given the potential for ceiling and
floor effects in our dependent variable (i.e., respon-
dents with functional limitations had more opportu-
nity to improve than did those with none and vice
versa) and the observation that most people who are
independent tend to remain so over time (Crimmins
& Saito, 1993; Manton et al., 1993), how much
change can we expect to see? Still, there was suffi-
cient variability in the ALH residents' functional pat-
terns over time to suggest that they were more het-
erogeneous at baseline than indicated by the baseline
data. Also, there were sufficient differences between
the ALH residents and community respondents, de-
spite their similarities with respect to baseline health
and sociodemographics, to suggest reasonable causal
inferences about the relationship of milieu to the
ALH residents' functional trends.
Turning to our initial characterization of the ALH
residents' functional patterns, we documented that
most of the residents experienced favorable out-
comes of some sort. These favorable outcomes in-
cluded stable high functioning, improvements in
IADL and ADL functioning, and stable low function-
ing. We counted residents who experienced stable
low functioning among those who have favorable
outcomes because we believe their continued tenure
in the facility suggests that the ALH milieu enabled
this at-risk group to live independently (possibly
through compensation) and to avoid further deterio-
ration in functioning and institutionalization. To-
gether, stable high functioning (by far the most com-
mon pattern of the three), improvement, and stable
low functioning accounted for at least 52% of the
ALH residents' experiences. We suspect that this per-
centage would have been higher if there were more
information available about the residents who re-
turned to the community during the study. The other
functional patterns of the ALH residents included de-
cline in functioning, relocation to more care-inten-
sive milieus, and death. These patterns together ac-
counted for the remainder of the ALH residents'
experiences. Their high prevalence was not particu-
larly surprising; people at risk of worsening health
tend to move into milieus where they can live more
comfortably with those problems and/or receive care
(Andersen & Newman, 1973; Wolinsky & Johnson,
1991). Thus many of the ALH residents probably
were at elevated risk from the outset and the preva-
lence of these patterns captured some of that. We
know from the prevalence of improvement and sta-
186 The Gerontologist
ble low functioning, however, that in spite of being
at risk of worsening health, optimization was possible.
Although it was important to characterize the
functional patterns of the ALH population, it was
unclear, without benchmarks, what those patterns
indicated about the comparative well-being of the
ALH residents. One of the most important contribu-
tions of this study is its juxtaposition of the ALH res-
idents' patterns with those identified among commu-
nity-dwelling people. The (adjusted) results indicate
that the ALH residents were no more or less likely to
have experienced improvement, decline, and death
than were their community-dwelling counterparts.
This was consistent with our null hypothesis and can
be considered a comparatively beneficial outcome as-
suming the ALH residents were indeed at higher risk
from the outset. But contrary to the null hypothesis,
the ALH residents fared better than their commu-
nity-dwelling counterparts in some ways; specifi-
cally, the ALH residents were more likely than the
community respondents to have maintained high
functioning during the 2-year interval of observation.
This finding was consistent with environmental
models of aging (e.g., Kahana, 1982; Lawton & Na-
hemow, 1973; Parmelee & Lawton, 1990) and previ-
ous studies of earlier congregate housing for older
adults and resident well-being (e.g., Carp, 1966,
1974, 1977; Cohn & Sugar, 1991; Lawton & Co-
hen, 1974; Moos & Lemke, 1994).
An important question underlying this study is
whether or not the ALH model should be generalized
to other older people seeking congregate housing
with services. The implicit criterion for making this
determination is whether the ALH milieu can be
shown to have some positive effect on the well-being
of its residents, including, among many components,
physical functioning. Given the rapid expansion of
ALH in the past decade (AHCA, 1998; Citro & Her-
manson, 1999; Maddox, 2001), however, it is clear
that the ALH model already has been generalized
without evidence demonstrating its positive effects.
Therefore the utility of results such as those reported
here lies in their ability to show for whom and under
what circumstances the ALH model should be gener-
alized. This study suggests that the ALH model holds
utility for low-income older adults by helping them
maintain stable high functioning at rates that reflect
at least two normative samples of older, community-
living people, by providing opportunities for im-
provement and by helping functionally impaired per-
sons attain the goal of independent living through
the provision of as-needed compensatory care.
