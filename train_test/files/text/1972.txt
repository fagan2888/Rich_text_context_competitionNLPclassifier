OBJECTIVE--To assess the cardiovascular risk profile of youths across socioeconomic groups
in the U.S.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--Analysis of 1999­2008 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) including 16,085 nonpregnant 6- to 24-year-olds
to estimate race/ethnicity-adjusted prevalence of obesity, central obesity, sedentary behaviors,
tobacco exposure, elevated systolic blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, non-HDL cholesterol
(non­HDL-C), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein according to age-group, sex, and poverty-
income ratio (PIR) tertiles.
RESULTS--Among boys aged 6­11 years, 19.9% in the lowest PIR tertile were obese and
30.0% were centrally obese compared with 13.2 and 21.6%, respectively, in the highest-income
tertile households (Pobesity
, 0.05 and Pcentral obesity
, 0.01). Boys aged 12­17 years in lowest-
income households were more likely than their wealthiest family peers to be obese (20.6 vs.
15.6%, P , 0.05), sedentary (14.8 vs. 9.3%, P , 0.05), and exposed to tobacco (19.0 vs. 6.5%,
P , 0.01). Compared with girls aged 12­17 years in highest-income households, lowest-income
household girls had higher prevalence of obesity (17.9 vs. 13.1%, P , 0.05), central obesity
(41.5 vs. 29.2%, P , 0.01), sedentary behaviors (20.4 vs. 9.4%, P , 0.01), and tobacco exposure
(14.1 vs. 5.9%, P , 0.01). Apart from higher prevalence of elevated non­HDL-C among low-
income women aged 18­24 years (23.4 vs. 15.8%, P , 0.05), no other cardiovascular disease risk
factor prevalence differences were observed between lowest- and highest-income background
young adults.
CONCLUSIONS--Independent of race/ethnicity, 6- to 17-year-olds from low-income fam-
ilies have higher prevalence of obesity, central obesity, sedentary behavior, and tobacco expo-
sure. Multifaceted cardiovascular health promotion policies are needed to reduce health
disparities between income groups.

Socioeconomic position (SEP) is a
multidimensional construct, em-
bodying prestige, relationships, op-
portunities, and access to resources (1,2).
In adults, low SEP, measured as lower
education level, self-reported economic
difficulties, or impoverished locality,
strongly predicts increased cardiovascular
disease (CVD) risk factors, CVD events,
and mortality (3). Increased adult CVD
risk is also related to adverse early life cir-
cumstances, independent of adult SEP
(2). This relationship may be mediated
by early onset of risk factors that track
into adulthood and accelerate progres-
sion of atherosclerosis (4,5). However,
evidence of the relationship between
childhood SEP and CVD risks in early
life is limited, inconsistent, and suggests
variation by sex and age (6,7).
In the U.S., CVD risk factors are in-
creasingly common in youth, exhibit racial/
ethnic variation, and have been attributed
to a myriad of interconnected factors
(genetic influences, birth weight, paren-
tal BMI, nutrient quantity and quality,
and activity levels) (8,9). Among U.S.
children and adolescents, socioeconomic
disadvantage is common, varies by race/
ethnicity, and persists into young adult-
hood (10). Therefore, examining the
contribution of SEP to emergence of early
cardiometabolic risk may provide insights
into origins of socioeconomic disparities
in CVD risk and has implications for
societal action and policies aimed at pre-
venting and controlling health and eco-
nomic burdens across the life course.
Furthermore, identifying and evaluating
specific, modifiable exposure-outcome as-
sociations and the strength of these rela-
tionships may help guide the design of
appropriate interventions.
We used recent nationally representa-
tive data to determine whether SEP is as-
sociated with prevalence of common CVD
risk factors in U.S. youth, independent
of related sociodemographic covariates
(race/ethnicity, age, and sex).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS--We analyzed data from
National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Surveys (NHANES) 1999­2008, col-
lected by the National Center for Health
Statistics at the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention. This cross-sectional
survey uses stratified multistage probabil-
ity cluster sampling to ensure adequate
representation of the nation's noninstitu-
tionalized civilian population. Trained in-
terviewers conduct household interviews,
collecting demographic, SEP, and medi-
cal history data. Participants are invited

additional questionnaires, standardized
medical examinations (11) (including an-
thropometric measurements), and blood
sample collection.
The study received approval for hu-
man subjects research from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. Sur-
vey instruments and protocols have been
described extensively (11). Overall survey
responserateswere76%(1999­2000),80%
(2001­2002), 76% (2003­2004), 77.4%
(2005­2006), and 75.4% (2007­2008).
The analytic sample included 16,085
participants aged 6­24 years, after ex-
cluding participants who did not com-
plete the examination (n = 660); those of
race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic
white (NHW), non-Hispanic black (NHB),
or Mexican American (MA) (n = 1,652);
those with diagnosed diabetes (n = 76);
and pregnant women (n = 545).
Outcome variables
Measurement and definitions of CVD risk
factors (11,12) follow. Specifically, obe-
sity was defined as BMI (kg/m2) greater
than or equal to age- and sex-specific
95th percentile for youth aged 6­17 years
(13) and BMI $30 kg/m2 for young adults
aged 18­24 years.
Central obesity was defined as a
waist-to-height ratio $0.5 for all partici-
pants (14).
Sedentary behavior was defined as
reporting no physical activity during past
month. Participants aged $12 years were
asked to report frequency and duration of
leisure-time physical activity in the past
month. Physical activity was coded and
classified according to Ainsworth's stan-
dardized scheme (15). Because of modifi-
cation in physical activity assessments in
2007, analyses assessing sedentary behav-
ior were limited to 1999­2006 data.
Tobacco exposure (active and/or pas-
sive) was defined as serum cotinine levels
.73.84 nmol/L (13 ng/mL) (16). Cotinine
was measured using internal diameter
high-performance liquid chromatography­
atmospheric-pressure chemical ioniza-
tion mass spectrometry methods in all
participants.
Elevated systolic blood pressure (sBP;
mmHg) was defined as $90th sex-, age-,
and height-specific percentile (8- to 17-
year-olds) or sBP $140 mmHg ($18
years). The average of three brachial ar-
tery BP readings (taken by physicians after
5 min in a rested sitting position) (11) was
used for analysis.
Elevated glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c
)
was defined as $0.057 (5.7%). HbA1c
was
measured in participants aged $12 years
from whole blood using Diamat HPLC
(high-performance liquid chromatogra-
phy; BioRad Laboratories, Columbia, MO
[1999­2006]) and A1c
G7 HPLC Glyco-
hemoglobin Analyzer (Tosoh Medics,
Inc., San Francisco, CA [2007­2008]). As-
says were standardized to reference meth-
ods from the Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial (12).
Elevated non-HDL cholesterol (non­
HDL-C) was calculated as total cholesterol
minus HDL-C. Levels $3.73 mmol/L (144
mg/dL) equivalent to adult LDL $3.37
mmol/L (130 mg/dL) were considered ele-
vated (17). In all participants, total choles-
terol and HDL-C were measured using
Roche/Boehringer-Mannheim Diagnostics
methods.
Elevated high sensitivity C-reactive
protein (hs-CRP) was defined as $10.0
mg/L (1.0 mg/dL), which corresponds to
75th percentile in published data and in-
termediate CVD risk in adults (18). Indi-
viduals with markedly elevated hs-CRP
($150.0 mg/L [15.0 mg/dL]) were ex-
cluded (presumed to be experiencing
acute phase responses of inflammatory
conditions). Serum hs-CRP was estimated
in all participants using latex-enhanced
nephelometry.
Among participants aged 8­24 years,
we calculated the proportion with 1, 2, or
$3 of the following risk factors: central
obesity, elevated sBP, elevated hs-CRP,
high non­HDL-C, and tobacco exposure.
Data for HbA1c
and sedentary behavior
were not available for children ,12 years.
Principal exposure variable
Household income is a dynamic, poten-
tially modifiable indicator of SEP, reflect-
ing current material resources (2). We
used poverty-income ratio (PIR), an index
of income in relation to family need, de-
rived from household income and feder-
ally established poverty thresholds (based
on family size and annual changes in cost
of living [tracking Consumer Price Index])
(19). We categorized PIR into tertiles (low-
est, T1 [PIR: 0­1.37]; medium, T2 [1.38­
3.25]; and highest, T3 [$3.26]). A small
fraction of 18- to 24-year-olds (5.7%) re-
ported living alone; however, distribution
across SEP strata reflected national levels.
Covariates
Participants self-identified as NHW, NHB,
or MA. Participants' age was categorized
into childhood (6­11 years), adolescence
(12­17 years), and young adulthood (18­
24 years).
Data analysis
Data were analyzed using SAS version
9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and
SUDAAN version 10.0 (Research Triangle
Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC)
with adjustment for NHANES' complex
survey design. We used multiple imputa-
tion to account for missing income data
(n = 1,235). Income was selected for im-
putation because it had the highest rate of
missing cases; missing data on CVD risk
factors (range: 0­16% missing; average:
7.3% missing per outcome) were not im-
puted since these outcomes are less pre-
dictable. Missing income and PIR were
predicted based on race/ethnicity, house-
hold size, and household reference per-
son's age and sex. Ten imputed datasets
were created and imputations were com-
bined. In addition, we performed sensi-
tivity analyses isolating participants with
missing PIR data in a separate category to
identify whether CVD risk profiles in this
group deviated markedly from partici-
pants without missing data.
Following descriptive explorations
of population characteristics, sex-specific
logistic regression models controlling for
covariates were used to investigate the
main effects of PIR on CVD risk. We in-
cludedall first-order interactions andtested
their significance using design-adjusted
Wald F tests to examine whether SEP-
CVD relationship(s) varied by other inde-
pendent variables (age and race/ethnicity).
To estimate the proportion of partic-
ipants with each CVD risk factor in each
PIR tertile, sex- and age-specific predicted
marginal probabilities (a type of standard-
ization in which predicted values from
regression models are averaged over the
entire sample's covariate distribution)
and 95% CIs were estimated. We tested
whether risk factor differences between
PIR groups were significant using Wald
F tests.
We also used multinomial logistic
regression to calculate the proportion of
participants with 1, 2, or $3 risk factors
by PIR tertile and tested for between-
tertile differences and age-PIR interaction
in youth with $3 risk factors.
All tests were two-sided. Results were
considered significant if P , 0.05.
RESULTS--Table 1 presents the socio-
demographic characteristics of the study
population. Of note, 21.4% of children
and adolescents (aged 6­17 years) lived
in households with income below poverty
level (PIR ,1). Among young adults
(aged 18­24 years), this proportion was

26.5%. Those with missing PIR data (sub-
sequently imputed) were more likely to
be 18 years or older, more educated,
NHB or MA, and living in larger house-
holds.
Accounting for age and race/ethnicity
(Table 2) and relative to highest PIR tertile,
lower PIR was significantly associated
with greater odds of sedentary behavior
(Pmales
= 0.02, Pfemales
= 0.001) and tobacco
exposure (Pmales
= 0.003, Pfemales
= 0.003)
in both sexes. In addition, among females,
lower PIR was associated with central obe-
sity (P = 0.001) and elevated non­HDL-C
(P = 0.007). In fully adjusted models with
main effects and all first-order interactions
(results not shown), significant PIR 3 age
interactions were detected in males for
central obesity (P = 0.03) and in both
sexes for tobacco exposure (Pmales
,
0.001, Pfemales
, 0.001).
Table 3 presents the sex-specific mar-
ginal predicted prevalence of anthropo-
metric, behavioral, and metabolic CVD
risk factors among youth by PIR tertile.
We noted statistically significant differ-
ences in risk factor prevalence between
highest and lowest PIR groups. Lowest
PIR tertile boys aged 6­11 years had a
higher prevalence of obesity (T1: 19.9%
[95% CI 16.8­23.0] vs. T3: 13.2% [9.5­
16.9]) and central obesity (T1: 30.0%
[25.7­34.3] vs. T3: 21.6% [17.5­25.7])
compared with their wealthiest counter-
parts. Adolescent boys aged 12­17 years
in lowest SEP groups were more obese
(T1: 20.6% [17.9­23.3] vs. T3: 15.6%
[12.5­18.7]) and more likely to be seden-
tary (T1: 14.8% [11.5­18.1] vs. T3: 9.3%
[6.2­12.4]) and exposed to tobacco
(T1: 19.0% [14.9­23.1] vs. T3: 6.5%
[4.7­8.3]). Across all age-groups in boys
and young men, there were no significant
differences between highest and lowest
SEP in terms of elevated sBP, non­HDL-C,
HbA1c
, or hs-CRP.
Among girls aged 6­11 years, the
lowest SEP group had higher prevalence
of elevated hs-CRP (T1: 3.5% [95% CI
1.9­5.1] vs. T3: 0.6% [20.2 to 1.4]); a
similar pattern was noted for adolescent
girls aged 12­17 years (T1: 4.2% [2.6­
5.8] vs. T3: 1.7% [0.5­2.9]). A greater
proportion of lowest SEP girls aged 12­
17 years were classified as obese (T1:
17.9% [14.0­21.8] vs. T3: 13.1% [10.4­
15.8]) and centrally obese (T1: 41.5%
[36.6­46.4] vs. T3: 29.2% [25.7­32.7])
compared with highest SEP girls. Twice
the proportion of adolescent girls from
lowest-income households were seden-
tary (T1: 20.4% [16.9­23.9] vs. T3:
9.4% [6.5­12.3]) and exposed to tobacco
(T1: 14.1% [10.4­17.8] vs. T3: 5.9% [3.9­
7.9]) than adolescent girls from highest-
income households. Young adult women
in the poorest PIR tertile exhibited higher
prevalence of elevated non­HDL-C (T1:
23.4% [18.7­28.1] vs. T3: 15.8% [11.5­
20.1]) compared with their wealthiest
peers. In girls and women of all ages, there
were no differences in the prevalence of
elevated sBP or HbA1c
between PIR
groups.
Across both sexes and all age-groups,
19.4­42.5% had one risk factor (Fig. 1).
The proportion of youth with 2 or $3
CVD risk factors was greater in older age
categories across all PIR groups. We noted
statistically significant income-group dif-
ferences in risk factor clustering ($3
risks) among boys aged 8­11 years (T1:
5.0% [95% CI 0.7­9.3] vs. T3: 0.7%
[20.7 to 2.1]), girls aged 8­11 years
(T1: 3.1% [0.7­5.5] vs. T3: 0.7% [20.5
to 1.9]), and girls aged 12­17 years (T1:
2.6% [1.0­4.2] vs. T3: 1.0% [0.2­1.8]).
We found no significant age-PIR interac-
tions for the presence of multiple risk fac-
tors (Pmales
= 0.17, Pfemales
= 0.49).
CONCLUSIONS--This study shows
that independent of race/ethnicity, eco-
nomically disadvantaged youth had a
worse CVD risk profile. The pattern of
SEP-CVD risk factor associations was
more noteworthy and consistent for prox-
imal behavioral (sedentary behavior and
tobacco exposure) than for metabolic risk
factors (elevated non­HDL-C, HbA1c
,
sBP, and hs-CRP). This study's findings
add to existing literature that shows house-
hold socioeconomic circumstances (20)
and access (to material, information, social,
and environmental resources) affect health
outcomes through shaping health-related
awareness and behaviors (dietary prefer-
ences, activity levels, and tobacco use) (21).
In our data, socioeconomic disparities

Cardiovascular risks in youth across income groups
(physical inactivity and tobacco exposure)
were similar in both sexes and more
strongly evident among adolescents but
not young adults. This may be related to
similarly high prevalence of behavioral
and anthropometric risks across all in-
come tertiles in young adults. For exam-
ple, we observed large differences between
SEP strata in the prevalence of central
obesity in boys and tobacco exposure in
both sexes, among the youngest age-
groups, which tended to diminish with
age. This highlights how age-related tran-
sitions and social context adjustments
(e.g., adoption of detrimental health be-
haviors in response to different psycho-
social, environmental [school, college, and
early career], or socioeconomic stressors)
may contribute to behavioral and anthro-
pometric changes.
Our data further highlight that the
pathways mediating SEP influences on
risk factor emergence are nonlinear and
complex (22). The sociodemographic and
economic exposures that cumulatively
define SEP are interconnected (1,2,22).
In particular, socioeconomic disparities
in the U.S. mirror race/ethnicity differ-
ences with worse CVD risk profiles noted
among minority race/ethnicity youth
(8,23). In analyses accounting for PIR
(Table 2), we found NHB and MA youth
exhibited significantly higher odds of
obesity, central obesity, sedentary behav-
ior, elevated sBP, elevated non­HDL-C,
and elevated HbA1c
but also lower likeli-
hood of tobacco exposure--these patterns
were broadly consistent with 1988­1994
NHANES estimates (8). Also, in keeping
with previous estimates, lowest PIR group
youth of all races/ethnicities were signifi-
cantly more likely to be sedentary and ex-
posed to tobacco. These findings identify
specific behavioral risks among youth that
can be targeted with health promotion
strategies and highlight that poverty is as-
sociated with health risks among all race/
ethnic groups.
These analyses are, however, cross-
sectional. Thus, temporal and causal in-
ferences are limited, as are estimations of
population-level cardiovascular benefits
from alleviating poverty in lowest PIR
tertiles. We transparently used sophisti-
cated imputation and sensitivity analyses
to address limitations of missing income
data; sensitivity analyses treating missing
PIR data as a separate category showed
CVD risk factor prevalence estimates in
this group were no different from those
in referent highest PIR tertile. Further-
more, our NHANES-derived estimates of

Cardiovascular risks in youth across income groups
households below poverty were consis-
tent with those of the U.S. Census Bureau
(19). Also, although PIR is a robust indi-
cator of current resources, we recognize
that this national-level threshold cannot
account for regional cost-of-living differ-
ences and does not comprehensively rep-
resent the multiple domains of SEP, each
of which provides a unique lens on how
disadvantage affects health. The limited
number of per-survey observations pre-
cluded examination of CVD risk profile
trends over time. Lastly, we focused on
overarching SEP-CVD risk relationships
and could not account for individual var-
iability in growth, maternal and paternal
BMI, and intrauterine exposures.
This study's strengths are the fol-
lowing: large, nationally representative,
high-response rate sample; use of objec-
tive outcome measures; exposure (PIR)
that integrates variations in household
need and purchasing power over time;
design-adjusted statistical methods; and
stratification by age and sex to account
for pubertal changes and/or socially pat-
terned differences between sexes.
Implications
These findings showing greater prepon-
derance of behavioral CVD risks among
youths from lowest-income households
provide two important inferences. First,
viewed in the context of established trends,
these data forewarn of recurring health
and economic burdens. Second, this study
offers insights into meaningful avenues
for intervention, reinforcing that poor SEP
hinders achievement of positive lifestyle
choices. These implications are discussed
separately.
The U.S. Census Bureau (19) estimates
that during the past decade, 16­19% of
those ,18 years lived below the federal
poverty level (for a family of four, annual
household income ,$17,463 [year 2000]
and ,$21,834 [year 2008]). This estimate
has not varied greatly (range 15­23%)
during the past 4 decades (10). Since the
previous national-level reported data (8)
collected 2 decades ago, our findings
show persistent socioeconomic and health
disparities among U.S. youth.
Early life socioeconomic conditions in-
directly affect life course (adult SEP and
health risks) (24) plus foretell low SEP
over ensuing generations. Early life oppor-
tunities (e.g., education) shape future
occupation, income, parity, personal (self-
esteem and resilience) and social capital
(relationships and networks), and invest-
ments in opportunities for the next gener-
ation (1). Moreover, metabolic, vascular,
and orthopedic consequences associated
with CVD risk cumulatively translate
into high health care costs and potentially
less productive life years, further reducing
prospects of escaping low SEP.
Health-related behaviors are estab-
lished early, and CVD risks persist into
adulthood (25). Sedentary behaviors and
tobacco exposure were common among
adolescents but ominously twofold higher
among young adults, suggesting that ear-
lier intervention may circumvent future
burdens. Also, national youth surveil-
lance shows that previous declines in to-
bacco use are leveling off and positive
weight-related behaviors have both been
declining, emphasizing the need to reener-
gize prevention and promotion programs.
However, the complexity of constraints
faced by disadvantaged groups necessitate
that CVD prevention policies address
multiple levels (8,23). For example, since
poverty contributes to low awareness of
health risks, food insecurity, and restricted
choice (21), regulations targeting price and
content of foods and beverages are less
meaningful without greater affordability
of healthy alternatives. In a similar manner,
neighborhood planning and safety are
requisites for promoting physical activity.
Lastly, to achieve population-level benefits,
health promotion programs must reach
low-income minority populations.
This study reports the most recent
youth CVD risk factor distributions across
SEP strata and isolates relationships be-
tween income disparities and health be-
haviors. These results are hypothesis
generating--to reduce health and socio-
demographic disparities nationally, policies
that attenuate the effects of socioeconomic
stressors must be judiciously tested to
evaluate if they enhance the effectiveness
of health promotion strategies. Finally,
since our data predate the current economic

tertile (T) and age-group. *P , 0.05 for difference between T1 and T3 in having at least three risk factors (out of: central obesity, systolic
hypertension, elevated hs-CRP, high non­HDL-C, and tobacco exposure). Multinomial logistic regression models of multiple risk factors con-
