Abstract
Objective: To determine the duration and obstacles to prolonged on-scene cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), and establish how long a pair of emergency medical technicians (EMTs) can
provide high-quality CPR.
Method: Intermediate-level EMTs in Gyeonggi-do Province, Republic of Korea completed a
survey regarding on-scene CPR. EMTs undergoing routine training took part in a simulation using
mannequins. Parameters including compression depth, total number and rate of compressions;
occurrence of incorrect hand position and incomplete chest recoil were collected over 16 2-min
cycles of CPR (32 min total), with EMTs working in pairs.
Result: The simulation study included 43 EMTs. The median duration of on-scene CPR was
3.7 min. Fear of decrease in performance was the main obstacle to continued CPR (n ¼ 188/254
[74.0%]). Standards for high-quality CPR were met at each of the 16 steps of the simulation.
Compression rate increased significantly with time. There were no significant changes in any other
parameter.
Conclusion: Pairs of EMTs maintained high-quality CPR for 16 cycles (32 min) with no decrease in
performance. Our findings could provide evidence to recommend guidelines for duration of on-
scene CPR for cardiac arrest, particularly in countries where the level and number of ambulance
crews are limited.

Introduction
The continuous performance of high-quality
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is
essential to improve the survival of cardiac
arrest patients. The quality of CPR is
determined by six factors: compression
depth, compression rate, accurate location,
full chest recoil, minimization of interrup-
tions, and adequate ventilation
(Figure 1).1­4 Bystanders and emergency
medical technicians (EMTs) may perform
CPR on patients with out-of-hospital car-
diac arrest. In the case of bystanders, the
action of performing CPR has been empha-
sized over its quality.5­8 EMTs, however, are
expected to perform high-quality CPR for a
sufficient length of time, with the aim of
achieving the return of spontaneous circu-
lation (ROSC). Studies have indicated that
CPR quality may decrease over time.9­13
The out-of-hospital cardiac arrest sur-
vival rate in the Republic of Korea is
3.3% for patients with cardiac aetiology.14
Figure 1. Components of high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

In addition, the rate of prehospital ROSC
following EMT treatment is only $1%,14
possibly due to the short duration of CPR
provided by EMTs at the scene (mean
duration, 7 min).15 This is not sufficient to
achieve prehospital ROSC, which is a major
survival factor in out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest.16
The aim of the present study was twofold.
First, we carried out a survey of EMTs to
determine the duration of and obstacles to
prolonged on-scene CPR. Secondly, we
performed a simulation study to establish
for how long a pair of EMTs can provide
high-quality CPR.
Patients and methods
Survey
An e-mail questionnaire comprising 27 items
regarding EMT demographics, CPR dur-
ation at the scene and obstacles to CPR
continuation was conducted with intermedi-
ate-level EMTs in Gyeonggi-do Province,
Republic of Korea. Gyeonggi-do Province is
$10 167 km2 and has a population of just
over 11 million people. There are 962
intermediate-level EMTs and 221 ambu-
lances, which transport a mean of 14.2
patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
per day (mean total, 834 patients per day).
The emergency medical service in the
Republic of Korea is similar to an inter-
mediate-level emergency transport service in
the USA, in that each ambulance is staffed
by two or three EMTs. All EMTs can
provide basic life support with an automated
external defibrillator (AED) and a trauma
resuscitation kit.
Simulation study
Study design. The study included EMTs with
1 or 2 years' experience who volunteered
while attending a training course for high-
quality CPR at the Gyeonggi-do Province
Emergency Medical Education Academy,
Suwon, Republic of Korea. The general
purpose of the study was explained to the
subjects while blinding the specific study
process, data for collection and study
results. No ethical approval was required
because the study was performed during
routine formal EMT education.
Laerdal Resusci Anne Skill Station
(Laerdal Medical, Orpington, Kent, UK)
mannequins were prepared and connected
to the Laerdal Skill reporting system
(Laerdal Medical) with both storage and
printout functions. Compression depth and
accuracy were shown visually. CPR was
performed by teams of two EMTs who
were briefed on a megaventricular fibrilla-
tion scenario in which a 62-year-old man
with diabetes and hypertension (living in an
18th floor apartment) called EMTs because
of chest pain, who then arrived at the scene
to find the man unconscious. The scenario
was prepared in advance and comprised 16
steps. Step 1 involved patient recognition
(checking response, respiration and pulse),
chest compressions during AED charging,
and initial external defibrillation (followed
immediately by chest compressions for 2 min
by one EMT and laryngeal mask airway
insertion by the other). Steps 2­16 each
involved external defibrillation, followed by
2 min uninterrupted chest compressions by
one EMT and positive-pressure ventilation
with a back-valve mask by the other. The
two EMTs reversed roles at the end of each
step, so that each performed eight 2-min
cycles of CPR for a total of 32 min
(Figure 2).
Investigators acted as family members to
simulate a genuine out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest scenario, crying out and gesturing, in
order to stress the EMTs, who gave pre-
pared replies to these `family members'.
Data collection. Data regarding work experi-
ence, age, height and weight of the EMTs
were collected. Compression depth, total
number and rate of compressions, and

occurrence of incorrect hand position and
incomplete chest recoil were collected using
the Laerdal Skill reporting system. After the
simulation, subjects completed a survey
regarding the point at which they felt
fatigued and that CPR quality was affected,
and perceived obstacles to continuation of
CPR (both in the field and in the simulation
setting).
Statistical analyses. Data were expressed as
mean Æ SD, median (interquartile range) or
median (range). Between-sex differences in
CPR performance were analysed using
Student's t-test or 2-test, as appropriate.
The general estimating equation model was
used to adjust CPR data for age, sex, EMT
level (basic or intermediate), and body mass
index (BMI), and between-timepoint ana-
lyses of CPR data were made using a
multivariate linear regression model. CPR
data from the 16 cycles were grouped into
four stages (four cycles per stage) and tem-
poral changes in CPR quality were analysed
using multivariate regression. All statistical
analyses were performed using SPSSÕ ver-
sion 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. P-values < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
Survey
The survey was completed by 254 EMTs.
The median duration of on-scene CPR was
3.7 min (range 0­20 min), with a median of
two cycles (range 0­10 cycles). The max-
imum duration of on-scene CPR was 5 min
(range 0­35 min). Obstacles to the continu-
ation of CPR included: fear of decrease in
CPR performance (n ¼ 188 [74.0%]); com-
plaints of family members (n ¼ 159 [62.8%]);
musculoskeletal pain (n ¼ 112 [44.1%]);
pressure from team members to ``load and
go'' (n ¼ 102 [40.1%]); and lack of confi-
dence (n ¼ 45 [17.7%]).
Simulation study
The study included 44 EMTs, 43 of whom
were included in the final analysis due to a
data storage error for one subject.
Demographic characteristics of the partici-
pants are shown in Table 1. There were
statistically significant between-sex differ-
ences in all demographic characteristics
(age, height, weight, BMI; P < 0.001 for
each comparison; Table 1).
Data regarding CPR parameters at each
step are shown in Figure 3. The standards of
high-quality CPR (as shown in Figure 1)
were met at each of the 16 steps.
Compression rate significantly increased
with time (P ¼ 0.001), but there were no
significant changes in any other parameter.
There were no changes in any parameter
over time when data were grouped into four
stages of four steps each (Table 2).
Data regarding CPR parameters strati-
fied according to sex are shown in Table 3.
Compression depth and the incidence of
incomplete chest recoil were significantly

technicians can provide high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

higher in male subjects than in females
(P < 0.001 for each comparison; Table 3).
The incidence of incorrect hand positioning
was significantly higher in female than in
male EMTs (P < 0.001; Table 3).
Results of the general estimating equa-
tion model of subjects adjusted for age, sex,
EMT level, and BMI are shown in Table 4.
Sex had a significant effect on compression
depth (P ¼ 0.035), and the number of total
compressions was significantly affected by
BMI (P ¼ 0.020).
The post-study survey found that the
median expected onset of fatigue was
4.0 min (range 0­47 min) and the expected
onset of reduced performance was 2.5 min
(range 1­9 cycles). The reported obstacles to
continuation of CPR were fear of decrease
in CPR performance (n ¼ 26 [60.5%]), com-
plaints of family members (n ¼ 25 [58.1%]),
musculoskeletal pain (n ¼ 19 [44.2%]), pres-
sure from team members to load and go
(n ¼ 4 [9.3%]), and lack of confidence (n ¼ 3
[7.0%]).
Discussion
The out-of-hospital emergency medical
system varies between countries and even
among regions within the same country.17
Out-of-hospital management of cardiac
arrest patients may also vary, depending
on the country and region,18 and there is no
universal standard for the duration of on-
scene CPR for patients in cardiac arrest. In
many parts of the USA, paramedics perform
CPR at the scene until the patient achieves
spontaneous ROSC;19 if ROSC is not
achieved, health care providers terminate
resuscitation and declare death at the
scene.20 In many European countries, doc-
tors travel on board ambulances and treat
cardiac arrest patients for the required time
based on their judgement.21
In the Republic of Korea and other Asian
countries (including Malaysia, Japan,
Singapore, and Taiwan), doctors do not
travel on board ambulances and EMTs are
not legally qualified to declare the death of a
patient. EMTs may only provide basic life
support, and use AEDs for rhythm analysis
and defibrillation in patients with cardiac
arrest. Unlike in the USA and Europe, the
protocol in Asia allows for the provision of
CPR at the scene for a relatively short
period of time, followed by transport to
hospital with ongoing CPR.17 The mean
duration of on-scene CPR in the Republic of
Korea is 7.6 min,15 which is shorter than in
the US, Europe, and other Asian coun-
tries.17,22­24 Our survey revealed a median
CPR duration of 3.7 min.
A shorter duration of on-scene CPR
significantly affects survival, as well as the
likelihood of good cerebral recovery.16 It is
difficult to provide high-quality CPR during

transfer to hospital, due to frequent inter-
ruption in the ambulance.25­28 Patients with
ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest are
likely to be in the circulatory phase when
the EMTs arrive, emphasizing the import-
ance of on-scene CPR to ensure return to the
electrical phase. On-scene CPR is performed
for 20 min in the US,29­30 whereas the
7.6-min mean duration of CPR in the
Republic of Korea15 is too short to achieve
ROSC prior to transport.
Concern regarding decreased CPR per-
formance was one of the main obstacles to
the continuation of on-scene CPR in the

present study. Unlike concerns regarding
legal issues, adequate training and education
can correct this misconception. This simu-
lation study found no such decrease in CPR
quality over time could help to dispel this
myth. CPR performance parameters (com-
pression depth, compression rate, hand pos-
ition and chest recoil) satisfied the standards
for high-quality CPR for 32 min in the
present study. Our findings clearly show
that pairs of EMTs working together are
fully capable of providing high-quality CPR
for 32 minutes. Further studies with a longer
time period, involving EMTs of varied
physical fitness levels, are required to deter-
mine the maximum duration of CPR that
can be provided.
Our findings could provide evidence to
recommend guidelines for duration of on-
scene CPR for patients with cardiac arrest,
particularly in Asian countries where the
level and number of ambulance crews are
limited. These data may also assist EMTs in
the USA and Europe, to determine whether
to call for backup.
This study had several limitations. First,
this was a simulation study conducted on the
floor using mannequins. Although stress
and distraction from a patient's family
members were simulated by the actions of
investigators, it was not possible to replicate
all conditions and scenarios. Secondly,
because all subjects participated in the simu-
lation study simultaneously and were able to
watch each other's performance they had
opportunities to correct their own perform-
ance and experimental bias cannot be ruled
out. Thirdly, the fixed duration of the simu-
lation study (32 min) meant that it was
impossible to determine the point at which
performance would deteriorate. However,
30 min of on-scene CPR is generally con-
sidered the maximum,29­31 and we believe
that our findings can effectively be applied to
real-world situations. Finally, this study
used teams of two EMTs, which does not
necessarily reflect reality. In some countries,

ambulances are staffed with three EMTs,
and some regions dispatch more than one
team to critical patients. In these situations,
the potential maximal CPR time at the scene
may lengthen.
In conclusion, in a simulation situation,
pairs of EMTs maintained high-quality
CPR for 16 cycles (32 min) without any
decrease in performance.
