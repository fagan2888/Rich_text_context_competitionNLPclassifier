Background: Most quality metrics focus on underuse
of services, leaving unclear what factors are associated
with potential overuse.
Methods: We analyzed Medicare claims from 2000-
2002 and 2004-2006 for 35 039 fee-for-service Medicare
beneficiaries with acute low back pain (LBP) who were
treated by 1 of 4567 primary care physicians responding
tothe2000-2001or2004-2005CommunityTrackingStudy
Physician Surveys. We modified a measure of inappropri-
ateimagingdevelopedbytheNationalCommitteeonQual-
ity Assurance. We characterized the rapidity (28 days,
29-180days,nonewithin180days)andmodalityofimaging
(computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging
[CT/MRI], only radiograph, or no imaging). We used or-
dered logit models to assess relationships between imaging
and patient demographics and physician/practice charac-
teristics including exposure to financial incentives based
on patient satisfaction, clinical quality, cost profiling, or
productivity.
Results: Of 35 039 beneficiaries with LBP, 28.8% un-
derwent imaging within 28 days and an additional 4.6%
between 28 and 180 days. Among patients who received
imaging, 88.2% received radiography, while 11.8% re-
ceived CT/MRI as their initial study. White patients re-
ceived higher levels of imaging than black patients or those
of other races. Medicaid patients received less rapid or
advanced imaging than other patients. Patients had higher
levels of imaging if their primary care physician worked
in large practices. Compared with no incentives, clini-
cal quality­based incentives were associated with less ad-
vanced imaging (10.5% vs 1.4% for within 28 days;
P.001), whereas incentive combinations including sat-
isfaction measures were associated with more rapid and
advanced imaging. Results persisted in multivariate analy-
ses and when the outcome was redefined as the number
of imaging studies performed.
Conclusions: Rapidity and modality of imaging for LBP
is associated with patient and physician characteristics
but the directionality of associations with desirable care
processes is opposite of associations for measures tar-
geting underuse. Metrics that encompass overuse may
suggest new areas of focus for quality improvement.

INSURERS PRESS FOR STANDARD-
ized measurement of physi-
cians' performance to broaden
programs that link performance
to financial incentives. Existing
metrics focus on patient experience, rela-
tive costs for comparable conditions, and
clinical quality. Yet most currently avail-
able measures on clinical quality focus on
the underuse of services.1 Few focus on the
overuse of services that might induce harm
through complications from unneces-
sary follow-up testing or treatment2 and/or
raise health care costs with little improve-
ment in outcomes. Moreover, if patients
tend to prefer more rather than fewer ser-
vices, programs that only measure under-
use but omit overuse may induce even
more overuse of services.
Policy makers call for the development
of overuse measures and their inclusion in
performance measurement and incentive
programs,3 yetlittleisknownaboutthepat-
terns of care that these measures would re-
veal. To help anticipate the effects of apply-
ing overuse measures, we investigated
associations between characteristics of pa-
tients and their primary care physicians
(PCPs) and the rapidity and modality of
imaging those patients receive for uncom-
plicated acute low back pain (LBP). We fo-
cused on LBP as a prevalent condition4 for
which imaging--particularly with ad-
vancedmodalities--israrelyindicated,even

(CTS) Physician Surveys. Samples for these nationally repre-
sentativesurveysareclusteredin60metropolitanstatisticalareas.
Responses from 2000 to 2001 were linked to claims for years
2000 to 2002, while responses from 2004 to 2005 were linked
to claims for years 2004 to 2006. Details on the survey and its
linkage to Medicare claims are described elsewhere.8,9 Our analy-
sis focuses on CTS primary care physicians (ie, specialties of
general internal medicine, general practice, family practice, in-
ternal medicine/pediatrics, geriatrics). The pooled data set in-
cluded information on 4567 unique PCPs and 3 years of claims
for each beneficiary (Figure 1).
STUDY DESIGN
We used the first year of observation in each 3-year period to
identify exclusion criteria and adjust for comorbidities. Using
the second year of observation, we identified beneficiaries as
having an episode of acute LBP if they had relevant diagnostic
codes from an ambulatory or emergency department visit but
lacked similar diagnostic codes within the 6 previous months.
To assess imaging, we examined Medicare claims from inpa-
tient, outpatient, and professional services files to detect ra-
diologic studies of the lower back within 6 months of the in-
cident LBP diagnosis. We derived diagnostic codes used to
identify LBP and procedure codes used to identify imaging pro-
cedures from the measure of inappropriate imaging for LBP de-
veloped by the National Committee on Quality Assurance
(NCQA).10
RESPONSIBLE PHYSICIANS AND
THEIR PRACTICES
Starting with the earlier round of the CTS survey, we used the
Unique Physician Identification Number (UPIN) to identify the
physician who billed for the greatest number of evaluation and
management visits during the entire observation period (Janu-
ary 1, 2000, through June 30, 2002) for a given beneficiary. We
similarly identified eligible PCPs from the later round of the
survey using claims for years 2004 to 2006. We focused on ben-
eficiaries whose "plurality" physician was a CTS PCP. To as-
sess the robustness of our results to methods of attribution, we
conducted 2 separate analyses attributing beneficiaries who (1)
had any evaluation and management visits with the CTS PCP
during the observation period and (2) had their initial LBP di-
agnosis coded by the CTS PCP. To identify whether the imaging
study was conducted in the same organization in which the
CTS PCP worked, we used the tax identification number
associated with each physician's UPIN on claims.
PATIENT POPULATION
Eligible patients were enrolled in Medicare for at least 6 months
after the incident diagnosis of LBP. Thus, identified episodes
of LBP occurred between January 1, 2001, and June 30, 2002,
for the first cohort. For years 2000 to 2002, we included ben-
eficiaries 65 years and older as of January 1, 2000, who were
continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare through the
subsequent 18 months (until June 30, 2002) and did not enter
hospice or nursing homes. We excluded those with end-stage
renal disease or who received care in more than 1 state during
2000. This procedure was repeated for the next CTS round linked
to 2004 to 2006 Medicare claims. We excluded beneficiaries
whose initial LBP diagnosis was coded by a radiologist be-
cause this may reflect patient self-referrals.
To focus on cases of uncomplicated LBP, we used the NCQA
definition10 to identify these episodes in claims. We applied ad-
ditional, more stringent criteria to exclude patients who might
have had a legitimate indication for imaging. Thus, patients
whose claims indicated neurologic deficit, trauma, low impact
injuries, cancer, infection, nonspecific anemias, or constitu-
tional symptoms suggestive of increased cancer risk were ex-
cluded. Detailed criteria for identifying patients with uncom-
plicated LBP are given in eTable 1 (http://www.archinternmed
.com).
OUTCOME MEASURES
In primary analyses, we examined the rapidity and modality
of imaging. We defined rapidity of imaging as an ordinal vari-
able based on timing of the first imaging study--no imaging
(none within 180 days of diagnosis), delayed (within 29-180
days), or rapid (within 28 days). Modality of imaging was de-
fined as a separate ordinal variable--no imaging, radiography
only, or computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging
(CT/MRI). The CT/MRI category included patients who re-
ceived radiography and CT/MRI concurrently or serially. In sec-
ondary analyses, we considered the number of imaging stud-
ies performed within 180 days (none, 1, or 1).
PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS
We included patient sex, race (white, black, or other [because
data on other racial categories in Medicare data are not as re-
liable]), and Medicaid eligibility, while adjusting for comor-
bidities.11,12 Drawing on data from the Area Resources File, we
also adjusted for median household income in the beneficia-
ry's zip code, and the percentage of adults 25 years and older
in the county with 12 or more years of education, as aggregate
measures of sociodemographic status.

PHYSICIANS' FINANCIAL INCENTIVES
We assessed the rapidity and modality of imaging relative to
PCPs' self-reported financial incentives, which included the fol-
lowing: (1) practice ownership (employed, part owner, or full
owner); (2) the overall effect of incentives, derived from re-
sponses to the question "How would you describe your over-
all personal financial incentives in your practice? On balance,
do these incentives favor reducing services to individual pa-
tients, favor expanding services to individual patients, or fa-
vor neither?"; and (3) a composite 9-category variable con-
structed from a set of questions identifying factors on which
physicians' compensation was based (only his or her own pro-
ductivity; only clinical quality measures; only patient satisfac-
tion surveys; productivity and clinical quality measures; pro-
ductivity and patient satisfaction surveys, clinical quality
measures and patient satisfaction surveys, all 3, or none; and
solo practice physicians who were not asked questions on in-
centives). We did not include in this composite responses about
physicians' exposure to incentives based on cost profiling be-
cause this variable was not associated with rapidity or modal-
ity of imaging in bivariate or multivariate analyses.
OTHER PHYSICIAN AND PRACTICE
CHARACTERISTICS AND AREA FACTORS
We considered the individual physician's specialty (family/
general practice vs general internal medicine); number of years
in practice; board certification; and medical school site (United
States/Canadavselsewhere).Practicecharacteristicsincludedtype
(solo/2-person practice, small group of 3-10, medium group of
11-50, large groups of 50, medical school, group/staff health
maintenance organization, and all other types); and the percent-
age of practice revenues derived from Medicare, Medicaid, and
capitation (each categorized as tertiles). We adjusted for radiolo-
gist supply (number of patient care radiologists per capita in the
metropolitan statistical area), and urban vs rural location.13 Fi-
nally, to control for unmeasured market factors, we included a
dummy for each of the 60 metropolitan areas in the CTS sample.
CLINICAL EVENTS
Using claims from the 6-month period subsequent to LBP di-
agnosis, we examined the rate of potential "cascade effects" of
imaging and clinical conditions that might post hoc justify
imaging that beneficiaries received as well as its rapidity. We
considered (1) hospitalization or surgery for LBP,14 (2) com-
plications or progression of LBP, and (3) new diagnoses of low
back fractures or cancers with potential for bone metastases
(eTable 2).
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
We performed ordered logit regressions with either the
rapidity or modality of imaging as the dependent variable
(the referent was no imaging). To assess whether associa-
tions between the CTS PCPs' characteristics and imaging
were influenced by care delivered by other physicians, we
repeated analyses excluding beneficiaries who had visits
with physicians other than the CTS PCP between the dates
of LBP diagnosis and imaging (or within 6 months for ben-
eficiaries who did not receive imaging). To account for secu-
lar trends, we also evaluated the interaction between each
performance incentive variable and the period of the survey
(2000-2002 or 2004-2006).
Analyses were conducted using SUDAAN analytic soft-
ware (release 7.0; Research Triangle Institute International,
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina), which accounts for
clustering of patients within physicians and multiple observa-
tions of physicians responding to both survey rounds. We ap-
plied weights to reflect the probability of sampling and known
differences between respondents and nonrespondents.
Weighted estimates are representative of nonfederal PCPs
providing patient care at least 20 hours per week in the conti-
nental United States and the Medicare beneficiaries whom
they treat.
RESULTS
Of 496 529 beneficiaries who met inclusion criteria and
had a CTS PCP, 35 039 had a diagnosis of uncompli-
cated acute LBP during the 6-month assessment period
(Figure 2). Table 1 gives the characteristics of their
CTS PCPs. Among these beneficiaries, 11 294 (32.2%)
had at least 1 imaging study within 180 days of diagno-
sis; 9637 (28.8%) underwent imaging within 28 days of
diagnosis, and 1657 (4.6%) between 28 and 180 days.
Among these patients, 88.2% had a plain radiograph, while
11.8% had CT or MRI as their initial study. The median
number of days between diagnosis and imaging was zero
(interquartile range [IQR], 0-7) for any modality, 11 (IQR,
2-42) for CT, and 10 (IQR, 3-30) for MRI.

CARE RECEIVED FROM OTHER PHYSICIANS
For the 11 294 beneficiaries undergoing imaging
within 180 days, 2250 (19.9%) were treated by an
orthopedic surgeon between the dates of diagnosis and
imaging. The proportions who visited chiropractors,
neurosurgeons, or rheumatologists were 1619 (16.4%),
170 (1.5%), and 248 (2.0%), respectively. Among
the beneficiaries who did not receive imaging, 15.9%
saw a chiropractor, 0.9% a neurosurgeon, and 2.7% a
rheumatologist.
SITE AND RAPIDITY OF IMAGING
In a third of cases (29%), beneficiaries received imaging
within their CTS PCP's practice organization. In bivar-
iate analyses, the site of imaging was not associated with
the CTS PCP's practice ownership status (data not shown).
This held true irrespective of imaging modality. How-
ever, time between diagnosis and imaging was signifi-
cantly shorter for beneficiaries who received imaging
within their CTS PCP's practice vs those undergoing
imaging elsewhere (mean, 9.5 vs 15.7 days).
IMAGING AND PATIENTS'
SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS
Minority beneficiaries received less rapid and less ad-
vanced imaging than white beneficiaries (24.8% [black],
18.9% [other races], and 29.7% [white] [P.001] for
imaging within 28 days and 9.1% [black], 7.2% [other
races], and 10.8% [white] [P.05] for CT/MRI). Ben-
eficiaries also covered by Medicaid received less rapid and
less advanced imaging vs other patients (22.7% vs 29.7%
[P.001] for imaging within 28 days and 7.3% vs 11.0%
[P.001] for CT/MRI) (Table 2). These results per-
sisted in multivariate analyses (Table 3).
IMAGING AND PCPs' EXPOSURE
TO FINANCIAL INCENTIVES
Beneficiaries treated in practices more reliant on Medic-
aid revenues received less rapid and less advanced
imaging than other beneficiaries (highest vs lowest ter-
tile, 23.8% vs 30.7% [P.001] for imaging within 28
days and 8.9% vs 11.2% [P.01] for CT/MRI). Simi-
larly, patients whose CTS PCPs with greater than 25%
of revenues derived from capitation or who were solo
practitioners received both less rapid and advanced
imaging than those treated in practices receiving no
practice revenues from capitation or who were
employed (Table 2).
Beneficiaries treated by CTS PCPs with variable
compensation based only on patient satisfaction
received more rapid and advanced imaging than ben-
eficiaries whose PCPs were exposed to other combina-
tions of incentives (Table 2 and Table 3). In contrast,
beneficiaries whose CTS PCP was exposed to incen-
tives based on both clinical quality and satisfaction,
but not productivity, received less rapid imaging.
These associations with financial incentives persisted
in multivariate analyses. Interactions between the
round of the survey and each combination of incen-
tives were nonsignificant.

those seeing physicians in solo or 2-person practices. In ad-
justed analyses, beneficiaries treated in larger group prac-
tices were also substantially more likely to receive ad-
vanced imaging (Table 3).

SENSITIVITY ANALYSES
Ourcorefindingsofassociationsbetweenthelevelofimaging
and patient and physician characteristics persisted across
a range of sensitivity analyses. Results were similar when
we attributed beneficiaries who had any visits with the
CTS PCP to that PCP and when we attributed to each
CTS PCP only beneficiaries for whom they had coded the
initialLBPdiagnosis.Ourresultswerealsorobustwhenwe
redefined the level of imaging as the total number of low
back imaging studies that a beneficiary received.
CLINICAL EVENTS AFTER DIAGNOSIS OF LBP
Rates of new cancer diagnoses were similar regardless of
the timing or modality of imaging (Table 4). Hospital-
ization for and complications or progression of back pain
were more common among beneficiaries who received
imaging than among those who did not.
COMMENT
This study focused on the use of imaging for uncompli-
cated acute LBP because it is prevalent, and well-
established guidelines indicate that rapid or advanced
imaging is not beneficial in the absence of specific com-
plicating features or comorbid conditions.5-7
We found that rapidity and modality of imaging for
LBP was associated with nonclinical characteristics of
patients and the physicians and practices that treated
them. Low-income and minority patients and those
treated in smaller practices or practices more reliant on
Medicaid revenues received less rapid and advanced

imaging than higher-income or white patients and
those in larger practices or settings less reliant on Med-
icaid. These results are consistent with previously
reported patterns of care in terms of groups who tend to
receive fewer services, although in our study, the pat-
terns represent better quality care than when measuring
quality in terms of underuse.15,16 Our findings were con-
sistent across the timing or number of imaging studies
and for all modalities. Moreover, patients cared for by
physicians exposed to incentives based on patient satis-
faction received more rapid and advanced imaging.
Conversely, those whose physicians were exposed to
both clinical quality and productivity incentives
received less rapid and advanced imaging.
The association between exposure to satisfaction in-
centives and the level of imaging is not unexpected. Pa-
tients may consider imaging reassuring, and those with
higher socioeconomic status may be more successful in
obtaining testing in this context. 17 However, in contrast
to generally underused services such as diabetic moni-
toring, more rapid or advanced imaging for LBP may not
benefit patients and may result in harm.18,19
Contrary to our hypothesis that incentives focused on
underuse might result in greater potential overuse, we
observed an inverse association between exposure to clini-
cal quality incentives and the level of imaging. These re-
sults should be interpreted with caution because we had
only a small number of observations for some combina-

tions of incentives. Nevertheless, they suggest that quality-
based incentives may improve appropriateness of care in
some unmeasured arenas. This could reflect a broad eco-
logic effect if physicians exposed to existing incentives
become more generally aware of and adherent to clini-
cal practice guidelines.20 Alternatively, physicians ex-
posed to quality measurement may be less vulnerable to
the effects of incentives that encourage imaging.
We also found that exposure to both clinical quality
and satisfaction incentives among a small fraction of PCPs
resulted in less rapid or advanced imaging than with either
incentive alone or no incentives at all. Although some
prior studies suggest that patient satisfaction tends to cor-
relate with clinical quality,21,22 Landon et al23 compared
the experiences of Medicare beneficiaries in the fee-for-
service vs managed care programs and found instead that
the 2 systems had different strengths in quality vs satis-
faction performance. Our findings are also consistent with
those of Weyer et al,24 who reported that improvements
in preventive services were associated with declines in
patient satisfaction. Although our results require confir-
mation in larger populations of physicians facing this rela-
tively rare combination of incentives, it is possible that
physicians less pressured to maximize visit volume can
better align their efforts to perform well on both clinical
quality and patient satisfaction (eg, by spending more time
providing reassurance about deferred imaging). How-
ever, these benefits would accrue to relatively few pa-
tients because far more physicians face productivity in-
centives than other types of incentives.25
We found that one-third of imaging studies were per-
formed within the PCP's practice organization and that
patients treated in large group practices were modestly
more likely to receive rapid and advanced imaging than
those treated in smaller practices. Since large groups are
more likely to have the resources to invest in imaging
equipment,26 our results are consistent with other stud-
ies suggesting that practice-owned equipment results in
supplier-induced demand and physician self-referral.27
These associations were independent of the higher like-
lihood that physicians in large practices were exposed
to performance incentives. They contrast with studies

showing that larger practices tend to outperform smaller
ones in quality improvement efforts and on standard-
ized measures emphasizing underuse.15,28,29
Finally, we found that many patients received imaging
on the day of diagnosis. These care patterns are incon-
sistent with guidelines that recommend a trial of con-
servative therapy first and suggest opportunities for qual-
ity improvement.
Our results should be interpreted within the context
of our analytic approach. We could not determine ap-
propriateness of imaging for a given patient. Ours is a
comparative analysis of the level of imaging relative to
patient, physician, and practice characteristics and not
an attempt to benchmark the behavior of individual phy-
sicians. The inability to identify particular cases of over-
use with certainty does not invalidate our findings be-
cause all physicians are subject to such errors in coding
and ascertainment. As an example, for our results to be
biased, physicians would have to be more likely to code
diagnoses of "red flag" conditions for minority patients
than for white patients at the same time that they are less
likely to order imaging studies for minority patients. Al-
though rates of back pain complications and hospital-
izations was higher for patients receiving more rapid or
advanced imaging, these differences may reflect, in part,
events triggered by the initial imaging study itself and/or
the relative aggressiveness of care delivered by physi-
cians who are more likely to order imaging. Rates of can-

cer diagnoses were no higher for patients who had more
rapid or advanced imaging.
We cannot be certain that each CTS PCP was truly
responsible for imaging decisions for the patients stud-
ied because claims-based attribution may not reflect ac-
tual care relationships.29 However, our conclusions were
robust when using both more liberal and more restric-
tive attribution approaches and when we focused on pa-
tients whose initial LBP diagnosis was coded by the PCP
or those who saw only that physician between the dates
of diagnosis and imaging. Thus, regardless of the in-
volvement of other providers, the level of imaging ap-
pears to be related to the characteristics of a patient's PCP.
Our findings require confirmation with a broader set
of overuse measures but nevertheless have important im-
plications. Development of more overuse metrics would
balance out current measures that are heavily weighted
toward underuse, perhaps by leveraging research on the
comparative effectiveness of different treatment op-
tions.30 It is not surprising that physicians and practices
with attributes associated with underuse of care are less
likely to overuse imaging. However, our results may pro-
vide a rationale for tailoring packages of performance met-
rics to practice attributes. For example, a practice with
high Medicaid revenue, many minority patients, and mini-
mal physician incentives for maximizing patient satis-
faction may be more likely to benefit from measures em-
phasizing underuse. In contrast, practices with less
Medicaid revenue, fewer minority patients, and more sat-
isfaction-based incentives may be more likely to benefit
from performance measures that include overuse.
More balanced measurement of overuse and under-
use might also allow insurers to design incentives to
counter both. For example, insurers could offer higher
copayments for services that tend to be overused but lower
or no copayments for generally underused services. Simi-
larly, bonuses could encourage physicians to avoid over-
used services or increase underused services. Manda-
tory delays in ordering overused services in the absence
of clinical "red flags" is another alternative tool. Such in-
terventions would need to avoid limiting necessary care,
particularly for low-income patients, but in the context
of fee-for-service reimbursement, targeted and balanced
incentives could better align the dual goals of quality im-
provement and cost containment.
Patterns of care revealed by the application of a single
measure of potential overuse point to different foci for
performance improvement than when measurement fo-
cuses on underuse. Given possible reversal in direction
from the typical "quality advantage" for important sub-
populations of patients and physicians, measuring over-
use alongside underuse may be critical for improving the
overall appropriateness of care.
