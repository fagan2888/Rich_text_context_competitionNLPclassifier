Chronicity of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
and Risk of Disability in Older Persons
Amy L. Byers, PhD, MPH; Kenneth E. Covinsky, MD, MPH; Thomas C. Neylan, MD; Kristine Yaffe, MD
Although much is known about the strong relationship
betweengeriatricdepressionanddisability,1-11 fewstud-
ies have examined the effect of anxiety disorders on
disability into later life. Of these studies, most have consid-
ered the association between generalized anxiety disorder
(GAD) and disability.11,12 However, little research has investi-
gated the burden of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)13 and
the occurrence of disability into later life.
Previous research has focused mainly on young veteran
populations to assess PTSD and functional impairment. In
examining archival data from the National Vietnam Veterans
Readjustment Study, investigators found that middle-aged
veterans with combat-related PTSD were at a higher risk of
physical limitations, not working, compromised physical
health, and diminished well-being compared with veterans
without PTSD.14 Research using the Veterans Affairs Norma-
tive Aging Study examined the relationship between depres-
sive symptoms and domains of functioning15 but did not
consider the effect of PTSD symptoms on similar domains.
In studies that have assessed community-based samples of
older adults, anxiety symptom scales have consistently
found a strong association between symptoms of anxiety
and functional impairment.11,16 However, to our knowledge,
the association between PTSD and disability has not been
studied in a national sample using DSM-IV17 clinical diagno-
sis criteria.
IMPORTANCE Little is known about the association between posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) and disability into later life. Most studies of late-life psychiatric disorders and function
have focused on depression and generalized anxiety disorder.
OBJECTIVES To determine the association between PTSD and disability among older adults
and investigate if association differs by chronicity of PTSD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In total, 3287 participants 55 years and older (mean
[SD] age, 66.0 [8.7] years, 60.1% women) involved in the Collaborative Psychiatric
Epidemiology Surveys (2001-2003), including 3 aggregated, nationally representative
studies (National Comorbidity Survey Replication, National Survey of American Life, and
National Latino and Asian American Study). Analyses used weights and complex
design-corrected statistical tests to infer generalizability to the US population.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Disabilitydefinedby5domains(outofrole,self-care,mobility,
cognition,andsocial)usingtheWorldHealthOrganizationDisabilityAssessmentSchedule.
RESULTS Of the 3.7% older adults who had a history of PTSD defined by DSM-IV criteria, 1.8%
had persistent PTSD into later life (age of onset <55 years as well as a recent diagnosis).
Frequency of any disability was 79.7% for persistent PTSD, 69.6% for pre­late life (age of
onset <55 years and age at last diagnosis <55 years), and 36.9% for no PTSD (P < .001). In
logistic regression analyses, adjusting for demographics, smoking, individual medical
conditions, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and substance use disorders,
respondents with persistent PTSD were 3 times more likely to have any disability than were
respondents with no PTSD (odds ratio, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.32-7.64). Global disability results were
nonsignificant for pre­late life relative to no PTSD (odds ratio, 1.99; 95% CI, 0.97-4.08).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Disability in older Americans is strongly associated with PTSD,
particularly PTSD that persists into later life. These findings suggest that monitoring and
treatment of PTSD are important over the long term.

The purpose of our study was to determine the associa-
tion between PTSD and disability in a large diverse probabil-
ity sample of older adults. Moreover, we examine the chro-
nicity of PTSD and its association with disability. We
hypothesize that pre­late-life PTSD and persistent PTSD will
be associated with disability; however, persistent PTSD will
have a much higher magnitude of association compared with
noPTSD.Inaddition,disabilitywillbeattributedtoPTSDabove

Methods
Participants
The Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES
2001-2003), combining 3 national studies (National Comor-
bidity Survey Replication, National Survey of American Life,
and National Latino and Asian American Study), are nation-
ally representative surveys of 20 013 noninstitutionalized par-
ticipants 18 years and older in the United States. The sam-
pling designs and methods of the CPES have been described
in detail elsewhere.18
The current sample consisted of 3287 community-based
adults 55 years and older with a mean (SD) age of approxi-
mately 66.0 (8.7) years. The distribution was 60.1% women,
34.0%white,35.5%black,17.7%Hispanic,and12.8%Asian.The
CPES data were obtained from the Inter-university Consor-
tium for Political and Social Research.19 The institutional re-
view boards of the University of California, San Francisco, and
the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center approved
this study. Since this was an analysis of secondary data, pa-
tient consent was not required.
Measures
Diagnostic Assessment
The CPES psychiatric diagnoses were determined using the
World Health Organization's World Mental Health (WMH)
Survey Initiative version of the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).20 The WMH-CIDI is a fully
structured lay interview that generates lifetime and
12-month diagnoses according to the International Classifi-
cation of Diseases, Tenth Revision21 and DSM-IV17 criteria. In
the present analyses, the DSM-IV criteria were used. The
primary mental disorder examined was PTSD. We evaluated
MDD, GAD, substance use disorders (including alcohol and
drug abuse or dependence), and several medical comorbid
disorders as confounders.
Chronicity of PTSD
We were able to determine whether onset of PTSD was in later
life (age 55 years) vs pre­late life (age <55 years) or whether
it was persistent into later life (ie, age of onset <55 years and
age at last diagnosis 55 years) based on age of onset as well
as age at the most recent diagnosis, defined by the most cur-
rent PTSD diagnosis or the last diagnosis at 55 years or older.
We defined 3 categories for PTSD chronicity during the re-
spondent's lifetime: (1) no history of PTSD; (2) pre­late-life
PTSD, which included age of onset and age at last diagnosis
younger than 55 years; and (3) persistent PTSD in later life,
which included both age of onset younger than 55 years and a
recent diagnosis of PTSD at 55 years or older. Using this defi-
nition, most (95.6%) respondents with persistent PTSD had a
diagnosis within the 12 months before their interview (65 of
68), while 2 respondents had a diagnosis 1 year before and 1
had a diagnosis 7 years previously. Because we were inter-
ested in the chronic nature of PTSD into later life, we ex-
cluded 27 respondents first diagnosed with PTSD after age 55
years. In addition, 7 respondents with missing data on age of
onset and most recent PTSD diagnosis were excluded from the
original sample.
Disability
Disability was defined by 5 domains (out of role, self-care, mo-
bility, cognition, and social) of the World Health Organization
Disability Assessment Schedule.22,23 Out of role was mea-
sured by number of days during the past 30 days when the re-
spondent was completely unable to work or carry out his or
hernormalactivitiesbecauseofphysicalormentalhealthprob-
lems. The other domains were a product of the frequency
(number of days) and severity of problems (none, mild, mod-
erate, or severe) that respondents reported experiencing in the
past 30 days. All domains were scored on a 0 to 100 scale, with
higher scores indicating worse functioning. Because the do-
mains were highly skewed, we examined binary outcomes of
any disability (>0) in each domain. In addition, we created two
global disability measures: (1) any disability measure, de-
fined as any difficulty in at least 1 of the 5 disability domains,
and (2) a standardized global disability score, computed by av-
eraging z scores of all 5 domains.
Other Variables
The demographic variables included in analyses were age, sex,
race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, His-
panic, or Asian), educational attainment (completed 0-11 or 12
years), marital status (married or cohabitating; divorced, sepa-
rated, or widowed; or never married), and income defined by
the poverty index (ie, the ratio of household income to pov-
erty threshold used in the 2001 US census and adjusted for
householdsize;categorizedaslow[1.5timesthepovertyline],
middle [>1.5-6.0 times], and high [>6.0 times]).24-26 In addi-
tion, we determined smoking status, creating a dichotomous
variable for current smoking (yes or no). The medical condi-
tions included in the analyses were those that are prominent
inolderadultsandassociatedwithdisabilityandmentalhealth
disorders, that is, a history of stroke, myocardial infarction or
heart disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, can-
cer, and arthritis.
Statistical Analysis
To produce nationally representative estimates, we imple-
mented clustering and weighting techniques to reduce sys-
tematic bias and imprecision imbedded in the complex sam-
plingdesign.Thus,percentagesrepresentweightedproportions
by PTSD group, with statistical differences estimated based on
the Rao-Scott 2, which corrects for the complex design.27 The

WeexaminedtheassociationbetweenthePTSDgroupsand
global disability, first by assessing weighted logistic regres-
sion analyses and then validating our findings by linear re-
gression analyses. All analyses were also adjusted for demo-
graphic variables, current smoking, individual medical
conditions (ie, arthritis, stroke, heart disease or myocardial in-
farction, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and can-
cer), and lifetime MDD, GAD, and substance use disorders. We
used any disability (ie, difficulty in any of the 5 disability do-
mains) for logistic regression analyses and standardized global
disability scores (z scores) for the linear regression analyses.
Next, logistic regression analyses were assessed in greater
detail, estimating the association of pre­late-life and persis-
tent PTSD in later life with the 5 disability domains. The ref-
erence group was no PTSD. To assess the confounding influ-
ence of other psychiatric disorders (ie, MDD, GAD, and
substance use disorders), we examined 3 separate models:
model 1, an unadjusted model; model 2, adjusted for demo-
graphic characteristics, current smoking, and medical condi-
tions; and model 3, adjusted for variables in model 2 plus life-
time psychiatric disorders. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs were
estimated, along with design-corrected likelihood ratio sta-
tistics and Wald 2 tests.
Statistical tests were 2-tailed with P < .05 defining statis-
tical significance. All analyses were performed using SAS Sur-
vey Procedures, version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Inc). Unless oth-
erwise specified, all results presented are based on weighted
analyses.
Results
In unweighted analyses, the age distribution for the overall
sample was as follows: 49.7% for those aged 55 to 64 years,
31.7% for those aged 65 to 74 years, 15.6% for those aged 75 to
84 years, and 3.0% for those 85 years and older. Among the in-
dividual PTSD groups, the age distribution was as follows, re-
spectively: (1) no PTSD: 48.8%, 32.2%, 15.9%, and 3.1%; (2) pre­
latelife:63.6%,25.0%,11.4%,and0%;and(3)persistent:75.0%,
19.1%, 4.4%, and 1.5%.
In weighted analyses, we found that 3.7% of older adults
had pre­late-life PTSD, with approximately half of these (1.8%)
persisting into later life. Weighted bivariate analyses of demo-
graphic characteristics, current smoking, medical condi-
tions,andlifetimepsychiatricdisordersbyPTSDgrouparepre-

average than those with no PTSD (60-62 vs 68 years old;

smoked compared with 16.3% with no PTSD and 21.1% with
persistent PTSD in later life (P = .004). Of the medical condi-
tions, stroke showed the strongest significant association with
PTSD. As expected, psychiatric disorders were strongly re-
lated to PTSD. Nearly 50% of respondents with pre­late-life
PTSD had a diagnosis of MDD in their lifetime, while for those
with persistent PTSD and no PTSD, it was approximately 40%
and 11%, respectively. The patterns were similar for GAD and
substance use disorder, but the prevalence was lower.
PTSD and Global Disability Score
Across the PTSD groups, frequency of any disability was 79.7%
for persistent PTSD in later life, 69.6% for pre­late life, and
36.9% for no PTSD (P < .001). In logistic regression analyses,
adjusting for demographics, smoking, and medical condi-
tions, respondents with pre­late-life PTSD were 3 times more
likely to have any disability than respondents with no PTSD
(OR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.50-6.48), while respondents with persis-
tent PTSD were more than 4 times more likely to have any dis-
ability relative to those with no PTSD (OR, 4.34; 95% CI, 2.01-
9.36) (Table 2). After additional adjustment for MDD, GAD, and
substance use disorders, the association between pre­late-
life PTSD and disability became nonsignificant (OR, 1.99; 95%
CI, 0.97-4.08; P = .06); however, although there was slight at-
tenuation, the association remained strong and significant for
persistent PTSD (OR, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.32-7.64; P = .01).
For the standardized global disability score analyses, we
found similar results. In linear regression models, adjusting for
demographics, current smoking, medical conditions, MDD,
GAD, and substance use disorders, we found a statistically sig-
nificantdifferenceforpersistentPTSDcomparedwithnoPTSD
( = 0.40, SE = 0.16, t1
= 2.50, P = .01) but no difference for
pre­late-lifePTSDcomparedwithnoPTSD( = 0.08,SE = 0.10,
t1
= 0.80, P = .43).
PTSD and Domains of Disability
Prevalence of disability increased from no PTSD to pre­late-
life to persistent PTSD in later life for all domains of the World
Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (Figure).
For example, prevalence of impairment in mobility was 22.3%,
49.0%, and 58.9%, respectively. Prevalence for self-care was
least impressive (5.3%, 11.8%, and 12.6%, respectively).
In model 1 (unadjusted models) of Table 2, associations
were strong and statistically significant for both pre­late-life
PTSD (3- to 6-fold increased odds of disability compared with
no PTSD) and persistent PTSD (5- to 12-fold increased odds)
across all individual domains of disability, except self-care. Af-
ter adjusting for demographic variables, smoking, and medi-
cal conditions (model 2), results remained similar but attenu-
ated. Estimates were reduced even more after the addition of
MDD, GAD, and substance use disorders to the model with
meaningful changes (model 3). For example, the association
between persistent PTSD and difficulties in cognition re-
duced from an OR of 9.00 (model 1) to an OR of 4.88 (model 2)
to an OR of 3.48 (model 3) (95% CI, 1.63-7.45). In model 3, the

late-life PTSD were mobility (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.26-4.00) and
social disability (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.09-4.87), with difficulties
in cognition marginally significant, while, although attenu-
ated, all persistent PTSD effects remained.
Discussion
This study provides evidence that persistence of PTSD in later
life is a prominent predictor of disability in late life above and
beyond other psychiatric disorders and medical conditions. In
summary, the findings show that persistent PTSD is associ-
ated with global disability. Moreover, persistent PTSD has a
strong association with all individual World Health Organiza-
tion Disability Assessment Schedule domains of disability. Al-
though the statistical difference between persistent PTSD and
pre­late-life PTSD was not tested directly, persistent PTSD had
a higher magnitude of association with disability compared
withnoPTSD.ThisstudyconfirmsthatPTSDisahighlychronic
disorderandthatsuchchronicitycompromisesfunctioninlater
life.
Few previous studies have considered the association be-
tween PTSD and disability, and no study that we are aware of
has examined the chronicity of PTSD and its association with
disability in older adults. Our findings are consistent with re-
sults from Vietnam veterans who experienced severe combat-
related trauma. The National Vietnam Veterans Readjust-
mentstudyfoundthatPTSDincreasedtheoddsofanyphysical
limitationby3-foldandraisedtheoddsofnotworkingby7-fold
(P < .05) in more than 1000 middle-aged male veterans, ad-
justing for demographics and medical and psychiatric
comorbidities.14 Furthermore, in a study of more than 1000
female veterans (mean age, 46 years), those with PTSD had 2
and 4 times more impairment in role functioning and social
functioning, respectively, than those without PTSD.29 How-
ever, unlike these other studies, our study is generalizable to
the larger population of older Americans, assessing chronic-
ityofPTSDintolaterlifeandexaminingglobaldisabilityaswell
as multiple individual domains of disability.
Of the previous nonmilitary studies, only one recent study
that we are aware of targeted older adults. Although this study
foundthatlifetimePTSDwasrelatedtomultiplephysicalhealth
issues, including a reduction in role functioning in late life, the
authors did not assess other specific domains of disability or
chronicity of PTSD.30 Other studies examined small samples
that included young adults. For example, a study of 368 pri-
mary care patients 18 years and older found that those with
current (1-month) PTSD were more impaired in work, family,
and social functioning scales than those without PTSD.31 In a
more recent study of 321 trauma-exposed primary care pa-
tients 18 years and older, the authors found results similar to
our study, where current PTSD was associated with the most
impairment (ie, work loss and social and family impairment),
followedbyhistoryofPTSD,comparedwithnocurrentPTSD.32
In a sample of 95 individuals 19 years and older who survived
the2001WorldTradeCenterattack,highPTSDsymptomswere
particularlyassociatedwithsocial-occupationalimpairment.33
Another study, which assessed 49 patients with 2 or more post-
traumatic stress symptoms during their lifetime and 147 con-
trol participants 18 years and older in the community, found
that social, financial, physical (chronic illness and bed days),
and psychological domains of disability were related to post-
traumatic stress symptoms.34 Our findings build on this pre-
vious work by showing that the effect of clinically based PTSD
on function is evident at the population level and into later life,
when individuals are most vulnerable to disability. In addi-
tion, we assessed domains of disability, besides role and so-
cial functioning, particularly pertinent to older age, includ-
ing mobility, cognition, and self-care.
Multiple studies have provided evidence that depression
is associated with functional impairment.1-11 However, find-
ingsthatPTSDisassociatedwithdisabilityindependentofMDD
and other prominent psychiatric disorders has important im-
plications.Thesefindingssuggestthat,ifleftunresolved,PTSD
in older adults will have significant functional consequences.
Therefore, by identifying chronicity of PTSD as a prominent
predictor, we are able to show that monitoring and treatment
of PTSD are imperative over the long term. In addition, al-
though not as encompassing as persistent PTSD, pre­late-life
PTSDwassignificantlyassociatedwithspecificdomainsofdis-
ability (ie, mobility and social functioning) and only margin-
ally associated with cognition. These findings could be ex-
plained by persistent effects of trauma exposure on functional
status that are not related to having the diagnosis of PTSD or
MDD.
The effect of chronic PTSD on disability in late life can po-
tentially be explained by similar underlying mechanisms of
MDD and disability. It is possible that PTSD itself is disabling
or causes increased disability from other sources, such as
poorer health behaviors.11 The persistence of symptomatic dis-
tressarisingfromtraumaexposureoverthelongtermmayhave
an adverse influence on health similar to models of allostatic
load.35 This may be why individuals with persistent PTSD into

later life are more disabled. One possible pathway is through
dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical
axisfollowingexposuretotrauma.36 Itishypothesizedthatdys-
function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical sys-
tem leads to increased glucocorticoid signaling and hippo-
campal degeneration, which, with repetitive stress responses
totraumacues,maypredisposeanindividualtoadversehealth
outcomes. Another possible pathway may be through execu-
tive-type cognitive impairments associated with PTSD.37
Furthermore,ourfindingssuggestthatthepersistentPTSD
group may be different in other ways besides their risk associ-
ated with function. The higher prevalence of adverse medical
conditions in this group may suggest that persistent PTSD is an
indicator of other health risks. Future studies need to examine
other important adverse outcomes potentially associated with
this group, such as stroke, heart disease, and diabetes mellitus.
The strengths of this study include a large nationally rep-
resentative sample of community-dwelling older Americans,
information on clinically relevant DSM-IV PTSD, and care-
fully measured disability domains. In addition, we at-
tempted to carefully adjust for possible confounding from
medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Finally, we focused on
the effect of chronic PTSD. To our knowledge, our study is the
first to examine the chronicity of PTSD into later life and its
association with disability.
There are limitations of this study. First, the CPES sur-
veys underrepresent older homeless and institutionalized
adults,aswellasold-old(75-84years)andoldest-old(85years)
adults. Thus, given this is a community-based sample of non-
institutionalized older respondents, power for analyses and in-
terpretation of results for the oldest-old respondents are lim-
ited. Second, even though the WMH-CIDI was shown to have
good concordance with the Structured Clinical Interview for
theDSM-IV,38 itisstillalay-administeredinterviewratherthan
a clinically administered assessment. Third, there may be is-
sues of stigma, whereby older adults with mental illness might
be less inclined to participate in a mental health survey. Some
respondents with PTSD also may have been excluded from the
study because of difficulty recalling symptoms. Although it is
possible that older adults may be less likely to remember past
trauma, retrospective reporting of serious events such as
trauma is minimally affected by bias.39 Instead, there may be
a mortality effect, whereby traumatized adults are more likely
to die at a younger age, resulting in an overrepresentation of
nontraumatized older respondents.40 Fourth, the study was
not able to take the number of years with the disorder into ac-
count either in the definition or in the analyses. Further-
more, future research needs to examine other important co-
variates not accounted for in the current study such as
dementia. Finally, the association between PTSD and disabil-
ity may be bidirectional, which suggests further investiga-
tion in longitudinal analyses.
Conclusions
Our study emphasizes the importance of improving the moni-
toring and treatment of PTSD over the long term. The impair-
ment in role functioning, mobility, cognition, and social func-
tioning reflects diminished quality of life for older Americans
withpre­late-lifePTSD,particularlyPTSDthatpersistsintolater
life. Considering the projected expansion of the elderly popu-
lation, increased life expectancy, and the health and eco-
nomic costs of mental health disorders, the potential public
health burden of PTSD implicated by this study is concern-
ing. Thus, future studies are needed to identify the reasons un-
derlying PTSD's effect on disability and to investigate better
interventions that will reduce the risk of impairment.
