Abstract
Objective: To describe the characteristics of the perforator vessel in the peroneal artery of the
lower leg and to explore the use of perforator pedicle propeller flaps to repair soft tissue defects in
the lower leg, heel and foot.
Methods: This retrospective study enrolled patients with soft tissue defects of the distal lower leg,
heel and foot who underwent surgery using peroneal perforator-based propeller flaps. The
peroneal artery perforators were identified preoperatively by colour duplex Doppler ultrasound.
The flap was designed based on the preoperatively-identified perforator location, with the
posterior border of the fibula employed as an axis, and the perforator vessel as the pivot point of
rotation. Patients were followed-up to determine the outcomes.
Results: The study analysed 36 patients (mean age, 39.7 years). The majority of the soft tissue
defects were on the heel (20; 55.6%). The donor-site of the flap was closed in 11 patients by direct
suturing and skin grafting was undertaken in 25 patients. Postoperative complications included
venous congestion (nine patients), which was managed with delayed wound coverage and bleeding
therapy. All wounds were eventually cured and the flaps were cosmetically acceptable.
Conclusions: The peroneal perforator pedicle propeller flap is an appropriate choice to repair
soft tissue defects of the distal limbs.

Introduction
Soft tissue reconstruction still presents chal-
lenges to modern day medicine.1­5 The limi-
tation often arises from the availability of
overlying skin at the lower leg after trauma,
thus a free flap is often recommended to
repair the wound, but this is extremely time
consuming and requires years of training and
experience. Nevertheless, extraction and
reconstruction based on perforator flaps has
provided the next step in reconstructive sur-
gery with improved understanding of the
vascular anatomy and cutaneous
circulation.6­9
According to the Gent consensus,10 per-
forator flaps comprise of skin and subcuta-
neous fat that are provided with nutrition by
perforators rising from deep vascular
arteries embedded in the muscle and intra-
muscular septa. Because of the anatomical
characteristics of `skin and bone' in the
lower leg, soft tissue defects are manifested
due to trauma and surgery, and the resulting
deep tendon and bone exposure all need flap
repair. Muscle tissues in the upper leg are
very abundant, more supple, and not easily
damaged. Therefore, the application of per-
forator flaps or neurocutaneous vascular
flap transposition can enable repair of a
soft tissue defect wound in one-third of the
lower leg, foot and ankle. With further
studies, some researchers proposed the con-
cept of propeller flaps.11­13 Because the tex-
ture of these flaps is similar to the recipient
site, in addition to their good appearance and
their ability to partially or completely repair
the donor-site, their application has become
widely adopted.4,11,14­18 However, as with all
pedicle flaps, venous congestion is still the
major postoperative complication and the
primary cause of flap necrosis.19,20 Ever
since the propeller flap concept was proposed
in the 1990s for skin tissue reconstruction of
the body,21 it has gained popularity in the
reconstruction of lower extremities due to its
high flexibility and versatility. The propeller
flap pertaining to the peroneal artery enables
an initial incision from either the medial or
lateral side, and a reliable perforator can be
designed just by visual inspection.22­24 In
addition, modification of the flap can be
easily facilitated based on a perforator being
chosen (one perforator is sufficient as it is able
to provide an effective supply of blood to the
entire flap). On the contrary, more perforators
hinder rotation and may even result in the
kinking of blood vessels.
Various issues have been raised on the use
of perforator pedicle propeller flaps for soft
tissue reconstruction, such as the challenge
faced by soft tissue reconstruction, the advan-
tages of this technique, anatomical and
physiological details of perforator-based pro-
peller flaps, as well as venous congestion of
the flap.4,11,21 This current report aims to
illustrate some of the surgical success that has
been achieved at our institution based on the
understanding of these concepts. Perforator
pedicle propeller flaps can be surgically
implemented for various medical conditions
that urgently require skin tissue reconstruc-
tion.12­15 Using observations in clinical prac-
tice, this current report describes the
characteristics of the perforator vessel in the
peroneal artery of the lower leg and explores
the methods used to reduce the postoperative
complication of inverse venous flow.

Surgical procedures for peroneal artery
perforator-based propeller flaps
Anatomical definitions. Dissection causes the
peroneal artery perforator-based flap to be
easily raised, so that it can be used as a
propeller flap.16 Such a flap is a local island
fasciocutaneous flap arising from a dissected
perforator. Here, the retrieved skin of the
proximal leg may be used for surgical
reconstruction at the regions of the distal
lower extremity, based on a 180 perforator-
based propeller flap for a reliable coverage
of the soft tissue defect. This surgical process
is illustrated in a Figure 1.
The surgical procedure. Typically, the peroneal
artery perforator-based propeller flaps can
be identified preoperatively by colour duplex
Doppler ultrasound scanning and are
located along the lateral aspect of the
lower leg from the lateral malleolus
(Figure 2a, Figure 3 ­ step 1). The next
step is to plan the shape and size of the
propeller flap near regions of the major
perforator proximal to the defect. The lon-
gitudinal length of the flap is the distance
between the perforator nearest to the defect
region added to the longitudinal length of
the defect (Figure 2b, Figure 3 ­ step 2).
Based on the defect location, an option of
either an anterior or posterior incision is
made. The surgical incision can be executed
from one side to ensure that the major
perforator is well nourished (Figure 2c,
Figure 3 ­ step 3). If the position of the
real perforator is different from what was
identified by the preoperative Doppler ultra-
sound scan, the size of the flap is adjusted
appropriately according to the real position
of the perforator vessel (Figure 2d, Figure 3
­ step 4).
The perforator-based propeller flap
varies in shape and size, depending on the
limiting spatial constraint of the perforator
and on the defect region. As demonstrated
in Figure 2e and Figure 3 ­ step 5, the skin is
Figure 1. Schematic diagram illustrating the sur-
gical procedure for peroneal artery perforator-
based propeller flap isolation. Dissection of the
perforator enables rotation and allows sufficient
mobility so that a fasciocutaneous flap can be
isolated and is then rotated 180 like a `propeller'.
The opened section caused by the rotated flap being
moved away from its point of origin is then closed
with direct suturing or skin grafting. (A) The

surgically extracted from the proximal sec-
tion of the lateral leg by having the major
perforator as the pivot. The perforator is
dissected to facilitate rotation and mobility,
so that an isolated and mobilized fasciocu-
taneous flap can be formed and then rotated
180 (Figure 2f, Figure 3 ­ step 6); this is
what makes it to a `propeller', and hence it

turns to fit the defect (Figure 3 ­ step 7). The
opened donor-site area due to the rotation
of the flap can then be skin grafted to close
it, as shown by the lighter patch of skin
(Figure 2g), or it can be sutured directly.
In summary, the details of the surgical
procedures are described as follows: (i) step
1: the colour duplex Doppler ultrasound was
used to examine and mark the position of
the peroneal perforator, in order to design
the flap before surgery; (ii) step 2: the flap
was designed based on the perforator place
examined prior to surgery, with the poster-
ior border of the fibula employed as an axis,

and the perforator vessel adopted as an axis
point of rotation. The big propeller is prox-
imal to the axis point. The length of the big
propeller is 0.5­1 cm longer than the dis-
tance from the pivot point to the distal point
of the wound. The small propeller is the area
from axis point to the defect. The width of
flap is 1­2 cm larger than the defect, and the
thickness of the subcutaneous fat determines
this size difference; (iii) step 3: the anterior
edge of the flap was dissected according to
the preoperative design. Then, the dissection
was performed at a site further from the
lower part of the deep fascia to the inter-
muscular septum in the rear of the peroneus
longus and brevis; thereby, the peroneal
perforator was dissected; (iv) step 4: the
size of flap was appropriately adjusted
according to the real position of the perfor-
ator vessel; (v) step 5: after fulfilling the flap
harvesting, the perforator vessel was dis-
sected to the main part of the peroneal
artery, so as to increase the length of the
vascular pedicle. The fascia tissues of the
intermuscular septum around the vascular
pedicle were also carefully removed to
decrease the venous drainage obstacle
caused by the compression of the vascular
pedicle after rotation; (vi) step 6: the condi-
tions of the vascular pedicle were observed
after its twisting and compression due to the
180 rotation; (vii) step 7: the flap was
sutured to the wound after the rotation if
the blood circulation was good, and the
donor-site of the flap was sutured directly.
Free-skin-grafting could be carried out to
repair the donor-site in the case of the failure
of direct suturing. Two weeks after the
operation, the flaps had completely survived
and the wound was healed. If the venous
return was bad after the rotation, which
indicates that the capillary hyperaemia reac-
tion was quicker than normal, then the
wound coverage was delayed. Delayed
coverage meant that the flap was rotated
and covered the wound, but the wound was
not sutured around the pedicle of the flap;
and 3­5 days later, when the flap swelling
was reduced, delayed suturing was under-
taken around the pedicle of the flap.
If the flap had venous congestion when
the patient came back from the ward, then
`bleeding therapy' was used to manage it.
This involved cutting small incisions
(approximately 5 mm in size) at the periph-
eral area of the flap and bleeding from these
incisions was maintained using heparin
saline (25 U/ml). Careful monitoring was
undertaken to prevent excessive blood loss.
During follow-up, the flap and donor-
sites were checked by the physicians and the
patients were asked their views on the
appearance of both sites.
Statistical analyses
Limited descriptive statistical analyses were
performed using the SPSSÕ statistical pack-
age, version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) for WindowsÕ and data are presented
as mean Æ SD.
Results
From June of 2011 to June of 2013, 36
patients with soft tissue defects of the distal
lower leg, heel and foot were successfully
treated using peroneal perforator-based pro-
peller flaps. None of the patients had dia-
betes mellitus or vascular disease. The
demographic and clinical data for each
patient are presented in Table 1. There
were 29 men (80.6%) and seven women
(19.4%), with a mean Æ SD age of
39.7 Æ 20.3 years (range, 6­83 years). The
majority of the soft tissue defects were on
the heel (20 of 36, 55.6%); with seven on the
ankle (19.4%), five on the distal lower leg
(13.9%), and four on the dorsal foot
(11.1%). The size of the soft tissue defects
ranged from 4 Â 2 cm to 20 Â 6 cm. The
reason for the soft tissue defect was trauma
in all patients. The sizes of the flaps ranged
from 10 Â 5 cm to 34 Â 18 cm.

The donor-site of the flap was closed by
direct suturing in 11 of 36 patients (30.6%)
and skin grafted in 25 of 36 patients (69.4%)
(Table 1). All of the wounds were eventually
cured. As the appearance of these flaps was
similar to the tissues around the wounds and
there were no `dog ears' at the pedicles of the
flaps, the flaps were considered to be cos-
metically acceptable by both the patients
and doctors. The mean Æ SD distance
between the perforator vessels of the flaps
and the lateral malleolus was 10.1 Æ 2.8 cm
(range, 6­18 cm), and 24 patients had per-
forators that were 8.0 Æ 2.0 cm from the
lateral malleolus. Complications included
venous congestion (nine patients), haemato-
cele (one patient), infection (one patient),
and skin grafting necrosis at the donor-site
(one patient). The flaps in seven of the nine
patients with venous congestion survived,
but two patients had necrosis at the distal
site requiring debridement and skin grafting.
The methods used to treat the venous con-
gestion included delaying the wound cover-
age in the three patients in whom the flap
survived and bleeding therapy in five
patients, of which two patients developed
necrosis. One of the nine patients had slight
venous congestion and the flap survived
without any further processing.
Discussion
There are a number of important issues to
consider when implementing perforator-
based propeller flaps for soft tissue defect
repair of the lower limbs. When the soft
tissue defect in the leg is so severe that it has
exposed the internal tendons or bone struc-
tures, the situation is complicated and
requires more surgical planning than with
the repair of less severe soft tissue defects. As
a result of the limited local cutaneous and
muscle flaps available for grafting around
the ankle, the preferred option is to have
tissue transfer from the middle and upper leg
area. The perforator-based propeller flap is
comparable to a local flap in terms of the
amount and firmness of the subcutaneous
tissue, skin texture, and the possibility of
reconstructing `like with like'. Similar to a
local perforator flap, it is characterized by
freedom of choice of skin island shape and
dimension, and safety of perfusion. Using a
free flap might be a more common proced-
ure, but it is well known that the free flap
procedure needs a higher technical level of
surgical expertise and more complex sur-
gery.4,18,25 Compared with a free flap, using
a perforator-based propeller flap requires a
simpler operation and shorter operating
times, and can be performed without the
staff expertise and complex logistical setup.4
The use of a fibula osteoseptocutaneous flap
provides good evidence of how peroneal
artery perforator-based propeller flaps are a
better option for skin harvesting of a larger
area.23,24 Furthermore, perforator-based
propeller flaps offer versatility in terms of
providing different shapes and sizes, and they
can be easily retrieved from other parts of the
body for covering small defects in the lower
leg.21,24 Most importantly, this procedure
ensures blood supply by avoiding the major
blood vessels. In particular, its greater rota-
tion versatility allows an easier distal lower
leg soft tissue reconstruction. Detailed exam-
ination of the perforator-based propeller flap
technique has shown it to be a highly reliable
and the preferred surgical option for treating
soft tissue defects of the lower leg.12­14 It also
provides a good cosmetic postoperative
appearance as shown in Figure 4.
The traditional fasciocutaneous flap
always has a skin bridge at the pedicle.
Keeping the skin bridge at the base of a
peninsular flap may in fact kink the pedicle,
which might compromise the vascular
supply of the flap. This makes flap rotation
difficult and calls for the need to harvest a
bigger flap.26­31 The propeller flap always
needs a skeleton of pedicle vessels, so that it
can rotate freely from 0 to 180. Flap
rotation will work successfully as long as
1082 Journal of International Medical Research 45(3)
the pedicle does not become tight after the
flap rotation.
Alternative local flaps are also used, such
as the distally-based sural flap or the
distally-based peroneus brevis flap.32­34
Wounds that can to be covered by a pero-
neal perforator-based pedicle propeller flap
can also be covered by both the distally-
based sural flap and the distally-based
peroneus brevis flap; and these two flaps
are easier to undertake surgically than the
propeller flap at the pedicles of the flaps.32­34
However, these two types of flaps produce
`dog ears' at the pedicle after flap rotation. It
is evident that the bulky `dog ears' of the
traditional fasciocutaneous flap is visually
unappealing and if the aesthetics of the leg
are poor, then the operation would need to
be performed again, especially if the ankle is
distorted and wearing footwear is not pos-
sible. In this case, cosmetic surgery may also
be necessary. Furthermore, application of
the distally-based sural flap would damage
the nerve, which then leads to sensation
dysfunction.27,28 In contrast, the peroneal
perforator-based pedicle propeller flap does
not damage the nerve.16 In terms of post-
operative complications, such as venous
congestion, haematocele, infection, and
skin grafting necrosis at the donor-site, the
rates of these are similar for the distally-
based sural flap, the distally-based peroneus
brevis flap and the peroneal perforator-
based pedicle propeller flap.16,17,19,20,33,34
There are a number of disadvantages
associated with using perforator-based pro-
peller flaps. Unfortunately, venous conges-
tion cannot be totally avoided during the
propeller flap operation because the walls of
the perforator vessels are more delicate
compared with the perforator arterial wall
and it is difficult to control venous wall

based propeller flaps. These images demonstrate successful recovery and the good cosmetic appearance of
the soft tissue reconstruction in each of these patients. Each of the patients had no issue with wearing socks or
shoes after the operation due to the nicely fitted contours of the flap over the defect. The colour version of

damage after the 180 rotation of the ped-
icle.35 Venous congestion can give rise to
necrosis at the distal flap (Figure 5). After
rotation of the flap, if the pedicle is pulled
tightly it will lead to venous congestion. If
the pedicle is not bared, the deep fascia
around the pedicle will compress the vessels
in the pedicle when the flap is rotated.36
Venous congestion is one of the most diffi-
cult problems to deal with and constitutes
one of the main reasons for flap necro-
sis.19,20 A precise preoperative plan can
reduce the rate of venous congestion.37,38
In this present series of patients, colour
duplex Doppler ultrasound was used pre-
operatively to: (i) determine the position,
diameter and length of the peroneal artery
perforator; and (ii) determine which perfor-
ator would be suitable for the flap. In the
current group of 36 patients, the mean Æ SD
distance between the perforator and lateral
malleolus was 10.1 Æ 2.8 cm (range,
6­18 cm), and 24 patients had perforators
that were 8.0 Æ 2.0 cm from the lateral mal-
leolus. The perforator always had ascending
and descending branches, so that it can
make the flap longer.
The typical length of the flap may range
from approximately 5 to 25 cm and have an
approximate width from 3 to 8 cm. The
perforator flap extraction is mostly
determined by the nature of the soft tissue
defect and is usually around 3 to 25 cm
above the lateral malleolus. However, to
repair a soft tissue defect around the ankle,
it is not practical to use a propeller flap if the
pedicle is far from the wound. The septocu-
taneous vessels from a peroneal artery can
supply a skin island of up to a length and
width of 22­25 cm and 10­14 cm, respect-
ively.30,39 In the current group of 36
patients, the length of the flap ranged from
10 to 34 cm. The pivot point of the peroneal
artery perforator-based flap is preferably
based on the distal perforators, as it can
facilitate a larger section of the proximal
healthy skin to be positioned over the soft
tissue defect.38 The performance of the flap
relies on: (i) the flap length; (ii) the pedicle
size; and (iii) the rotation angle.21
In terms of the method used for pedicle
rotation, the perforator artery is examined
before and after rotation during surgery as
shown in Figure 6. The strain on the blood
vessel is carefully reduced. During the oper-
ation, the surgeon determines the diameter
and number of concomitant veins of the
perforator artery. Usually, there are two
concomitant veins, but sometimes only a
single vein is available. Based on our experi-
ence, if the concomitant vein is single or if its
diameter is narrow, it is better that a

superficial vein of the flap should be micro-
surgically anastomosed to a recipient vein in
order to increase the venous drainage from
the flap. The pedicle should be slack when
flap rotation is performed. It is better to
dissect the pedicle as much as possible,
especially when the rotation angle is more
than 120. A skeleton pedicle may be neces-
sary. It has been demonstrated that the risk
of vessel buckling is decreased when the per-
forator is of 1-mm diameter and the vessel
length is more than 3 cm.35 The direction of
rotation is also very important and it is
crucial to try different directions of rotation
during the operation (i.e. clockwise or
anticlockwise rotation) in order to increase
the slackness of the pedicle.
In this current series of patients, the flap
was sutured in situ, then the tourniquet was
relaxed. The blood circulation of the flap
was then closely observed for 3­5 minutes,
carefully checking for the colour and capil-
lary hyperaemia reaction. If the blood cir-
culation was good, the flap was rotated to
cover the defect. If the blood circulation was
insufficient, a delayed coverage method was
employed, which means that the flap was
rotated to cover the wound, but the wound
was not sutured around the pedicle of the
flap. When the swelling of the flap was
Figure 7. Delaying coverage and suturing of the flap due to venous congestion. (a) If the surgeon finds that
the flap is too tight to suture during the operation, then the flap may not be completely sutured. (b) After 3­5
days, when the swelling of the flap has reduced, the surgeon can complete the suturing and wound coverage.
This helps to avoid the skin tearing. The colour version of this figure is available at: http://imr.sagepub.com.

reduced 3­5 days later, suturing was then
performed (Figure 7).
Another way to rectify the problem of
venous congestion is to massage the flap
from the peripheral margins towards the
centre. If the venous congestion persists, a
few sutures can be loosened at the flap edge
and adequate massaging can be performed
to relieve the venous congestion.24 If the
venous congestion can't be released by
massaging, then bleeding therapy can be
used as follows. Some small incisions
(approximately 5 mm in size) can be made
around the flap to allow continuous bleeding
of the flap. If this method is employed, then
physicians must monitor blood pressure and
heart rate, because in the case of excessive
bleeding, blood transfusion will need to be
given immediately (Figure 8).
In conclusion, the perforator-based pro-
peller flap technique provides a similar tex-
ture of skin as that of the recipient area, a
large range of possible rotation, an easy
operation and a small wound. In addition,
the donor-site of the flap can be closed
directly without influencing the appearance.
Due to the aforementioned advantages
associated with using a peroneal perfora-
tor-based propeller flap, it has been widely
used in clinical practice to repair soft tissue
defects of the lower part of the leg, foot and
ankle. A precondition of using this type of
flap is the ability to preoperatively locate an
appropriate perforator using colour duplex
Doppler ultrasound. If one cannot be
located, then it is more appropriate to use
a distally-based sural flap or a free flap
technique. Locating the precise position of
the perforator preoperatively is one of the
most important issues when planning to use
this type of flap technique and in our
opinion, colour Doppler is the best way to
achieve this. Alternative methods, such as
computed tomography angiogaphy37,40 and
magnetic resonance angiography,41 have
also been suggested to identify the precise
position of the perforator. Venous conges-
tion remains the main complication post-
operatively and proper pedicle processing
and flap design can improve venous conges-
tion. Based on our experience, when venous
congestion occurs after surgery, delaying the
wound coverage and bleeding therapy are
useful methods for controlling it.
