Abstract
Objectives: The 2004 International Conference on Improving Use of Medicines recommended
that emerging and expanding health insurances in low-income countries focus on improving access
to and use of medicines. In recent years, Community-based Health Insurance (CHI) schemes have
multiplied, with mounting evidence of their positive effects on financial protection and resource
mobilization for healthcare in poor settings. Using literature review and qualitative interviews, this
paper investigates whether and how CHI expands access to medicines in low-income countries.
Methods: We used three complementary data collection approaches: (1) analysis of WHO
National Health Accounts (NHA) and available results from the World Health Survey (WHS); (2)
review of peer-reviewed articles published since 2002 and documents posted online by national
insurance programs and international organizations; (3) structured interviews of CHI managers
about key issues related to medicines benefit packages in Lao PDR and Rwanda.
Results: In low-income countries, only two percent of WHS respondents with voluntary insurance
belong to the lowest income quintile, suggesting very low CHI penetration among the poor. Yet
according to the WHS, medicines are the largest reported component of out-of-pocket payments
for healthcare in these countries (median 41.7%) and this proportion is inversely associated with
income quintile. Publications have mentioned over a thousand CHI schemes in 19 low-income
countries, usually without in-depth description of the type, extent, or adequacy of medicines
coverage. Evidence from the literature is scarce about how coverage affects medicines utilization
or how schemes use cost-containment tools like co-payments and formularies. On the other hand,
interviews found that medicines may represent up to 80% of CHI expenditures.
Conclusion: This paper highlights the paucity of evidence about medicines coverage in CHI. Given
the policy commitment to expand CHI in several countries (e.g. Rwanda, Lao PDR) and the
potential of CHI to improve medicines access and use, systematic research is needed on medicine
benefits and their performance, including the impacts of CHI on access to, affordability, and use of
medicines at the household level.

Background
Low-income countries face considerable challenges in
financing health care for their populations: limited tax
revenues and complex management of social health insur-
ance translate into enormously inadequate health expen-
ditures per capita with individuals directly absorbing the
financial burden of diseases.
Over the past decade, policy makers have presented com-
munity financing as an alternative to user fees strategies
and a viable option to improving health care systems in
low-income countries [1,2]. Several typologies reflect the
extreme diversity of community financing, including
community cost-sharing, community prepayment, pro-
vider based health insurance, and government or social
insurance-supported community-driven schemes [3]. The
term 'Community-based Health Insurance' (CHI)
describes not-for-profit prepayment plans for health care,
with community control and voluntary membership that
provide risk pooling to low-income populations: these
nonprofit (mutual) insurance plans are 'any scheme man-
aged and operated by an organization, other than a government
or private for-profit company that provides risk pooling to cover
all or part of the costs of health care services' [4]. The actual
CHI contribution to health care financing is difficult to
quantify. The ability of CHI to improve financial protec-
tion and resource mobilization for health care in poor set-
tings has long been questioned [5,6], but there is now
mounting evidence that CHI has positive effects [2-4,7-
10]. Objectives, structure, size, and management of CHI
plans depend upon local economic and cultural environ-
ments. In recent years, CHI plans have multiplied as a
transition towards better social protection against the cost
of illness in low-income countries where rural popula-
tions are usually excluded from other forms of health
insurance [11-13]. In countries such as Rwanda [14], Sen-
egal [15], or Lao PDR [16], CHI expansion is an integral
component of the national health care financing strategy.
Essential medicines are critical to treating infectious dis-
eases and chronic conditions. Improving access to medi-
cines in developing countries is one key to achieving the
Millennium Development Goals [1,17,18]. In high-
income countries, health insurers have developed strate-
gies that improve affordability of medicines to their mem-
bers (purchasing pools, rebates) and increase their
appropriate utilization (education of consumers and pre-
scribers) [19]. Conversely, the absence of effective medi-
cines coverage may contribute to the incidence of
catastrophic health expenditures [20,21]. Expanding
health insurance to improve access to medicines in poor
regions of the world is one of the recommendations
issued by the 2004 International Conference on Improv-
ing Use of Medicines [22]. There, experts from 70 coun-
tries recommended expanding health insurance programs
to include medicines coverage as a means to improve
access to and use of medicines in low-income countries
and avoid catastrophic household health care expendi-
tures for the world's poor.
We believe that CHI has the potential to improve access to
and quality use of medicines, and that members may be
more likely to voluntarily participate in CHI with medi-
cines coverage. To begin to examine this hypothesis, we
sought to describe the prevalence of CHI among poor
populations; the characteristics of medicine benefits
offered by CHI plans; and how medicines coverage may
affect the performance of CHI and the satisfaction of
members with their plans.
Methods
To control for the diversity of CHI, we focused our inves-
tigation on low-income countries as defined by the World
Bank, e.g. countries with a Gross National Income of
US$875 or less per capita in 2005 [23]. We used data from
National Health Accounts (NHA) to evaluate the preva-
lence of voluntary insurance in health care financing [24].
Because NHA provide only indirect data on CHI, we com-
plemented NHA data with aggregate results from the
WHO World Health Survey (WHS), available for 20 of the
54 low-income countries at the time of our study: Bangla-
desh, Burkina Faso, Chad, Comoros, Côte d'Ivoire, Ethio-
pia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Lao PDR, Malawi, Mali,
Mauritania, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Senegal, Vietnam,
Zambia, and Zimbabwe [25]. Information on out-of-
pocket medicine expenditures and voluntary health insur-
ance coverage was extracted from aggregate WHS reports
[26].
We performed a literature review looking for data on char-
acteristics of medicines coverage offered by CHI plans in
low-income countries. Publications were identified with
EMBASE and MEDLINE from January 2002 through
December 2006, using the search terms: community-
based health insurance, community health planning, cost
sharing, developing countries, drug benefit, fees and
charges, health expenditures, health insurance, health
resources, health services accessibility, insurance, and
medicines coverage. We also searched websites of major
international organizations such as the International
Labor Organization, World Bank, World Health Organi-
zation, and websites of international development agen-
cies such as the US Agency of International Development
and the Agence Française de Développement. Peer-reviewed
articles in English and published reports in English or
French that identified a CHI plan were selected and classi-
fied by country. For each low-income country, we
extracted data on the number of schemes, total member-
ship, as well as existence and role of CHI networks. At the
individual plan level, we collected information about
Health Research Policy and Systems 2008, 6:11 http://www.health-policy-systems.com/content/6/1/11

technical design features related to medicine benefits (i.e.,
inpatient or outpatient medicines coverage, policies
related to use of essential medicines and generics, drug
subsidies and donations channeled through plans),
organizational incentives related to medicines (i.e., men-
tion of cost-containment tools such as medicine co-pay-
ments, strategies for improving quality of prescriptions),
or any mention of members' attitudes about how CHI
affects access to medicines. When two articles provided
the same level of technical information on a scheme, we
chose the more recent one.
Finally, to illustrate how individual plans operate, we con-
ducted interviews using a structured questionnaire in two
countries where governments have taken the lead in using
CHI to expand health insurance coverage to poor popula-
tions: one country in Africa (Rwanda) and one in Asia
(Lao PDR). This questionnaire is available at http://
www.whoccpp.org/research/medic.asp.
Results
Medicine Expenditures, Poverty, and Voluntary Insurance
Over a third of the world's population resides in low-
income countries, where about 70% of people live in rural
areas.
According to NHA data (Table 1), out-of-pocket payments
account for 85% of private health care expenditures,
which themselves represent over half of total health care
expenditures in low-income countries. NHA data include
information on the existence of prepaid health insurance
plans, defined as "the outlays of private social insurance
schemes, commercial and nonprofit (mutual) insurance
schemes, health maintenance organizations, and other agents
managing prepaid medical and paramedical benefits including
the operating costs of these schemes". Overall, private health
care expenditures adjusted for purchasing power parity
(ppp) are similar between low-income countries with and
without private prepaid plans (ppp-adjusted US $ 36.1 vs.
US $ 38.4, respectively). However, in the former, out-of-
pocket expenditures constitute a smaller percentage of pri-
vate health expenditures (78.4% vs. 89.6%), likely due in
part to the 5.3% average contribution by private prepaid
plans.
NHA do not report on categories of population covered by
prepaid health insurance plans, but WHS data give some
indication about the economic status of privately insured
people. WHS data provide information on the overall
prevalence of health insurance, and of "voluntary insur-
ance" which includes CHI. Among the 84,135 households
interviewed by the WHS in the 17 low-income countries
that reported data on the WHS insurance section, a total
of 785 respondents reported having some form of health
insurance (Table 2). Of those respondents reporting
insurance, 61.4% on average were enrolled in voluntary
health insurance programs, ranging from 0.8% of insured
persons in Pakistan to 90.7% of those insured in Nepal.
Coverage by voluntary health insurance was strongly asso-
ciated with income level: on average, 2% of respondents
with voluntary insurance were in the lowest income quin-
tile, while over two-thirds of the insured were in the high-
est.
WHS data from low-income countries provide some
insight about the importance of medicines in household
expenditures, and on how economic factors affect access
to medicines (Table 3). Medicines constitute the largest
reported component of out-of-pocket payments for health
care (median: 41.7%; 25%ile, 75%ile: 31.4%, 47.7%),
ranging from 11.1% of health expenditures in Chad to
68.8% in Nepal. Furthermore, the proportion of out-of-
pocket health expenditures devoted to medicines is
inversely associated with income quintiles (Figure 1).
Those living below the World Bank poverty standard of
US$1 per day devote 53.0% of their health expenditures
to medicines, compared to 40.1% among those living
above the poverty standard (p < 0.01).
Paucity of published data about medicines coverage in
CHI
We identified fifty-three publications containing informa-
tion about 1066 CHI plans in 19 low-income countries
[10-12,16,27-75]. Table 4 summarizes the number of CHI

plans identified and populations covered. Apart from evi-
dence of diversity in size ­ from seven members in the
Khasoko CHI of Kenya [49], to over one million in the
Student's Health Home scheme of West Bengal, India [31]
­ information about individual plans was scarce. Most
data were aggregated from either national CHI networks
in Lao PDR [16,63] and Rwanda [27,70,71], or from net-
works affiliated with non-governmental organizations
such as La Concertation [73], or Community Health
Financing for Eastern Africa (CHeFA-EA) [46,48,49,68].
We found data linking individual schemes to the existence
of a medicines benefit package for only 20 schemes: 13
from India, 3 from Bangladesh, 3 from Senegal, and 1
from Benin. Table 5 shows that some form of medicines
coverage was documented in 36% of the publications, a
medicines co-payment in 32%, outpatient medicine ben-
efits in 25%, an essential medicines list (EML) or generic
medicine policies in 21% of the publications. No publica-
tion reported the details of medicines benefit packages or
how members qualify for coverage; none provided evi-
dence about expanded access to medicines linked with
medicines coverage.
Two illustrative case studies
In Rwanda, a comprehensive political and legal frame-
work supports the systematic expansion of CHI as the
instrument of progression towards universal health insur-
ance coverage [14,76]. Consequently, the number of
schemes has rapidly grown in recent years to over 300 in
2006, the highest number of schemes and enrollees in
low-income countries (Table 4). In 2005, CHI covered
43% of the entire population, up from 9% in 2003. Local
CHI plans and the health centers they support are coordi-
nated by 30 districts. A governmental technical support
unit (CTAMS) oversees district units, determines policies
and practices of CHI, and dictates common features of
benefit packages. Benefits cover low risk events treated at
the health center level, including medicines on the
national Essential Medicines List (EML), all preventive
and curative services, prenatal care, delivery care, labora-
tory exams, and referral transport to district hospitals.
Some selected high-risk events are also covered at the dis-
trict hospital level. External funding has been used to
finance the provision of CHI coverage for the very poor.
Interviews with managers of two schemes: Gicumbi and
Centre Universitaire de Santé Publique (CUSP) illustrate
how CHI functions in Rwanda. These two schemes were
selected because they represent two different geographic
areas (Northern and Southern Provinces) and two levels
of activity (Gicumbi coordinates several plans at the dis-
trict level whereas CUSP assumes a strictly local function).
Both plans had been in operation for over three years at
the time of interviews.
The CUSP plan (Huye district, Southern Province) oper-
ates at the local level. Created in 2003 in a mixed rural/

urban environment, it now insures between 5,000 and
10,000 persons. Membership is voluntary and individual.
Yearly premiums are 1,000 Frw (US$1­2) on average.
Members pay a fixed co-payment of 100 Frw (US$ 0.20)
for every medicine obtained at health centers, and a coin-
surance of 10% of retail price for medicines received in the
hospital. Medicine costs represented 80% of the total
expenditures of CUSP in 2006. The Gicumbi plan, created
in 1999, operates at the district level coordinating 21
plans linked to health centers and 1 plan linked to a hos-
pital, and insuring 85% of the target population. Member-
ship is by family and voluntary, except for the very poor
chosen by the community and automatically enrolled
without paying premiums. Annual premiums average
3,500 Frw (US$ 6­7). Members pay a fixed 10% coinsur-
ance for all medicines. Outpatient benefits only include
medicines on the national EML and prescribed by health
centers; some medicines not on the EML are covered by
the inpatient benefit. At the district level, the Gicumbi dis-
trict/regional authority buys medicines from the Rwanda
central pharmacy (CAMERWA) at average wholesale price
plus 5% margin and sets retail prices. Medicines expendi-
tures of the Gicumbi plan increased by a factor of five after
implementation of the Ministry of Health decision to
cover the very poor, suggesting a broader access to both
care and medicines by these populations. Most frequently
used medicines are amoxycillin, paracetamol, quinine,
cotrimozaxole, and penicillin V.
According to the interviews, Gicumbi's policy of familial
membership and free-of-charge enrollment of some of the
poorest in the community indicates an emphasis on
equity in access of care. Its outpatient drug coverage
restrictions suggest an effort to control the quantity and
appropriateness of medicines used that may be beneficial
to its long-term financial sustainability. On the other
hand, CUSP's policy of individual membership for every-
one without subsidy may be less oriented towards equity.
Its strategy of fixed co-payment for every medicine
obtained at the health center without coverage restrictions
may target over utilization without trying to influence the
choice of medicines.
Like Rwanda authorities, those of Lao PDR have adopted
a national strategy to increase health resource mobiliza-
tion for the poor. In April 2005, regulations for a nation-
wide implementation of community based health
insurance were issued after three pilot CHI projects
showed promising results [16]. However, interviews con-
firmed that the current expansion is still at a very early

stage. By late 2006, a total of 3,368 families were enrolled
in five CHI schemes. Regulations seem to leave little
autonomy to communities in day-to-day operations.
Regardless of schemes, CHI membership is voluntary.
Family premiums are set by the government (average US$
2.5­3.0 per family per month), and differ between urban
and rural areas. Members receive medicines free of charge
as long as these are on the national EML. District hospi-
tals, which are the primary point of care, receive monthly
capitation payments from CHI plans for enrollees, and
have to report every month to a district management com-
mittee on utilization and drug consumption. In one
scheme, medicine costs in 2006 amounted to five million
kip/month (about US$ 500), representing 62.5% of its
total expenditures. Plans have not extended coverage to
the very poor yet. One interviewed official noted a high
demand for care among CHI members, who tend to
expect premiums to be paid back in form of services. The
voluntary nature of membership was identified as a chal-
lenge, because it leads members to leave schemes when
they do not have enough money to pay premiums, are dis-
satisfied with the quality of services provided, or perceive
no need for care.
Discussion
We combined three complementary sources of data to
explore CHI medicines coverage in low-income countries.
Our findings highlight the paucity of evidence about med-

icines coverage and medicines utilization in community-
based health insurance programs, as well as the need for
understanding better the role of medicines coverage in the
overall health care financing strategy of low-income coun-
tries. Several factors make systematic analysis of data
about the structure and processes of CHI plans particu-
larly challenging: small size, diversity of communities
where they function, and lack of infrastructure or techni-
cal capacity. Indeed, most available data come from
schemes currently receiving assistance from governments,
large micro-insurance networks, or international organi-
zations[71,77] A plausible explanation could be that the
focus to date has been on strategic expansion and political
acceptance of CHI rather than on CHI performance. The

scaling up of CHI plans is gaining momentum in several
countries, and more systematic data may become availa-
ble. It will then be possible to collect and analyze data on
the availability and performance of medicines benefits
with the objective of improving the effectiveness of CHI
plans.
The paucity of data may also reflect the fact that many CHI
plans operate in environments where drug supply systems
are so weak that covering medicines is not a realistic
option. Nevertheless, as WHS data demonstrate, pay-
ments for medicines constitute about half of out-of-
pocket expenditures in low-income countries, and this
proportion increases with poverty. Even in settings where
medicines supply may not be adequate, poor people still
use a substantial portion of their meager resources to buy
medicines.
Overall, our findings confirm that voluntary insurance,
which includes CHI, has a very low penetration in low-
income countries where private payments, representing
over half of health care expenditures, are mostly made of
out-of-pocket. Our literature review identified CHI plans
in only one-third of low-income countries (19/54); in
only four countries did the plans cover more than 1% of
the population. Reasons may vary with national contexts.
For instance in Vietnam, the recent emphasis by the Social
Security Agency on extending social health insurance cov-
erage to poor populations is consistent with the relatively
high percentage of voluntarily insured Vietnamese in the
lowest income bracket (11.1%), and may explain why
CHI has not been the focus of attention in this country in
recent years [78-81]. WHS data in several countries as well
as interviews with CHI officials in Lao PDR and Rwanda
show that CHI plans experience substantial difficulties in
reaching poor people: only 2% of WHS respondents
enrolled in voluntary insurance belong to the lowest
income bracket. This, and the fact that we were unable to
identify CHI schemes in two-third of low income coun-
tries, indicate that at present CHI reaches a minute pro-
portion of the underprivileged [12,73].
The raison d'être of CHI is to improve access to care for the
poorest of the society. With low penetration among the
poor, CHI does not yet achieve this goal. We believe that
a focus on inpatient and outpatient medicines coverage,
adjusted to local circumstances, may be one strategy to
encourage higher rates of voluntary enrollment in CHI by
the poor. CHI plans which cover medicines can devise
strategies to ensure that quality medicines are consistently
available at health centers, provide incentives (such as
lower copayments) to use generics, and encourage appro-
priate prescribing through education and administrative
systems. A key challenge will be to ensure financial sus-
tainability of the CHI plans as enrollment and demand for
medicines increase.
To be successful, CHI must perform well in two areas: rev-
enue collection and strategic purchasing [8]. Medicines
coverage policies have an important influence on both.
Low voluntary enrollment is a major obstacle to scaling
up CHI. Studies have shown that perceptions about qual-
ity of care affect CHI membership: coverage for and avail-
ability of medicines may be a key determinant of these
perceptions [57,77,82]. For example, some schemes
explicitly exclude expensive antiretroviral or tuberculosis
medicines from their benefits [11], or sell low-cost drugs
at up to seven times the international retail price to
recover other costs [27]. Such coverage and pricing poli-
cies may deter enrollment, and work against effective per-
formance. CHI plans can also boost direct revenues by
channeling subsidies from public authorities and interna-
tional donors, which seems to be the case in Rwanda. This
approach has the potential to increase the ratio of prepaid
contributions to health care costs, an indicator of finan-
cial protection; and to improve the financial stability of
plans, allowing them to play a more active role in support-
ing premiums of the poorest, thereby reaching greater
equity in access to medicines, another key performance
domain for CHI [8].
Financial access to medicines can be expanded by inte-
grating evidence about effectiveness, preferences of pro-
viders, and medical needs of members in decisions about
which medicines to cover, negotiating affordable prices
with providers, and working with local medicines outlets
to ensure availability of medicines. The potential of CHI
to influence prescription behavior and to control medi-
cine costs is real. Even if they do not purchase medicines
directly, CHI plans can negotiate payments with those
who purchase and supply medicines, and they can design
incentives to use recommended medicines. In Benin, the
Association d'Entraide des Femmes scheme preferentially
contracts with religious health care providers, because
these providers receive donations of brand name medi-
cines that patients prefer, and sell them at discounted
prices [61]. While this policy may be rational in achieving
reliable supply and low prices in the short-term, the com-
mitment to brand name rather than generic medicines
and reliance on donations may be uneconomical and
unsustainable as a long-term strategy.
From our review, it is clear that appropriate tools to assist
in designing and managing medicines benefit packages
adapted to low-income environments do not exist yet,
despite the multiplicity of workshops and manuals target-
ing CHI administrators [83,84]. Training CHI managers to
analyze dispensing data in order to better understand and
manage medicines utilization, as is done in high-income
Health Research Policy and Systems 2008, 6:11 http://www.health-policy-systems.com/content/6/1/11

(page number not for citation purposes)
countries, should be a high priority. CHI managers can
play a critical role if they are aware of medical needs of
their members, are familiar with local care seeking and
prescribing patterns, and understand local drug pricing
and supply management issues. For example, incentives
to prescribe and use generics may help to shift market
share away from commonly used brand medicines, exert
pressure to reduce the prices of these brand products, and
increase treatment affordability for both CHI plans and
patients.
The paucity of medicines coverage data prevented us from
examining the role of CHI on improving access to medi-
cines. Yet, interviews suggest that medicines represent
between 65% and 80% of costs incurred by some plans,
highlighting the importance of monitoring medicines uti-
lization and expenditures in CHI. Medicines coverage pol-
icies can be used to control medicine expenditures and to
improve quality use by rewarding adequate prescription
behavior and by encouraging the use of effective and safe
medicines at lowest possible prices. In poor communities,
CHI provides a critical institutional link between patients,
providers, and suppliers of medicines: it can play a key
role by negotiating with medicine suppliers, by adjusting
medicines coverage to local health care priorities, by dis-
seminating education materials tailored to the commu-
nity about quality use of medicines, by linking medicines
coverage to treatment adherence, and by rewarding pro-
viders and community-based workers who follow treat-
ment guidelines. In this context, the large-scale social
experiment of CHI development in Rwanda is of signifi-
cance, since it may bring important progress to the under-
standing of challenges faced by CHI in low-income
settings. Interviews with CHI administrators in Rwanda
illustrate the interplay of government support and com-
munity involvement needed to design medicine benefits
for the poor. Much more could be learned in this setting
by comparing membership and utilization among plans
with different medicine benefits, and by exploring the
relationship between medicines coverage and enrollment,
cost recovery, and financial stability.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our results show that the extent and nature
of medicines coverage offered by CHI in low-income
countries are not well-reported at this time. Lack of access
to medicines is a crucial issue in the developing world. We
believe that better medicines coverage and well-designed
medicine benefits are part of a strategy to address this
problem. Further research is needed to characterize cur-
rent coverage and utilization of essential medicines in
CHI, to identify effective medicines benefit packages in
low-income settings, and to study the impacts of these
benefits on patterns of service utilization and clinical out-
comes. A better understanding of medicine policies in
CHI can help national policymakers and insurers who
develop strategies to improve health care financing sys-
tems, prevent catastrophic health expenditures, and
achieve the Millennium Development Goals. To that
effect, the Rwanda experience may constitute a unique
opportunity to evaluate the contribution of CHI in
improving access of medicines, medicines utilization, and
ultimately health outcomes in low-income environments.
