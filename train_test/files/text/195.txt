Disentangling the Disablement Process

A model was proposed to assess the premise thatfunctional limitations are an intermediary stage between risk factors
(e.g., sex andfrequency of walking a mile), pathology/impairments (e.g., musculoskeletal problems), and the onset
and course of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) disability. Analyses were based on two random
subsamples (each with n = 524) of Longitudinal Study ofAging respondents who were nondisabled at baseline (1984)
and reinterviewed in 1988 and 1990. The model's central premise was supported in two ways. The main influence of
age, frequency of walking, and musculoskeletal problems was on the onset offunctional limitations, rather than the
onset of IADL disability. And, onset of lower bodyfunctional limitations influencedfuture disability (1990) through its
relationship with disability in 1988 andfunctional limitations in 1990. The results underscore the value of clinical
trials which focus on minimizingfunctional limitations as a strategyfor preventing disability.
AN important focus of gerontological research has been
L the transition from health to disability. Several models
of the transition have been proposed, and a common theme
postulates functional limitations (limitations in the perfor-
mance of basic tasks considered normal) as the pathway
from illness to disability (Boult et al., 1994; Committee on
Disability cited in Richardson, 1994; Johnson and Wo-
linsky, 1993; Nagi, 1976; Verbrugge and Jette, 1994; World
Health Organization, 1980). Longitudinal research has been
critical in capturing the dynamic aspects of the transition and
in helping to define and refine the intermediate stage of
functional limitations in the disablement process (e.g.,
Avlund, Davidsen, and Schultz-Larsen, 1995; Bowling,
Farquhar, and Grundy, 1994; Crimmins and Saito, 1993;
Guralnik and Kaplan, 1989; Harris et al., 1989; Hughes et
al., 1994;Moretal., 1989).
Although valuable for establishing basic associations, the
previous research does not allow a full understanding of the
interrelationships among demographic and behavioral risk
factors, pathology/impairments, functional limitations, and
disability. That is, most previous epidemiologic studies of
disablement have relied on single-equation systems in which
hypothesized causes of disability were simultaneously en-
tered into the model to determine their net direct effects on
disability (Avlund, Davidsen, and Schultz-Larsen, 1995;
Crimmins and Saito, 1993; Guralnik and Kaplan, 1989;
Guralnik et al., 1995; Harris et al., 1989; Jette, Branch, and
Berlin, 1990; Kaplan et al., 1993; Lammi et al., 1989; Mor
et al., 1989, 1994; Pinsky et al., 1985). However, clinical
trials designed to reduce and prevent disability would benefit
from analyses which identify the critical risk factors for the
disablement process, clarify the causal mechanism behind
their impact on disability, and delineate the interplay be-
tween and among functional limitations and disability across
time. To address these issues, the present investigation relies
on a model put forth by Nagi (1965, 1976), and further
expanded by Verbrugge and Jette (1994).
The Disablement Process: The Proposed Model
Consistent with Nagi (1965, 1976, 1991), the Committee
on a National Agenda for the Prevention of Disabilities
(Pope and Tarlov, 1991; Richardson, 1994), and Verbrugge
and Jette (1994), the main pathway in the disablement
process is as follows: pathology (presence of disease) leads
to impairments (anatomic and structural abnormalities),
which in turn lead to functional limitations (restrictions in
basic physical and mental actions), which then lead to
disability (difficulty doing activities of daily life). Figure 1
models the main pathway along with major risk factors that
modify the pathway. The progression of steps leading to
physical disability is reflected in the direction of the causal
linkages and in the time of measurement selections. Pathol-
ogy and impairments are grouped as one stage because of the
inherent difficulty of separating them in self-report surveys.
The terminology and linkages are developed below. It
should be noted that this scheme is basically consistent with
the World Health Organization's (1980) International Clas-
sification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps
(ICIDH), although the terminology differs. The ICIDH uses
the terms "disability" and "handicap" whereas Nagi, and
Verbrugge and Jette use "functional limitations" and "dis-
ability," respectively, with somewhat different definitions
(Verbrugge and Jette, 1994).
Components of the conceptual model. -- Several risk
factors are thought to be associated with the disablement
process. These factors are usually permanent or long-
standing features of an individual. As such, they exist, or are
in place, before the disablement process begins and are seen
as causes that predispose the individual to chronic and
enduring impacts. Consistent with their predisposing role
and the progression of becoming disabled, risk factors are
represented in the model as primary, both causally and
temporally, by their occupying the farthest left position of
explanatory factors. Their role as temporally primary is also
represented through their being measured in 1984, and
through including only individuals who report no functional
limitations or disabilities in 1984. For this subset of elderly
persons the order of occurrence is clear and will permit a
better sense of the progression (Branch, 1985; Guralnik et
al., 1995; Mor et al., 1989). The first panel of Figure 1

includes the relevant risk factors from among those available
for meaningful analysis.
Two types of risk factors are represented. One set includes
those risk factors that are sociodemographic in nature: sex,
age, and education. Unfortunately, it was not possible to
include race/ethnicity because the majority of the sample
was Caucasian (93.6%, with only 5.4% African American
and 1.0% a race/ethnicity other than Caucasian or African
American). The other set includes two risk factors that
reflect life-style and/or behavioral aspects: body mass and
frequency of walking a mile per week. We've included only
one item to measure physical activity, which is a limited
definition. However, that item is simple and relatively
straightforward: it focuses on and requests specific informa-
tion about actual amount of activity in a way that is readily
interpreted by respondents. This is in contrast to other items
which were available in the Longitudinal Study of Aging
(Kovar, Fitti, and Chyba, 1992) but potentially introduced
more bias due to individual interpretations and definitions of
exercise (i.e., Do you feel that you get as much exercise as
you need, or less than you need? Do you follow a regular
routine of physical exercise?).
As represented in Figure 1, the two sets of risk factors are
not seen as independent of each other. Rather, the basic
demographic risk factors are seen as impacting on the life-
style and behavioral risk factors. In turn, both sets are
hypothesized to causally relate to pathology/impairments.
The main pathways for risk factors are through their role
as a cause that prompts pathology/impairments. Thus, the
role played by education in the disablement process is
hypothesized to be through its relationship to body mass,
frequency of walking, and pathology/impairments. How-
ever, because of the importance of sex and age, their direct
and indirect effects (e.g., through their relationship to
pathology/impairments, and functional limitations) on dis-
ablement were evaluated (Rogers, Rogers, and Belanger,
1992). In addition, for well elderly persons, less is known
about the relationships of age and sex to disablement
(Guralnik et al., 1995; Mor et al., 1989). Accordingly, the
model directly links sex and age to all subsequent stages in
the process.
The behavioral and life-style risk factors are depicted as
modifying the main pathway through their relationship to the
onset of pathology/impairments and functional limitations.
This is consistent with previous research which suggests that
body mass and physical activity levels relate to the onset
of disability, regardless of the presence of pathology/
impairments (e.g., Guralnik and Kaplan, 1989; Harris at al.,
1989; Pinsky et al., 1985). Thus, we proposed that body
mass and frequency of walking a mile will have significant
direct and indirect effects (through their relationship to
pathology/impairments) on functional limitations such that
their total impact will play a cumulative and costly role in the
onset of the disablement process.
Pathology/Impairments are abnormalities and dysfunc-
tions of specific body systems and, for the present purposes,
represent pathology which has crossed clinical threshold
and been diagnosed. Associations between pathology/
impairments and disability have been found for several
health conditions (for an excellent review of longitudinal
DISABLEMENT PROCESS S175
findings see Boult et al., 1994), and research suggests that
different conditions may have different impacts on the tran-
sition from physical independence to disability (e.g., Guc-
cione et al., 1994; Guralnik and Kaplan, 1989). We focus on
four types of pathology/impairments which have been iden-
tified in previous research as having an important relation-
ship with disability: diabetes (e.g., Mor et al., 1989), cardio-
vascular diseases (e.g., Boult et al., 1994; Guccione et al.,
1994), musculoskeletal diseases (e.g., Boult at al., 1994;
Hughes et al., 1994; Jette, Branch, and Berlin, 1990), and
vision-related diseases or pathology/impairments (e.g.,
Horowitz, 1994; Rudberg et al., 1993). We hypothesized
that the impact of these conditions is through the intermedi-
ate stage of functional limitations, and thus only indirectly
do they affect disability.
Functional Limitations are restrictions in performing fun-
damental physical activities. Consistent with previous repre-
sentations, these physical actions provide the pathway by
which pathology/impairments and life-style risk factors in-
fluence the individual's abilities to perform physical and
social activities (e.g., instrumental activities of daily living
such as shopping for personal items). Because of the impor-
tant role functional limitations play in the pathway from risk
factors and pathology/impairments to disability, two aspects
are differentiated: restrictions associated with the upper
body (e.g., reaching up) and the lower body (e.g., walking).
Prior work indicates that this distinction is conceptually and
clinically useful (e.g., Jette, Branch, and Berlin, 1990;
Johnson and Wolinsky, 1993). In both 1988 and 1990,
functional limitations are causally linked to disability.
Disability refers to difficulty experienced in carrying out
activities in any domain of life. In general, disability results
from health and physical problems. The model and defini-
tions are applicable to any domain of life, including, for
example, hobbies (Verbrugge and Jette, 1994). For the
purposes of this analysis, we focus on IADL disability
resulting from physical health pathology/impairments and
functional limitations. This domain of daily living focuses
on household management (e.g., preparing meals). It would
have been preferable also to model basic ADLs. However,
the number of difficulties with basic activities of daily living
reported among the nondisabled in 1988 were too few to
model (about 4% reported any difficulties with basic ADLs).
Cross-sectional and longitudinal components of the pro-
cess. -- It should be noted that the risk factors (sociodemo-
graphic and life-style) and the pathology/impairments were
measured at the same time (i.e., 1984). Their true causal
order is not known. Rather, we imposed a causal order that is
consistent with the theoretical underpinnings of the model.
However, the theoretical model also recognizes the role of
feedback mechanisms. Thus, it is important to recognize that
the relationship between pathology/impairments and the risk
factors of body mass and frequency of walking a mile is not
simply a one-way relationship. It is not possible to model
these feedback relationships because direct questions about
physical activity and body mass are not included in the
follow-up interviews.
The causal relationship between functional limitations and
disability warrants clarification. We have represented this
relationship as a causal one in 1988 and in 1990 although the
data for those relationships are cross-sectional. The repre-
sentation is consistent with theory and a central premise of
the model: Functional limitations are a main driving force
behind the downward-spiraling in the disablement process.
For example, an individual may have difficulty walking (a
functional limitation), and yet still be able to shop for
personal items, albeit slowly and painfully (e.g., because
arthritis of the left knee has caused difficulty in walking). As
the arthritis progresses, or other pathologies are experi-
enced, further functional limitations may result such that the
person is no longer able to walk even slowly or painfully,
which can lead to a situation where the person can only shop
with a lot of difficulty, or stops shopping altogether (disabil-
ity). Thus, functional limitations in 1988 impact on disabil-
ity in 1988, both of which impact on functional limitations in
1990, with functional limitations in 1990 hypothesized to be
the main pathway for understanding disability in 1990. By
separating upper and lower body functional limitations, it
was possible to evaluate whether lower body functional
limitations played a more important role in the disablement
process, relative to upper body functional limitations and
prior disability levels. The linkage from 1988 disability to
1990 disability is included to control for prior disability.
The proposed causal order between functional limitations
and disability is further supported by the prevalence rates
across time for functional limitations and IADL disability.
That is, the percent of respondents reporting some difficulty
with functional limitations, especially for lower body func-
tioning, exceeded the percent reporting IADL disabilities.
These percents increased over time, with the percents for
functional limitations remaining larger than those for IADL
disabilities. The overall patterns reinforce the proposed
causal order and suggest that Figure 1 is the most fruitful
avenue for model building, rather than proposing another
causal order between functional limitations and disabilities.
METHOD
Sample and Data
The data came from the Longitudinal Study of Aging
(LSOA) conducted by the National Center for Health Statis-
tics and the National Institute on Aging. The LSOA was a
special six-year follow-up to the 1984 National Health
Interview Survey's Supplement on Aging (SOA). We
provide a brief overview below, and refer the interested
reader to Kovar, Fitti, and Chyba (1992) for more detailed
information.
The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is an an-
nual survey of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of
the United States. It is designed to collect information on
health and health service utilization. The 1994 NHIS in-
cluded a special supplement, the Supplement on Aging
(SOA), which was designed to collect information on the
health, social functioning, and living arrangements of indi-
viduals aged 55 or older. These two surveys constitute the
baseline survey for the LSOA, which was designed to
measure changes in functioning and living arrangements for
a cohort of older Americans. Follow-up interviews were
conducted at two-year intervals (1986, 1988, and 1990), and
S176 LAWRENCE AND JETTE
the sample frame for the LSOA included 7,527 SOA partici-
pants aged 70 years or older. Although a smaller subsample
was interviewed in 1986 because of budget constraints, the
data base for our research is the larger sample of 7,527
participants. For the present analysis, the 1986 interview
was not included to ensure the largest possible number of
eligible respondents and a greater likelihood of disability
transitions for this group of well elderly persons.
This analysis in based on LSOA respondents who in 1984
reported no functional limitations and no disability (defined
below). A similar approach has been used by others and
proven to be very useful for refining our understanding of the
onset of disability (e.g., Branch, 1985; Guralnik and Ka-
plan, 1989;Guralniketal., 1995;Moretal., 1989). Of those
respondents reporting no functional limitations or disabili-
ties (n = 2,738), 1,048 had complete information on the
relevant variables at baseline (i.e., risk factors and
pathology/impairments) and at the 1988 and 1990 follow-up
interviews; they comprise the study sample.
In order to minimize capitalization on chance, the subset
of nondisabled elderly respondents was randomly split into
two subsamples for analysis. Chi-squared tests of signifi-
cance and multivariate analysis of variance tests indicated
that the two groups did not differ significantly with regard to
any of the relevant variables.
About two-thirds (68%) of the respondents in this study
sample were female. The average age was about 74 years
with a range of 70-90 years (74.18, with a standard devia-
tion of 3.73). About one-third of the respondents (36.4%)
were living alone at the time of the baseline survey, and this
percent remained roughly the same at the follow-up inter-
views. The average level of education was about 11 years
(11.20, with a standard deviation of 3.31). Virtually all of
the sample were Caucasian (93.6%).
About 40 percent reported "never" as the frequency of
walking a mile per week (38.7%), with the average response
being "once a week." Most of the elderly respondents were
of normal weight (76.2%), with about 20% being over-
weight (18.2%), and 5.5% underweight. Few elderly per-
sons reported having diabetes (4.5%). About one-fifth re-
ported vision-related problems (21.5%). Roughly 40 percent
reported musculoskeletal problems (39.9%), and about 44
percent reported cardiovascular problems (43.9%).
Measures
Risk factors. -- The demographic risk factors were age
(measured in actual years), sex (0 = female; 1 = male), and
education (actual years for 0-17, with 18 including 6 years
or more of college). Body mass was expressed as self-
reported weight (kilograms) divided by the square of self-
reported height (meters) and measured as under, normal, or
above weight. The normal range for body mass was defined
as 20.7 to 27.8 for males and 19.1 to 27.3 for females
(Thomas, 1993). These ranges, while being consistent with
previous research suggesting that a body mass index of 21 or
less is a risk factor (e.g., Rudberg et al., 1993), also add sex-
specific information.
The physical activity item was frequency of walking a
mile per week, ranging from "never" to "every day" (0 =
never; 1 = less than once a week; 2 = once a week; 3 = 2-
3 times a week; 4 = 4-6 times a week; and 5 = every day).
A variable measuring living arrangements (lives alone vs
lives with spouse or others) was also evaluated as a risk
factor because some studies have found it to be a significant
factor in the disablement process (e.g., Mor et al., 1989).
However, it exhibited no significant bivariate relationship to
any of the functional limitations and disability measures, and
therefore was not included in any further analyses.
The four areas of Pathology/Impairments were measured
as follows: presence of diabetes (0 = no; 1 = yes), number
of cardiovascular problems (stroke; hardening of the arter-
ies; hypertension; rheumatic fever; rheumatic heart disease;
coronary heart disease; angina pectoris; myocardial infarc-
tion; any other heart attack); number of musculoskeletal
problems (osteoporosis; broken hip; arthritis or rheuma-
tism); and number of vision-related problems (cataracts;
glaucoma; detached retina or other condition; blindness in
one or both eyes; trouble seeing even when wearing glasses).
For the Functional Limitation measures, each item was
scored with a value of one representing difficulty performing
the item, and a zero representing no difficulty. Upper body
functional status was the number of items the respondent
reported difficulty performing (i.e., difficulty "using your
fingers to grasp or handle," "reaching up over your head,"
and "reaching out") and could range from 0 to 3. This list is
consistent with Johnson and Wolinsky (1993), except that
we do not include the item assessing difficulty in sitting for
more than two hours. We excluded this item because it was
not part of Nagi's (1976) original set.
Lower body functional status was the total number of
items the respondent reported difficulty performing from
among five items: difficulty "walking a quarter of a mile,"
"walking up 10 steps," "standing or being on your feet for
about two hours," "trouble stooping, crouching, kneel-
ing," and "lifting or carrying something as heavy as 10
pounds." Our definition of lower body functional limita-
tions is consistent with Johnson and Wolinsky (1993), ex-
cept we use lifting 10 pounds instead of 25 pounds. We used
the 10-pound item to be consistent with the work of Nagi
(1976).
Disability. -- For inclusion in the study sample of nondis-
abled elderly persons, at baseline (1984) respondents had to
report "no difficulty" with regard to both instrumental and
basic ADLs, although only instrumental ADLs were incorpo-
rated in the model. The individual items assessing difficulty
performing basic and instrumental ADLs were assigned a
value of zero for no difficulty and one for difficulty. Respon-
dents who did not do an activity for other reasons were
excluded because it was not possible to determine if they were
abled or disabled. Basic ADL items included "bathing,"
"eating," "dressing," and "toileting." Instrumental ADL
disability was measured by the total number of activities done
with difficulty (0 to 5) reported for the following: "shop-
ping," "preparing meals," "managing money," "using the
telephone," and "doing light housework."
Data Analysis Strategy
Structural equation modeling techniques were used to
DISABLEMENT PROCESS S177
evaluate the models (Joreskog and Sorbom, 1989). An
analytic strategy involving two stages was developed to
incorporate the advantages of a replicated design and to
maintain a reasonable ratio of number of respondents to
number of parameters estimated. The first step involved
analyzing a model of the relationships among the baseline
measures prior to analyzing the larger model. This step
identified significant relationships and permitted the trim-
ming of nonsignificant relationships among the risk factors
and pathology/impairments. Linkages which were signifi-
cant for either subsample were included in all further anal-
yses. These linkages are discussed below in the section
on the relationships among risk factors and pathology/
impairments. The second step involved evaluating the pro-
posed model for IADL disability for both subsamples. Eval-
uation included examining significance of the proposed
direct and indirect effects, verifying the hypothesized insig-
nificance of omitted linkages, and verifying the goodness of
fit for the overall model. Determining the significance of the
indirect effects was possible because LISREL provides
standard errors for indirect effects. Evaluating the possible
contributions of the omitted linkages was based on the
modification indices. Thus, it is possible to evaluate the
linkages which are hypothesized not to be significant.
The PRELIS program was used to screen all variables
(Joreskog and Sorbom, 1988). Various options were evalu-
ated for the three variables exhibiting problematic skewness
and kurtosis. Recoding the scale for the lower body func-
tional limitation measure to four levels (i.e., 0, 1,2, and 3 or
more difficulties) eliminated its non-normality and kurtosis
problems. The other two variables (upper body functional
limitation measures and instrumental ADL measures) re-
quired logarithmic transformations to make their distribu-
tions more symmetrical (Bollen, 1989).
RESULTS
For ease of presentation, the results for the proposed
model (Figure 1) were organized around the stages of the
disability process. Thus, separate tables are presented for the
relationships among the risk factors and pathology/
impairments (the baseline measures; Table 1), the relation-
ships between these baseline measures and the onset of upper
and lower functional limitations (the initial stage of transi-
tion; Table 2), and the relationships among the functional
limitation and IADL disability measures (the progression of
disability; Table 3). It is important to emphasize that the
results summarized in Tables 1 through 3 were evaluated
simultaneously (Figure 1). Overall measures of fit for the full
model are summarized at the bottom of Table 3.
Relationships Among the Risk Factors
and Pathology/Impairments
Table 1 summarizes the coefficients for the relationships
between the sociodemographic risk factors (sex, age, and
education) and the behavioral and life-style risk factors
(frequency of walking and body mass) and the pathology/
impairments (diabetes and musculoskeletal) included based
on preliminary analyses. Similarly, Table 1 also summarizes
the linkages between the behavioral and life-style risk fac-
tors (frequency of walking and body mass) and the
pathology/impairments (diabetes, cardiovascular, and vi-
sion) included based on preliminary analyses.
As seen in Table 1, for both subsamples, men reported
walking a mile more frequently than women. Higher levels of
education were associated with less likelihood of being over-
weight. No other relationship was significant for both sub-
samples. Table 1 summarizes the standardized maximum
likelihood coefficients and indicates significant relationships.
Relationships Between Baseline Measures
and Functional Limitations
Table 2 summarizes the findings related to predicting the
onset of upper and lower body functional limitations. As
seen in Table 2, overall there was a paucity of replicated sig-
nificant linkages among risk factors and the onset of func-
tional limitations in 1988. The risk factors and pathology/
impairments were more strongly related to the onset of lower
body functional limitations in 1988 than to upper body
functional limitations in 1988 as reflected in the amount of
explained variance. Table 2 includes these values along with
the standardized estimates. For both subsamples, the onset
of lower body functional limitations was significantly asso-

ciated with being older, walking a mile less frequently, and
having musculoskeletal pathology/impairments. Upper body
functional limitations were also significantly related to being
older. This was the only replicated relationship associated
with upper body functional limitations.
Relationships Among Functional Limitations and Disability
Instrumental ADL disability. -- Figure 2 summarizes the
replicated, significant linkages for the development of IADL
disability (i.e., the significant findings from Tables 1, 2, and
3). Taken together, the results confirm the basic premise that
loss of basic physical function is an important intermediary
stage in the disability process, and suggest that lower body
function may be more of a factor than upper body function in
the early stages of instrumental ADL disability.
Table 3 summarizes the coefficients for the proposed
relationships among the functional limitations and IADL
disability. Of the risk factors and pathology/impairments,
only sex and age are included in Table 3 because, as depicted
in Figure 1, only they had proposed direct linkages to the
onset of disability in 1988, and the onset and progression of
functional limitations and disability in 1990. All other risk
factors and the pathology/impairments measured in 1984
were hypothesized to have an impact only through their
relationship with the onset of functional limitations in 1988.
This is consistent with the basic premise that functional
limitation is the main pathway for the onset of disability.

*p < :05.
As seen in Table 3, sex and age did not exhibit any signifi-
cant replicated associations with functional limitations and
IADL disability in 1990. This further supports the premise
that risk factors' main impact is through their relationship
with the onset of functional limitations. Consistent with
expectation (Figure 1), lower and upper body functional
limitations were significantly correlated in 1988 and in 1990.
Lower body functional limitations, but not upper body
functional limitations, were significantly related to instru-
mental ADL disability in 1988. However, both lower and
upper body functional limitations in 1990 were significantly
related to IADL disability in 1990.
Lower body functional limitations in 1988 predicted
lower body and upper body functional limitations in 1990. In
contrast, upper body functional limitations in 1988 only
predicted future levels of upper body functional limitations,
not future levels of lower body functional limitations.
Instrumental ADL disability level in 1988 was not a sig-
nificant predictor of future levels of functional limitations
when controlling for prior levels of functional limitations.
Instrumental ADL disability in 1988 and both upper and
lower body functional limitations in 1990 significantly pre-
dicted IADL disability in 1990. In contrast to predicting
initial onset of IADL disability in 1988, both upper body and
lower body functional limitations were significant predictors
of IADL disability in 1990. Lower body functioning seemed
to retain more of a role, even though upper body functioning
was now significant.
Overall Measures of Goodness-of-Fitfor the Model
It is useful to have an overall sense of how well the model
fit the data. Although we presented the substantive findings
based on stages of the conceptual model (Figure 1), it is
important to reiterate that the full model was evaluated.
Estimates of several measures of goodness-of-fit were evalu-
ated and are presented at the bottom of Table 3.
Taken as a whole, the model fit the data very well for both
subsamples. The goodness-of-fit index (GFI), the adjusted
goodness-of-fit index (AGFI), and the normed fit index
(NFI) are above the recommended value of .900, with some
indices approaching the ideal value of 1.000.
In addition, the modification indices supported the pro-
posed model and the premise that functional limitations are
the main driving force in the disablement process. That is, the
modification indices supported the theoretical position that
the critical role of baseline risk factors and pathology/
impairments in the disability process is through their relation-
ship to functional limitations in 1988. Further, the modifica-
tion indices supported the proposed linkages representing the
interplay between functional limitations and disability across
time. That is, the findings reinforce the hypothesized primary
path by which functional limitation in 1988 impacts on
disability in 1990 as being through functional limitation in
1990. Only five of the meaningful modification indices ex-
ceeded a cutpoint of 6.63 (the chi-square value associated
with 1 degree of freedom and .01 significance level). Of
these, none was replicated across subsamples. Apparently,
including these linkages would not make a significant contri-
bution and need not be incorporated in the model.
DISCUSSION
These results provide further support to the role that
lower-extremity function plays in predicting subsequent on-
set of disability (Guralnik et al., 1995). Thus, consistent
with Nagi's conceptual framework, the importance of func-
tional limitations as an intermediary driving force in the
disablement process should not be ignored. In addition, the
results confirm the premise that focusing on physical activity
levels is a fruitful intervention strategy for preventing dis-
ability, especially for older women. These relationships
were demonstrated through evaluating a model which incor-
porated the theoretical work of Nagi and allowed for clearer
inferences regarding causal order and the interplay among
functional limitations and instrumental ADL disabilities
across time by establishing a time-sequence among the risk
factors and pathology/impairments, and the onset of func-
tional limitations and IADL disabilities.
Johnson and Wolinsky (1993) recently examined cross-
sectional interrelationships among various disability concepts
using structural equation models. They reported that upper
S180 LAWRENCE AND JETTE
and lower functional limitations, rather than disease, were the
major correlates of disability. The results of our longitudinal
model clarify the causal ordering and interplay among func-
tional limitations and disability suggested by this earlier
work. Consistent with Nagi's basic disability model, behav-
ioral risk factors and underlying pathology/impairments af-
fect the subsequent onset of disability through their impact on
functional limitations. Functional limitations, in turn, have a
direct and consistent impact on incidence of IADL disability.
For the most part, disease and life style do not directly affect
disability.
In contrast to Johnson and Wolinsky (1993) but consistent
with other investigators (Guralnik et al., 1995; Jette,
Branch, and Berlin, 1990), we found that lower extremity
functional limitation was a stronger determinant of subse-
quent IADL disability than upper extremity functional limi-
tation. Only lower extremity functional limitation was re-
lated to subsequent degree of disability. And, although both
upper and lower extremity limitations were influential on the
incidence of IADL disability by 1990, lower extremity
functional limitation was a stronger predictor of disability
than upper extremity. In fact, in one subsample, lower
extremity functional limitation was a stronger predictor of
subsequent disability than previous disability level. These
findings probably reflect the important role of lower extrem-
ity function in the performance of complex, strenuous activi-
ties such as shopping, housekeeping, and food preparation.
The findings from these analyses further clarify the causal
mechanism behind previous findings from single-equation
cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses that level of physi-
cal activity is an important and consistent predictor of
disability (Branch, 1985; Hubert and Fries, 1994; Kaplan et
al., 1993;Moretal., 1989). In this study, level of frequency
of walking a mile had an indirect impact on incidence of
IADL disability through its direct effect on level of lower
extremity functional limitation. The frequency with which
both men and women walked a mile each week in 1984 was a
significant determinant of lower extremity functional limita-
tion in 1988. This finding lends support to those who wish to
attribute a causal linkage between maintaining an active life
style and protection against functional decline in later life.
The result for frequency of walking a mile lends further
support to recent work that advocates the potential beneficial
effects of reactivating older adults as a means of primary and
secondary prevention of disability in later life (Fiatarone et
al., 1994; Fried et al., 1991; Schroll, 1994; Verbrugge and
Jette, 1994).
In the present analyses, physical activity was measured by
a single item: frequency of walking a mile per week. It is
unfortunate that additional items which met our criterion for
measuring physical activities were not available. Although
frequency of walking provides a limited definition, the
findings are important for several reasons. One, the findings
are consistent with expectations and other research, and thus
lend further support to the importance of activity. Two, the
findings suggest that even a simple, easily prescribed activ-
ity such as walking a mile per week can make a difference.
That is, by focusing on a particular activity which is rela-
tively simple and clearly defined, an important piece of
information has been highlighted for those trying to reacti-
vate sedentary elderly persons who might be intimidated by
"exercise" programs and equipment.
When controlling for functional limitations and disability
at baseline, sex was not an independent, replicated predictor
of onset of either functional limitations or disabilities in 1988
or 1990. This is consistent with findings reported by others,
including Branch (1985), Guralnik and Kaplan (1989), and
Katz et al. (1983). The counterbalancing effects of higher
survival in females and greater likelihood of high function-
ing among surviving males is one explanation of this pattern
(e.g., Guralnik and Kaplan, 1989). That is, there are small
differences in average remaining disability-free years but
such differences do not reflect the large differences in life
expectancy. By definition, the model evaluates the disability
process for respondents who were nondisabled in 1984 and
who survived and were reinterviewed through 1990.
Although sex did not have any replicated significant direct
effects, there were some important significant indirect ef-
fects. These important indirect effects were predominantly
played out through the relationship between sex and activity
level. Being female was associated with lower levels of
activity, and thus, in turn, indirectly associated with more
lower body functional limitations and instrumental ADL
disabilities in 1988, and more upper and lower body func-
tional limitations in 1990. The indirect effects of sex on the
disablement process underscore the potential benefits el-
derly women could experience with increased levels of
activity.
The overall pattern of results associated with age and
musculoskeletal problems further reinforces the importance
of the intermediary role of lower and upper body functional
limitations. That is, being older was associated with the
initial onset of lower and upper body functional limitations
in 1988, but, as with sex of the respondent, age had no
replicated independent effects on the emergence of disability
in 1988 and 1990. Having more musculoskeletal problems
was associated with the onset of lower body functional
limitations in 1988. Again, it is worth noting that age did not
have a replicated direct effect on disability in 1988 or 1990,
and there was no indication that musculoskeletal problems
had an effect on disability independent of its relationship
with lower body functioning. Both age and musculoskeletal
problems did have important significant indirect effects on
disability, predominantly via their relationship with lower
body functional limitations in 1988.
The pattern of findings and the goodness-of-fit indices all
indicate that the proposed model fit the data very well, and
thus support the basic premise that functional limitations
lead to disability and drive the disablement process. How-
ever, a time-ordered sequence was imposed on the cross-
sectional data (i.e., functional limitations in 1988 causally
related to level of disability in 1988) and the longitudinal
relationships (i.e., functional limitations in 1988 causally
related directly to functional limitations in 1990 and only
indirectly related to disability in 1990). Although based on
theory and previous research, caution is warranted without
having more and shorter time intervals to allow a finer
analysis of the time-ordered sequencing of the proposed
process. In lieu of such information, another model was
evaluated which did not impose a causal ordering between
DISABLEMENT PROCESS S181
functional limitations and disability within 1988 and 1990,
and allowed upper and lower functional limitations and
disability in 1988 to each causally impact on upper and lower
functional limitations, and disability in 1990. The results
from this analysis (not shown) also lend support to the
proposed time-ordered sequence. Lower body functional
limitations in 1988 significantly predicted disability in 1990
even after controlling for disability level in 1988 for both
subsamples. This in in contrast to the longitudinal findings
for disability. For both subsamples, disability in 1988 did
not significantly predict upper or lower functional limita-
tions in 1990 after controlling for prior levels of functional
limitations.
There are four major conceptual areas which need to be
refined and expanded in future work for a fuller understand-
ing of the disablement process. One area deals with extending
the model to understand other disability domains, including
activities of daily living. This is particularly important be-
cause prior research indicates that the importance of upper
and lower functional limitations may be a function of whether
one is evaluating basic ADLs or instrumental ADLs (e.g.,
Jette, Branch, and Berlin, 1990). A second area focuses on
expanding the model to include reactions and adjustments
made in response to limitations and disabilities (e.g., Avlund,
Davidsen, and Schultz-Larsen, 1995). A third area deals with
evaluating race as a risk factor. The cumulating evidence
suggests that there are important differences between Cauca-
sians and African Americans, and important differences at
different points across the life span. Evaluating the process
separately by race would provide more complete information
about these issues and do the greatest justice to the subtle but
important trends that have been observed (Gibson, 1991;
Gibson and Jackson, 1987; Manton, Patrick, and Johnson,
1987). And finally, a fourth area reflects refinement of the
measurement intervals and the measures. Expanding the
model by including more measurement points and shorter
intervals would help refine the causal relationship and provide
a better sense of intervention strategies.
The present findings provide not only a foundation for
future model building, but also provide an important mes-
sage for researchers and clinicians. Functional limitation is a
crucial intermediary stage and should be a focus of interven-
tion strategies. The risk factor which emerged as a consistent
predictor of the onset of functional limitations was frequency
of walking a mile. Unlike some risk factors, frequency of
walking a mile may be more amenable to intervention.
Clearly, the results underscore the value of clinical trials
focusing on minimizing functional limitations as a strategy
for preventing disability, and the potential benefits elderly
women especially could experience with increased physical
activity levels.

Place: The University of Chicago
A Public-Use Tape tracing about 40,000 Union Army Men from early childhood to
death is now being made available to investigators. The October conference is intended
for potential users of the tape who wish to know more about the characteristics of the
data set and the procedures that have been developed for managing approximately 9,000
variables on each observation. This randomly drawn longitudinal sample was designed
to analyze early life factors that contribute to labor force behavior, chronic disease and
mortality of individuals in later life. It can also be used to compare prevalence rates of
diseases among males sixty-five and over in 1910 and at the present time. Individuals
interested in participating in the conference should write to: Mark A. Rudberg, M.D.,
