Abstract
Background: The peak shift model predicts that the age-profile of a pathogen's prevalence depends upon its transmission
rate, peaking earlier in populations with higher transmission and declining as partial immunity is acquired. Helminth
infections are associated with increased immunoglobulin E (IgE), which may convey partial immunity and influence the peak
shift. Although studies have noted peak shifts in helminths, corresponding peak shifts in total IgE have not been
investigated, nor has the age-patterning been carefully examined across populations. We test for differences in the age-
patterning of IgE between two South American forager-horticulturalist populations and the United States: the Tsimane of
Bolivia (n = 832), the Shuar of Ecuador (n = 289), and the U.S. NHANES (n = 8,336). We then examine the relationship between
total IgE and helminth prevalences in the Tsimane.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Total IgE levels were assessed in serum and dried blood spots and age-patterns
examined with non-linear regression models. Tsimane had the highest IgE (geometric mean = 8,182 IU/ml), followed by
Shuar (1,252 IU/ml), and NHANES (52 IU/ml). Consistent with predictions, higher population IgE was associated with steeper
increases at early ages and earlier peaks: Tsimane IgE peaked at 7 years, Shuar at 10 years, and NHANES at 17 years. For
Tsimane, the age-pattern was compared with fecal helminth prevalences. Overall, 57% had detectable eggs or larva, with
hookworm (45.4%) and Ascaris lumbricoides (19.9%) the most prevalent. The peak in total IgE occurred around the peak in A.
lumbricoides, which was associated with higher IgE in children ,10, but with lower IgE in adolescents.
Conclusions: The age-patterning suggests a peak shift in total IgE similar to that seen in helminth infections, particularly A.
lumbricoides. This age-patterning may have implications for understanding the effects of helminths on other health
outcomes, such as allergy, growth, and response to childhood vaccination.

Introduction
Age-related epidemiological patterns are thought to result from
complex interactions between parasite life cycle, exposure to
infection, and host-immunity [1,2]. Helminth infections show
characteristic age-patterning, peaking around puberty and then
declining during adulthood [3­5]. However, this pattern varies
with infection prevalence and intensity, tending to both peak and
decline earlier in populations with higher rates of transmission.
This ``peak shift'' is thought to result from the interaction between
the rate at which new individuals are infected and the rate at
which partial immunity is acquired [1,2]. According to this model,
when transmission is high infection occurs more quickly, leading to
a higher prevalence at a younger age. However, earlier infection
also leads to an earlier acquisition of immunity, leading to a
decline in prevalence following the peak.
Although studies have found age-patterns in helminth preva-
lences consistent with this hypothesis, few studies have examined
whether the age-patterning of immune responses follows similar
patterns. Those studies that have examined the age-patterning of
immune responses have generally focused on parasite specific
immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE) [6­11]. These have
shown age-patterns that resemble the age-specific prevalences of
parasites. However, in addition to specific responses, helminth
infections are associated with a general shift in the host immune
system towards a TH
2-biased phenotype, characterized in

particular by increased production of total IgE. Although specific
responses are thought to participate in protection against infection
and thus the generation of peak-shift patterns, an examination of
total IgE levels is also critical for understanding the effects of
helminths on health and immune function. Due to stimulation of
TH
2 responses, total IgE is likely to represent the total burden of
multiple helminth species infection better than species specific
immunoglobulins. Like specific IgE, total IgE levels are elevated in
infected individuals and fall with treatment [12,13], and have been
shown to correlate with specific IgE for Ascaris lumbricoides and T.
trichiura [14]. However, total IgE levels in heavily parasitized
individuals remain elevated compared to individuals in industri-
alized countries for substantial periods of time [15], suggesting
persistent changes in host immune function.
Mounting an immune response is energetically costly, necessi-
tating reductions in competing life history demands, including
growth, reproduction, and survival [16­17]. Higher total IgE
levels are associated with poorer growth and shorter adult stature,
suggesting a trade-off between growth and investment into
immune response [18]. Moreover, the shifting of immune function
towards a TH
2 phenotype may reduce TH
1 responses, decreasing
the effectiveness of vaccines or increasing susceptibility to viruses
and bacteria [19­21].
These effects may depend, in part, on the timing of exposure, as
exposure to helminths during critical periods may bias the
development of immune function or a child's growth trajectory.
Helminths infect more than one seventh of the world's population,
and given the peak-shift pattern, a disproportionate number of
those infected are schoolchildren [22]. As a consequence, age-
patterns in helminth infection and immune response are likely to
have significant consequences on growth and development.
Although several studies have reported that IgE increases
quickly in the first 5­10 years of life and then levels off [23,24], few
studies have carefully examined the age-patterning of total IgE
and we know of no published studies that have compared age-
patterning in IgE across multiple populations. As a marker of
helminth infection and TH
2-biasing of T-cell responses, an
understanding of the age-patterning of total IgE is important for
understanding the broader consequences of helminth infections on
life history parameters. The current study describes in detail the
age-patterning of IgE levels in three populations. These include
data from the United States collected by the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey 2005­2006 (NHANES) and data
from two populations of South American forager-horticulturalists:
the Tsimane of Boliva and the Shuar of Ecuador. First, we test for
predicted associations between population mean IgE level and the
age-pattern of IgE. Second, using Tsimane data we examine the
relationship between age-patterning in IgE and age-patterning in
helminth infections.
Methods
Study Populations
Shuar. Shuar are Amerindians from the Amazonas region of
Ecuador [25,26]. Shuar live across a wide range of circumstances,
but a large portion of the population continues traditional
subsistence based on horticulture, hunting, and fishing.
Approximately 40% of Shuar children are stunted, a higher
prevalence than is found in other indigenous and non-indigenous
children living in the same area [27]. Although we know of no
studies examining helminth infections in the Shuar, recent studies
report infection rates of around 50% in other Amazonian
Ecuadorian populations, with Ascaris the most prevalent parasite
[28,29]. Shuar data were collected as part of the Shuar Life
History Project (www.bonesandbehavior.org/shuar) in a village
that has been previously described [18].
Tsimane. Tsimane are forager-horticulturalists that live
along the Maniqui River in lowland Bolivia. Tsimane subsist
primarily on cultivation of plantains, rice, manioc, and corn, as well
as hunting, fishing, and gathering. Tsimane show high levels of
inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein [30­32].
Helminth infections are highly prevalent, with hookworm (Necator
americanus or Ancylostoma duodenale) being the predominant parasite,
infecting between 44% and 76% of children [33,34]. Between 40­
50% of children are stunted [35,36]. The data for this study were
collected as part of the Tsimane Health and Life History Project
(http://www.unm.edu/,tsimane/), in sixteen villages representing
a range of environmental and economic situations (interior forest,
riverine, acculturated, non-acculturated).
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES). NHANES is a large-scale, national survey of
health, nutrition, and social factors conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics and Center for Disease Control. This
study uses data from the NHANES 2005­2006 dataset (http://
www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nhanes2005-2006/nhanes05_06.htm).
The sample includes 8,336 individuals, 88% percent U.S. citizens,
52% percent female, 27% Mexican-American, 36% Caucasian,
26% African-American, and 11% other ethnicities.
Ethics Statement
For Shuar, permission to conduct the study was first obtained
from the Federaci
´on Interprovincial de Centros Shuar (FICSH),
the elected representational organization for Shuar affairs. Second,
permission was obtained from elected village leaders. Third, a
village meeting was held in which a village-level consent form was
read aloud, the study explained, questions answered, and a
community decision reached about whether to allow the study.
Individuals were informed that they could choose not to
participate, participate only in individual portions of the study,
or participate in the full study. At the time of data collection,
individual oral consent was obtained, with individuals able to opt-
in or out of individual components of the study (e.g., to provide
blood spots or not). For subjects under age fifteen (the local age of
consent) both parental consent and child assent were obtained.
Oral consent was used for two reasons: 1) many Shuar are non or
Author Summary
Infection with parasitic worms, known as helminths, alters
the immune system, causing individuals to produce high
levels of a type of antibody known as immunoglobulin E
(IgE). IgE is typically very low in western populations, but is
many times higher where helminth infections are com-
mon, particularly indigenous populations in South Amer-
ica. Helminths infect more than one seventh of the world's
population. Since helminths tend to infect people at
younger ages in areas where they are more common, a
disproportionate number of those affected are schoolchil-
dren. In this paper we examine IgE levels in two
indigenous South American groups in comparison to
levels in the United States. In these groups we find that IgE
levels are not only higher, but that they also reach their
highest levels at earlier ages in more infected populations.
This finding is important since effects on immune function,
including IgE production, may have additional conse-
quences if they occur at young ages, changing the
development of allergy and asthma, growth, and response
to vaccines.

semi-literate or have only a few years of schooling, and 2) many
Shuar are suspicious or uncomfortable with signing documents
due to a history of territorial land disputes and wariness about
signed documents leading to ownership conflicts. An independent
bilingual Shuar village leader, nurse, FISCH official or assistant
was present to translate as needed during group and individual
consent and study procedures. The study and consent procedures
were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the
University of Oregon.
For Tsimane, informed consent was obtained at three levels: 1)
from the Gran Consejo Tsimane, the local Tsimane government
organization that represents Tsimane interests and oversees all
projects, 2) community officials and participants in village
meetings, and 3) individual consent during medical visits and
before each procedure. After explanation of a formal protocol by
bilingual Tsimane assistants, consent forms were signed for literate
participants, and verbal approval with fingerprint signature given
for non-literate participants. Tsimane consent procedures were
approved by the IRBs at the University of New Mexico, University
of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Southern
California.
Blood Collection and Analysis
Shuar. Shuar samples were collected following standard
procedures to collect dried blood spots [37]. IgE levels were
determined by ELISA at the University of Oregon, following a
commercially available protocol (Bethyl Labs, Inc.: #E80-108 and
#E101) adapted for use with blood spots [38]. Blood spot
collection and IgE analyses have been previously described [18].
Tsimane. Tsimane blood samples were collected by
venipuncture during annual medical exams conducted by
Bolivian physicians. Serum was frozen in liquid nitrogen for
transport to New Mexico. Two rounds of samples were collected.
The first 223 samples were collected in 2004­2005 and analyzed
by TriCore Laboratories (Albuquerque, NM) for total IgE
(catalog: L2KIE6) using an Immulite 2000 (Siemens Corp;
Deerfield, IL). An additional 700 samples were collected in 2007
and analyzed in the laboratory of JJS at the University of Oregon
using the same commercial ELISA kit used for Shuar samples
(Bethyl Labs, Inc.: #E80-108 and #E101). Of these, 91 were
repeated measures for individuals included in the first batch of
samples. These samples were excluded so as not to confound
longitudinal and cross-sectional data. After excluding these cases,
the first and second samples did not differ in geometric mean IgE
(comparison of log transformed IgE: t = .462, df = 830, p = .644).
NHANES. NHANES samples were collected by venipucture
by trained phlebotomists. Determination of total IgE was done using
the ImmunoCAP 1000 system (Pharmacia Diagnostics) by the
Department of Pathology Immunology Laboratory at Elmhurst
Memorial Hospital, Elmhurst, IL. Details can be found at http://
www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_05_06/al_ige_d_met_
specific_ige_total_ige.pdf.
Comparability of Blood Samples. A handful of studies
have compared IgE in dried blood spots to IgE measured in serum
and found results to be virtually identical [39,40]. Additionally, the
ELISA procedure used to determine blood spot IgE in this study
has been validated against controls with known IgE levels [38]. To
verify the comparability of IgE obtained from dried blood spots
with that obtained from serum, six matched blood spot and serum
samples were analyzed using both methods. The values obtained
from dried blood spots were highly correlated with the values from
serum (r = 0.98, p,.001). Blood spot values were ,3% higher.
Using linear regression, the following conversion factor was
obtained to convert dried blood spot values into serum values
prior to other analyses: IgEserum
= 0.9656IgEDBS
23.458 (IU/ml).
Fecal Analysis
Tsimane fecal samples were analyzed using two methods. From
2004 to 2008 fecal samples were analyzed for the presence of
helminth eggs and larvae by direct identification on wet mounts.
As described in greater detail elsewhere [33], duplicate mounts
were prepared with 0.9% saline solution and iodine solution,
respectively, and examined at 100x and 400x for helminth eggs
(hookworm, A. lumbricoides, and T. trichiuris), and larvae (S.
stercoralis). Beginning in 2007, fecal samples were also preserved
in 10% formalin solution following direct identification, and later
quantitatively analyzed using a modified Percoll (Amersham
Pharmacia) technique [41].
Of the two methods, the Percoll technique is more sensitive,
producing slightly higher detection rates than direct identification
(59.4% vs. 51.9% infected). These differences may be due to the
greater efficiency of the Percoll technique in detecting eggs in
fibrous stools and at low-intensities [41]. However, for the present
study the differences between the two methods were not
qualitatively great enough to justify using only data produced by
one method or the other. We therefore aggregated data from the
two methods, coding individuals as either infected or not infected if
helminths were detected by either method. In total 1,495
individuals had Percoll results, with the remaining 3,610 having
only direct results.
Age Estimation
Birth dates accurate to the month were available from health
clinic and school records for most Shuar children. For Shuar
adults, birth dates on government identification were cross-
checked with extensive genealogical information collected from
multiple informants. Tsimane genealogies were collected during
demographic interviews done on individuals over age 18
(n = 1,098). Tsimane ages were estimated based on written
records, such as those kept by Catholic missionaries, demographic
interviews with independent cross-checking of genealogies and
reproductive histories with multiple informants, and the use of
photographs of people with known ages [42].

Data Analysis
Prior to data analysis, IgE values were converted into
international units (1 IU = 2.4 ng/ml). IgE is log-normally distrib-
uted in all three populations (Figure 1), so values were natural log
transformed (lnIgE) before all analyses. For t-tests, reported means
are geometric means calculated by taking the exponential of the
mean log values used in the t-test. Descriptive statistics and t-tests
were done in PASW Statistics 18.0 (formerly SPSS Statistics, SPSS
Inc.). All other analyses were done in R 2.10.1 (www.r-project.org).
Generalized additive models (GAM; [43,44]) were used to
examine the non-parametric age pattern of IgE levels for each
population. Models were fit with the gam procedure in package
mgcv using thin plate regression splines [45,46]. Since the cases in
each population were not evenly distributed by age, initial basis
knots were specified for each population based on even ten-
percentiles of the age distribution, allowing knots to be spaced with
an equal number of cases between them (Figure 2). Apart from the
basis knots, smoothing parameters were generated automatically
according to gam defaults [45]. GAM models included an
intercept, a sex factor, a spline for age, and a spline for age-by-
sex interaction.
In initial models, similar IgE levels at birth were predicted
among Shuar and NHANES, with the Shuar model predicting IgE
of 7 IU/ml for females and 9 IU/ml for males, and the NHANES
model predicting 15 IU/ml for females and 21 IU/ml for males.
However, due to the relatively low number of Tsimane under age
five, initial Tsimane models were essentially straight lines, with
peak IgE predicted at birth. A number of studies have found

extremely low IgE levels at birth (,1 IU/ml) [47-50,23,51,52],
even in infants of mothers with helminth infections and high IgE
[53,54]. Given the convergence of the other two models and these
previous findings, we used dummy cases with age zero and IgE
equal to 15 IU/ml to anchor Tsimane models to a similar
intercept at birth. Dummy cases were included in GAM models
but not in any other statistic.
GAM models with a binomial logit-link function were also used
to estimate odds-ratios for Tsimane helminth infection by age.
Associations between helminth infection and IgE levels were
estimated in linear models controlling for infection with other
helminths, sex, and age.
In addition to GAM, two other methods were used to verify age
shapes and compare populations. In the first, a stepwise linear
regression was used to identify critical age-related changes in lnIgE
for each population. Dummy variables were coded for each
unique age indicating whether a case was greater than the given
age (e.g., [55]). Starting from a model with only an intercept and
sex term, stepAIC (package MASS) was used to enter and remove
age variables to minimize model AIC [56].
For the second test we constructed non-linear models composed
of linear segments linked together, with model terms representing
the point at which the linear segments are stitched together. In this
model, model terms directly represent critical ages, such as the age
at which the model peaks, so differences in critical ages between
populations can be tested using population interaction terms. The
basic model is:

are the slopes for the segments, and
additional terms b0
and bs
represent the intercept at age zero and
sex effect, respectively. Three logistic functions serve to ``turn-on'',
``turn-off'', and maintain the value reached at each age transition.
The models were fit such that a1
is the initial age where rapid
increases in IgE level out, a2
is the age at which IgE peaks for the
population, and a3
is the age at which IgE reaches mean adult
levels. Models were solved using nls (package stats) using the nl2sol
algorithm. Initial values specified based on GAM regressions and
only individuals under age 50 were used for modeling.
Results
Age-Pattern of IgE
Of the three populations, Tsimane had the highest IgE levels
(geometric mean = 8,182 IU/ml), followed by Shuar (1,252 IU/
ml), and NHANES (52 IU/ml) (Table 1). IgE distributions were
skewed but largely normalized by log-transformation (Figure 1).
All three groups differed from one another in pair-wise
comparisons (all t-test p-values ,.001 after Bonferroni correction).
In all three populations, males had higher IgE than females.
NHANES males had IgE levels 60% higher than females (65.9 vs.
41.3 IU/ml, t = 14.08, p,.01), while Shuar males had IgE values
29% higher than Shuar females (1,457 vs. 1,129 IU/ml, t = 2.15,
p = .03), and Tsimane males had levels 16% above females
(8,720 vs. 7,527 IU/ml, t = 2.73, p,.01).
Upon initial visual examination of the data, age patterns were
observed to be non-linear. We therefore used thin plate regression
splines in GAM models to examine the age patterning of IgE
(Figure 2A). Age terms were significant in all models (Tsimane:
edf = 10.94, F = 43.15, p,.001; Shuar: edf = 7.73, F = 5.35,
p,.001; NHANES: edf = 8.93, F = 24.74, p,.001). Despite
differences in level, all three populations had similar age-related
IgE profiles, characterized by a rapid increase before age five, a
peak in the juvenile or adolescent period, and a decrease into
adulthood. However, a number of features differ between
populations. Principal among these is the age at which IgE
initially peaks. Tsimane IgE peaked at 7.3 years for males and 7.2
years for females. Shuar IgE peaked at 10.2 for both sexes.
NHANES IgE did not peak until age 16.9 for males and 16.4 for
females. Fitting a linear model to the three population points for
each sex suggested that for males the peak age decreases by 1.98

(t = 18.40, p = 0.04), while for females the peak age decreases by
1.76 years per unit increase in lnIgE (t = 25.25, p = 0.03).
We next used stepwise linear regression with ordinal age
variables to identify ages at which important transitions in IgE
level occur and to test the significance of these changes (Figure 2B).
Tsimane transitions included an increase at age three (b = 1.06,
t = 1.90, p = 0.06) followed by a decrease after age nine
(b = 20.21, t = 22.26, p = 0.02). For Shuar, there were significant
increases after age two (b = 1.07, t = 2.10, p = 0.04) and age three
(b = 1.18, t = 3.75, p,0.01), and a significant decrease after age
eleven (b = 20.41, t = 23.59, p,0.01). In the NHANES sample
increases were present in the model after age one (b = 0.48,
t = 3.82, p,0.01), age three (b = 0.22, t = 1.60, p = 0.10), age four
(b = 0.27, t = 1.90, p = 0.05), age six (b = 0.15, t = 1.67, p =
0.10), and age fifteen (b = 0.13, t = 2.00, p = 0.04), with a decrease
after age eighteen (b = 20.19, t = 22.79, p,0.01).
Since neither of these models directly tests for differences
between populations or allows for the comparison of shape
differences in age curves or peaks, we devised a non-linear
modeling procedure in which four linear segments are used to
model the age profile (Figure 2B). These models include three ages
points that correspond to the point at which the rapid increases in
early life levels off (a1
), the age at which IgE peaks in the
population (a2
), and the age at which IgE reaches adult levels after
the peak (a3
). Three slopes (b1­3
) describe the change in IgE
between age points (birth ­ a1
, a1
to a2
, and a2
to a3
). A sex term
accounts for the difference between males and females (bs
).
Models were first fit for the three populations independently
(Table 2). Model parameters conformed well to predictions from
GAM models, with peak ages (a2
) of 8.2, 10.0, and 17.9 predicted
for Tsimane, Shuar, and NHANES respectively. The ages of
initial slope change and final adult level also corresponded to peak
ages, with both ages earliest in Tsimane and latest in NHANES.
Moreover, all model parameters were highly correlated with IgE
levels (Figure 3). Age terms, initial slopes from age zero, and sex
differences all correlated with mean log IgE (a1
: r = 21.00,p,0.01;
a2
: r = 20.98, p = 0.13; a3
: r = 21.00,p = 0.01; b1
: r = 0.99,
p = 0.02; bs
: r = 20.99, p = 0.09), while the increase between the
first peak and the final peak, and the decrease from the final peak to
adult levels correlated with untransformed population geometric
mean IgE (b2
: 1.00, p = 0.06, b3
: 21.00, p,0.01).
To compare populations on these terms we first attempted to fit
models with population interaction terms for each parameter.
However, this model, with 21 parameters, was too complex for the
model algorithms and the data available, and failed to fit. Instead
we simplified the models based on the relationship between model
parameters and population mean IgE levels. In the first of these
models we included parameter by population IgE interaction
terms (Table 3, Model 1). This model verified interactions between
population IgE and all model parameters, with each one unit
increase in log IgE associated with a 0.37 year decrease in the age
of the initial slope change, a 1.70 year decrease in the age of peak
IgE, and a 4.10 year decrease in the age at which levels dropped to
adult mean values. The initial rate of increase in IgE was also
significantly related to IgE mean levels indicating bother faster and
earlier acquisition of high IgE in the Tsimane and secondarily the
Shuar.
In the second, third, and forth models we tested population
differences in the ages at which slopes change, using population
factor terms rather than interactions with population IgE. In
Model 2 all three ages were left independent and the Shuar were
used as a contrast group, since they lie between Tsimane and
NHANES. In this model NHANES a1
and a2
were significantly

later than Shuar ages, and a3
was later but with marginal
significance. Although all three Tsimane ages were early than
Shuar ages, none were significantly so, although all three were
significantly earlier than NHANES ages when the model was run
with NHANES as the contrast group (not-shown). Given the
strong correlation between all three ages and mean IgE levels, we
suspected that multicollinearity between terms might be reducing
parameter significance. We therefore examined how a1
, a2
, and a3
might be included as functions of a single age term. By fitting
linear models to the parameters in Table 3 we found that

60.22, and a3
,0.90+a2
61.50. We used these terms
in Model 3, removing a1
and a3
. In this model with a single age
term to describe the shape, ages in both Tsimane and NHANES
were significantly different from Shuar ages, with the overall age
shape shifted earlier in Tsimane and later in NHANES.
Tsimane Age-Pattern of Helminth Infection
Overall, 57% of Tsimane participants were infected with at least
one helminth species, with hookworm (45.3%) and A. lumbricoides
(19.88%) the most prevalent, and S. stercoralis (5.6%) and T. trichiura
(3.2%) less common (Table 4). In order to compare the IgE age-
pattern with helminth infection patterns, we examined likelihood
of helminth infection by age in the Tsimane sample using logistic
GAM models (Figure 4). By sex the only significant difference was
in A. lumbricoides infection, with women being more likely to be
infected (22% vs. 18%, x2 = 15.5, p,.001). By age, the odds-ratio
of hookworm infection is highest in adults over age 45, but also has
a small peak at age 12.8. In contrast, the odds-ratio for infection
with A. lumbricoides peaks sharply at age 8.1 and then declines,
mirroring the IgE age-pattern more closely. The odds-ratio for
infection with S. stercoralis peaks somewhat later, around age 24.9.
The odds of T. trichiura infection is essentially flat with respect to
age, reflecting the low prevalence of T. trichiura. Overall, the odds-
ratio for having any type of helminth infection peaks at age 11.1
and then declines until age 45, at which point it increases again.
Odds-ratios closely mirror actual prevalences by age group
(Table 4). For infected individuals we also examined whether
egg/larva burden showed age-patterning. The only significant
age-pattern was a slight decline in hookworm burden with age up
to about age thirteen (not shown). Other egg/larva burdens did
not show age-patterning independent of changes in detection
prevalence.
Association between Helminth Infection and IgE Levels
We examined the association between helminth infection and
IgE levels in our Tsimane sample using regression models to
control for co-infection status, and with the sample divided by age
group (Figure 5). Hookworm infection was significantly associated
with higher IgE levels in 11­20 year-olds (b = 0.44, t = 2.85,
p,0.01), individuals over forty (b = 0.25, t = 3.35, p,0.01), and in
the overall sample (b = 0.23, t = 4.08, p,0.01). A. lumbricoides
infection was significantly associated with higher IgE levels in
individuals #10 years-old (b = 0.41, t = 1.96, p = 0.05), but with
significantly lower IgE levels in 11­20 year-olds (b = 20.45,
t = 22.45, p = 0.02). Although non-significant, T. trichiura infection
showed a pattern similar to A. lumbricoides in those 10 and younger
(b = 0.84, t = 1.41, p = 0.16). S. stercoralis was positively associated
with IgE levels only considering the overall sample (b = 0.32,
t = 2.24, p = 0.03).
From the total sample, 459 individuals had IgE levels and full
Percoll egg/larva counts. Of these, 195 were positive for
hookworm, 89 for A. lumbricoides, 18 for S. stercoralis, and 16 for
T. trichiura. Examining infected individuals only, egg/larva counts
were not significantly correlated with lnIgE, either in the overall
sample or with the sample dived by age.
Discussion
We report on the age patterning of IgE in three populations:
U.S. residents, Ecuadorian Shuar, and Bolivian Tsimane. The
highest known IgE levels are found among lowland South
American populations [18]. Tsimane IgE levels fit this pattern
and resemble the levels of other South American groups with low
levels of market integration (e.g., [14,57,58]). Tsimane levels are
significantly higher than typical values in the United States, even
for individuals reporting high levels of allergic symptoms (based on
NHANES data, analysis not shown). In contrast, despite
inhabiting a similar neotropical environment, Shuar display lower
IgE, resembling other South Americans living in rural areas
[12,13,59]. However, Shuar IgE was also significantly higher than
NHANES values.
Although many studies have reported elevated IgE levels in
populations infected with parasites such as helminths and malaria,
very few have carefully characterized the age-patterning of IgE,

tion geometric mean IgE levels. The upper panel shows fits

and none that we are aware of has tested for a peak shift. A
number of studies have noted that IgE is very low at birth, but
increases rapidly in the first five years of life [23,24,52,60].
However, most of these studies have been conducted in North
America or Europe, and most report that IgE is relatively stable
after age five or six without characterizing the degree of stability.
One of the few studies to report detailed age profiles found an
initial increase to age nine, a slight decrease, and then a second

peak at age fifteen in Croatian children [61]. The shape of the
increase, with an initial peak and then a second peak, is
remarkably similar to the age profiles seen in this study for the
NHANES and Shuar sample. Our results suggest that IgE does
reach an initial plateau between ages three and five, but continues
to increase slowly before reaching higher peaks at age seventeen in
the U.S, age ten in the Shuar, and age seven in the Tsimane. It is
important to note that although we report the peaks for simplicity,
the overall shape of the pattern is more important than the peak
itself. This includes a faster rate of increase at an earlier age, an
earlier peak, and an earlier decline to adult levels.
The age-patterns we report in this study are consistent with
mathematical models for what is known as the peak shift [1,2,62].
The peak shift model predicts that immunity will develop earlier in
populations with higher exposure and transmission rates and
subsequently decline earlier as cohorts acquire partial immunity.
The peak shift hypothesis was formulated with regard to helminth
infections. Typically, helminth infections peak just before or
during adolescence [1,4,5,22]. Although data on helminth
infections was only available for one of our three populations,
we suggest that the IgE levels and peak ages reported in this study
for Shuar and Tsimane are likely the consequence of high
helminths loads since helminths are a primary cause of elevated
IgE in rural populations. The IgE patterns reported also match
expectations from helminth infections. The lack of helminth data
for the NHANES participants may also not be much of a
limitation, as what studies exist support the assumption that
helminths among US residents are likely to be much less prevalent
than among either Shuar or Tsimane. There are few recent
estimates, but in 1972 Warren estimated that 4.0 million
Americans were infected with A. lumbricoides, 2.2 million with T.
trichiuris, 0.7 million with hookworm, and 0.4 million with S.
stercoralis [63]. Given the US population in 1972, these are
prevalences of 1.9%, 1.0%, 0.3%, and 0.2% respectively. Hotez
revises Warren's estimate for S. stercoralis to a current estimate of
68­100,000 or 0.05% of the 2008 population [64]. Similarly, of
216,275 stool samples sent to state laboratories in 1987, only 0.8%
were positive for A. lumbricoides, 1.2% for T. trichiuris, 1.5% for
hookworm, and 0.4% for S. stercoralis [65]. A similar study
examined 2,896 samples sent to state laboratories in 2000 and
found that 0.4% were positive for A. lumbricoides [66]. These
estimates are clearly much lower than the prevalences we report
for Tsimane and the prevalences reported for other ethnic groups
living near the Shuar, enough so that the exact prevalence is not
critical for interpreting our findings.
Due to TH
2 biasing, total IgE may be a better index of total
helminth load than specific IgE levels. However, the lack of
parasite-specific IgE in these data sets is also a limitation in that we
cannot state how much parasite-specific IgE contributes to total
levels. It may be that Shuar and Tsimane differ less in the total
helminth prevalences than they do in prevalences of particular
helminth species. Using helminth infection data for the Tsimane
we were able to examine associations between helminth species
and total IgE. We found that the overall age-pattern for IgE in the
Tsimane resembled the age-pattern for A. lumbricoides infection. A.
lumbricoides infection was associated with higher IgE levels in
children age 3­10, but with lower IgE levels in 11­20 year-olds.
These data suggest that this species may contribute more to the
age-pattern of IgE than others. Hookworm and Strongyloides
infection were also associated with higher IgE in the overall
sample, but showed less age-pattern in association. Future studies
will need to investigate this in more detail by examining specific-
IgE and extending into other populations.
The association between IgE and A. lumbricoides is consistent
with other studies showing that total IgE is correlated with specific
IgE to A. lumbricoides [14]. The positive association between A.
lumbricoides and IgE in participants under age ten and the negative
association after age ten may also suggest that IgE conveys partial

immunity to A. lumbricoides [67,68]. Other studies that [69] have
failed to find increased resistance with higher IgE may have not
taken this age-pattern into account.
Other parasites, such as Plasmodium falciparum, also raise total IgE
levels [70]. However, malaria is unlikely to be an important factor
for the populations studied in this paper. Although malaria is
present in parts of Shuar territory, it is not present in the villages
where the data for this paper were collected, and very few
individuals in the area report having had it. Malaria also appears
to be absent from the Tsimane territories, with no Tsimane
reporting malaria in extensive health interviews.
Finally, in all three populations IgE levels were higher in males.
Although noted in many studies (e.g., [23]), the reason for this sex
difference is not entirely clear. The only significant sex difference
in helminth infections was in A. lumbricoides, with slightly more
women being infected. Due to the higher IgE in males, it is
tempting to hypothesize that this is due to increased resistance in
males. However at present this is merely supposition. It is just as
likely that Tsimane women are infected more frequently because
they spend more time in direct contact with children, who
themselves have the greatest number of A. lumbricoides infections.
In addition to its importance for theoretical models describing
the epidemiology of infections, an understanding of the age
patterning of IgE may have public health implications. In
populations with higher parasite transmission rates, exposure
triggers an elevation of IgE at earlier ages. More rapid and heavy
investment in earlier immunocompetence may be favored with
high exposure, even at the expense of other investments, such as
growth. In Shuar children high IgE levels are associated with
increased stunting [18]. It seems plausible that insults to growth
may be most pronounced in populations in which peak infection
rates occur during critical growth periods, such as early
adolescence. Additionally, the timing of infection may affect the
development of immune function in other ways, for example by
affecting the TH
1/TH
2 balance, with consequences for the later
development of allergy [71]. Although these hypotheses remain to
be tested, they suggest that interventions might be developed with
the specific goal of shifting infection peaks toward less critical ages.
