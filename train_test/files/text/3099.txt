ALTHOUGH COMMUNITY SUR-
veys of mental disorders have
been conducted in the United
States since the end of World
War II,1-3 it was not until the early 1980s
that fully structured lay interviews were
developed to diagnose specific mental
disorders. The first such instrument was
theDiagnosticInterviewSchedule(DIS),4
which was developed for use in the Epi-
demiologic Catchment Area (ECA)
study5 to estimate the general popula-
tion prevalence of mental disorders by

talDisorders,ThirdEdition(DSM-III)cri-
teria.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD)
prevalence estimates in the ECA sites
were 3.0% to 5.9% for lifetime and 1.7%
to 3.4% for 12-month.7
Thefirstnationallyrepresentativesur-
vey using a method similar to the ECA,
theNationalComorbiditySurvey(NCS),8
was conducted a decade later in 1990-
1992. The NCS diagnostic instrument

Context Uncertainties exist about prevalence and correlates of major depressive dis-
order (MDD).
Objective To present nationally representative data on prevalence and correlates of
MDD by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-
IV) criteria, and on study patterns and correlates of treatment and treatment ad-
equacy from the recently completed National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R).
Design Face-to-face household survey conducted from February 2001 to Decem-
ber 2002.
Setting The 48 contiguous United States.
Participants Household residents ages 18 years or older (N=9090) who responded
to the NCS-R survey.
Main Outcome Measures Prevalence and correlates of MDD using the World
Health Organization's (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI),
12-month severity with the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-
Report (QIDS-SR), the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and the WHO disability assess-
ment scale (WHO-DAS). Clinical reinterviews used the Structured Clinical Interview for
DSM-IV.
Results The prevalence of CIDI MDD for lifetime was 16.2% (95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 15.1-17.3) (32.6-35.1 million US adults) and for 12-month was 6.6% (95%
CI, 5.9-7.3) (13.1-14.2 million US adults). Virtually all CIDI 12-month cases were inde-
pendently classified as clinically significant using the QIDS-SR, with 10.4% mild, 38.6%
moderate, 38.0% severe, and 12.9% very severe. Mean episode duration was 16 weeks
(95% CI, 15.1-17.3). Role impairment as measured by SDS was substantial as indicated
by 59.3% of 12-month cases with severe or very severe role impairment. Most lifetime
(72.1%) and 12-month (78.5%) cases had comorbid CIDI/DSM-IV disorders, with MDD
only rarely primary. Although 51.6% (95% CI, 46.1-57.2) of 12-month cases received
health care treatment for MDD, treatment was adequate in only 41.9% (95% CI, 35.9-
47.9) of these cases, resulting in 21.7% (95% CI, 18.1-25.2) of 12-month MDD being
adequately treated. Sociodemographic correlates of treatment were far less numerous
than those of prevalence.
Conclusions Major depressive disorder is a common disorder, widely distributed in
the population, and usually associated with substantial symptom severity and role im-
pairment. While the recent increase in treatment is encouraging, inadequate treat-
ment is a serious concern. Emphasis on screening and expansion of treatment needs
to be accompanied by a parallel emphasis on treatment quality improvement.

sion is a very common and very serious
illness.21,22 Indeed, the World Health
Organization (WHO) now ranks major
depressionasoneofthemostburdensome
diseases in the world.23
This growing recognition of the pub-
lic health burden of depression also has
led to the development and evaluation
of model primary care programs for de-
pression detection and treatment.24-26
Even though a number of these pro-
grams have been shown to be cost-
effective, dissemination has been
hampered by reluctance to implement
them on the part of primary care phy-
sicians.27
During this same time period, the
American Psychiatric Association in-
troduced the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edi-
tion (DSM-IV) system, which empha-
sizes the clinical significance require-
ment for a diagnosis of MDD more
prominently than did in the earlier DSM
editions.28 This new emphasis oc-
curred, in no small part, in reaction to
the perception that the prevalence es-
timates in the ECA study were unreal-
istically high. The even higher NCS es-
timates, which were published only
after the DSM-IV criteria were estab-
lished, only reinforced this concern.15
Indeed, a recent critique of the ECA and
NCS argued that a substantial propor-
tion of respondents classified as cases
were clinically insignificant, leading to
an overestimation of the 12-month de-
pression prevalence of 29% in the ECA
and of 58% in the NCS.29 However, this
critique was based on the use of im-
precise indicators for severity symp-
toms, raising questions about ad-
justed prevalence estimates.30
Based on the introduction of the
DSM-IVcriteria,inconjunctionwithevi-
dence of changes in treatment over the
past decade, a new national survey of
mental disorders was conducted in
2001-2002. The survey was designed to
update information on the prevalence,
correlates, and clinical significance of
DSM disorders, and to study patterns
and correlates of treatment and treat-
mentadequacy.Thecurrentreportisthe

sample distributions closely match
those of the US population on a vari-

Measures
Diagnostic Assessment. The NCS-R di-
agnostic instrument was an expanded
version of the WHO's CIDI,9 a fully
structured instrument for use by trained
interviewerswhodonothaveclinicalex-
perience. Diagnoses are based on
DSM-IV criteria.28 Organic exclusions
anddiagnostichierarchyruleswereboth
applied in making diagnoses. In addi-
tion to the prevalence and correlates of
MDD, in this article we also report co-
morbidity with anxiety disorders (panic
disorder,agoraphobiawithoutpanic,so-
cial anxiety disorder, specific phobia,
generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-
compulsive disorder, and posttrau-
maticstressdisorder),substanceusedis-
orders (alcohol and drug abuse and
dependence), and a group of disorders
that we refer to as "impulse-control dis-
orders" (intermittent explosive disor-
der, antisocial personality disorder, bu-
limia, and pathological gambling).
Previous methodological research
documented acceptable-to-good con-
cordance between the NCS/CIDI diag-
noses and blind clinical diagnoses, but
found that the NCS CIDI overdiag-
nosed MDD because of false-positive
assessments of dysphoria and anhedo-
nia.32 The CIDI false-positive assess-
ments included both respondents with
clinically nonsignificant distress and
those whose symptoms did not persist
for most of the day, nearly every day,
or for 2 weeks or longer. The NCS-R
revisions attempted to correct these
problems by including explicit probes
for severity of dysphoria and anhedo-
nia, by requiring clinically significant
distress or impairment associated with
these symptoms, and by asking sepa-
rate questions about symptom dura-
tion (hours per day, days per week, and
duration of depressive episodes).

because they are being assessed in sepa-
rate, in-progress, focused reappraisal
studies. Because of the absence of ma-
nia, the SCID cannot be used to gener-
ate diagnoses of MDD. However, it can
beusedtodiagnosemajordepressiveepi-
sode (MDE). A comparison of the CIDI
and SCID for MDE classifications in the
clinical reappraisal samples (TABLE 2)
shows good concordance for lifetime
(=.59; 95% CI, .47-.71) and fair con-
cordance for 12-month (=.40; 95% CI,

Role Impairment. Respondents with

ministered the Sheehan Disability Scale
(SDS)34 to assess the extent to which de-
pression interfered with functioning in
work, household, relationship, and so-
cial roles in the worst month of the past
year. Responses were scored with a
0-to-10 visual analogue scale having re-
sponse options labeled none (0), mild
(1-3), moderate (4-6), severe (7-9),
and very severe (10). In addition, an
open-ended question asked respon-

in the past 365 days when they were
"totally unable to work or carry out
your normal activities" because of de-
pression.
Allrespondentstopart2oftheNCS-R
completed the WHO disability assess-
ment schedule (WHO-DAS)35 to assess
functional impairments in 6 domains
during the past 30 days: domain 1, the
numberofdaysinthepast30dayswhen
the respondent was completely unable
to work or carry out their normal ac-
tivities because of physical or mental
healthproblems;anddomains2to6,the
severity-persistence of impairments in
5 domains of functioning during the
same time period. These domains in-
clude self-care (eg, bathing, dressing),
mobility (eg, standing, walking), cog-
nition(eg,concentrating,remembering),
socialfunctioning(eg,conversing,main-
taining emotional control while around
others), and role functioning (eg, qual-
ity and quantity of normal activities at
home or work). All 6 WHO-DAS scales
were transformed to a theoretical range
of 0 (no impairment at any time in the
past 30 days) to 1.0 (complete inability
to perform the functions throughout the
full 30 days).
SymptomSeverity.Respondentswho
met CIDI/DSM-IV criteria for 12-
month MDD were self-administered a
truncated version of the Quick Inven-
toryofDepressiveSymptomatologySelf-
Report (QIDS-SR)36 to assess symptom
severity in the worst month of the past
year. The QIDS-SR is a fully structured
measure that is strongly related both to
the clinician-administered Inventory of
DepressiveSymptomology(IDS-C)37 and
to the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depres-
sion(HRSD).38 Transformationrulesde-
veloped for the QIDS-SR39 were used to
convert scores into clinical severity cat-
egories mapped to conventional HRSD
ranges of none (ie, not clinically
depressed), mild, moderate, severe, and
very severe.
12-Month Treatment. All respon-
dents to part 2 of the NCS-R were asked
about receiving 12-month treatment for
emotional problems, the type of profes-
sional seen, as well as use of support
groups, self-help groups, and hotlines.
Number and duration of 12-month vis-
its also were assessed. Responses were
used to classify 12-month treatment in
the specialty mental health (SMH) sec-
tor (inpatient treatment or outpatient
treatment with a psychiatrist, psycholo-
gist, any other mental health profes-
sional, or a social worker or counselor
in a mental health specialty setting, or
use of a hotline), the general medical
(GM) sector (outpatient treatment with
a primary care physician, other medi-
cal specialist, nurse, or any other health
professional not previously mentioned),
the human services (HS) sector (outpa-
tient treatment with a religious or spiri-
tual advisor or with a social worker or
counselorinanysettingotherthanaspe-
cialty mental health setting), and the
complementary-alternative medical
(CAM)sector(outpatienttreatmentwith
any other type of healer, participation
in an internet support group, or partici-
pation in a self-help group). In addi-
tion, a pharmaco-epidemiologic sec-
tion asked respondents about use of
psychotropic medications in the past 12
months. Information was recorded by
having respondents give their medi-
cine bottles to the interviewer to in-
spect and to record the type of medica-
tion, duration of treatment, maximum
prescribed dose, and specialty of pre-
scribing physician.
Based on the above data, minimally
adequate medical treatment for MDD
was defined as receiving either (1) at
least 4 outpatient visits with any type of
physician for pharmacotherapy that in-
cluded use of either an antidepressant
or mood stabilizer for a minimum of 30
days or (2) at least 8 outpatient visits
with any professional in the specialty
mental health sector for psycho-
therapylastingameanofatleast30min-
utes. The decision to require at least 4
pharmacotherapyvisitswasbasedonthe
recommendation from evidence-based
treatment guidelines that no fewer than
4 visits for follow-up and medication
monitoring were required during the
acute and continuation phases of treat-
ment for depression.40,41 At least 8 psy-

ments were classified as not being ad-
equate based on the absence of experi-
mental data documenting effectiveness
in treating MDD. Health care treat-
ment, which was defined as treatment
in either the SMH or GM sectors, was
considered inadequate when this treat-
ment failed to meet either of the above
2 criteria for minimally adequate treat-

care professional, but who never made
a visit to that professional at any time
during those 12 months, were coded as
receiving inadequate health care treat-
ment, but not receiving either inad-
equate SMH or inadequate GM treat-
ment.
Sociodemographics. A standard bat-
tery of sociodemographic variables (eg,
age, sex, employment status, educa-
tion, income) was administered to all
respondents. In addition, sample in-
formation was linked to interview lo-
cation records to classify each respon-
dent by major census region (Northeast,
Midwest, South, and West), and by the
Department of Agriculture's urban-
rural continuum of counties (major
metropolitan counties, other urban-
ized counties, and rural counties).
Interviewer Training
and Field Quality Control
ProfessionallayinterviewersfromtheIn-
stitute for Social Research at the Univer-
sityofMichiganadministeredtheNCS-R.
More than 300 interviewers partici-
pated in the study, each receiving 7 days
of study-specific training and success-
fullycompleting2practiceinterviewsbe-
fore beginning production work. Inter-
views were administered using laptop
computerÂ­assisted software that in-
cluded built-in skip logic, timing flags,
and consistency checks. Regional super-
visors recontacted a random 10% of re-
spondents for quality control.
Five experienced clinical psycholo-
gists administered the clinical reap-
praisal SCID interviews. Each received
80 hours of training and successfully
completed 2 practice interviews before
beginning production work. Inter-
views were conducted by telephone and
were tape recorded with the verbal per-
mission of respondents. Interviewers
wrote extensive notes to justify ratings.
A clinical supervisor reviewed the notes
and reviewed the tape recordings of the
first 10 interviews for each interviewer
plus other tape recordings as needed.
The interviewer or supervisor recon-
tacted the respondent to obtain addi-
tional information when there was am-
biguity about ratings. Biweekly review
meetings were used to prevent inter-
viewer drift.
Statistical Analysis
Cross-tabulations were used to calcu-
late prevalence, comorbidity, symptom
severity, impairment, treatment, and
treatment adequacy. The Kaplan-Meier
method42 was used to generate age-at-
onset curves. Logistic regression analy-
sis43 wasusedtostudydemographiccor-
relates of prevalence and treatment. The
logisticregressioncoefficientsweretrans-
formed to odds ratios (ORs) for ease of
interpretation. Ninety-five percent con-

RESULTS
Prevalence of MDD
The prevalence estimates for CIDI/
DSM-IV MDD in the total NCS-R
sample were 16.2% (95% CI, 15.1-
17.3) for lifetime and 6.6% (95% CI,
5.9-7.3) for the 12 months before the
interview; the ratio of 12-month to life-
time prevalence was approximately
40%. These prevalences were equiva-
lent to national population projec-
tions of 32.6 to 35.1 million US adults
with lifetime MDD and 13.1 to 14.2 mil-
lion with 12-month MDD.
Age-At-Onset of MDD
Kaplan-Meier curves for age-at-onset of
MDD were generated separately for 4
groupsofbirthcohorts(FIGURE)andde-
fined by age at interview (18-29, 30-
44, 45-59, or 60 years). The curves are
significantly different from each other
(2
3
=290.1, P .001 for all). Risk is fairly
low until the early teens, when it be-
ginstoriseinroughlylinearfashionwith
an increasingly steep slope in succes-
sively more recent cohorts.
Sociodemographic Correlates
Either lifetime MDD or 12-month MDD
among lifetime cases was meaning-
fully elevated (ie, statistically signifi-
cant at the .05 level with ORs 1.5)
among respondents in the age range of
18 years to 59 years for lifetime or 18
years to 44 years for 12-month, and for
women (lifetime only), homemakers
(12-month only), respondents who
were classified as "other" in employ-
ment status (consisting mainly of those
who were unemployed or disabled), the
never married (12-month only), the
previously married (lifetime only),
those with less than 12 years of educa-
tion (12-month only), and those liv-
ing in or near poverty (http://aspe
.hhs.gov/poverty/01poverty.htm) (12-
month only). (TABLE 3) Other employ-
ment status, being previously mar-
ried, and low income also were
associated with meaningfully elevated
severe MDD (defined by the QIDS-
SR) among 12-month cases. The preva-
lence of lifetime MDD was meaning-
fully lower (ie, statistically significant
at the .05 level with ORs 0.67) among
people who were retired and Non-
Hispanic blacks than among compari-
son cases, while 12-month MDD was
less likely to be clinically severe in the
Northeast and Midwest than other re-
gions of the country. Major depressive
disorder was largely unrelated to ge-
ography (region of the country or
urbanicity). Despite the large number
of meaningful associations, only a few
were strong (ie, ORs 3.0 or 0.33).

Comorbidity
Nearlythreefourths(72.1%)ofrespon-
dents with lifetime MDD also met the
criteria for at least 1 of the other CIDI/
DSM-IV disorders assessed in the NCS-
R, including 59.2% with anxiety disor-
der,24.0%withsubstanceusedisorder,
and 30.0% with impulse control disor-
der.(TABLE4)Approximatelytwothirds
(64.0%) of respondents with 12-month
MDD met the criteria for at least 1 other
12-month disorder, with anxiety disor-
ders (57.5%) again more common than
either substance use (8.5%) or impulse
control (16.6%) disorders (Table 4).
Comparisonofage-at-onsetreports(Table
4)showsMDDtobetemporallyprimary
to all other comorbid disorders among
12.3%ofrespondentswithlifetimeMDD
and12.6%ofthosewith12-monthMDD.
For lifetime and 12-month MDD, tem-
porally prior MDD was much more
common in relation to substance use
disorders(41.3%and49.2%)thaneither
anxiety (13.7% and 14.6%) or impulse
control (16.9% and 20.8%) disorders.
Role Impairment
of 12-Month MDD
Nearly all (96.9%) respondents with 12-
month MDD reported at least some role
impairment associated with their de-
pression in at least 1 of the 4 SDS role
domains, with 87.4% describing this im-
pairment as at least moderate, 59.3% as
either severe or very severe, and 19.1%
as very severe. (TABLE 5) Impairment
was greatest in the social role domain
(43.4% severe or very severe) and was
least in the work role domain (28.1% se-
vere or very severe).
Respondentswith12-monthMDDre-
ported a mean of 35.2 (95% CI, 26.8-
43.6) days in the past year when they
were totally unable to work or carry out
their normal activities because of their
depression. Overall SDS scores are sig-
nificantly related (F4,617
=17.1, P.001)
to days out of role (Table 5), from a high
of96.5daysamongrespondentswhore-
ported very severe role impairment to
a low of zero among those who re-
ported no role impairment.

Clinical Severity
of 12-Month MDD
More than 99% of respondents with 12-
month CIDI/DSM-IV MDD are inde-
pendently classified by the QIDS-SR as
having been clinically depressed dur-
ing the worst month of the year, with
10.4% mild, 38.6% moderate, 38.0% se-
vere, and 12.9% very severe (TABLE 7).
Mild through severe cases as mea-
sured by QIDS-SR have mean dura-
tions of 13.8 to 16.6 weeks, while very
severe cases have a mean duration of
23.1 weeks (Table 7). Symptom sever-
ity is strongly related both to role im-
pairment and to comorbidity.
12-Month Treatment
Anestimated57.3%ofrespondentswith
12-month MDD received some type of
treatment in the 12 months before their
interview (TABLE 8). The SMH sector
was involved in the highest proportion
of these cases (55.1% of treated cases)
and the HS sector in the lowest propor-
tion(16.0%oftreatedcases),with90.0%
of treated cases seen in the health care
(HC) sectors (SMH, GM, or psycho-
tropic medication use). Treatment met
our criteria for being at least minimally
adequate in 64.3% (95% CI, 55.4-73.1)
of cases in SMH treatment, 41.3% (95%
CI, 31.3-57.2) of cases in GM treat-
ment, and 41.9% (95% CI, 35.9-47.9) in
HC treatment (Table 8). Given that
51.6% (95% CI, 46.1-57.2) of cases re-
ceived HC treatment for their depres-
sion, no more than 21.6% of all respon-

dents with 12-month MDD (ie, 41.9%
of the 51.6% in treatment) received ad-
equate treatment in the year of the in-
terview.
Because there was overlap in sectors
of treatment, we also compared respon-
dents who received SMH, but not GM,
treatment (n=99), among whom 56.2%
(95% CI, 43.7-68.7) received adequate
treatment, with those who received GM,
but not SMH, treatment (n=74), among
whom a significantly lower 9.6% (95%
CI, 6.0-15.5) received adequate treat-
ment (z=6.3, P.001).
Symptom severity is significantly re-
lated to 12-month treatment in both the
SMH sector (2

=13.4, P=.004) and the
GM sector (2
3
=8.1, P=.04), but not in
either the HS sector (2
3
=0.2, P=.97) or
the CAM sector (2
3
=2.6, P=.46). Symp-
tom severity is also significantly re-
lated to patients in the SMH sector re-
ceiving adequate treatment (2
3
=7.9,
P=.048). Even so, fewer than half the
respondents with 12-month very se-
vere MDD (39.1%) and fewer than one
fourth of those with 12-month severe
MDD (24.6%) received adequate 12-
month HC treatment for MDD.

demographic correlates of treatment ad-
equacy also were examined (results not

procedures as in Table 3. None of these
measures was significantly related to ad-

tically for clinical variables.
COMMENT
The NCS-R MDD prevalence esti-
mates are intermediate between the
ECA and NCS estimates. Concor-
dance between CIDI and clinical reap-
praisal diagnoses in the NCS-R is higher
than in previous DIS and CIDI sur-
veys.32,45 In addition, the QIDS-SR con-
firms more than 99% of 12-month CIDI
MDD cases. This improved accuracy is
presumably because of CIDI modifica-
tions in the NCS-R. The lower CIDI
prevalence estimates than those in the
NCS are consistent with the fact that
these modifications operated largely by
reducing false-positive assessments.
The ratio of 12-month CIDI MDD
prevalence to lifetime prevalence being
approximately 40% is broadly consis-
tent with ratios between one third and
one half in previous epidemiologic sur-
veys.46,47 These ratios are consistent with
both retrospective reports in cross-
sectionalcommunitysurveys7,11 andpro-
spective assessments in a small number
of community48,49 and clinical50 samples
in suggesting that MDD is an episodi-
cally chronic recurrent disorder.51
The NCS-R age-at-onset results are
consistent with previous surveys in
finding that MDD has an early onset dis-
tribution.12,46,52 The strong MDD co-
hort effect in NCS-R also is consistent
with previous surveys.13,46,53 Age-
related differential recall, differential
willingness to disclose, or other meth-
odologic factors could play important
parts in this pattern,54,55 although a
genuine increase in the prevalence of
MDD in recent cohorts might have
occurred.56,57

The sociodemographic correlates of
prevalence are for the most part con-
sistent with those of previous epide-
miologic studies,46,58-66 as is the find-
ing that MDD is comorbid with anxiety
and substance use disorders.67,68 Al-
though little epidemiologic evidence is
available about comorbidity between
depression and impulse control disor-
ders among adults, significant comor-
bidity for MDD and impulse control dis-
order has been documented in clinical
studies.69,70 Comorbid impulse con-
trol disorder is often thought to be more
strongly related to bipolar than to uni-
polar depression.71 The NCS-R MDD
impulse control disorder comorbidity
could reflect broader factors or the exis-
tence of what has recently been called
a "soft bipolar spectrum" in which co-
morbid impulse control disorder among
patients with MDD represents a marker
of bipolar susceptibility.72
The finding that comorbid anxiety
disorders typically have an earlier age of
onset than does MDD is consistent with
previousepidemiologicresearch46 aswell
as with prospective family studies of at-
riskchildren.73 Thefindingthatthesame
istrueforcomorbidimpulsecontroldis-
order has not, to our knowledge, been
examined in previous epidemiologic
studies of adults, although the evi-
dence on this point is mixed in studies
of children and adolescents.74
The results regarding MDD impair-
ment are consistent with other evi-
dence that MDD is a seriously impair-
ing condition.75 The 35.1 mean days out
of role because of MDD is striking in
comparison with recent results from an-
other national survey in which mean
time out of role was less than 15 days
for most chronic conditions.76
The QIDS-SR symptom severity re-
sults speak directly to the concern that
prevalence estimates in community sur-
veys might be upwardly biased due to
the inclusion of clinically insignifi-
cant cases.29 This concern is clearly mis-
placed with respect to MDD, as close
to 90% of 12-month CIDI cases are clas-
sified as moderate, severe, or very se-
vere using standard HRSD symptom se-
verity thresholds.
The 57.3% of 12-month MDD cases
who received treatment in the past year,
when multiplied by the estimated 12-
month prevalence of MDD, represents
3.7% of the population. This is a mean-
ingful increase over the 2.1% in the ECA
in the early 1980s and the 2.7% in the
NCS in 1990-1991.14,16 The ratio of
NCS-R to ECA percentages (3.7:2.1)
represents a 37% increase in MDD treat-
ment. This large increase is consistent
with trend data from the National Medi-
cal Expenditures Survey for changes be-
tween 1987 and 1997.18
The NCS-R results are less positive
with regard to treatment adequacy,
implying a need for treatment quality
improvement.77 This improvement will
requirebotharedirectionofpatienthelp-
seeking to sectors where guideline-
concordantcarecanbeprovidedandan

dence-based treatment recommenda-
tions by health care providers.40,41 The
