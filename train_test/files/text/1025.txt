Objectives. Assistive technology (AT) may improve quality of life and reduce dependence for older persons with
disabilities. In this article, we examine tradeoffs between the use of AT and reliance on personal care, with attention to
factors that may influence those relationships.
Methods. We jointly modeled hours of formal and informal care with use of AT in order to address the inter-
dependence of these outcomes in ways not taken into account in previous studies. We analyzed a national sample of older
persons with difficulty in activities of daily living drawn from Phase 2 of the 1994­1995 National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS) Disability Supplement.
Results. Our findings show that the use of AT was associated with reductions in informal care hours, especially for
those who were unmarried, better educated, or had better cognitive abilities, but appeared to supplement formal care
services for these groups. Individuals with cognitive impairment were less likely than others to substitute AT with either
type of personal care.
Discussion. These models raise the possibility that reductions of informal care hours may be accomplished with
a combination of formal care and assistive devices, rather than from either alternative alone.
SEVERAL concurrent population trends, such as declines in
disability and increases in education among the older
population, as well as decreases in the availability of informal
caregivers and a shrinking long-term care workforce (Freed-
man, Martin, & Schoeni, 2002; Wolf, 2001) have led to
discussions of the potential of assistive technology (AT) to
promote independent aging in place. The latter half of the 20th
century saw dramatic growth in AT use by older persons with
disabilities (Manton, Corder, & Stallard, 1993; Norburn et al.,
1995). During the 1980s, the number using any equipment rose
from 3.3 to 4.1 million, and the number relying only on
equipment more than doubled (Manton et al.). By the mid-
1990s, the majority of those with activity of daily living (ADL)
limitations used some form of technology, and almost a third
(31%) used only AT to accommodate their needs (Agree &
Freedman, 2000).
It is hoped that recent increases in the use of AT can improve
quality of life and alleviate pressures on the existing long-term
care system. Recent national studies suggest that technology
may confer unique benefits in reducing difficulty with daily
tasks and unmet need (Agree, 1999; Agree & Freedman, 2003;
Taylor & Hoenig, 2004; Verbrugge, Rennert, & Madans, 1997;
Verbrugge & Sevak, 2002). Yet it remains unclear whether AT
replaces or supplements personal care. Where the use of
assistive technology reduces the amount of personal care
needed, public expenditures on home health care could be
reduced (e.g., Mann, Ottenbacher, Fraas, Tomita, & Granger,
1999) and the burdens of informal care alleviated. Alternatively,
the use of AT in addition to personal services could potentially
improve the quality of care, and thus defer functional declines
and institutionalization, which also would reduce public and
private expenditures.
Prior research on the substitutability of devices for personal
care has been limited in several ways. First, with few
exceptions, studies have used a single metric of care to reflect
substitution. Second, analyses often are limited to mobility
devices (e.g., canes, wheelchairs, walkers). Third, most
research has implicitly assumed that the use of AT precedes
and can predict use of personal care, while in practice such
decisions are not separable.
In this article, we expand upon prior studies in several ways.
First, we consider multiple dimensions of personal care (e.g,
hours, number of caregivers, and number of tasks) for both in-
formal and formal sources of care. Second, rather than focusing
on mobility alone, we examine equipment use for all ADL
activities. Third, we adopt a modeling strategy that allows us to
examine the use of AT and formal and informal care as a
unified set of decisions, without assuming one necessarily pre-
cedes the other. We also focus not only on whether substitution
occurs, but also on which groups have a greater propensity to
replace personal care with technology.

Background
The literature on substitution in long-term care for the older
population has primarily focused on tradeoffs among different
types of personal care in order to address the ``woodwork
effect,'' the concern that public coverage for home care could
cause a reduction in informal care. These studies have been
limited because, although substitution of one type of care for
another is in part a function of the relative cost of each type of
care, information on the price of formal care and assistive
technologies is difficult to obtain and the implicit price of
informal care is difficult to define or measure. A small number
of studies have addressed these issues with experimental data or
state-level variation in home care prices (e.g., Ettner, 1994;
Greene, Lovely, & Ondrich 1993), but the majority define
substitution as a simple replacement of one type of care for
another (e.g., Logan & Spitze, 1994; Soldo, Agree, & Wolf
1989; Tennstedt, Crawford, & McKinlay, 1993), and we
followed this definition in the present analysis. These studies
generally have found that formal home care does not substitute
for (or crowd out) informal care and may, in many cases,
supplement informal care (Kemper, Applebaum, & Harrigan,
1987; Tennstedt et al.; Tennstedt, Harrow, & Crawford, 1996).
Recently, studies of community-based long-term care have
considered substitution between AT and personal care (Agree
& Freedman, 2000; Allen, Foster, & Berg, 2001; de Klerk &
Huijsman, 1996; Hoenig, Taylor, & Sloan, 2003; Mann et al.,
1999). Using an experimental design that randomized about
100 older individuals to assistive devices, Mann and colleagues
found that AT use was associated with lower costs for paid
home care. The study did not address the role of informal care
nor did it explore the mechanism through which costs were
reduced (e.g., fewer visits, shorter visits, different types of
visits). The remaining four studies were based on observational
designs, with three of the four focusing on mobility limitations.
In descriptive analyses, Agree and Freedman (2000) found that
in the United States, simple assistive technology, such as canes,
had the potential to substitute for informal care, while more
complex devices, such as wheelchairs, appeared to supplement
formal care. These relationships held after controlling for the
underlying degree of disability severity. Similarly, de Klerk
and Huijsman found in a sample of older persons from the
Netherlands that the use of mobility aids was positively as-
sociated with the use of home care. Both studies defined sub-
stitution narrowly in terms of a discrete tradeoff between the
use of AT and the receipt of any informal or formal care. In
their analysis of mobility aids, Allen and colleagues considered
a more extensive array of definitions including any formal or
informal care, hours of formal or informal care, number of tasks
for which help was received, and yearly out-of-pocket costs for
formal services. In a series of logistic regression models, they
found the use of canes and crutches inversely related with the
number of tasks and hours of informal and formal care
received; however, no evidence of substitution was found for
wheelchairs and walkers. A fourth study by Hoenig, Taylor,
and Sloan found that AT use for ADL limitations was as-
sociated with fewer hours of help.
Though it has been growing, the existing literature ignores
the highly interdependent nature of decisions about AT and
informal and formal care. This leads to two serious limitations.
First, with the exception of Mann and colleagues (1999),
studies that have modeled the relationship between AT use and
personal care have attempted to predict informal and/or formal
care use as a function of AT use. Such models by definition
assume that decisions about AT precede decisions about
personal care, which is rarely the case in practice. For example,
a recent widow may use adaptive equipment to compensate for
the loss of her informal caregiver. Additionally, formal
providers, such as nursing aides or rehabilitation therapists,
often will bring AT into an older individual's home as a part of
their service package (Gitlin & Levine, 1992). Second, these
studies have focused on whether substitution is occurring, with
no attention to differences in the ability to substitute AT for
personal care. For example, those with cognitive impairment
may not be able to trade off technology for human assistance.
Moreover, AT can substitute for formal or informal care in
a number of ways. For example, a cane or walker might alleviate
the need for any personal care by allowing an individual to
ambulate independently. Adding grab bars to the shower may
enable older persons to shower safely on their own, thereby
reducing the hours of care or the number of caregivers needed,
or freeing caregivers to use the extra time to turn their attention
to other tasks, such as paying medical bills, shopping, or
cooking. In the last case, the total amount of care (in terms of
personnel or hours) may remain the same, but the tasks with
which they assist may change.
In this article we expand upon prior studies in two ways: First,
rather than limiting our analysis to a single dimension of per-
sonal care, we consider four distinct dimensions: 1) whether any
informal and formal care is received; 2) the number of informal
caregivers; 3) the hours of informal and formal care received;
and 4) the number of ADL and instrumental ADL (IADL) tasks
for which informal and formal care is received. Second, unlike
most previous studies that have been limited to mobility
limitations, we consider the care options (informal and formal
care and the use of AT) for any of six ADL activities. Third, we
employ a statistical method that allows us to examine the use of
formal and informal care services and AT without assuming the
order in which they are acquired. The article is organized as
follows: After providing a description of the data, we compare
AT users and nonusers to examine descriptively how assistive
technology may substitute for personal care use across the four
dimensions described above. We then present models that
consider the use of AT and hours of formal and informal care
jointly in order to identify who is most likely to use AT in place
of or in addition to personal care services. Finally, we discuss
implications of our findings for future research.
METHODS
Data
This research used the 1994­1995 Phase 2 Supplement on
Disability to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS-D2).
The NHIS Disability supplements were conducted as a follow-
up to the 1994 and 1995 National Health Interview Surveys.
Phase 1 was conducted at the time of the core interview with
a designated respondent who answered questions for all related
household members. Phase 2 was administered to persons who
screened in as disabled from information in Phase 1 (defined as
having any pathology, impairment limitation, or disability).
RECONSIDERING SUBSITITUTION S273
This definition was sufficiently broad to include almost 50% of
those aged 70 years and older. Phase 2 addressed disability
issues in more detail than Phase 1 and included information on
health insurance, transportation needs, housing and other
environmental barriers, and family structure and relations.
Sample Selection
Our analytic sample comprised 4,006 persons aged 65 years
and older who reported underlying difficulty with one or more
of seven ADLs (bathing or showering, dressing, eating, getting
in and out of bed or chairs, walking, getting outside, and using
the toilet). For each activity respondents were asked how well
they were able to do them by themselves and without special
equipment. We limit our focus to the use of care for ADLs
because these tasks have been shown to be more responsive
than IADLs to the use of assistive devices (LaPlante, Hender-
shot, & Moss, 1992; Norburn et al., 1995; Sohn & Grimby,
1994; Zimmer & Chappell, 1994). They also are far less likely
to be subject to the lifelong abilities and expectations built into
social roles, especially by gender (Allen, 1994). We do not
focus on sensory impairments such as hearing and vision
limitations for two reasons. First, while these abilities are
important in accomplishing ADLs and using equipment, they
are not activities in and of themselves. Second, the NHIS-D
collected no information on personal care for them.
Dependent Variables: AT and Personal Care Use
AT use. --For each ADL, participants were asked if they used
special equipment and to name the specific item(s) used. The
most common items mentioned were canes, bath seats, walkers,
bath rails, and wheelchairs (see Table 1). Altogether 63.8% of
respondents reported using at least one of these five devices.
The majority of AT was used for mobility-related activities
(walking, transferring, and going outside), and mobility devices
often were used for more than one activity, including toileting,
which has a mobility component. AT was also commonly used
for bathing; almost one quarter of the sample reported using
rails or grab bars. In order to maintain the power of the models,
and because not every AT user identified their devices by name,
our measure of assistive technology use is a dichotomous
indicator of whether a respondent uses any special equipment.
Personal care use. --Respondents were asked if they
received hands-on help for each ADL activity and if so to
identify up to four people who help them. For each helper,
respondents provided information on the tasks with which the
caregiver provides help, the number of hours they provided care
in the last two weeks, and the relationship of the caregiver.
Personal care is classified as either formal care (defined as a paid
provider or an unpaid volunteer or employee of a formal
organization) or informal care (unpaid care provided by relatives
or friends.)
Drawing upon our multiple definitions of substitution, we
created indicators for the following dimensions of personal
care: First, we created a dichotomous indicator for whether or
not the respondent used any informal or formal care in the last
two weeks. Second, we represented the size of the care network
by a dichotomous variable indicating whether respondents used
two or more informal caregivers. We used the number of
informal rather than formal caregivers because most secondary
caregivers were informal. Third, we created a set of indicators
for the number of hours of care provided by informal and
formal caregivers in the past two weeks. In a number of cases,
hours of care were incomplete or missing for one or more
caregivers. For 1,139 respondents, we imputed information on
hours of care for one or more helpers. We assigned informal
caregivers with missing information the average number of
hours of care provided by caregivers matched by sex (male,
female, or unknown), network size (1, 2þ), and position
(primary, secondary). For formal care providers, we used
network size and position only. Finally, to explore whether care
hours were shifted to alternative tasks, we counted the number
of ADL and IADL tasks for which formal and informal help
was received.
Independent Variables
We included four sets of variables, which have been shown
in previous research to be related to use of AT and informal
and/or formal care, into the models: health needs, resources,
access, and demographic characteristics.
Health Needs. --The primary factor determining the nature
and amount of care used is the extent of underlying health
needs. In this study, health needs were measured by 1) the
number of ADL limitations with which the respondent reported
severe underlying difficulty and 2) the presence of extensive
cognitive impairment. The first measure was obtained from
questions about the amount of difficulty respondents had with
each ADL when they were not using any special equipment or
personal assistance. Those who reported that they had a lot of
difficulty or were unable to do the task without assistance were
considered to have a ``severe'' limitation with that activity. The
reference group in our models consisted of respondents who
reported some difficulty with one or more ADL tasks but who
did not report ``severe'' difficulty with any ADLs.
Because measures of cognitive impairment in the NHIS-D
were extremely limited we employed an indicator of whether
a proxy respondent was used due to ``poor memory, senility,

and confusion'' or because the respondent ``had Alzheimer's
disease.'' This measure identified only the most severely
cognitively impaired respondents and excluded more mildly
cognitively impaired individuals who were able to respond to
the interview themselves.
Resources. --The choice of care arrangement depends in part
upon the economic and familial resources available to the older
person. In this analysis we included measures of insurance,
poverty, and kin availability. To represent insurance coverage,
we included a three-category indicator: Medicare only, dually
eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and Medicare and private
supplemental insurance. Those with other health insurance,
typically government veterans insurance, were included with
the Medicare only group as fewer than 3% of respondents were
in this category. We represent poverty status with a three-
category variable: below poverty (, 100% of the poverty line),
near poverty (100­200% of poverty), or above poverty
(. 200% of poverty). In addition to these categories, we
used a separate category to indicate those individuals whose
income was unknown (about 20% of our sample). With respect
to kin availability, we included indicators representing marital
status (currently married vs not currently married) and the
number of living daughters both in and outside the household.
We also examined number of living sons, brothers, and sisters,
but found in preliminary analyses that these factors had little
effect on either AT use or personal care.
Access. --Access to technology and formal care can be
measured by availability and by price. Because information on
the price of AT is not widely available, here we focused on two
indicators: acute care use and urban location. Many older
persons are first introduced to the use of a device in the hospital
or through prescription by a physician (Gitlin, 1995), and ar-
rangements for home health care are commonly made upon
hospital discharge, when Medicare will pay for these services.
Contact with medical providers also may lead to use of a formal
care manager, who would be more knowledgeable about both
formal home care and appropriate AT. Thus, although imper-
fect, we represented the availability of these care options in our
models by hospitalization and physician visits in the prior year.
Geographic location often is used as a proxy for availability
of and accessibility to services such as health care (e.g., Krout
1983), but there are inconsistencies in the literature related to
rural­urban residence and service utilization. We examined the
contrasts between nonurban and urban residential location,
where urban areas are cities with more than 250,000 resi-
dents, and nonurban areas are localities with fewer than
250,000 residents.
Demographic characteristics. --We also included four de-
mographic characteristics previously shown to be related to care
arrangements: age, gender, education, and race and ethnicity.
We classified age categorically as a distinction between those
aged 65­74 and those aged 75 and older. Race and ethnicity
were represented by a single indicator of whether the respondent
was White or non-White because few respondents from other
backgrounds are included in the sample.
Modeling Approach and Interpretation
We first examine the bivariate relationships between AT use
and the four measures of personal care to determine where
potential substitution of AT for personal care exists. Based on
these results, multivariate analyses focus on the relationship
between AT use and the hours of informal and formal care
received in the last two weeks.
Following prior analyses of substitution between formal and
informal personal care (e.g., Greene, 1983), we assume that
formal and informal care and AT are not acquired in any
particular order, as decisions regarding care tend to be idio-
syncratic and interdependent. That is, we assume that accom-
modating one's care needs is not necessarily done sequentially
(e.g., first choosing a piece of technology and then determining
the type of caregiver and hours needed, or vice versa) but rather
may occur in any possible order, or simultaneously (for ex-
ample, upon discharge from hospital). The lack of recognition of
this interdependence in previous research has often led to
misspecification in other analyses with cross-sectional data.
There is a body of statistical methods that have been developed
to simultaneously estimate equations for interdependent out-
comes (e.g., indirect regression, two [and three] stage least
squares, instrumental variables, and full and limited information
maximum likelihood models). Economists most commonly
apply instrumental variable techniques to identify the set of
equations. However, in the absence of plausible instruments,
we have opted for a reduced-form modeling approach in which
the three outcomes are estimated as functions of the same
combination of exogenous health, resource, access, and de-
mographic factors.
The dependent variables for the equations representing our
three outcomes included a dichotomous (0, 1) variable for AT
use and continuous variables truncated at 0 for both informal
care and formal care. We assume that the error terms for the
three equations come from a correlated trivariate normal dis-
tribution. Therefore, we jointly estimated a Probit equation for
AT use along with two Tobit equations for the two hours-of-
care variables. Correlations between pairs of the three error
terms (designated by the Greek symbol q [rho]) represents the
relationships between the relevant pairs of care alternatives net
of characteristics included in the model. We obtained parameter
estimates with aML software (Lillard and Panis, 2003).
Although this approach does not allow comparisons across
specific items of AT (because each would require its own
equation), it offers the advantage of identifying characteristics
associated with the substitution of AT for formal and informal
hours of care. In other words, we were able to identify factors
that increased the likelihood of using AT while decreasing the
hours of either informal or formal services used. Consequently,
we consider the combination of a positive (and statistically
significant) coefficient in the AT equation with a negative (and
statistically significant) coefficient in the informal care and/or
the formal care equations to indicate substitution. The q
parameters also may be interpreted as indicating substitution
between a pair of outcomes when the parameter estimate is
negative (and statistically significant); in this case, however, the
factors associated with the substitution remain unmeasured. In
contrast, significantly positive coefficients in the AT equation
and the formal hours or informal hours equations, along with
positive q parameters, indicate complementarity of the two

types of assistance. We estimated one-tailed significance tests
to test for a specific effect direction.
RESULTS
We present the general characteristics of the sample in Table
2. The table shows the sample relatively evenly distributed by
severity of ADL disability, though only about 14% used a proxy
for cognitive reasons. Most (65%) were covered by Medicare
and supplemental insurance, and about 20% were classified as in
poverty. The majority were not married (60%), and more than
two thirds had daughters. Less than half had seen a doctor two
times in the last 3 months, and only about 30% had been to the
hospital in the past year. Most of the sample (72%) resided in
urban areas. In terms of demographic characteristics, slightly
more than half of the sample was aged 75 years or older, more
than 85% were White, about two thirds were female, and about
half had not completed high school.
Comparisons show that AT users received more personal
care than nonusers on all four measures of personal care (Table
3). They were more likely to use any formal and informal care,
to have two or more caregivers, and to use more hours of both
formal and informal care on average. Those who used AT also
received help with significantly more ADL tasks and received
both informal and formal care with a greater number of IADLs
than respondents who did not use AT. At first glance these
findings suggest complementarity, rather than substitution,
between AT and other forms of assistance.
These results do not, however, control for the accumulation of
increasing amounts and types of assistance at greater levels of
disability. To control for this potentially confounding effect, in
Table 4 we stratify the estimates by underlying severity of
disability. For most of the personal care measures the results
are largely unchanged. Across all the measures considered in
this table, AT appears to supplement both formal and informal
care. The one exception to this general pattern is among those
with the most severe ADL limitations, for whom AT use was
associated with fewer hours of informal care and more hours
of formal care (yielding a lower number of total personal care
hours). However, because they did not receive help for sig-
nificantly fewer ADL tasks, this does not appear to be a shift of
care from ADL to IADL tasks. In fact, they reported receiving
significantly more formal care for both ADL and IADL tasks.
These descriptive tables suggest that AT may substitute for
informal care hours at higher levels of disability. However, they
do not take into account other covariates that may affect the
relationship between AT and personal care. Additionally, it
may be that correlations among the three outcomes related to
unmeasured characteristics influenced the observed relation-
ships. To further explore these possibilities and to identify who
is more likely to substitute AT for personal care hours, we
estimated our multivariate models.
Results presented in Table 5 provide some initial insight into
which groups of respondents were most likely to use assistive
technology either instead of or in addition to formal and
informal care. The basic complementarity of AT and personal
care is confirmed for those of advancing age and with more
severe ADL disabilities, which were associated with increases
in all three types of care. In addition, those with two or more
doctor visits in the past 3 months showed increases in both use
of AT and hours of informal care, and those that had any
hospitalizations in the last year were both more likely to use AT
and more formal care hours.
Only three factors show patterns consistent with the use of AT
as a substitute for personal care. For those who were unmarried
and those with more than a high school education, AT appears to
trade off informal hours and complement formal care hours.
Both groups were more likely to use AT than married and less
educated persons, respectively, and also use fewer informal care
hours. However, our models also show that these respondents

used more formal care hours, even after controlling for addi-
tional covariates, indicating a complementarity between AT and
formal services. The second pattern of substitution is related to
cognitive capacity. Those with reduced cognitive capacity were
more likely than others to supplement AT with both types of
personal care; stated another way, those with reduced cognitive
capacity were less likely than others to substitute AT with either
type of personal care.
Several other variables included in the model produced
statistically significant results for formal or informal hours, or
both, but insignificant results for AT (and vice-versa). For ex-
ample, individuals living in nonurban areas were significantly
less likely to use AT but were not statistically different from
those dwelling in urban areas with respect to either formal or
informal hours of help. Such findings indicate a reallocation of
assistive services, compared to the reference group, but do not
meet our criterion for service substitution because the increase
(or decrease) in the likelihood of using AT was not offset by
a decrease (or increase, respectively) in use of help from others.
Net of the effects of the variables included in the models, the q
parameters indicate that AT use had a small positive correlation
with informal care hours (q ¼ .05) and a moderate positive as-
sociation with formal care hours (q ¼ .15). Informal and formal
care hours were negatively related (q ¼ À.13), which is con-
sistent with prior research on personal long-term care services.
DISCUSSION
In this article, we explored the interdependence of AT and
informal and formal care use by older people. Unlike previous
studies, we also identified factors that influence the propensity to
use AT as a substitute for or complement to personal services. In
our analyses, we examined several dimensions of personal care
in order to better identify the nature of substitution between AT
and formal and informal personal care. Overall, these findings
show that, regardless of the measure of substitution, AT is not
replacing formal or informal care for most older persons living
with disabilities in the community. Instead AT use appears to
supplement personal care--it is associated with a higher prob-
ability of using both informal and formal care, more care-
givers and more care hours, and the receipt of assistance with
more tasks.
We also found that for some groups (e.g., unmarried persons
and those with some college education) AT and formal care
together seem to offset informal care hours. However, because
the coefficients for both AT and formal care hours are positive, it
is possible that formal care and AT substitute for different tasks
or at different times and that informal caregivers cannot reduce
their hours unless both are present in the care arrangement. This
finding also underscores the importance of jointly considering
AT with both informal and formal care sources in order to
understand the long-term care decision process.
Results also indicate that those with worse cognitive capacity
are less likely to substitute the use of AT for both formal and
informal personal care hours. It is not surprising that these
respondents would be less able to substitute AT for caregiver
time, as the use of devices for physical disabilities requires some
cognitive ability. This result may be a conservative estimate of
the effect of cognitive abilities on the propensity to substitute,
however, as our measure of cognition distinguishes only be-
tween those with the most severe cognitive impairment (who
were unable to be interviewed and for whom proxy responses
were obtained) and all others. As many as 5­7% of those
who self-report could have had severe cognitive impairment
(Freedman, Aykan, & Martin, 2001), and an unknown addi-
tional number might have had mild to moderate impairments in
cognitive function. Use of a more refined measure should, in
theory, yield even greater distinctions by cognitive status, but
this relationship requires further investigation.
These findings substantiate prior research showing that AT
substitutes for informal care, at least for some groups (Agree &
Freedman 2000; Allen et al. 2001; Hoenig, Taylor, and Sloan
2003), and that AT supplements formal care (Agree and
Freedman 2000; de Klerk and Huijsman 1996). However, our
results differ from Allen and colleagues (2001), who concluded

RECONSIDERING SUBSITITUTION S277
(using the same data) that use of canes substituted for hours of
formal care. Reconciling the inconsistency in findings will
require further analysis, as the two studies employ different
inclusion criteria, modeling strategies, and treatment of the
cognitively impaired.
Our study is limited in several respects. First, we use cross-
sectional data and thus are unable to directly examine the order
in which each type of assistance was adopted. Nevertheless, we
improve upon past studies because our analytic models do not
impose a priori any temporal order between AT and personal
care as previous research has done. A second limitation is that
we were unable in this study to distinguish among specific types
of devices or between simple and complex technologies, though
other research has shown these distinctions to be important
(Agree & Freedman, 2000; Allen, 2001). Using a dichotomous
indicator for AT may limit our ability to recognize task-specific
cases of substitution or supplementation because we summarize
care at the person level instead of the activity level. Further
research at a more refined level of detail would give greater
meaning to our findings and better suggest clinically relevant
interventions to improve home-based long-term care. Finally,
although we control for reported limitations in health and under-
lying severity in functioning, we cannot fully capture all of the
effects of declining health on long-term care decisions. Conse-
quently, there may remain some residual relationship among the
three outcomes that is due to unobserved health factors.
Despite these limitations, this study provides important in-
sights into the potential for technology to improve the daily
lives of older disabled persons. We find, for example, that the
reduced informal care hours cannot be attributed solely to AT,

but rather may be due to the combination of formal care and
assistive devices. The association between these types of care
suggests that potential improvements in care management could
be made through increased use of care managers or provision of
information about AT to health care providers. This finding also
underscores the need for caution in pointing to AT as a means
of offsetting care costs for the older disabled population. Ulti-
mately such devices may improve the quality of life of older
persons and promote independence; however, their ability to
substitute for more expensive formal care is not yet established.
Finally, our results point to three groups--those who are
unmarried, those with at least some college education, and those
with little or no cognitive impairment--as being most likely to
substitute AT for personal care. Better education may be
associated with increased receptivity to AT and thus facilitate
the adoption of it into one's care network. Unmarried persons,
because they most often live alone, may by necessity use AT to
carry out their daily activities. While it is difficult to predict
trends in marital status, over the next decades the educational
attainment of older persons will increase dramatically (Freed-
man & Martin, 1999). All else equal, our analysis suggests that
this trend will promote substitution of technology for hands-on
informal care. Why these groups use AT in place of informal
care, whether doing so confers a benefit, and if so, how best to
encourage use for other groups are fruitful areas for further
research on care for the elderly.
