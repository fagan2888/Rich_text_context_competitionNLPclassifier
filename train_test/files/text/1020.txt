tural and ethnic influences on mental disorders. They
incorporate a more sophisticated depiction of impair-
ment, disability and service patterns, and greater
integration of mental and medical disorders. They will
also facilitate an in-depth examination of factors
contributing to psychopathology and service use dis-
parities. The growing links between psychiatric
epidemiology, clinical research and services research
suggest that the findings that emerge from the CPES
will influence phenomenology, etiology, and treatment
research as well as public health and services policy.
The first two papers in this issue introduce two
surveys in the CPES that focus on minority popula-
tions: the National Survey of American Life (NSAL)
(Jackson et al., 2004) and the National Latino and
Asian American Study (NLAAS) (Alegria et al.,
2004). The NSAL is a study designed to explore racial
and ethnic differences in mental disorders, distress and
service use from within the context of a variety of pre-
sumed risk and protective factors in the African
American and Afro-Caribbean populations of the US
as compared with white respondents living in the same
communities. In addition to the core disorder instru-
mentation contained in all of the CPES surveys, the
NSAL has included detailed measures of health and
social conditions, many of them similar to measures
used in the National Survey of Black Americans con-
ducted in 1970­80 and thus a source of trend data for
African-Americans over the past generation. Jackson
and his colleagues highlight the incongruencies in the
literature regarding differences between blacks and
whites in vulnerability and mental disorder rates. The
large sample size of the NSAL (over 6,000 adult
respondents) will allow this research team to tease out
explanations for the disparate and oft-times counter-
intuitive relationships between distress, quality of life
indicators, socioeconomic status and mental disorders
reported previously.
Next, Alegria and Takeuchi (Alegria et al., 2004)
present the NLAAS, the first study of its kind to mea-
sure psychiatric epidemiology and service utilization
Guest editorial
As the methods of psychiatric epidemiology have
reached a greater level of sophistication, the field of
descriptive epidemiology has begun to reach maturity
(Eaton and Merikangas, 2002). Worldwide prevalence
estimates of mental disorders are now available, as well
as their sociodemographic correlates, service patterns,
and associated disability. Perhaps the most important
finding from psychiatric epidemiology research is that
aggregate mental disorders are the most prevalent of
all chronic diseases in the general population. Indeed,
four of the top 10 causes of disability worldwide are
mental disorders. Moreover, depression has now sur-
passed cardiovascular disease as the leading cause of
disability worldwide (World Health Report, 2002).
Despite major advances in the recognition and treat-
ment of mental disorders during the past decade, the
vast majority of people with mental disorders in the
US still do not receive adequate services (Kessler et
al., 2003).
The NIMH Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology
Surveys (CPES) were initiated in recognition of the
need for contemporary, comprehensive epidemiologi-
cal data regarding the distributions, correlates and risk
factors of mental disorders among the general popula-
tion with special emphasis on minority groups. This
project joins three nationally representative surveys ­
the National Comorbidity Survey Replication
(NCS-R); the National Survey of American Life
(NSAL) and the National Latino and Asian American
Study (NLAAS) ­ via a core interview structure that
was used across each of the studies. Previous publica-
tions have provided detailed descriptions of the
methods of the NCS-R (Kessler et al., 2004), a replica-
tion survey of the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS)
conducted a decade ago (Kessler et al., 1994).
The CPES initiative has allowed the NIMH to
establish a twenty-first century benchmark of the dis-
tribution and correlates of mental disorder prevalence,
associated impairments and mental health service use
patterns across the US. The studies provide the first
national data with sufficient power to investigate cul-

among Latinos and Asian-Americans using a nation-
ally representative sampling frame. Recognizing that
language barriers may discourage survey participation
for minorities who do not speak English, or are not
fluent in it, the NLAAS instrument was translated
into seven languages. In addition to enriched samples
of US residents of Latino and Asian descent, this study
includes modules that will permit an in-depth analysis
of cultural influences on disorder manifestations and
service use patterns.
The third paper in this supplement by Pennell and
her associates (Pennell et al., 2004) is one of the most
comprehensive descriptions of survey fieldwork ever to
be published in a journal supplement. This `soup to
nuts' description serves multiple purposes. First, it
underscores the elaborate planning and coordination
involved in conducting these surveys. Next, it
describes triumphs and adversities, as well as the
survey methodology theory and techniques used to
address issues as they were confronted. This project
had its challenges. Pennell and her colleagues do an
excellent job of walking the reader through the 5-year
process that led, ultimately, to the successful comple-
tion of over 20,000 CPES interviews. While the focus
of this paper is on the adult portion of the project, the
reader may keep in mind that a comprehensive study
of adolescents and a 10-year follow-back study of origi-
nal respondents of the National Comorbidity Survey
(NCS) were being conducted in conjunction with
these adult surveys. Finally, this paper provides the
field with an up-to date account of the challenges con-
ducting household surveys in a post 9/11 America.
Heeringa and his colleagues (Heeringa et al., 2004)
have carefully described the sampling designs and
methods for the CPES in the fourth paper. While the
goal of each of the studies was to be nationally repre-
sentative, the strategies used to meet that goal were
tailored to each study according to its sample require-
ments. Also described are the responsive design
techniques that were used to further refine the studies
once they were in the field. The end result is an
account of the application of state of the art in survey
methodology practically in `real time' as the surveys
have only recently been completed. Thus, the infor-
mation contained therein will be useful to researchers
and statisticians who may use CPES data and as a tuto-
rial for students of survey methodology.
The last two papers in this issue are a preview of
some of the methodology work done by the individual
study teams from within the context of the NSAL and
the NLAAS. Alegria et al. (2004b) describe the
process the study team undertook to attain cultural rel-
evance, equivalence and consistency among the scales
used in the non-core sections of the survey instrument.
Jackson and his team (2004b) describe methodological
approaches that address sampling challenges con-
fronted when household members reside in
institutional settings; a test of the consistency with
which survey items were interpreted among respon-
dents from the various cultures studied; and a method
for efficient collection of family history data. They also
include a brief description of the clinical reappraisal
study that was embedded in the NSAL design to cali-
brate the survey (layperson administered) generated
disorder diagnoses with diagnoses generated from a
structured clinical interview (administered by a
mental health clinician).
Although this work is comprised solely of sites within
the US, there will be greater integration of psychiatric
epidemiology at the international level with the emer-
gence of global initiatives in health. Moreover, as
exemplified by the fields of cancer and cardiovascular
epidemiology, current studies are increasingly incorpo-
rating biological and genetic risk factors with emerging
knowledge regarding their role in mental disorders. We
anticipate having a prominent role in expanding the
context of epidemiology to meet the needs and chal-
lenges of psychiatric science. The CPES initiative is a
groundbreaking step into the future.
