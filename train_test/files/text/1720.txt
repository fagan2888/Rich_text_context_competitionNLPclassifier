Background and objectives: The objective of this study was to describe the normal range of serum cystatin C and identify
factors associated with variability in serum cystatin C contrasting with factors that are known to influence creatinine levels
in the general US adolescent population.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements: Serum cystatin C and creatinine were measured in 719 participants aged 12
to 19 yr in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a national cross-sectional survey conducted in 1988
through 1994. We calculated gender- and race/ethnicity-specific cystatin C and creatinine ranges and conducted multivariable
linear regression analyses to assess factors that contribute to variability in cystatin C and creatinine levels.
Results: Overall, the mean serum cystatin C level was 0.84 mg/L and was higher in male than female individuals and higher
in non-Hispanic white versus non-Hispanic black and Mexican American individuals. The mean serum creatinine was 0.71
mg/dl and was higher in male than in female individuals but lower in non-Hispanic white and Mexican American compared
with non-Hispanic black individuals. Unlike creatinine, which increases with age from 12 to 19 yr, cystatin C levels decrease,
particularly in female individuals. After adjustment for age, gender, and race/ethnicity, uric acid and blood urea nitrogen were
significantly associated with cystatin C levels.
Conclusions: Serum cystatin C is significantly related to gender, age, race/ethnicity, uric acid, and blood urea nitrogen in
adolescents.

Serum creatinine is the most common marker of kidney
function used in clinical practice. Nonetheless, the lim-
itations of using serum creatinine as a kidney function
measure are well documented (1,2). In particular, the produc-
tion of creatinine is highly affected by dietary intake and mus-
cle mass, which itself varies by age, height, gender, and race/
ethnicity. In children, the use of creatinine to assess kidney
function is further complicated by changing muscle mass,
which influences the circulating creatinine concentration (3) as
children grow. Serum cystatin C, a product of an endogenous
"housekeeping" gene thought to be produced at a constant rate,
is a novel marker of kidney function that has been suggested to
be able to overcome some of the age and body size limitations
of serum creatinine as a marker of kidney function (4,5). Cys-
tatin C has been proposed by several groups and a recent
meta-analysis to be a more sensitive and specific marker of
kidney function in both children and adults (6­9).
Little is known, however, about the normal ranges for cys-
tatin C in a diverse, healthy pediatric population and which
factors contribute to variability in levels. Cystatin C levels are
highest within the first few days of life (presumably reflecting
the physiologic low GFR in newborns) but normalize by age 1
and have been reported to remain constant throughout adult-
hood up to age 50 (10). In the existing literature, proposed
ranges for the serum concentration of cystatin C in pediatric
populations are inconsistent, with several small, single-institu-
tion, hospital- or clinic-based studies reporting reference ranges
that have varied widely between 0.58 and 1.38 mg/dl (10­13).
In addition, reported cystatin C ranges are affected by use of
different cystatin C assays (4). These are important limitations
to the use of cystatin C in routine assessment of kidney func-
tion. Furthermore, some previous studies suggested that cysta-
tin C levels are independent of gender, age, or body composi-
tion (14­16), whereas others showed differences in cystatin C
levels according to demographic characteristics, adiposity, thy-
roid function, and inflammation (17­20). It is unknown
whether factors such as gender, age, race, adiposity, thyroid
function, and inflammation affect cystatin C levels in the nor-
mal adolescent population.
The objective of this study was to establish the range of
cystatin C levels in a nationally representative adolescent sam-

ple and to examine whether cystatin levels are indeed indepen-
dent of age, gender, and race in a general population of ado-
lescents. To accomplish this, we analyzed serum cystatin C and
serum creatinine data from participants aged 12 to 19 yr in the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III). We directly contrast the associations between
demographic factors and serum cystatin C to the widely known
associations between age, gender, and race and serum creati-
nine in adolescents.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
NHANES III is a cross-sectional survey conducted between 1988 and
1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics. NHANES III used a
complex, multistage, clustered sampling design to provide nationally
representative data on the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population
(21). As part of a National Institutes of Health­funded study, serum
cystatin C was measured on all NHANES III participants who were
60 yr old and had serum creatinine measured, as well as a 25%
random sample of those aged 12 to 59 yr (22). The younger age group
was supplemented by sampling all individuals with high standard
serum creatinine (1.189 mg/dl in male individuals and 0.997 mg/dl
in female individuals). In this analysis, we analyzed data available from
all NHANES III participants who were aged 12 to 19 yr and for whom
serum cystatin C had been measured (n  719; 337 male and 382 female
individuals, 10 of whom had high standard serum creatinine [nine male
individual and one female individual]).
Data Collection and Measurement
Serum samples were stored at 70°C until 2006 when cystatin C was
measured at the Cleveland Clinic Research Laboratory. Cystatin C was
measured using the Dade Behring N Latex Cystatin C assay, which is
an automated particle-enhanced immunonephelometric assay run on
the Dade Behring Nephelometer II (Dade Behring, Deerfield, IL). The
interassay coefficients of variation for the assay were 5.05 and 4.87% at
mean concentrations of 0.97 and 1.90 mg/L, respectively. This assay is
currently the most precise automated assay across the clinical concen-
tration range (4).
Serum creatinine was measured by the modified kinetic Jaffe reaction
using a Hitachi 737 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).
Serum creatinine values were calibrated to standard creatinine using an
enzymatic creatinine assay traceable to liquid chromatography-isotope
dilution gas chromatography mass spectrometry reference method at
the Cleveland Clinic Research Laboratory using the following equation:
Standardized serum creatinine (mg/dl)  0.184  0.96 * [original
NHANES III serum creatinine (mg/dl)] (23­25).
Detailed information regarding data collection in NHANES III has
been published previously (26). Ethnicity was categorized as non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, and other.
Estimates for the last category are not presented because of small
sample size and heterogeneity within this group (27). Measured weight
and height were used to generate categories of underweight (5% body
mass index [BMI] for age), normal weight (5 to 85% BMI for age), at risk
for overweight (85 to 95% BMI for age), and overweight (95% BMI for
age) using gender-specific BMI-for-age growth percentiles (28). The
percentage of body fat (%BF) and free fat mass (FFM) were calculated
using data obtained from bioelectric impedance analysis, gender, and
weight (29). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was categorized (0.22,
0.22 to 1.0, or 1 mg/dl) as normal, borderline elevated, or elevated
(30). Tanner stage of pubic hair development was available only for
male and female individuals who were 8 to 18 yr of age and available
for 75.5% of the study population.
Statistical Analysis
For accounting for the complex sampling design of NHANES III and
for generation of estimates that are representative of the US adolescent
population aged 12 to 19 yr, all analysis were conducted using the Stata
svy commands (StataCorp release 10.0, College Station, TX), which
incorporated the appropriate sampling weights for the cystatin C sub-
population (22). For continuous variables, the mean  SEM is reported;
for categorical variables, we examined the proportion of individuals in
each category. The adjusted Wald test was used to compare means. P 
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
We determined the distribution of serum cystatin C and creatinine in
the overall study population and generated age-, race-, and gender-
specific percentiles. We conducted univariable and multivariable linear
regression analyses to evaluate factors influencing cystatin C and cre-
atinine levels. In multivariable modeling, biologically plausible vari-
ables, including gender, age, and race/ethnicity, as well as potential
correlates previously described (16­19) as associated with serum cys-
tatin C levels were maintained in the model when they were significant
with at P  0.05.
The protocols for conducting this study were approved by the insti-
tutional review boards of the National Center for Health Statistics and
the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Informed con-
sent was obtained from all participants during the survey.
Results
Table 1 shows the demographics of the sample and nation-
ally representative estimates of selected characteristics, overall
and by gender for the 12- to 19-yr-old US population included
in NHANES III. The study population represents a generally
healthy adolescent US population with 3% having self-re-
ported comorbidities such as hypertension or hyperlipidemia
or laboratory evidence of inflammation with elevated CRP or
white blood cell count. The distributions of serum cystatin C
and standardized serum creatinine, stratified by gender, are
shown in Figure 1. The distributions seem close to normally
distributed, but cystatin C has a narrower distribution than
serum creatinine and creatinine is slightly more skewed toward
higher values. For both cystatin C and serum creatinine, the
overall distribution is shifted to lower values for female com-
pared with male individuals. In the US adolescent population
12 to 19 yr of age, the mean serum cystatin C level was 0.84
mg/L (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83 to 0.86) and was sig-
nificantly higher in male compared with female individuals
(0.89 versus 0.79 mg/L; P  0.001). On average, male individ-
uals had serum cystatin C levels that were 12.7% higher than
those for female individuals. The mean serum creatinine level
was 0.72 mg/dl (95% CI 0.70 to 0.73) and was also significantly
higher in male compared with female individuals (0.77 versus
0.66 mg/dl; P  0.001). On average, male individuals had
serum creatinine levels that were 16.7% higher than those for
female individuals.
Table 2 shows the distribution of serum cystatin C and cre-
atinine for US adolescents aged 12 to 19 yr by gender and
race/ethnicity. The mean cystatin C level was 0.86 mg/L in
non-Hispanic white individuals (95% CI 0.84 to 0.88), 0.80
mg/L in non-Hispanic black individuals (95% CI 0.79 to 0.82),

and 0.80 mg/L in Mexican American individuals (95% CI 0.79
to 0.82). Mean serum cystatin C levels were significantly lower
in non-Hispanic black and Mexican American individuals com-
pared with non-Hispanic white individuals (P  0.003 and P 
0.001, respectively), although the magnitude of the difference
was relatively small. The mean serum creatinine level was 0.71
mg/dl in non-Hispanic white individuals (95% CI 0.69 to 0.73),
0.76 mg/dl in non-Hispanic black individuals (95% CI 0.74 to
0.79), and 0.67 mg/dl in Mexican American individuals (95% CI
0.64 to 0.70). Non-Hispanic black individuals had significantly
higher mean serum creatinine values compared with non-His-
panic white and Mexican American individuals (P  0.004 and
P  0.001, respectively).
Figure 2 shows the mean cystatin C and creatinine levels for
male and female individuals by age. Cystatin C levels decrease
from a peak at age 12 yr in female individuals through age 19
yr, whereas in male individuals, cystatin C levels were highest
at age 14 yr. When examined by Tanner stage, cystatin C levels
were highest in Tanner stage II for female individuals (0.83
mg/L) and highest in Tanner stage IV for male individuals
(0.92 mg/L), consistent with the levels by age. Mean creatinine
levels sharply increased with age for both male and female
individuals between ages 12 and 19 yr.
We conducted univariable and multivariable linear regres-
sion analyses to evaluate factors potentially associated with
serum cystatin C levels (Table 3). Corresponding regression
models are shown for serum creatinine. In unadjusted analysis,
gender, age, race/ethnicity, serum creatinine, uric acid, blood
urea nitrogen (BUN), albumin, hemoglobin, thyroid-stimulat-
ing hormone (TSH), %BF, and FFM all were statistically signif-

icantly associated with cystatin C levels; however, the magni-
tude of the change in cystatin level per unit change in the
covariate, especially with TSH and FFM, was small. CRP and
BMI, reported to be associated with cystatin C levels in adults,
were not statistically significantly associated with cystatin C
levels in adolescents. Not surprising, cystatin C and creatinine
were moderately correlated (r  0.3036), because each repre-
sents a measure of kidney function. Increasing %BF was nega-
tively correlated with both creatinine and cystatin C, as has
been reported in adults.
Female individuals had a mean cystatin C that was 0.092
mg/L lower than that of male individuals (95% CI  0.122 to
0.063), and gender accounted for approximately 14.8% of the
variability in serum cystatin C levels. This is similar to the effect
of gender on creatinine. On average, non-Hispanic black indi-
viduals had serum cystatin C levels 0.054 mg/L lower than
those of non-Hispanic white individuals, and Mexican Ameri-
can individuals had serum cystatin C levels 0.056 mg/L lower
than those of non-Hispanic white individuals. Age was posi-
tively and strongly associated with creatinine, whereas cystatin
C was more weakly and negatively correlated with age. In
unadjusted analysis, each 1-yr increase in age was associated
with a 0.029-mg/dl increase in serum creatinine (95% CI  0.021
to 0.037), and age accounted for approximately 19.7% of the
variation of serum creatinine levels.
In a multivariable model adjusted only for demographic
factors (gender, age, and race/ethnicity; Table 3), female gen-
der, increasing age, and non-Hispanic black and Mexican
American race/ethnicity were still associated with lower cys-
tatin C levels after adjustment. Female gender, lower age, and
non-Hispanic white and Mexican American race/ethnicity
were also associated with lower serum creatinine levels after
adjustment. The fully adjusted model in Table 3 presents the
clinical variables that remain significant sources of variation in
serum levels of cystatin C or creatinine after adjustment for
demographic factors. In this analysis, the effect of gender on
creatinine and cystatin C is comparable, whereas creatinine
increases with age and cystatin C decreases slightly. Non-
Hispanic black individuals have lower cystatin C, whereas they
have higher serum creatinine as compared with non-Hispanic
white individuals. Overall, the clinical variables included in the
multivariable analyses accounted for 30.9% of the variation in
serum cystatin C and 46.2% of the variation in serum creatinine.
After adjustment for demographic factors, CRP, hemoglobin,
serum albumin, TSH, and BMI were no longer statistically
significant sources of variation for cystatin C.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study represents the first evaluation
of the distribution of serum cystatin C and comparison with
serum creatinine in a nationally representative adolescent pop-
ulation, including individuals of different race/ethnicities. The
estimates from this investigation are representative of the civil-
ian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States aged
12 to 19 yr in 1988 through 1994. Previous studies of cystatin
levels in adolescents have been conducted in relatively small,
selected study populations or study populations limited to one
institution or ethnicity (7,8,11­13). Thus, one of the largest
advantages to this study is the generalizability of the results,
presenting the distribution of cystatin C levels in a diverse
population of race and ethnicity from across the United States.
In this broad sample of US adolescents, contrary to reports of
cystatin C levels' being independent of age and gender in
adolescents, female gender, increasing age, and non-Hispanic
black and Mexican American race/ethnicity were significantly
associated with lower cystatin C levels after adjustment.
Earlier reports provided conflicting evidence regarding
whether cystatin C levels vary by gender. Some investigators
found statistically significant differences between genders in
adults (31­34), with men having higher cystatin C levels than
women, whereas others did not (10,13). Even among those who
did find a statistically significant difference between serum
cystatin C concentrations in men and women, some authors
suggested that the difference was small enough to justify a
universal reference range. Only two studies suggested that
gender-specific reference ranges might be appropriate (34,35).
In our study, male adolescents had on average 12.7% higher

mean serum cystatin C level compared with female adoles-
cents, and this difference was constant across race/ethnicity
groups. Creatinine showed a similar gender difference, with
the mean male serum creatinine levels 16.7% higher than those
in female individuals. This result is consistent with other stud-
ies that examined creatinine levels in pediatric populations (36).
Considering that in US adolescents 12 to 19 yr old the effect of
gender on cystatin C levels is nearly equivalent to the effect of
gender on serum creatinine levels, it seems reasonable to con-
clude that gender-specific cystatin C reference intervals may be
appropriate in this population.
It is unclear why female individuals have lower cystatin C
levels than male individuals. Male and female individuals in
this population were similar in age and distribution of race/
ethnicity, and adjustment for these factors did not account for
the gender difference. Young male adults have had GFR re-
ported to be 127 ml/min per 1.73 m2 compared with 118
ml/min per 1.73 m2 in women (37), perhaps explaining the
lower cystatin levels in female individuals. Differences in cys-
tatin C production rather than kidney function may also ac-
count for the lower serum cystatin C levels in girls. Higher
extrarenal elimination, different hormonal variations, or factors
that are present in female individuals and interfere with the
cystatin C assay may also account for the difference by gender.
Serum cystatin C and creatinine levels also differed signifi-

cantly by race/ethnicity. The higher creatinine levels in non-
Hispanic black compared with non-Hispanic white individuals
are well reported and are thought to be explained by racial
differences in muscle mass (38); however, little information
exists regarding cystatin C generation, extrarenal elimination,
or potential assay interference by race/ethnicity. It is possible
that non-Hispanic black and Mexican American individuals
have underlying genetic factors that alter the physiologic pro-
duction and/or elimination of cystatin C. It may also be that
this represents differences in physiologic GFR by race/ethnic-
ity.
In contrast to the positive correlation of age with serum
creatinine corresponding to adolescent maturation and increase
in muscle mass, even within the relatively tight age range of 7
yr in this study population, age was a modest but significant
negative predictor for serum cystatin C levels. This was espe-
cially true in female individuals after the age of 12 and in male
individuals after the age of 14 yr. This contrasts to previous
work that concluded that cystatin C levels were independent of
age in pediatric populations (11,14). Several authors noted an
age-related rise in cystatin C levels after the age of 50 to 60 yr
(15,32,39), which presumably reflects a decline of kidney func-
tion. It is known that there are no changes in GFR during
adolescent maturation (40); thus, in this population of generally
healthy adolescents aged 12 to 19 yr, the age-related variation
in cystatin C levels is likely related to variation in cystatin
production. It is interesting that these age-related changes in
cystatin levels parallel peak height velocity, which also varies
by gender (41) with girls reaching peak height velocity earlier
in development (Tanner stage II) than boys (Tanner stage IV);
this correlates with our analysis that found that the highest
median cystatin C level was in Tanner stage II for female
individuals and Tanner stage IV for male individuals. Perhaps
the variation in cystatin C levels is affected by growth and
metabolic demands in adolescents.
Another notable finding in this study was the independent
association of higher uric acid with higher levels of cystatin C.
Other authors noted an association between hyperuricemia and
renal disease, but most attributed the association to a simple
clustering of hyperuricemia with other well-established cardio-
vascular and renal risk factors (e.g., insulin resistance or type 2
diabetes, high BP, central obesity), and mild hyperuricemia is
generally regarded as insignificant. In this large, generally
healthy population with overall normal uric acid levels and a
low prevalence of renal disease, it is unlikely that renal disease
is responsible for this association. Serum uric acid has been
reported to be correlated with the prevalence of the metabolic
syndrome, particularly abdominal obesity, in NHANES partic-
ipants (42). Although the association of uric acid with serum
cystatin C levels has not been previously described, many other
groups have noted the effect of body composition (including
BMI and %BF) on serum cystatin C levels (16). Although in our
analyses BMI and %BF were not statistically significantly asso-
ciated with serum cystatin C levels after adjustment for demo-
graphic factors, perhaps the association of uric acid with cys-
tatin C is related to other anthropomorphic factors not
measured in the NHANES III survey.
Our study has several limitations, particularly its cross-sec-
tional design and our retrospective use of the data; therefore,
we cannot assess longitudinal changes in cystatin C levels with
age, height velocity, or changes in body habitus. In addition, a
number of measures that are available for adults in NHANES
III are not measured in the adolescent age range, such as
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans to assess body compo-
sition further. Serum samples were available only for individ-
uals who were 12 yr of age; therefore, our results cannot be
generalized to children who are younger than 12. In addition,
formal GFR measurements are not performed in NHANES III;
therefore, we also cannot distinguish intrinsic renal factors
from extrarenal causes of variation in cystatin C levels. Despite
these limitations, this is the largest nationally representative
study of serum cystatin C levels in a pediatric population to
date, demonstrating previously unreported variation in cysta-
tin C levels according to age, race, and gender in the 12- to 19-yr
age group.
Conclusions
Our study provides gender- and race/ethnicity-specific nor-
mal values of cystatin C and creatinine for the general popula-
tion of US adolescents aged 12 to 19 yr. We observed a clear
gender difference in serum cystatin C levels with female indi-
viduals having lower levels than male individuals. We con-
clude that serum cystatin C, in conjunction with serum creati-
nine, is a useful clinical tool for physicians in the routine
assessment of renal function, particularly in the adolescent
population, in which rapidly changing serum creatinine levels
may present a confusing clinical picture. Our study cannot
directly address whether serum cystatin C is a better clinical
marker of kidney function compared with creatinine, because
we have no direct measures of GFR; however, in a comparison
of the effects of age, gender, and race on cystatin C levels with
creatinine, gender and race have comparable magnitude effects
on cystatin C and creatinine, whereas age has a much smaller
effect on cystatin C than on creatinine. Clinicians should bear in
mind that the variation pattern in cystatin C levels is in many
ways opposite to creatinine; namely, that cystatin C levels
decrease slightly with age and are slightly lower in non-His-
panic black compared with non-Hispanic white adolescents.
The tables herein present normal ranges for cystatin C in US
adolescents as measured by the Dade Behring N Latex Cystatin
C assay. Age-, race-, and gender-specific ranges for cystatin C
presented here can be used as another tool for the clinician to
assess kidney function in adolescents.
