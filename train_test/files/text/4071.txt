Abstract
We used Discursive Psychology to study the claims and arguments which occur when `the
child's best interests' is produced as a resource in family mediation settings. Analysis draws on
data from three pairs of separated or separating parents attempting to resolve child contact or
residency disputes through mediation. Our analysis focuses on the tendency of claims to the
abstract notion of the child's best interests to exacerbate conflict, especially as parents drew
on conflicting research in this area. Changing expectations of fathering could be observed in
the men's argumentative positioning, and this was taken up in different ways by ex-partners and
by mediators. Participants aligned themselves with mediators' statements by picking up details
of mediators' language, hampering mediators' attempted neutrality. The problematic nature of
acknowledging the intensity of emotions in this process was also highlighted.

Introduction
We take a Discursive Psychology approach to consider how children's well-being and
interests concerning post-separation parenting are presented and responded to in family
mediation sessions. In particular, we investigate how the concept of `the child's best inter-
ests' is produced as a resource in mediation settings (by parents and mediators). At which
points in the discussion is this invoked, and with what effect? We analyse extracts from
family mediation sessions, selected from three pairs of separated or separating parents
attempting to resolve child contact or residency disputes through mediation. How are
children's needs and interests occasioned in mediation talk? When and how do parents
refer to their child's interests, and/or to the more abstract concept of `a child's best inter-
ests', and how is this responded to? We are interested in how the concept of the child's
best interests becomes a resource for parental positions and arguments about contact, resi-
dency and parenting agreements after separation. Does the appeal to considering a child's
best interests progress the mediation talk in a way which enables conflict resolution? Is
the concept of a child's best interests a useful one for mediators to focus on?
One of the key stated aims of mediation, and of the law concerning post-separation
arrangements for children (Children Act 1989 s 1) is a focus on a child's welfare or best
interests. Studies of therapeutic processes have found that children's interests are rou-
tinely sidelined or represented (Hutchby and O'Reilly, 2010), and this has been found
in mediation too. Dingwall and Greatbatch (1991), reporting on a study of UK media-
tion in the 1980s, argued that dispute resolution was a parent-centred process with par-
ents and conciliators making few references to child welfare. However, a generation on,
the findings from the 1980s study may not reflect current mediation practices, views of
child well-being or parenting norms. Trinder et al. (2010) looked at in-court concilia-
tion, using conversation analysis (CA) to study how the child's needs and wishes were
discussed by parents and conciliators (sessions recorded in 2004­2005), concluding
that `the needs and wishes of these children are regularly invoked by adults, but as a
strategic and contingent argumentative resource, rather than as the starting point for the
decision-making process' (p. 234). A consistent feature in their data was that parents
focused in talk on their needs and wishes as parents ­ in contrast to the `official' idea of
the child's needs being focused on. Conciliators also attended to this and focused on the
parents' feelings about not seeing their child. Trinder et al. conclude `The challenge for
the next decade is to find child-centred methods of routinely including children in dis-
pute resolution processes'. A decade on from this research, despite consistent attention
on the importance of prioritising children's needs in dispute resolution processes, chil-
dren are rarely directly included (Barlow et al., 2014; Walker and Lake-Carroll, 2014),
which leads to the child's voice or interest usually being represented by its parents, or
brought up by the practitioner, in dispute resolution processes. It is therefore relevant to
consider how children's views, needs, or interests are discussed in their absence in the
mediation setting.
Smithson et al. 611
The data come from a three-year, Economic and Social Research Council-(ESRC)
funded study `Mapping Paths to Family Justice'undertaken by the Universities of Exeter
and Kent. The project's central aim was to provide evidence about the awareness, usage,
experience and outcomes of out-of-court Family Dispute Resolution (FDR) processes.
We used several research methods to address these aims. First, we conducted a national
survey of out-of-court FDR awareness and experiences, and second, an individual inter-
view study with 95 people who had experienced an out-of-court FDR process between
1996 and 2013 as well as 40 individual interviews with FDR practitioners. For the final
phase of the study, we recorded examples of each FDR process. We recorded five com-
plete mediation processes (four concerning children's matters and one financial; nine
sessions in total), as well as three collaborative law processes (11 sessions in total) and
five first interviews within solicitor negotiation processes. The overall project findings
have been reported elsewhere (Barlow et al., 2013, 2014; Hunter et al., 2014). Here, we
focus on the data from some of the recorded mediation sessions. Notably, despite our
efforts to include experiences of child-inclusive mediation (both in interviews with prac-
titioners and parties, and our recorded sessions), there were few actual instances of this
­ only two interviewed parties had experienced this. Although two-thirds of the media-
tors interviewed had trained in child-inclusive mediation, they either rarely practised it
or had qualms about doing so (Ewing et al., 2015). For example, one mediator (and
solicitor) said that `I have never found the need to bring children into mediation because
my practice seems to work quite well on the basis that the children's voice is heard but
it's the parents that will bring that voice'. Another mediator and solicitor said,
I guess I would be hoping that the parents could be reliable consultants with their own children
and what their wishes are, because if they aren't reliable then the thing is fairly doomed from
the start and there is a lot of work to be done.
So, the child's voice­or wishes­is assumed or hoped to be represented by the parents
in the mediation process. In this article, we draw on data from the mediation processes
involving children's matters ­ and in particular on data from three sets of parents ­ to
investigate when and how talk about children's best interests is occasioned during medi-
ation sessions, and what effect this has on the process.
Analytic approach
We used a Discursive Psychology approach, drawing on elements of critical discourse
analysis and CA to understand how participants display understandings in everyday, or
`naturally-occurring', talk (Edwards and Potter, 2001; McHoul and Rapley, 2005).
Discursive approaches have no recognisable `method'in terms of formalised procedures,
but share a set of assumptions about language practices ­ an `analytic mentality'
(Schenkein, 1978). A Discursive Psychology approach typically `starts with the catego-
ries, constructions and orientations through which a sense of agency, say, or severe dis-
tress, or a moment of understanding are displayed in a piece of interaction in a particular
setting' (Wiggins and Potter, 2007: 73). Language is both constructed and constructive;
it is action oriented and situated within a particular sequential environment ­ words are
612 Discourse Studies 17(5)
understood according to what precedes and follows them. The analytic focus is on exam-
ining discursive practices in naturalistic materials, including institutional talk. We view
mediation as an institutional practice in that talk in mediation settings is normally goal
oriented with particular forms of talk permitted; moreover, participants attend to their
institution-relevant identities ­ for example, mediator, parent, ex-partner (Drew and
Heritage, 1992). In discursive approaches, a few cases, analysed in detail, are assumed to
shed light on widespread practices and assumptions, and also possibly highlight future
areas to be investigated on a larger scale (McHoul and Rapley, 2005). Discursive
Psychology's emphasis on the construction of specific versions encourages the researcher
to consider the practices that those versions are part of, and the particular work that they
perform (Edwards and Potter, 2001). For this analysis, we consider how parents talk in
mediation sessions about parenting, child residency, gender equality, without taking
these claims as facts about the family or individuals'experience. How do people draw on
resources, such as claims about parenting behaviour, or a child's best interests. How are
claims built up? (Heritage, 2012). At what point in a discussion do participants draw on
a resource, and what effect does this have on the progression of the talk? How does the
mediation process ­ or the institution ­ produce certain forms of arguments and make
other types of talk less likely?
Mediation processes have been the subject of a number of discursively oriented
studies, and in particular from CA, which have focused on how mediators develop
`de-escalatory practices' (Greatbatch and Dingwall, 1997), how mediators attempt to
maintain a stance of neutrality (Jacobs, 2002) and how neighbourhood mediators
work to obtain a `solution' (Stokoe, 2015). These studies noted gaps between norma-
tive ideals and actual practice, as mediators face multiple competing demands which
lead to `interactional difficulties'. So, while neutrality may be aimed for, CA analy-
ses have demonstrated how the mediator manages this ideal in interaction, while
simultaneously progressing the task of achieving outcomes and deflecting tension.
Garcia (2010) demonstrated how participants actively align themselves with their
mediator in neighbourhood disputes, using `interactional competence', so while offi-
cially it is the mediator's job to balance power between disputants, in practice par-
ticipants shift the power. A discursive analysis avoids making inferences about
participants' inner beliefs, or moral judgements on participants' truthfulness, but
views talk as a participatory activity. Parents' assertions that they want to do their
best by their children are treated as statements produced to demonstrate competence
(Dingwall and Greatbatch, 1993).
Analysis
Extracts were selected from the nine recorded mediation sessions on two related criteria.
We looked for instances of parents talking about the `best interests' of the child, and also
for talk that included related concepts, in particular abstract ideas about child well-being,
what is good for children in general. We use extracts from mediation sessions with three
heterosexual couples. In this data, talk about a child's best interests cropped up when
parents were in dispute about where children should live after parental separation, and
how much contact each parent would have:
Smithson et al. 613
Extract 1. Separated couple, Jack and Kerry,1 with a woman mediator
An hour into their first mediation session, the father (Jack) has been describing his idea of how
their child will be cared for during time spent at his house.
 1. Med So it looks as though [you
 2. Kerry [So it looks as though I have got to sit down yeah, I
 3. have got to mediate, I have got to roll over, I have got to make the effort
 4. and do things for both of us but what I get nothing out of it and I am still
 5. left like yeah.
 6. Med You are not rolling over and it's not about what you get out of it it's about
 7. Josh and it's about Josh having [a healthy relationship with both of you.
 8. Kerry [Yeah but alright [yeah so ok ok ok I don't
 9. mean what I get out of it ok but so everything I want (.) right (.) (sniffs)
10. everything I want for my son I can't have. (0.2) [what he can't have
11. Jack [It's not what you want for
12. your son it's what you want for your[self.
13. Kerry [What I want for my son I am saying I
14. HAVE GOT MY SON'S INTERESTS AT HEART Jack.
15. Jack No you haven't.
16. Kerry Oh ok alright I wouldn't be HERE now if I was thinking about myself
17. would I?
18. Jack You would
19. Kerry I wouldn't be here now. I'm gonna walk out in a minute.
Here, the mother, Kerry, produces a strong statement, `I have got to ... ' repeated four
times. `but what I get nothing out of it'. The mediator responds with a direct rebuttal of
Kerry's claim. `You are not rolling over' and follows this up with a rebuke `it's not about
what you get out of it it's about Josh'. In the context of mediation, this exchange has two
noteworthy aspects. The direct rebuttal of a participant's claim and moral rebuke are in
contravention of the assumption of neutrality ­ the mediator backs up her strong rebuke
with a claim about what mediation is and is not about: `it's about Josh ... '. The institu-
tional business of mediation is shown by the mediator to be about the child, and about the
child having `a healthy relationship' with both parents. In this way, the centrality of the
child's interests is attended to by the mediator, but in doing so she had to override core
mediation values of neutrality and objectivity (Greatbatch and Dingwall, 1997, 1999).
Kerry suggests that this means that `everything I want for my son I can't have', and
quickly reframes this as `he can't have'. At this point Jack, the father, picks up on this
and mirrors the mediator in rebuking Kerry for her focus on herself. Kerry's response to
this explicitly links what she wants for her son with having `my son's interests at heart'
(capitals denote shouting). In fact, she claims, her wishes for her son are based on his
interests. She offers evidence ­ her participation in the mediation process.
In this extract, the mediator introduces the focus on the child at a point of tension in
the discussion, and the parents take this up as a resource, with Jack suggesting that Kerry
is prioritising her own wishes, which rouses Kerry to a defence for which she uses the
term `my son's interest'. We see how here the mediator's attempt to focus the discussion
on the child's interest is not a successful tool for calming the discussion, but rather the
614 Discourse Studies 17(5)
opposite­it becomes a challenge to the mother, and the father takes up the term enthusi-
astically as a strategic way of demonstrating his ex-partner's (inappropriate) focus on
herself:
Extract 2: Separated couple Nicola and Jordan with a woman mediator
 1. Med OK. So what (.). What um obviously I'm gonna come back to you in a
 2. moment Nicola, but what would (.) you think work better for (.)
 3. Jordan Well I would like to start with um sha:red residency (.) and then
 4. take it from there.
5. (0.2)
 6. Nicola And you feel that that's in Harry's best interest?
 7. Jordan Yeah I do. There's been, there's been, um, countless surveys and stuff
 8. done. On families (.) what would you suggest then?
 9. Med Just a moment there. Jordan what do you mean by shared residency?
10. Jordan One week, one weekend (.) with both families.
11. Nicola Have you thought about the logistics of that?
12. Jordan Yeah, That's why, that's why
13. [that's why (.) we haven't moved (.) from [town], you've moved and
14. Nicola [Have you thought about how you're gonna do school pickups?
15. Jordan moved and gone down and come back and registered him in other
16. schools we're in [town] we can be a constant in his life. (.). And as such,
17. shared residency is a good starting point. Now, if you don't want to
18. agree with that suggest something else.
19. Med Just a moment, what do you mean by sh.. so one week aa, one week
20. from s, Friday to Friday
21. Jordan Yeah (0.2). And then (.) alternate Christmases, Christmas Eve,
22. Christmas Day, um (.) ten days holiday, at the minute Nicola feels
23. that ten days is too long for Harry to be away on holiday with us. (.)
24. um he's been away with Nicola on holiday for ten days this year
25. which (.) you know, I (.) agreed to. Because it's important to him
26. to spend as much time (.) with both families. Because it is within his
27. best interest, you know.
28. Med So Nicola you have listened to that and I know you have got
29. concerns so let's let's uh let's hear what your thoughts are.
30. Nicola Ok well I categorically disagree with the um (.) shared residency.
31. Jordan Ok what, well then you suggest what you think would be [um
32. Nicola
[I've told you
33. what my suggestion is Jordan, it's [ um
34. Jordan
[what's your suggestion?
35. Med [Can I, I'll do it, can I hear it?
36. (laughter)
37. Med OK.
In this extract, the mediator asks Jordan, what he thinks would `work better for' the
child, Harry. Jordan's response (Lines 3­4) is quite specific, a direct drawing on a pre-
sumption of shared residency (Fehlberg et al., 2011; Trinder, 2010). To this, Nicola asks
whether this will be in `Harry's best interest'. The presumption of shared residency is
Smithson et al. 615
countered with the concept of the child's best interest. This is not a `rights-based' dis-
course from Jordan, it is an `evidence-based' discourse referring to child well-being
research. The mediator questions this reading of shared residency (Line 9). Nicola coun-
ters with reference to `the logistics' (Line 11) ­ not with reference to 50:50 parenting. In
response, Jordan brings in an example of `parental one-upmanship' ­ unlike Nicola, he
implies, he has not moved around, he is therefore demonstrably a `constant' in their
child's life. We see in this extract several categories which participants link to the child's
interest ­ doing school pickups (Line 14), being a `constant' (Line 16).
The mediator intervenes with a focus on the practicalities (Line 19). While this might
seem to be a neutral intervention, it links back to Nicola's challenge to think about the
`logistics'. In this way, an ostensibly neutral intervention often patterns or references one
party's claim or terms. Jordan brings in a complaint about Nicola (Lines 22­27), finish-
ing with another appeal to the child's best interest: Jordan thus positions himself as rea-
sonable, in contrast to Nicola's unreliability in moving around, but also demonstrates his
attention to the child's best interest. On being invited by the mediator to respond, Nicola
`categorically' disagrees with the shared residency. This extreme case formulation
(Pomerantz, 1986) needs no elaboration or justification (Sidnell, 2004). The form of the
statement closes down discussion. Antaki and Wetherell (1999) demonstrated how
extreme case formulation can be used to subsequently `show' concession, and Nicola's
categorical refusal here may be a strategic move.
During this extract, first Nicola and then Jordan challenges the other, citing the child's
interest (rather than their rights or preferences as parents) as a reason for their position.
Jordan draws explicitly on the `evidence base' for shared parenting; Nicola talks about
`logistics', the example of which is `school pick-ups'. The concept of the child's best
interest in this talk is invoked by Nicola as a response to a plea for shared residency, and
by Jordan as a summary of his argument for the child spending equal (or as much as
possible) time with both families.
In the third extract, a separating couple discuss a similar issue. Peter has proposed that
both of their children have two separate but equal homes, spending one week in each.
Roberta is unenthusiastic:
Extract 3: Peter and Roberta with male mediator (Session 1)
 1. Med Um (.) How much of all thi:is (.) is about (.) how each of you might feel (.)
 2. with with the children (.) not having, not being (.) with the children not
 3. being with you as much as you both want? So so for example, for you,
 Roberta, um how would it feel for the (.) not to see them for (.) uh, a week,
 4. and (.) how much is that dri:iving your decision making?
 5. Roberta Um that um that's not driving it at a:all. Umm uumm (0.2)
 6. Med Okay. And the same question, by the way, Peter.
 7. Roberta It is purely about what I believe to be the best for them. They (.)
 8. um and (.) you know there may be some element of (.) umm, are they at
 9. are they with Peter, crying, and they want me. Um (.) and I will find that
10. very difficult to deal with. Not I mean, not (.) obviously, I'll miss them if I
11. don't have them for a week but i:it's (.) it's more to do with how I (0.1)
12. would worry how they're feeling about things (.) and not being there for them
616 Discourse Studies 17(5)
13. Med Soo the same question for you, Peter. Actually, before I come back to
14. because I'm hearing a lot of `I believe, I believe' and that's that's but how
15. how (.) how much of it is it about you? (.) I mean, be perfectly honest
16. about this, I'll ask that same question really. About how you might fe:el if
17. (.) you see them (.) Fri Friday, Saturday and Sunday, alternate weeks with
18. uh (.) with uh one night a week (.) every week (.) for you?
19. Peter Uum [coughs] I think (.) [coughs] excuse me. (.) Uum (.) I think I
20. would just feel (.) cut off and distanced a:and (.) um (.) you know,
21. there's an element of (.) relegation uuh (.) to:o (.) not being able to
22. fulfil (.) the role that I have been fulfilling since they were born (.) Um
23. (.) um (.) and I don't see why (.) that should happen (.) to the
24. detriment of the children. Because I (.) you know I um.. my belief um I
25. believe that Roberta and I offer(.) different valuable things (.) to to each of
26. our children and I don't see why (.) um they shouldn't benefit from that.
The mediator indirectly suggests here (Lines 1­4) that the parents in dispute about
child contact and residency might not be focusing on the children's best interests, but
perhaps (and reasonably, he implies) `how would it feel . . . not to see them for . . . a
week?'. Roberta denies this bluntly `it's not that at all', and elaborates bringing in directly
the concept of the children's best interests ­ `It is purely about what I believe to be the best
for them'. This is another extreme case formulation ­ both hard to counteract, and also
setting up possibilities for `show' concessions later. Roberta insists that her opposition to
the 50:50
week-with-each-parent proposal is based on the children's emotional needs.
However, the justification for this claim is interesting as it hinges on her feelings and
involvement: `I would worry how they're feeling'and `not being there for them'. Roberta's
argument thus links the children's interests and needs with her presence. She is the parent
most attentive to the children's emotional needs, and therefore, her feelings and emotions
about the children are not separable from their best interests. This is a strong assertion
about who has the right to make epistemic claims about the children's interests.
Here (Lines 13-18) the mediator, performing a symmetrical neutrality, repeats his
earlier question to Peter, of his feelings about Roberta's earlier proposal that the children
live with their father for alternate weekends, plus a midweek night (a common contact
arrangement in the United Kingdom). Peter responds (Lines 19­20) `I would just feel cut
off and distanced' and refers to `the role that I have been fulfilling since they were born'
(Line 22). In this term, he manages to demonstrate his emotional involvement, but also
his active longstanding involvement, concluding with a reference to the children's best
interests: `I don't see why that should happen to the detriment of the children.' He adds
to this (Lines 25­26) that both parents offer `different valuable things'which the children
should benefit from.
Both parents resist the suggestion that their feelings are driving their preferences, and
talk instead about the impact on the children. Peter additionally emphasises his long-term
childcaring involvement, and draws on abstract notions of good parenting. The mediator
attempts to talk about the parents' feelings, perhaps to challenge the either/or dichotomy
of feelings versus evidence in parenting. The dispute between these parents over how
much time the children will spend in each parent's home continues into the second
mediation session (a few weeks later):
Smithson et al. 617
Extract 4: Peter and Roberta (Session 2)
 1. Roberta I mean, really the children need consistency (.) and they need a base. They
 2. need to know where their house is. They need to know that this is when
 3. they are going to be at home. How would you like to li:ive in a hotel for six
 4. nights and then in another hotel for another six nights and just keep (.)
5. shifting? It makes no sense. That's not normal. This is what I am ta:alking
 6. about, being rational to the point of lu lunacy. That is not (.) normal (.) for
 7. children. They need to have a home and then they will go and see you (.)
 8. for five nights out of fourteen.
 (a few lines omitted)
 9. Peter Okay. So (0.2) what you are saying about they need a home, (.) a base and
10. then some other uh prop:erty too, this is wrong. The way you are speaking
11. about it is wrong. We are two parents. We conceived them. We've brought
12. them up for six years. They will have two houses of equal standing (.) with
13. two parents of equal STANDING.
14. Med Is the reality however, whatever language you both [uh whatever
15. Peter
[WAKE UP!
16. Med language you both use (.) is they will have (.) a home with you both and it's
17. a question of how much time they spend in each home (.) with you both
18. [and with
19. Peter [Yes. A home with us both. I have had enough of your arrogance.
Roberta talks (Lines 1­6) about what the children need: consistency, a base, to know
where their house is. She is drawing on abstract notions, but then moves rhetorically
into more personal territory `How would you like to live in a hotel ...?'. She contrasts
the `normal' experience she is proposing with the `lunacy' of Peter's `rational' 50:50
suggestion. She finishes her turn with an absolute `They need to have a home and then
they will go and see you (.) for five nights out of fourteen'. Here Roberta is in line with
the current default practice in family law, whereby children usually live primarily
with the mother. Roberta does not justify why she (rather than Peter) will be the parent with
9/14 nights; her argument rests on the children's need for `a home' (Line 7) rather than
two `hotels', `and then they will go and see you (.) for five nights out of fourteen'. This
is similar to Nicola's `categorical refusal' to contemplate 50:50 residency in Extract 2.
Neither statement is taken by the speaker to require justification, which closes down
discussion. Peter takes issue with the idea of `a home, (.) a base, and then some other uh
prop:erty'. He refers to equality of parenting (Lines 9-12). He then maintains that `They
will have two houses of equal standing (.) with two parents of equal STANDING'(Lines
12­13). The mediator intervenes and­while his turn has aspects of an impartial formu-
lation: `Is the reality however ...'­this is a mild rebuttal of Peter's statement by suggest-
ing that the exact language (home, house, property) is unimportant. However, he
continues that `they will have (.) a home with you both' ­ which is in line with Peter's
terminology, and not Roberta's. Peter picks up on this and immediately agrees `Yes.
A home with us both' (Line 19). Here, the mediator uses standard current practice in
how to talk about post-separation parenting (two homes, even if children spend more
time in one). Despite the mediator's attempts to remain neutral, his lexical choices
privilege one party's words or claims over the other.
618 Discourse Studies 17(5)
For the next extract, we return to Nicola and Jordan, in the same mediation session as
earlier, still discussing shared residency:
Extract 5: Nicola and Jordan
 1. Med But um can we just while we are on the issue I wasn't going to spend
 2. as much time on Christmas (.) but uh it seems to me that there is a
 3. major misunderstanding between you uh to put it mildly uh at the
 4. moment as to what's actually going to happen this Christmas [so let's

5. Nicola
[Yeah
 6. well (.) that that's the reason that I wanted to cover it today because no
 7. conversation has been entered into regarding Christmas this year (0.2)
8. Med [Mm
 9. Nicola [and my situation is very different because I am not at work.
10. Jordan But this isn't about you, it is about Harry [and what's best for him.
11. Nicola [what well I care for Harry
12. and soo (.) because if (.) i it is about my circumstances.
13. Med Mm
14. Nicola I am on maternity leave this year and therefore (0.2) I am prepared
15. for Harry to have Christmas with you guys.
The mediator (Lines 1­4) attempts to progress the talk on from the cyclical disa-
greement, downgrading the couple's argument to a `major misunderstanding', though
the following `to put it mildly' suggests the mediator is aware of this being a reformu-
lation. The reformulation of disagreement to `misunderstanding' is routine in counsel-
ling talk. Edwards and Potter (2001) argue that such reformulations perform two
functions. They downplay tension, suggesting no fault, while setting up relationship
problems as a kind of puzzle that can be unravelled via counselling. Moreover, they
might demonstrate to fighting ex-couples how to constructively talk about their dif-
ferences in future.
The mediator stresses that the topic of Christmas is a participant-led concern ­
which Nicola immediately ratifies `because no conversation has been entered into
regarding Christmas this year'. The use of formal, third-person language is a way of
demonstrating reasonableness and capacity to step back from emotions (Edwards and
Potter, 2001), particularly in interactions involving both professional and lay members
(Atkinson, 1982). Nicola suggests that her working situation is relevant, but Jordan's
response draws again on the concept of the child's interests: `But this isn't about you,
it is about Harry and what's best for him'. Nicola subsequently moves to a personal
claim `well I care for Harry'. This reference to maternal care is drawn on as relevant to
considering the child's interests ­ as Roberta did in Extract 3. Nicola suggests a solu-
tion (Lines 14­15), but this is presented not as Jordan's right (or as Harry's best inter-
est), but rather as a gracious relinquishment: `therefore I am prepared'. The earlier
extreme case formulation is here modified with a `show' concession (Antaki and
Wetherell, 1999). Jordan returns to the notion of shared residency, and the final extract
is five minutes later in this session:
Smithson et al. 619
Extract 6: Nicola and Jordan
1. Jordan and to increase the contact is only a good thing and not a bad thing. (0.2)
2. Med Ok Nicola, do you want to respond (.) to any of that?
3. Nicola Yeah I I disagree with that. I feel that (.) Harry needs a base (.) I feel
4. that he needs (.) [a
5. Jordan [But he has a base
6. Nicola Sorry, I am responding. (.) He needs a base, he needs (.) stability, he
7. needs a routine, he (.) he shouldn't be:e pushed from pillar to post (.)
8. umm and he:e umm (0.2) and on that basis I categorically disagree with
9. shared residency.
Jordan has just produced an elaborate description of what he and his partner and their
child can offer Harry, culminating with a claim based on an abstract norm: to increase the
contact [with father, stepmother and half sibling] is `only a good thing and not a bad thing'
­ another extreme case formulation. Nicola's response is similar to Roberta's in Extract 3,
with a three-part list pattern: the child needs a base, stability, routine. Nicola repeats her
earlier `categorical disagreement' with shared residency, claiming that a child needs one
stable base. Previously, Nicola drew on her knowledge of Harry's need for care (Extract 2).
Here, she draws on general ideas of what is good for a child (a base, stability, a routine),
though she talks specifically about Harry (not an abstract child) needing this.
Discussion
We have highlighted how parents drew on various argumentative resources to demon-
strate their attention to good parenting, while negotiating shared care of their children.
Investigating the details of the talk helps clarify how the mediation process, both in the
goals and assumptions inherent in the institution, and in mediators' practices, produces
certain forms of claims and arguments.
Our analysis adds to previous research with close attention to the resources that par-
ents currently bring into the mediation sessions. In these extracts, we observe the gen-
dered cultural norms of mothering and fathering being both displayed and contested. The
role of fathers post-separation is more contested than in previous decades. While this
fine-grained analysis focuses on just three couples over nine mediation sessions, the
findings are consistent with a much larger set of observations compiled by a range of
investigators (summarised by Dingwall, 2010). Moreover, the concerns and arguments
demonstrated in these sessions mirror recent family law debates and shifts in expecta-
tions of post-separation parenting (Collier and Sheldon, 2008).
Parents come to mediation services with strategies and knowledge ­ but sometimes
from contradictory sources, such as competing `expert' positions on a child's well-
being. They engage performatively in the mediation process, demonstrating parental
competence, reasonableness and attention to the child's best interest. They also align
themselves with mediators whose interventions may be intended neutrally but can be
taken up by parents as argumentative resources (previously noted in Garcia's (2010)
neighbourhood mediation participants). Both fathers and mothers refer to the `child's
620 Discourse Studies 17(5)
best interests', directly and implicitly, as justification for their proposals about shared
parenting arrangements. Two mothers in these extracts make links between their emo-
tional state and the child's best interests, which is taken by the fathers (and sometimes
the mediators) as the mothers attending to their own needs in contrast to focusing on the
child's best interests. However, this contrast depends on an assumption of autonomy, in
which the interests of all ­ in this case, parents and child ­ are independent. An alterna-
tive reading is possible and has been taken up by feminist scholars (e.g. Diduck, 2013)
who argue that an inability to disentangle each individual's interests may only be a
`problem' because the current autonomy discourse has made it so.
In these extracts, the fathers do not invoke a parental rights discourse (though they do
elsewhere), but refer to research which supports shared parenting, to the concept of the
child's best interests and to their personal history of involved parenting. These are sys-
tematic (and predictable) differences in the resources from parenting literature which
fathers and mothers use as justification, but here, we note how fathers and mothers in
these studies both orient to the `child's interests', rather than to their rights as parents, or
their feelings. It seems that an acknowledgement of one's parental feelings is risky as it
may lead to accusations of being selfish or irrational. This might be alleviated by more
explicit focus during the process on the emotional impact of these topics, and develop-
ment by mediation services of therapeutic skills for dealing with emotions (Lewis, 2008).
We can see a gender difference in the activities which fathers and mothers are per-
forming. With all three couples, the mother is either currently, or assumes she is likely to
become, the primary carer, with the child/children spending the majority of their time
living in her house. The fathers are all arguing for a greater share of parenting ­ Jack, for
two consecutive days, the other two for equally shared parenting. Nicola feels it is pos-
sible to `categorically refuse' to contemplate 50:50 parenting arrangements (Extracts 2
and 5), and Roberta makes a similar categorical statement (Extract 4). We do not know
the details of previous parenting in these couples, but in terms of the interactional posi-
tions in mediation, men are regularly in a position of challenging existing or assumed
childcare arrangements while women are more often defending the status quo (also noted
by Dingwall et al., 1998). Notably, fathers in these extracts feel justified in arguing for
equal parenting time. These observable gender differences in mediation talk can be
understood discursively in terms of the parenting position and legal options available,
rather than necessarily an innate gender difference (Stokoe and Smithson, 2001).
Our interest in mediators' talk here is primarily on how their interventions attend to,
privilege or avoid certain types of claim or evidence. We see how mediators' interven-
tions might inadvertently privilege one party's argument, by lexical choice or mirroring
talk. Greatbatch and Dingwall (1989) similarly highlighted how mediators may offer
`selective facilitation', encouraging parents towards a particular option rather than
remaining resolutely neutral. Much time is taken up with arguing over lexical choices;
choice of phrase can be crucial to the mediation process (Stokoe, 2013). Specifically, the
fathers were insistent that their home should be known as one of the child's homes, and
this might be as important as how many nights the child spends there. These arguments,
both sides with evidence bases in parenting literature, reflect the related clash of para-
digms in the legal system, and recent debates on the presumption of shared care versus
the `one home with primary carer' model. While parents in these mediation sessions ori-
ent in their talk to child's interests rather than parents'rights (more so than in the in-court
Smithson et al. 621
conciliation talk studied by Trinder et al., 2010), this alone will not provide solutions to
the details of shared care. An appeal to parents to consider the child's interests may refo-
cus them on the child, but notions of the child's best interests can be drawn on in conflict-
ing, but evidence-based ways. In this data, a reference to the child's best interests often
exacerbated conflict.
We would make several recommendations as to how mediators might address the
issues identified in this article. Briefly, these include the following (considered in more
detail in Barlow et al., 2014; Ewing et al., 2015):
· child-inclusive mediation (where children are old enough to be meaningfully
included);
· better initial screening to identify when parents hold strongly polarised norms;
· joined-up support for mediation clients, particularly including counselling/thera-
peutic interventions;
· steering parents away from oppositional use of abstract statements and research
evidence and encouraging them to focus on the actual needs and interests of their
particular children;
· robust reality testing of parents' proposals, to determine how they will work in
practice in the context of the particular family.
