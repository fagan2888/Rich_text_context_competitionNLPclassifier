Introduction
In the era of globalization with rapidly changing economic,
sociocultural, political, and environmental conditions, urban
and regional planners need to become more resilient, innova-
tive, and be able to better deal with the complex and compli-
cated nature of cities and their regions. Urban and regional
planning ("planning" in short) education plays a fundamen-
tal role in training and forming planning practitioners to be
able to tackle such problem. In the globalizing and rapidly
changing world, transcultural engagement has demonstrated
its potentialities for planning education and practice to
become more attentive to the diversity and change manage-
ment (Abramson, 2005). Along with this, the need to interna-
tionalize planning education has been widely recognized by
various associations such as the North American Association
of Collegiate Schools of Planning, Association of European
SchoolsofPlanning,AustralianandNewZealandAssociation
of Planning Schools, and Planning Institute of Australia
(Frank, 2006).
Reid and Loxton (2004) stressed that from the student per-
spective, internationalization can mean the experience of vis-
iting a different country, learning about contrasting ways of
living and thinking, and perhaps integrating these experiences
into their own value systems. This seems to reflect closely on
the wider strategies of many universities, which seek to pre-
pare students to live and work in a global and multicultural
society, with cultural and environmental sensitivity, under-
standing, and communicative competencies (Reid & Loxton,
2004). An international field trip can be defined as an educa-
tional trip to an international destination for observing and/or
taking (non)experimental research relevant to the study/proj-
ect of involved students. In this perspective, these trips repre-
sent a widely regarded and useful delivery mechanism for
such enriching educational experience and competencies,
where students can learn via firsthand experiences (Fuller,
Edmonson, France, Higgitt, & Ratinen, 2006; Houser,
Brannstrom, Quiring, & Lemmons, 2011). This makes the
international field trip approach one of the "optimal" models
for positive learning outcomes as long as it is linked with the
project started in the classroom and continued after the return
from the trip (Edwards, 2009).
This article aims to explore the role of international field
trips in cultivating the pedagogy of student experience in
the planning practice in the light of the literature and orga-
nized field trip exercises. The article reflects on the experi-
ences from the four consecutive international field trips
organized to Malaysia (2008), Korea (2009), Turkey
(2010), and Taiwan (2011) based on the analyses results of
(a) student focus group interviews, (b) field trip evaluation

Cultivating the Pedagogy of Experience
Through International Field Trips:
Beyond the National Context
Tan Yigitcanlar1
Abstract
Urban and regional planners, in the era of globalization, require being equipped with necessary skill sets to better deal with
complex and rapidly changing economic, sociocultural, political, and environmental fabrics of cities and their regions. To
provide such skill sets, urban and regional planning curriculum of Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia,
offers planning practice in the international context. This article, first, reports the findings of pedagogic analyses of the
international field trips conducted to Malaysia, Korea, Turkey, and Taiwan. The article, then, discusses the opportunities and
constraints of exposure of students to planning practice beyond the Australian context.

surveys, (c) informal discussions with professors, and (d)
student performance differences between student groups
who participated and had not participated in international
field trips. These field trips took place as part of the regional
planning practice course of Queensland University of
Technology (QUT), Brisbane, Australia, where some of the
4th-year undergraduate planning students attended.
The article is structured in five parts. Following this intro-
duction, the section "Internationalization of Education,
International Field Trips, and Student Performance" presents
the summary of the review of the literature on international-
ization of higher education, international field trips, and stu-
dent performance, and highlights the benefits of expanding
the planning curriculum to incorporate international ele-
ments such as field trips. "Evaluating the Learning Outcomes
of International Field Trips" section reports the purpose and
technical details of the course and four international field
trips organized jointly by QUT and hosting universities of
the visited countries between 2008 and 2011. The section
"Method, Analysis, and Results" discusses the field trip out-
comes in the light of information collected through student
interviews, surveys, and assignment performances along
with discussions with their professors. The last section con-
cludes by highlighting the opportunities and constraints of
exposure of students to regional planning practice beyond
the national (Australian) context.
Internationalization of Education,
International Field Trips,
and Student Performance
Globalization and the ascendancy of the knowledge- and
service-based marketplace have had a profound impact on the
economic, sociocultural, political, and environmental con-
texts, and consequently resulted in a trend toward growing
reflexivity within the higher education system (Yigitcanlar,
2011). According to Khan (2009),
globalization requires interaction with different regions and
various cultures and this is leading universities to redefine the
direction of their courses and the graduate attributes to be
pursued. Economic and cultural pressures associated with
globalization have created a concern for a workforce that is
globally aware and employable in cross-cultural settings . . . In
order to remain competitive, universities feel the need to
internationalize their course content. (p. 1)
According to Coates and Edwards (2009), graduates need
to be conscious of increasing diversity in their social and
organizational surroundings. They also need to obtain the
skills and knowledge that will allow them to be better pre-
pared for local and global citizenship. J. Knight and de Wit
(1997) defined internationalization of higher education as a
"proactive" response to globalization. Writing from a North
American perspective,Ali and Doan (2006) referred to recent
efforts to internationalize planning education to provide stu-
dents with a fundamental multicultural understanding. They
indicated that this emerging trend has led many universities
to develop internationalization strategies, as part of an effort
to recruit a greater proportion of international students and
staff. However, these approaches to internationalizing higher
education have been criticized by some who argue that such
a shift involves more than just marketing the university to
attract foreign students and staff (Wende, 2001). According
to J. Knight (2003), internationalizing the university system
requires "integrating an international, intercultural or global
dimension into the purpose, functions or delivery of post-
secondary education" (p. 2), and therefore, recommends
increasing foreign research collaborations, establishing
international didactic partnerships, and expanding the cur-
riculum to incorporate international elements. While support
for the internationalization of the university curriculum has
increased significantly in recent years, the internationaliza-
tion of higher education is arguably still in its infancy (Back,
Davis, & Olsen, 1996). This, hence, invites a greater collab-
orative effort from academic communities.
Internationalization, originating from within the planning
academy itself, is an expanding movement toward further
developing international research partnerships, enhancing the
international perspectives of university programs, and even
incorporating specialized international planning subjects into
the syllabus. The scholarly assumption appears to be that
internationalizing the planning curriculum provides an oppor-
tunity to introduce diversity, multiculturalism, and cultural
differentiation into education; processes that theorists such as
Friedmann (1996) lamented to be understudied in planning.
Other scholars, such as Goldstein, Bollens, Feser, and Silver
(2006), contend that the internationalization of planning edu-
cation strengthens the foundations of cross-cultural sensitiv-
ity in students, which not only ensures they are prepared to
meet the expectations of a diverse marketplace but also equips
students with the skills of diversity management required by
modern organizations. Correspondingly, Alterman's (1992)
empirical critique of planning practice and education imply
that failure to incorporate an international perspective into the
university program limits students understanding of the con-
texts in which planning practice and education occur cross-
nationally, and he recommended educating students about
other countries to enhance their appreciation of planning
processes.
It is evident in the literature that students who receive an
internationally focused higher education are more responsive
to global market forces, have enhanced social and cultural
awareness, and are better prepared to cope with the ramifica-
tions of significant political change (e.g., Coates & Edwards,
2009; J. Knight, 2003). Furthermore, opportunities for inter-
national immersion can expand horizons for students, aca-
demic researchers, and the broader university institution;
achieved through facilitating cooperative working relation-
ships across partner universities and generating high-quality
Yigitcanlar 3
research products that can be used to inform professional
practice as well as contribute to the advancement of the
existing body of applied knowledge (P. Knight & Yorke,
2004). Some planning theorists (e.g., Abramson, 2005;
Goldstein et al., 2006) argue that international immersion
provides students with more marketable skills in the work-
place, in particular, the ability to apply cross-cultural knowl-
edge, and highlight the value of international field trips in
expanding traditional pedagogy and practice to an interna-
tional setting and understanding. Similarly, Afshar (2001)
supported the view that international pedagogical experi-
ences provide the participants with an opportunity to acquire
knowledge through action across a broad range of institu-
tional and cultural contexts; and is invaluable to the develop-
ment of a reflective planning practitioner.
Abramson (2005) underlined the usefulness of a series of
intense field trips integrated with a continuous relationship
of academic exchange and ongoing research to engage stu-
dents and academics from both countries as a means for dis-
covering the differences in planning culture that exist across
nations. He predicts that in the foreseeable future, the effec-
tiveness of planning professionals would largely depend on
the ability of their work to transcend international boundar-
ies, and stated "as greater numbers of planning consultancies
practice across national borders, the local embeddedness of
actual planning conditions presents a major problem for the
training of planning professionals" (p. 101). On this point,
Taylor and Finley (2011) highlighted the value addition of
international field trips not only by enhancing teaching and
learning capabilities, developing research partnerships, and
widening organizational resources; but also by equipping
students with the skills and knowledge to function profes-
sionally across diverse cultures.
Similarly, Ali and Doan (2006) identified international
field trips to be one of the most innovative methods of
enhancing student understanding of planning processes and
complexities of diverse cultural, economic, and political
systems. They emphasized that this type of pedagogical
experience constitutes an effective application of integrating
an international perspective into the curriculum, as it creates
international research partnerships for the development of
intercultural skills and understanding of global processes,
rather than just marketing university's programs and stu-
dents internationally.
International field trips are widely claimed and regarded
as an important part of the higher education experience that
students have a firsthand, hands-on, and problem-based real-
world learning experience in a different setting from their
own country (Hefferan, Heywood, & Ritter, 2002; Hovorka
& Wolf, 2009; Pawson & Teather, 2002; Stronkhorst, 2005).
To scientifically prove these claims, Houser et al. (2011)
undertook an objective analysis of student comprehension
and retention of course material through a comparison of test
performance between students who participated in an inter-
national field trip and their peers who did not. The findings
of this study revealed that international field trips improve
cognitive learning. They stated,
the key finding of this study is that fieldtrip students [received]
significantly higher exam scores, as compared to their peers not
involved in the study abroad fieldtrip . . . Fieldtrips have
significant social and affective outcomes that contribute toward
improved learning outcomes and test performance. (p. 526)
According to Dee, Tsui, Lee, and Yigitcanlar (2011),
the importance of international planning education in facilitating
a deeper understanding of cultural diversity and exposing
students to new ways of thinking cannot be underestimated. In
an era of globalization and wireless technology, international
collaborative planning projects can equip graduates with the
skills necessary for professional practice in a national or
international context. (p. 72)
In summary, while there are various means that are
employed by universities to internationalize their course con-
tent, an increasingly popular means of internationalizing the
content of education is the incorporation of field trips into the
curriculum. International field trips, thus, have the potential
to play a significant role in helping universities to respond to
the demands of globalization and rapidly changing economic,
sociocultural, political, and environmental conditions.
Depending on how well they are organized, field trips can be
academically thorough and can create a cultural experience
useful in the globalizing world, and the exposure provides an
opportunity for students to develop their intercultural compe-
tence. As Khan (2009) stated, this is a valuable attribute for
planning professionals, making them job ready for an expand-
ing and increasingly international job market.
Evaluating the Learning Outcomes of
International Field Trips
Regional planning practice course of the urban and regional
planning undergraduate program at QUT offers 4th-year
planning students an opportunity to develop their knowl-
edge and skills for effective strategic planning and coordi-
nation of a positive metropolitan regional change in an
international context. Since 2008, each year, this course has
been choosing a metropolitan region from abroad as a case
study for students to (a) demonstrate an understanding and
capability to apply planning theories and principles, (b) review
planning methods critically, (c) create effective strategic
development frameworks, and (d) integrate and apply the
practice material taught. Although organizing an interna-
tional field trip is not a requirement of the Planning Institute
of Australia--professional course accreditation body in
Australia--this course includes an international field trip of
about 2 weeks to the metropolitan region under investiga-
tion to improve student competency in addressing intercul-
tural planning and development issues.
4 SAGE Open
These international planning exercises were specifically
designed to enhance teaching and learning capacities,
develop teaching partnerships, and provide students with
skills and competencies to function professionally in a mul-
ticultural context. As part of this course, between 2008 and
2011, four international field trips were organized to Kuala
Lumpur (Malaysia), Daejeon (Korea), Gallipoli (Turkey),
and Taipei (Taiwan) from Brisbane (Australia). As recom-
mended by Edwards (2009), these international field trips
were planned as "the optimal model" for positive learning
outcomes by being linked with the project started in the
classroom and continued after the return from the trip.
From each year's regional planning practice class, where
approximately 80 to 90 students enrolled, up to 30 of them,
based on first-come-first-served method, have been chosen
to participate in the international field trips (for the enroll-
ment numbers, see Table 5). During the first three deliveries
of the course (2008-2010) while international field trip par-
ticipants' project focused on the international metropolitan
region they visited, a local project from the local metropoli-
tan region (Brisbane) has been assigned to the rest of the
class as their study region. At the last delivery of the course
(2011), the entire class took the same international metro-
politan region (Taipei) as the case study area.
Planning and preparation of field trip activities com-
menced about a year before the trip and continued in strong
collaboration with hosting universities. Several funding
resources from QUT were channeled for these trips to
become as affordable as possible for the participating stu-
dents. In all four field trips, while students covered the cost
of their own air travel, their accommodation, meals, travel
insurance, and field trip­related technical expenses were
covered by QUT, and the hosting universities covered the
local transportation, local seminar, and forum speakers'
expenses and venue hiring costs.
The field trip destinations were carefully selected consid-
ering the following key criteria: (a) study area providing a
unique real-world planning problem that would help students
to enrich their comprehension of planning issues beyond
Australia; (b) data and information availability of the case
study region in English; (c) good ties with the hosting institu-
tions, which secures the local delivery and quality of lec-
tures, workshops, site visits, and surveys; (d) participation of
local university professors and students in the activities; and
(e) affordability of the field trip for students. Table 1 lists the
details of the international field trips and participants.
These field trips were collaborative exercises organized
jointly by visiting (QUT) and hosting universities and
scheduled for the first 2 weeks of the semester--at the last
week of July and first week of August every year between
2008 and 2011. During this period, visiting students (in
total 94 QUT students) worked with hosting university stu-
dents (in total 78), under the supervision of professors (in
total 15 from QUT, 16 from hosting universities) in collect-
ing the relevant information for preparing regional devel-
opment plan proposals in the following 12 weeks after the
field trip. Regional planning practice course, in terms of
outputs, consisted of a regional appraisal (field trip report),
regional activity analysis report (expanded version of field
trip report including review of the relevant literature), and
regional development plan proposal (plan and accompany-
ing report detailing vision, objectives, key development
strategies, and actions). During the field trips, students of
visiting and hosting universities worked in groups under
the supervision of their professors to prepare the first out-
put of the course (i.e., field trip report) and participated in
the activities listed in Table 2.
After the field trips, hosting university planning students
kept in touch and supported QUT students with additional
information and local knowledge. The regional planning

practice course, at the end of the semester, culminated with
the presentation of the regional development plan proposals
prepared for the visited case study areas by QUT students.
The hosting university students and professors were invited
to attend the final presentations. However, due to time and
financial constraints, attendance of the hosting university
student and staff for the final event of the project in Brisbane
could not be materialized.
The following section reports the evaluation method,
analysis, and results of the learning outcomes from the four
international field trip experiences, including assignment
performance differences between the student groups who
participated and who did not participate in the international
field trips.
Method, Analysis, and Results
Focus group discussions, interviews, and surveys are among
the commonly applied qualitative and quantitative methods
in evaluating teaching and learning outcomes (e.g., Houser
et al., 2011; Isoardi, 2010). To best capture and analyze the
opportunities and constraints of exposure of students to
international planning practice, the research methodology
includes semistructured interviews with student focus
groups and structured field trip evaluation surveys with stu-
dents. These interviews and surveys (on top of QUT's stan-
dard teaching and learning surveys) were conducted at the
end of the semester (n = 24 and n = 77, respectively). The
purpose of waiting about 3 months after each field trip was
to get a much clearer and settled view from the students on
what level the international collaboration improved their
skills and competencies, and contributed to their profes-
sional and personal development. In addition to the focus
group interview and survey techniques, a validity check was
conducted by involving professors, who attended these
international field trips, through informal discussions on the
results of student interviews and surveys (n = 11). Finally, a
performance analysis has been undertaken to measure and
shed light on the achievements of international field trip
participants in three of the assessment items in comparison
with their peers who had not participated in international
field trips.
Student Focus Group Interviews
The first analysis of the research was conducting inter-
views with selected student participants of international
field trips. Semistructured interviews were undertaken for
each field trip during the last week of the semester with
randomly selected six QUT students, forming a focus
group, to reflect the outcomes of international field trip
experiences (n = 24).
From these conversations, we found out that almost all
interviewed students view the international activity as an
extremely positive contribution to their professional and per-
sonal development. Interviewee S19 (Student Number 19)
put forward,
[field trip] was an amazing journey in my university education,
it made me open my eyes to the issues beyond Australia . . . This
is a perfect experience for engaging us with an overseas real-
world practice, while motivating and triggering our curiosity.

Some interviewees reflected on the contributions of learn-
ing from problem-oriented fieldwork. Interviewee S13
stated, "I gained new insights, perspectives and technical
skills from this international project, as we worked on an
international real-world problem-based project . . . This proj-
ect broadened my vision and helped me to see the big
picture."
Some interviewees highlighted the contributions of the
international social interaction on their technical abilities.
Interviewee S10 stated,
although the field trip was an innovative way of teaching and
equipping us with technical experience, the most important
aspects of it were to provide us an opportunity of working in
international teams, and increasing professional self-confidence
levels and developing cross-cultural social skills.
Beyond this, especially networking and building new
friendships dimensions of the field trips were frequently
voiced as a positive method of encouraging student learning
while having a good time and making new friends.
The comments of Interviewee S23 on his personal obser-
vations and suggestions reflect most of the students' com-
mon view on this international collaboration. As he said,
the overall field trip was an invaluable experience, I have
personally learned a lot from the joint work with my peers [in
the visited country]. The trip provided me with an insight into
international planning issues, cultural complexities, and the
importance of governance within the planning framework. I
would recommend the trip to all planning students. This type
of field trips and experiences broaden our perspectives and
create a thirst for learning more about other countries' way of
planning.
Finally, the use of new technology and techniques during
the project was also mentioned along with interviewees see-
ing themselves getting equipped with international knowl-
edge in the discipline area, which may lead to overseas
employment opportunities.
On the downside, there were some concerns that were con-
sidered as constructive comments for the future field trips.
There was a repeated comment on the length of the trip to be
extended further as the field trip was found not having enough
contact time with local professionals to provide students with
an opportunity to engage with a wide range of discussion and
in-depth analysis. According to Interviewee S18,
visiting the local planning departments and learning about
local planning practice within another country provides a new
platform from which I can now look at planning theories and
practice in my area, and challenge the accepted norms.
However, it would have been great to spend more time with
these experts to get a much more detail information on the case
study area.
Another point was on the cultural and language differ-
ences not helping to follow and join discussions and com-
municate with local people and local activist group
representatives. According to Interviewee S5, "the level
of detail we were able to obtain and evaluate didn't always
flow down to local policies due to issues such as language
differences." Interviewee S7 agrees on this view and adds
on, "the workshop and lecture contents were very good,
but sometimes the language barrier was a problem for us
to fully follow the lecture and join the discussion after-
wards." Interviewee S2 said, "the activities were good;
however they were too focused on the government per-
spective and needed more focus on community groups and
activists, and urban problems that need to be resolved
immediately."
The next key issue was related to the organization of the
planning practice and policy development collaboration
that provides enough time for students to get to know about
each others' culture and planning systems. On that matter,
Interviewee S12 stated, "[we] probably need a session to
explain both universities' education in terms of planning
and discussing planning processes in both countries in
more detail." On the very same subject, Interviewee S20
underlined the need for a denser collaboration by saying,
"more closeness required learning from each other. Thus,
this will break the cultural barriers between two university
students . . . Perhaps home-stay during the field trip might
be useful."
Difficulty of arranging regular weekly contact time with
hosting university students to complete the project following
the field trip was raised as a concern. Interviewee S19
mentioned,
cooperating with [local] students was very helpful for us . . .
[Case study area] is extremely sensitive region not only
historically but also environmentally and an outside view on the
development and protection strategies would make a great
contribution. Nevertheless, following this unique and different
planning experience it was quite challenging to keep regular
online meetings via emails, instant messengers or Skype to
further develop the project.
Finally, beyond aforementioned issues, logistic limita-
tions (particularly in Western standards), field trips being
physically demanding for some, limited interpersonal skills
of hosting university students (most likely due to cultural
characteristics or shyness), involving rather a one-way
knowledge transfer (concerning of hosting university stu-
dents), and limited funding for students were mentioned as
other key constraints of these field trips.
The following summary, listed in Table 3, was captured
from the focus group interviews (2008-2011) as the main
issues concerning opportunities and constraints of the field
trip experiences.

Student Evaluation Surveys
The second analysis was conducting structured surveys with
student participants of international field trips. Survey ques-
tionnaires, consisting of 31 questions with five Likert-type
scale response options, were sent to QUT students by email.
The student survey response rates were 81.75%, 85.71%,
84.00%, and 76.00% for the Kuala Lumpur, Daejeon,
Gallipoli, and Taipei field trips, respectively. The 4-year
average response rate was 81.91% (n = 77). The combined
4-year results of the student surveys, undertaken between
2008 and 2011, are presented in Table 4.
Perfectly aligned with what McLean, Hurd, and Rogers
(2007) put forward, Kuala Lumpur, Daejeon, Gallipoli, and
Taipei field trips have been perceived as quite attractive,
because students, particularly the "Y generations," saw them
as opportunities to combine leisure activity (e.g., traveling,
seeing new places, and expanding social networks) with edu-
cation (e.g., study away from university and home). The
highlights of these results are illustrated in Figure 1, and the
main issues from the conducted surveys between 2008 and
2011 are presented and discussed below.
In terms of overall findings of the field trips, in total, 28%
of respondents had "strong agreement" on the benefits of
planning field trips, whereas other 56% had "agreement"
(total 84% satisfaction rate). The students almost had a con-
sensus on (above 90% satisfaction rate) the following points:
(Q1) Field trip was a valuable experience for my profes-
sional growth and development;
(Q2) Field trip was a valuable experience for my personal
growth and development;
(Q4) I highly recommend this field trip to other students
and universities;
(Q7) Field trip provided me an understanding of alterna-
tive sets of planning objectives and processes;
(Q18) Field trip enhanced my understanding of diversity
in my social and organizational surroundings;
(Q19) Field trip improved my ability to communicate in a
multicultural or foreign environment;
(Q20) Field trip improved my ability to communicate
with people from different countries or cultures;
(Q21) Field trip helped me build networks and cooperative
work with students and faculty from my university;
(Q24) Field trip was valuable to my understanding of
international planning issues;
(Q27) Students contributed positively to the overall qual-
ity of the experience, and;
(Q28) Professors contributed positively to the overall
quality of the experience.
There was only in total 7% of combined "disagreement"
(3%) and "strong disagreement" (4%) on some of the issues.
The main disagreements (above 10% dissatisfaction rate)
were the following (however, the satisfaction rates range
between 63% and 78% for all of these issues):
(Q5) Field trip enhanced my qualifications to pursue a
professional career, domestically;
(Q6) Field trip enhanced my qualifications to pursue a
professional career, internationally;
(Q12) Field trip equipped me with skills to respond effec-
tively to unfamiliar problems in my professional career;
(Q13) Field trip equipped me with skills to respond effec-
tively to unfamiliar problems in my university
education;
(Q17) Planning education in my university performs at
high level, internationally;

(Q26) Field trip lectures were appropriate for achieving
an understanding of planning issues, and;
(Q29) Professors were helpful in providing information
on the region before the field trip.
The results of the surveys overlap perfectly well with the
findings of the student focus group interviews. The survey
results backed up the interview findings indicating interna-
tional field trips as a significant contribution to student learn-
ing, professional and personal growth, understanding
diversity and international issues, having a big picture per-
spective and building networks of cooperative work with
increased student competency and communication abilities.
These outcomes perfectly fulfill the objective of the course
and the planning program at QUT. On the downside, con-
straints raised at the interviews and surveys point out to first,
room for improvement in the organization of field trips, and
second, insufficiency of just one international field trip in the
entire undergraduate planning education to build student
knowledge, skills, and confidence to the highest level on the
international planning practice.
Professor Interviews
The third analysis of the research was conducted to capture
the views of participant professors on the international field
trips and at the same time check the validity of student
responses collected by focus group interviews and surveys
with their professors. The results from interviews and sur-
veys were shared with professors from visiting and hosting
universities and then informal discussions held with them
either face-to-face or over the Internet via tele- or video-
conferencing to record their feedback on and responses to
the findings. In total, eight professors from the hosting uni-
versities and three from QUT participated to this exercise
(n = 11).
In consensus, this group of professors confirmed the
validity of student responses and agreed on the highly positive
Figure 1. Highlights of the international field trip evaluation surveys.
Note: Positive values indicate student satisfaction levels and negative ones dissatisfaction.

contributions of conducted international field trips to student
learning and professional and personal growth. The follow-
ing views, on the contribution of international field trips to
student learning outcomes, most adequately summarize the
opinions of the professorial group who participated in the
informal discussions and provided their feedback.
According to Interviewee P3 (Professor Number 3),
planning exercises jointly conducted with overseas universities
are not only teaching our students the cross-cultural dimensions
of the discipline, equipping them with techniques on how to
better deal with the urbanization problems of the new century,
and increasing their job readiness in the highly globalizing
world, but also significantly contributing to their personal
development by giving them confidence they need when they
face new [and unfamiliar] problems, helping them to think out
of the box, increasing their curiosity to learn and research, and
becoming more open and respectful to the different cultures,
traditions, voices, and perspectives of others.
Interviewee P8 stated,
[i]n the world we live in today, taking students out of the country
for a problem-oriented fieldwork is the new fashion of taking
students out of classrooms for learning by experience . . . This
way, the interaction and learning increases exponentially as a
result of experience boosted and triggered by the new, foreign
and challenging environment. And [as in this joint planning
exercise] it leads to better learning outcomes than most of the
traditional classroom-based instruction.
Perhaps, most remarkable comment was potentially these
international collaboration to
generate a new type of student/professional that not only
confident in the practice of the discipline as much as the
conceptual dimensions of it, but also preparing themselves for
better understanding and solving the problems of global
communities of the world . . . and eventually contributing to the
world peace and sustainable development. (Interviewee P6)
Some issues identified from the collaborative study
related to the students having more information provided
about the host country prior to commencement of the trip and
having some shorter days during the study tour so that stu-
dents are not overwhelmed by the full trip itinerary. Another
issue related to language and cultural barriers which at times
prevented effective communication, however on reflection,
many students came to regard this as part of the experience
and a way to develop intercultural communication skills.
The final issue raised in the interviews was the financial
burden of these trips to the teaching staff.All professors were
volunteered to take part in these activities with no payment
for their time. Beyond this, almost all hosting and visiting
professors spent a reasonable amount from their pocket in
these trips as the funding from their universities only covered
parts of their basic expenses. This brings us to the conclusion
of the necessity of these international field trips to be included
in the curriculum with a significant amount of funding to
secure the sustainability of these international interactions.
Student Performance Analysis
The final analysis of the research was the performance analy-
sis. This analysis was conducted to check whether the inter-
national field trip actually contributed positively to the
learning of the students. The research used the marks stu-
dents received from their three assignments and the final
grade of the course as the metrics of learning (similar to
Houser et al., 2011). The analysis, for determining the contri-
butions of the international field trips, compared the marks
received between the students who participated in an interna-
tional field trip and their peers who did not. As mentioned
earlier, in the first three deliveries (2008-2010) of the regional
planning practice course, local projects were assigned to the
part of the class who did not participate in international field
trips. Only at the last delivery (2011) of the course, students
who did not attend the field trip were also asked to take the
same international project. In all four deliveries of the course,
the assessment criteria were kept exactly identical regardless
of students' involvement in an international project.
Table 5 depicts the student achievement differences, con-
cerning three assignments and the final grades, between
those who attended (n = 94) and had not attended (n = 243)
to international field trips between 2008 and 2011. The
results, for the 4-year average, indicate more than a 10%
(10.34%) improved final grade for those who attended the
international field trip. For the 4-year average, when each of
the three assignment results were put under microscope, the
highest mark increase was recorded in Assignment 1
(17.93%) that is most likely due to the nature of the assess-
ment item (regional appraisal) being a field trip report and
prepared with intense engagement of students with the case
study region. The lowest increase was recorded for
Assignment 2 (5.22%). This is again most likely due to the
nature of assessment item (regional activity analysis report
including a thorough review of the relevant literature) involv-
ing literature review that can be conducted equally as good
by the students who did not participate in the international
field trip. The second highest performance increase was
recorded for Assignment 3 (10.60%). This also can be
explained due to the nature of the assessment item (regional
development plan proposal) focusing on the preparation of a
development plan for the case study area.
During all four deliveries of the course, the analysis find-
ings point out to quite a high-level assignment score achieve-
ment of the students who participated to the international
field trip compared with their peers who did not (i.e., between
1.48% and 28.41% increase). These findings are very much
in line with the empirical study findings (students partici-
pated in international field trip n = 20 and who did not n =
365) of Houser et al. (2011), which indicate significant con-
Yigitcanlar 11
tribution of international field trip to improving test perfor-
mance through engagement and new social networks.
Conclusion
The experiences from the international field trips reported in
this article confirm, in line with the literature findings, that
international study collaborations reinforce the realization of
the key objective of urban and regional planning courses--
that is, in the case of QUT: providing knowledge, skills, and
hands-on experiences to students for them to be able to work
under diverse urban and regional contexts and be able to
respond and address complex urban and regional problems.
International field trips set a new dimension in the way visit-
ing and hosting organizations run their degree in planning
and conduct courses particularly that have global implica-
tions. These international field trips exposed students to vari-
ous aspects of planning, their complexities, similarities, and
differences in an international context that have contributed
student learning, competency, skills, and capabilities.
The interview and survey results of participating students,
performance analysis of international field trip participants
in comparison with their peers who did not participated in
these field trips, and informal discussions with professors
from visiting and hosting universities highlight the benefits
of such international field trips in terms of student learning
experience and exposure to different cultural contexts. From
the student perspective, the experience has proven invaluable
in terms of cross-cultural engagement and developing inter-
national networks as for most of the students, being involved
in an international exercise was a unique experience in their
education and professional career and beyond this in their
personal growth. From the professors' perspective, the expo-
sure to different planning processes and practices gave stu-
dents a new outlook on what they knew from their own
country as well as some insights on international planning
issues and cultural differences and barriers.
The analyses results revealed that, on one hand, exposure of
students to international planning practice is a big opportunity
and incorporating international field trips in the planning cur-
riculum is an effective method for achieving a more holistic
educational experience and cultivating the pedagogy of experi-
ence, while internationalizing the education. On the other hand,
some of the organization and logistics constraints and chal-
lenges need attention to increase the student satisfaction and
the success level of prospective international field trips.
In line with the findings of Dee et al. (2011), the key inter-
national regional planning collaboration findings highlighted
in this article indicate that (a) greater depth is added to the
urban and regional planning course from international study
collaborations, (b) students developed intercultural skills
that are an asset in professional practice when faced with
diverse and complex planning issues, (c) professors extended
their teaching (and also research) collaboration, and (d)
Students are exposed to different planning systems and pro-
cesses, which challenge existing outlooks and encourage cre-
ativity and innovation.
The outcomes of the international field trip experiences
have potentials to shed some light on formulation of the 21st-
century planning education considering the challenges of the
rapidly changing and globalizing world. This article, besides,
provides useful insights on how to develop an international
field trip and combine activities mentioned earlier in the arti-
cle with the trip. The evolution of the activities over time is
also a useful learning for other schools planning to conduct
such international activities. Finally, perhaps as stated by a
field trip participant professor (Interviewee P1), such "inter-
national collaboration experience may foster professionals
that contributes the world to become a better place by being
open and understanding the others."
