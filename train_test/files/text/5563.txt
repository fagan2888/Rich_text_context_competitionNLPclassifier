Introduction
Strong evidence exists for racial differences in cardiac
response to certain physiological and pathological stimuli.
For instance, Afro-Caribbean patients with systemic hyper-
tension show a significantly higher mean left ventricular
diameter compared with hypertensive Caucasians.1 Very
little is known about African athletes, even less about
Egyptian.
Physiological adaptation to regular static and dynamic
training has been previously reported. Intensive and pro-
longed physical training leads to cardiovascular adjust-
ments that allow for an exceptional physical performance
of athletic heart.2­6
Echocardiographic studies documented typical morpho-
logic changes in the left ventricle (LV), such as the increase
in end diastolic diameter (EDD), myocardial wall thickness
and myocardial mass, which correspond to eccentric hyper-
trophy.7 In contrast, only limited data are available on the
right ventricle (RV), because of its complex shape and
marked trabeculations, which may exceed the validity and
reliability of echocardiography.8
Plasma and tissue concentration of angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) are determined by the ACE gene (chromo-
some 17q23). An important polymorphism in this gene
comprises the insertion (I) or deletion (D) of a 287-bp in
intron 16 of the gene. Studies showed that the homozygous
DD genotype is associated with increased serum ACE
level9 and cardiac ACE activity.10
In view of its potential effect, we aimed in this study to
determine the effect of ACE I/D gene polymorphism on the
extent of functional and structural cardiac changes in

Abstract
Background: The renin­angiotensin­aldosterone system plays a role in physiological and pathological responses of the
heart to both static and dynamic exercise. Previous studies showed that the level of angiotensin II is determined by the
angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D) polymorphism.
Aim: We aimed in this study to determine the effect of ACE I/D gene polymorphism on the extent of functional and
structural cardiac changes in response to one year of professional football training in young footballers.
Methods and results: We studied 68 young male football players and a comparable control group. Besides medical history
and clinical examination, 12 lead ECG and transthoracic 2D echocardiography examination were performed. Genotyping
of ACE was analyzed using PCR-based technique. There was no statistically significant difference in distribution of geno-
types among athletes compared with control subjects. D allele showed a graded effect on both EF (73.55, 67.5 and 60.2%,
p=0.03) and PASP (37.6, 26.1 and 21.39 mmHg, p=0.02) in DD, ID and II subjects, respectively.
Conclusion: Early cardiac changes in young footballers can be affected by ACE I/D polymorphism. There is a summative
effect of the D allele in increasing EF and PASP in response to professional football training.

response to one year of professional football training in
young Egyptian athletes.
Methods
Subjects
Football players trained for selection in the Egyptian Young
World Cup National team were invited to join this study.
During the follow-up year 68 out of 75 young athletes (par-
ticipation 90.7%) aged 17­21 years with football as their
main training modality gave their written informed consent
to take part in the study (according to the instructions and
regulations of the Medical Ethics Committee in Cairo
University). The control group consisted of 100 age-, sex-,
height- and weight-matched, non-smoking, sedentary, third
year students studying at the medical school, Cairo
University. None of them exercised for more than 30 min-
utes per week. After being given complete information
about the study, participants signed consent. All athletes
and control subjects were asymptomatic Egyptians coming
for different parts of the country. They are free from cardiac
disease. None of them was known to be using anabolic ster-
oids or any other medications that may cause cardiac
hypertrophy.
Study protocol
The study protocol was approved by the ethics Committee
of Kasr El-Eini Medical School, Cairo University. The sub-
jects participated in 2D-echocardiographic and Doppler
study at rest.
Echocardiographic measurements
Echocardiographic and Doppler studies were performed
usinganEsaoteMyLab30Echomachine.Echocardiographic
examination was performed with the subject at rest, lying in
left lateral decubitus position. Both standard parasternal
views (long and short axis) and apical views (four-, two-
and three-chamber) were obtained. An integrated M-mode
and two-dimensional study was done, consistent with the
recommendations of the American Society of Echo
cardiography11 and the European Association of Echo
cardiography recommendations.12 The LV mass was
calculated using the formula of Devereux.13 LV wall ten-
sion (WT) was calculated using the following formula:14
WT (dyn/cm) = 1.33 × systolic blood pressure × (LV end
systolic diameter)/2. Measurements were quoted with body
surface area (BSA) calculated with the formula of Dubois
and Dubois.15 Each measurement was made on three con-
secutive cardiac cycles and an average of the three values
was considered. The static and dynamic images were
reviewed by another echocardiographer for the purpose of
excluding criteria for pathological hypertrophy in the ath-
lete group.
Genotyping of the ACE gene I/D
polymorphism
After obtaining informed consent for inclusion into the
study from the parents, genomic DNA was extracted from
200 l of whole blood with EZ-10 Spin column DNA
extraction minipreps kit (Biobasic Company, Canada).
The I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene was determined
according to the method of Rigat et al.16 The sequences of
the sense and antisense primers were 5-CTG GAG ACC
ACT CCC ATC CTT TCT-3 and 5-GAT GTG GCC ATC
ACA TTC GTC AGA T-3, respectively (prepared by
AM-Egypt). PCR was performed in a final volume of 50
l that contained 25 l master mix, 500 ng of genomic
DNA, 12.5 pmol of each primer and 5% dimethylsulfox-
ide (DMSO). Amplification was performed using a Gene
Amp PCR system 2400­Perkin Elmer. Samples were
denatured for 1 min at 94°C and then cycled 30 times
through the following steps: 45 s at 94°C, 1 min at 62°C,
1 min at 72°C. PCR products were electrophoresed in
1.6% agarose gel and visualized directly with ethidium
bromide staining. The I allele was detected as a 490-bp
band, and the D allele was detected as a 190-bp band
(Figure 1). DMSO was included in the PCR to prevent
underestimation of heterozygotes and overestimation of
the DD genotype. A second PCR amplification was per-
formed for each DD type with a primer pair that recog-
nizes an insertion-specific sequence (5- TGG GAC CAC
AGC GCC CGC CAC TAC-3; 5-TCG CCA GCC CTC
CCA TGC CCA TAA-3), with identical PCR conditions
except for an annealing temperature of 67°C and the
absence of 5% DMSO17 (Figure 2).

and control groups. A computer software package (SPSS),
version 15, was used in the analysis. For quantitative vari-
ables,meanandstandarddeviationarepresented.Frequency
and percentage are presented for qualitative variables. Chi
square/Fisher's Exact were used to estimate differences in
qualitative variables. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
used to measure differences among the three genotypes. An
alpha error level of p<0.05 was considered as statistically
significant.
Results
Football players recruited for the National Youth Football
Team were selected from amateur footballers who were
used to participating in irregular football playing for
3­4.5 h/week for 5±1 years prior to joining the National
Team. After their recruitment, they were under a regular
training program including both endurance and strength
components for 13 h/week (2 h static exercises + 11 h
dynamic training/week).
The distribution of ACE gene I/D polymorphism in both
footballers and control groups is shown in Table 1. Different
genotypes as well as the distribution of either I or D alleles
were analyzed. There are no statistically significant differ-
ences between the two groups.
Table 2 shows the clinical characteristics of the study
group. Both footballers and control subjects are matched
regarding age, height, weight, body surface area and body
mass index.
Table 3 shows the electrocardiographic measurements
of football players and the control group. Differences
between the two groups were not statistically significant
apart from the heart rate.
Echocardiographic examination showed statistically
significant differences between both groups. The footballer
group showed significantly higher LV mass (p = 0.027) and
ejection fraction (EF) (p = 0.02). Footballers showed lower
WT and lower pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP),
p<0.001 (Table 4).
We focused on those echocardiographic parameters that
showed significant differences between the two groups and
studied whether there is an effect of ACE I/D polymor-
phisms (Table 5).
EF showed significant differences among DD, ID and II
genotypes, with DD genotype having the highest EF
(73.55%), with ID 67.5% and II 60.2%. There was also sig-
nificantly higher PASP in footballers with DD genotype
(37.6 mmHg) as compared with II genotype (21.39 mmHg).
This was reflected on the right ventricular diameter (RVd),
(25.95±3.5 and 22.38±2.9 mm in DD and II genotypes,
respectively). Other parameters showed no statistically sig-
nificant differences although the effect of DD allele appeared
to be summative. Such an effect of D allele was not observed
among different genotypes in the control group. Although
EF was highest in the DD genotype (63.72%), this was not
statistically significant from the other two groups (60.1%
and 59.8% in ID and II sub-groups, respectively, p = 0.18).
Similarly, mean RVd was 22.8, 22.39 and 22.52 mm in DD,
ID and II sub-groups, respectively (p = 0.38) and mean
PASP was 15.21, 15.1 and 15.8 mmHg (p = 0.67).

Discussion
The role of the renin­angiotensin­aldosterone system in
promoting physiological and pathological responses in the
heart has been established. Previous investigations showed
varied and sometimes paradoxical results regarding the
effect of I/D gene polymorphism in response to physical
training.18,19
The ACE DD genotype is associated with increased cir-
culating ACE levels, which are generally two times as high
as those found for the II genotype; ID heterozygotes are
associated with intermediate ACE levels.9
Regarding genotype frequency, both footballers and con-
trols showed similar distribution with ID genotype being the
most common (50% in footballers and 49% in controls), fol-
lowed by DD genotype (38.2% and 39%) and II, which
showed the least frequency (11.8% and 12%). Our results
are comparable to previous studies made in Egyptian popu-
lations.20 Settin et al. showed different results (DD=47.5%,
ID 47.5% and II 5%).21 This discrepancy may be due to the
heterogeneity of the Egyptian population and the relatively
small number of subjects in both investigations.
In contrast to our investigation, a number of studies
showed an association between ACE D allele and endur-
ance athletes in different populations.22,23
The distinction between physiological and pathological
conditions in athlete's heart is of great importance, as the
latter may result in critical implications for the athlete's
lifestyle and professional career.
In our study, we paid particular attention to the previ-
ously described criteria differentiating athlete's heart from
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).24,25 Family history
was explored. All echocardiographic images included in
the study were independently interpreted by two echocardi-
ographers to obtain the measurements; criteria of HCM
were cautiously sought for in all cases, in particular poste-
rior and septal wall thickness. Elite junior athletes have
greater absolute LV wall thickness, rarely exceeding 12mm,
and always with chamber enlargement.26
LV mass is significantly higher in athletes compared
with that of control subjects. As a combined endurance and
strength training, football training usually exposes the ath-
lete to a high pressure load that leads to a marked increase
in LV wall thickness and dimensions (both end systolic and
end diastolic).27 Further follow-up of our study population
will help highlight stepwise adaptive changes that sequen-
tially occur with continuing professional training.
Supportive of our results, previous studies showed sig-
nificant increase in LV wall thickness, diameter and mass in
athletes compared with controls in both Caucasians28 and
Africans.29
The effect of ACE I/D gene polymorphism on LV
mass in our study is obvious; there is a summative effect
of the presence of D allele, with DD genotype carriers
showing the highest LV mass, II showing the least and ID
showing an intermediate value. Previous studies showed
similar results in response to 10-week physical training in
male Caucasians19,30 as well as in strength-trained elite
athletes.31
It should be noted that such effect is a dynamic rather
than a static one. In concordance with our results, some
studies showed the effect of this gene polymorphism on the
LV mass in response to exercise,19 whereas others negated
the association of ACE I/D gene polymorphism and LV
mass in more than 2000 subjects from the Framingham
Heart Study of non-athletes.18
WT reflects the effect of the preload on the myocardium.
In our study the WT was significantly lower in athletes as
compared with controls, whereas a significant increase in
EF in the former was noticed. Calculation of both parame-
ters depends on the end systolic diameter. Our results are
supported by previous studies investigated Caucasian
athletes.19
Our study showed significant difference in both WT and
EF among the three genotypes, with cumulative effect of D
allele. Increased angiotensin II (Ang II) may lead to stiff-
ness of the cardiac muscle with resultant increase in WT.
Supporting our results, previous studies showed that ACE
DD and AT1R 1166 CC genotypes, concomitantly present,
increase the predisposition to diastolic heart failure.32
Few studies investigated the early adaptive right-sided
changes occurring in athlete's heart, especially in the
young. Our results showed a significant increase in PASP in
athletes in comparison with control subjects. In addition, a
significant increase in RV diameter followed.
High levels of physical activity in adults are associated
with greater RV mass and volume independent of the asso-
ciations with LV mass due to exercise-associated RV
remodeling.33
McQuillan et al. observed a wide spectrum of PASP in
normal subjects. They concluded that PASP varies indepen-
dently with age, BMI, male sex, LV posterior wall thick-
ness and LV ejection fraction.34
A recent study has shown that endurance-trained ath-
letes have a significantly higher PASP in comparison with
strength-trained athletes and control subjects.35 The study
concluded that the upper physiologic limit of PASP in
endurance athletes may reach up to 40mmHg. Although
this study was evaluating highly trained athletes, it can give
an explanation to our unexpected results of elevated PASP.
In our study, footballers with DD genotype showed an
increase in both LV mass and PASP. These findings can be
considered a physiologic consequence of long-term and
intensive exercise conditioning. The reduced peripheral
resistance that accompanies isotonic aerobic sports can
determine venous overload and consequent LV preload,
thus inducing greater LVEDD and LV stroke volume.36
Therefore, the higher PASP we noticed in this study may
be explained by the proportional increase in LV stroke
volume.
Saber-Ayad et al. 241
In our study, ACE gene polymorphism showed an effect
on both sides of the heart. The effect was significant on the
structure and function of the right side. DD genotype
showed a significantly higher PASP and RV diameter com-
pared with ID and II genotypes.
In concordance with our results, Kanazawa et al. showed
an association of ACE gene polymorphism with an increase
in mean pulmonary artery pressure as well as pulmonary
vascular resistance in response to exercise in chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.37 Similar results were
reported by Tkácová et al.38
The lungs are metabolically active organs that produceAng
II and endothelin among other peptides.39 Pulmonary vascular
tone is under the control of both vaso-active peptides.
In addition to its vaso-active property, Ang II also
induces proliferation and inflammation of the pulmonary
vasculature that contributes to the rise of pulmonary artery
pressure in both primary and secondary pulmonary hyper-
tension (e.g. in patients with chronic obstructive airway
disease).40,41 Recently, ACE2 enzyme was shown to be
a negative regulator of the angiotensin system (counter-
regulatory homolog of ACE). It metabolizes Ang II to a
putative protective peptide angiotensin (1-7) and leads to
vasodilatation and anti-proliferative effect.39 Therefore, it
is expected to be of therapeutic benefit in treating pulmo-
nary hypertension.40
The results of our study support the direct relationship
between the higher levels of ACE (and subsequently Ang
II) and the PASP, which showed a gradual rise according to
the number of D alleles.
In a recent study by Ventetuolo et al., the researchers
showed that RAS manipulation by using ACE inhibitors or
angiotensin receptor blockers was associated with lower RV
mass and smaller RV volumes among African Americans,
even after adjustment for respective LV measures and
spirometry. This gives indirect evidence that RAS manipu-
lation may uniquely affect RV morphology independent of
its effect on the LV.41 Further studies should investigate the
assumption that Ang II affects the pulmonary vasculature
earlier and more significantly than it does the systemic.
The balance between Ang II and Ang 1-7 seems to be
disturbed in individuals with DD genotype in favor of Ang
II. The D allele may be in linkage disequilibrium with
another causative variant in ACE2 gene that decreases the
enzyme level or activity, and suppresses the production of
Ang 1-7 in the lungs. Further studies are required to eluci-
date the role of this gene as a potential factor in determining
vascular resistance.
In addition, the preferential effect of Ang II/ACE2 on
the right side of the heart may be related to the higher enzy-
matic activity of the pulmonary circulation as compared
with the systemic.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that
investigated the role of ACE I/D gene polymorphism in an
African population, concerning early cardiac response to
professional training. Follow-up of our study population
may throw light on the significance and explanation of the
study results.
Limitations
We conducted the study on a relatively small number of
athletes and controls. We did not use relatively recent tech-
niques (tissue Doppler, 3D echocardiography and magnetic
resonance). We did not measure the volume or the function
of the right ventricle. Investigating the genes of the renin­
angiotensin­aldosterone system included only ACE I/D
polymorphism.
