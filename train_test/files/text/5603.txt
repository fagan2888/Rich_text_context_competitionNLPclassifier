Extraneous Effects of Race, Gender, and
Race-Gender Homo- and Heterophily
Conditions on Data Quality
A. Olu Oyinlade1 and Alex Losen1
Abstract
This study comprehensively investigated the differences in response patterns of interview respondents by race, gender, and
race-gender of both respondents and interviewers, to assess the impacts of response inconsistencies on data quality during
survey interviews. The study focused only on Blacks and Whites in various interview phily matches. Interviewees (N = 491)
responded to fully structured, closed-ended questions through direct interviews on support for affirmative action, and
support for the 2009 America's Affordable Health Choices Act as dependent variables. Findings showed various amounts
of response differences to both dependent variables by differences in race, gender, and race-gender of respondents, vis-à-
vis those of the interviewers', thereby constituting various amounts of data inconsistencies. The effects of race, gender, and
race-gender of both interviewers and respondents constitute potential nonrandom errors that must be controlled in
interview survey research, otherwise, research findings and conclusions may diverge from true relationships between
variables.

This study comprehensively analyzed differences in
interview response patterns by race, gender, and race-
gender (i.e., race plus gender) of respondents by differences
in race, gender, and race-gender of interviewers to
demonstrate the impacts of response inconsistencies on data
quality obtained during survey interviews. For decades,
several studies have identified interviewer effects as
pervasive in data collection (D. W. Davis, 1997a, 1997b;
Ellison, McFarland, & Krause, 2011; Krysan & Couper,
2003; Lievens & De Paepe, 2004; Tabane & Bouwer,
2006). According to Tabane and Bouwer (2006),
interviewer effects occur because the data collection
process is an interactional process involving power
relationships, which favors the interviewer over the
respondent. Consequent to interviewer effects, data
generated in an interview survey might reflect various
forms of inaccuracies and misinterpretations (D. W. Davis,
1997b).
To date, factors such as interviewer attitude (Durrant,
Groves, Staetsky, & Steele, 2010), age (Collins & Butcher,
1983), and education (Durrant et al., 2010) had been studied
relative to interviewer effects on data quality. The most
commonly studied interviewer effects, however, have been
race (D. W. Davis, 1997a, 1997b; D. W. Davis & Silver,
2003; Ellison et al., 2011; Januszka, Lora, Wollard, &
Rocco, 2007; Krysan & Couper, 2003; Lange, 2002;
Springman, Wherry, & Notaro, 2006; Webster, 1996) and
gender (R. E. Davis, Couper, Janz, Caldwell, & Resnicow,
2010; Dykema, Diloreto, Price, White & Schaeffer, 2012;
Flores-Macias & Lawson, 2008; Liu & Stainback, 2013;
Weinreb, 2006) of interviewer.
Race and Gender Effects
Overwhelmingly, studies on race-of-interviewer effects
have been predominant on Black1 respondents (D. W.
Davis, 1997a, 1997b; Ellison et al., 2011; Lievens & De
Paepe, 2004),with a result pattern that showed that Blacks
altered their responses to interview items based on the race
of their interviewers (Ellison et al., 2011; Webster, 1996).
For example, Blacks admitted to White1 interviewers than
to Black interviewers, that they (Blacks) lacked power to
change things or make a political difference through voting.
They (Blacks) also over reported having voted in an
election when interviewed by other Blacks than when
interviewed by Whites (D. W. Davis, 1997a). With specific
reference to older people, Ellison et al. (2011) found that
older Blacks claimed higher levels of non-organizational
religious practices when interviewed by Whites than by

Blacks. On race sensitive issues such as discrimination,
Krysan and Couper (2003) indicated that Blacks
significantly denied racial discrimination against
themselves when the interviewer was White but not when
the interviewer was a fellow Black.
Like Blacks, White respondents are also influenced by
race of the interviewer. Studies on White respondents (R. E.
Davis et al., 2010; Finkel, Guterbock, & Borg, 1991; Gong
& Aadland, 2011; Krysan & Couper, 2003) agreed that
Whites gave more liberal responses on race-related
questions when interviewed by Blacks than by Whites.
Whites also appear to acquiesce to race of interviewer on
racially sensitive issues (D. W. Davis, 1997a). Whites
interviewed by Blacks were reluctant to oppose racially
centered policies, and Whites also minimized their
tendencies for discrimination against Blacks when the
interviewer was Black but not when the interviewer was
White (D. W. Davis, 1997a; Krysan & Couper, 2003). In
addition, when the interviewer was White rather than Black,
White respondents strongly expressed trust of all Whites
and preference for an all-White community (Krysan &
Couper, 2003).
Patterns of gender-of-interviewer effects appear
inconsistent within and across studies. Flores-Macias and
Lawson (2008), for example, found gender-of-interviewer
effects in bivariate analysis in their Mexico City data, that
men interviewed by women identified women's rights as a
"very urgent" priority for the next president by 10
percentage points more than men interviewed by men. Also,
men interviewed by men were more likely to favor
criminalizing abortion in the case of rape, than men
interviewed by women. In the same study, however, Flores-
Macias and Lawson (2008) found women to be equally
progressive on abortion questions between men and women
interviewers, but they (women respondents) were less
progressive when interviewed by men on women's rights
questions. Also, in their Mexico national sample, Flores-
Macias and Lawson indicated that there were virtually no
differences in attitudes toward abortion among male
respondents by gender of interviewer, but women appear to
become more progressive on abortion when interviewed by
men than by women. Like Flores-Macias and Lawson
(2008), Liu and Stainback (2013) also found mixed results
in their study of gender-of-interviewer effects. They found
respondents to be more pro-marriage when interviewed by
women than by men interviewers, but they also indicated
that the likelihood of gender-of-interviewer effects was
inconsistent across their statistical models.
Other studies (Huddy et al., 1997; Kane & Macaulay,
1993) found gender effects to be significant such that
respondents acquiesced to the gender of the interviewer.
Gong and Aadland (2011) also found gender effects
wherein respondents demonstrated a significantly higher
willingness to pay for a curbside recycling program when
interviewed by women than when interviewed by men.
Weinreb (2006), however, found that women responded
similarly to women stranger-interviewers as to men
interviewers, but they (women respondents) gave different
answers to women-insider interviewers. Weinreb's findings
stressed that, except for the "insider situation" in which the
woman interviewer was a recognized member of a
community, women respondents did not show a general
pattern of difference in response to interview questions
based on gender of interviewer (Weinreb, 2006).
Objective
While many studies had been done on interviewer effects,
most have been done on race-of-interviewer effects with a
predominant focus on Black respondents (D. W. Davis,
1997a, 1997b; Ellison et al., 2011; Lange, 2002). Fewer
studies (e.g., Finkel, Guterbock, Marian, & Borg, 1991; Gong
& Aadland, 2011; Krysan & Couper, 2003) appeared to have
included White respondents. Unlike race-of-interviewer
effects, studies on gender-of-interviewer are much fewer,
despite the call by some studies (Oppenheim, 1992; Warren,
1988) for more rigorous analyses of gender-of-interviewer
influences on response behavior. Also, previous studies have
predominantly analyzed either the race or gender-of-
interviewer effects, but not both in the same study, and
studies that analyzed both race and gender effects in the same
study (e.g., Gong & Aadland, 2011) did not comprehensively
analyze all race-gender phily conditions in their analyses.
That is, a comprehensive analysis of differences in response
patterns by the combination of race, gender, and race-gender
of respondents, vis-à-vis those of the interviewer, have been
largely absent in previous studies. Based on the shortcomings
of previous studies, the objective of this study was to
comprehensively test for differences in interview response in
all possible phily matches involving race, gender, and race-
gender of both respondent and interviewer, between Blacks
and Whites, within the context of the same single study.
Theoretical Guide: Inconsequentiality
Versus Consequentiality of Interviewer
Effects
This study is guided by two competing theoretical
assumptions: the inconsequentiality versus consequentiality
of interviewer effects on data quality. Many studies on
interviewer effects (D. W. Davis, 1997a, 1997b; R. E. Davis
et al., 2010; Gong & Aadland, 2011; Krysan & Couper,
2003; Lievens & De Paepe, 2004; Springman et al., 2006;
Tabane & Bouwer, 2006) have concluded that interview
responses showed a structured (i.e., nonrandom)
relationship between interviewer and respondent
demographic characteristics, especially when a question
was race or gender sensitive. Some other studies (Allen,
Dawson, & Brown, 1989; Reese & Brown, 1995) have,
however, concluded that interviewer effects were
inconsequential to data quality. This position was earlier
Oyinlade and Losen 3
claimed by Schuman and Converse (1971) that differences
observed because of demographic characteristics of an
interviewer were just differences, rather than an indication
of greater or lesser accuracy of response. Schuman and
Converse contended that different answers to different
racial categories of interviewers did not demonstrate
evidence of data distortion or proof that the answers given
to one category were more valid than those given to
another. D. W. Davis (1997a), however, argued that to
ignore interviewer effects, such as the influence of race and
gender on data quality, was to ignore a legitimate source of
variance, capable of biasing data quality and statistical
analysis. In addition, to ignore the race-of-interviewer
effects on respondents is to fail to be sensitive to everyday
issues of race relations (D. W. Davis, 1997a).
Distorted data could result from both mono- and cross-
cultural conditions of data collection between interviewer
and respondent. In mono-cultural situations, people tend to
open up to each other and talk more freely about sensitive
issues than in cross-cultural conditions (Ghane, Kolk, &
Emmelkamp, 2010; Tabane & Bouwer, 2006). But, when
extreme demographic similarities exist between an
interviewer and an interviewee, the problem of potential
consensus (Webster, 1996), persuasion, and respondents'
tendency to align their views with those of the interviewer,
become highly realistic (Anderson & Alpert, 1974), and
capable of validating the discrete interaction distortion
hypothesis (Webster, 1996). This hypothesis states that "a
person is highly likely to distort his/her answers when
positive attraction and the subsequent desire to impress
exist in a temporary discrete interaction between two
parties" (Webster, 1996, p. 64). Cross-cultural interviewer-
respondent conditions tend to produce distorted data mainly
because such conditions are often marred by language
differences, lack of understanding of the other, and socio-
political insensitivity (Tabane & Bouwer, 2006).
To measure the likelihood of data distortion due to the
race and gender of both interviewers and respondents through
response inconsistences requires analyses of interview
responses under all possible phily conditions (homophilous
and heterophilous) between interviewer and interviewee.
Using race and gender of both interviewer and respondent for
phily matches, interview responses under all possible phily
matches (see Table 1) between interviewers and respondents
need to be analyzed, to determine the extent to which the
competing ideas of whether interviewer effects are
inconsequential or not to data quality are supported based on
mono- or cross-cultural conditions. While analysis of cultural
difference is beyond the scope of this study, a comprehensive
analysis of demographic homo- and heterophily matches is
adequate for studying interviewer effects under mono- and
cross-cultural conditions between interviewer and
respondent. The assumption from our phily analyses, hence,
are that interviewer effects will be regarded as consequential
to data quality if response patterns during homophilous
conditions are significantly different from heterophilous
matches between interviewers and respondents. Conversely,
interviewer effects will be regarded as inconsequential to data
quality if patterns of interviewer response are similar in both
homo- and heterophilous conditions.
Method
Independent Variable
To assess differences in interview response by race, gender,
and race-gender of respondents vis-à-vis race, gender, and
race-gender of interviewers, this study generated 24 phily
matches (8 homophilies and 16 heterophilies) between
respondents and interviewers as independent variables (see
Table 1). All 24 phily matches, as independent variables,
were used to conduct a comprehensive analysis of interview
response inconsistencies, of Black and White, and men and
women respondents, vis-à-vis Black and White, and men
and women interviewers on response patterns to two
selected dependent variables.
Dependent Variables
The influences of race, gender, and race-gender phily
matches were tested on two separate dependent variables;
support for affirmative action (AA) practice, and support
for America's Affordable Health Choices Act (AHC) of
2009. These two government policies were selected as
dependent variables because they readily generate public
opinion, and they allowed us the opportunity to analyze
phily effects on one policy which explicitly made
provisions for race and gender in its letters (AA), and one
that neither explicitly nor implicitly made references to race
and gender (AHC). This will help to affirm or deny the
commonality of race and gender effects on both race and
gender sensitive and neutral topics.
Support for AA
The selection of support for AA practice as a dependent
variable was based on literature that affirmed the language
of AA as explicitly race and gender specific (U.S.
Commission on Civil Rights, 1981) and literature that has
concluded that race of interviewer significantly shaped
interviewees' responses on race-sensitive items (Alderfer &
Tucker, 1996; D. W. Davis, 1997a, 1997b). Support for AA
has also been established to be racially sensitive and gender
patterned. Minorities, especially Blacks, for example, are
more likely to support AA than non-Hispanic Whites, and
women are more likely to favor the policy than men
(Konrad & Spitz, 2003; Oyinlade, 2013; Park, 2009; Smith,
1998). It was, therefore, anticipated in this study that
interview response to this variable would be shaped by race
and gender phily matching of both interviewer and
interviewee. The measurement of this variable (support for
AA) is explained under "measures."

Support for AHC of 2009: H.R. 3200
Since first introduced by the Obama Administration (later
amended as H.R. 3962-Affordable Health Care for America
Act, and signed into law as H.R. 3590: Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act; Congress.Gov, 2009), AHC has
been heavily debated in the U.S. Congress and the
American popular media. The Act was written to make
health care affordable for all Americans, and its text was
race and gender neutral (Congress.Gov, 2009). The central
theme in the debate on AHC, arguably, has been racial and
gender neutral, but mainly political (Democrats vs.
Republicans; Liberals vs. Conservatives, etc.). Because of
its popularity in the media, and the political tones (rather
than racial or gendered) of the debates, we anticipated that
respondents would have opinions on the bill, and their
opinions might be racially and gender neutral. This
assumption was not borne out of naivety for the general
potential influences of race and gender on social issues in
the United States. We are well aware that the
characterization of AHC as "Obamacare" may be laden
with negative racial undertones, but the policy, however,
provided us an opportunity for phily comparisons with AA
policy, a much more confirmed racially and gender
sensitive social policy. The following research question was
answered to meet the objective of this study:
Research Question: How were the levels of support for
AA and AHC different by race, gender, and race-gender
philies? That is, how were the levels of support for AA
and AHC different by race, gender, and race-gender of
respondents, vis-à-vis race, gender, and race-gender of
interviewers?
Answers to this question would show patterns of change
(i.e., inconsistencies) in respondents' answers to interview
questions on both AA and AHC by race, gender, and race-
gender of respondents relative to race, gender, and race-
gender of interviewers.
Measures
A separate scale was constructed to measure support for AA
and support for AHC. AA describes any measure, beyond
simple termination of a discriminatory practice, adopted to
correct or compensate for past or present discrimination, or
to prevent discrimination from recurring in the future
(Office of Federal Contracts Compliance Programs
[OFCCP], 2002; U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 1977).
Items used to measure support for AA in this study (see
Table 2), were adapted from Parra (1991). We defined AHC
as a program intended to ensure that every American had an
affordable health care insurance through an employer or
through government. We were unable to secure any existing
scale that measured support for AHC, so we constructed
one based on general knowledge of the bill, as commonly
expressed in popular media. We used general media
knowledge about the bill because we assumed that most
people in the public would not have read the actual scripts
of the bill, and that they would have formed opinions on the
bill mainly based on information (accurate or not) obtained
from the media. We justified this approach to scale
construction because we deemed it sufficient for the
objective of this study, which was the measurement of
change in answers to interview questions based on race and
gender phily matches.
Each scale was summated rating Likert-type, and
contained seven fully structured, closed-ended items, with
response options ranging from 6 (strongly agree) to 1
(strongly disagree). Higher values indicated greater support
for each variable. Closed ended questions were used so as
to generate data with quantitative properties for statistical
analysis.
Reliability statistics yielded Cronbach's alpha = .923 for
the scale of support for AA and .942 for the scale of support
for health care reform (see Table 2). Factor analysis, using
principal component extraction method, showed a strong
internal consistency under one component for the items on

each scale. Factor loading coefficients for all AA items
ranged from .690 to .884, and they ranged from .686 to .902
for all items of AHC (see Table 2 for complete information
on each scale). Other items on the questionnaire were
nominal questions on the race (Black or White) and gender
(man or woman) of both the interviewer and respondents.
Data
Twenty-nine university students (Whites = 62% [n = 18],
Blacks = 38% [n = 11], men = 55% [n = 16], women = 45%
[n = 13], White men = 34% [n = 10], White women = 28 %
[n = 8], Black men = 21% [n = 6], Black women = 17 % [n
= 5]) served as survey interviewers for this research. To
enhance the consistence in their performance, all the
interviewers were assembled and trained in interviewing
data collection. The training included guidelines for
politeness when requesting someone to be interviewed, and
readily granting right of non-participation to anyone not
willing to participate in the study. Interviewers were also
instructed to promise anonymity to all willing participants.
During each interview, the interviewers were instructed to
only read interview questions verbatim as structured on the
questionnaire, and to record respondents' answers exactly
as stated by respondents, and in conformity with the closed-
ended response format of each question. Interviewers were
instructed not to explain, interpret, or discuss any
questionnaire item to research participants. Interviewers
could only repeat (reread) questions, if research participants
wanted further information on a questionnaire item.
Interview sites were public places with high foot traffic in
the city of Omaha, Nebraska. These locations were the four
major city malls as well as strip malls, big department and
drug stores such as Wal-Mart, Target, Shopko, and
Walgreens. The malls and stores spanned across all regions
(North, South, East, and West) in the city, and they drew
patrons from all areas of the city. The patrons of these
locations were solicited by our trained interviewers for
voluntary participation in this study. The interviewers went in
self-selected teams of three or four people to each location to
provide support for one another as might be necessary. We
also anticipated that the mere presence of other interviewers
6 SAGE Open
(i.e., team members) at a location, at the same time, would
encourage each interviewer to perform as instructed during
training. Each team conducted interviews in, at least, two
time periods (morning, afternoon or evening) in, at least, two
different sites, during an 8-week period in fall 2010.
Consistent with the objective of this study, all 29
interviewers were either Black or White, and they were
instructed to interview only Black and White voluntary
participants. Of 580 questionnaires distributed to the 29
interviewers, a total of 522 questionnaires (90%) were
completed. Thirty-one completed questionnaires of
respondents who identified themselves as neither Black, nor
White were discarded for not being the target population for
this study. This left a useful return rate of 85% (491
questionnaires). Of the 491 useful interviews, 69% (n =
338) were completed by White interviewers, while Black
interviewers completed 31% (n = 153) of the interviews.
Men and women interviewers completed 63% (n = 310) and
37% (n = 181), respectively, of the interviews. Counting by
race-gender, White men, White women, Black men and
Black women interviewers completed 43% (n = 209), 26%
(n = 129), 21% (n = 101), and 11% (n = 52), respectively,
of useful interviews. The participants were mainly White
(68%, n = 329) and men (54%, n = 261). White men
constituted 35% of all respondents, whereas White women,
Black men, and Black women constituted 34%, 19%, and
13%, respectively, of all 491 respondents.
Tests and Findings
ANOVA coefficients with the Bonferroni/Dun post hoc
comparisons, at alpha = .05, were used to measure
significant differences in support levels for AA and AHC
under various phily matches of race, gender, and race-
gender of respondents and interviewers. ANOVA
comparisons indicated specific conditions (phily matches)
under which interview responses changed for any specific
respondent category, and post hoc results showed the extent
of significant change in interview responses between any
two categories of respondents vis-à-vis their respective
categories of interviewers. Findings for each test are
reported under each phily area as follows:
Race Phily
Interview response differences under four possible race-
phily conditions (two homophilies and two heterophilies)
were analyzed (Table 3). ANOVA coefficient showed that
the Black homophily (Black respondent/Black interviewer)
produced the highest levels of support for both AA (b =
3.891) and AHC (b = 3.837), but when interviewed by
Whites (race heterophily), Black respondents lowered their
support for both dependent variables (AA, b = 3.191; AHC,
b = 2.484). Unlike Blacks, White respondents demonstrated
negative support for both dependent variables, especially in
the White homophily (White respondent/White interviewer)
condition (AA, b = 4.443; AHC, b = 3.193). When
interviewed by Blacks (race heterophily), however, Whites
were less negative in their support for both dependent
variables (AA, b = 2.640; AHC, b 3.128).
The Bonferroni/Dun post hoc race-phily analyses ( =
.0083 for  = .05) showed that the strongest significant
difference in support for AA and AHC was the homophily
comparison. The comparison revealed that White
homophily supported the two dependent variables
significantly lesser than the Black homophily (M difference
= 8 points for AA and 7 points for AHC). Except for the
White homophily versus White-respondent/Black-
interviewer heterophily and the Black-respondent/White-
interviewer heterophily versus Black homophily
comparisons that were not significantly different in their
support for both dependent variables, all other race-phily
comparisons showed significant differences in support of
both AA and AHC (see Table 4 for full result).
Gender Phily
Like race-phily analyses, four possible gender phily conditions
(two homophilies and two heterophilies) were also analyzed
for shifts in support levels for both AA and AHC (Table 3).
ANOVA coefficient showed that gender phily was a
significant factor of support for both AA (b = 2.817) and AHC
(b = 2.099) only when women were interviewed by men
(gender heterophily). All other gender philies did not produce
significant shifts in support for both dependent variables.
The Bonferroni/Dun post hoc gender phily analyses ( =
.0083 for  = .05) showed that the largest significant difference
in support for both AA and AHC was in the women-
respondent/men-interviewer versus men-respondent/women-
interviewer heterophily comparison. The former phily
outscored the latter by 6.1 points for AA and 4.7 points for
AHC. Results also showed that the men homophily gave
greater support for AA and AHC (M difference = 3.65 and 3.81,
respectively) than the men who were interviewed by women
(men respondent/women interviewer heterophily comparisons).
See Table 4 for result details on post hoc gender comparisons.
Race-Gender Phily
Interview response patterns under all possible matches (4
homophily and 12 heterophily) were analyzed for race-gender
differences in support for both dependent variables (Table 5).
ANOVA coefficients showed that White men displayed
negative attitude toward both programs, regardless of the race-
gender of their interviewers. Statistically significant results
indicated that White men were most negative about both AA
and AHC when interviewed by White women (AA, b = 
8.161; AHC, b = 6.462), but they (White men) lessened their
negative toward AA in the White men homophily (b = 5.808)
and toward AHC when interviewed by Black men (b = 
4.305). In all other results involving White men as
respondents, the shifts in their support for both dependent
variables were not statistically significant.

Like White men, White women as respondents also
demonstrated a pattern of negative attitude toward both
government programs, regardless of the race-gender of their
interviewers. The only significantly different response to
both dependent variables, however, was the White women
homophily (AA, b = 2.632; AHC, b = 2.676). Also, the
answers given by White women to Black women
interviewers on support for AA approached statistical
significance (b = 3.827, p = .054). All other phily matches
involving White women as respondents did not produce
statistically significant shifts in their support for both
programs.
Results for Black men as respondents showed that Black
men, as a pattern, responded positively toward both
dependent variables. ANOVA coefficients revealed that
Black men most positively supported both AA and AHC
when interviewed by White men (AA, b = 4.731; AHC, b =
5.605), but they (Black men) slightly lowered their support
for both dependent variables in the Black men homophily
(AA, b = 4.254; AHC, b = 3.679). Results also showed that
when interviewed by White women, Black men displayed
significant negative support for AHC (b = 3.976).
Like Black men, Black women were predominantly
positive in their response to both dependent variables. For
both AA and AHC, Black women were most significantly
positive when interviewed by Black men (AA, b = 9.587;
AHC, b = 8.924), followed by a lowered, but positive
support, when interviewed by White men (AA, b = 6.695;
AHC, b = 6.117). All other phily matches involving Black
women as respondents failed to show significant shifts in
response to both dependent variables by Black women.
The Bonferroni/Dun post hoc analysis ( = .0004 for  =
.05) calculated 120 possible separate post hoc race-gender
phily comparisons for each dependent variable. Of the 120
phily comparisons for each dependent variable,
approximately 23% (n = 27) and 15% (n = 18) of phily
comparisons for AA and AHC, respectively, indicated
significant differences in interview response. All phily
comparisons that indicated significant differences in support
for both dependent variables are displayed in Table 6.

aHomophily comparisons, resp = respondent, inter = interviewer.
Post hoc comparison showed that White men
interviewed by White women were least likely to support
both dependent variables when compared with Black
women interviewed by Black men (17.7 points lesser in
support of AA, and 15.4 points lesser in support of AHC).
The least difference in phily comparisons for White men
respondents for AA showed that the White men homophily
was 8.1 points lesser in support for AA than the Black
women homophily. For support of AHC, the least
comparison difference involving White men showed that
White men homophily was 7.7 points lesser than Black men
interviewed by White men.
Like White men, all race-gender phily comparisons
involving White women as respondents showed White
women supporting both AA and AHC lesser than Black men
and Black women as respondents. Post hoc comparisons
showed that White women were least likely to support AA
when the White women homophily was compared with
Black women interviewed by Black men (12.2 points lesser
for White women than Black women respondents). White
women were also least likely to support AHC when White
women interviewed by Black men were compared with
Black women interviewed by Black men (13.2 points
differential). The closest gap in comparison of any two phily
matches in support of both AA and AHC occurred when
White women interviewed by White men were compared
with Black men interviewed by White men (AA = 6.2 points
differential, AHC = 7.3 points differential).
Race-gender post hoc comparisons involving Black men
showed that Black men interviewed by White men,
supported AA by 12.89 points more than White men
interviewed by White women. When interviewed by White
women, however, Black men supported AA and AHC by
12.4 points and 12.9 points, respectively, which was lesser
than Black women interviewed by Black men. The closest
gap in support for both AA and AHC among all significant
phily comparisons involving Black men as respondents
occurred when Black men interviewed by White men,
supported AA by 7.0 points more than White men
interviewed by Black men. For support of AHC, Black men
interviewed by White men scored 8.28 points more than the
White women homophily.

aHomophilies.
The pattern of post hoc interview response analyses
involving Black women showed that Black women
interviewed by White men scored 14.85 points and 12.57
points higher support for AA and AHC, respectively, than
White men interviewed by White women. Black women
interviewed by Black men also displayed 13.4 points
greater support for AA than White women interviewed by
Black women. The closest gap between any two phily
comparisons for AA was the 8.58 points higher support for
AA by Black women interviewed by White men over White
women interviewed by Black men. Similarly, the closest
gap in phily comparisons was the 8.79 points higher support
for AHC by Black women interviewed by White men over
the White women homophily. See details of all differences
in interview responses to both AA and AHC by race-gender
phily post hoc comparisons in Table 6.
Conclusion
This study comprehensively analyzed, beyond the
parameters covered by previous studies on the topic, the
likelihood that interviewer effects will be consequential (or
not) to data quality based on homo- and heterophily
interview conditions between interviewers and respondents.
By using ANOVA tests, in this study, we sought to examine

the extent to which interview responses would differ by
race, gender, and race-gender of interviewers and the phily
conditions under which such differences would occur to
determine consequentiality of race, gender, and race-gender
effects on data quality.
ANOVA comparisons were preferred for analysis over
ordinary least squares (OLS), particularly, hierarchical
regression used in similar studies (e.g., Gong & Aadland,
2011) because of the challenges posed by the number of
comparisons necessitated in this study. For one, because of
the comprehensiveness of race, gender, and race-gender
variables in 24 different phily conditions we analyzed for
response differences, the nature of the group differences in
our analyses amounted to a 2  2  2  2 design with a four-
way interaction. Interpreting four-way interactions are
notoriously complicated, which often pose additional
challenges in the presentation of findings for clarity. Also,
the 2  2  2  2 design complicates the creation of
interaction terms in OLS regression because the z scores
amount to 1 and 1, and multiplying these (using coded
contrasts) provides little clarity. Even with a concerted
attempt to analyze the data using multilevel modeling by
nesting the respondents into individual groups, the problem
of limited number of degrees of freedom hindered such
analysis in OLS, and hence, making the 2  2  2  2
ANOVA the best analysis for our data and research
questions. Another hindrance to multilevel nesting of
interviewees in interviewers is that our data were not
recorded to allow linking particular set of interviews with
particular interviewers due to over conformity to
confidentiality and anonymity rights of both interviewers
and respondents. The data collection method was however,
deliberate because the objective of this study was to test for
mean differences in interview response by phily matches.
Our research objective, therefore, justifies our choice of
data collection process and analysis.
Our findings across all phily comparisons indicated a
general pattern of nonrandom (i.e., structured) interview
response, hence, confirming consequentiality of interviewer
effects on data quality. Our findings demonstrated a pattern
of race, gender, and race-gender of interviewer effects based
on patterns homo- and heterophilous matches between
Oyinlade and Losen 11
interviewer and respondents. For example, the White
homophily showed a higher negative value for both AA and
AHC than the White respondent/Black interviewer
heterophily (see Table 3). Similarly, the Black homophily
showed a higher support for both dependent variables than
the Black respondent/White interviewer heterophily. Post hoc
comparisons also confirmed that the largest difference in
support for both dependent variables was between the White
homophily and the Black homophily, and other differences in
phily comparisons became smaller as the comparisons
became more heterophilous. These findings support earlier
findings that respondents tended to acquiesce to the race of
interviewer (D. W. Davis, 1997a, 1997b; Ellison et al., 2011;
Krysan & Couper, 2003), and Whites tended to be more
liberal and politically correct (R. E. Davis et al., 2010; Finkel,
Guterbock, & Borg, 1991; Gong & Aadland, 2011; Krysan &
Couper, 2003), as well as reluctant to oppose racially
centered policy when interviewed by Blacks (Krysan &
Couper, 2003). Our finding that gender difference in support
for both dependent variables was significant only when
women were interviewed by men (Tables 3 and 4), indicated
that men had significant effects on how women answered
questions, but not vice versa.
Our race-gender phily analyses specified particular
patterns of race-gender influences of both respondents and
interviewers on interview responses. We found that White
men gave significantly different answers (higher negative
response) to AA when interviewed by White women and
fellow White men, but no significant difference was found
when White men were interviewed by Black men and Black
women. White men also gave significantly different
answers to AHC when interviewed by White women
(higher negative response) and Black men (tempered
negative response) but gave no significantly different
responses when interviewed by White men and Black
women. White women gave significantly different
(negative) answers to AA and AHC only to White women
interviewers, but they gave no significantly different
responses to other race-gender categories of interviewers.
Results also revealed that Black men gave significantly
different answers (positive response) to Black men and
White men interviewers but gave no significantly different
responses to White women and Black women interviewers
on support for AA. For AHC, Black men gave significantly
different answers (positive response) to Black men, White
men and White women (negative response) interviewers but
gave no significantly different response to Black women
interviewers. Last, Black women gave significantly
different (positive) answers to both dependent variables
only when interviewed by White men and Black men.
This study made some important contributions to existing
literature on the effects of extraneous variables on data
quality. Unlike previous studies that focused mainly on
interviewer effects, this study paid attention to both
interviewer and respondent's characteristics. Also, unlike
most previous studies that focused only on one interviewer
effect characteristic (e.g., race only, gender only, etc.) this
study was based on multiple characteristics (race [Black and
White], gender, and race-gender) of both respondents and
interviewers within the context of a single study. This study,
therefore, gives a more comprehensive analyses of race,
gender, and race-gender effects on data quality in one single
study than found in many (if not any) studies on the same
topic. Our analysis of race-gender effects (which were mostly
absent in previous studies) are especially important because
every individual is a combination of both race and gender,
and neither is separable from the other in real-life
interactions. In addition, post hoc values showed specific
differences in interview response between any two phily
categories, thereby providing knowledge on specific
directions and magnitude of response difference in interview
response based on phily matches. We add that this study also
provide empirical confirmation to speculations in popular
media that support for the America's Health Choices Act of
2009 was race sensitive, even though the language of the bill
was race neutral, unlike the AA policy.
Overall, this study reaffirms the significance of the need
to pay attention to race, gender, and race-gender effects on
data quality during data collection. Both data quality and
research integrity are at stake to the extent that race and
gender of respondents and interviewers influence data
quality when research participants conform their answers to
accommodate the interviewer, thereby exaggerating or
tempering the relationships between variables (D. W.
Davis, 1997b; Sherman, 2002). Given that findings of social
science research carry significant implications for practice
and generalizations about society, it is important for data
collectors to devise methods to assess and nullify race and
gender effects in their data and analyses.
Limitations
We recognize the following limitations to the findings of
this study:
1. There was an imbalance in the racial and gender
compositions of the survey interviewers, and a much
larger imbalance in the racial and gender compositions
of the respondents by each interviewer category. There
were fewer Black respondents than White respondents,
and the average numbers of cross-race interviews per
person were much smaller than for same-race
interviews for White interviewers. Black interviewers
had a much higher per capita cross-race interviews
(though collectively they completed much lesser
amount of interviews) than White interviewers. Black
women interviewers and Black women respondents
were also much fewer than other race-gender
combinations of interviewers and respondents. The
reasons (beyond the scope of this study) for the
imbalance in cross-race interviews were unclear, but
we suspected that the imbalance might have potentially
12 SAGE Open
been a function of lingering uncomfortable race
relations sentiments in the city. Because of traditional
tension and discomfort in cross-race relations in the
city (and the United States in general), White
interviewers in this study might have been less inclined
to readily approach Blacks for interview; hence, they
(White interviewers) turned inwardly and interviewed
more Whites. For Back interviewers, it might have
been a bit easier for them to solicit Whites for
interviews because they have always lived in a world
dominated by Whites, and might have therefore,
developed a greater level of comfort than Whites in
engaging in cross-racial activities. Another explanation
for the imbalance in cross-race interviews might be that
because the interview was conducted in Omaha,
Nebraska, a predominantly White city, Blacks would
have more opportunities to interview Whites (because
of the much larger White population) than vice versa.
This means that the imbalance in cross-race interview
could have been more of a function of structural factors
of population distribution than tensions of race
relations.
2. It was mentioned in literature review that some studies
had linked variables like age and education to
differences in interview response. The focus in this
study was strictly on race and gender phily analyses
beyond the scope of any previous study, hence, we
did not control for the potential influences of other
possible variables. While the omission of other
variables in our analyses might be a source of
limitation to our results, it conversely helped to make
our analyses streamlined, manageable, and focused on
our research objective.
3. Multilevel nesting of interviewees in interviewers
would have been ideal for data analyses had data been
collected in such a way to permit such analyses.
Nesting requires linking a particular interviewer to a
particular set of interviewees. An overly strict
adherence to the privacy and anonymity rights of both
interviewers and interviewees prevented necessary
identification of particular set of interviews with
particular interviewer to enable nesting. Data were,
however, collected consistently with the objective of
testing mean differences in interview response by
phily matches using ANOVA.
4. The Bonferroni correction, though necessary because
of multiple post hoc tests to reduce the likelihood that
any set of group comparisons would produce a Type I
error, is overly strict and might have hidden some
potential significant group differences in our post hoc
comparisons.
