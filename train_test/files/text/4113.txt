ABSTRACT
To investigate the possibility of the involvement of an oxidative stress induction
in the mechanism of the cytotoxic effect of quinolone antibiotics, we examined the
viability of human fibroblast cells exposed to ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and measured
the levels of lipid peroxidation (LP), glutathione (GSH), and the activities of the
antioxidant enzymes catalase (GAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione
peroxidase (GPX). The data showed that the effect of CPFX on the viability of
cells, as determined by neutral red uptake assay, was time-dependent, and the dose-
response relation was biphasic. Cytotoxicity was not observed in the concentration
range 5-150 mg/l CPFX when the cells were incubated for 24 h. In contrast, lower
concentrations (5 and 12.5 mg/l) of CPFX increased the cell growth in all incuba-
tion periods tested. Marked decreases in the viability of fibroblasts were observed
at concentrations 50 and 75 mg/l, and :::50 mg/l, following 48 and 72 h exposure,
respectively (P < 0.05), However, when the cells were exposed to > 75 mg/l CPFX
for 48 h, no cytotoxicity was observed. By exposing fibroblast cultures to 75 mg/l
CPFX for 48 h, an induction of LP enhancement and a marked decrease in in-
tracellular GSH were observed, Vitamin E pretreaunent of the cells lowered the
level of LP, increased the total GSII content, and provided significant protection
against CPFX-induced cytotoxicity, The biphasic effect of CPFX possibly resulted
from the complex dose-dependent rel.uion-drips be-tween reactive oxygen species
(ROS), cell proliferation, and cc-Ilviabilitv. It \\'as previously reported, in fact, for

INTRODUCTION
Hormesis is described as characterizing the dose-response continuum as stimula-
tory at low doses and inhibitory at high doses, and leading to the biphasic, hormetic
dose-response curve (Calabrese and Baldwin, 2001). Our recent studies on fluoro-
quinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CPFX) in human fibroblast cell cultures resulted
in a biphasic response that appeared to be a good example for the hormesis concept
(Gurbay et al., 2002).
Our interest in CPFX was started with a point of view that its adverse effects,
particularly phototoxicity and epileptogenic seizures, might be related to an oxida-
tive stress induction. Considering the occurrence of oxidative radical reactions (at a
continuous rate and usually in association with cellular electron transfer chains and
certain enzyme activities), the concept of the existence of a physiological steady-
state level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mammalian tissues is well accepted
(Boveris and Cadenas, 1997). The consequences of xenobiotically induced distur-
bances in that delicate balance are of great importance. Therefore, we investigated
earlier the possibility of oxidative stress induction by CPFX in vivo and observed
significant enhancement of lipid peroxidation (LP) and alteration of glutathione
redox status (GSSG%) in cerebral and hepatic tissues of rats (Hincal and Taskin,
1995). Furthermore, vitamin E or allopurinol pretreatment was found to be signif-
icantly protective. Several investigators also reported that the phototoxic effects of
quinolones were related to the generation of ROS, particularly singlet oxygen and
superoxide anion, in the presence of lJVA irradiation in vivo and in vitro (Wagai
and Tawara, 1991, I992a, I992b; Umezawa et al., 1997).
In the present study, our aim was to elucidate the involvement of oxidative stress
and LP induction in the mechanism of action of CPFX in mammalian cells in the
absence of lJVA irradiation.

Biphasic Response of Ciprofloxacin
Cell Culture
Primary cell lines of fibroblasts were prepared after skin biopsy from voluntary
healthy adults aged 20-40 years. Dilacerated skin samples were incubated in calf-
serum-rich culture medium [RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% FCS,
L-glutamine (1.8 mM), penicillin (180 Uz'rnl}, streptomycin (180 mg/l), kanamycin
(56 mg/l), and fungizone (0.9 mg/l)] at 37°C, in a humid atmosphere containing
5% CO2
and 95% air (Forma, Scientific incubator) in 75 cm 2 plastic culture flasks
(Nunc, Denmark) by the method of Hom (1976). The cells were re-fed two times a
week with fresh medium, split every seventh day, and the cells of5 and 10 subcultures
were used for the experiments.
Cytotoxicity Assay
Before exposure to CPFX, the cells were incubated for 24 h to allow adherence and
initiation of proliferation. CPFX was then added to the medium in eight different
doses to achieve final concentrations ranging from 5 to 150 mg/l, and the cells were
incubated for 24, 48, or 72 h. Each concentration of drug was tested in triplicate.
All CPFX solutions were freshly prepared and protected from light (covered by
aluminum foil). During all treatment procedures, all culture flasks and petri dishes
were protected in the same way.
Neutral red (NR) uptake assay for the determination of potential cytotoxicity
of CPFX was performed by the method of Borenfreund and Puerner (1985). The
accumulation of i\R in lysosornes of viable cells was determined after an extraction
process. The absorbance value of samples was read at 540 nrn and was corrected by
subtracting the mean absorbance value of cell-free controls. Results were expressed
as the percent value (percent survival) of the mean absorbance of drug-free control
cells.
To examine the protective effect of ,itamin E, the cells were preincnbated with
50 Il~ vitamin E for 4 hand then exposed to 75 mg/l CPFX [or 48 h. The viability
of the cells was evaluated by the NR uptake assay as described.
Determination of LP, Total GSH Level, and Antioxidant Enzyme Activities
After incubation with 75 mg/l CPFX for 48 h, with or without !'i0 liM vitamin E
pretreatment, the cells were trvpsinized, resuspended in fresh mer [ia, and pelleted by
centrifugation. Pellet was washed three times with isotonic Tris-HCl (O.2mM, pH 7.4)
buffer, then resuspended in hypotonic Tris-l l'Cl buffer, pH 7.3, and grounded in a
potter homogenizer at SOgfor 5 min. The lvsaie was used for the determination ofLP,
the total intracellular glulathiouf' (GSII) content, and the activities of antioxidant
enzymes.
LP was measured fluorometically as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances
(TBARS) using a Perkin-Elmer model LS 50 fluorometer by the method of Richard
et at. (1992).
For the measurement of the total GSH: content, the lysate was diluted with
metaphosphoric acid (6%) [(lysate: metaphosphoric acid (5:1, v/v)], centrifuged at
Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.4, 2003 483
F. HincaI et al,
1500g, 4°C, for 10 min, and supernatant was used for the total GSH determination
by the method ofAkerboom and Sies (1981) as we described earlier (Emonet et al.,
1997).
After further centrifugation of the cell lysate at 1500g, 4°C, for 10 min, superoxide
dismutases (SODs), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and catalase (CAT) activities
were determined in the supernatant. The activities of total SOD, Mn SOD, and
CuZn SOD were assessed by monitoring auto-oxidation of pyrogallol according to a
procedure adapted to the cells (Parat et al., 1998). The GPX activity was assessed by
using the method of Gunzler et at. (1974). The CAT activity was quantitated using
the method of Aebi (1984) by following the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide
(H2
0 2 ) at 240 nm.
All results were expressed as values normalized to the cell protein content, and
protein concentrations in the homogenate (total protein) were determined by the
procedure described by Shopsis and Mackay (1984) or in the supernatant (soluble
protein) according to the method of Lowry et at. (1951).
Statistics
The two-tailed Mann-Whithney Ustest was employed to calculate statistical signif-
icance between control and treated groups.
RESULTS
Effect of CPFX on the Survival of Normal Human Fibroblast Cells
The effect of CPFX on the viability of normal human fibroblast cells, as deter-
mined by the NR assay, is illustrated in Figure 1. The data show that the effect of
CPFX on the viability ofcells was time-dependent, and the dose-response relation was
biphasic. Cytotoxicity was not observed in the concentration range of 5-150 mg/l
CPFX when the cells were incubated for 24 h. In contrast, lower concentrations (5
and 12.5 mg/l) of CPFX increased the cell survival in all incubation periods tested.
Marked decreases in the viability of fibroblasts were observed at concentrations of
50 and 75 mg/l, and ~50 mg/l, following 48 and 72 h exposure, respectively (p <
0.05). When the cells were exposed to > 75 mg/l CPFX for 48 h, no cytotoxicity was
observed. However, at the same concentration range following the 72 h incubation
period, viability of the cells decreased compared to controls and 48 h.
Effect of Vitamin E on the Cytotoxic Effect of CPFX
As illustrated in Figure 2, when vitamin E-pretreated fibroblasts were exposed
to 75 mg/l CPFX for 48 h, the cell survival significantly increased compared to
CPFX-treated cells (p< 0.001).
Effects of CPFX and CPFX Plus Vitamin E on LP, Total GSH Level,
and Antioxidant Enzyme Activities
By exposing fibroblast cultures to 75 mg/l CPFX for 48 h, an induction of LP
enhancement and a marked decrease in intracellular GSH were observed (Fig. 3).

significantly increased the total GSH content, it was not able to maintain the same
level in the presence of CPFX and provided only a moderate increase compared to
the cells exposed to CPFX alone.

DISCUSSION
Quinolones are potent antimicrobials with a broad spectrum of activity and
are effective against a wide range of infections caused by gram-positive and gram-
negative bacteria, including Bacillusanthracis(Wolfson and Hooper, 1985; Blondeau,
1999). They exert their bactericidal effect by inhibiting the bacterial DNA gyrase,
a type II topoisomerase (Gellert, 1981; Gootz et al., 1990). However, the influence
of quinolones on mammalian DNA topoisomerases is several orders of magnitude
weaker than prokaryotic topoisomerase II (Wolfson and Hooper, 1985; Hussy et al.,
1986). They have the advantage of possessing a relatively good phannacokinetic
profile and bioavailability, and ease of oral dosing (Blondeau, 1999). In addition,
compared to other commonly used antimicrobial agents, quinolones are considered
relatively well tolerated. However, clinical experience has indicated that they have
some undesirable adverse effects including cutaneous reactions like phototoxicity,
juvenile cartilage toxicity, and, although the incidence is very low, adverse central
nervous system reactions including epileptogenic convulsions (Wolfson and Hooper,
1985; Grayson, 1999; Stahlman and Lode, 1999). The mechanism underlying these
adverse effects is still unknown. On the other hand, the capacity of quinolones to
inhibit cell growth and cell functions in various cell lines in vitro was well docu-
mented (Forsgren et al., 1987; Oomori et al., 1988; Nordmann etal., 1989; Lawrence
et al., 1993, 1996). Inhibition of the cell cycle and cell size progression in mitogen-
stimulated human lymphocytes was reported (Forsgren et al., 1987), and CPFX was
shown to have cytotoxic effects on both murine and human carcinoma cells in vitro
(Zehavi-Willner and Shalit, 1992). Interfering denovopyrimidine synthesis (Forsgren
et al., 1987) or mitochondrial enzymes involved in energy metabolism (Lawrence et
al., 1993) were suggested as the underlying mechanisms. However, in none of these
publications was a biphasic dose-response curve reported. Results were presented
to be dose-dependent; thus, with high concentrations of quinolone antibiotics, in-
cluding CPFX, growth of various cultured mammalian cells was inhibited (Hussy
et al., 1986; Forsgren et al., 1987; Oomori et al., 1988; Lawrence et al., 1993, 1996).
Cytotoxicity started at concentrations over 20 mg/l, more often in the range 40-
80 mg/l, and complete growth inhibition was frequently observed at concentrations
over 100 mg/l (Hussy et al., 1986; Nordmann et al., 1989).
In the present study, CPFX inhibited the proliferation of normal human fibrob-
last cells at a similar dose range as previously described. The inhibitory effect was
observed at concentrations of 50 and 75 lUg/I, and ::::50 lUg/I, when cells were in-
cubated for 48 or 72 h, respectively. However, the effect of CPFX on the viability of
cells was time-dependent, and the dose-response relation was biphasic. Low doses
of CPFX appeared to be stimulatory at all incubation periods, whereas cytotoxicity
was not observed in the whole concentration range tested (5-150 mg/l) during the
24 h of incubation. This delayed effect was pointed out earlier by Lawrence et at.
(1996) and was described as a usual feature of the CPFX-induced growth inhibi-
tion. Depending on the type of cells, the lag period was 2-4 days and corresponded
488 Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.4, 2003
Biphasic Response of Ciprofloxacin
approximately to 3-4 cell doublings. They further observed a time-dependent de-
crease in cellular content of mtDNA prior to inhibition of cell proliferation with
CPFX and related the observed cytotoxicity to the disturbances in the mitochon-
dria. Their conclusion was that the inhibition of mammalian cell proliferation by
CPFX is related to selective depletion ofmtDNA through an interference with mito-
chondrial topoisomerase type II-like activity. Although we did not measure mtDNA
damage in this study, this mechanism might also be an explanation for the lag period
we observed.
The biphasic effect observed in the presentstudymay also resultfrom the complex
dose-response relationship among ROS, cell proliferation, and cell viability, ROS are
involved in cellular processes as diverse as proliferation, and cell death (Pervaiz and
Clement,2002). A growing body of evidence suggests that ROS, such as superoxide
anions and hydrogen peroxide, function as intracellular second messengers involved
in cellular signaling and, thus, can influence the growth as well as the death of the
cell (Finkel, 1998; Clement and Pervaiz, 1999). In fact, it is well described by several
cell models, including fibroblasts, that ROS exert a biphasic effect on cell growth
(Murrell et al., 1990; Los et al., 1995; Schafer et al., 1996). As in the case of our
previous study with paraquat on HeLa cells (Seve et al., 1999), lower doses increase
proliferation and higher doses lead to cell death by apoptosis or necrosis (Buttke
and Dandstrom, 1994). In addition, cultured fibroblasts were reported to release
their own free radicals (Murell et al., 1990). Their proliferation was inhibited when
endogenous ROS were inhibited, whereas the effect ofexogenous ROS was biphasic.
The data obtained in the present study also showed the occurrence ofoxidative stress
in fibroblast cell proliferation. Exposure of fibroblast cultures to 75 mg/l CPFX for
48 h induced a significant level of LP and a marked decrease in intracellular GSH.
These observations were further supported by the data obtained with vitamin E
pretreatment of cells and were in good agreement with our previous in vivo results
obtained in CPFX-treated rats (Hine'al and Taskin, 1995).
Considering the aforementioned facts and arguments, the overall interpretation
of the results of the present study might be as follows. If fibroblasts need a certain
level ofROS to proliferate, and if CPFX not only interferes with mtD:\'A replication,
but also introduces ROS into the system, there might be a certain point at which a
sensitive balance is established. Cell doubling time of fibroblasts is 22 h (Baudhuin,
1975), hence, when fibroblasts are exposed to 75 mg/l CPFX for 48 h, two full cell
doublings may occur and Ill(' extent of dilution in the cellular content of mtDNA
might reach a critical point that is not sufficient to sustain the cell growth. However,
the level of ROS induced by higher concentrations (:::100 mg/l) of CPFX might
compensate for the effect of such a level of loss in mtDNA and, hence, the cells
continue to grow. In fact, when exposure time was increased to 72 h, the cell viability
and growth was affected starting with doses over 25 mg/l and continued to decrease
in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, more than one biochemical effect, such as
oxygen radicals, and mitochondrial loss might be responsive at different doses for
the cytotoxicity of CPFX, and the juxtaposition of these mechanisms might result in
Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.4, 2003 489

the biphasic aspect of the survival curves. Nevertheless, further studies combining
mtDNA and ROS measurements at different time points and concentrations are
needed for making a precise conclusion.
Free radical production due to exogenous chemicals occurs either during the di-
rect redox cycling of the compound or metabolization by cytochrome P450. For
CPFX, it is possible that the generation of ROS may occur during its oxidative
metabolism (Sorgel, 1989). In fact, in our recent study performed with hepatic rat
microsomes, we observed the induction of free radical production by CPFX, which
was inhibited completely by a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, SKF525A (Giirbay et al.,
2001).
The results we obtained for antioxidant enzymes were not conclusive, and it ap-
pears that the effect of CPFX at this dose level and time period was not enough to
produce any significant changes in the antioxidant enzyme activities.
In conclusion, CPFX exerted a hormetic-like dose-response in normal human
fibroblast cell cultures. The biphasic effect of CPFX possibly resulted from the com-
plex dose-dependent relationships among ROS, cell proliferation, and cell viability,
as well as a selective depletion ofmtDNA through an interference with mitochondrial
topoisomerase type II-like activity.
