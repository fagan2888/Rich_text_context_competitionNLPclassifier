CIGARETTE SMOKING CAUSES
more preventable deaths from
cardiovascular disease and
cancer than any other modi-
fiable risk factor.1-3 Smokers who quit re-
duce their risk of these conditions and
prolong their lives substantially,4 but
approximately 48 million US adults con-
tinue to smoke.5 Many smokers may dis-
count the increased personal risk they
face from continued smoking,2 thereby
demonstrating an "optimistic bias."6 Phy-
sicians' advice may help smokers assess
their personal health risks more realis-
tically, but many smokers have not
received such advice.7,8 Improving smok-
ers' awareness of their personal health
risks may be useful to promote smok-
ing cessation,9-11 so we analyzed smok-
ers' perceptions of their relative risk of
experiencing a myocardial infarction (MI)
and cancer in a nationally representa-
tive survey.12
METHODS
Data Collection
Following approval of the study proto-
col by the Human Studies Committee of
Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass,
interviewers from a professional survey
firm dialed an equal probability sample
of telephone numbers in the United
States during 1995 to identify residen-
tial households. Within each house-
hold, 1 English-speaking respondent was
selected to achieve prespecified sam-
pling targets defined by sex and 10-
year age intervals from 25 to 74 years.
Eligible respondents were offered a sti-
pend to complete a telephone interview
and a subsequent written question-
naire, both of which provided data for
this study. Interviews were completed by
3487 eligible individuals (response rate,
70%), with no evidence of response bias,
using 1990 US Census data for each tele-
phone exchange. The written question-
naire was completed by 3031 respon-
dents (87%), yielding an overall response
rate of 61%.
Participants were asked if they smoked
cigarettes regularly and the maximum
daily number of cigarettes they had ever
smoked.IndividualswithnohistoryofMI
(n = 2917, 96.2% of sample) or cancer
(n = 2815, 92.9% of sample) were asked,
"Do you think your risk of a heart attack
(or cancer) is higher, lower, or about the
same as other (men/women) your age?"13
Data Analysis
We weighted the data to adjust for prob-
abilities of reaching households within
each telephone exchange, sampling sub-
jects within each household, and obtain-
ing completed telephone interviews and
questionnaires from designated sub-
jects.14 We also used the Current Popu-

Context Cigarette smoking causes more preventable deaths from cardiovascular dis-
ease and cancer than any other modifiable risk factor, but smokers may discount the
increased personal risk they face from continued smoking.
Objective To assess smokers' perceptions of their risks of heart disease and cancer.
Design and Setting Telephone and self-administered survey in 1995 of a prob-
ability sample of US households with telephones.
Participants A total of 3031 adults aged 25 to 74 years, including 737 current smok-
ers (24.3%).
Main Outcome Measures Respondents with no history of myocardial infarction
(MI) (96.2%) or cancer (92.9%) assessed their risk of these conditions relative to other
people of the same age and sex. Among current smokers, perceived risks were ana-
lyzed by demographic and clinical factors using logistic regression.
Results Only 29% and 40% of current smokers believed they have a higher-than-
average risk of MI or cancer, respectively, and only 39% and 49% of heavy smokers
(40 cigarettes per day) acknowledged these risks. Even among smokers with hyper-
tension, angina, or a family history of MI, 48%, 49%, and 39%, respectively, per-
ceived their risk of MI as higher than average. In multivariate analyses, older (65
years), less educated ( high school graduate), and light smokers (1-19 cigarettes per
day) were less likely than younger, more educated, and heavy smokers to perceive an
increased personal risk of MI or cancer.
Conclusions Most smokers do not view themselves at increased risk of heart dis-
ease or cancer. As part of multifaceted approaches to smoking cessation, physicians
and public health professionals should identify and educate smokers who are not aware
of smoking-related health risks.

lation Survey (October 1995) to calcu-
late poststratification weights so our
cohort who completed both the tele-
phone interview and written question-
naire approximates the distribution of US
adults aged 25-74 years by region, met-
ropolitan area, sex, race, age, educa-
tion, and marital status.
Characteristics of current smokers,
former smokers, and nonsmokers were
compared using analysis of variance for
age and the Pearson x2 test for other vari-
ables. These other variables included sex,
race, education, marital status, geo-
graphic region, having a regular physi-
cian, receiving a checkup in the past year,
history of MI in a parent or sibling, hy-
pertension, angina, overall physical and
mental health, control over life, and sat-
isfaction with life. In a multivariate analy-
sis of current smokers that adjusted for
these variables, we used logistic regres-
sion to assess the relative odds of per-
ceiving higher-than-average risks of MI
and cancer. SUDAAN statistical soft-
ware (Research Triangle Institute, Re-
search Triangle Park, NC) was used to
calculate SEs with the complex sam-
pling design.
RESULTS
Of the 3031 respondents completing the
telephone and self-administered sur-
veys, 737 (24.3%, similar to the 25.5%
reported in the 1994 National Health In-
terview Survey5) were current smokers
and 868 (28.6%) were former smokers.
Current smokers were younger and in-
cluded a higher proportion of women
than former smokers and were younger
and included a higher proportion of men
than nonsmokers (TABLE 1). Current
smokers were less likely to be married
or have graduated from high school than
former smokers or nonsmokers. Cur-
rent smokers were less likely to have a
regular physician or have had a checkup
in the past year, despite reporting worse
physical and mental health. Current
smokers also reported less control over
life and less satisfaction with life than
former smokers or nonsmokers.
Amongcurrentsmokers,only29%and
40% perceived their risk of MI or can-
cer, respectively, as higher than other per-

sons of the same age and sex--approxi-
mately double the proportions of former
smokers(15%and18%,respectively)and
nonsmokers (15% and 17%, respec-
tively) with these perceptions. Among
heavier smokers (40 cigarettes per day),
only 39% and 49%, respectively, per-
ceived themselves at increased personal
risk of heart disease or cancer. Among
smokers who also had hypertension,
symptomatic angina, or a family history
of MI, fewer than half perceived their risk
of MI as higher than average (48%, 49%,
and 39%, respectively).
In multivariate analyses (TABLE 2),
smokers older than 64 years were less
likely than younger smokers to per-
ceive their risk of MI as higher than av-
erage. Smokers older than 44 years and
those who had not graduated from high
school were less likely than younger
smokers and college graduates, respec-
tively, to perceive an increased per-
sonal risk of cancer. Heavier smokers
were more likely than lighter smokers to
perceive an increased risk of MI and can-
cer, and smokers who reported fair or
poor mental health were more likely to
report an increased risk of cancer. Smok-
ers' risk perceptions did not differ sig-
nificantly by sex, race, marital status, geo-
graphic region, access to a regular
physician, or receipt of a checkup in the
prior year.
COMMENT
Despite past efforts to educate smokers
about their health risks, our nationally
representative study demonstrates that
most smokers--even heavy smokers and
those with other cardiac risk fac-
tors--do not perceive themselves at in-
creased risk of experiencing an MI or de-
veloping cancer. Consistent with prior
studies of less-representative cohorts,
many smokers continue to deny their
own personal risks from smoking.15-20
Thus, as a foundation for smoking ces-
sation efforts, physicians and health edu-
cators should assess smokers' risk per-
ceptions and provide more intensive
counseling to those who underestimate
their personal health risks,21,22 particu-
larly older and less-educated smokers. Al-
though physician counseling remains a
cost-effective method to promote smok-
ing cessation,23,24 alternate strategies will
be needed to help smokers who have
greater difficulty quitting and motivate
the one third of smokers who do not have
access to a regular physician.
In interpreting our findings, we note
4 other points. First, questions about
health risks were asked separately from
questions about smoking, so responses
representoverallrisksofheartdiseaseand
cancer rather than risks attributable solely
to smoking. Second, we assessed the risk
of cancer in general rather than specific
types of cancer. Third, although most
smokers are at increased risk of heart dis-
ease and cancer, some smokers may have
a lower relative risk based on their fam-
ily history, diet, or physical activity.
Fourth, future studies should compare
the accuracy of smokers' relative and ab-
solute risk perceptions and determine
how these perceptions influence their
success in quitting smoking.11,20,25
In conclusion, most adults who con-
tinue to smoke in the United States do not
recognize or acknowledge an increased
personal risk of heart disease or cancer.
Because smoking remains the most im-
portant preventable cause of these dis-
eases in the United States, physicians and
public health professionals should edu-
cate smokers about their personal health
risks as part of comprehensive efforts to
promote smoking cessation.
