Datafrom the Longitudinal Study ofAging are used to examine the incidence of nursing home admissions over a six-
year period (1984-1990) among older adults (70 + at T,) living in four different residential contexts. Bivariate
analysis identified significant differences between residence groups. Elders from less urbanized and thinly populated
nonmetropolitan counties had the highest likelihood of admissions, while older residents of large metropolitan areas
had the lowest. In multivariate models, differences by residence could not be accounted for by sociodemographic,
health, and social support network characteristics that are known to influence admissions. Further research is needed
to identify the specific community context factors that account for variation by place of residence in admissions
experiences.
IN most comparisons of social service and health care
resources, older adults who live in sparsely populated and
geographically remote rural communities have a smaller
number and narrower range of services available to them
than persons of the same age who reside in more urban and
suburban places (Coward et al., 1994). This pattern does not
hold, however, for institutionalized care, where recent data
suggest that there is an abundance of nursing home beds in
rural America. Shaughnessy (1994) has reported, for exam-
ple, that there are more nursing home beds per 1,000 elders
(65 +) in nonmetropolitan counties than there are in metro-
politan counties (62 vs 45, respectively). Census data also
confirm that there is a greater prevalence of elders residing in
institutional settings in nonmetropolitan compared to metro-
politan counties (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992). Speci-
fically, in 1990, 6.0 percent of nonmetropolitan elders were
living in institutions, compared to 5.1 percent of metropoli-
tan older adults (see Table 1).
Although both of these types of data (i.e., bed supply and
prevalence of different living arrangements) suggest that
older adults who reside in rural contexts may be at greater
risk of entering a nursing home, neither is a direct measure of
the incidence of admissions (i.e., the rate of occurrence of
new events). Moreover, there are admissions dynamics that
could conceivably disrupt, or reduce, the correspondence
between prevalence and incidence. For example, if there is
substantial cross-over between geographic types (e.g., rural
residents entering nursing homes in urban areas), then esti-
mates based on prevalence could mask the true magnitude of
the differences in incidence that exist between community
contexts. Because an individual can seek care in a locale that
is different from where they live (e.g., choosing a nursing
home that is located closer to where his or her family
resides), patient origin studies are a preferred method of
estimating the effect of community context on service utili-
zation (i.e., examining where a person lives as opposed to
the location of the receipt of the service).
In a similar manner, if discharge patterns were to vary sig-
nificantly by the location of a facility, similar incidence rates
would lead to different prevalence rates. For example, if
residents of rural nursing homes have longer average lengths
of stay compared to urban nursing home residents -- perhaps
because the lack of home health services in rural areas
(Kenney, 1993) makes discharge planning more difficult --
then similar rates of incidence would lead to different rates
of prevalence. Or, if rural residents survive longer than
urban residents after entering a nursing home -- because
they enter younger and less disabled as suggested by Greene
(1984) -- then similar rates of incidence would lead to
different rates of prevalence. Ultimately, the most direct test
of the hypothesis that rural residents are at greater risk of a
nursing home admission than their counterparts who reside
in more urban and-suburban settings is incidence data based
on the place of residence of the elder, not prevalence data
based on the location of the facility.
Two previous studies have compared residential differ-
ences in the incidence of nursing home admissions over time
(Coward, Home, and Peek, 1995; Dwyer, Barton, and
Vogel, 1994). Unfortunately, their findings are completely
contradictory. In the Coward et al. study, rural elders were
more likely to have experienced a nursing home admission
than older adults who resided in more urban and suburban
places, whereas Dwyer and colleagues found that rural
elders had a lower incidence of admission. Although the
inconsistency between these two studies is probably in large
part a function of methodological and definitional differ-
ences, the ability to generalize from either study is severely
constrained because each examined only a limited subset of
the aging population. Coward, Home, and Peek tracked
older adults who were experiencing urinary incontinence,

while Dwyer, Barton, and Vogel examined elders with
chronic difficulties performing activities of daily living
(ADLs) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).
Thus, there is still not creditable evidence of residential
differences in the incidence of nursing home admissions
among older adults because the two studies that have exam-
ined this issue have produced findings that are inconsistent
and cannot be generalized to the full population of elders
who are at risk of being placed in a nursing home.
The supposition that individuals' place of residence will
influence their admission into a nursing home evolves from a
conceptualization of "disability" advanced by Verbrugge
and Jette (1994). They argue that disabilities arise from a
discordance between an individual's functional capacity and
the demands of the environment in which they live. Thus,
whether a specific functional limitation becomes a disability
depends in part on the ecological context in which the person
operates.
There are a number of characteristics of aging in a rural
environment that could potentially reduce the ability of an
older adult to remain living independently in community
settings. For example, as indicated previously, rural elders
have access to a smaller number and narrower range of in-
home (Nelson, 1994), community-based (Krout, 1994), and
ambulatory services (Wallace and Colsher, 1994). There is
evidence that these deficiencies may lead rural elders to
conclude that they have very few alternatives but to enter a
nursing home when their health declines. Specifically,
newly admitted residents of nursing homes from rural areas
are twice as likely as those from more urban and suburban
settings to report that there were services that they had
needed that were not available in the communities where
they lived (Coward, Duncan, and Freudenberger, 1994). At
the same time, the physical isolation of the homes of many
rural elders may contribute to them feeling more apprehen-
sive and uncomfortable about continuing to live indepen-
dently as their health declines or following an acute illness or
fall (Freudenberger-Jett et al., 1996). Perhaps as a conse-
quence of these circumstances, Greene (1984) has observed
that older persons in Arizona who entered nursing homes
from rural areas were younger and less disabled than their
counterparts from more urban and suburban locations.
The primary purpose of this research, therefore, is to
explore further the effect of community context on the
incidence of nursing home admissions. Assuming that resi-
dential differences do exist, our second purpose is to deter-
mine if those differences can be explained by sociodemo-
graphic, health, and social network characteristics that
previous research has identified as influencing a nursing
home placement.
Compared to previous research, there are several impor-
tant improvements in the methods and procedures that we
employ in this study. As a consequence, this investigation
will be in a position to provide better evidence for the
hypothesis that community context affects the odds of an
older adult experiencing a nursing home admission. For
example, the sample that we use includes older adults of all
disability levels, not just those who are functionally im-
paired or who are suffering from a particular chronic illness.
Thus, it is more representative of the full range of older
adults who may potentially seek nursing home care. Second,
we examine all nursing home admissions, not just those of a
duration of 90 days or more (as was done by Dwyer, Barton,
and Vogel, 1994). Liu and Manton (1984) have estimated
that nursing home stays of 90 + days account for slightly
less than half of all admissions. As a consequence, we are
able to address the question of whether there are residential
differences in overall admissions, not just in a subset of
admissions of a certain type. Finally, the residence contin-
uum that we use to compare and contrast the likelihood of
experiencing a'nursing home admission (a variation of the
metropolitan-nonmetropolitan continuum that has been em-
ployed previously by Coward, Home, and Peek, 1995) is
consistent and compatible with previously collected data on
both nursing home bed supply (Shaughnessy, 1994) and the
prevalence of nursing home occupancy (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1992). Therefore, we will be able to make direct
comparisons between these three sources of data, in effect
triangulating evidence on patterns of utilization.
Improving our understanding of potential residential dif-
ferences in nursing home admission rates is important for
several reasons. First, the substantial cost of public subsidies
for nursing home care is a critical concern for elected
officials and policymakers who anticipate a growing need for
such services as the "baby boom" generation reaches old
age. Thus, a better understanding of even modest variations
in use is of consequence because the fluctuations by resi-
dence that have been observed represent thousands of admis-
sions and millions of dollars of expenditures (Coward,
Duncan, and Uttaro, 1996). Second, any effort to minimize
variations in rates of admission is dependent on a better
understanding of the underlying factors that account for the
differences that have been observed. To date, it is not only
unclear whether residential differences in the incidence of
nursing home admissions exist, but also, if they do, whether
the variation that is observed can be attributed to the place of
residence of the elder per se or is a result of other risk factors
that covary with residence.

METHODS
Sampling
The data used in this research are from the Longitudinal
Study of Aging (LSOA), 1984-1990. The baseline data for
the LSOA were collected as part of the Supplement on Aging
to the 1984 National Health Interview Survey. Follow-up
interviews were conducted (by telephone and mail) with a
subsample of the original SOA sample (N = 7,527) in two-
year intervals (1986, 1988, and 1990). In 1986, the LSOA
interviewed only a subset of the full sample. However, when
the full sample was reinterviewed in 1988, individuals (or
their proxies) were asked about their nursing home admis-
sions since the time of their last interview (which for most
was in 1986, but for some was in 1984). Only individuals
who were aged 70 years or older at the time of the original
interview in 1984 were included in the follow-up interviews.
In all subsequent contacts, proxies were interviewed when
possible for all individuals who died, were residing in an
institution, or could not be located.
In this investigation, we use the unweighted LSOA data
for a variety of reasons. First, because weights for the six-
year period are only available for those persons who were
interviewed in 1986, the use of weights would substantially
reduce the size of the sample available for analysis (from
7,527 to 5,151, or a loss of 32% of the sample). Second, the
loss of respondents is not random. That is, those persons
who were interviewed in 1986 are not a random sample of
the full set of respondents. Rather, they are disproportion-
ately representative of the oldest-old (80 +) and minorities.
Third, because of these selection criteria, the proportion of
respondents excluded in 1986 is not uniform across residen-
tial areas (i.e., the criteria result in different sampling
ratios). Fourth, as a consequence of the selection criteria, the
nursing home admission rates for those persons who have
weights (17.1%) are significantly higher than for those re-
spondents without weights (9.2%) (analysis not shown).
Fifth, because our primary focus is a multivariate model that
includes controls for the major factors on which the sample
is weighted (e.g., age, race, and income), the principal
effects of these factors are taken into account. Finally,
previous research has demonstrated that the use of complex
schemes to take into account the disproportionate stratified
multistage cluster sampling design used in the LSOA has
little impact on variance estimation (Fitti and Kovar, 1987;
Wolinskyetal., 1992).
The Dependent Variable
The dependent variable in this analysis is whether the
respondent experienced admission to a nursing home at any
time over the six-year period from 1984-1990 (see Endnote
2 in Coward, Home, and Peek, 1995, for a description of the
exact variables in the LSOA that are used to construct this
measure). If the respondent had been admitted to a nursing
home, the variable was coded " 1 . " If there was no nursing
home admission, it was coded " 0 . " Of the 7,527 elders who
were living in the community in 1984, about one in seven
(14.6% or 1,100 respondents) had experienced a nursing
home admission during the ensuing six-year period.
The Independent Variables
In addition to the place of residence of respondents, we
examined a wide range of other personal characteristics using
LSOA baseline data from 1984. Each of the variables that we
selected for inclusion in the study has been identified in
previous research as a predictor of nursing home admissions.
We organized the variables into three general sets, similar to
those previously employed by Dwyer, Barton, and Vogel
(1994) and Coward, Home, and Peek (1995): sociodemo-
graphic characteristics (Belgrave and Bradsher, 1994;
Branch and Jette, 1982; Dolinsky and Rosenwaike, 1988;
Greene and Ondrich, 1990; Hanley et al., 1990; Headen,
1993; Kemper and Murtaugh, 1991; Liu and Manton, 1984;
Markides, 1989; Newman et al., 1990; Rivlin et al., 1988;
Salive et al., 1993; Speare, Avery, and Lawton, 1991);
health characteristics (Branch and Jette, 1982; Hanley et al.,
1990; Kasper and Shore, 1994; Liu and Manton, 1989;
Shapiro and Tate, 1984; Speare, Avery, and Lawton, 1991);
and social support characteristics (Greene and Ondrich,
1990; Hanley et al., 1990; Kemper, Applebaum, and Har-
rington, 1987; Newman et al., 1990; Palmore, 1976; Speare,
Avery, and Lawton, 1991; Wan and Weissert, 1981).
Sociodemographic characteristics. -- In this study, we
included seven sociodemographic variables that character-
ize the individual. Age, measured in years, was treated as a
continuous variable. Five of the variables (gender, marital
status, race, receipt of Medicaid, and home ownership)
were measured as dichotomies. Respondents were coded
" 1 " when they were male, married, non-White, received
Medicaid, or owned their own home; otherwise, they were
coded " 0 . "
On the original LSOA, the yearly income of respondents
was an ordinal level variable coded into nine categories.
Because of small cell sizes across some of the residence
categories, we collapsed the original income groups into 5
categories: <$5,000; $5,000-$9,999; $10,000-$14,999;
$15,000-$24,999; and $25,000 or more. There were 1,296
elders (17.2% of the full sample), however, who did not
report income. Rather than eliminating these respondents
from the analysis, we explored alternate methods for imput-
ing values for the missing income data (Rovine and Delaney,
1990). For example, we first examined the possibility of
creating a direct estimate of the missing values by employing
regression techniques (using existing data on the demo-
graphic characteristics of the respondents such as age, gen-
der, and race). Because of the weak predictive power of
these variables, however, we abandoned this approach. We
then examined the use of two alternative methods of imputa-
tion: (1) creating a missing value category of income to
determine if individuals who had not reported their income
had rates of institutionalization that were different from
those who had; and (2) randomly assigning income values to
respondents with missing income proportional to their distri-
bution in each of the income values where data were avail-
able, an approach that preserves the central tendency, dis-
persion, and variance of a variable (Beaulieu and Miller,
1984). We estimated models using both techniques (not
shown) and observed the same results. In the Results sec-
RESIDENCE AND NURSING HOME ADMISSIONS S261
tion, however, we report only the model where a missing
value category was employed.
Health characteristics. -- Five variables were used as
indicators of the health and functional status (both physical
and mental) of the elders in the sample. Respondents were
asked to self-rate their health as excellent, very good, good,
fair, or poor and were asked if they had been admitted to a
hospital in the previous 12 months (1 = yes; 0 = no). In
terms of functional health, respondents were asked about
their difficulty performing ADL and IADL tasks. ADL tasks
included difficulties in bathing or showering, dressing, eat-
ing, getting into or out of bed/chair, walking, getting around
outdoors, and using the toilet. IADL tasks included limita-
tions with such activities as meal preparation, shopping,
light and heavy housework, managing money, and using the
telephone. Responses were treated as continuous with a
range of 0-7 for ADL difficulties and 0-6 for IADL difficul-
ties. Fifty-three respondents were missing information on
ADL difficulties and 36 respondents had missing informa-
tion on IADL difficulties. In both cases, we substituted the
mean for those who were missing on the ADL (mean = .71)
or IADL (mean = .73) tasks.
Finally, perceived mental functional status was measured
by two variables: how often respondents had difficulty re-
membering things and how often they got confused. Re-
sponse choices for both questions were: never; frequently;
sometimes; rarely; and had trouble, but unknown how often.
Those respondents who reported frequent problems were
coded as " 1 " ; otherwise, responses were coded as " 0 . "
Responses to both questions were summed to yield a per-
ceived mental status index. Seven hundred forty-seven re-
spondents did not answer these two questions because they
were either mentally or physically incapable (n = 436) or
for other reasons (n = 311) (e.g., they were temporarily
absent). For the mentally infirm, proxies were interviewed
and we aggregated those 436 individuals with the elders who
had reported frequent mental impairments. For those who
gave other responses, we randomly assigned them to either
the frequent or the not frequent groups proportional to the
distribution of those categories in the sample who had
answered the questions (see Beaulieu and Miller, 1984, for a
more complete explanation of this procedure).
Social support characteristics. -- Four social support
characteristics were included in our analysis to measure the
extent of social support available to the respondent. The first
of these is the number of living children, which is a continu-
ous variable ranging from 0 to 18. There were 356 respon-
dents who had missing values on this variable. Because this is
a small number of the overall sample (4.7%), we substituted
the mean number of children (2.45) for those respondents.
Two additional variables indicate whether the elder received
paid or unpaid help from other individuals. In both cases, if
the respondent received help (either paid or unpaid) this was
coded as " 1" and was coded as ' '0'' otherwise. The paid and
unpaid help variables are not mutually exclusive; therefore,
the elder may be receiving both types of help. The final
measure of social support was the elder's living arrangement.
This variable was coded into three categories: lives with
relatives or nonrelatives (no spouse present); lives with a
spouse; and lives alone. The vast majority of those who lived
with a spouse lived in two-person households (87.4%); only a
small proportion lived with a spouse and others.
Area of residence. -- The residence variable in the LSOA
is a variation of the 17-level residence codes established by
the U.S. Department of Agriculture (Gesler and Ricketts,
1992). The basic unit of classification for this scheme is the
county. Counties are first divided into metropolitan and
nonmetropolitan categories (nonmetropolitan counties have
no towns or places with 50,000 or more inhabitants and are
not part of a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area
[SMSA]). Then, within these two classifications, counties
are further divided into groups according to the size of their
population. Metropolitan counties are classified according to
their total population, whereas nonmetropolitan counties are
ordered in terms of the number of "urban" residents in the
county (i.e., the number of persons living in places that have
populations of 2,500 or more residents). Finally, among
nonmetropolitan counties that have similar numbers of "ur-
ban" residents, counties are further divided into those that
are adjacent to a metropolitan county and those that are not.
The LSOA classifies individuals into 10 residence codes.
However, because of the small number of older persons in
some of the categories, combined with the low incidence of
nursing home admissions, we aggregated the 10 categories
into four groups (following the same categorization used
previously by Coward, Home, and Peek, 1995). Thus, the
final residential code included two different types of metro-
politan categories (large and medium to small SMSAs) and
two different types of nonmetropolitan counties (more ur-
banized nonmetropolitan counties and less urbanized and
thinly populated nonmetropolitan counties). Table 2
presents the original LSOA residential coding, the collapsed
categories, the total number of elders in each of the original
residence groups, and the number and percentage of nursing
home admissions experienced in each of the original resi-
dence groups.
RESULTS
Residential Differences in Nursing Home Admissions
and in the Factors That May Influence Admissions
Table 3 presents comparisons of residential differences in
rates of nursing home admissions across the six years of the
LSOA, as well as residential differences in the sociodemo-
graphic, health, and social support characteristics of the
elders in the sample. These distributions are for the un-
weighted sample and, therefore, are not intended as popula-
tion estimates.
The data in the top panel of Table 3 indicate that there
were significant residential differences in the number of
elders who were institutionalized between 1984 and 1990
(chi-square = 9.50; p = .02). Residents of both types of
nonmetropolitan counties (i.e., more urbanized and thinly
populated) had higher percentages of elders who had experi-
enced a nursing home admission across the six-year period
(16.7% and 16.1%, respectively) than their metropolitan

Table 3 also presents the distribution of the total sample
and each of the four residence groups on the sociodemo-
graphic, health, and social support variables that were exam-
ined in this study. These comparisons are informative be-
cause they offer some insight into the factors that might
account for some of the residential variation in nursing home
admission rates that was observed. Indeed, there are many
statistically significant differences between the respondents
who lived in the four residential contexts on these factors
that previous researchers have suggested influence nursing
home admissions..
There was not, however, a uniform pattern that systemati-
cally placed the residents of one community type in a disad-
vantaged position relative to their counterparts who lived in
other settings. Thus, in general, elders living in either type of
nonmetropolitan county, compared to elders living in either
of the two metropolitan county types, would seem to be at
greater risk of a nursing home admission as a result of their

lower incomes, their greater probability of receiving Medic-
aid, their poorer health and functional status, and their poorer
mental capacities. At the same time, these same nonmetropo-
litan elders would seem to be at lower risk of institutionaliza-
tion compared to their metropolitan counterparts as a result of
the higher proportion of males in their population, their
marital status and race, their greater home ownership, and the
larger number of living children they have. It is impossible to
determine from these bivariate comparisons, however, what
proportion of the variation between residence groups in rates
of nursing home admissions is due to residence in a particular
type of community and how much is a function of these other
factors that covary with residence. In the next phase of our
analysis, therefore, we explore the simultaneous effects of
both the residence factor and the sociodemographic, health,
and social network characteristics of the elders on nursing
home admission rates.
Logistic Regression Models Predicting Institutionalization
Results from two nested logistic regression models are
presented in Table 4. In Model 1, the relationship between
residence and a nursing home admission is presented in the
context of a logit model. This model indicates that elders
who live in either metropolitan category (both large and
small to medium sized SMSAs) were significantly less likely
to be admitted to a nursing home than elders who lived in
thinly populated nonmetropolitan areas (the omitted group).
The coefficient for residents of the large SMSAs was -.244
(p < .01) and translates into an odds ratio of .783 (using the
implied coefficient e~(~244). This indicates that older adults
from thinly populated nonmetropolitan counties were 1.28
times more likely to be admitted to a nursing home than
elders living in large metropolitan areas. Similarly, the
nonmetropolitan elders from less urbanized and thinly popu-
lated counties were 1.22 times more likely (p < .05; odds
ratio = .821) to experience a nursing home admission than
elders living in small to medium sized SMSAs (using the
implied coefficient e~(~ 197). In contrast, there was no statisti-
cally significant difference between the elders from the two
nonmetropolitan categories in their rate of experiencing a
nursing home admission. These findings are consistent with
the chi-square analyses reported in Table 3 (top panel) but
indicate more precisely which specific residential groups
have rates of nursing home admissions that are different
from others.
The data in Table 3 also illustrate that there are important
dissimilarities in the composition of the elders who live in
different residential contexts. Thus, our intent in estimating
a second multivariate model was to determine if the effect of
residence on nursing home admission rates could be ex-
plained by other population characteristics that are thought
to influence the probability of entering a nursing home.
Model 2 in Table 4 presents this more fully specified multi-
variate logit model.
The addition of the sociodemographic, health, and social
support characteristics vastly improves the overall fit of
Model 2 compared to Model 1 (change in x2 = 806.81,
change in df = 24, p < .0001). Even in this more fully
specified model, however, the effect of residence on nursing
home admissions remains significant. In Model 2, the coef-

indicates that elders who lived in thinly popu-
lated nonmetropolitan counties were 1.25 times more likely
to be admitted to a nursing home even after adjusting for the
effects of other risks. Similarly, elders from thinly populated
nonmetropolitan counties were 1.24 times more likely (p <
.05; odds ratio = .807) to experience a nursing home
admission compared to elders living in small or medium
sized SMSAs (using the implied coefficient of e~(~-214), net
of the effects of the other characteristics. As was observed in
Model 1, there were no significant differences in the rates of
nursing home admissions between elders living in the two
nonmetropolitan county categories.
Because we had selected characteristics that previous
research had suggested were associated with greater risks of
a nursing home admission, it is not surprising that the data in
Model 2 also indicate that a majority of the other characteris-
tics that we measured were associated with an increased risk
of entering a nursing home. For example, among the so-
ciodemographic variables, elders who were older, not mar-
ried, did not own their home, or who were White were more
likely to be admitted to a nursing home than their counter-
parts in their respective groups. Those who perceived their
health to be poor (compared to those who rated their health
as excellent), those who had experienced a hospitalization in
the previous year, those who had more ADL and IADL
limitations, and those who frequently had problems with
memory and confusion also had increased odds of being
admitted into a nursing home at some point across the six-
year time span. Finally, among the social support character-
istics, those elders who had fewer children, who received
unpaid help, or who lived alone were at greater risk of a
nursing home admission than their counterparts.
In summary, this multivariate analysis demonstrated that
the effect of residence on the odds of experiencing a nursing
home admission was statistically significant net of other risks.
This analysis suggests that the effect of residence on nursing
home admissions is not due only to compositional differences
in the populations; at least with respect to the characteristics
of the individuals, their health status, or their social support
network that were measured in this research.
DISCUSSION
There are two principal findings of this investigation.
First, consistent with existing prevalence data, this investi-
gation found that the incidence of nursing home admissions
varies by the place of residence of the elder. Second, these
differences by residence cannot be accounted for by the
traditional precursors of entering a nursing home that have
been identified in previous literature. Thus, further research
is needed to explain these residential differences.
Although the findings of this investigation are consistent
with previous descriptions of residential variation in both the
supply of nursing home beds (Shaughnessy, 1994) and in the
prevalence of nursing home residence among older adults
(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992), the data and analyses
that have been employed offer an improved test of the
hypothesis that older rural residents are at greater risk of
experiencing a nursing home admission than their counter-
parts who reside in more urban and suburban settings.
Because of the longitudinal nature of the data that were used
(thus the ability to identify new incidences of nursing home
admission), combined with our use of patient origin data and
our ability to track admissions among a general sample of
elders (as opposed to distinct subgroups of older adults), this
investigation provides the best evidence to date that older
adults living in sparsely populated and geographically re-
mote rural environments are at the greatest risk of entering a
nursing home. Given the substantial public subsidies that
underlie nursing home care, this improved understanding
provides a firmer empirical foundation from which future
public policy can evolve.
The finding of a higher incidence of nursing home admis-
sions among rural elders also helps to resolve an inconsis-
tency in the existing literature in this area. Previously,
Dwyer, Barton, and Vogel (1994) reported that rural elders
had a lower incidence of admissions. For the most part, the
inconsistency between these studies is probably a function of
the different coding schemes that were used to depict resi-
dential location. While the present investigation is based on
an underlying metropolitan-nonmetropolitan residential
continuum (identical to that used by Coward, Home, and
Peek, 1995), the Dwyer, Barton, and Vogel (1994) investi-
gation uses an alternative scheme (roughly, but not exactly,
a rural-urban continuum). Although these two methods for
defining place of residence (rural/urban and metropolitan/
nonmetropolitan) are overlapping, they are not coterminous.
Our use of a metropolitan-nonmetropolitan continuum is
also similar to the classification schemes that have been used
in most previous prevalence studies (Shaughnessy, 1994;
U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992) and, as a consequence,
our findings are consistent with those earlier reports.
The second major finding of this investigation is that the
residential differences that were observed cannot be ex-
plained by controlling for the effects of those sociodemo-
graphic, health, and social network characteristics that are
commonly thought to be the precursors of entering a nursing
home. Thus, the explanation of residential differences in
admission experiences lies beyond those factors that are
traditionally used to account for observed variations. Further
research is needed to identify the specific community context
factors that account for variation in admissions by place of
residence.
There are several lines of inquiry for future research that
would appear to be promising, if data were available to
examine them. For example, geographical differences in the
supply of nursing home beds (Shaughnessy, 1994) and in the
availability of home- and community-based alternatives to
nursing home care (Kenney, 1993; Kenney and Dubay,
1992) need to be taken into account. Unfortunately, we
know of no data source that permits the researcher interested
in patterns of use to examine simultaneously the need for
care (i.e., the sociodemographic, health, and social support
characteristics that are associated with needing nursing
home care), the supply and availability of specific services
(including nursing home beds and alternatives to nursing
home care), and nursing home admissions rates over time.
Our source of data, the LSOA, has information on only two
of these three dimensions. As a consequence, we were
S266 COWARD ET AL.
unable to take into account geographic variability in the
services that are available to respondents, although we are
well aware that there are important discrepancies between
locales (Coward et al., 1994).
In a similar manner, there are also some emerging qualita-
tive studies that indicate that the attitudes of older persons
about the possibility of entering a nursing home may vary by
place of residence (Freudenberger-Jett et al., 1996; Rowles,
Concotelli, and High, 1996; Schoenberg and Coward, in
press). These authors argue that the greater familiarity of
rural residents with nursing home facilities (Schoenberg and
Coward, in press), the greater involvement of rural nursing
home residents in community-based activities (Rowles,
Concotelli, and High, 1996), and the greater use of nursing
home facilities by rural residents for community-sponsored
activities (Rowles, Concotelli, and High, 1996) may result
in less reluctance among rural older persons about the
possibility of entering a nursing home. Future researchers
may want to take into account the possibility of such attitudi-
nal differences toward nursing home care as they seek
explanations for residential differences in patterns of use.
Although the LSOA is an excellent source of information
about patterns of long-term care over time,-there are, never-
theless, some limitations to the data set. For example, we
were unable to distinguish between long-term and short-term
admissions. Thus, it is unclear if the differences in overall
nursing home admission rates by residence that we observed
in this investigation are present in both short-term and long-
term admissions or if they are concentrated in one or the
other type. We also only have information on the place of
residence of respondents at Time 1. Therefore, we are
unable to track the degree to which individuals change their
place of residence, particularly those who cross residence
categories, as their health declines. Litwak and Longino
(1987) have suggested that older persons do migrate to be
closer to family members as their health declines. In a
similar manner, Clifford et al. (1985) have speculated that
rural elders who become widowed are more likely to move
from remote isolated places of residence to larger population
centers to be nearer health and human services that they
might need than elders who already reside in more urban and
suburban settings. Unfortunately, we are unable to describe
any of these potential movements across residence catego-
ries prior to elders entering a nursing home.
In addition, the methods we employed to analyze the data
have their limits. For example, it could be argued that place
of residence is an endogenous variable in our models and,
thus, its effect on nursing home admissions should be esti-
mated as a two-equation recursive system. Moreover, if self-
selection into place of residence is nonrandom, it would also
be necessary to correct for such a self-selection bias. Be-
cause both endogenous variables (i.e., residence and nursing
home admissions) are discrete, the correction would require
the estimation of a bivariate logit or probit with selection
(Dubin and Rivers, 1990). In the future, researchers may
want to employ such alternative methods for modeling these
relationships.
The analytical approach that we have taken in this investi-
gation could be characterized as the "long view." That is,
we have taken characteristics of the older person and their
environment at Time 1 (T,; 1984) and examined their ability
to predict an event over the course of a six-year period of
time. Although this approach is common in social gerontol-
ogy, and provides meaningful and useful information about
the personal characteristics and conditions that are the ante-
cedents of a particular outcome (in this case, a nursing home
admission), this approach offers little insight into the con-
temporary events and circumstances that are associated with
an incident. Thus, in addition to research that takes this
"long view" on nursing home admissions, we also need
detailed investigations that attempt to identify and describe
residential differences in the specific events and processes
that precipitate a nursing home admission and the conse-
quences of these different pathways to nursing homes on the
lives of older adults and their families. It may be, for
example, that different types of events are the immediate
precipitators of a nursing home admission in a rural setting
compared to a more urban or suburban environment
(Freudenberger-Jett etal., 1996).
