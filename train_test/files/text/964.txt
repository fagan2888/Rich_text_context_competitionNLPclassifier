Effects of Reporting Source on Asthma Risk Factor Conclusions Miller
Predictors of Asthma in Young Children: Does Reporting Source Affect Our
Conclusions?
Jane E. Miller
Both the size and statistical significance of sociodemographic and early health risk factors on childhood
asthma vary across studies, in part because some studies rely on parents' retrospective reports of health
conditions while others are based on medical records. The authors compare predictors of asthma alternately
using maternal reports and medical records for the same set of children. Data are from the 1988 National
Maternal and Infant Health Survey and 1991 Longitudinal Follow-up, which collected information from birth
certificates, medical records, and mothers of a nationally representative, population-based cohort, allowing
comparison across data sources for a consistent sample of young children in the United States. Concordance
between maternal reports and medical records on asthma is moderate (kappa = 0.48). The authors find
considerable discrepancies in both the estimated prevalence of asthma and the distribution across children with
different sociodemographic and health characteristics, depending on the source of asthma data. Black race,
male gender, and preterm birth are found to be risk factors for asthma regardless of data source. Poverty, large
family size, urban residence, maternal smoking, and breastfeeding are significantly associated with asthma
based on maternal reports but not medical records. Lower health care utilization among poor, uninsured, and
urban children may account for part of the discrepancy. Am J Epidemiol 2001;154:245­50.

Asthma is the leading chronic illness among children in
the United States (1, 2). The prevalence of asthma has been
rising steadily over the past few decades, particularly
among children (3). A variety of sociodemographic, health,
and health behaviors have been implicated as risk factors
for asthma, including income, race, family structure, resi-
dence, and smoking (4­11). Estimates of the risk associated
with each of those predictors vary in both size and statisti-
cal significance, in part because some studies rely on par-
ents' retrospective reports of health conditions (1, 5, 6,
8­10), while others are based on medical records or on clin-
ical examination at the time of the study (7, 11). Maternal
reports may suffer from recall bias as well as the fact that
few parents have been trained in how to diagnose asthma or
to differentiate it from other respiratory conditions.
Medical records data overcome those drawbacks but typi-
cally are available only for children who use a particular
health care provider. Hence, they cannot be used to gener-
alize about patterns of health or health care utilization in the
general population. The design of the studies from which
data are drawn also varies, complicating the comparison of
asthma findings.
In this paper, we compare predictors of asthma using two
different criteria to identify cases: maternal reports and
medical records. We make use of a unique data set that col-
lected information from birth certificates, medical records,
and mothers of a nationally representative, population-based
cohort, which allows us to compare across two different
reporting sources for the same sample of young children. We
find considerable discrepancies in not only the estimated
prevalence of asthma but also its distribution across children
with different sociodemographic and health characteristics,
depending on the source reporting on asthma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data were extracted from the 1988 National Maternal and
Infant Health Survey (NMIHS) and its companion 1991
Longitudinal Follow-up (LF). The NMIHS was based on a
sample of birth certificates for children born in 1988, and it
oversampled Black infants and low birth weight infants. In
1988 and 1991, mothers of sampled children were sent ques-
tionnaires that requested information about demographic
background, socioeconomic characteristics, and the child's
health (12, 13). Overall, 83 percent of the livebirths from the
NMIHS participated in the 1991 Longitudinal Follow-up.
At follow-up, mothers were asked to list the names and
addresses of all medical care providers visited by the sam-
pled child since birth, and they were asked to grant consent
for the National Center for Health Statistics to request all
246 Miller
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 154, No. 3, 2001
medical records for that child from those providers. Consent
was granted by 94 percent of mothers. Consent rates did not
differ significantly according to the sociodemographic char-
acteristics of the mother or child. If consent was given, a
questionnaire was sent to each named provider asking for
information on the type of provider, the reasons for each
visit, and any diagnoses or procedures that occurred at that
visit. The Medical Provider Survey data file comprises
99,117 records, one for each reported visit to a medical
provider. Seventy-seven percent of the nominated providers
supplied medical visit data for 6,159 children, 75 percent of
those present at follow-up (14). A discussion of selectivity
of provider response is described elsewhere (15).
For this analysis, a maternal report of asthma was based
on a response of "yes" to the question on the 1991 mother's
questionnaire: "Have you ever been told by a doctor, nurse,
or other medical provider that the sampled child had
asthma?" As shown in very poor concurrence with the doc-
tor's diagnosis data (see below), however, these data appear
to reflect the mother's opinion of whether the child has
asthma; hence, we refer to them as "maternal reports of
asthma." A doctor's diagnosis of asthma was based on men-
tion of asthma on a medical record in either a checklist of
possible conditions or a listing of asthma by name or
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification, code 493.0 as a diagnosis for any
visit (16). Medical providers had the option of filling the
information for each visit into a National Center for Health
Statistics form or attaching a copy of the medical records for
the sampled child. Information on the gestational age, gen-
der, and race of the infant was drawn from the birth certifi-
cate; information on breastfeeding, smoking, child care,
household composition, income, and residence from the
mother's questionnaires at baseline and follow-up; and
information on other diagnoses from the medical records.
To investigate whether the sociodemographic and health
predictors of early childhood asthma depend on the source
of asthma report, we estimated logistic regression models of
1) a medical provider diagnosis of asthma or 2) a maternal
report of asthma. The two models were estimated with the
same set of predictor variables, using only the 6,159 chil-
dren for whom both maternal and medical records data were
available at the time of follow-up. Analysis of medical
records data from the NMIHS/LF showed that children who
received health care in clinics had Medicaid or no insurance
and were members of a racial or ethnic minority, and that
those who lived in an urban area were more likely than other
children to be excluded from our analysis because none of
their medical providers responded. Moreover, those same
attributes were associated with having some, but not all, per-
tinent medical providers respond; hence, it is possible that a
doctor's diagnosis could be overlooked because some of the
child's medical records were not available for analysis (15).
To test the sensitivity of our results to completeness of med-
ical records, we compare results of models for the sample of
children for whom all nominated providers responded (65
percent of the overall sample) with those for the full sample.
Prevalence estimates are weighted to the population level
using the sampling weights provided by the National Center
for Health Statistics for the 1991 Longitudinal Follow-up.
Sampling weights are calibrated to be representative of chil-
dren born in the United States in 1988 who were alive at the
time of the follow-up and to incorporate adjustments for the
initial sampling design as well as loss to follow-up (13).
Logistic regression is used to examine the effects of
sociodemographic and health factors on chances of an
asthma diagnosis by the time of the 1991 Longitudinal
Follow-up. Estimated standard errors were corrected for
complex sampling using SUDAAN computer software (17).
RESULTS
Overall, the mother, the medical provider, or both identi-
fied 1,094 cases of asthma. Thirty-six percent of the cases
were mentioned by both the mother and the medical
provider, 36 percent by the mother only (e.g., the mother but
not the medical provider), and the remaining 27 percent by
the medical provider only. The kappa statistic for concur-
rence between maternal reports and medical records was
0.48, indicating moderate agreement (18, 19). When we
restricted the sample to those children for whom all medical
providers responded, the kappa statistic was 0.47, suggest-
ing that incomplete provider response did not explain the
difference between the two sources' reports of asthma.
Mothers were more likely to recall and report serious cases
of asthma, such as those that resulted in a hospitalization.
However, there is surprisingly poor concurrence between
maternal reports and medical records, even for relatively
severe cases. For only 79 percent of the 190 children with
medical records that indicated hospitalization for asthma did
their mother report that the child had ever been diagnosed
with asthma. Inclusion of children hospitalized for other seri-
ous respiratory conditions in the comparison (n  241)
resulted in only slightly higher agreement (80 percent).
Estimates of asthma prevalence differ substantially
depending on which reporting source is used: Weighted to
national levels, the prevalence estimates for asthma in the
sample were 7.7 percent based on medical records or 10.0
percent based on maternal reports. Restricting the definition
of "cases" to those for whom both the mother and medical
provider mention asthma yields a prevalence of 4.1 percent;
broadening the definition to include any child for whom
either the mother or medical provider reported the condition
yields a prevalence of 13.6 percent.
Table 1 presents characteristics of children according to
whether they had asthma reported by 1) both the doctor and
mother (400 children), 2) the mother only (n  406), 3) the
doctor only (n  299), or 4) neither the doctor nor the
mother (e.g., no asthma reported; n  5,054). Doctor-only
cases were more likely to be non-Hispanic White, nonpoor,
and from smaller families in which the mother did not
smoke but did breastfeed. Asthma cases reported by both the
mother and the doctor had a higher average number of med-
ical visits since birth than those for whom either one or the
other source reported asthma. Mother-only cases were con-
siderably more common among children for whom some
providers did not respond to the survey (47.6 percent com-
pared with 28.6 percent and 26.5 percent of mother-and-

doctor or doctor-only cases), raising the possibility that the
child had been diagnosed with asthma by a doctor, but that
the pertinent medical records were not included in the data-
base.
Logistic regression models of asthma were estimated
using either a doctor's diagnosis of asthma (whether or not
the mother also reported asthma) or a maternal report of
asthma (whether or not a doctor also reported asthma) (table
2). Relations between several of the sociodemographic or
health variables and asthma were consistent whether a doc-
tor's diagnosis or a mother's report of asthma is used as the
indicator of an asthma case. A gestational age of less than 28
weeks and a gestational age of 28­33 weeks, male gender,
and Black race were associated with elevated risks of
asthma in either model (p < 0.05 for all variables). However,
for each of those variables except gender, the estimated odds

ratios were larger based on the maternal report than on the
medical records indicator of asthma.
Moreover, several additional variables (poverty, having
three or more siblings, urban residence (p < 0.06), mater-
nal smoking, and lack of breastfeeding) were significant
predictors of asthma when maternal reports were used as
the asthma indicator but not when medical records were
the source of asthma diagnosis. For each of those predic-
tors, the estimated odds ratio was larger in the maternal
report model.
When we reestimated the model using only the subset of
children for whom all medical providers had responded
("complete provider response"), only preterm birth and
male gender were statistically significant risk factors for
asthma according to a doctor's diagnosis. The maternal
report model for the complete provider response sample
again yielded a broader set of risk factors than the doctor's
diagnosis model, including non-Hispanic Black race, mater-
nal smoking, and no breastfeeding. The effects of poverty
and a large number of siblings were no longer significant.

Effects of Reporting Source on Asthma Risk Factor Conclusions 249
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 154, No. 3, 2001
The odds ratios for the effect of poverty on asthma were
much more similar for the two reporting sources in the com-
plete provider response models (odds ratios  1.24 and 1.37
for doctor's diagnosis and maternal reports, respectively)
than in the models using the full sample (odds ratios  1.05
and 1.41, respectively), as the odds ratio increased substan-
tially for the doctor's diagnosis model with complete
provider response. In both the mother's and doctor's models
with the complete provider sample, poverty did not attain
statistical significance, in part because of the much smaller
sample size than in the full sample model (n  3,883 and
6,159, respectively).
DISCUSSION
An analysis of data for a nationally representative cohort
reveals substantial discrepancy in maternal reports and med-
ical records of asthma among young children. Maternal
reports yield not only a higher estimate of asthma preva-
lence but also a different distribution, with wider variation
across a larger number of sociodemographic and health
behaviors. When maternal reports of asthma are used to
identify asthma cases, poverty, large family size, maternal
smoking, not having been breastfed, and urban residence are
all statistically significantly associated with a greater risk of
asthma in multivariate models. When medical records are
used to identify asthma cases in the same sample of chil-
dren, none of those factors is significant. Although previous
research has examined how characteristics of the mother or
child affect the concordance of child health data sources (15,
20), those studies have not taken the additional step of look-
ing at how discordance affects conclusions about which
groups are at higher risk of poor health.
Our findings offer insight that is not available from
comparing results of studies of asthma based on medical
records against results of different studies based on mater-
nal reports (21). Because the NMIHS/LF draws data from
medical records and maternal reports for the same set of
children, it is possible to rule out differences in study
design or sample as reasons for the observed discrepancies
between those sources in estimated asthma prevalence and
distribution. A handful of other studies with data from both
types of sources have also shown substantial discordance
between maternal reports and physical examination results
for children. Using data from the Health Examination
Survey, Jessop and Stein (21) found that maternally
reported asthma was often not mentioned in the clinical
findings. Similar patterns across conditions have been
observed for adult health (22).
Some of the inconsistency in the published literature
regarding the prevalence and distribution of asthma among
children stems from differences in definition or measure-
ment of asthma. For example, patterns of point prevalence
of asthma at the time of screening via questionnaire or clin-
ical examination differ from patterns of annual prevalence
(in the 12 months prior to the study), which in turn will dif-
fer from those for cumulative or lifetime prevalence because
of variations in symptoms across a child's lifetime (9). Both
of the reporting sources used in this analysis provide esti-
mates of cumulative prevalence. Hence, differences across
sources cannot be attributed to that factor.
A possible drawback to the comparison of data from the
two reporting sources in the NMIHS/LF is that the length of
the recall period is far shorter for the medical records than
for the mother's reports. Data are recorded in the medical
chart immediately after a patient's visit, but the mothers
were asked to report on their child's health over a 3-year
period. Nonetheless, the patterns seen in the maternal report
data from the NMIHS/LF are likely to be typical of those for
health surveys that retrospectively collect information on
cumulative or lifetime prevalence (22), although they prob-
ably overstate recall bias for estimates for shorter time peri-
ods such as 3 months or 12 months, intervals often used in
health surveys such as the National Health Interview Survey
or the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
Another weakness of these data is that roughly one third
of children were missing medical records for one or more of
their health care providers, raising the possibility that they
had in fact been diagnosed with asthma by a doctor but that
information was missing from the data set. However, incom-
plete provider response does not appear to explain differ-
ences between maternal reports and medical records in the
set of risk factors identified for asthma. When we reesti-
mated the model for doctor's report of asthma focusing only
on children for whom all providers responded to the survey,
the same set of risk factors was statistically significant as in
the model with both complete and incomplete medical
records, although the poverty effect became larger and
closer to statistical significance.
An issue that affects the study of asthma risk factors
among young children is the difficulty in diagnosing asthma
in this age group, including such issues as differentiating
between bronchitis and asthma and the different criteria for
the frequency and severity of wheezing and other respira-
tory symptoms. However, although these factors introduce
variability across doctors in the diagnosis of asthma, they
are unlikely to explain the observed discrepancies between
doctors' diagnoses and maternal reports of asthma.
Another possible reason for the discrepancy between
maternal reports and medical records in these data is that
reactive airway disease (a term used by many physicians
who suspect but are not yet ready to name asthma) will be
coded as 493.0 (asthma) unless the physician specifically
notes "reactive airway disease, not asthma" on the patient's
chart (23). For those visits, the parent would not be told the
child had asthma, yet the medical record data would be
coded as mentioning asthma. This type of error could affect
other health surveys that rely on parents' reports of asthma.
Similar errors could occur with other health conditions in
instances where the physician uses a synonym for a health
condition that doesn't match the precise terminology or cod-
ing that would be written on medical charts and, hence,
might not match the wording on a health survey. For exam-
ple, the 1991 Longitudinal Follow-up asks about "chronic
orthopedic problems," which a parent might not recognize
as synonymous with "bone or joint disease."
When considering the implications of the observed dis-
cordance between maternal reports and medical records on
250 Miller
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 154, No. 3, 2001
asthma or other health conditions, one should note that nei-
ther reporting source can be considered to be the definitive
"gold standard" against which the other should be judged
(21). Medical records are completed at the time of each visit
by trained medical providers who are familiar with diagnos-
tic criteria. Hence, medical records are less likely to suffer
from either recall bias or misdiagnosis than are the retro-
spective maternal reports. However, if children are not taken
to a physician for a particular health problem, that problem
will be overlooked in the medical records.
Evidence from other studies suggests that differences in
health care utilization may be an important factor in
accounting for the higher prevalence estimates based on the
maternal reports than on the medical records. Children from
urban areas, low income families, and those families lacking
health insurance are less likely to receive medical care for
asthma (10, 24), reducing the chances that they will be diag-
nosed. Joseph et al. (25) showed that a substantial share of
school-aged children had clinical evidence of asthma
despite a lack of a physician's diagnosis of the condition. In
a study of discrepant reporting of asthma, Miller et al. (15)
showed that mother-only reports were nearly twice as com-
mon and that physician-only reports were only 60 percent as
common among children from poor families. Children who
did not have health insurance were also more likely to have
asthma reported by their mother but not by a medical
provider. These findings suggest that analyses based on
medical charts or discharge records are likely to understate
the deleterious effects of socioeconomic disadvantage on
the risk of asthma or other health conditions.
