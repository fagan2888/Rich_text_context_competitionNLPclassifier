Abstract. Objective: To describe the incidence and
patient characteristics of traumatic brain injuries
(TBIs) treated in U.S. emergency departments (EDs).
Methods: A secondary analysis was performed on
data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical
Care Survey administered from 1992 to 1994. An ED
visit was determined to represent a case of TBI if the
case record contained ICD-9-CM codes of 800.0­
801.9, 803.0­804.9, or 850.0­854.1. Results: The av-
erage annual estimate of new TBI treated in U.S.
EDs was 1,144,807, equaling 444 per 100,000 persons
(95% CI = 390 to 498), which represents approxi-
mately 3,136 new cases of TBI per day and accounts
for 1.3% of all ED visits. Males were 1.6 times as
likely as females to suffer TBI until the age of 65
years, when the female rate exceeded the male. The
rate for blacks was 35% higher than that for whites.
The highest overall incidence rate of TBI occurred in
the less-than-5-year age group (1,091 per 100,000),
closely followed by the more-than-85-year age group
(1,026 per 100,000). Falls represented the most com-
mon mechanism of TBI injury, followed by motor ve-
hicle-related trauma. Conclusions: This study under-
scores the ongoing need for effective surveillance of
all types of TBI and evaluation of prevention strate-
gies targeting high-risk individuals. It serves as a
clinically grounded and ED-based corroboration of
prior survey research, providing a basis for compari-
son of incidence rates over time and a tool with which
to measure the efficacy of future interventions. Key

TRAUMATIC brain injury (TBI) is a signifi-
cant source of morbidity and mortality in the
United States, accounting for approximately one-
third of injury-related deaths.1 The magnitude of
TBI mandates a thorough understanding of the ep-
idemiology of these injuries, in order to elucidate
risk factors for TBI and design appropriately tar-
geted prevention programs.
Data on TBI-related mortality are readily avail-
able.2 Estimates of the incidence of nonfatal TBI
have been reported through population surveys,
medical record reviews, and hospital and trauma
registries. Though methodologies and case defini-
tions vary considerably, hospital admission studies
conducted in the 1970s and 1980s revealed an
overall incidence rate of approximately 200 per

100,000. Sixteen studies reviewed by Kraus
showed that the rate varied from 152 to 376 per
100,000.3
Few studies have specifically analyzed the pre-
sentation of TBI to emergency departments (EDs).
Most have relied on hospital admission data,4 al-
though one study conducted in Minnesota included
ED visits and outpatient examinations involving
residents in a single county.5 Diamond reviewed
data from the Virginia Brain Injury Central Reg-
istry for 1988­1993, which included ED visits, and
found the incidence highest for children less than
6 (237 per 100,000) and lowest for ages 40­69 (56
per 100,000).6
Sosin et al. performed an analysis of the 1991
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (a na-
tionally representative random household survey),
and used the Injury Supplement data to charac-
terize the national incidence of mild and moderate
TBI. The principal outcome measure was a report
of head injury resulting in a loss of consciousness
within the previous 12 months. Their results re-
vealed an annual brain-injury rate of 618 per
100,000 persons, of which 25% did not receive med-
ical care, 14% were treated on an outpatient basis,
35% were treated and released from EDs, and 25%
were admitted to a hospital. Medically attended
brain injuries were found to involve 1.16 million
civilians, corresponding to an annual rate of 465

per 100,000 persons. Cases of TBI in which pa-
tients were treated in EDs or admitted to hospitals
numbered 935,000, for a rate of 376 per 100,000
persons.7
To our knowledge, no other nationally represen-
tative population-based study of TBI incidence
among patients presenting to EDs has been pub-
lished. The purpose of the current study, therefore,
is to quantify the incidence and describe the char-
acteristics of patients who experience TBI and are
seen in EDs using a national database.
METHODS
Study Design. We conducted a secondary anal-
ysis of the ED component of the 1992­1994 Na-
tional Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
(NHAMCS). The original intent of the NHAMCS
was to provide national estimates of the care pro-
vided in hospital EDs and outpatient departments.
Our goal was to describe the incidence, demo-
graphics, and characteristics of patients diagnosed
as having TBI who present to U.S. EDs. The study
was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
Allegheny University of the Health Sciences.
Data Source. As detailed elsewhere,8­11 the
NHAMCS is a national probability survey of visits
to emergency and outpatient departments of non-
institutional, general and short-stay hospitals (ex-
cluding federal, military, and Veterans Affairs hos-
pitals) located within the 50 states (and the
District of Columbia). The NHAMCS is adminis-
tered by the Division of Health Care Statistics,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
It uses a four-stage probability design that in-
cludes geographic primary sampling units (PSUs),
hospitals within PSUs, EDs within hospitals, and
patients within EDs. The first-stage sample con-
sisted of 112 PSUs comprising a probability sub-
sample of the 1,900 geographically defined PSUs
used in the 1985­1994 National Ambulatory Med-
ical Care Survey (NAMCS). The PSUs used in the
NHAMCS were then selected with a probability
proportional to their size. The intent of this com-
plex sampling design was to establish the gener-
ated data as representative of the U.S. population.
In the recruitment and orientation phase of the
survey, the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) employed experienced interviewers spe-
cially prepared for recruiting hospitals and train-
ing hospital personnel in survey-specific data col-
lection procedures. Data collection occurred over a
randomly assigned four-week period for each hos-
pital and was the responsibility of the hospital
staff. A separate data collection form was filled out
at or near the time of the visit. A total of 91,935
patient forms were processed for 1992­1994. Once
completed, the forms were sent to the NCHS,
where ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes and E-codes (ex-
ternal cause) were assigned using the data collec-
tion form--not the original medical record. Coding
from the data collection forms was done centrally
by experienced NCHS nosologists. Quality assur-
ance procedures included a 10% sample of inde-
pendently processed survey records to ascertain
coding quality. Coding error rates are reported in
the NHAMCS as no more than 2% for the different
fields.12 The combined 1992­1994 data set repre-
sents approximately 274 million ED visits (close to
91 million visits per year). Each visit was assigned
a statistical weight in order to generate annual na-
tional estimates for the three-year period.
Definition and Case Selection. In accordance
with the CDC surveillance guidelines for TBI,13 an
ED visit was classified as a case of TBI if it con-
tained one of the following ICD-9-CM codes within
the primary, secondary, or tertiary diagnosis fields:
800.0­801.9, ``fracture of the vault or base of the
skull''; 803.0­804.9, ``other and unqualified and
multiple fractures of the skull''; or 850.0­854.1,
``intracranial injury, including concussion, contu-
sion, laceration, and hemorrhage.'' More than 92%
of the cases were identified from the primary di-
agnosis field. Although ``injury, first visit'' and ``in-
jury, follow-up'' data items were included in the
1992 data collection forms, these variables were
not present in the 1993 and 1994 data forms.
Given that only 4.5% of ED visits for TBI were
listed as ``injury, follow-up'' visits in the 1992 data
set, it was not deemed necessary to adjust data
from subsequent years to avoid double counting of
follow-up visits to determine incidence. Out-of-hos-
pital deaths and injuries treated in non-ED out-
patient settings were excluded from this data set.
Estimates of payments for TBI-related ED visits
were determined using a payment model based
on the average reimbursement of a non-NCHS/
NHAMCS sample of actual ED visits for the same
ICD-9- coded injuries. This model did not include
follow-up visits, inpatient care, or non-ED-related
charges.
Data Analysis. Data were obtained from the
NCHS on diskette in ASCII format and analyzed
using SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). In-
formation from all three years was combined and
averaged to provide mean annual estimates of na-
tional ED visits. The entire database was searched
using the ICD-9-CM codes defining TBI, 1,141 of
which met the case definition. Rates were calcu-
lated using mid-year 1993 population figures from
the U.S. Census Bureau. Confidence intervals
were calculated using approximate relative stan-
dard errors as percentages (based on recommen-

(95% CI = 1,004,902 to 1,284,711), corresponding

persons. These visits accounted for approximately

annual average, 1992­1994 (approximate 95% confidence intervals are shown).
1.3% of all ED visits during the period of study.
Table 1 contains numbers and rates for age, sex,
race, weekday or weekend, place of injury, mech-
anism, diagnosis, and whether the patient was ad-
mitted or transferred. Three incidence peaks were
present: the highest was for children in the first
five years of life (1,091 per 100,000), closely fol-
lowed by adults aged 85 years and older (1,026 per
100,000), and finally adolescents and young adults
aged 15 to 24 years (639 per 100,000). Incidence
rates by age and sex are shown in Figure 1. The
overall TBI incidence rate for males (557 per
100,000; 95% CI = 477 to 637) was 1.6 times that
for females (336 per 100,000; 95% CI = 279 to 393).
The sex ratio varies by age grouping and is highest
in the 5­14-year age group (2.5 times), is less pro-
nounced in children aged 0­4 years (1.3 times),
and is reversed in the more-than-65-year age cate-
gory, where the female rate (402 per 100,000) is 1.5
times that of the male (268 per 100,000). A sub-
group of women aged more than 85 years showed
a rate of 1,303 per 100,000 persons, and more than
70% of these cases were fall-related. Although the
frequency of TBI in the white population (921,580
per year) was five times that in the black popula-
tion (187,167), the population-based incidence rate
of TBI among blacks (582 per 100,000; 95% CI =
439 to 725) was 35% higher than that among
whites (429 per 100,000; 95% CI = 375 to 485). The
rate of TBI among nonblack, nonwhites was 333
per 100,000 (95% CI = 155 to 512). One third of
total TBI cases occurred on Saturday and Sunday.
The incidence of head injury was highest from May
through October and was lowest from January
through March.
For those cases of head trauma carrying a
``place of injury'' designation (66%), one-fifth took
place at a home and one-fifth occurred on a street
or highway. More than half of the TBIs sustained
at a home were in the 0­9-year age group, and
represented 62% of head injuries within this group.
Most TBI cases (93%) were assigned a ``cause of
injury'' designation. Falls represented the most
common cause of injury (39%), followed by motor
vehicle-related trauma (23%) and the category
``struck by or against'' (23%). Pedestrian and bicy-
cle-related injuries accounted for 6.2% of all inju-
ries, and three-fourths of these (77%) occurred in
the 0­14-year age group. The ``other'' category rep-
resented 8.7% of injuries. Assault-related injuries
(8.9% of the total) were contained in both the
``struck by and against'' category and the ``other''
grouping. These findings are summarized in Fig-
ure 2. Examination by specific age groups reveals
that falls constituted the most common mechanism
of head injury in children less than 9 years of age
(50% of all falls) and in those aged more than 50
years. Three-fourths of motor vehicle-related TBI
occurred in the 15­44-year age groups and males
accounted for 60% of these injuries.
More than one-half (54%) of ICD diagnoses in
the primary diagnosis field were coded as ``intra-
cranial injury of other or unspecified nature'' (ICD
854). An additional 14% comprised concussion

ment visits by injury mechanism--excludes cases in

(ICD 850), 3.5% were skull fractures (ICD 800,
801, 803), and 2.5% were coded as cerebral lacer-
ation, contusion, or intracranial hemorrhage (ICD
851­853). The remaining 26% represented all
other diagnoses meeting the case definition in the
primary diagnosis field.
One-fifth of the total patients were either ad-
mitted, transferred to another facility, or found to
be dead upon arrival to the ED. Cardiopulmonary
resuscitation and endotracheal intubation were
performed in 3% of the cases. Initial ED triage
classified 71% of visits as urgent-emergent and
29% as nonurgent. Although 17.3% of the patients
were coded as ``admission to hospital,'' it is reason-
able to conclude that the 2.9% of the patients who
were transferred to another facility were ulti-
mately admitted as well, leading to a total admis-
sion rate of 20.2%, or 90 per 100,000 persons.
Medicaid, Medicare, and other government
sources were indicated as payors in 30% of TBI
cases seen in the ED. The total dollar estimate for
annual TBI-related ED charges was $346 million.
DISCUSSION
Our study reveals that every year, 444 of every
100,000 persons are evaluated in EDs for TBI.
Males and blacks were found to have higher over-
all rates of TBI. Rates of TBI were highest among
the very young and elders; and a smaller peak was
present within the 15­24-year age group. Falls
represented a larger proportion of TBI than has
been seen in other studies. The majority of these
occurred in younger children and elders. The sub-
group of women older than 85 years represents the
highest rate of TBI, the majority of which were due
to falls (71%). Motor vehicle-related trauma ac-
counted for 23% of TBI and, although present in
all age groups, was most common in men between
the ages of 16 and 45 years.
The current study supports several of the con-
clusions reached by Sosin et al. in the NHIS.7 A
comparison of the two also helps put our data in
perspective. The estimate of 1.14 million annual
cases of TBI with a corresponding rate of 444 per
100,000 persons found in the present study is 18%
higher than that extrapolated from rates deter-
mined by Sosin et al. Rates of TBI by sex were
comparable. The male rate was 3.8% lower in our
study (579 vs 557), and the female rate was 5.8%
lower (336 vs 357). Comparative rates of TBI dif-
fered more by race; the rate for whites was 8%
lower and that for blacks was 23% higher in the
present study. The estimated hospital admission
rate of 90 per 100,000 persons (including admis-
sions and transfers) is significantly lower than that
found in the NHIS analysis (158 per 100,000), but
is closer to rates found in the five-state survey
where rates between 84 and 112 per 100,000 were
noted.4 Sosin et al. found assaults to represent 9%
of total TBI cases in the NHIS study, similar to our
study. Several explanations for the discrepancies
found between these two studies exist, including
somewhat different case definitions, the potential
for recall bias when using telephone survey meth-
ods, and the potential imprecision of using ICD-9
codes to quantify TBI. Nevertheless, the majority
of findings of these two population-based ED stud-
ies were similar, thereby strengthening our under-
standing of the epidemiology of TBI.
The injury pyramid provides a model whereby
the burden of an injury on a population may be
evaluated at different levels of medical treatment.
The height represents increasing injury severity
and the width corresponds to the total number of
cases in each level. Waxweiler and associates de-
scribe an injury pyramid for TBI in which the tip
represents mortality (before and after hospital ad-
mission), the mid-portion contains cases for which
medical care was sought (including hospital ad-
missions), and the base corresponds to those per-
sons suffering disability from TBI without consult-
ing a physician.4 Sosin et al. amend this concept
by noting that the NHIS revealed that more per-
sons suffering head injuries sought medical atten-
tion than did not.7 Whether or not the burden of
TBI is pyramidal, the visual concept is useful in
describing the medical care provided to those suf-
fering the injury. Our study serves to further de-
fine the mid-portion of this injury construct, de-
scribing those who seek medical care in EDs
following TBI. Using Waxweiler et al.'s estimate
that TBI results in 51,600 deaths per year (1990
data) and the 1992­1994 NHAMCS data for those
patients suffering TBI who are either hospitalized
ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE · February 2000, Volume 7, Number 2 139
(231,471) or treated and released from EDs
(913,336), it appears that for every U.S. TBI fatal-
ity there are roughly 5 hospitalizations and 18 ED
visits. This does not include those patients either
seen in outpatient clinics or not medically evalu-
ated for their injuries.
National costs for head injury have been esti-
mated to be $54 billion annually in the United
States.14 The average estimated annual cost of
$346 million (1993 dollars) for TBI-related ED vis-
its is small in comparison, but it represents only
the initial charge for those hospitalized, and the
first payment for those who continue to require
outpatient services.
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE QUESTIONS
One of the problems found in TBI case ascertain-
ment is the fact that case definitions may lead to
the inclusion of those suffering only injury to the
skull (i.e., skull fracture) without intracranial or
neurologic damage. Likewise, if objective evidence
of TBI is not present, the diagnosis of TBI rests on
clinical judgment, which may vary by practitioner
and by patient report. The lower limit of TBI is
thus not clearly delineated by most case-finding
definitions. Following an impact to the head, one
may simply experience a brief episode of disorien-
tation or not be able to recall the specific details of
the incident to the clinician's satisfaction, in order
to be viewed as one of the ``traumatic brain-in-
jured.'' The 1995 CDC case definition of TBI is sus-
ceptible to the above concerns, and may not prove
to be representative of actual cases of TBI when it
is applied to an ED population of head-injured pa-
tients. In the present study more than half of the
cases were coded as ``intracranial injury of other or
unspecified nature.'' Examples of these cases might
include those with a clinical diagnosis of ``mild
closed head injury'' or ``head injury--possible con-
cussion,'' and it is unfortunate that limited diag-
nostic and prognostic information may be gleaned
from this classification. Patients who are hospital-
ized following head injury frequently receive more
specific diagnoses, and may be more appropriately
represented by the CDC case definition.
Several other limitations of the present study
deserve mention. Underascertainment of cases
was possible since a multiply injured patient may
not receive an initial ED diagnosis consistent with
TBI. The random hospital sampling design was not
structured to account for the location of trauma
centers, and this may have led to biased ascertain-
ment. The ED NHAMCS data set did not provide
the more precise and complete ICD-9-CM diagno-
ses typical of hospital discharge data, and this pre-
cluded accurate assignation of severity scores. The
data set provides no estimate of out-of-hospital
deaths, which are believed to account for up to 65%
of all TBIs, and thus does not quantify the most
severe injuries. Brain injuries sustained by fire-
arms are not described in the NHAMCS data sub-
set representing TBI due to their relatively rare
occurrence and the sample size of the survey, al-
though selection bias cannot be ruled out. Finally,
the database does not include fields pertaining to
restraints or other protective devices, and thus no
mention of their utility may be made.
It is reasonable to assume that the majority of
all TBI cases in the current study were of mild
severity, given that 80% of the patients were dis-
charged directly from the ED. The long-term se-
quelae of mild TBI have not been adequately char-
acterized in the literature and are worthy of
further study. Evidence from other studies sug-
gests that a clinically significant number of pa-
tients with mild TBI (up to 40%) remain impaired
from both a neuropsychological and an occupa-
tional standpoint up to at least one year post in-
jury.15,16 In addition to examining the long-term
sequelae of mild TBI, future research should de-
termine the effectiveness of preventive interven-
tions for TBI, examine the influences of managed
care and health care financing on the treatment of
TBI, and evaluate the impact of new therapeutic
modalities for those who have sustained TBI.
CONCLUSIONS
Traumatic injuries to the brain are commonplace
and their potential to cause prolonged impairment
is a source of concern for health care providers, the
injured, their family members, and the community
at large. This study corroborates prior research de-
fining the incidence of ED-treated TBI. While mo-
tor vehicle-related trauma represents the most im-
portant cause of fatal and severe TBI, other injury
mechanisms such as falls represent a significant
source of potential TBI-related disability. Young
children and the elders were found to be at signif-
icantly increased risk for ED-treated TBI, suggest-
ing the need to target these high-risk subgroups in
the population with prevention programs.

``The most important obstacle which had to be overcome in the developing of emer-
gency medicine as a specialty board was the perception of emergency medicine as
lacking in content and needing lengthy and unnecessary periods of training within
multiple other specialties.''
