Introduction
This article reports on some of the challenges and benefits of
international collaboration in conducting comparative quali-
tative research, drawing on our experience of working
together on a small exploratory study of two generations of
women in Britain and Hong Kong. Cross-national collabora-
tive research is now common in Europe, a product of
European funding, but it is far rarer to find qualitative, cross-
cultural studies of societies that are geographically and cul-
turally more distant from each other. Moreover, texts dealing
with cross-cultural qualitative fieldwork are generally based
on the premise of a researcher from one culture (usually from
rich countries or the global north) working in `other'cultures
(Cleary, 2013; Liamputtong, 2010) and therefore focus on
issues of cultural knowledge and sensitivity. Where collabo-
ration is mentioned, it is generally in terms of outsiders
working with local communities or local researchers (Cleary,
2013). Our study was not of this kind. We worked as an equal
partnership between two principal investigators, one Hong
Kong Chinese (Sik Ying Ho) and the other White British
(Stevi Jackson) and with the intention of comparing the lives

Abstract
This article explores the challenges and opportunities for methodological innovation arising from an exploratory, cross-
national, qualitative study of women's lives in Hong Kong and Britain. We begin by briefly outlining the aims of our study
and its original research design, based on life history interviews with young adult women and their mothers in each location.
We then turn to a discussion of how this was modified as we recruited participants and conducted the interviews, including
the use of vignettes. We aim to be transparent about some of the problems of implementing a symmetrical approach to
generating qualitative data in very different socio-cultural settings compounded by the practical difficulties of geographical
distance between team members. We argue for a flexible approach that takes account of local cultural sensibilities rather than
trying to follow rigidly identical procedures, recognising also that, in any qualitative research team, there will be differences
in approach that affect the data produced. We highlight some of the insights yielded by the problems we encountered and,
in particular, an accidental innovation that occurred through an ad hoc decision to conduct focus groups with the young
women, which we call `cross-cultural data feedback'. This innovation involved our participants in contributing to cross-
cultural comparison and also brought taken-for-granted assumptions in each setting into sharp relief, as well as sensitising
us to issues that proved important in analysing our data. This leads us to raise issues of interpreting and analysing data from
differing socio-cultural locations and translating between cultures. We conclude with some recommendations including the
potential for the future development of our method of cross-cultural data feedback.

2 Methodological Innovations
of Hong Kong Chinese and White British women, the major-
ity ethnicities in the two locations.1
As Ryan-Flood and Gill (2010) note, research `inevitably
presents dilemmas, challenges and choices, which are not
always explicated in writing up' (p. 2), when the messiness
and unpredictability of the process is often glossed over. Yet,
this very unpredictability can also, as we will show, create
opportunities for methodological innovation as well as unan-
ticipated insights into the lives of those we research. In this
article, we seek to make transparent some of the problems
and opportunities arising from working together as cross-
national collaborators, following the reflexive practice now
characteristic of feminist research (Letherby, 2003; Ryan-
Flood and Gill, 2010). After briefly introducing the aims of
our project, we will discuss the methods we used, focusing
on the ways in which the differing socio-economic and cul-
tural contexts in which we worked affected the recruitment
of participants and the conduct of in-depth interviews and
focus groups. We highlight a methodological innovation we
developed by chance and deployed in the focus groups,
`cross-cultural data feedback'. This method, we argue, has
the virtue of bringing cultural similarities and differences
into sharp relief as well as enabling participants themselves
to be actively engaged in making cross-cultural comparisons.
It also has the potential to be further developed in new
research contexts. We also address some of the issues
involved in analysing our data, making sense of it in the light
of linguistic and cultural differences and in relation to condi-
tions of life in the two locations.
In the beginning: conceptualising and
planning our collaboration
Our study was framed as an exploration of the impact of
social change on women's personal lives and relationships,
funded by an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)
Hong Kong bilateral award.2 The impetus for this study was,
in part, a product of the rare opportunity afforded by this
bilateral scheme to apply for funding for cross-national
research. But we were not just opportunistic, we also had a
genuine intellectual interest in refocusing academic debates
beyond the parochially Western. While small in scale, we set
out to address major sociological issues; in particular, we
sought to challenge the Eurocentrism of debates on intimacy
and modernity.
Mainstream sociological propositions on the transforma-
tion of intimacy (Giddens, 1992) and the process of individu-
alization (Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 2002) have come
under extensive criticism in terms of their assumptions about
gender, sexuality and family relationships and the evidence
base for their propositions (e.g. Heaphy, 2007; Jamieson,
1999; Smart, 2007). These critiques, however, have largely
remained focused on Western contexts; Jamieson's (2011)
conceptualisation of practices of intimacy is a notable ­ and
welcome ­ exception. More generally, the theorisation of
modernity has been marked by its Western bias, and attempts
to remedy this have been found wanting (see Bhambra, 2007,
2014). Even those Asian scholars who have challenged uni-
versalising characterisations of modernity, such as Yan
(2009) and Chang (2010) have tended to take as given much
of the Western sociological narrative of the origins of moder-
nity (Jackson, 2015). While seeking to unsettle Eurocentrism,
our project was, paradoxically, developed as a response to
debates that are Eurocentric in origin. This is perhaps inevi-
table if the aim is to bring the terms of these debates into
question.
Hong Kong and the United Kingdom may seem strange
sites for comparison as one is a nation and the other is a
Special Administrative Region of China,3 and neither can be
considered representative of their geographical region
(Europe or East Asia). Although this particular comparative
case may be very specific, the historical relationship
between the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, as coloniser
and colonised, makes it of particular interest. Both are now
part of the rich, post-industrial global North, but British
colonialism has left its mark. The particular niche Hong
Kong occupied in the British Empire was associated with a
neglect of the local population.4 Up to the 1970s, Hong
Kong was characterised by `third world' levels of poverty
and, while it is now richer than the United Kingdom in terms
of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the policies of
both the colonial and current administrations have resulted
in a lack of welfare provision and a huge gulf between the
rich and poor (Goodstadt, 2013), forcing its inhabitants into
self-reliance in a climate of economic uncertainty. This has
had consequences for gendered divisions of labour and
practices of intimacy (see, for example, Lee, 2003). We saw
a comparison between women's lives in these two contexts
as offering us an opportunity to think about the gendered
consequences of social change in terms of the intersections
between local and global inequalities.
While addressing major sociological issues, the funding
available meant that our study would have to be modest in its
scope.5 We planned at the outset to interview 12 pairs of
young adult women and their mothers in each of the two
locations (48 individuals), using the two generations of
women as a proxy for change over time, and subsequently
conducted focus groups with some of the young women.
From the beginning, we recognised the importance of a sym-
metrical approach to avoid taking one location as the base-
line against which the other was assessed ­ in particular
treating Britain as the norm and Hong Kong as `other'. We
therefore planned to pose the same research questions and
use the same research instruments in both contexts while
being sensitive to the particularities of local social conditions
and cultural practices. To maximise the comparability of our
samples, we defined the characteristics of our desired partici-
pants to ensure as good a match as possible between the
British and Hong Kong women to be interviewed. We sought
young women who were adult but below the average age of
Jackson et al. 3
marriage in both locations and set the age limits as between
20 and 26years. Since we were interested in exploring issues
raised by debates around transformations of intimacy and
individualisation, we decided to recruit young women with
university level education, those who would have a greater
degree of choice in their styles of life than the less education-
ally privileged. We assumed that their mothers would have
more diverse backgrounds. Finally, because of the complex-
ity of comparing two locations and two generations, we
agreed that each sample should be culturally homogenous,
recruiting from the majority ethnic group in each place:
Chinese, Cantonese speaking-speaking Hong Kong women
and White British women.
The interview guide we prepared at the outset was devel-
oped by the two principal investigators (PIs) in face-to-face
meetings. It followed a life history format to lead participants
through the stages of their lives from childhood into adulthood
and, for the older women, marriage and parenthood, with a
focus on interpersonal relationships. We planned to phrase
questions to elicit narrative responses, encouraging women to
tell us about their lives and experiences, but we also built in a
series of prompts to ensure we covered similar ground if infor-
mation we wanted did not emerge spontaneously, for example,
asking about who lived with them at a given time or about rela-
tionships with particular others. Towards the end of the inter-
views, we added a few more direct questions to explore
women's understanding of the social changes they had lived
through and also deployed vignettes to explore issues that
might be difficult to address by other means. The guide was
designed, as is usual in qualitative research, to be flexible ena-
bling us to adapt to women's specific circumstances and to
vary questions in response to issues they raised, some of which
we expected to be culturally specific.
In designing both the guide and specific prompts, we
were, of course, aware that the flexibility of qualitative inter-
viewing means that no two interviews follow exactly the
same path, that interviews are interactional events and what
goes on within them depends on a variety of situational ele-
ments. This potential variability is increased in collaborative
research where more than one person is interviewing since
each researcher's conversational style is likely to affect their
interaction with participants. Additional issues arise in a
study such as ours, where different members of the team
were conducting interviews thousands of miles apart in dif-
ferent languages and different socio-cultural settings. There
is a delicate balance to be achieved in trying to ensure com-
parability of data while being sensitive to issues of eliciting
it where differing cultural sensibilities are at stake. The cost
and practicality of travelling between Hong Kong and the
United Kingdom, and therefore the limited opportunities we
had for face-to-face meetings, exacerbated the challenges
that geographical distance posed. Once fieldwork began, we
were effectively working in parallel in recruiting and inter-
viewing participants. While we kept in contact and discussed
progress through electronic media as we went along, each
team lacked detailed knowledge of the ways in which local
conditions were affecting the research practices of the other.
These factors did not become apparent to us until the full
team met face-to-face 6months into the fieldwork and about
halfway through the interviewing, which was also when the
first focus group was held.6
Parallel fieldwork, divergent practices:
recruitment and the conduct of
interviewing
Since we were recruiting a purposive sample with specific
age and educational requirements, and needed both the
daughters and mothers to agree to take part, finding partici-
pants was not straightforward.7 We were eventually able to
interview 14 young Hong Kong women and 12 of their moth-
ers and 13 young British women and 12 of their mothers (51
individuals in total). The additional young women were
those whose mothers had originally agreed to be interviewed
but who subsequently dropped out, meaning that we had to
seek additional participants to meet our target of 12 mother­
daughter pairs in each location. We employed two recruit-
ment strategies: advertising for participants with the
appropriate characteristics and seeking them through our
personal networks.8 The way this was accomplished differed
in the two locations and impacted on the process of inter-
viewing and, consequently, the data generated.
In Britain, most participants were recruited through
advertising in two university towns, one in Northern England
and one in the South. Personal networks ­ referrals from col-
leagues ­ resulted in the recruitment of four of the pairs. We
had expected that most of the first contacts would be with the
young women who would then approach their mothers; in
the event, as many mothers as daughters were our first point
of contact. In Hong Kong, on the other hand, all participants
were recruited through personal networks. There were good
cultural reasons for this: in East Asian societies, recruiting
through personal networks works far better than any other
method. It fits `somewhat more naturally with Confucian
mores and expectations than attempting to recruit unknown
individuals who lie outside networks' (Park and Lunt, 2015:
n.p.). It is thus difficult to induce people to participate in
qualitative research and to build rapport unless they are
introduced through a known and trusted intermediary; in
Chinese societies, this is related to the importance of per-
sonal connections, guanxi (see, for example, Liu, 2007). A
few of the families were already known to Sik Ying. Other
potential participants were recruited through introductions to
young women from graduate students and staff in Hong
Kong Universities. Once the young women agreed to be
interviewed, they approached their mothers who then met
Sik Ying in a social context to gain the degree of trust neces-
sary for the interview to proceed.
In the British case, even where personal contacts had
been used, the interviewer was unknown to the participants.
4 Methodological Innovations
The personal contacts were made through Stevi's networks,
while most of the interviews were conducted by Jin Nye.
The British women, once recruited, were quite happy to
spend a few hours discussing their lives with a total stranger,
which is not unusual in interviewing in Western contexts.
For Sik Ying, on the other hand, it was necessary to devote
considerable time to building relationships with the older
women; she spent extended periods interviewing them and
often became involved in their lives. The British interviews,
however, were generally concluded within 2
hours and did
not lead to ongoing relationships with participants. Because
of these differences, Jin Nye was able to keep more closely
to the agreed `script' of the interview guide than was possi-
ble for Sik Ying.
The original intention had been to interview mothers and
daughters separately. This was entirely feasible in Britain
as most daughters had separate residences from their moth-
ers; in the few cases where they lived together, there was
sufficient privacy to conduct separate interviews in partici-
pants' homes. In Hong Kong, this was rarely possible. In
the first place, the young Hong Kong women all lived with
their mothers. They could easily be interviewed separately
away from their homes, but once mothers were introduced
it would have been culturally very difficult, and indeed
impolite, to separate them from their daughters to interview
them and may have made them uncomfortable. Moreover,
Hong Kong apartments are very small, affording little pri-
vacy for separate interviews within domestic space. This
was only possible in a few cases when a research assistant
was able to work with Sik Ying conducting parallel inter-
views and where it became, in the context, socially appro-
priate and practically feasible to negotiate separate
interviewing. The lack of individual interviews does, of
course, raise questions about issues that the older women
may have been unwilling to discuss in their daughters'pres-
ence and therefore about the comparability of some of our
data. Moreover, since these were conversational interviews
taking place within domestic space, if daughters were pre-
sent they became actively involved in their mothers' inter-
views. There were, however, benefits to this situation, since
interactions between mothers and daughters were often
revealing. For example, Sik Ying was able to record an
altercation between Gabby and her mother, Ms Au,9 about
the reasons for the latter's failure to offer her any informa-
tion about sex. Ms Au said that she did not find it necessary
to discuss sex and contraception with her daughters as she
assumed that they would have learned it at schools and
through the Internet, but Gabby disagreed:
Gabby:
Schools would only teach you about menstruation but
nothing deeper for example, premarital sex, I'd want to
know more and ask you (mother) about that.
Ms Au: You can always go look up the Internet!
Gabby:
Going on Internet is not the same as hearing your
thoughts and opinion!
Ms Au:
How come such a highly educated person like you
would not even go look up these things on the Internet?
You should know better!
Such interchanges are very revealing of the dynamics of
mother­daughter interaction on potentially difficult issues,
but we do not have data of this kind from the British women.
A solution to lack of comparability of data that these differ-
ent interviewing strategies produced might have been to
interview British mothers and daughters together, but this
was not feasible. Not only were we unaware of this differ-
ence in our interviewing practices until we were halfway
through the process, but there would have also been practical
difficulties in conducting joint interviews in Britain. The
British mothers and daughters often lived considerable dis-
tances apart, so that Jin Nye was travelling all over England
and Wales to conduct interviews. It would therefore have
been difficult and expensive to arrange joint interviews, even
had we realised what was happening soon enough to change
our original plans.
In retrospect, we can see that what was happening was
that each set of interviews was proceeding on the basis of
local, taken-for-granted practices. As far as each of us was
concerned, we were following the agreed interview guide
and gathering the data we needed ­ and we did, despite our
differences, produce meaningful data, albeit under different
conditions. While we were unaware, for a time, of the extent
of the divergence in our approaches to interviewing, we did
anticipate from the outset differences in data generation aris-
ing from idiosyncrasies in personal interviewing styles and
the specificities of local social and cultural contexts. The
vignettes we introduced at the end of the interviews were
designed, in part, to introduce a degree of standardisation.
Even standardised research methods, however, may not work
in the same way in two places and this may tell us something
about adapting interviewing techniques to differing cultural
settings.10
Using vignettes
Vignettes, fictional scenarios that usually feature a problem
or dilemma facing an imaginary protagonist, have been used
in social research since the 1980s. They are designed to draw
participants into considering what someone would or should
do in the situation depicted. Instead of asking about attitudes
or beliefs in the abstract, vignettes supply contextual infor-
mation in the recognition that `meanings are social and
morality may be situationally specific' (Finch, 1987: 106).
They are also useful in asking about sensitive issues, ena-
bling participants to talk about an imaginary person and situ-
ation rather than their own lives. This was one reason that we
decided to use them to explore issues of unplanned preg-
nancy and lesbianism, which could be difficult issues for
some women, especially those from Hong Kong, to discuss
more directly. We kept our vignettes simple, confined to a
Jackson et al. 5
single set of circumstances combined with an open question.
Our vignettes ran as follows:
The unplanned pregnancy vignette: `Kate is a single woman in
her early 20s. She has a boyfriend and is embarking on a
promising career. Kate finds that she is pregnant'.
What are her options and what would you advise her to do?
The coming out vignette: `Claire is a 22year old lesbian who has
never come out to her mother. She decides the time is right to do
so because she has fallen in love and wants to introduce her
girlfriend to her mother'.
How do you think her mother would feel about this?
We had anticipated that Hong Kong and British women
would have different opinions on these issues, which was the
case. We have discussed this elsewhere (Jackson and Ho,
2014). What was less expected was a marked difference in
how each group of women responded. We hoped, and
expected, that the open-ended framing of the questions
accompanying our vignettes would prompt considerable dis-
cussion of the issues they raised. The Hong Kong women,
however, gave very brief, cut and dried responses. For exam-
ple, commenting on the `unplanned pregnancy' vignette Ms
Lee said that if her daughter were pregnant she would
encourage marriage: `if she loves the baby's father there's no
point in getting an abortion'. The lesbian vignette prompted
similarly minimal and often condemnatory statements. Elsie,
for example, said, `I would want her to have a normal mar-
ried life rather than an abnormal relationship'. The only
Hong Kong woman who gave a fuller account was a mother
who had faced just that situation and told of the struggle she
had to accept it.11 The British women, on the other hand,
engaged in extended discussions of each scenario in which
they weighed up possible alternatives and elaborated on their
own views of issues at stake. Here, for example, are extracts
from Susan's very lengthy and considered reflections on the
unplanned pregnancy vignette:
Well, her options are to have the baby, to have an abortion, um,
to um, if you're having the baby you'd have to consider what
childcare arrangements you were going to be making, is the
partner committed to a long term relationship with Kate and the
baby, those are all factors that have to be taken into account.
What sort of rights she has within her career if any, if she's
already got maternity rights [...] she'd have to talk with her
partner and try and establish what his commitment to the baby
was, then think about what she really wanted herself because it's
a decision that will affect the rest of her life no matter which way
she takes it. [...] I think you just have to say well, other people
that love you will support you whatever decision you make, but
only you can make that decision. (Susan, British mother)
Generally, the British responses would be seen as pro-
ducing `richer' data and the brevity of the Hong Kong
responses would be seen as disappointing. These differ-
ences, however, might be telling us something. We do not
think that vignettes are inappropriate to Asian contexts as
others have used them successfully on a range of issues
(e.g. Kojima, 2013; Liu, 2007). It could be that this reti-
cence on issues concerning sexuality is particular to Hong
Kong women but this is unlikely as they did discuss some
related moral issues both in interviews and the focus group
we conducted with the young women (see Jackson and Ho,
2014).12 The difference could also be simply a chance effect
of different interviewing styles. The vignettes were pre-
sented verbally in the course of the interviews rather than
being written on cards. The issue of how they should be
rendered in Cantonese was not discussed in advance, so it is
possible that translation issues may have exacerbated any
difference in approaches to interviewing. It was only when
we came to analysing our data that we gave translation the
attention it deserved.13
Having discussed these issues among ourselves, and tak-
ing account of what our data has revealed about the lives of
our two samples, the most plausible explanation for the dif-
fering responses to the vignettes is what we have elsewhere
identified as the pragmatism of Hong Kong women, arising
from the material conditions of their lives (Jackson et al.,
2013). In the case of the unplanned pregnancy, the issue was
cut and dried to them because the options are limited and
these limitations are related to the wider social context. The
British women, however, were able to engage in lengthy con-
sidered weighing up of possibilities because there are more
choices realistically open to young British women in Britain
than in Hong Kong. In the case of an unplanned pregnancy,
for example, British women have better employment rights,
there is a greater acceptance of single motherhood and
cohabitation as well as more social support for single moth-
ers. In Hong Kong, the only realistic choices are to marry or
have an abortion. For the Hong Kong women we inter-
viewed, there was simply nothing else to be said. Responses
to the coming out scenario may also reflect pragmatic atti-
tudes since life for lesbians and gay men is much tougher in
Hong Kong than the United Kingdom (Kong, 2011; Tang,
2013) and those lives remain largely hidden from the major-
ity of the population. Thus, not only would Hong Kong
women, particularly the mothers, see departure from the het-
erosexual norm as extremely difficult to deal with and threat-
ening to the material well-being of families, but they had few
experience of known lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender
(LGBT) people to draw on in responding to the scenario with
which they were presented. The only exception was the one
Hong Kong with an acknowledged lesbian daughter.
The situation for the British sample was different. They
inhabited a social milieu where sexual diversity had become,
in recent decades, much more widely accepted ­ a trend that
some of the British women mentioned in their responses.
Many referred to known lesbian and gay relatives, friends
and acquaintances. Even the one British mother with very
6 Methodological Innovations
negative attitudes to lesbianism and homosexuality, Patricia,
was able to draw on personal experiences of a gay cousin and
a friend with a lesbian daughter to modify her initial response.
Whereas she began by saying that the mother would be
`utterly devastated' by finding that her daughter was a les-
bian, she moved on to imagining her coming to terms with it.
Whereas Patricia could refer to knowledge of her own social
circle in making sense of the vignette, despite her conserva-
tive attitudes, most of the Hong Kong mothers had no such
knowledge or experience.
Responses to the `coming out' vignette differed in another
respect. Whereas the Hong Kong women focused only on the
issue of coping with a lesbian daughter, many of the British
women of both generations noticed a particular (and deliberate)
feature of the vignette ­ the relatively late age of coming out ­
and tended to see this as problematic, indicating a strained rela-
tionship or a prejudiced mother. Some also suggested that the
mother would be hurt by the daughter's past failure to confide
in her. For example, Lucy, one of the young British women,
opened her response to the vignette by saying `If I was her
mother, I'd be really upset that my daughter hadn't felt she
could come to me with something that affects her life so much'.
Even when the British women did not mention the age at com-
ing out spontaneously, the ways in which they discussed the
issue then enabled Jin Nye to follow up with simple questions
such as `how about her age?' This prompted further thoughts
on why the daughter had not come out to her mother earlier.
The responses given by the Hong Kong women, on the other
hand, worked to close off further discussion, making it difficult
for Sik Ying to probe further without disrupting the rapport she
had devoted so much time to fostering. This shutting down of
the topic may reflect the concern about `face'(mianzi) and fam-
ily reputation, which are still of paramount importance in Hong
Kong. Closing off options (in relation to both vignettes) could
thus have been a way of showing disapproval or possibly fear
of confronting the possibility of ever having to deal with such a
situation. Crucially, the differing ways women dealt with the
vignettes, we suggest, may reveal something about the social
context of their lives.
Cross-cultural data feedback: the focus
group experience
The interviews were initially expected to be our only means
of generating data and it was only when we were halfway
through the interviews that we decided to conduct two focus
groups with the young women, one in each location. The first
of these took place during a 6-day research team meeting in
Hong Kong. Sik Ying had organised this in advance of the
Stevi's and Jin Nye's arrival, thinking that it would be useful
for the British researchers to have a first-hand `feel' for the
lives of Hong Kong women. Unlike the Hong Kong inter-
views, which were conducted in Cantonese, the focus group
discussion took place in English ­ in which all the young
women, typically for those who are University educated,
were fluent. All three of us were present. Participants
included the young Hong Kong women who had already
been interviewed and a few we planned to interview later.
Some of them brought friends along, which resulted in a
rather larger group than had been anticipated but led to the
generation of interesting new data.
In keeping with our commitment to operationalising sym-
metrical methods in the two locations, we subsequently con-
ducted a similar focus group in Britain. Like the Hong Kong
focus group, the British one involved some of the daughters
from the sample and a few other young women of similar ages
and backgrounds ­ but for different reasons. In Britain, this
occurred because of the impracticability of bringing together a
geographically dispersed group, and we therefore invited the
young women local to us and recruited additional members.
In the focus groups, we experimented with a new tech-
nique, which proved to be very fruitful: discussing some of
our emergent findings, illustrated with data, from the other
location, enabling Hong Kong women to comment on
British women's accounts and vice versa. We are calling
this, for want of a better term `cross-cultural data feedback'.
This came about almost by chance. Stevi and Jin Nye had
brought transcripts of the British interviews with them to
Hong Kong and we all thought it would be interesting to
have the young Hong Kong women comment on some of the
accounts of their British contemporaries. Having done this
successfully in Hong Kong, we then made data from the
Hong Kong focus group available to the British one. The
effect of this process was to involve our participants in the
process of making cross-cultural comparisons. Not only did
it provoke lively discussion and interesting insights into per-
ceptions of cultural differences and similarities, but it also
brought into the open everyday assumptions about `the way
things are' in each setting that would otherwise not have
been made explicit and issues that might not otherwise have
emerged.14 It also alerted us to subjects we might explore
more fully in the interviews we had yet to conduct. Two of
the issues thus brought into sharp relief were modes of dis-
ciplining children and the regulation and monitoring of
young women's sexual conduct.
A strong theme that had emerged in the Hong Kong inter-
view data was the use of severe and systematic physical pun-
ishment to discipline children. This was not an issue that had
featured much in our British interviews. When it was men-
tioned at all, by either mothers or daughters, it was to refer to
the slapping of children as a very occasional, exceptional and
regrettable occurrence. In the Hong Kong focus group, the
issue of punishment was raised again. The consensus among
the young Hong Kong women was that subjecting children to
beatings was widespread and acceptable provided the pun-
ishment was just and delivered in the context of love.Angela,
for example, told us that she was regularly beaten with a
feather duster, with her mother counting down `ten, nine ...',
but saying all the time `I love you'.15 Angela felt that this was
excessive ­ she would beat her own child `but five times
Jackson et al. 7
would be enough'. Donna also saw this as a necessary part of
child-rearing:
Although what I learnt at school [from her psychology degree]
teaches me that we should not physically punish the child, I still
think that it is necessary as the child needs to be afraid of the
parents to a certain extent. You can't spoil them too much!
(Donna)
When we shared this with the British group, only one par-
ticipant mentioned physical punishment, and all agreed that
control through guilt was a more common and effective
parental strategy:
Carla:
... but like the disappointment thing, that, `I'm very
disappointed in you', that was used a lot ... just anyone
telling you they're disappointed is horrible
All: yeah
Emily:
a positive thing as well, like my parents as well as doing
the whole disappointment thing and stuff they just sort
of show you examples of good behaviour as well like,
oh look at such, so she's really well behaved, so you'd
know what was expected, what you emulate as well as
what you shouldn't do, you'd have examples or like
stories in which, you know, the kid was really well
behaved and got reward or something like that, you
kind of got it engraved in you that way as well, it's good
to behave in this way, and if you behave in this way
then we'd be very disappointed
Stevi: so that disappointed really gets to you
Carla: mm, yeah it's horrible
Alexis:
still does now, if someone, if my dad says I'm really
disappointed, even now you feel really guilty, kind of
let you down
Further exploration of this issue in both sets of interviews
confirmed that this was a marked difference between our two
samples. This should not, however, be taken to mean that
guilt and shame were unimportant in the disciplining of
Hong Kong children ­ rather that they worked in conjunction
with corporal punishment, which could itself be experienced
as shaming.
Another major difference, on which we have reported
elsewhere (Jackson and Ho, 2014) was in mothers' manage-
ment of their daughters' sexual activity. The British mothers,
with one exception, accepted that their unmarried daughters
were sexually active and had been since their teens. The
Hong Kong mothers, on the other hand, assiduously policed
their daughters' conduct and constantly admonished them
against pre-marital virginity loss. This issue provoked
lengthy and lively discussions in the Hong Kong focus
group, which were then used as stimulus material for the
young British women ­ who were surprised and indeed
shocked that mothers could be so intrusive and that daugh-
ters could accept such restrictions. What became evident
here, which was nowhere made explicit in the interviews,
was how taken for granted it is that young British women,
from their teens onwards, will be heterosexually active. It is
not that the British mothers and daughters did not mention
parental regulation of sexuality ­ they did ­ but it was largely
in terms of mothers talking about keeping their daughters
safe (from unwanted pregnancy and coercive sex). This was
in keeping with the expectation that young women would
and did engage in a variety of sexual practices.
One aspect of this expectation was that it was common, in
the British families, for young women to have boyfriends stay-
ing over, and sharing their beds, in the parental home. We were
aware that this would be unusual in the Hong Kong context
and therefore asked the participants in the Hong Kong focus
group to comment on this. We used a data extract from an
interview with one of the British participants, Zoe, who com-
plained about an age restriction on her being able to sleep with
her boyfriend in the family home, which she had not been
allowed to do until she turned 18years ­ although her mother
had gone with her when she `went on the pill' a year earlier.
The reaction among the Hong Kong women was, universally,
that there was no way this would be possible for them even
currently, when they are in their twenties (Jackson and Ho,
2014). Using cross-cultural data feedback here also provided
an opportunity for cultural misunderstanding. Towards the end
of the discussion, the following sequence occurred:
Jacqueline:
but what kind of, I mean the background of family,
how is it like, this family?
Stevi:
um, it's sort of lower middle class, mother's a
teacher um, parents were um, quite hippy-ish in
their youth, so her mother's a bit sort of alternative,
if you like, she's still a bit of an aging hippy I guess,
in some ways
Jacqueline:
and then the house, they have space for them to
sleep together?
Stevi had interpreted the initial question as referring to
the attitudes and lifestyle of the family, whereas what
Jacqueline was asking was whether they very wealthy to
have so much space at their disposal. In Hong Kong, because
of the excessively high cost of housing, most people live in
very small apartments with limited opportunities for privacy
­ something we went on to discuss. This interchange, while
producing a passing sense of embarrassment at her own cul-
tural insensitivity on Stevi's part (since she was well aware
of the housing situation in Hong Kong) also alerted us to
something that was to become central to our analysis ­ the
importance of material factors in shaping personal lives and
relationships (Jackson and Ho, 2014; Jackson et al., 2013).
Analytical strategies ­ mapping and
discovering differences and similarities
We do not have the space here to discuss in detail our ana-
lytic strategies, but wish to highlight a few key points we
8 Methodological Innovations
consider important in comparative analysis. As is generally
the case in qualitative work, analysis is a complex iterative
process. We began developing a rough coding frame while
we were still interviewing, based both on our research
questions and themes emergent from the data ­ many of
which we had not expected. This enabled us to begin to map
generational and cross-cultural similarities and differences.
Both the coding frame and this mapping underwent con-
tinual modification and refinement with deeper exploration
of the data. At all stages of this process, consultation
between us was essential to ensure that we each understood
the other's perspective and were able to provide the context
necessary to make sense of the data from the differing loca-
tions.16 In interpreting the data, we consistently paid atten-
tion to the wider socio-economic, political and cultural
contexts of the women's lives. This is of vital importance in
avoiding the dangers of cultural essentialism (Narayan,
1998) and especially of any orientalist assumptions about
Chinese culture.
Here, we found Lynn Jamieson's (2011) concept of `prac-
tices of intimacy' particularly useful and has now become
central to our ongoing analysis; it has sensitised us to both
similarities and differences between Hong Kong and Britain
and enabled us to locate accounts of everyday practices in
their social context. Jamieson developed this concept, in
part, as a possible challenge to methodological nationalism,
suggesting that it could be applied cross-culturally. Practices
of intimacy, as Jamieson points out, are not necessarily egali-
tarian. A good example of this is parental disciplining of chil-
dren, where the concept of practices of intimacy enabled us
to see our data on this issue in a new light. While it may seem
odd to think of physical punishment as `intimacy', the Hong
Kong context alerted us to the possible legitimacy of doing
so; in both societies, parents `love and punish',17 albeit in
different ways. These may be two sides of the same coin and
therefore part of the practice of parent­child intimacy within
families. This might broaden ideas of intimacy in terms of
what goes in families and how managing children's behav-
iour relates to overall expectations of family practices and
responsibilities.
The differences between British and Hong Kong child-
rearing practices should not, we would argue, be analysed
as simply cultural, but as also a product of the socio-eco-
nomic conditions of mothers' lives and their daughters'
anticipated futures. There are parallels between the differ-
ences we found in our Hong Kong and British samples and
the class differences in mothers' regulation of daughters'
behaviour identified by Walkerdine and Lucy (1989). The
strictness of girls' upbringing in Hong Kong should be
seen in terms of their mothers preparing them to enter a
highly competitive educational and working environment
in a fiercely capitalist economy with almost nothing by
way of a welfare state. The mothers themselves had grown
up in the colonial era when conditions were even worse
and life was a struggle for survival; often, their own
education had been sacrificed so that they could contribute
to the family economy (cf. Salaff, 1995). They therefore
imposed rigid boundaries on their daughters' conduct to
ensure the latter's future success. The British mothers,
having grown up with the establishment of the welfare
state and benefitted from the expansion of educational
opportunities, could more often afford to be, in one wom-
an's words, `relaxed' in their approach to rearing their
daughters. Although they were concerned about the uncer-
tainties of the future for their daughters, they did not push
them to succeed in the same way as the Hong Kong moth-
ers did (see Jackson et al., 2013).
We make these points here to underline how, in a variety
of ways, the material socio-economic contexts of life have
been woven into the analysis of our data, including taking
account of the intertwined histories of Hong Kong and the
United Kingdom and the lasting legacies of colonialism and
how these histories have influenced practices of intimacy.
This does not mean that cultural differences are irrelevant,
merely that cultural traditions should not be understood in
isolation as definitive of how a given population behaves.
One significant aspect of culture that had major conse-
quences for our research is language.
The issue of language further complicated the analytic
process given that the interviews were conducted in the
native language of participants and that, while Sik Ying is
fluent in English, Stevi does not speak Cantonese or read
Chinese. It is vitally important, however, that transcription
and data analysis are conducted in the original language.
Language matters, as there are often not direct translations of
culturally specific terms so that translating our Chinese tran-
scripts into English prior to analysis would have risked not
only a loss of nuance but also possible distortion of meaning.
Even those who are bilingual can find modes of expression
delimited by the language they are speaking at any given
time. In one of our examples of physical punishment,
Angela's story involved her translating her mother's words
as `I love you'. These words served as a `free translation'and
make perfect sense to an Anglophone audience, but, as a
Cantonese speaker would immediately recognise, are
unlikely to be a literal translation. The word `love' in
Cantonese (and also in Putonghua/Mandarin) is `ai' but is
rarely used in a familial context among Hong Kong people as
it is too strong a word. It is more likely that Angela's mother
used the common phrase `ngo ho sek nei', which would
translate as `I really care about you'­ this would have been a
rather long-winded expression to use in English and her
choice of translation was thus a practical one, capturing a
degree of conceptual equivalence (Birbili, 2000), but losing
some of the cultural specificity.
Because we did not wish the subtleties of our participants'
words to be lost in translation, we did not work with transla-
tions of the Cantonese interviews. Instead, the Hong Kong
team provided the British team with summaries of the inter-
views. We then analysed the two data sets separately but to
Jackson et al. 9
our common, and continually evolving, coding frame, con-
stantly returning to the data and discussing it with each other
as we developed our analysis. It is only when we wish to
quote a participant that we then translate their words. When
we do this, we find ourselves having to make a choice, like
Angela, between a literal and freer translation, finding a
compromise that conveys a degree of conceptual equiva-
lence. Even where the literal meaning is directly translatable,
a literal translation can be baffling to a speaker of another
language. An example is provided by the way we dealt with
a Hong Kong mother, Ellen, talking about her daughter's
intention to buy her parents an apartment and expressing
belief in her daughter's ability to do so. Having said this she
commented, in literal translation `we should not look down
on our children'. While `look down on'is an expression used
in both Cantonese and English, to Stevi this sounded odd
applied to a person's children. In the initial published version
(Jackson et al., 2013), we settled on `underestimate'as a con-
ceptual equivalent, capturing what Ellen meant but perhaps,
in the process, losing some of the cultural specificity. We are
still arguing about this!
In other circumstances, the literal meaning actually helps
in arriving at an appropriate translation. Chinese is gram-
matically very different from European languages and is
written in characters, each one of which represents a concept
(which can also of course be spoken). One way of proceed-
ing, particularly with difficult to translate passages of tran-
script, is to think what each character denotes and connotes.
We found it useful to work together with the Chinese tran-
scripts, with Sik Ying providing first a rough translation of
the gist of the passage but then focusing down on the mean-
ing of each character and discussing the translation between
us ­ thus taking advantage of Sik Ying's native understand-
ing of Cantonese and Stevi's more in-depth understanding of
how varying possible translations are likely to be understood
by English speakers. These issues of translation continue to
be discussed between us as we carry out further analysis on
and writing from our data.
Conclusion
Interviews and focus groups can never provide a transparent
window into people's lives; they are products of interaction
that have occurred at a particular time and place, and the
resultant data are co-produced by researchers and partici-
pants within those spatial and temporal limits. The signifi-
cance of this in relation to the project we have been discussing
has become particularly clear to us because of events that
occurred in Hong Kong after we had completed our empiri-
cal work. If we were doing this research now, after the
Umbrella Movement18 occupations and its subsequent reper-
cussion on Hong Kong residents, where political divisions
and polarisation are often manifested within families, espe-
cially between generations, we would doubtless have elicited
different stories.19
This was exploratory research based on small samples,
but we have learned great deal from it, not simply about
women's lives in different places but also how to do research
of this kind. Research is rarely `a straightforward, clinical,
easily manageable process' but `inevitably presents numer-
ous challenges' (Ryan-Flood and Gill, 2010: 2). Cross-
national collaboration is even more challenging than research
conducted in a single location. It is clear, however, that the
difficulties and challenges we encountered were not merely
hurdles to be overcome, or differences in research practice to
be ironed out, but that they actually tell us something about
practices of intimacy in different socio-cultural contexts. In
particular, our experience indicates that while standardisa-
tion of research practices might be seen as essential to pro-
ducing comparable data, it might also lead to a flattening out
of meaning and context, and therefore the loss of important
insights. In working collaboratively, there must be room for
researchers to modify their practices in response to local con-
ditions and cultural sensitivities and also to experiment and
innovate ­ above all to be flexible and not to insist on apply-
ing western research protocols to settings where they are
inappropriate.
It was this flexibility and willingness to experiment
which led to the development of a useful innovative
method ­ cross-cultural data feedback. We have learnt
from the experience of using this method in a rather ad hoc
way, as a result of serendipity, and are now beginning to
think about the ways in which the process could be
improved to benefit our own and others' future cross-cul-
tural research. First, planning it into the research design at
the outset would certainly help make it more systematic
and effective, with the proviso that it would still be neces-
sary to be open to adapting it along the way as unexpected
issues and data emerged. Second, it is particularly helpful
to videotape the focus group interaction to pick up non-
verbal responses to the shared data and also, potentially, to
play it back to groups from other locations. If different lan-
guages were in use, the videos could be subtitled. This
raises potential practical and ethical difficulties. The prac-
tical issues are ones of timing and asymmetry between
groups. The first group conducted would not, of course,
have another focus group to respond to, but could (as our
Hong Kong group did) respond to previously collected
interview data. It might then be possible to hold a second
round of more symmetrical focus groups in which videos
were exchanged between two (or among more) groups.
The ethical concerns relate to ensuring consent to being
videoed and the video's use with other participants, as well
as protecting anonymity. Our third recommendation is that
it would be beneficial for researchers from differing loca-
tions to all be present at each focus group, both to feed into
it and observe. These are ideas with which we are working
in developing the future collaborations, but there may be
other ways in which this useful method could be further
developed and modified by us and other researchers.

Funding
The project was funded by an ESRC Hong Kong Bilateral award.
Notes
 1. We are not concerned with discussing our locations as `insider'
or `outsider' in the two settings. This issue has been much
discussed in the literature, including the important point that
these are not stable or mutually exclusive (Letherby, 2003;
Liamputtong, 2010).
2. Award number RES-000-22-362. The Economic and Social
Research Council (ESRC) Hong Kong Bilateral programme is
jointly sponsored by the ESRC and the Hong Kong Research
Grants Council.
 3. While here we use `UK'in discussing the relationship between
the two territories, elsewhere we deliberately use `Britain'
and `British' since all the UK interviews were conducted in
England and Wales rather than in the United Kingdom as a
whole.
4. For more information on the colonial history and its legacy,
see Carroll (2005, 2007), Tsang (2004), Chiu and Lui (2009).
5. The British end of the funding was equivalent to an ESRC
small grant while the Hong Kong funding was considerably
less.
6. The British team consisted of the PI (Stevi) and a postdoc-
toral researcher (Jin Nye Na) who was employed on the project
on a half time basis for 17months ­ the maximum affordable
within the funding taking account of other expenses. As well
as conducting most of the British interviews and co-facilitating
both the Hong Kong and British focus groups, Jin Nye was
involved with the early stages of analysis and is co-author of
this and two other papers. The Hong Kong team at any one
time comprised the PI (Sik Ying) and a research assistant. The
Hong Kong funding was not sufficient to hire a postdoctoral
researcher. Instead, a series of short-term Research Assistants,
with undergraduate or masters level education, were employed
and were mostly involved in support tasks. Only one of these
research assistants (who joined the team towards the end of the
interviewing) conducted any interviews.
 7. We have discussed the issues raised in this section and the next
in greater detail elsewhere (Jackson et al., 2016).
 8. These methods of recruitment meant that our participants were
self-selecting, especially those who responded to advertise-
ments. Those who volunteered to participate are likely to be
a somewhat biased sample, for example, excluding families
where there were major conflicts between mothers and daugh-
ters or problems they might not wish to discuss with research-
ers ­ although we did document some troubled individual and
family histories. Some families approached through personal
networks did decline our invitation to participate.
 9. All names of participants are pseudonyms. In choosing pseu-
donyms, we followed the form of names used in the interviews.
Some of the Hong Kong mothers did not divulge their per-
sonal names (though all the British women did) and where this
was the case, we have used family names. In some previous
publications, we have used the title `Mrs' but this is not cul-
turally appropriate, hence the usage of `Ms' here. Chinese
women do not change their family name on marriage though
they might be referred to as the `wife of' someone, for exam-
ple, Wong tai or Wong tai. We have given the young Chinese
women, and the older women who did use personal names,
English pseudonyms as it is common practice for Hong Kong
women, especially younger women to have both English and
Chinese names and to use the former in everyday interaction
­ all the young women in our sample did.
10. We also tried using `personal community maps' (Spencer and
Pahl, 2006) as a way of capturing both the possible diver-
sity of family forms and personal relationships within our
samples and also differences between Hong Kong and British
patterns of relatedness ­ for example, the greater importance
accorded to extended family relationships in Hong Kong
(see, for example, Koo and Wong, 2009). While this tech-
nique worked well with British participants, it proved impos-
sible to use in Hong Kong and was quickly abandoned (see
Jackson et al., 2016).
11. There was one other Hong Kong woman with a lesbian daugh-
ter, but she did not acknowledge her daughter's sexuality.
12. For more details on the use of vignettes in Asian contexts, see
Jackson et al. (2016).
13. Because our interview guide was designed to be flexible, the pre-
cise wording of questions was likely to vary from one interview
to another. It was therefore not necessary to pay close attention to
precise translation ­ unlike survey research where translation of
questions is a critical issue (see Birbili, 2000). We discuss trans-
lation issues in more detail later, in the context of data analysis.
14. A film called Mom Matters has been made of the Hong Kong
focus group, with subtitles in Chinese. The film is available,
for use in educational contexts only, from Sik Ying Ho.
15. Angela was, of course, translating her mother's words into
English in telling her story. We recognise that the words she
chose might not ring true for a Cantonese speaker. See below.
16. By this stage, there were just two of us working on the data,
Stevi and Sik Ying, the two PIs.
17. Love and Punish is the title of a documentary film made by Sik
Ying featuring one of the mother­daughter pairs in our sample.
The film can be obtained from her, strictly for use only in edu-
cational contexts.
18. The Umbrella Movement was a mass protest in the form of
79days of occupation between 26 September and 15 December
2014 in three key locations in Hong Kong: Admiralty,
Causeway Bay and Mongkok. It was part of a wider, ongo-
ing, struggle for democracy and genuine universal suffrage in
Hong Kong and developed from the original `Occupy Central'
campaign against the decision of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress (NPCSC) not to allow a fully
democratic election of the Hong Kong Chief Executive in
2017. When the police used tear gas and pepper spray against
the demonstrators, they protected themselves with umbrellas
­ hence the `Umbrella Movement'.
19. This has become evident from our new study, currently in the
pilot phase, of the impact of the umbrella movement and its
aftermath on practices of intimacy. We have recorded new
strains in familial relationships, but also new forms of solidar-
ity and personal relationships and emerging politicised identi-
ties among the younger generation.

York, UK, Her research interests centre on the sociology of gender,
sexuality and intimate relationships. She is the author of a number
of books including Heterosexuality in Question (1999), co-author,
with Sue Scott of Theorizing Sexuality (2010) and, with Momin
Rahman, Gender and Sexuality: Sociological Approaches (2010).
She has also co-edited a number of collections including, with Sue
Scott, Gender: A Sociological Reader 2002) and with Liu Jieyu and
Woo Juhyun, East Asian Sexualities: Intimacy, Modernity and New
Sexual Cultures (2008). She has published numerous articles on
sexuality, family relationships and feminist sociological theory.
She has recently been working, with Petula Sik Ying Ho (HKU) on
cross-cultural studies of intimacy and on the consequences of Hong
Kong's political turbulence for personal relationships. She is is co-
editor of two new book series, Sexuality, Gender and Culture in
Asia (with Denise Tang and Olivia Khoo) for Palgrave Macmillan
and Gender and Sociology (with Sue Scott) for Policy Press.
Professor Ho is at the forefront of gender and sexuality, qualita-
