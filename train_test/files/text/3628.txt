Introduction
War, as an experience that directly or indirectly affects the
life of the members of the armed forces, is considered a pow-
erful source of stress and particularly of the post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). In the current global political cir-
cumstances, the risk of experiencing trauma by involvement
in combat and hostile environments is extremely high (Hoge
et al., 2004). According to the Institute of Medicine of the
National Academies, 13% to 20% out of 2.6 million U.S.
military servants have displayed potential post-traumatic
stress symptoms since 2001 (IOM, 2012). Different studies
have reported serious mental health consequences of geno-
cides and wars worldwide, affecting not only the civilian
population but veterans as well (Cardozo et al., 2004;
Dohrenwend et al., 2007; Dursa, Reinhard, Barth, &
Schneiderman, 2014; Pham, Weinstein, & Longman, 2004).
The Balkans was also affected by wars during the 1990s,
which caused mental health problems to the population in
general and to vulnerable groups, such as war veterans.
Indications of high level of post-traumatic stress and mental
problems in individuals of all age groups, who were directly
or indirectly involved in high emotional intensity events dur-
ing wars and genocides, were reported by Cardozo, Vergara,
Agani, and Gotway (2000), Cardozo et al. (2004), and Pham
et al. (2004). Nearly 16 years after the 1998-1999 war, which
had left a large part of the population with mood disorders
(47.6%) and anxiety (41.8%; Priebe et al., 2010), a number
of studies were conducted in Kosovo on post-traumatic stress
in war victims. Those studies were focused on hospitalized
persons (Ahern et al., 2004), relatives of the victims (Morina,
Rudari, Bleichhardt, & Prigerson, 2010), victims of torture
(Wang et al., 2012), refugees (Ai, Peterson, & Ubelhor,
2002), and adolescents (Gordon, Staples, Blyta, Bytyqi, &
Wilson, 2008).
In spite of all the studies on the recognition of mental
health problems, particularly PTSD, not much has been
understood about its correlation with variables associated
with the functioning of veterans. A good proportion of veter-
ans do not seek help, or are provided inadequate help (Hoge,
Riviere, Wilk, Herrell, & Weathers, 2014) for various

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
in Kosovo Veterans
Mimoza Shahini1 and Merita Shala2
Abstract
Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at veterans
8 years after war, to find out relation of PTSD with other demographic and health related variables and discover the impact
of depression and trauma on PTSD on 687 veterans from six municipalities in Kosovo. Method: Participants were 687 war
veterans selected from six regions of Kosovo during 2008. The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ-40), was administered
to measure PTSD and Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25) for depression and anxiety. Pearson chi-square, analysis
of variance (ANOVA), and multiple regressions were used to analyze the data. Results: Results indicated that 11.2 % of
veterans even 8 years after the war ended were suffering from PTSD. Six percent of veterans with PTSD did not seek medical
help. They reported to have had emotional problems and physical problems, but they did not seek medical help. The findings
suggest that self-medication may be one way of veterans dealing with PTSD symptoms. Veterans with PTSD symptoms were
more concerned with "family issues" than those without PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: The study found that 8 years after
the war the veterans of the war in Kosovo suffer PTSD symptoms and that a good number of them do not seek help for this
problem. The establishment of adequate services by the state would transform these veterans' dealing with PTSD not into a
moral challenge but into a fundamental right to equal and high-quality services.

reasons, which are important to understand to create a healthy
environment not only for their own functioning but also for
the functioning of their families.
The goals of this study were (a) to identify the prevalence
of PTSD in war veterans 8 years after the end of their service
and (b) to study the correlation between PTSD and a number
of variables associated with seeking medical help, their eco-
nomic and social status, and the influence of a number of
variables on PTSD.
Method
Participants
The participants in this study were selected from the list of
war veterans provided by the Association of War Veterans.
The war veterans were involved in the study during 2008
through a random selection from the list, involving six
regions, which geographically cover the whole territory of
Kosovo. Of the 1,000 veterans selected from the list, 687
completed the questionnaire (response rate 72.3 %); 97.7%
(n = 671) of them were male, while 2.3% (n = 16) were
female. Mean age of participants was 42 years (SD = 9).
Mean age of males was 42 years (SD = 9.1) and females was
36.2 years (SD = 5.5). For number of members living together
in the family, responses ranged from 1 to 37 people, with an
average of 7.8 (SD = 3.8). The response range for education
was 4 to 23 years of school, with an average of 11.8 (SD =
2.3). Only 16.3% of participants have more than 250 euro per
month, and the average number of children was 3.4 (SD =
1.9). Most of them (65.1%) were living in nuclear family and
34.9 % in extended family. Before the interview, the partici-
pants were read the letter of information and the informed
consent. Each participant was informed of the voluntary
nature of the study, their right to withdraw at any time, and
the confidentiality of their responses.
Instruments
For the purpose of this study, participants filled out a demo-
graphic questionnaire prepared from the main investigator
and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire-40 (HTQ) for mea-
suring PTSD. HTQ is a self-report questionnaire, which con-
sists of three sections. In the first section are 48 questions
related to the traumatic event(s) that veterans may have
experienced or witness during the war. This section of the
questionnaire was evaluated with "yes" and "no." The sec-
ond section has open-ended question asking for subjectivity
description of most traumatic experiences during the war.
The third section of the questionnaire has 40 questions and
refers to three main groups of symptoms associated with
PTSD: intrusion symptoms associated with the traumatic
event(s), persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the
traumatic event(s), and psychological hyper arousal. The
participants were asked to rate each item on a 4-point Likert
scale (1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = quite a bit, and 4 =
extremely). The first 16 items such as "recurrent thoughts or
memories of the most hurtful or terrifying events" or "feeling
as though the event is happening again" attempt to assess the
accepted symptoms of PTSD diagnosis and following 24
items assess the impact of the traumatic experiences. The
respondents with total PTSD score >2.5 were categories with
"positive PTSD" while those <2.5 in HTQ were the "nega-
tive PTSD" group. In this study, the HTQ was found to have
an internal consistency of .97(Cronbach's alpha).
This questionnaire has been adapted in Albanian language
and used in different studies in Kosovo (Gordon et al., 2008;
Halimi, Dragoti, Halimi, Sylejmani-Hulaj, & Jashari-
Ramadani, 2015; Lopes, Kaiser, Gotway, & Agani, 2003;
Lopes, Vergara, Agani, & Gotway, 2000; Nelson et al., 2004;
Redwood-Campbell et al., 2008; Wenzel et al., 2009).
The Hopkins Symptoms Checklist (HSCL-25) is a widely
used screening instrument designed to measure symptoms of
anxiety and depression. It consists of 25 items. The first part
is composed of 10 items that measure anxiety, and the second
part is composed of 15 items that measure depression. The
scale for each question includes four categories of response
(not at all = 1, a little = 2, quite a bit = 3 and extremely = 4.
Two scores are calculated separately, and the Total score
includes both subscales. The Cronbach's alpha for HSCL-25
for the Total score in this study was  = .956, for anxiety
subscale,  = .905, and for depression subscale,  = .933.
Data Analysis
Internal consistencies of the HTQ and HSCL-25 were exam-
ined using Cronbach's alphas. Pearson chi-square test was
used to explore the relation between PTSD and other vari-
ables in the study, whereas to find out the differences between
groups in several variables, the t test for independent groups
was used. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to
asses whether there were differences in the PTSD among
groups and multiple linear regressions to asses whether
depression and anxiety predict PTSD. The statistical package
used in the present study was SPSS Version 19.0.
Results
PTSD Scores and Its Correlation With Variables
Asking Medical Assistance, Self-Medication, Their
Concerns
The prevalence rate of PTSD in war veterans in Kosovo
using HTQ was found in 11.2% of the sample. For PTSD
scale, responses ranged from minimum of 40 to maximum of
152, with a mean of 64.9 (SD = 22.8).
To assess the relationship between PTSD and gender and
some variables related to health seeking issues, we used the
Pearson chi-square analyzes. The results for gender
and PTSD groups were not significant, 2(1, N = 687) = .02,
Shahini and Shala 3
p = .698. We found a significant relation between PTSD
groups and how much they have been "working in the last
week, 2(3, N = 687) = 31.7, p = .0001. There were more than
expected participants in the "not working" group and the
"positive PTSD" and fewer participants grouped into "full
time" and "positive PTSD." Also, a significant relation was
found between "are you using medication" and PTSD
groups, 2(1, N = 687) = 31.5, p = .00. There were more par-
ticipants into categories "yes" and "positive PTSD" than
expected, and less participants in categories "no" and "posi-
tive PTSD" than expected. A significant relation was found
between groups that "asked for medical assistance after the
war" and PTSD groups, 2(1, N = 687) = 31.5, p = .00. We
found that participants in categories "no" and "positive
PTSD" had less than expected participants. Chi-square
shows a significant relation between the reason of seeking
help and PTSD groups, 2(3, N = 687) = 21.4, p = .001.
Results show more than expected participants into groups
"emotional problems," "other," and "more than one prob-
lem" in "positive PTSD" compared with "negative PTSD."
Table 1 presents chi-square results for these variables.
Results show that 52.1% of veterans have asked for medi-
cal assistance, and the most prevalent problems were head-
ache (6.6%), rheumatic problems (6.3%), bodily pain (5.5%),
hypertension (3.9%), and back pain (2.9%). For emotional
problems, they reported only depression and anxiety.
Based on the results of the independent t test for PTSD
according to whether they were using medication without
subscription, we found significant differences t(667) = 11.1,
p < .001. Participants that responded "yes" had higher mean
scores in PTSD (M = 75.6, SD = 23.3) than those who
responded "no" (M = 57.2, SD = 19.2). Significant differ-
ences on PTSD mean scores were found in group that sought
medical assistance after war (M = 72, SD = 23.6), compared
with those group that did not seek medical assistance (M =
54.8, SD = 17.2), t(667) = 10.3, p < .0001.
ANOVA was conducted to asses whether there were dif-
ferences in the PTSD by "what is the most concern for you
now" as a fixed factor. Participants'percentage responses are
shown in Figure 1. The concerns were categorized into finan-
cial (M = 58.2, SD = 18.8), medical issues (M = 68.8, SD =
22.8), family issues (M = 79.2, SD = 25.9), political issues
(M = 61.4, SD = 18.5), others (M = 53.5, SD = 10.1), and
more than one (M = 71.7, SD = 25.1). The results were sig-
nificant, F(5, 649) = 15.8, p = .0001, 2 = .110, showing there
was an effect on concerns expressed by participants to PTSD.
Post hoc analyses using the Bonferroni procedure were con-
ducted to assess the differences between group concerns.
Significant differences were found between "family con-
cerns" with all other groups. Significant differences were
found between "political issues" with "more than one prob-
lem" (p < .001) but not with other groups such as "financial
issues" (p = .496), "other problems" (p = .337), and "medical
issues" (p = .170).
ANOVA (4 × 2) was used to explore effects of reasons for
seeking medical assistance and using medication without
prescription on PTSD. The effect of reasons for seeking help
was significant for PTSD, F(3, 380.) = 8.7, p < .001. In post
hoc analyses, the significant effect was found between "emo-
tional problems" and "physical problems" (p < .001) and
"other problems" group (p < .001). The highest scores were
in emotional problems (M = 88.7, SD = 28.1) and those with
more than one problem (M = 80.6, SD = 25.9). No interaction
effect was found between these two variables with PTSD,
F(3, 380) = .13, p < .938.
A Pearson correlation matrix was used among PTSD, age,
incomes, and education. It was shown in the scatterplot
matrix (Figure 2) that PTSD was significantly correlated
with these three variables. A weak negative correlation was
found between PTSD and incomes, r(687) = -.183, p <.001.
Participants with more scores in PTSD have fewer incomes.
When years of education increase, the scores in PTSD
decrease weakly, r(687) = -.104, p < .007. A weak positive
correlation was found between PTSD and the age of partici-
pants, r(687) = .121, p < .002. Scores in PTSD scale increase
weakly with the age of participants.
A multiple linear regression was conducted to asses
whether depression and anxiety predict PTSD. The results
were significant, F(2, 686) = 615.5, p < .0001, R2 = .64,
suggesting that depression and anxiety accounted for 64%
of the variance in PTSD. Both these factors were accounted
further. Depression was a significant predictor for PTSD,
with the value of B = 1.3, p < .001, suggesting that for every
one unit increase in depression, PTSD increases with 1.3.
Anxiety also was a significant predictor (B = 1.1, p < .001)
for PTSD.

Discussion
This study explored the prevalence of the PTSD in war vet-
erans in Kosovo. The study has found a prevalence of 11.2%
of veterans who had PTSD 8 years upon the end of the war.
These data are consistent with other studies that found a
prevalence of PTSD in veterans after the end of the war
(15.2%, Kulka et al., 1990; 10%, Dohrenwend et al., 2006;
16%, Hoge, Terhakopian, Castro, Messer, & Engel, 2007;
20.9%, O'Toole et al., 1996; 12%, Erbes, Westermeyer,
Engdahl, & Johnsen, 2007).
In addition, this study explored the differences in relation
to seeking medical help, self-medication, and their concerns
over various issues related to life in general in veterans with
positive symptoms versus those with negative symptoms. In
the group of participants with positive PTSD symptoms, 6%
of them did not seek medical help for their problems. These
data are consistent with the study carried out by Vaughan,
Schell, Tanielian, Jaycox, and Marshall (2014). But, at the
same time, our results are lower than the results obtained by
Hoge et al. (2004), which showed that only 23% to 40% of
returning veterans who were positive for a mental disorder
sought mental health care.
Many participants reported that they had emotional prob-
lems and more than one problem and that they did not seek
medical help. One of the reasons that could explain this
result may be the difficulties with accessing medical services
in Kosovo, as there are no institutions specialized for work-
ing with veterans, and the relatively high level of stigma.
Meanwhile, this leaves room for their self-medication. Our

results are consistent with other studies (Schell & Marshall,
2008), which found that barriers to care included, in rough
order, concerns about confidentiality and discrimination,
preferences for relying on family and friends, concerns about
the effectiveness or side effects of treatments, and logistics.
The study found that low income and low level of edu-
cation, although at moderate level, are related to the sever-
ity of PTSD. Income was also found to be a significant
predictor of PTSD. The study has shown that the veterans
in Kosovo are a neglected category of the society, because
most of them live in less than optimal subsistence condi-
tions, which increases even more their reluctance to seek
help for their emotional problems. We assume that this
status of theirs is consistent with the results indicating that
their biggest concerns are family issues. Persons with
PTSD often have difficulties in establishing relationships
with family, which may affect both them and their fami-
lies and even more specifically their children, because
according to Dekel and Goldblatt (2008), clinical observa-
tions and empirical research have shown that the conse-
quences of traumatic events are not limited to the persons
immediately exposed to the event and that they often
affect significant others in their environment, such as fam-
ily members. Herzog, Everson, and Whitworth (2011)
found that family members of combat exposed soldiers
with high levels of PTSD are at risk for developing sec-
ondary traumatic stress. Many studies have reported fam-
ily problems among veterans, including emotional
problems and behavior problems with their spouse and
children (Ahmadzadeh & Malekian, 2004; Caselli, 1995;
Klari, Kvesi, Mandi, Petrov, & Franciskovi, 2013).
According to Braga, Mello, and Fiks (2012), the model of
transmitting trauma from one generation to another does
not consist of only traumatic experiences but also resil-
ience patterns that can be transmitted to and developed by
the second generation.
Conclusion
The study has found that 8 years after the end of the war,
veterans in Kosovo suffer from post-traumatic stress symp-
toms and that a good proportion of them do not seek help
for this problem. The economic status appears to affect the
retention of PTSD symptoms, by transforming them into a
moral challenge for veterans, because of the lack of institu-
tional support for this population with high risk of develop-
ing mental health problems. Health policies of a country
should foresee specific services for veterans and war survi-
vors, an in particular for the families of veterans, to reduce
the stigma and ameliorate the impact of PTSD on their
lives. Studies continue to raise a "hopeful possibility that
PTSD may be reversible if patients can be helped to cope
with stresses in their current life" (Friedman, 2004, p. 76).
Therefore, the establishment of such services would trans-
form the veterans' dealing with PTSD from a moral
challenge into a fundamental right to equal and high-qual-
ity services.
