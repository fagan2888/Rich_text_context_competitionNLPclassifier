HYPERTENSION, dyslipidemia, and diabetes are estab-
lished risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD)
morbidity and mortality (1). Adults aged 65 and older are dis-
proportionately affected by these factors, and although they
make up only 12% of the total United States (U.S.) popula-
tion, they incur 62% of national health care expenses for heart
conditions (2,3). CVD risk reduction strategies among older
adults can lead to a decline in premature CVD morbidity and
mortality (4­7). However, the past decade has shown a gen-
eral increase in CVD risk factors in this population along with
suboptimal control rates. CVD mortality remains the number
one cause of death among adults aged 65 and older, account-
ing for 31% of all deaths in this age group in 2003 (8­11).
The prevalence and management (treatment and control) of
cardiovascular risk factors among elderly people aged 65 and
older has not been well described, yet this population will
nearly double from 37 million in 2005 to 72 million in 2030
(2,12) presenting challenges to the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services, which provides the primary health insur-
ance program, Medicare, to most of these adults. Knowledge
of the current magnitude of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and
diabetes in this population is important for health care resource
allocation, disease management, and education (13,14).
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) is a nationally representative survey of nonin-
stitutionalized adults providing data on a wide variety of
health conditions through in-person interviews at home, fol-
lowed by clinical examinations and laboratory tests in a mo-
bile examination center (15).
This study presents national-level data from the NHANES
1999­2004 to estimate the prevalence, awareness, pharmaco-
logic treatment, and control of hypertension, dyslipidemia,
and diabetes among adults 65 years of age and older. A num-
ber of publications have used the NHANES 2003­2004 data
to report on aspects of hypertension, high cholesterol, or dia-
betes in selected subpopulations; however, these have not
specifically addressed awareness, treatment, and control in
adults aged 65 and older (8,9,16­19). Our study updates the
current literature with analyses of these three cardiovascular
risk factors, combining the NHANES 2003­2004 with the
NHANES 1999­2002 data in order to present a more robust
sample. Prevalence estimates in this study are based on clini-
cal examination rather than self-reported data; therefore,
prevalence rates for each condition include diagnosed and
undiagnosed disease. We also present predictors of aware-
ness, treatment, and control for these three CVD risk factors.

Background. Adults aged 65 and older are disproportionately affected by hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes,
which are established risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although risk reduction strategies among older adults,
including control of CVD risk factors, can lead to a decline in premature CVD morbidity and mortality, the prevalence of
these risk factors has generally increased in the past decade among elders and risk factor control rates have been suboptimal.
We assess prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control rates among U.S. adults aged 65 and older with respect to hyperten-
sion, dyslipidemia, and diabetes and describe predictors associated with awareness and management of these factors.
Methods. Analysis of nationally representative data collected from adults aged 65 and older (n = 3,810) participating
in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999­2004.
Results. Women have a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension than men (76.6% vs 63.0%) and a significantly
lower rate of control when treated pharmacologically (42.9% vs 57.9%). Dyslipidemia prevalence is 60.3% overall, and
women are significantly more likely to be aware of their condition than men (71.1% vs 59.1%). Diabetes affects 21.2%
of older adults, and 50.9% of prevalent cases are treated pharmacologically. Goal attainment among those treated is
problematic for all three conditions--hypertension (48.8%), dyslipidemia (64.9%), and diabetes (50.4%). Having two or
more doctor visits annually is associated with goal attainment for dyslipidemia.
Conclusions. Knowledge of cardiovascular health in older adults and understanding gender gaps in awareness can
help physicians and policymakers improve disease management and patient education programs.

Methods
Study Population
We analyzed the sample of older adults (65 years of age
or older, n = 3,810) participating in NHANES 1999­2004,
a continuing statistical survey of the noninstitutionalized
civilian U.S. population, sponsored by the National Center
for Health Statistics. All study participants have blood pres-
sure measurements taken, whereas those in the NHANES
morning subset (n = 1,556) also have measurements taken
of fasting plasma glucose and lipids.
Study Definitions
In accordance withAmerican DiabetesAssociation criteria
for epidemiological studies (20), study participants were con-
sidered to have diabetes if they met one or more of the fol-
lowing conditions: their fasting plasma glucose level was
126 mg/dL, or they reported being told by a physician that
they had diabetes, or they were taking glucose-lowering med-
ications.Apersonwasconsidered"aware"ifhe/sheresponded
positively to the question, "Have you ever been told by a doc-
tor that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?" Study partici-
pants who reported taking insulin or oral hypoglycemic
agents were classified as "treated." A treated person was
considered "controlled" if HbA1c was less than 7%.
Hypertension was defined in accordance with the Sev-
enth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention,
Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pres-
sure (JNC 7) (7). A person was deemed to have hyperten-
sion if the NHANES examination indicated that, based on
the average of three measurements, the systolic blood pres-
sure (SBP) was 140 mm Hg, or the diastolic blood pres-
sure (DBP) was 90 mm Hg, or if he/she reported current
use of antihypertensive medication. Consequently, a person
who may have been informed that he/she had hypertension,
but who was not on medication and who tested normoten-
sive on the day of the examination was not classified as a
prevalent case of hypertension. A person with hypertension
according to the JNC 7 definition was considered "aware" if
he/she gave a positive response to the question, "Have you
ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that
you had hypertension, also called high blood pressure?" A
person with hypertension was classified as "treated" if he/
she reported taking antihypertensive medication at the time
of the survey. A treated person was considered "controlled"
if his/her average SBP was <140 mm Hg and average DBP
was <90 mm Hg.
Study participants were classified as having dyslipidemia
if their low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol exceeded
the appropriate risk-based threshold established by the Na-
tional Cholesterol Education Panel (NCEP) Adult Treat-
ment Panel III (ATP III) (4) or if they reported taking an
antihyperlipidemic drug at the time of the examination.
Similar to hypertension, this definition excludes persons
who report having previously been told that they had high
cholesterol but who test negative in NHANES and are not
on medication. A person with dyslipidemia according to the
ATP III definition was considered "aware" if he/she gave a
positive response to the question, "Have you ever been told
by a doctor or other health professional that your blood cho-
lesterol level was high?" Those who reported taking pre-
scribed medicine to lower their blood cholesterol were
considered "treated." A treated person was classified as
"controlled" if his/her LDL was lower than the appropriate
NCEP-ATP III goal.
Data Analysis
We applied survey weights to the NHANES 1999­2004
data to derive population estimates of the prevalence of dia-
betes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, as well as aware-
ness, treatment, and control rates of these conditions
among persons aged 65 or older. Calculations were

performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC, 2004), and standard errors and p values computed
using the procedure SURVEYFREQ, which takes into
account the effect on estimator variance attributable to the
complex NHANES multistage stratified cluster sample
design. To determine independent risk factors, multivariate
logistic regression models were estimated incorporating
covariates for sex, age, usual place of care, doctor visits in
past year, household income, living with spouse/partner,
and education level. The models were estimated using the
SAS SURVEYLOGISTIC procedure.
Results
Table 1 shows the characteristics of adults aged 65 and
older in the United States. Based on NHANES 1999­2004,
55.2% are 65­74 years old, more than half of all elders are
married or living with a partner, and virtually all older adults
are insured.
The overall prevalence of hypertension (Table 2) among
older adults is 70.8%, with prevalence increasing as age in-
creases. Women have a significantly higher prevalence of
hypertension than men (76.6% vs 63.0%) and a significantly
lower rate of control on treatment (42.9% vs 57.9%). At
54.0%, blood pressure control is higher among the youngest
old (age 65­74) compared with 41.7% and 44.6% in the two
older age groups (ages 75­84, 85), respectively. Overall,
42% of older adults have uncontrolled isolated systolic hy-
pertension (SBP 140 mm Hg and DBP <90 mm Hg [data
not shown]). Women have significantly higher levels than
men of isolated SBP 140 mm Hg and <160 mm Hg (28.6%
vs 22.1%, p <.0002) and of isolated SBP of 160 mm Hg or
greater (21.0% vs 10.1%, p < .0001). Isolated systolic hy-
pertension accounts for 88.4% of undiagnosed hypertension
among older adults.
Dyslipidemia prevalence (Table 2) is 60.3% overall.
Men are significantly less likely to be aware of their con-
dition than women (59.1% vs 71.1%), although both gen-
ders are equally likely to be treated (40.9% vs 45.1%).
The oldest old have a significantly lower prevalence, are
less aware, and have a lower treatment rate for dyslipi-
demia than the youngest old. Two thirds of all older adults
medically treated for dyslipidemia reach their LDL
cholesterol goal.

Diabetes (Table 2) affects 21.2% of adults 65 years of age
and older. The awareness rate for diabetes (71.4%) is driven
by a significantly higher awareness among women than
among men (78.5% vs 63.6%). Half of all prevalent diabe-
tes cases are treated pharmacologically, and only half of all
treated cases reach HbA1c goal attainment of <7%.
Predictors of Awareness, Treatment, and Control
Tables 3, 4, and 5 present the results of estimating sepa-
rate logistic regression models for the rates of awareness,
pharmacologictreatment,andcontrolofthethreeconditions,
adjusting for the effects of age, sex, education, number of
doctor visits, living arrangement, having a usual health care
provider and annual household income.
For elders with hypertension, higher age is associated
with lower rates of awareness (odds ratio [OR] = 0.71 [age
75­84] and 0.54 [age 85] vs age 65­74), treatment (OR =
0.70 [age 75­84] and 0.60 [age 85] vs age 65­74), and
control (OR = 0.59 [age 75­84] vs age 65­74). Among
those with dyslipidemia, the oldest (age 85) have signifi-
cantly lower rates of awareness and treatment (OR = 0.29
and 0.38 vs age 65­74, respectively). Although there are no
significant differences between the sexes in awareness or
treatment for hypertension, women on treatment are only
half as likely as men to have their blood pressure controlled
(OR = 0.51). Women are more likely than men to be aware
and treated for dyslipidemia (OR = 2.60 and 1.56, respec-
tively) and more likely to be aware of their diabetes (OR =
3.14). There are no significant associations between educa-
tion (high school or more) and awareness, treatment, or
control of hypertension and diabetes, however, education is
positively associated with awareness (OR = 1.39) and treat-
ment (OR = 1.62) of dyslipidemia. The number of doctor
visits in the past year is positively and strongly associated
with awareness and treatment of all three conditions. Liv-
ing arrangement (married/living with partner) is not associ-
ated with awareness, treatment, or control of any of the
conditions. Elders who have a usual health care provider
are far more likely than those who do not have a usual pro-
vider to be aware (OR = 2.87) and treated (OR = 5.10) for
their hypertension. Elders with low annual household in-
come (less than $15,000 in 2002 dollars) are much less
likely than those with income more than $45,000 to be

(OR = 0.36 and 0.39, respectively). Those in the middle-
income range of $15,000­$45,000 are less likely than per-
sons with household income more than $45,000 to be aware
of their diabetes (OR = 0.36).
Discussion
Using the combined NHANES 1999­2004 data, these
analyses provide up-to-date estimates of prevalence, aware-
ness, treatment, and control of hypertension, dyslipidemia,
and diabetes among adults aged 65 and older in the United
States. Our results are consistent with previous studies of
prevalence of these three cardiovascular risk factors in older
adults (8­10,16,17); expand the body of knowledge regard-
ing awareness, treatment, and control rates; and identify
gender disparities among the rates.
We found that older women are more likely than older
men to have hypertension, equally likely to be aware and
treated, but less likely to have their blood pressure con-
trolled on pharmacotherapy. Older women have a higher
prevalence than men of isolated systolic hypertension. Ap-
proximately half of all older adults treated for hypertension
achieve blood pressure control. This finding is consistent
with recent studies showing a positive trend of increasing
blood pressure control among older adults (age 60) in the
NHANES study population (18,21). The improvement in
control may be due, in part, to physician education and
changing practice patterns based on the JNC 7 guidelines
(7). Notwithstanding this success, in the present study,
women are only half as likely as men (after adjusting for
covariates) to attain blood pressure goal. A similar finding
for women (age 20) was reported in a previous NHANES
1999­2002 study of racial disparities in hypertension, after
adjusting for race (22), suggesting that additional blood
pressure control programs specifically targeted toward
women are warranted. The paradigm shift of the JNC em-
phasizing the importance of diagnosing and treating systolic
hypertension among older adults (23,24) further merits the
need for such gender-specific programs.
We found the prevalence of dyslipidemia to be similar by
gender, with women more likely to be aware and treated.
Although overall treatment is only 43%, there has been a
suggestive upward trend of pharmacological treatment for

dyslipidemia among older adults (age 60), based on esti-
mates from the NHANES data (16). This trend may be at-
tributed to some degree, to increasing adoption of the NCEP
guidelines (4). Control rates for dyslipidemia in this study
are similar by gender and by age groups.
Our study found that women with diabetes are more
likely than men to be aware of their condition and that only
50% of patients on pharmacotherapy are controlled
(HbA1c <7%). Other studies in various clinical settings
have documented poor diabetes control among the elderly
adults (25,26). This study provides newer evidence that
confirms the need for improved quality of care.
In our study, treatment and goal attainment rates for all
three conditions are suboptimal. Continued physician ef-
forts to improve treatment rates and successfully treat pa-
tients to goal are needed. Although our study shows that
increasing numbers of doctor visits are associated with
awareness and treatment for all three conditions, and with
goal attainment for dyslipidemia, the interpretation of this
finding is ambiguous. It may be that more frequent visits
provide added opportunity for physicians to detect and treat
undiagnosed disease, or the causality may be reversed, and
those who already are aware and/or treated make more vis-
its for the purpose of refilling prescriptions or monitoring
treatment effectiveness. The reasons for the visits cannot be
determined using the NHANES data.
An important national public health effort to reduce CVD
risk factor burden through the Healthy People 2010 has had
ongoing successes (16,27), and knowledge of our study's
findings on gender differences in awareness and control
may be useful to clinicians in the effort to improve out-
comes.
The strengths of this study include its population-based
sampling frame and the availability of clinical measurements
to determine undiagnosed and diagnosed disease prevalence
and to determine goal attainment.Additionally, using 6 years
of NHANES data provides a large sample and precise esti-
mates of conditions affecting older adults. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first study to use NHANES 1999­2004 to
report on the prevalence and management of CVD risk fac-
tors among adults 65 years and older. Such information may
be helpful to health care decision makers. A limitation in our
study is that physician-specific variables, such as practitioner
age, group practice size and setting (eg, university medical
center), and practice patterns are not available in NHANES.
It is also likely that we overestimated blood pressure control
rates. We used a blood pressure goal of <140/90 mm Hg for
adults with hypertension with and without diabetes, a method
that has been applied in other studies (8,9). The current blood
pressure goal for adults with hypertension and with diabetes
is <130/80 mm Hg (7). Applying this threshold to adults
with hypertension and with diabetes would result in a lower
estimate of blood pressure control (7,9).
Our study provides insight into a number of controllable
risk factors affecting the U.S. population of adults 65 years
and older. This population has a high prevalence of hyper-
tension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Women with hyperten-
sion are disproportionately affected by higher prevalence
and lower control rates than men. Women with dyslipidemia
or diabetes are more likely than men to be aware of their
condition. Understanding gaps in awareness can lead to im-
proved treatment rates. For all three conditions, improve-
ments in treatment and control rates are needed. In light of
the expected growth in this population, patient education
and targeted efforts to improve disease management are
clearly indicated.
