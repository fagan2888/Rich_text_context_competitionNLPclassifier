Abstract
Medicare Advantage (MA) has grown rapidly since the Affordable Care Act; nearly one-third of Medicare beneficiaries now
choose MA. An assessment of the comparative value of the 2 options is confounded by an apparent selection bias favoring
MA, as reflected in mortality differences. Previous assessments have been hampered by lack of access to claims diagnosis data
for the MA population. An indirect comparison of mortality as an outcome variable was conducted by modeling mortality
on a traditional fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare data set, applying the model to an MA data set, and then evaluating the ratio
of actual-to-predicted mortality in the MA data set. The mortality model adjusted for clinical conditions and demographic
factors. Model development considered the effect of potentially greater coding intensity in the MA population. Further
analysis calculated ratios for subpopulations. Predicted, risk-adjusted mortality was lower in the MA population than in FFS
Medicare. However, the ratio of actual-to-predicted mortality (0.80) suggested that the individuals in the MA data set were
less likely to die than would be predicted had those individuals been enrolled in FFS Medicare. Differences between actual and
predicted mortality were particularly pronounced in low income (dual eligibility), nonwhite race, high morbidity, and Health
Maintenance Organization (HMO) subgroups. After controlling for baseline clinical risk as represented by claims diagnosis data,
mortality differences favoring MA over FFS Medicare persisted, particularly in vulnerable subgroups and HMO plans. These
findings suggest that differences in morbidity do not fully explain differences in mortality between the 2 programs.

Original Research
Background
In 2015, 31% of current Medicare beneficiaries were
enrolled in a private managed care plan (MedicareAdvantage
[MA]) rather than the default option of federally adminis-
tered traditional fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare.1 The origi-
nal proponents of MAsaw the potential for improved quality
of care, which could lead to better health outcomes when
compared with those of FFS Medicare.2 However, the abil-
ity of MA to achieve these goals has not been fully demon-
strated. A recent systematic review published by the Kaiser
Family Foundation described the evidence regarding the
relative impact of MA on actual objective health outcomes
and mortality as outdated and characterized by insufficient
control for selection bias.3 Some studies comparing mortal-
ity and/or switching rates between MA and FFS Medicare
have concluded that differences suggest selection bias
favorable to MA, but authors have also acknowledged that
the lack of publicly available claims diagnosis data for the
MA population limits comparisons between the 2 popula-
tions. In other words, an adjustment for underlying morbid-
ity might improve comparisons of mortality between FFS
Medicare and MA.4-7
Only 1 comparison of FFS Medicare and MA published
since 2000 has addressed mortality differences with control
for selection bias due to differences in morbidity.8 This study
concluded that a favorable selection bias does not explain the
lower rates of mortality observed in MA. The study relied on

self-reported morbidity data collected through the 1996 and
1998 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey.
The present study compared mortality between the MA
population covered by Humana Inc, a large health and well-
ness company with more than 1.9 million MA enrollees as of
December 31, 2012, the end of the study period, and an FFS
Medicare sample with correction for selection bias through
adjustment for chronic conditions and demographic factors,
with consideration of the potential for bias due to greater
coding intensity in MA plans. Further analysis calculated
ratios for subgroups. The study builds on previous research
by conducting an evaluation from a recent time frame and
with adjustment for morbidity.
Methods
Modeling Design
An indirect comparison of mortality between MA and FFS
Medicare was conducted by modeling person-level mortality
on an FFS Medicare data set, applying the model to an MA
data set, and then evaluating the ratio of actual-to-predicted
mortality rates in the MA data set. The predicted MA mortal-
ity rate would represent the probability of mortality if the
individuals were enrolled in FFS Medicare, that is, the rate
that one would expect to observe if enrollment in MA had no
impact on mortality.
Data Source and Populations
The FFS Medicare data comprised 5% Limited Data Set
samples from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS),
which are randomly selected, for the years 2010-2012. These
samples represented 4
313
885 person-years. The MA data
came from the insurer for the years 2011-2013. The variables
used from the MA data set were equivalent to those available
in the FFS Medicare data set. The MA sample represented
5477976 person-years. Both data sets represented the most
recent data available at the time the study was initiated.
Mortality data were derived from CMS denominator files for
the FFS Medicare data set and from CMS Monthly
Membership Reports for the MA data set. Individuals with
end-stage renal disease (ESRD), non-US residence, Medicare
secondary coverage, a group Medicare plan, or recognizably
missing data were excluded.
As this study was conducted as part of the insurer's nor-
mal business operations, it did not meet the Department of
Health and Human Service's regulatory definition of research
under 45 Code of Federal Regulations 46.102(d), and thus
did not require institutional review board approval or a
Health Insurance Portability andAccountabilityAct (HIPAA)
exemption--either for analysis of the insurer's MA data or
for analysis of the CMS 5% Limited Dataset. The authors
have access to patient identifying information in the insurer's
MA claims and enrollment databases through the course of
their daily job responsibilities and have accessed such data to
complete this work. Corporate policy forbids analysts from
accessing more than the minimum protected health informa-
tion (PHI) data necessary to fulfill specific business needs.
Patient confidentiality is further protected by avoiding the
reporting of data for subgroups with 10 or fewer individuals.
The FFS data, provided in a CMS 5% Limited Dataset, were
de-identified. In addition, the data use agreement with CMS
additionally required that aggregate data be reported for no
fewer than 11 individuals.
Model Development and Analysis
In the first step, the FFS Medicare data set was partitioned
into 3 independent groups: a calibration (derivation) set
and 2 testing sets, designed to all be comparable with
respect to average calculated CMS risk score. The predic-
tor variables in CMS risk score models are Hierarchical
Condition Categories (HCCs), which are based on prior-
year claims and reflect diagnosis as well as severity, and
several demographic factors. The CMS model for the risk
score considered in this study was based on a set of 70
HCCs (see Table 1).
Next, a logistic regression model was designed, using
SAS Enterprise Guide 5.1, to define the probability of death
in a given year for the calibration group in the FFS Medicare
data set. Demographics, Medicare eligibility characteristics,
morbidity data (chronic conditions, CMS risk score, HCC
count), and prior-year claims dollars (as a proxy for health
risk) were considered for inclusion in the model as covariates
(predictor variables).
Each possible predictor variable was considered for its
potential to create bias in the model. As risk-adjusted pay-
ments create an incentive for MA plans to more completely
document beneficiary diagnoses than is typical in FFS
Medicare, inclusion of diagnosis-based variables as model
predictors might elevate predicted mortality in the MA data
set and thus artificially reduce the actual-to-predicted mor-
tality ratio, creating a bias in favor of MA. To reduce this
potential bias, CMS risk score was omitted from the list of
variables eligible for the model. However, a variable for an
individual's total number of HCCs (HCC count) remained
eligible for the model, as did several variables reflecting the
presence of chronic or acute conditions (see Table 1).
Variables for diabetes and renal disease were omitted because
of pending changes with respect to these disease areas in the
CMS HCC model.9 Next, a forward stepwise selection pro-
cess was used to determine which of the eligible variables
would be included in the final model. Each variable was
assessed for contribution to the overall model fit using the
residual chi-square test with a significance requirement of
P = .05. Of the variables considered, only heart arrhythmia
and panel year were omitted from the final model. In the
final model, each variable had a P value <.01 according to
the chi-square test.
Beveridge et al 3
A final sensitivity analysis was then conducted by assess-
ing the accuracy of models with different combinations of
variables. The final model with the retained condition vari-
ables plus HCC count had greater accuracy at the individual
level (80.2% concordance) than that of a model with the
chronic conditions only (78.7% concordance) and that of a
model with demographic variables only (71.2% concor-
dance). Furthermore, the actual-to-predicted ratio in the
model with condition variable plus HCC count was less
favorable to MA (ratio, 0.8042) than the model with demo-
graphics only (ratio, 0.7875). Thus, inclusion of the selected
morbidity measures actually yielded a more conservative
estimate of MA-FFS differences, despite potential coding
bias. The tau-c statistic for the final model was 0.809, which
signified a relatively strong association between predicted
and actual mortality rates.
Although prior-year claims dollars was considered as a
predictive variable, it was ruled out due to its potential as a
source of bias. While prior-year spending has been shown to
be a good predictor of morbidity, differences in spending
between MA and FFS Medicare would be confounded by
differences in reimbursement models, types of benefits, and
out-of-pocket spending caps.
After selection of the predictor variables, the model was fit
to the calibration group, which represented 1437937 person-
years for 2010-2012. The final set of predictor variables is pre-
sented in Table 1. The resulting odds ratios for the calibration
group are presented inTable S1 in the Supplementary Material.
When applied to the first FFS Medicare testing group,
the model produced an actual-to-predicted mortality ratio
of 1.0008. Out of the 1
437
880 individuals in the group,
predictions were off only by 49 deaths, producing a Z score
of 0.21. The actual-to-predicted ratios by subgroup (eg,
subgroups defined by HCC count or gender) were checked
to assure that the model maintained group-level accuracy
across the subgroups as well as for the overall testing group.
Ratios remained close to 1.00 (range, 0.9368-1.2017, with
the extremes being tied to relatively small subgroups), and
37 of 40 Z scores were within 2 standard deviations. Given
these indications of group-level accuracy in the first testing
group, the model was not tested in the second testing group.
A plot showing model accuracy at various levels of pre-
dicted mortality is included in Figure S1 in the
Supplementary Material. This revealed some bias for indi-
viduals at the highest level of predicted mortality, but with
a good model fit overall.
Finally, the resulting model was applied to the MA data
set to yield the expected mortality rate had the MA enroll-
ees been in FFS Medicare. Additional analysis was con-
ducted according to subgroups defined by gender, age,
race, dual eligibility in the prior year, HCC count, plan
type, duration of Medicare eligibility, and the basis of eli-
gibility for Medicare (age or disability). The statistical sig-
nificance of the difference between actual and predicted
mortality overall and within each subgroup was assessed
by Z scores.

Results
Study Population
The FFS Medicare calibration group and MA data set were
similar in mean age (71.5 and 71.1 years, respectively), gender
distribution (56% and 55% female), and clinical risk according
to mean HCC count (1.55 and 1.58). Both groups were pre-
dominately white (84.8% and 83.0%), but the FFS Medicare
group included fewer black participants (9.3% vs 12.2%) and
slightly more other nonwhite participants (5.5% vs 4.4%). FFS
Medicare participants were more likely to have dual eligibility
in the prior year (20.2% vs 14.7%). The MA population was
more heavily concentrated in the South (64% vs 40% of FFS
Medicare participants). More than 66% of MA participants
were in newer, non-HMO plan types. Population characteris-
tics are presented in Table S2 of the Supplementary Material.
Predicted Versus Actual Mortality in MA
When the mortality regression model was applied to the MA
data set, predicted mortality was 3.7%, whereas actual mortal-
ity was 2.9% (P < .001 for the difference). These results com-
pare with both a predicted and an actual rate of 4.3%
(2010-2012) in the FFS Medicare calibration group. The differ-
ence in predicted mortality between MA and FFS Medicare
(3.7% vs 4.3%) suggests that the MA members were healthier,
which could explain the lower actual mortality in the MA pop-
ulation versus FFS Medicare (2.9% vs 4.3%). Nevertheless, the
actual-to-predicted ratio for the MA data set was <1.00 (0.804;
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.801-0.808). In other words,
MA participants were less likely to die in a 1-year time frame
than would have been expected for individuals with a similar
risk profile enrolled in FFS Medicare. These results suggest
that factors other than demographics and morbidity are respon-
sible for mortality differences.
Demographic Subgroups
Actual-to-predicted mortality ratios were lower (more favor-
able to MA) in individuals above the age of 50 compared
with younger members and lower in women compared with
men, but ratios favored MA in both women and men. All
subgroups with known race had actual mortality rates that
were lower than predicted. Compared with the white sub-
group, nonwhite subgroups (black, other) exhibited consid-
erably lower actual-to-predicted ratios even though predicted
mortality was comparable between the black and white sub-
groups. The actual-to-predicted ratio was also lower in the
subgroup with dual eligibility in the prior year, compared
with other participants (see Table 2).
Beveridge et al 5
Morbidity Subgroups
The difference between actual and expected mortality was
more pronounced among those individuals with the highest
morbidity, as represented by number of HCCs. Members
without any HCCs had low and similar predicted and actual
mortality rates. As the number of HCCs increased, both
actual and predicted mortality increased, but actual mortality
increased more gradually so that the absolute difference
between them grew. Relative differences, expressed as
actual-to-predicted ratios, consistently favored MA in indi-
viduals with an HCC count 1 (see Figure 1).
Subgroups Defined by Plan Type and Eligibility
Characteristics
Individuals with Local Preferred Provider Organization (LPPO)
and Regional Preferred Provider Organization (RPPO) plan
types had the lowest actual and predicted mortality rates. Those
with an HMO plan had the highest predicted mortality but the
lowest actual-to-predicted ratio, suggesting that the greatest
effect relative to FFS Medicare occurred in HMO plans. The
Private Fee-For-Service (PFFS) subgroup showed the least dif-
ference between actual and predicted mortality. Actual-to-
predicted mortality ratios were lower in members who had been
eligible for Medicare for more than 1 year compared with mem-
bers who had become eligible in the current year. No difference
in actual-to-predicted mortality was shown between individuals
who qualified for Medicare because of disability and those who
qualified on the basis of age (see Table 3).
Post Hoc Analysis
As the analysis consistently showed lower than expected
mortality rates in the MA population, a post hoc analysis
was conducted to investigate participation in a relatively
new care management service as one possible driver of this
improvement. This holistic service is designed for individu-
als who not only have serious medical needs but who also
are expected to benefit from assistance with a range of other
needs. For the year 2013, the first year of the program with
substantial participation, members who were eligible and
participating in the program experienced a mortality rate
that was 3.1 percentage points lower than that for those who
were eligible but not participating (6.4% vs 9.5%), while
both groups had a similar predicted mortality rate (partici-
pating, 7.3%; not participating, 7.2%). The actual-to-pre-
dicted ratio for participants favored MA, but the ratio for
eligible nonparticipants did not, suggesting that the benefit
of MA for this subgroup was mediated through the care ser-
vice. However, these findings may reflect selection bias as
participation is voluntary, and these early findings may not
be replicated as the program matures. Furthermore, the
accuracy of the model in this subgroup with high morbidity
could not be tested during model development because there
was no way to identify a comparable subgroup in the FFS
Medicare data set.
Discussion
Actual mortality in the MA data set was less than risk-
adjusted, expected mortality, both overall and in most sub-
groups. Some of the largest differences between actual and
predicted mortality were observed in certain vulnerable sub-
groups defined by race or income, and in HMO plans as
opposed to PFFS or PPO plans. Although subject to the pos-
sibility of unmeasured confounders, these findings provide
an important contribution to the sparse body of literature
evaluating the relationship between MA participation and
mortality.

Findings in the Context of Other Research
Only 1 other study published since 2000 has compared gen-
eral mortality as an outcome measure between FFS Medicare
and MA.8 Dowd and colleagues found no difference in 2-year
mortality between FFS Medicare and MA HMOs when con-
sidering observed confounders. In contrast, the present study
suggested that MA is associated with lower adjusted mortal-
ity. Several aspects of the Dowd study and the present study
may explain the discordant findings (Dowd vs present study):
largely self-reported versus objective observed confounders,
1996-2000 versus 2010-2012 and 2011-2013 time frames,
sample size 15164 survey respondents versus 6913915 per-
son-years, all MA providers versus a single provider, and
exclusion versus inclusion of individuals in Medicare
because of disability and individuals eligible for Medicaid.
Some comparative studies have evaluated mortality pri-
marily as a baseline indicator of health status rather than as
an outcome. Krumholz et al found that the difference in mor-
tality rates between the fee-for service and MA populations
remained stable from 2003 through 2013, with a difference
(0.72-0.89 percentage point) favoring MA.5 This difference
compares with an unadjusted difference of 1.4%, also favor-
ing MA, in the present study. Song has shown that as MA
attracts a greater share of the market, the health status of MA
populations improves relative to FFS Medicare populations.7
The studies by Krumholz et al and Song suggest the possibil-
ity of a selection bias favoring MA, but in contrast to the
present study, neither adjusted for morbidity. The authors of
both studies noted that their analysis could not assess the
extent to which MA plans contribute to the health of their
members as opposed to attracting healthier members.
Unobserved Confounding and Other Factors
Affecting Mortality Differences
Between 2004 and 2007, CMS policy efforts sought to mini-
mize favorable selection in MA. To the extent that favorable
selection persists, it may have created bias in the present study
in favor of MA and thus reduced the actual-to-predicted mor-
tality ratio. One group investigating the impact of these policy
changes has concluded that although some selection bias favor-
ing MAplans remains, it has been substantially reduced.10-13 In
the present study, predicted mortality was indeed lower in the
MA population than in the FFS Medicare population, which
suggests that healthier individuals do tend to choose or remain
in MA. However, the actual-to-predicted mortality ratios sug-
gested that differences in baseline morbidity do not fully
explain mortality differences; that is, either program factors or
patient factors other than baseline chronic disease are likely
responsible for the observed findings favorable to MA.
Various aspects of MA plans may explain lower mortality
rates, such as the use of alternative payment models or empha-
sis on preventive care and disease management. In this study,
the greatest reduction from predicted mortality was in HMO
plans, which account for the majority of MA participants
across all contractors, suggesting that HMO plans are particu-
larly effective relative to the other plan types assessed.
However, as the HMO subgroup also had the highest pre-
dicted mortality, further study is needed to assess whether a
benefit was observed in this subgroup simply because MA is
particularly effective in less healthy individuals.
Alternatively, it is possible that the observation of lower
mortality rate in MA, even after correction for differences in
morbidity, reflects unmeasured patient factors that favor
MA. For example, individuals who choose or stay in MA
may have better lifestyle habits or health-seeking behaviors
that help them achieve better outcomes even when demo-
graphic and clinical factors put them at risk. Interestingly, an
additional analysis in the aforementioned study by Dowd
et al8 used novel statistical techniques to adjust for potential
unobserved as well as observed confounders and showed
2-year mortality to be lower in MA, whereas analysis based
only on observable confounders had shown no difference
between MA and FFS Medicare. Statistical significance

depended on how the variable representing geographic fixed
effects was defined. Dowd and colleagues described these
findings as evidence of a selection bias against MA.8 Other
examples of assessing the effect of unmeasured confounders
in comparisons of MA and FFS Medicare were not identified
in the literature.
Some research has suggested that mortality differences
between FFS Medicare and MA reflect the fact that switch-
ing from MA to FFS Medicare is more common than switch-
ing in the reverse direction among individuals in nursing
homes or inpatient facilities, that is, among individuals most
likely to die in the near term.4 The present study's findings
neither contradicted nor supported those findings but rather
showed that for a given MA panel, mortality was lower than
morbidity and demographic risk would predict.
Subgroups
Important findings from this study included evidence that MA
may be especially effective in addressing health care dispari-
ties in vulnerable subgroups: nonwhite groups and individu-
als with low income as reflected by dual eligibility. Previous
research has also suggested relatively greater MA benefits for
minorities.14,15 These findings are relevant in light of national
policy. The Healthy People Initiative of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has set a goal of elim-
inating health disparities by 2020 in groups that are disadvan-
taged due to factors such as race/ethnicity, socioeconomic
status, and disability.16 In keeping with these concerns, the
CMS Office of Minority Health recently released for the first
time MA quality data stratified by race/ethnicity.17
Limitations
Certain factors may detract from the comparability of the
MA and FFS Medicare data sets. The Northeast and the West
geographic regions were underrepresented in the MA study
population due to low membership in those areas, and the
FFS Medicare data set was not selected to match the geo-
graphic distribution of the MA population. However, a visual
inspection of state-specific actual mortality rates showed that
in both the FFS Medicare and MA data sets, states in the
Northeast and West regions were more likely to have rela-
tively lower mortality rates. Thus, any bias that might have
resulted from these geographic differences would likely have
increased the observed MA actual-to-predicted mortality
ratio, making results less favorable to MA. In addition, pre-
vious research has shown that when patients in FFS Medicare
moved to another hospital referral region, the increase in the
average number of diagnoses was considerably greater if
they moved to a region characterized by high-intensity prac-
tice patterns (reflected in utilization as well as coding).18 If
the 2 populations differed with respect to the mix of regions
with low-intensity and high-intensity practice patterns, irre-
spective of whether patients were in FFS Medicare or MA,
results could be biased in one direction or the other. The
3-year time frame differed by 1 year between the 2 data sets,
but the authors do not know of a reason this would have sub-
stantially altered results, given the stability of mortality rates
in both FFS Medicare and MA in recent years.5 Finally, dual
eligibility status represents a limited means of adjusting for
socioeconomic differences between the 2 populations.
Several limitations inherent to study design apply to this
work. First, as noted previously, unmeasured confounding
may have biased results. Second, some individuals in the MA
data set may not have been enrolled long enough for their
survival to be attributable to participation in the plan.
However, as the average tenure within any 1-year panel of
individuals in the insurer's MA plans is approximately 4
years, findings can reasonably be assumed to reflect an effect
of participation in MA. The analysis may in fact underesti-
mate the eventual benefit as the total cumulative enrollment,
over time, is substantially greater than 4 years for the MA
population evaluated by this study.
Claims data (whether from FFS Medicare or an MA plan)
are subject to missing values and incorrect coding, and the
FFS Medicare sample may have been more likely than the MA
data set to have missing morbidity data. The extent of this dis-
crepancy is unknown, but selection of predictor variables was
designed to minimize the difference and sensitivity testing,
using models with and without morbidity variables, suggested
that study results could not be fully attributed to coding bias.
The authors acknowledge that the results may not be gener-
alizable to MApopulations served by other insurers. However,
one advantage of the model derived from the CMS sample is
that it can be applied to other MA populations to generate
actual-to-predicted ratios specific to those populations.
Conclusion
Overall, this study showed an association between enrollment
in the insurer's MA plan and reduced mortality after adjust-
ment for demographics and morbidity. The differences
between actual and predicted mortality were particularly pro-
nounced in low income, nonwhite race, and HMO plan type
subgroups. These findings suggest that differences in morbid-
ity do not fully explain differences in mortality between the 2
programs. Findings should be interpreted with some caution
because of the previously acknowledged study limitations.
Additional research is needed to more directly assess the
effect of MA on mortality. Longitudinal cohort studies track-
ing concurrent MA and FFS Medicare groups for several
years are needed. The apparent greater effect of MA in sub-
populations with more chronic disease merits further explo-
ration to identify the operant factors. The impact of duration
of enrollment on mortality differences might also be explored
to better assess the plausibility of a causal relationship
between MA participation and reduced mortality. Methods
for assessing the effect of selection bias are needed. As the
present study applied to a single MA provider's population,
similar analyses in other MA populations are needed to help
establish the effect of MA enrollment.
