Abstract
Objective: This study aimed to assess the correlates and predictors of improvement in general
functioning of children and adolescents who are treated in the child and adolescent psychiatry
(CAMHS) inpatient unit.
Methods: Hospital records of 308 children and adolescents who were treated for at least 1 month
in the CAMHS inpatient unit from 2005­2016 were included. Associations with individual, familial,
and clinical variables and the difference in Children's Global Assessment Scale (ÁCGAS) scores at
admission and discharge were evaluated.
Results: Positive predictors of ÁCGAS were older age and lower CGAS scores at admission,
whereas high familial risk scores at admission and diagnosis of early-onset schizophrenia negatively
predicted ÁCGAS (B ¼ 0.698, p ¼ 0002; B ¼ À0.620, p < 0.001; B ¼ À0.842, p ¼ 0.002; B ¼
À9.184, p ¼ 0.000, respectively). Familial risk scores were significantly and negatively correlated
with ÁCGAS (p ¼ 0.004, Spearman's rho ¼ À0.2).
Conclusions: This study indicates that improvement in general functioning during inpatient
treatment in CAMHS is better at an older age and with lower general functioning at admission.
However, high familial risks and diagnosis of early-onset schizophrenia weakens this improvement.

results in long-lasting difficulties in various
functional areas.1 Most children and ado-
lescents with psychiatric problems do not
require inpatient treatment. However, those
who are at risk of harming themselves and
others and need to be closely monitored in
terms of clinical, familial and social issues
may require inpatient treatment.2,3 Many
studies from various countries and cultures
have indicated that child and adolescent
inpatient units are effective for treating
individuals with various psychiatric diag-
noses and conditions.4­8 Studies that inves-
tigated the factors that play a role in
effective psychiatric treatment of children
and adolescents defined the individual char-
acteristics of children, their parents and
family, severity of psychiatric symptoms,
psychiatric diagnosis, presence of comorbid-
ity and treatment method implemented,
along with the characteristics of the treat-
ment team as predictors of improvement.9­13
Although previous studies have investigated
the outcomes of inpatient treatment of chil-
dren and adolescents regarding improvement
of general functioning and the continuity
of this effect,8,14 factors affecting this
improvement have not been widely studied.
Therefore, this study aimed to assess the
correlates and predictors of improvement in
general functioning of children and adoles-
cents who are treated in the child and ado-
lescent psychiatry (CAMHS) inpatient unit.
Materials and methods
This study was approved by the Dokuz Eylul
University Medical Sciences Research Ethics
Committee.
Patients and procedure
All children and adolescents who received
treatment at Dokuz Eylul University in the
CAMHS inpatient unit from 2005­2016
were included in the study. This unit,
which is located in Izmir Turkey, was
founded in 2005. This unit has the capacity
to treat 15 children and adolescents at the
same time, with more beds for girls than
boys. As a member of the Quality Network
for Inpatient CAMHS (QNIC) since 2005,
which is an initiative of the Royal College of
Psychiatrist in the United Kingdom, this
unit provides milieu therapy in conjunction
with medical and other therapeutic inter-
ventions in accordance with the patients'
needs.
The inclusion criteria of the study were
at least 1 month of stay in the unit, receiving
at least one axis I diagnosis according to
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text
Revision (DSM-IV-TR),15 and being dis-
charged following planned procedures.
Additionally, those who had an increase in
the CGAS score at discharge compared with
admission were included.
Data were collected retrospectively from
the hospital records. Sociodemographic and
family variables, clinical diagnosis based on
DSM-IV-TR criteria and refined with the
consensus of the team members, the pres-
ence of comorbid psychiatric diagnosis and
the duration of treatment were noted on the
data collection sheet that was developed for
the purposes of this study. Additionally,
individual and familial risk scores, which
were routinely calculated at admission and
CGAS scores at admission and discharge
were recorded. The difference between
admission and discharge CGAS scores con-
stituted the ÁCGAS score.
Materials
Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS). The
CGAS is an adaptation of the Global
Assessment Scale and was designed to reflect
the level of functioning for a child or adoles-
cent during a specified time period.16
Clinicians evaluated the child's functionality
under 10 sections with values ranging from
1 to 100. Increasing scores indicate a better
Demirgoren et al. 1319
general functionality.16 Shaffer et al.16
adopted the Global Assessment Scale for
adults to be used for children and adolescents
and demonstrated that the CGAS is a useful
measure of overall severity of disturbance.
This scale was found to be reliable between
raters and across time with discriminant and
concurrent validity. The CGAS is widely
used in research from Turkey.7,8,14
Individual and familial risk assessment. Risk
assessment was performed by risk evalu-
ation forms that were developed by the
inpatient unit in accordance with the
QNIC norms. They were routinely applied
to all patients at admission. The individual
risk assessment included a history of violent
behaviour, using sharp objects and/or a
weapon, threatening behaviour, destroying/
harming property, hurting animals, illegal
behaviour/punishment, self-harm, suicidal
thoughts/attempts recently, using alcohol/
substances, abuse (emotional, physical,
sexual), inappropriate sexual behaviour,
and the presence of any physical disability.
The total risk score was calculated out of 12
and higher scores indicated higher risks.
Family risk assessment included items
inquiring about insufficient supervision at
home, conflicts in the family, a lack of
cooperation with school, unemployment/
poverty in the family, a history of psychi-
atric disorder, self-harm/suicide in the
family, a lack of social support and the
presence of unemployment/poverty in the
environment of the family. The total risk
score was calculated out of 8 and higher
scores indicated higher risks.
Statistical analysis
SPSS Windows 22.0 packaged software was
used for analysis.17 In addition to descriptive
analysis of data, Spearman's correlation was
used to investigate the correlation of descrip-
tive variables with the ÁCGAS. A multi-
variate linear regression model was used
with the ÁCGAS as the dependent variable
to further clarify the predictive effects of
various factors. A p value 0.05 was con-
sidered to be significant in all analyses.
Results
During 10 years, a total of 308 patients met
the inclusion criteria of duration of hospi-
talization and process of planned discharge.
Eighty-one patients were excluded from the
study because of a shorter stay less than a
month and/or unplanned discharge. CGAS
values of 17 of the included patients could
not be found in the hospital records. Three
patients were excluded from the study
because they lacked any axis I diagnosis
according to DSM-IV-TR. Only one patient
had a negative ÁCGAS score at discharge
and he was excluded from the study.
Among the remaining 287 patients,
189 (65.9%) were girls and 98 (34.1%)
were boys. The mean Æ standard deviation
(SD) ages of children and adolescents
was 175.95 Æ 28.39 months (range, 77­215
months). The mean duration of hospitaliza-
tion was 85.5 Æ 31.3 days. DSM-IV-TR axis
I diagnoses of the patients are shown in
Table 1. We found that 181 (63.1%) of these
patients only had one axis I diagnosis and
106 (36.9%) of the patients had a comorbid
psychiatric diagnosis.
The mean CGAS score of the patients
was 37.8 Æ 10.18 at admission and 61.2 Æ
10.47 at discharge. Therefore, the mean
ÁCGAS score was 23.4 Æ 10.96. The indi-
vidual mean risk score at admission was
4.83 Æ 2.5 and the mean familial risk assess-
ment score was 3.80 Æ 1.96.
Correlation analysis
The ÁCGAS scores were significantly, nega-
tively and mildly correlated with familial
risk scores (p ¼ 0.004, r ¼ À0.2). No signifi-
cant correlation was found between the
other variables and the ÁCGAS score.

Multivariate linear regression analysis
Multivariate linear regression analysis was
conducted to assess variables that predict the
ÁCGAS (Table 2). Older age and lower CGAS
scores at admission predicted higher ÁCGAS
scores (B¼ 0.698, p¼ 0002; B¼À0.620,
p< 0.001, respectively). However, a high famil-
ial risk score and having the diagnosis of early-
onset schizophrenia were negative predictors
of the ÁCGAS (B¼À0.842, p¼ 0.002;
B¼ À9.184, p< 0.001, respectively).
Discussion
This study assessed factors that were asso-
ciated with improvement in general
functioning of children and adolescents
who were treated in the CAMHS inpatient
unit. We found that older age and lower
general functioning at admission were pre-
dictors of better improvement in terms of
general functionality. However, high famil-
ial risk factors and the diagnosis of early-
onset schizophrenia were associated with
lower gains in general functioning during
inpatient treatment of children and
adolescents.
Our finding that older age was associated
with better improvement in general func-
tioning during inpatient treatment of the
youth is in accordance with limited literature
on the outcomes of inpatient treatment at
this age.18 Setoya et al.18 showed that
response to treatment can be hampered
because of associated developmental issues
in younger children. Additionally, early-
onset psychopathologies in the child and
adolescent age group generally have a worse
outcome, whereas later onset is associated
with a better course. Therefore, older age
and a higher positive change in general
functioning in our sample is consistent
with the existing data.18­21
An interesting finding of this study is that
low-functioning individuals benefited more
in terms of their general functioning during
inpatient treatment. Although this initially
appears contradictory, it is consistent with
studies from various cultures, which showed
that children and adolescents with a higher
loss of functionality benefit more from

hospitalization.18,22 Multidisciplinary and
multidimensional therapeutic interventions,
including educational, social, and medical,
as well as psychological support at the unit,
may aid severely affected children and ado-
lescents in improvement during inpatient
treatment.
Familial risk factors, not the individual
risks of the child and adolescent, predict a
worse improvement in general functioning
during inpatient treatment at this age.
Additionally, children of poorly functioning
families benefit less from psychiatric treat-
ment.23 Parental psychopathology and/or
high stress levels in the family are associated
with poor outcomes.24,25 Moreover, Blader
et al.26 showed that inappropriate attitudes
of parents, such as using strict disciplinary
methods, are among the factors predicting
rehospitalization in children and adolescents
after discharge from the inpatient service.
Our results and compatible data from the
literature emphasize the importance of work-
ing with the family in child and adolescent
inpatient units and outpatient follow-ups.
Similar to the study by Setoya et al.18, our
results showed that diagnosis of early-onset
schizophrenia was associated with less
improvement in general functioning during
inpatient psychiatric treatment of children
and adolescents. Early-onset schizophrenia is
a more severe variant of the adult-onset form,
which might be associated with poor quality
of life and long-term general functioning.
Although patients show improvement with
effective psychiatric treatment, the rate of
progress may not be more than that of other
psychopathologies in this age group.21,27
Our study has some limitations. Changes
in general functioning were assessed with the
CGAS, which is based on clinicians' evalu-
ations. Inclusion of instruments that deter-
mine the patients' and their parents' opinions
may provide more comprehensive data. The
single centre and retrospective design may be
other limitations of this study. Interpretation
of our data requires caution in this respect.
Despite the limitations of this study, this
study shows that age, level of functioning at
admission, familial risk factors and the
diagnosis of early onset-schizophrenia are
significant factors affecting the improvement
of general functionality during psychiatric
inpatient treatment of children and adoles-
cents. Further studies on additional factors
may help to enhance inpatient psychiatric
treatment of youth because failure to provide
appropriate treatment results in long-lasting
difficulties in various functional areas.
