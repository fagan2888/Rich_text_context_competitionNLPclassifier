Do poor elders ever really leave poverty? We explore the prevalence and nature of exits from
poverty among poor elders, with special attention to rural-urban differences in this regard.
Analyzing twenty years of data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that 40%
of poor elders leave poverty after one year. However, descriptive data suggest many of these
exits resulted from small increases in income that merely nudged elders over the poverty line.
Nonmetropolitan elders are less likely to exit poverty than their metropolitan counterparts,
and this disadvantage widened when statistical controls were applied in multivariate models.

The Escape From Poverty Among Rural
and Urban Elders1
Leif Jensen, PhD,23 and Diane K. Mclaughlin, PhD2,3
Popular and political discourse in the United
States sometimes conceptualizes poverty as a trap
from which escape is difficult, if not impossible. Pol-
icy prescriptions inevitably center on efforts to im-
prove the employability and employment prospects
of those at the bottom, and to reduce their barriers
to work. But what of the elderly poor? Work as a
means to exit poverty is unrealistic, if not impossi-
ble for many older Americans. Do elderly people
ever really leave poverty? If they do, what triggers
these exits from poverty? And, are the increases in
income associated with elders' exits from poverty
large enough to meaningfully improve their stan-
dard of living?
We use the 1988 wave of the Panel Study of In-
come Dynamics (PSID) to answer these questions
about whether and how older people exit poverty.
We provide descriptive information on elders'
poverty exits, document the income changes asso-
ciated with these exits, and estimate multivariate
discrete-time hazard models of exits from poverty
to identify factors associated with these poverty

transitions. In these comparisons, we focus on dif-
ferences in poverty exits between metropolitan
(metro) and nonmetropolitan (nonmetro) elders.
Prior research has shown that nonmetro elders ex-
perience a higher prevalence of poverty than metro
elders (Glasgow, 1988; McLaughlin & Holden, 1993;
McLaughlin & Jensen, 1993) and that they are more
likely to become poor in a given year than metro el-
ders (McLaughlin & Jensen, 1995). We suspect that
nonmetro elders will also have lower rates of exit
from poverty once they have become poor. In the
sections that follow, we outline possible explana-
tions for elders exiting poverty and extend these ex-
planations to suggest why nonmetro elders would
have less chance of exiting poverty.
What Explains Older People's Exits From Poverty?
A popular image holds that old age is a time of
economic vulnerability and an increasing risk of
sliding into poverty. Empirical evidence supports
this view. Among those aged 65 or older, the preva-
lence of poverty and the probability of making a
transition into poverty both increase substantially
with age (McLaughlin & Jensen, 1993,. 1995), and
events such as divorce, widowhood, retirement, un-
employment, and disability often are proximate de-
terminants of economic decline (Burkhauser &
Duncan, 1991). Underlying background factors that
condition poverty risks among elders are readily
derivable from theory (Glasgow, Holden, McLaugh-
lin, & Rowles, 1993). Stated simply, those who are
well endowed with human capital and who enjoyed
favorable employment circumstances throughout
their prime working years (as well as elderly per-
sons married to such individuals) will be better po-
sitioned to maintain their economic status into their
later years than those less fortunate (Campbell &
Henretta, 1980).
462 The Gerontologist
However, because elderly people, especially
those in their seventies, eighties, and beyond, often
cannot rely on labor force participation as a strategy
to boost income, and because they otherwise have
relatively fixed income sources, proximate events
and underlying circumstances that would presage
movements out of poverty are harder to identify.
Nonetheless, empirical evidence suggests there is
significant movement out of poverty among elders.
The Retirement History Survey (RHS) interviewed
household heads aged 58-63 in 1969 and re-inter-
viewed them at two-year intervals over the follow-
ing decade. Analyzing these longitudinal data,
Holden, Burkhauser, and Myers (1986) found that in
the 1970s, 80% of once-poor eventual widows, and
88% of once-poor intact couples were no longer in
poverty six years after the beginning of a poverty
spell. A poverty spell is a period of one or more
consecutive years during which an elderly person is
poor. Analyzing the 1970 to 1982 waves of the PSID,
Coe (1988) found that 42% of older people's poverty
spells had ended after one year. Thereafter, exit
probabilities dropped substantially, to 23 and 22%
for those who had spent two and three years in
poverty, respectively. Coe further documents that
while these duration-specific exit probabilities were
similar to those of the non-elderly population, exit
probabilities from longer poverty spells were much
lower for the elders than the non-elders. Studies
looking exclusively at poor widows, a particularly
vulnerable group, also suggest substantial move-
ment out of poverty. Bound, Duncan, Laren, and
Oleinick (1991) analyzed the 1968-1984 waves of the
PSID and established that at least 35% of poverty
spells that began after an elderly woman became
widowed had ended within five years. Using months
as discrete-time intervals, Dodge (1995) found in an
analysis of data from the Survey of Income and Pro-
gram Participation (SIPP) that of the 736 widows who
became poor in 1986 or 1987, 321 (43.6%) had exited
poverty within 21 months.
The simple point is that not only do poor elders
exit poverty, they do so with significant frequency.
Theoretical reasons for poverty exits can be found in
the array of current and background determinants of
elderly people's economic status generally. As noted
above, economic vulnerability increases substantially
with age, suggesting a negative effect of age on the
likelihood of making a transition out of poverty. The
ability to work, which is highly related to age, should
increase the probability of exiting poverty. Earnings
are the primary income source for those old people
who work (McLaughlin & Jensen, 1993). Elders who
are married may have less difficulty exiting poverty
than widows and other unmarried elders. Marriage
might allow more flexible income maintenance
strategies. Moreover, poor widows in these cohorts
seldom have access to a pension based on their own
work effort and often lose access to a spouse's pen-
sion once the spouse dies. These widows rely on rel-
atively fixed and sometimes insufficient Social Secu-
rity benefits. Empirical evidence supports the lower
poverty exit probabilities for elders who are older,
not working, and widowed (Dodge, 1995; Holden et
al., 1986).
Background factors are clearly important in deter-
mining which elders experience poverty, but they
also may condition the chances of poverty exit once
they become poor. Those who have had steady em-
ployment in reasonably well paying jobs, perhaps
with pension and health insurance coverage, will be
better able than others to escape poverty. Such
workers and their spouses also would tend to have
higher Social Security benefits (Himes & McLaughlin,
1994), which means that less supplemental income
may be necessary to bring them out of poverty. Con-
versely, those with spotty employment histories in
jobs offering low wages, little opportunity for up-
ward mobility, and no pension coverage will be at
higher risk of poverty throughout life. As such, they
would be less likely to have built the financial base
needed to move out of poverty in old age.
The Implications of Residence for Poverty Exits
We are particularly interested in the effects of
residence in nonmetro areas on the dynamics of
poverty in old age. As noted above, there is ample
evidence that nonmetro elders have a higher
poverty prevalence, and have a higher risk of falling
into poverty than their metro counterparts (Glas-
gow, 1988; McLaughlin & Holden, 1993; McLaughlin
& Jensen, 1993,1995). We expect this nonmetro dis-
advantage also will be manifest in lower probabili-
ties of poverty exit among nonmetro elders. This
residential difference may rest partly in well known
disadvantages in the employment backgrounds of
nonmetro elders. Nonmetro jobs are more likely to
be marginal and to offer subpoverty-level wages
(Lichter, Johnston, & McLaughlin, 1994; Seninger &
Smeeding, 1981); they are more prone to be sea-
sonal and unstable (Lucas, 1971; Tomaskovic-Devey,
1987); and they have lower returns to education
(McLaughlin & Perman, 1991), lower skill require-
ments, and fewer opportunities for advancement
(Doeringer, 1984; McCranahan, 1988). Nonmetro
workers are less likely to be unionized or to be cov-
ered by a pension plan (Erickson, 1981). Again, while
these disadvantages may place nonmetro elders at
greater risk of falling into poverty, they also may
conspire to produce circumstances that make it
more difficult for nonmetro elders to exit poverty.
Methods
We analyze data from the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics (PSID) which, since 1968, has been con-
ducted annually by the Survey Research Center at
the University of Michigan. With its roots in the War
on Poverty, the PSID contains a wide range of vari-
ables describing the social, demographic, and eco-
nomic circumstances of U.S. families, as well as ret-
rospective data on the employment histories of
family heads and their spouses. As such, the PSID is
uniquely well suited to study the changing socio-
economic circumstances of families in general and
Vol. 37, No. 4,1997 463
the dynamic nature of poverty among elderly peo-
ple in particular. The original sample of about 5,000
families contained a nationally representative sub-
set of about 3,000 families, and a subset of 2,000 low
income families. When sample weights are applied,
the PSID provides a nationally representative reflec-
tion of the nonimmigrant U.S. population (Becketti,
Gould, Lillard, & Welch, 1988). We analyze both the
response and nonresponse files of the 1988 wave of
the PSID. For those respondents who, because of
death or for other reasons, attrited from the sample,
the nonresponse file contains their data records up
to the year when they dropped out of the study
(Hill, 1992). Given the higher mortality rates of el-
ders, using the nonresponse file of the PSID pro-
vides a complete picture of the circumstances of
the elderly population, not just those who survived
until the 1988 interview.
From these PSID files we selected household
heads who were aged 55 or more at any time be-
tween 1968 and 1988. The analysis has three parts.
First, we analyze poverty spells to document
metro/nonmetro differences in the rate at which el-
ders exit poverty. Second, to determine whether el-
ders ever really leave poverty, we provide a detailed
analysis of changes in income that correspond with
transitions out of poverty. Finally,.to provide further
elaboration on residential differences in poverty
exits, we estimate discrete-time hazard models of
transitions out of poverty. Predictors in these mod-
els include current socioeconomic and demo-
graphic characteristics of household heads, as well
as measures of the employment history of heads.
To measure poverty, the official U.S. Census Bu-
reau definition is closely followed. Families or indi-
viduals are defined as poor if their annual cash in-
come is less than a threshold needed to provide for
basic needs. These thresholds are three times the
cost of a minimally adequate diet as set forth by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture's economy food
plan (Orshansky, 1965), and are adjusted for family
size and number of children present. They also are
slightly lower for one- and two-person families with
elderly heads, under the assumption that elders re-
quire less income to maintain a minimal existence.
The PSID treatment of the income-to-needs ratio
does not permit an exact replication of the U.S.
Census Bureau poverty definition, but the adjusted
PSID income-to-needs ratios used here are highly
comparable to the official Census Bureau ratios. In
the following analysis, a poverty exit occurs when
an individual's family income-to-needs ratio goes
from being less than one in the year(s) prior to a
given PSID, to being one or greater during that year.
Residence in metro or nonmetro counties is deter-
mined by the 1970 designation of metro counties. In
general, metro areas comprise a central county with
(a) at least one city of 50,000 residents, or (b) a total in
urbanized areas of at least 100,000 population. They
also include any satellite counties that are tied eco-
nomically to the central county. The use of the 1970
definition overstates the number of nonmetro elders
in later waves of the PSID by defining as nonmetro
elders residing in nonmetro counties that grew and
became classified as metropolitan after 1970. Resi-
dence status for individuals can change from year to
year. Other variables are described as they enter the
analysis.
Results
Residence Differences in Poverty Exits
Compared to metro elders, nonmetro elderly
people have a higher poverty prevalence (Glasgow,
1988) and a greater risk of falling into poverty over
time (McLaughlin & Jensen, 1995). Our first step in
this study was to establish whether nonmetro el-
ders are similarly disadvantaged when it comes to
escaping from poverty. The PSID data were first re-
configured into a person-year file in which poor
household heads contribute one year of data (and
one record in the person-year file) for each year
they were in poverty and thus potentially able to
exit poverty.
With this person-year file as the basis of our analy-
sis, Table 1 shows metro/nonmetro differences in
rates of exit from poverty conditioned on the num-
ber of years that elders were poor. Of the 738 non-
metro elders who were poor for one year, 277 (.375)
had escaped poverty after that first year. The corre-
sponding exit rate for metro elders was slightly
higher (.394). The exit rates drop off substantially
with the number of years spent in poverty, especially

in the first few duration categories, which simply re-
flects the fact that those who have been in poverty
for more years are more likely to be suffering from
deep poverty and to have those characteristics that
make escape from poverty more difficult. At the ex-
treme, the annual rate of transition out of poverty
among those nonmetro elders who had been in
poverty for 11-20 years is only .057 (7 out of 123).
In all but two of the poverty duration categories,
the rate of exit from poverty is higher in metro than
nonmetro areas. Also, in nonmetro areas the sum of
all observed poverty exits (497) as a percentage of
the sum of all person-years (2,243) suggests that,
without considering the number of years in poverty,
22.2% of poor nonmetro elders exit poverty in a
given year. This compares to 25.4% among their
metro counterparts. In short, as expected, non-
metro elders appear to have a more difficult time
exiting poverty once they become poor. To provide
graphic support of this finding, Figure 1 shows
Kaplan-Meier curves for survival in poverty. These
curves reflect the probability that an elder remains
in poverty until time "t," where t is the time in years
since the observed start of a poverty spell. The fig-

ure offers further evidence of a small but nonethe-
less discernable disadvantage for nonmetro elders.
For example, while over 80% of metro elders escape
poverty after six years in a poverty spell, only about
75% of nonmetro elders are as fortunate.
Income Changes With Poverty Exits
Table 1 and Figure 1 confirm that poor elders ap-
parently move out of poverty with considerable fre-
quency. Again, while this may be at odds with popu-
lar perceptions of the nature of elderly poverty, it is
entirely consistent with other studies (e.g., Coe,
1988). However, the mere frequency of poverty exits
says nothing about how substantively meaningful
these exits are. After all, even a one dollar increase
in annual income can, by definition, be enough to
produce a transition out of poverty.
Table 2 sheds light on this question by showing
mean annual income changes, in 1987 dollars, for
those person-years in which a transition out of
poverty occurred. Broken down by years in poverty,
and by metro/nonmetro residence, the table shows
the mean and median changes in total household in-
come; the mean change in income from pensions,
earnings, interest and dividends, and social security;
and the average absolute change in the income-to-
needs ratio. Transitions out of poverty in the first
year were brought about by a mean total household
income increase of $3,970. The distribution of these
increases is skewed to the right due to a minority
of person-years in which tremendous income in-
creases were posted, so the median increases are
uniformly less, for example, $2,520 for those exiting
poverty after one year. To place this increase in per-
spective, the poverty threshold for an elderly couple
in 1987 was $6,876. Assuming, optimistically, that all
poor elderly couples had an income only one dollar
below their poverty threshold, then giving them the
median income increase of $2,520 would bring their
income up to $9,395, or 137% of the poverty thresh-
old -- still "near poor" by most definitions.
Looking across income types, poverty exits after
only one or two years in poverty are driven to a

large degree by increases in interest and dividend
income, and less so by increases in earnings and so-
cial security. This pattern likely reflects the strategy
whereby elders liquidate assets to boost their in-
come, a scenario which is consistent with the sud-
den drop in the annual increase from interest and
dividend income for those who have been in
poverty more than two years. The mean increase in
total household income among those exiting
poverty generally decreases as years-in-poverty in-
crease, as does the mean absolute change in the in-
come-to-needs ratio. Both patterns are consistent
with the prospect that those in poverty longer are
apt to be worse off, and thus less likely to rise much
above the poverty line when they do exit poverty.
When broken down by residence, the data offer a
conflicting picture as to whether the movements
out of poverty are more substantial among metro
elders, as theory might predict. The mean increase
in total household income and in the income-to-
needs ratio suggests greater absolute improvement
for those nonmetro person-years in which an exit
occurred. Conversely, the median increase in total
household income favors metro person-years. In
sum, the data yield no clear picture of residential
differences in the absolute economic improvement
that comes with an exit from poverty. Nonetheless,
the rather modest absolute increases in total house-
hold income, and in the income-to-needs ratio, sug-
gest that elders who exit poverty tend not to rise
much above the poverty threshold.
Multivariate Models of Poverty Exits
To provide insight into the determinants of pov-
erty exits and into the lower likelihood of poverty
exit among nonmetro elders, we use logistic regres-
sion to estimate nested discrete-time event history
models of transitions out of poverty. Model I in
Table 3 is a base model that includes only nonmetro
residence and years in poverty (the coefficients for
the latter are not shown). The effect of living in a
nonmetro area in the base model is negative, sug-
gesting a lower probability of exiting poverty com-
pared with those living in metro areas, but it is not
statistically significant (p = .157).
Model II adds selected sociodemographic and
work history characteristics of the family head. A
number of the coefficients are as expected. Black
household heads and female heads are less likely to
escape poverty, as are those who are never married
(compared to those who are married), while those
with at least some college education are more likely
to escape poverty. Except for the fact that heads
who had craft or operative occupations were more
likely to exit poverty, occupation has little effect.
Heads of household with more full-time years of
work experience, and families in which the head
and spouse (if present) worked more total hours in
the current year, were more likely to exit poverty.
Compared to the base model, the effect of non-
metro residence remains negative but becomes sta-
tistically significant in model II. This apparent sup-
pression effect is somewhat at odds with the fact
that nonmetro heads are c//sadvantaged with re-
spect to some of the variables that are significant in
model II. That is, nonmetro heads are more likely to
be never married and less likely to have some col-
lege or more, which should depress their prospects
for poverty exit. (Controlling for these variables
should make the nonmetro effect less negative, not
more negative.) It is the case the nonmetro elders
are less likely to be black and more likely to be mar-
ried, which could be contributing to the suppres-
sion of the negative effect of nonmetro residence.

Similarly, because nonmetro heads tend to be com-
paratively advantaged along measures of work his-
tory and employment status, controlling for these
variables makes the negative effect of living in a
nonmetro area even stronger. In other words, if
nonmetro heads had the same (low number of)
years of work experience and current labor supply
as metro heads, their prospects for exiting poverty
would be even more dim.
Model III adds a set of dummy variables indicat-
ing that various income types were received in the
current year. Poor elders who receive pension in-
come and interest and dividend income are more
likely to exit from poverty than those without any
income from these sources. Conversely, receipt of
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) depresses the
likelihood of exiting poverty. The latter finding may
seem ironic, when considering SSI targets low-in-
come elders, but is perfectly sensible in view of the
fact that only the very poor tend to qualify, and ben-
efit levels are relatively meager. When adding these
variables, the effect of nonmetro residence remains
negative and significant. Nonmetro, poor elders are
less likely to exit poverty than metro elders who are
otherwise comparable.
Summary and Discussion
The need for an analysis of elderly poverty may
seem questionable when viewed against national-
level trends showing declining poverty and improv-
ing economic well-being among older people over
recent decades. But this aggregate improvement
may mask both the transitory nature of elders' pov-
erty and the economic vulnerability of certain de-
mographic slices of the elderly population. Our
analysis of twenty years of longitudinal data from
the Panel Study of Income Dynamics corroborates a
limited number of other studies in showing consid-
erable movement out of poverty among poor el-
ders. Close to 40% leave poverty after one year.
However, the often modest increases in total annual
income and income-to-needs ratios suggests that
many of these exits may be the result of elders mov-
ing trivially above the poverty line.
From a policy perspective, the fact that many el-
derly people enter and exit poverty from year to
year is less important than whether there are sys-
tematic differences between those at risk and those
not, and whether these differences are amenable to
policy intervention. Our multivariate analyses sug-
gest that many of the factors that prevent poor el-
ders from exiting poverty -- such as being black,
never being married, or being less well educated --
are predetermined in old age, and outside the con-
trol of policy makers. Indeed, their effect would
seem to be the result of a cumulative stratification
process that, over the life course, places people at
higher risk of poverty once they become old, or
better able to exit poverty should they become
poor (Crystal & Shea, 1990). Policy initiatives to help
level the playing field and improve the lifelong em-
ployment prospects of younger people may help fu-
ture elderly cohorts, but will do little to ameliorate
the plight of today's poor elders.
A couple of the determinants of the exits from
poverty are more proximate and worthy of policy
makers' concern. First, those with greater labor sup-
ply were significantly more likely to exit poverty.
Even among elders, then, work represents a way
out. Policies to improve the supply of and demand
for the labor of able-bodied poor elderly people
can help them escape poverty. Second, for some,
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is one of the
few options for financial support. That those who
receive SSI are actually less likely to escape poverty,
other things equal, suggests that this program is
simply inadequate to ameliorate elderly poverty. As
individual states wrestle with new policies and pro-
grams in the current era of block grants, policy mak-
ers need to recognize the special plight of poor el-
ders and the inadequate benefit levels of prevailing
programs.
This paper also was motivated by the particularly
acute circumstances faced by many of today's rural
elders. On many indicators, nonmetro residents
suffer greater economic hardship in old age than
their metro counterparts. We were interested to see
whether that disadvantage also means they have a
harder time exiting poverty. Our results consis-
tently pointed toward a lower likelihood of poverty
exit among nonmetro than metro elders. The mul-
tivariate event history analysis verified the rural
disadvantage in poverty exits but offered limited ex-
planations for it. Indeed, when several sociodemo-
graphic and employment history characteristics of
household heads were included in the models, the
negative nonmetro effect became stronger and
more significant. This suppression effect reflects
the fact that nonmetro poor elders are more likely
than their metro counterparts to have a number of
characteristics, such as being married, being white,
and having more years of full-time work experience,
that make it easier to escape poverty. A challenge
for the future will be for researchers to provide firm
explanations for this rural disadvantage. Some in-
sight in this regard might be gained by using alter-
native definitions of rural and urban. For example,
the broad metro/nonmetro distinction we employ
here uses counties as building blocks, and there-
fore ignores the significant heterogeneity in rurality
that can exist within counties. To the extent that el-
ders follow national patterns by showing greater
levels of economic deprivation among those in
small towns or the open country and far from large
metropolitan areas, an analysis of their circum-
stances might uncover important clues to the rural
disadvantage in general.
