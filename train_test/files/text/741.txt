DataWatch
A Shifting Picture Of Health Insurance Coverage
by John Holahan, Colin Winterbottom, and Shruti Rajan
Abstract: Data from the Current Population Survey are used in this DataWatch to explore the
changing composition of health insurance coverage of the U.S. nonelderly population. The authors
analyze coverage trends across various subpopulations for 1988-1993. During this time significant
declines in employer-sponsored coverage coincided with equally significant increases in Medicaid
coverage. Thus, the increase in the proportion of nonelderly persons without health insurance appears
relatively small. However, this analysis reveals that the relative stability of the uninsurance rate for
the entire nonelderly population belies more significant changes in insurance coverage--and lack of
coverage--among various groups. The authors also discuss the extent to which a growing level of
public insurance "crowds out" (or substitutes for) private health insurance.
Concerns about gaps in health insurance coverage played a prominent
role in the health care reform debate of 1993-1994. The number of
Americans without health care coverage was too high, reform pro-
ponents argued, and the number was growing. Here we analyze changes in
insurance coverage at the national level from 1988 to 1993.
Our results show that the size of the uninsured population grew between
1988 and 1993, but the increase in the proportion of the nonelderly
population without health insurance was relatively small However, the
relative stability of the uninsurance rate masks two more significant trends:
The rate of coverage through private, employer-sponsored plans fell, while
the rate of coverage through the publicly funded Medicaid program rose.
Thus, the composition of insurance coverage has changed.
Because private and public health care coverage tend to benefit different
demographic groups, the groups that benefited from the growth of Medicaid
often were different from the groups most affected by declining employer
coverage. In fact, many of the groups that have the most extensive em-
ployer coverage saw their coverage erode, while groups that usually have
the highest rates of uninsurance made gains over the period.
The decline in employer-sponsored coverage is probably attributable to a
number of factors. First, health care costs have been rising much faster than

family incomes,1 Even in the last two years of this period, in which growth
of health costs seems to have slowed, these costs are still increasing faster
than growth in gross domestic product (GDP).2 This growth may be making
some employers less willing to offer coverage. Second, rather than dropping
coverage, some employers are shifting more of the costs of health insurance
onto employees by requiring them to pay a higher percentage of the pre-
mium.3 This shift, coupled with declines in average real family incomes,
makes workers less likely to accept their employers' offer of insurance.
Medicaid coverage has increased for several reasons. First, Medicaid
enrollment has increased to some extent because of the decline in family
incomes; some of this is due to the 1990-1992 recession and some to secular
declines in real incomes. Aid to Families with Dependent Children
(AFDC) rolls clearly have been expanding for reasons other than the
recession. Also, the number of Americans enrolled in the Supplementary
Security Income (SSI) program has continued to increase. The number of
disabled persons receiving Medicaid grew 6 percent per year between 1988
and 1992 and 12 percent during 1993. Finally, the series of legislative
expansions in Medicaid to cover children and pregnant women, beginning
in 1984 and culminating with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
(OBRA) of 1990, have added 3.5 million persons to Medicaid.4
Study data. The data used in this DataWatch are based on the March
1989 and March 1994 Current Population Surveys (CPS) with corrections
to Medicaid reporting as estimated by The Urban Institute's Transfer In-
come Model (TRIM2) microsimulation model. These data provide esti-
mates of health insurance coverage for 1988 and 1993.5
We adjust estimates of Medicaid coverage because this coverage is
known to be underreported on the CPS. For example, Medicaid administra-
tive data indicate that during 1990, 24.7 million nonelderly, noninstitu-
tionalized persons were enrolled in Medicaid. However, the uncorrected
CPS indicates only 19.6 million such persons reporting Medicaid enroll-
ment during that year. TRIM2 tests each person on the CPS for Medicaid
eligibility given the rules in effect in each person's state during the appro-
priate year, then selects additional eligible persons as Medicaid enrollees to
match enrollment from the administrative reports.6
Study Results
From 1988 to 1993 employer coverage fell from 67.0 to 61.1 percent
(Exhibit 1). However, Medicaid covered 12.4 percent of the nonelderly
population in 1993, an increase from 8.5 percent in 1988. There was also a
small increase in purchases of private nongroup coverage over the period.
Thus, if the composition of insurance coverage had been the same in 1993

as it was in 1988, 133 million more persons would have had employer
coverage, there would have been 8.8 million fewer persons in Medicaid,
and the number of uninsured persons would have been 4.1 million lower.
The composition of the uninsured population is changing dramatically.
Among those below 100 percent of poverty, there was a small drop in
employer-sponsored coverage, but Medicaid coverage of this group ex-
panded. The result was that the percentage of the poor population without
health insurance fell over the five years. The same was true among the
near-poor, but the Medicaid expansions did not completely offset the drop
in employer-sponsored coverage. The result was a 1.7-percentage-point

increase in the uninsurance rate. Among those above 200 percent of
poverty, there was a decline in employer coverage and slight increases in
nongroup coverage. Medicaid is not as important for these groups, so the
percentage of the uninsured population above 200 percent of poverty rose.
Among pregnant women, the percentage with employer-sponsored cov-
erage fell as Medicaid increased, resulting in a drop in the rate of uninsur-
ance from 10.8 percent to 7.9 percent (Exhibit 2). Among children ages ten
and under, employer-sponsored coverage fell, but again Medicaid increased,
resulting in a decline in the number of uninsured. There was a large
increase in the uninsurance rate for children ages eleven to seventeen, for
whom a four-percentage-point increase in Medicaid coverage did not offset
a seven-percentage-point loss in employer-sponsored coverage. Young

adults, ages eighteen to thirty-four, also experienced an increased rate of
uninsurance- For this group, employer-sponsored coverage dropped, al-
though there was some increase in the percentage covered by Medicaid,
probably because of AFDC enrollment or disability. But Medicaid increases
for this group were not sufficient to offset the decline in employer-spon-
sored coverage. Results were similar for those between ages thirty-five and
fifty-four. Medicaid coverage increased only slightly for this age group
because these persons are less likely to be eligible for Medicaid.
Exhibit 3 divides the population by income, pregnancy status, and age,
showing that the increases in overall insurance coverage primarily bene-
fited children and pregnant women below 200 percent of poverty. Insur-
ance coverage either remained stable or fell for all other groups.

not eligible for Medicaid- Among children and pregnant women at these
income levels, the percentage with employer-sponsored coverage fell, as
Medicaid coverage increased slightly. The percentage without insurance
increased from 6.5 percent to 9.4 percent. Among adults between ages
eighteen and thirty-four in this income range, the percentage with
employer-sponsored health insurance fell. The percentage who purchased
nongroup coverage increased, but not enough to offset the drop in employer
coverage. As a result, the percentage without insurance increased from 13.7
percent to 16.2 percent. Similarly, among higher-income adults ages thirty-
five to sixty-four, the percentage with employer-sponsored coverage fell by
4.0 percentage points. Medicaid coverage increased slightly, and the result
was a 2.7-percentage-point increase in persons without health insurance.
Exhibit 4 examines the same data by work status. Among full-time
workers, employer-sponsored coverage fell. There were small increases in
Medicaid and private nongroup coverage, but not enough to offset the
decline in employer-sponsored coverage. Thus, the percentage without
health insurance increased from 13.2 percent to 15.4 percent. Similarly,
among part-time workers, the increase in Medicaid coverage was not suffi-
cient to offset the drop in employer-sponsored coverage, and the percentage
of uninsured part-time workers increased from 19.3 percent to 21.7 percent.
The same pattern emerges for the self-employed.
Nonworkers fared somewhat better. Among dependents, the percentage
with employer-sponsored coverage fell from 73.2 percent to 66.2 percent, a
drop greater than that observed for full-time workers. But the percentage
obtaining Medicaid coverage increased from 7.6 percent to 13.3 percent.
Many of the workers who dropped dependent coverage may have been
low-wage workers who would be eligible for Medicaid. Among dependents,
the percentage without insurance increased less than it did for workers.
Persons in families with no workers often have employer-sponsored cover-
age, through retiree benefits, Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconcili-
ation Act (COBRA) provisions, or coverage by a family member outside
the home.7 This coverage declined from 13.3 percent to 10.9 percent.
There were also declines in nongroup and "other" coverage (such as Civil-
ian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services [CHAMPUS])
among this group. Because Medicaid coverage for this group increased
sharply, the percentage without health insurance changed very little.
Exhibit 5 examines the same results by race and sex.8 White males and
females are much more likely to have employer-sponsored coverage and
much less likely to be enrolled in Medicaid than nonwhites. Both white
and nonwhite females are more likely than males to be enrolled in Medic-
aid and much less likely to be uninsured. Among white males, employer-
sponsored coverage fell, while the percentage receiving Medicaid increased.

As a result, the percentage without health insurance increased. White
females and nonwhite males experienced a similar loss of employer cover-
age but made greater gains through Medicaid than white males did. Non-
white males also benefited from increased purchases of nongroup coverage.
Uninsurance increased among white females and nonwhite males. The
only group with apparent gains in coverage were nonwhite females.

coverage is much greater in the Northeast and Midwest than in the South
and West, and Medicaid coverage levels are comparable. As a result, there
were much lower percentages of the population without health insurance in
1988 in the Northeast and Midwest than in the South and West.
In the Northeast and Midwest employer coverage fell by 5.4 and 8.0
percentage points, respectively. States there did not increase Medicaid
coverage as much as those in the South and West did because, in general,
eligibility standards were more inclusive to begin with, and fewer people
met the income-related thresholds established by Medicaid for expanded
coverage for children and pregnant women. Medicaid coverage increased
by about three percentage points in both regions. Thus, the percentage of
these states' populations without insurance increased the most.

Medicaid And Private Health Insurance
It is likely that some portion of the low-income families that gained
Medicaid coverage were previously covered through the employer system--
some families that had to pay a share of premiums for employer-sponsored
coverage may have dropped those plans because they could obtain Medic-
aid coverage at no cost. David Cutler and Jonathan Gruber argue that new
Medicaid expansions have largely served to "crowd out" the private cover-
age families had before they were eligible for Medicaid.9 It is tempting to use
the data from our analysis to test the theory that new Medicaid coverage is
crowding out private coverage. For example, one could try to support this

hypothesis by looking at trends by age for families under 200 percent of
poverty (Exhibit 3). Those data show that the groups with the greatest
Medicaid gains also had the greatest declines in employer-sponsored cover-
age. (Some results support the counterargument, however. Looking at
trends by region in Exhibit 6, while the Northeast and Midwest had the
smallest gains in Medicaid coverage, they had the greatest losses of
employer-sponsored coverage.) These patterns are only suggestive, how-
ever. They do not in any way indicate a causal link between Medicaid gains
and declines in employer-sponsored coverage.
Declines in employer-sponsored coverage are occurring across all groups,
even those with no substantial access to Medicaid coverage. For example,
Exhibit 1 shows a 3.5-percentage-point drop in employer-sponsored cover-
age among the highest-income families, with only trivial access to Medic-
aid. Also, there clearly is a net gain in coverage as Medicaid coverage
increases for several groups. Medicaid coverage among the poor increased
7.6 percentage points, while employer-sponsored coverage fell only 1.6
points. While some of the families losing employer-sponsored coverage may
have enrolled in Medicaid, clearly many persons gaining Medicaid coverage
probably did not have employer-sponsored coverage before.10
The groups that have gained Medicaid coverage have lower incomes.
Declining employer-sponsored coverage among low-income workers could
be the result of a substitution effect (as families drop private coverage
because Medicaid is made available) or an income effect (as increases in
direct payment requirements for premiums and slowing wage growth force
families to drop coverage regardless of Medicaid). In recent years workers
have been required to pay a greater proportion of higher premiums. In 1987,
43 percent of workers with single coverage and 36 percent with family
coverage had employers that paid their full premiums; in 1993 these propor-
tions dropped to 34 percent and 26 percent, respectively. Given the greater
direct burden on families, one would expect employer-sponsored coverage
to drop most rapidly among low-income groups regardless of changes in
Medicaid access. In the absence of Medicaid eligibility, these persons might
have become uninsured.11
The evidence presented here clearly shows a net gain in coverage for
some groups and shows that many of the groups that experienced declines
in employer-sponsored coverage did not benefit from offsetting growth in
Medicaid. These patterns suggest that the importance of crowding out is
limited. But the data on this issue are not conclusive. We believe that the
CPS cannot be used to estimate the extent to which expanded Medicaid
eligibility has displaced private coverage. A study using longitudinal house-
hold data would allow for tracking of families' health coverage over time
and may help to improve our understanding of changes in family coverage.

Policy Implications
The relative stability of the uninsurance rate for the entire population
belies significant changes in insurance coverage--and the lack of cover-
age--among various subgroups. This finding as well as others from our study
are significant for several reasons. The analysis demonstrates the limitations
of continued reliance on private, employer-sponsored health care coverage.
Employer-sponsored coverage is sensitive to the business cycle, declining
family incomes, and the rising costs of health care. The analysis also
demonstrates the success of Medicaid in covering targeted groups. Were it
not for Medicaid, the share of Americans without health insurance cover-
age would have increased greatly during the period analyzed. If this had
occurred, it might have effected the recent debate over health care reform
in at least two ways. First, it might have increased the urgency with which
Congress felt it must deal with the problem of the uninsured. Second, it
might have made policymakers less interested in building on the current
employer-based health insurance system.
However, the successes of growing public coverage should be viewed in
perspective; these gains have come at a high cost to states and the federal
government. Spending on Medicaid has been the fastest-growing compo-
nent of most state budgets, crowding out spending on education and other
priorities in many states and leading to tax increases in others.12 Proposals
to shift responsibility for Medicaid coverage or to fund state programs
through block grants could halt the growth in public coverage and possibly
erode some of the recent growth in coverage we have observed. If this
occurs and if employer-sponsored coverage continues to decline, the num-
ber of uninsured Americans could increase sharply in the next few years.

5. The Census Bureau changed its method for weighting the CPS sample with the 1994
CPS. With the 1994 survey, the benchmark was shifted from the 1980 census to the
1990 census. This may introduce apparent changes not associated with actual trends
in the population. Analysis of the March 1993 CPS, for which weights are available
using both the 1980 and 1990 census benchmarks, suggests that the new weights do
not have a major impact on health insurance coverage across the population. In
addition, changes in health insurance coverage on the 1994 file (new weights) relative
to the 1993 file (with old weights) are consistent with changes from prior years, for
which there had been no change in weights. For these reasons, we do not believe that
the change in weighting methods is problematic for this analysis.

Members of families with no current worker may gain employer-sponsored coverage

8. It is worth noting that the subgroups considered in Exhibit 5 are not subject to
"intergroup migration" as are groups in other exhibits. That is, a person's race and sex
are fixed, while other characteristics analyzed--income, age, residence, and so on--may
have changed between 1988 and 1993. Therefore, interpretation of these exhibits is
not complicated by trends that move people across groups.

10. Even here this result is only suggestive. When we control for income group, we are not
looking at the same families in each year because the CPS is not a longitudinal survey.
In addition, families move in and out of income groups across these years, so poor
families in 1993 are different in important ways from poor families in 1988.
11. In their analysis, Cutler and Gruber argue that the decline in the proportion of
employers paying full premiums is related to expansions of Medicaid eligibility. They
argue that employers have increased workers' premium shares to encourage low-income
workers eligible for Medicaid to drop their employer plans. We believe that the
evidence offered is inconclusive, however. Cutler and Gruber's analysis shows a
negative correlation between workers' eligibility for Medicaid and employers' choice
to cover full health insurance premiums. Workers' eligibility for Medicaid also is
associated with low worker payrolls, so the correlation found between Medicaid
eligibility and partial payment of premiums may be an artifact of the relationship
between low average pay and partial payment of premiums. It is well established that
the cost of health care benefits has increased significantly in recent years. Low-payroll
firms are generally not as capable of absorbing increased benefit costs as firms with
higher payrolls are; for example, higher benefit costs cannot easily be passed to other
components ofcompensation because of minimum-wage restrictions. Thus, low-payroll
firms are more likely than higher-payroll firms to pass increased costs directly to workers.
In addition, Cutler and Gruber's analysis is dependent on the assumption that workers
observed on the CPS are representative of all workers at their firm, which is frequently
not the case.
