Abstract
Background: Little is known about the prevalence of dietary supplement (DS) use in American
adolescents. We conducted this study to analyze the prevalence of DS use and factors associated
with this use in a national population-based sample.
Methods: We used data from the 1999 ­ 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANES) for adolescents age 11 to 19. Using weighted logistic regression, we identified
demographic and clinical factors associated with the use of any DS, vitamins or minerals, herbs and
other DS.
Results: Among the 5,306 responses representing approximately 36 million Americans 11­19
years old, 27% reported use of one or more DS in the prior month. The most commonly used DS
were: multivitamins (16%) and vitamin C (6%). In the multivariable analysis, African American
[adjusted odds ratio 0.40 (0.31­0.50) 95% CI] and Mexican American [0.55 (0.44­0.69)]
adolescents were less likely to use DS compared with non-Hispanic whites. DS use was more
common in those who used prescription medications [1.37 (1.10­1.72)] and among those who had
a diagnosis of chronic headaches [1.25 (1.04­1.50)]. DS use was less common among those
reporting fair or poor health status [0.59 (0.40­0.88)].
Conclusion: Twenty seven percent of American adolescents use DS. DS use is higher among teens
that use prescription medications; physicians and pharmacists should be aware of this, ask patients,
and check for potential interactions.
Background
The 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act
(DSHEA) defined dietary supplements (DS) as vitamin,
mineral, herb/botanical, amino acid, enzyme, protein,
probiotic, glandular, or hormone-like substances [1]. Die-
tary supplements are used by more than 50 percent of

American adults [2]. Use in adults is most common in
those with higher income and education, women, and
those with chronic health conditions. Clinical, regional,
and internet-based surveys of adolescents have shown
higher DS use among athletes and teens with chronic ill-
nesses, but these associations need to be confirmed in
population-based national surveys [3-9]. In small clinical
surveys, pediatric chronic conditions for which herbal
therapies and dietary supplements were reported include:
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), asthma,
atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, cancer, inflammatory
bowel disease, headache, and cystic fibrosis [3,10-18].
The 1988­94 National Health and Nutrition Survey
(NHANES) found that approximately one fourth of ado-
lescents used DS [19]. The 1999­2000 NHANES reported
similar rates [20,21]. However, these analyses did not
explore self-reported clinical conditions associated with
teens' use of DS. [20,21]
We conducted this study to describe recent rates of DS use
among US adolescents and factors associated with that
use. Specifically, we wished to describe the prevalence of
DS use among US adolescents age 11 to 19 and to analyze
socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with DS
use. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that DS
use would be higher among: girls, older adolescents, non-
Hispanic whites, those who diagnosed with common out-
patient conditions, and those who reported using pre-
scription medications.
Methods
We used data from the 1999­2000 and 2000­2001
National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANES) [22]. NHANES is a series of nationally repre-
sentative surveys of the civilian, non-institutionalized
population in the United States administered by the
National Center for Health Statistics. The NHANES data
are collected through household interviews and physical
examinations at mobile examination centers. The sam-
pling technique follows a complex, stratified, multi-stage
probability design that over-samples adolescents, African
Americans, Mexican Americans, and persons of low-
income. NHANES has been conducted as a two year data
collection with data released for public use in two-year
increments. In 1999­2000 the household interview
response rate was 82 percent, and in 2001­2002 the
household interview response rate was 84 percent. Ado-
lescents younger than 16 years old had a proxy (family
member or guardian) answer for them unless they were an
independent minor. Those 16 years and older answered
the questions for themselves or had a proxy.
DS use was assessed from responses to questions asked
during the household interview: "Have you used or taken
any vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements in
the past month?" Those who said "yes" were asked to pro-
vide dose, frequency, and duration of use and were asked
to show the supplement containers to the interviewer so
that supplement details could be recorded. If the con-
tainer was not available (about 25 percent of the time),
participants were asked for the exact name of the product,
or to provide information in as much detail as possible.
Additionally, respondents were shown a card during the
interview with examples of dietary supplements including
herbs, vitamins, minerals, fiber supplements, amino
acids, fish oils, sport supplements, memory and energy
promoting products. The survey did not ask about medic-
inal herbal teas, medicinal foods (nutraceuticals), or folk
remedies.
Age, sex, race/ethnicity, total family income, physical
activity, and health status were generally obtained from
the head of household. We dichotomized the age variable
into two age groups 11­15 years old versus 16­19 years
old. Race/ethnicity was classified as non-Hispanic black,
non-Hispanic white, Mexican American, and all others.
Health status was assessed with the question "would you
say your health in general is... excellent, very good, good,
fair, or poor?" Respondents were asked if they used any
prescription medications in past month.
Finally, to address the question as to whether adolescents
with common out-patient conditions use more dietary
supplements, we extracted data on chronic non-life
threatening conditions frequently seen in out-patient
practices asked about during the NHANES interview.
Questions were asked about asthma, being overweight,
and ADHD with the phrasing, "Has the doctor or other
health professional ever told you that (you/he/she has) X
?". The conditions "hay fever in past year" and "frequent
severe headaches in past year" were based on self report,
not physician diagnosis. Many potentially clinically rele-
vant conditions such as acne, depression, cystic fibrosis,
and inflammatory bowel disease were not included in the
survey.
Statistical Analysis
We analyzed the data using SAS software (version 9.1; SAS
Institute, Cary, NC) and STATA software (version 8; Col-
lege Station, TX) due complex multistage design we used
survey specific commands in the STATA statistical package
which allowed incorporation of sampling weight strata,
and primary sampling units to analyze the data. Sampling
weights included adjustment for non-response, unequal
probability of selection used in the sampling design.
Because all data used in this study were from the interview
portions of the surveys, we used the four-year interviewed
sample weight for the combined analysis of NHANES
1999­2000 and NHANES 2001­2002 data [22].

We grouped the DS by category into vitamins/minerals or
non-vitamins/minerals. Vitamins/minerals included: 1)
any multivitamins/minerals (multivitamin/minerals or
prenatal multivitamin); 2) any single vitamins or miner-
als. For non-vitamin/mineral DS use we included the fol-
lowing categories: 1) herbal products (e.g. echinacea,
garlic); 2) non-herbal DS (e.g. probiotics, fish oil); and 3)
appearance or performance enhancing supplements (e.g.
protein powders or creatine). Some non-vitamin/mineral
DS included vitamins as minor ingredients. In our efforts
to capture the intended DS use by subjects, we used prod-
uct labeling information and advertising materials to
determine the category assignments.
We first assessed the associations between DS use and spe-
cific socio-demographic and clinical factors using the chi-
square test. Next, we performed multivariable logistic
regression to assess factors associated independently with
use of any DS, any vitamin/mineral DS, and non-vitamin/
mineral DS, while controlling for demographic, clinical
factors, and specific outpatient conditions (asthma,
ADHD, hayfever, headache, overweight). We selected var-
iables for testing in our logistic model based on the results
of previous studies and entered these variables into the
final model simultaneously [8,20,23]. The variable
income was removed from the model due to co-linearity
with the variable race/ethnicity (Standard error for race/
ethnicity increased by more than 25% when we added
income to the model). Additionally, our original hypoth-
esis questioned the association with race/ethnicity and
dietary supplement use. Therefore, we keep race/ethnicity
in the final model. However, since previous findings
showed an association between income and DS use, we
report descriptively the impact of income on DS use in the
bivariate data (table 1) [24,25]. Results of multivariable
models are presented as adjusted odds ratios with 95%
confidence intervals. Due to multiple comparisons, statis-
tical significance was set at a p value of 0.004 (Bonferroni
correction).
Results
There were 5306 participants from 11 to 19 years old, rep-
resenting approximately 36 million US adolescents.
Slightly more than half of respondents were in the 11 to
15 years old group and 49% were girls (Table 2). Most
adolescents reported very good to excellent health (71%).
Half of respondents reported one or more outpatient con-
ditions; the most common condition was chronic head-
ache (23%), followed by asthma (16%), hayfever (13%),
obesity (10%) and ADHD (9%). More than one quarter
(27%) of respondents had used prescription medications
in the previous month (Table 2).
Overall, 27% of youth reported using one or more DS in
the month prior to the survey. Non-vitamin/mineral DS
were used by fewer than 5% of youth (Table 1). Older
teens used more prenatal vitamins (p = 0.003) and iron (p
= 0.004) than younger teens.
Frequency of using DS was increased in those with higher
income. Non-Hispanic white youth used DS more com-
monly than minority youth (Table 3). DS use was highest
among those reporting very good or excellent health and
lowest among those with poor or fair health. Conversely,
DS was higher among those who reported using prescrip-
tion medications than those who did not. OverallDS use
was slightly lower in youth diagnosed with asthma or
overweight and higher among youth with ADHD, hay
fever, or headache.
In the a djusted multivariable model, certain demo-
graphic factors remained associated with DS use while
others did not (Table 4). For example, non-Hispanic Black
(0.40 [0.31­0.50] p = 0.000) and Mexican American (0.55
[0.44­0.69] p = 0.000) youth were less likely than non-
Hispanic white to use DS. Older teens were more likely
than younger teens to report using non-vitamin/mineral

DS (1.71 [1.11­2.63] p = 0.016), but not more likely to
use vitamin/mineral DS. On the other hand, after adjust-
ments, gender was no longer associated with overall DS
use or with any of the subcategories of DS use.
Similarly, in the adjusted model, some health factors
remained associated with DS use while others did not.
Compared with very good/excellent health, poor or fair
health status was associated with a lower overall DS use
(0.59 [0.40­0.88] p = 0.011). Conversely, adolescents
reporting use of a prescription medication had higher
overall rates of any DS (1.37 [1.10­1.72] p = 0.007) and
vitamin/mineral supplements (1.48 [1.16­1.90] p =
0.003) use than those who did not use prescription med-
ications.
After adjustment, the only specific condition that
remained associated with a greater overall DS use was
headache (1.25 [1.04­1.50] p = 0.018). Use of non-vita-
min/mineral DS was more common among obese
respondents (1.51 [1.07­2.13] p = 0.021).
Discussion
This study describes the relationship between several vari-
eties of DS use and clinical and socio-demographic factors
in a nationally representative sample of American adoles-
cents. Overall, 27% of adolescents reported using a DS in
the last month. DS use was higher among non-Hispanic
whites, those who reported better health status, and those
who used prescription medications. However, we did not
find the expected association between DS use and gender,
nor after controlling for other factors, between DS use and
any specific health condition other than headache. The
findings that the most commonly used DS by teens were
multivitamins (16%) and vitamin C (6%) is reassuring in
terms of potential health risks. The higher use of non-vita-
min/mineral supplements among obese teens raises ques-
tions about the types and safety of the specific DS used in
this growing population.
The prevalence of DS use in our sample was consistent
with that found in other large studies that used different
sampling techniques [4,19,26]. The use of some non-vita-
min/mineral supplements (e.g. sport and herbal perform-
ance enhancers) in this sample was lower than in studies
of teen athletes [27-32]. It was also lower than rates
reported in clinically based surveys [3,11,12,14,33]. Dif-
ferences in rates might be due to different usage in differ-
ent groups, differences in the time period of use, and by
different survey methods such as self report using the
Internet vs. parent or adolescent response in a face to face
interview [4].

In the adjusted model, certain demographic factors were
associated with supplement use, while others were not.
We confirmed findings of another large survey in which
older adolescents were more likely than younger teens to
use non-vitamin/mineral DS such as herbals, sports and
weight loss products [4]. Similarly, we confirmed earlier
reports that non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican American
adolescents use fewer vitamin/mineral DS than non-His-
panic white youth [4,19]. On the other hand, unlike ear-
lier studies, after adjusting for other factors, female gender
was not significantly associated with DS use [4,19]. Fur-
ther studies are needed to understand how race, culture,
income and health care disparities affect DS use and the
impact of this use on health status.
As expected, certain clinical factors were also associated
with DS use. For example, those reporting very good/
excellent health status reported higher rates of DS use,
confirming an earlier study [34]. The direction of this
association (Does use of DS cause good health or are
healthy teens more likely to use DS?) is a worthy question
for future research.
As expected, we found a higher rate of DS use among teens
who reported using prescription medications than those
who did not, even after adjusting for potential covariates
[23,24]. The etiology and clinical implications of the rela-
tionship between DS and prescription medication use
requires additional exploration. Given reports about clin-
ically serious interactions between prescription drugs and
herbals/supplements, physicians and pharmacists need to
be mindful of the higher use of DS among prescription
users, ask prescription medication users about their use of
DS, and monitor them for adverse effects or interactions.
The analysis of DS use by specific health conditions sug-
gested mixed relationships. For example, obese youth
were more likely to use non-vitamin/mineral DS than
their peers. The higher use among obese teens is likely due
to the inclusion of weight loss products in the non-vita-

min/mineral DS variable; this finding deserves more spe-
cific scrutiny in future research for two reasons: a) rates of
obesity are rising; b) weight loss products such as those
containing ephedra can present risks of serious toxicity or
drug-DS interaction. Also, adolescents with headaches
were more likely to use DS, confirming earlier reports
[35,36]. Future analyses are needed to look specifically at
different types of DS with different disorders and the
impact of DS use on disease-specific outcomes including
use of professional health care, health status, quality of
life, and ability to work or attend school.
Despite its large size, national scope, and extensive,
detailed ascertainment of DS use, this analysis has several
limitations. First, proxy information was used for
respondents less than 16 years old. Proxies (e.g. parents)
could have overestimated multivitamin use and under
estimated use of products teens may have purchased on
their own such as weight loss and performance-enhancing
supplements. Second, questions about dietary supple-
ments may have missed products considered home reme-
dies, folk remedies, or parts of the diet, such as green tea
or foods containing supplements. Furthermore, the lim-
ited data on specific health conditions reduced our ability
to assess the complex relationships between diseases and
DS use. Finally, since NHANES did not ask about reasons
for supplement use or the impact of this use on health sta-
tus, we do not know why teens used certain supplements
or how it affected their health [37].

Conclusion
DS use is most common among non-Hispanic white
youth and those taking prescription medications; use of
non-vitamin/mineral DS is most common among older
teens and those who are overweight. Therefore, physicians
and pharmacists should regularly ask patients about DS
use, and check for potential interactions. To better under-
stand use among culturally diverse groups and those with
different clinical conditions, future studies should include
a broader range of DS (such as those used in folk reme-
dies, foods and medicinal teas) and ask about common
health conditions. Additional studies are needed to deter-
mine the impact of DS use on health care use, health sta-
tus and quality of life.
