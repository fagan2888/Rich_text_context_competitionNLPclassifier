The Prevalence and Impact of
Accommodations on the Employment of
Persons 51­61 Years of Age with
Musculoskeletal Conditions
Edward Yelin, Dean Sonneborn, and Laura Trupin
Objective. To provide estimates of the frequency
with which persons 51 to 61 years of age with mus-
culoskeletal conditions receive workplace accommo-
dations from their employers and to determine if the
receipt of such accommodations is associated with
higher rates of employment two years later.
Methods. The estimates derive from the Health
and Retirement Survey, a national probability sam-
ple of 8,781 respondents who were interviewed both
in 1992 and 1994 and who were between the ages of
51 and 61 years, of whom 5,495 reported one or more
musculoskeletal conditions. We tabulated the fre-
quency of accommodations provided in 1992 and
then estimated the impact of accommodations and
demographic and medical characteristics on 1994
employment status, using logistic regression.
Results. In 1992, about 14.40 million persons
aged 51­61 years reported a musculoskeletal condi-
tion. Of these, 1.32 million (9.2%) reported a disabil-
ity and were employed, the target population for
accommodations. Overall, fewer than 1 in 5 persons
with musculoskeletal conditions who had a disabil-
ity and were employed indicated that they had re-
ceived any form of accommodation on their current
jobs. Although no form of accommodation was re-
ported with great frequency, the most commonly
used ones included getting someone to help do one's
job (12.1%), scheduling more breaks during the work
day (9.5%), changing the time that the work day
started and stopped (6.3%), having a shorter work
day (5.6%), getting special equipment (5.3%), and
changing the work tasks (5.3%). Persons with one or
more accommodations in 1992, however, were no
more likely to be working in 1994 than those with
none. Only one specific accommodation--getting
someone to help do one's job--was associated with a
higher rate of employment in 1994.
Conclusions. Receipt of employment accommo-
dations occurred infrequently, and was not generally
associated with an improvement in the employment
rate of persons with musculoskeletal conditions and
disabilities.
Key words. Workplace accommodations; Muscu-
loskeletal conditions; Disability.
INTRODUCTION
Persons with musculoskeletal conditions, espe-
cially those who report disability, have low labor
force participation rates, a situation that has im-
proved very little in the last 15 years despite the
overall increase in employment among all working
age adults in the United States (1). In 1990 Congress

passed and President Bush signed into law the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in part to
rectify low levels of employment among persons
with disabilities, including those with musculoskel-
etal conditions (2,3).
Title 1 of the ADA mandates that persons with
disabilities be offered reasonable accommodation by
employers, whether they are seeking to hold onto a
job or to obtain a new one (3). Do such accommoda-
tions help persons with disabilities stay employed?
The studies that are not limited to persons with
musculoskeletal conditions indicate both that ac-
commodation is quite common and that it is associ-
ated with increased rates of employment (4­7).
However, we could find no studies that evaluated
the impact of accommodation on a prospective basis,
which leaves open the possibility of a reporting bias
in which persons who continued to work were more
likely to report having received accommodation,
whether or not that is truly the case.
With respect to musculoskeletal conditions, sev-
eral studies using clinical samples of persons with
discrete rheumatic conditions and one using a na-
tional community-based sample of persons with all
forms of musculoskeletal conditions indicate that
workers whose employers provide them with auton-
omy on the job or who have flexible work rules on
the job are more likely to remain in the labor force
(8­10); one study of persons with rheumatoid arthri-
tis (RA) indicated that such workers were not more
likely to stay employed (11). However, none of these
studies actually reported on the use of specific ac-
commodations, and none evaluated the impact of
receiving an accommodation at one point on subse-
quent employment. In this article we document the
extent to which persons with musculoskeletal con-
ditions who report disability are receiving accommo-
dations through their employers and whether or not
persons who receive accommodations are actually
more likely to stay employed two years later.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Data source. This report makes use of data from
the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), a national
probability sample of noninstitutionalized persons
born between 1931 and 1941, and their spouses,
regardless of their year of birth (12,13). The HRS is a
longitudinal survey with interviews every two years
beginning in 1992; the first two years are currently
available for analysis. The survey includes extensive
data on health and disability status, and measures of
current and prior employment.
The present analysis includes respondents who
were between the ages of 51 and 61 years in 1992,
thus omitting any spouses outside the 1931­1941
birth cohort. We have also excluded anyone who did
not complete both waves of the survey.
Definitions. Morbidity. In the HRS, respondents
were asked in both 1992 and 1994 about the pres-
ence of major classes of chronic conditions, includ-
ing high blood pressure; diabetes; cancer (by site);
asthma; other chronic lung disease; coronary heart
disease, angina, congestive heart failure, or other
heart problems; stroke; emotional, nervous, or psy-
chiatric problems; and arthritis or rheumatism or
problems with back or feet. We labeled this last
group "musculoskeletal conditions."
The self-reported diagnoses in the HRS should not
be construed as being entirely consistent with diag-
noses that a physician would provide as a result of a
history, physical exam, and laboratory testing, nor
are they based on as rigorous a coding scheme as that
used in the National Health Interview Survey. As a
result, they cannot provide an indication of the prev-
alence of discrete conditions, e.g., RA. However,
they do indicate the prevalence of symptomatic
and/or self-recognized chronic conditions.
Disability. There are several ways to identify per-
sons with disabilities in the HRS. First, the employ-
ment status question includes "disabled and unable
to work" as one of several possible responses, along
with working, looking for work, and attending
school. Using this response to define disability
would create an obvious tautology in an analysis of
the relationship between employment and disabil-
ity. Second, the health status section contains ques-
tions related to physical functioning that identify
difficulties in performing tasks with a wide range of
requirements, from basic activities of daily living
(eating, dressing, toileting) to jogging a mile. There is
also a series of questions about limitations in paid
work. We chose to use this activity limitation mea-
sure because it is most consistent with other health
surveys, such as the National Health Interview Sur-
vey. This measure is also more in keeping with the
spirit of the ADA, which defines disability based on
a person's interaction with the social environment,
rather than on capacity to perform self-care or to
engage in physical activities. Thus, in this report, a
person is considered to have a disability if he or she
reports a limitation in work. When the term "disabil-
ity" is used in the remainder of this report, it should
be remembered that disability is defined in terms of
limitation in work, and that the disability measure
Arthritis Care and Research Impact of Accommodations on Employment 169
does not distinguish among levels of the severity of
disability.
Employment. In each wave of interviews in the
HRS, respondents are administered the employment
status measure from the Current Population Survey,
the source of federal statistics on labor force partic-
ipation (14). The analyses below are limited to those
who reported working in 1992.
Accommodations. In 1992, the HRS respondents
were asked about the presence of accommodations at
the job held at the onset of physical impairments, at
any new jobs entered after onset of impairment, and
at their current (as of 1992) jobs. The accommoda-
tions included: 1) providing someone to help the
respondent, 2) a shorter work day, 3) more breaks
and rest periods, 4) special transportation, 5) special
equipment, 6) changing the time that work started
and stopped, 7) training for new skills, and 8) chang-
ing the job to something the respondent can do. Both
because the reliability of respondents' reports about
accommodations provided in the past may be sus-
pect and because our intent is to evaluate the impact
of contemporaneous accommodations on subse-
quent employment, we did not include the informa-
tion about past accommodations in our analyses.
Analyses. In the HRS, there were 8,781 respon-
dents between the ages of 51 and 61 years who were
interviewed both in 1992 and 1994, of whom 5,495
reported one or more musculoskeletal conditions.
Because of our focus on accommodations among
persons with musculoskeletal conditions who were
employed and who reported disabilities, the princi-
pal analyses below are limited to the 502 who met
these criteria. The groups excluded are the 3,005
persons with musculoskeletal conditions who were
employed but who did not report disability, the
1,156 who were not employed and reported disabil-
ity, and the 832 who were not employed and did not
report disability.
The HRS sample was constructed using a national
multistage probability design, with a basic sampling
frame of the noninstitutionalized population within
the nation. In addition, the HRS oversampled Afri-
can Americans, Hispanics, and, because of the age
range of interest, residents of Florida (12). The re-
sponse rate for the overall sample in the HRS was
0.821; the response rate for the oversample frames
among African Americans was 0.826, among Florid-
ians 0.828, and among Hispanics 0.776.
The HRS public use data files include sampling
weights to account for the oversample, nonresponse,
and for attrition among respondents between 1992
and 1994. In describing the prevalence of the per-
sons with musculoskeletal conditions, stratified by
employment and disability status, we use expansion
weights that allow us to report the frequency in the
population at large. Thus, after the application of the
sampling weights, the persons with musculoskeletal
conditions interviewed both in 1992 and 1994 rep-
resent approximately 14.40 million persons, while
the 502 persons with musculoskeletal conditions
who were employed and reported disability in 1992
represent approximately 1.32 million.
We first show the medical and demographic char-
acteristics of persons with musculoskeletal condi-
tions by their disability and employment status. Sub-
sequently, we indicate the frequency with which
employed persons with musculoskeletal conditions
and disability report each kind of accommodation,
any form of accommodation, and the total number of
accommodations. In order to determine whether
there are patterns to the receipt of accommodations,
we then use multivariate logistic regression to esti-
mate the impact of the demographic and medical
characteristics of these individuals as well as of their
occupations on the probability that they receive in-
dividual accommodations or any form of accommo-
dation or on the total number of accommodations.
Finally, we estimate multivariate models of the
impact of individual accommodations, any form of
accommodation, or the total number of accommoda-
tions on 1994 employment status. In addition to the
accommodation variables, the models include these
characteristics: sex, race (white versus non-white),
marital status (married versus not married), extent of
formal education, family income, global physical
health status, global mental health status, whether or
not the individual reported one or more nonmuscu-
loskeletal conditions, the total number of limita-
tions reported in physical activities, and whether the
individual was in a white or blue collar occupation
in 1992.
In the two sets of logistic regressions, we use pro-
portional weights, that is, weights that take into ac-
count the sampling methods described above but
that are scaled to the actual sample size, in this case
502 persons. As a result, test statistics are estimated
on the actual sample size.
A selection bias may affect the estimates of the
impact of accommodation on employment. Such a
bias may exist if the respondents who receive accom-
modation are more severely affected than those who
do not, with the result that those who receive accom-
modation were substantially more likely to stop
working. To determine if such a bias affects the
results, we estimated a corrective factor (lambda) for
selection bias using LIMDEP software (15) and then
170 Yelin et al Vol. 13, No. 3, June 2000
added the corrective factor to models testing the
impact of accommodation.
The HRS sample was constructed using a national
multistage probability design, with systematic over-
sampling of African Americans, Hispanics, and res-
idents of Florida (12). To take into account the com-
plex nature of the design, we used SUDAAN
software for the calculation of standard errors and
computation of statistical tests for all the results
reported below (16). SUDAAN makes use of the Tay-
lor series linearization method. Specifically, we used
this software to describe the characteristics of per-
sons with musculoskeletal conditions in strata de-
fined by disability and employment status, to esti-
mate the impact of demographic and medical
characteristics and occupations on the probability of
using specific accommodations or any form of ac-
commodation among those with disabilities and
who were employed in 1992, and to estimate the
impact of accommodations on employment in the
latter group.
RESULTS
Table 1 compares the demographic and medical
characteristics of persons with musculoskeletal con-
ditions in 1992, by disability and employment sta-
tus. In 1992, about 14.40 million persons aged 51­61
years reported a musculoskeletal condition. Of
these, 1.32 million (9.2%) reported a disability and
that they were employed, 8.05 million (55.9%)
stated that they did not have a disability and that
they were employed, 2.85 million (19.8%) had a
disability but were not employed, and 2.18 million
(15.1%) said that they were not disabled and were
not employed.
In part because we limited our analysis to the HRS
respondents who were 51­61 years old in 1992, the
age structure of the 4 groups did not differ substan-
tially. Women constitute a significantly larger frac-
tion of those who were not employed--both with
and without disabilities--and non-whites a signifi-
cantly larger fraction of those who reported a disabil-
ity and not being employed. Not surprisingly, the
persons with musculoskeletal conditions who were
employed were more likely to have at least a high
school degree. No doubt reflecting the contribution
of their own earnings to family income, those who
were employed were more likely to have higher fam-
ily incomes.
Persons with musculoskeletal conditions report-
ing disability were more likely to have chronic con-
ditions other than the musculoskeletal one. Such
persons, particularly those who were not employed,
were much less likely to report excellent, very good,
or good physical health status. Persons with disabil-
ities who were not employed were more likely to
report poor mental health status.
In the remainder of this article, we focus on the

Arthritis Care and Research Impact of Accommodations on Employment 171
approximately 1.32 million with disabilities who
were employed in 1992; such persons would be the
principal target for providing accommodations at
work. Among these persons, the musculoskeletal
conditions were cited as a cause of the individuals'
disability 69% of the time and as the main cause
58% of the time. Work loss occurred frequently
among those who were employed with disability:
between 1992 and 1994, 25% stopped working.
Table 2 shows the frequency with which accom-
modations were reported by these individuals. Over-
all, only 17.9% of persons with musculoskeletal con-
ditions who had a disability and were employed
indicated that they had received any form of accom-
modation on their current jobs. Although no form of
accommodation was reported with great frequency,
the most commonly used ones included getting
someone to help do one's job (12.1%), scheduling
more breaks during the work day (9.5%), changing
the time that the work day started and stopped
(6.3%), having a shorter work day (5.6%), getting
special equipment (5.3%), and changing the work
tasks (5.3%). Receiving training in new skills (3.3%)
and receiving special transportation (1.8%) were re-
ported less frequently. Although a relatively small
proportion reported receiving accommodations,
among those who did, the majority stated that they
had received two or more, which may indicate that
workplaces that provide one form of accommodation
are more likely to provide other forms as well.
In Table 3, we show the impact of individual de-
mographic and medical characteristics and occupa-
tion on the receipt of each of the forms of accommo-
dation, after taking into account the other variables
in the model. In general, health and functional status
were the most consistent characteristics associated
with accommodation. For example, poor health was
associated with having been provided a shorter work
day and more breaks during the day. Similarly, per-
sons who reported high levels of functional limita-
tions were more likely to report being able to take
more breaks during the day and to receive special
transportation and equipment. Such persons were
also more likely to report receiving any form of ac-
commodation. With respect to demographic factors,
men were more likely to report receiving special
equipment and the opportunity to change the tasks
to those they could do; this may reflect the kinds of
work men do and longer tenure on their jobs. Of
note, persons who were married were less likely to
report receiving special transportation, perhaps be-
cause they can rely on their spouses for this service.
In addition, white collar workers were more likely to
report being able to change the time that work starts
and stops than persons in blue collar occupations.
Similarly, persons with higher incomes were more
likely to report learning a new skill or receiving any
form of accommodation.
After adjustment for demographic and medical
characteristics, accommodation did not have a
strong positive effect on employment (Table 4). In-
deed, the only form of accommodation that was as-
sociated with an increase in employment was getting
someone to help with work. Persons who reported
receiving a change in work tasks and those who
reported learning new skills were actually less likely
to be employed in 1994 than those who did not,
suggesting that receiving these forms of accommoda-
tion did not succeed in forestalling the loss of em-
ployment. Overall, we found that receiving any form
of accommodation in 1992 had no impact on the
employment rate in 1994.
DISCUSSION
Work disability accounts for a majority of the eco-
nomic costs of musculoskeletal conditions (17);
musculoskeletal conditions, in turn, are among the
most common conditions associated with work dis-
ability (1). Unfortunately, return to employment oc-
curs relatively rarely among persons with musculo-
skeletal conditions (18). As a result, to increase the
proportion of persons with musculoskeletal condi-
tions who are employed, it is necessary to increase
the proportion who stay on the job. This has not
occurred, since we found that 25% of the persons
with musculoskeletal conditions who were em-

Arthritis Care and Research Impact of Accommodations on Employment 173
ployed with disability in 1992 had stopped working
as of 1994.
The principal federal legislation to increase em-
ployment among persons with disabilities is the
ADA of 1990. Under the ADA, employers are re-
quired to provide reasonable accommodations to
persons with disabilities, provided that the persons
with disabilities can perform the essential functions
of the job. Are accommodations being provided, and,
if so, do the accommodations provided improve the
employment rate among persons with musculoskel-
etal conditions and disability?
In this report, we used data from a national prob-
ability sample of noninstitutionalized adults aged
51­61 years to answer these two questions. We
found that fewer than one-fifth of persons with mus-
culoskeletal conditions and disabilities who were
employed in 1992 reported receiving any form of
accommodation and that the receipt of such accom-
modation in that year did not improve the employ-
ment rate as of 1994. The only exception to this
finding is that persons who stated that they received
help from someone else to do their job had higher
employment rates in the latter year.
The study had relatively limited power to detect
such effects. Although there were 5,495 persons with
musculoskeletal conditions interviewed in both
1992 and 1994, only 502 of them were employed
with disabilities, and accommodations occurred in-
frequently (from a low of 1.8% reporting the receipt
of special equipment to a high of only 12.1% report-
ing the receipt of help from someone else). In addi-
tion, the list of accommodations may not have been
specific enough for musculoskeletal conditions, pre-
cluding the possibility of finding a positive effect on
employment. Finally, it may be necessary to apply
accommodations early after onset of disease, but
there were too few incident cases of musculoskele-
tal-related disability to detect an effect of accommo-
dations provided at this point in the disease.
What can account for the infrequency with which
accommodations are provided? It is possible that
employers and persons with disabilities were not
fully acclimated to the ADA in 1992. Large employ-
ers had only been subject to the regulations under
the ADA for one year as of 1992, and smaller em-
ployers were just becoming subject to them in that
year. As a result, accommodations may have been
provided only to those workers with severe medical
conditions, for whom the a priori probability of the
maintenance of employment was low. The results of
this study support this view, as physical and mental
health status and the number of functional limita-
tions were the most consistent characteristics asso-
ciated with the receipt of accommodations. Figure 1
provides additional support for this view by show-
ing that the probability of accommodation only rises
substantially as the number of functional limitations
is in the upper quintile, after the point at which the
probability of employment begins to fall. Thus, accom-
modations may be provided when functional status
is so poor as to preclude continued employment.
Assuming that the finding that accommodation
did not have a positive impact on employment is not
due to the sample size, what may account for the
lack of effect? The macroeconomic situation in 1992
may be partially responsible. Unemployment rates
were relatively high in that year. High unemploy-
ment rates reduce the employment of persons with
disabilities to a greater extent than among persons
without disabilities (19), and, indeed, the high un-
employment rates in that year resulted in a substan-
tial increase in the number of persons applying for
Social Security Disability Insurance benefits (20).
Moreover, 25% of all persons with musculoskeletal
conditions who were employed in 1992 lost or left
their jobs by 1994, suggesting that a strong protective
effect of accommodation would have been necessary
to preserve employment. Because the ADA had only
recently been implemented, the unemployment rate
was high, and accommodations were offered infre-
quently and, when offered, were provided to persons

with musculoskeletal conditions of heightened se-
verity, 1992 may not provide a fair test of the effect of
accommodation on employment of persons with
musculoskeletal conditions and disabilities.
Nevertheless, the results of this inquiry indicate
that in 1992 when the ADA was first being imple-
mented, accommodations were not often provided to
persons with musculoskeletal conditions and dis-
ability, and when provided did not appear to result
in a substantial improvement in their 1994 employ-
ment. The ADA mandates reasonable accommoda-
tion, necessitating continued vigilance to ensure that
the law is being followed, and if not, to determine
why. Assuming that the frequency of accommoda-
tion has increased since 1992 due to the dissemina-
tion of information about the ADA, it will be inter-
esting to determine if an increased frequency of
accommodation also results in an increased impact
on employment. In turn, it will be necessary to de-
termine if the increasing effectiveness of accommo-
dation is merely the result of providing accommoda-
tion to those of lesser disease severity or is due to
increased knowledge as to what kinds of accom-
modations to provide and when to provide them.
However, as of 1992, persons with musculoskeletal
conditions and disability were not receiving accom-
modations very often and, even when receiving
them, the impact on employment was not substantial.
