Public calls to boycott retail establishments, restaurants,
and other companies, in response to corporate political
activity, are seemingly on the rise in the United States.
Boycotts often trigger calls to buycott the same commer-
cial establishments by political opponents on the other
side. In one recent example, Donald Trump encouraged
his supporters to "buy L.L. Bean" after Democrats called
for a boycott of the brand upon learning the company's
heiress, Linda Bean, donated large sums to a pro-Trump
political action committee (PAC) (Victor, 2017). Other
brands such as New Balance (Gilbert, 2016), Nordstrom
(Allison and Rupp, 2017), Starbucks (Mazza, 2017), Uber
(Said, 2017), and Under Armour (Kilgore, 2017) have all
been targets of boycotts and/or buycotts in the last year
related to political or social issues. Survey data show that
sizeable percentages of Americans report having boy-
cotted or buycotted a product or company (Baek, 2010;
Newman and Bartels, 2011; Stolle and Micheletti, 2013;
Copeland, 2014a) and that such political consumerism
appears to have become more widespread in many west-
ern countries, including in the United States (Stolle and
Micheletti, 2013).1 Although political consumerism has
received a fair amount of scholarly attention, we still have
an incomplete picture of the sociopolitical and demo-
graphic underpinnings of this behavior.
The current study advances several objectives. First, we
aim to update previous studies of political consumerism with
an eye towards developing longitudinal perspectives of such
behavior and examining the factors that currently explain it.
Our approach engages potential limitations in the extant
research and adopts refinements to address measurement and
other methodological concerns. Next we seek to build upon
existing scholarship in two substantive ways. A central goal
is to examine how individuals'partisan identities find expres-
sion in their consumer choices. We focus not only on the
instrumental aspects of partisanship but also on "expressive
partisanship," which, as we discuss below, scholars view as a
related but distinct concept (Huddy etal., 2015). We also
investigate how contextual changes, most notably, the prolif-
eration of social media and ensuing changes in interpersonal
networks, may influence political consumerism.
We leverage a variety of empirical sources to pursue our
objectives. We analyze two, nationally-representative sur-
veys conducted by YouGov in 2016 and an original, third
survey of registered voters that included a partisan identity
battery adopted from Huddy etal. (2015). As a preview, we
find that instrumental components of partisanship are
Boycotts, buycotts, and political
consumerism in America

Abstract
Anecdotal and experimental evidence suggests that at least some consumers change their purchasing behavior in response
to the values, reputations, and political activity of corporations. Using two nationally-representative surveys and a third
survey of registered voters, we find Americans' engagement in boycotts and/or buycotts for political or social reasons to
be widespread. Social media activity, political knowledge, ideological intensity, and an interest in politics are significantly
associated with political-consumer behavior. Among partisans, we find both instrumental and expressive partisanship to
be significant predictors of political consumerism.

strongly associated with political consumerism and that
individuals with strong expressive partisan identities are
more likely to report boycott participation. Our analyses
also suggest social media activity is associated with politi-
cal consumerism. We proceed by providing a brief over-
view of political consumerism, how it is measured, and our
expectations about the relationship between boycotts/buy-
cotts and partisanship. We then describe our data and meth-
odological procedures and report our findings.
Background and expectations
Political consumerism is often considered an extension of
"lifestyle politics" (Bennett, 1998) where politics infiltrates
non-political aspects of our daily routines. The decision to
patronize one business over another falls into this broad
category. Over time, the study of political participation has
expanded to include forms of non-electoral participation
such as protest (Barnes and Kaase, 1979), volunteering
(Verba, Schlozman and Brady, 1995) and eventually politi-
cal consumerism (Newman and Bartels, 2011). In fact, a
goal of the initial political science research on consumer-
ism was to establish it as a form of political participation
(Newman and Bartels, 2011; Baek, 2010). Empirical exam-
inations of survey data documented substantial overlap
between many of the characteristics that predict consumer-
ism and those that predict other forms of participation
(Newman and Bartels, 2011; Copeland, 2014a).
Early research about the topic used a variety of question
wordings when inquiring about participation in boycotts and
buycotts. Generally, researchers have taken a broad approach
by asking about purchasing decisions for "political, ethical,
or environmental reasons." Referencing the environment in
questions designed to measure political consumerism may
inflate estimates of those, particularly on the left, who
engage in politically-minded shopping or eating (Stolle and
Micheletti, 2013: 73). In the current study, we narrow our
attention to boycotts and buycotts arising from "social and
political" (dis)agreements with corporate entities and ask
identical questions in all three surveys to evaluate whether
political consumerism fluctuates during the relatively short
time period between our surveys. Large variations have
been observed in prior studies. Both context and question
wording may contribute to these discrepancies. For exam-
ple, a 2002 survey found that almost half of Americans had
previously participated in boycotts or buycotts (Baek, 2010).
This estimate is on the high end and is likely an artifact of
the question wording, which did not specify a time period.
The frequency of boycott or buycott behavior is usually
lower when questions reference a specific time frame, gen-
erally, the previous year (e.g., Newman and Bartels, 2011;
Copeland, 2014a and 2014b). To maximize comparability,
we follow this approach in our studies.
Much has changed since many of the initial studies
about political consumerism were conducted, including
how Americans acquire political information as well as
growing partisan polarization. One prominent difference is
the popularization of social media, which is a leading
source of information about the implications of consump-
tion choices (Stolle and Micheletti, 2013). Social media is
particularly relevant for some segments of the population
that are highly active online (see Becker and Copeland,
2016) and may accelerate how quickly information con-
cerning corporate political activity reaches everyday
Americans. Exposure to information about companies and
industries that violate (or conform to) citizens'political val-
ues is a necessary component for political consumerism
(Becker and Copeland, 2016; Neilson and Paxton, 2010;
De Zúñiga et
al., 2014; Wicks et
al., 2014; Stolle and
Micheletti, 2013). Accordingly, we expect that social media
use will be positively correlated with political consumer-
ism, although we recognize that relevant information may
reach the public through a variety of channels, including
traditional ones.
When Americans encounter information about the polit-
ical activities of corporations and brands, they may be
motivated to reward or punish them by either purchasing or
declining to purchase their goods or services. Partisans
today are potentially more reactive to political information
about corporate entities, given that Democrats and
Republicans have become more polarized in recent years,
and Americans affiliated with each party increasingly dis-
like the opposition (Webster and Abramowitz, 2017;
Lelkes, 2016; Iyengar, Sood and Lelkes, 2012). Affective
polarization, or hostility toward opposing partisans, seems
to be growing, ingrained or automatic in voters' minds and
as potent as animus based on race (Iyengar and Westwood,
2015). Moreover, the "intrusion" or "gradual encroach-
ment" of party preference into nonpolitical or personal
domains is causing nonpolitical judgments and behaviors
to reflect the influence of partisan cues (Iyengar and
Westwood, 2015: 691). However, not all partisans will be
moved to boycott or buycott. We suspect political consumer
behavior to vary based on the expressive and instrumental
components of individuals' partisan identities. Expressive
partisanship refers to one's longstanding identity as either a
Democrat or a Republican (see Huddy et
al., 2015 and
Green etal., 2002), whereas instrumental partisanship can
be viewed as "a running tally of party performance, ideo-
logical beliefs, and proximities to the party in terms of
one's preferred policies" (Huddy etal., 2015: 1). Standard
measures of strength of partisanship do not allow for a dis-
tinction between expressive and instrumental partisanship.
A strong expressive partisan identity has been linked to
campaign activity and electoral participation (Huddy etal.,
2015; Miller and Conover, 2015), but its connection to non-
electoral forms of behavior such as consumerism has not
been evaluated. While less direct than campaigning, we
expect expressive partisanship to be associated with
Americans' decisions to reward or punish companies for
Endres and Panagopoulos 3
political or social reasons. Calls to boycott or buycott com-
panies for their political activities, including, as the L.L.
Bean example showcases, the endorsements or contribu-
tions of its affiliates, might be particularly motivating for
partisans with a strong expressive identity.
There are several reasons to believe that instrumental
partisanship is also associated with political consumerism.
In fact, much of the extant research has focused on a brand's
policy record. When partisans are called upon to boycott or
buycott companies for actions related to the policy propos-
als of a party or candidate, instrumental partisanship could
motivate the action. Recent examples that strike an instru-
mental tone include calls by Republicans to boycott
Starbucks following its criticism of Trump's refugee policy
(Mazza, 2017) and boycotts by Democrats against New
Balance after it signaled support for Trump's policy on the
Trans-Pacific Partnership (Gilbert, 2016). A priori, we are
agnostic about the relative effects of instrumental versus
expressive partisanship on political consumerism, but we
explore this question empirically below.
Data and methods
We use data from three sources­the American National
Election Study (ANES) 2016 Pilot, and two original sources,
the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES)
and an original survey of registered voters. The ANES pilot
is a cross-sectional survey fielded in January 2016 to a sam-
ple of 1200 adults. The CCES data was collected during the
2016 presidential election. Our political consumerism items
were included on the pre-election instrument that was
administered beginning in late September to 1000 partici-
pants. Both the ANES and the CCES were conducted online
by YouGov. In our analyses, we apply the weights provided
for each survey. Our survey of registered voters was fielded
from late March to early April 2017 to a random sample of
10,000 voters nationally provided by L2, a commercial list
vendor; 397 US voters participated in the survey, represent-
ing an overall response rate of about 4%. This survey probed
respondents about political consumerism as well as about
the 2016 elections and several policy issues.2
We measure consumer behavior identically across all
surveys using separate questions on participation in boy-
cotts and buycotts. Specifically, respondents were asked,
"In the last 12 months, have you bought a certain product or
service because of the social or political values of the com-
pany that provides it, or have you not done that in the past
12 months?" and "In the last 12 months, have you declined
to buy a certain product or service because of the social or
political values of the company that provides it, or not?"3
Asking identical questions before the start of the presiden-
tial nominations and again in the weeks before the general
election allows us to detect potential fluctuations in politi-
cally-minded spending during the contentious 2016 cam-
paign. Some earlier studies of political consumerism
(Newman and Bartels, 2011; Copeland, 2014a) combined
self-reports of boycotts and buycotts into a single measure.
We will similarly collapse our survey responses to assess
the proportions of Americans who actively purchase or
decline to purchase products for political or social reasons,
but we also evaluate them separately, as we view them as
distinct actions based on punishment and reward, respec-
tively (Copeland, 2014b; Baek, 2010).
We run logistic regression models for each outcome
variable. Individuals who reported declining to buy a prod-
uct or service in the previous 12 months are coded dichoto-
mously as "1" and all other individuals are coded as "0."
An identical coding scheme is used for the buycott outcome
variable (1 = buycotted, 0 = did not). For the first half of our
analyses, our explanatory variables of interest are: party
identification, partisan intensity, ideological intensity,
political interest, political knowledge, and social media
activity.4 We also include a range of available control vari-
ables including: age (and age-squared), gender, race, edu-
cation, income, marital status, and voter registration status.
For the registered voter survey, we omit controls that were
unavailable (income, marital status, and political knowl-
edge) or not applicable (voter registration).
We designed our registered voter survey to enable us to
empirically test our expectations regarding expressive and
instrumental partisanship. In this survey, we included the
four-question partisan identity battery adopted from Huddy
etal. (2015) to create a scale ranging from "0" (low expres-
sive identity) to "1" (high expressive identity). This survey
also included questions about respondents' positions on
policies including abortion, gay marriage, immigration,
Obamacare, and the minimum wage, and responses were
used to construct a scale for instrumental partisanship on
which "0" represents someone who is neutral on all issues
or whose liberal and conservative issue positions cancel
each other out, and "1" represents someone who reported
the extreme liberal (conservative) position on each issue.
Patterns and determinants of
contemporary political consumerism
We begin by reporting and contextualizing the overall pat-
terns that emerge in our surveys and proceed to examine the
determinants of contemporary political consumerism in
America. Consistent with previous studies, we find that
political consumerism is commonplace in the United States.
Sizeable percentages across all three of our studies reported
boycotting and buycotting products or services because of
the social or political values of the company that provides
them, as shown in Table 1. In our January 2016 survey, 35%
of survey respondents reported that they participated in a
boycott and/or buycott during the previous 12 months.
Boycotting occurred more frequently than buycotting in this
and in all three of our surveys, 32% of respondents reported
boycotting compared to 22% who reported buycotting a
4 Research and Politics 
product or service. Both boycotting and buycotting were
more prevalent among registered voters, with 39% reporting
participating in a boycott and 27% in a buycott. The percent-
ages climbed as the culmination of the 2016 election
approached, based on our October survey, when a combined
40% of respondents reported boycotting (36%) and/or buy-
cotting (22%) a product. The rates increase slightly in this
survey when the analysis is restricted to registered voters
(39% boycotted; 24% buycotted). Frequencies rise further
during our April 2017 survey in which a combined 53% of
respondents indicated they had participated in a boycott
(50%) or buycott (30%) in the previous 12 months. Overall,
we detect hints that political consumerism may be on the
rise, both over time and over the period of our studies, but we
caution that additional, longitudinal research is necessary to
determine whether these patterns are solid or ephemeral.
Next, we proceed to assess the sociopolitical and demo-
graphic underpinnings of political-consumer behavior. We
run a series of logistic regression models for each survey to
better understand which individual-level characteristics are
related to political consumerism. Reported participation in
a boycott or a buycott in the previous year are separately
regressed on a variety of political variables including: par-
tisan identification, political knowledge, political interest,
partisan intensity, ideological intensity, and social media
activity as well as an array of demographic variables. We
also collapse political consumerism into a single, dichoto-
mous variable indicating participation in either a boycott or
buycott in the previous year as a function of the same politi-
cal and demographic variables.
Political knowledge, political interest, and ideological
intensity were significant predictors of all three outcome
variables (boycott, buycott, and the combined variable) in
each of the surveys we analyze. Individuals who demon-
strated greater knowledge about politics, who reported
higher levels of interest, and who placed themselves near
the extremes on the seven-point ideological scale were all
more likely to have reported engaging in political consum-
erism during the previous year. This is consistent with pre-
vious findings in the US and in other Western democracies
that placement on the political spectrum and an interest in
politics are closely related to political-consumer behavior
(Stolle and Micheletti, 2013). Although the social media
use variable was not available for all three studies, our
analyses of the CCES revealed, as expected, that social
media use was significantly correlated with political con-
sumerism across the board; higher levels of political activ-
ity on social media were, in fact, associated with higher
rates of participation in boycotts and buycotts, all else being
equal. This finding is generally consistent with social media
effects reported by Copeland and Becker (2016), although
social media activity in their study was denoted using indi-
cators for social media membership, discussion of LGBT
issues on social media, and using social media to meet
other LGBT people. By contrast, the constitutive compo-
nents of our measure of social media use are less restrictive
overall and incorporate items that focus on political activity
on social media. The results we report also speak to the
broader generalizability of social media effects, given
Copeland and Becker's (2016) analyses were based on a
specialized sample restricted to LGBT individuals. Finally,
we note that our original results overall remain robust to the
inclusion of the measure of social media use.
Our findings on political orientation are comparable to
some prior studies that found left-leaning individuals par-
ticipated in boycotts and buycotts at higher rates than con-
servatives (Stolle and Micheletti, 2013), but somewhat
contrast with other studies that reported individuals who
engaged in buycotts were more likely to identify as
Republican and conservative whereas individuals who
participated in boycotts more frequently identified as
Democrats and liberal (Baek, 2010). Since we are exclu-
sively investigating political consumerism in the United
States, we folded ideological self-placement to represent
ideological intensity and included indicator variables for
party identification. In addition to significant findings for
ideological intensity, Republicans were less likely to report
participating in a boycott compared to Democrats; the dif-
ferences are statistically significant (p < .05, two-tailed) in
both the January 2016 and April 2017 surveys, as shown in
Table 2.5 Republicans also reported buycotting a product
or service in the previous year at lower rates than
Democrats, as shown in Table 3, a difference that was only
significant in the January 2016 survey. It is conceivable
these patterns reflect the influence of partisan reactions to
Donald Trump and the idiosyncratic nature of the 2016
presidential election, but additional research is needed to
determine whether these effects persist. Nevertheless,

research by Copeland and Becker (2017) has also shown
that Democrats were significantly more likely to have boy-
cotted Trump family brands during the 2016 election.
Strength of partisanship, on the other hand, was marginally
statistically significant in our April 2017 survey, in which
partisan intensity was significantly related (p < .10, two-
tailed) to having participated in a boycott.
The relationships between demographic variables and
political consumerism were generally insignificant and
often inconsistent across surveys, particularly with regard
to age and race. Individuals who were not registered were
significantly less likely to have reported boycotting and
buycotting in the ANES survey, but voter registration was
not significant and was in the opposite direction for boy-
cotting and the combined variable in the CCES. Neither
income nor marital status were significantly related to
either boycotts or buycotts. Consistent with prior research
that finds women to be more frequent political consumers
in almost all countries except the United States (Stolle and
Micheletti, 2013), significant gender differences rarely
emerged in our surveys. Gender was only significant for the
combined boycott/buycott variable in the April 2017 sur-
vey (see Table 4), in which women were more likely to
have reported participating in political-consumer behavior.
Overall, race and age were generally insignificantly related
to political-consumer behavior.
Political consumerism as political
expression: Assessing the role
of expressive and instrumental
partisanship
Next we narrow our focus to Democrats and Republicans to
examine the impact of expressive and instrumental parti-
sanship on political consumerism. Overall, we find strong
evidence that both expressive and instrumental aspects of
partisanship are related to political consumerism.Across all
three models, our measure of instrumental partisanship is
statistically significant (p < .05, two-tailed). Expressive
partisan identity, on the other hand, has a positive and sta-
tistically significant association with boycotting and the
combined boycott/buycott outcome variable, suggesting
that individuals with a strong expressive identity may be
more inclined to punish brands that oppose their party than
to reward brands that support their party. We note that
expressive partisan identity appears to have a substantively
similar (positive) impact on buycotting behavior, but the
effect is not statistically significant at conventional levels.

Additional evidence is necessary to ascertain definitively
whether expressive partisanship is reliably associated with
buycott choices.6
To assess the relative impact of instrumental partisanship
and expressive partisan identity on political consumerism,
we used the estimates for the uncollapsed models above
(Table 5, columns 1 and 2) to calculate the predicted proba-
bilities of participating in boycotts and buycotts for each
component of partisanship. On average, a one standard
deviation increase on the instrumental partisanship scale,
approximately 0.33, corresponds to an increase in the prob-
ability of participation in a boycott during the preceding
year by 0.142 (p = .000) and raises the probability of partici-
pating in a buycott by 0.09 (p = .004), holding all other vari-
ables constant. Similarly, a one standard deviation increase
on the expressive partisanship scale, approximately 0.21,
corresponds to an increase in the predicted probability of
having boycotted by 0.06 (p = .029) and buycotting by 0.04
(p = .146 ). We conclude from these analyses that instru-
mental partisanship likely has a modestly stronger, although,
in our view, comparable, substantive impact on political
consumerism, relative to expressive partisan identity. 7
Conclusion
Large percentages of Americans participate in boycotts and
buycotts for political reasons. These rates varied across our
three surveys conducted over a sixteen-month period in the
United States, with the portion who reported partaking in
political-consumer behavior rising in each successive sur-
vey. Political knowledge, political interest, and ideological
intensity are all closely related to participation in political-
consumer behavior. In two of the three surveys we analyze,
Republicans reported engaging in political-consumer behav-
ior at lower rates than Democrats. Narrowing our focus to
partisans, we show that both expressive and instrumental
partisanship are associated with political-consumer behavior.
Individuals withstrongexpressivepartisanidentities reported
boycotting at higher rates than individuals with weaker iden-
tities. Instrumental partisanship was a significant predictor of
both boycotts and buycotts, with partisans who held more
consistent policy positions reporting higher rates of partici-
pation in recent boycotts and buycotts compared to those
who held less consistent positions.
The fluctuations in participation in boycotts and/or buy-
cotts for political reasons between our surveys as well as
the relationship between political consumerism and instru-
mental and expressive partisanship suggests that context
matters. Individuals who failed to engage in political con-
sumerism during the past year could still be triggered to
participate if exposed to the relevant information connect-
ing the politics of brands with their own political predispo-
sitions. Instrumental partisanship should be most relevant
when calls to boycott or buycott emphasize policy issues.
Americans with strong expressive partisan identities are
likely to respond to political information, such as cam-
paign contributions and endorsements. Our findings sug-
gest that expressive partisanship may be more closely
associated with punishing companies for actions that sup-
port the opposition through boycotts rather than rewarding
them for activities that support their own party, results that
are consistent with studies that find anger or threat can
motivate action based on partisan identity (see Miller and
Conover, 2015).
The implications of the analyses we report are poten-
tially significant. In an era characterized by heightened par-
tisan polarization, political views and preferences may
increasingly find expression in individuals' consumer pref-
erences and behavior.Additionally, the recent U.S. Supreme
Court ruling in Citizens United v. FEC that enables corpo-
rations to engage directly in electioneering has already
opened the floodgates for increased corporate political

activity, a trend with no realistic end in sight barring further
legal or legislative action. Our research suggests individu-
als will be responsive to these activities, a finding that may
(or may not) affect corporate calculations about the risks or
opportunities associated with overt political involvement.
Other contextual developments seem to be influential
as well. Our results reinforce the notion that social media
use affects and, as Copeland and Becker (2016) argue,
likely facilitates political consumerism, a finding whose
implications are potent given social media's capacity to
transform the sociopolitical landscape and to extend indi-
viduals' interpersonal networks. These changes may influ-
ence citizens' consumer reactions in meaningful ways. As
access to information about the politics of corporations
becomes more widespread, for instance, the relationship
between expressive partisanship and consumer behavior
may grow even stronger. The heightened scrutiny of cor-
porate political activity facilitated by near-constant cover-
age of such activities, transparency in the form of
immediate disclosure of at least some of these activities,
and the capacity for instantaneous awareness building and
mobilization afforded by social and other media suggest
the distinctions between consumer and political expres-
sions and behavior may be eroding. In light of these devel-
opments, we also believe it is useful to continually monitor
the social and attitudinal underpinnings of political con-
sumerism to track ways in which these may change over
time and in different circumstances. The current study
aims to take a step in this direction.

Notes
1. Approximately one-in-five Americans reported boycotting
in the mid-1990s (Stolle and Micheletti, 2013) and in 2005
(Newman and Bartels, 2016), compared to at least one-in-
three and as many as half in our surveys (see Table 1).
2. See the online appendix for additional information about
each survey including where to obtain information about the
sampling and design features of the ANES and CCES.
3. We acknowledge that respondents may (or may not) have
interpreted primes about companies' "social and political
values" to be explicitly linked to partisan politics; instead,
it is conceivable that these items conjured up considera-
tions about corporations' activities and reputations regarding
things such as sweatshop labor, animal cruelty or the envi-
ronment, for example.
4. The "social media use" variable was constructed as an
additive index denoting the number of political activities
respondents reported engaging in on social media (posted
about politics, commented about politics, read about politics,
followed a political event, or forwarded something politi-
cal). This variable is only available on the CCES, so analyses
that incorporate social media use as a predictor are restricted
to this survey. Unfortunately, other variables used in prior
studies were unavailable, including: political distrust, gen-
eral discontent, civic initiative, civic duty, and individualized
activism (Newman and Bartels, 2011).
5. As an anonymous reviewer pointed out, the difference
between Democrats and Republicans could be attributed to
Democrats interpreting actions regarding the environment,
animal rights, etc. as political more so than Republicans.
While a goal of this study is to identify attributes related to
boycotting and buycotting for political reasons, some may
consider any boycott or buycott to be political.
6. Additional tables displaying alternative approaches are
available in the online appendix. For example, we substitute
an indicator variable for strong partisans for the expressive
partisanship variable and also estimate a model that includes
both the expressive partisanship variable and the indicator
variable. In all cases, instrumental partisanship is still sig-
nificantly associated with self-reports of participation in boy-
cotts and buycotts during the previous year.
7. Substantively similar conclusions can be reached when we
compare standardized coefficients to assess the relative effects
of instrumental partisanship and expressive partisan identity
on political consumerism. Details available upon request.
