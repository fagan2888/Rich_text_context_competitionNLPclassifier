Many students experience difficulties when reading informa-
tional text (Duke, Bennett-Armistead, & Roberts, 2002;
Purcell-Gates, Duke, & Martineau, 2007). And, although
basal reading texts in the early grades primarily use literary
text to teach the basic strategies and procedures needed for
learning to read (Kletzien & Dreher, 2004; Stephens, 2007),
most academic achievement depends, in part, on the ability
to read and write informational text (Duke, 2004; Hall &
Sabey, 2007). Furthermore, as beginning readers are taught
to read with primarily literary text (Kletzien & Dreher, 2004),
they may be unprepared for the challenges of informational
text and content-specific vocabulary (Sanacore & Palumbo,
2009). This is especially evident in the fourth grade, where
there is a marked increase in student interaction with content
area materials (McNamara, Ozuru, & Floyd, 2011; Meyer &
Ray, 2011). Researchers have dubbed this the "fourth grade
slump," and attribute it to difficulties with informational text
(Biancarosa & Snow, 2006; Chall & Jacobs, 2003; Sanacore
& Palumbo, 2009).
One major challenge facing researchers and practitioners
is the lack of a unified definition of informational text
(Williams, 2009). Those using the term may define it in a
variety of ways (Duke, 2004; Marinak & Gambrell, 2008;
Moss & Newton, 2002). Using this term as a synonym for
nonfiction is confusing given that many informational texts
are nonfiction, but not all nonfiction texts are necessarily
considered to be informational texts. According to Duke
(2004), text that conveys information about the natural and
social world could be considered informational text, while
Marinak and Gambrell (2008) suggested that informational
text be typified as any type of written material that is designed
to convey any kind of information, such as books, maga-
zines, newspapers, brochures, and technological resources,
such as websites. Organizations also have different defini-
tions and understandings of the term: The National Council
of Teachers of English (NCTE; 2011) and the International
ReadingAssociation (IRA; 2012) group informational text in
the nonfiction genre. The American Library Association
(ALA) describes informational text as books that are written
and illustrated to present, organize, and interpret document-
able, factual material (American Association of School
Librarians [AASL], 2011). According to the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), texts are either
literary or informational (National Assessment Governing

Informational Text and the Common
Core: A Content Analysis of Three Basal
Reading Programs
Barbara A. Braker-Walters1
Abstract
The informational text recommendations found in the Common Core State Standards for English and Language Arts (CCSS-
ELA) will have a significant impact on teacher practice and student learning in the classroom. Teachers will be required to
integrate substantial amounts of informational text instruction into reading curriculum. This article describes the findings of a
quantitative content analysis study of the text genres contained in the three commercially published fourth-grade basal reading
texts. Hand coding was used to analyze the types and extent of text contained in each publisher's text and then compare
with the recommendation of the CCSS-ELA. Findings indicated that the percentage of informational text found in the three
selected fourth-grade basal readers does not meet the informational text standard set by the CCSS-ELA. These results are
significant due to the recent adoption by most states of the CCSS, which are based on the 2009 National Assessment of
Educational Progress (NAEP). As most elementary classrooms rely on basal texts for reading and language arts instruction,
it is important for principals, curriculum leaders, and teachers to be aware of the volume and type of informational texts
that appear in basal texts at each grade level. School districts and teachers may need to purchase supplementary materials to
address the standard set for informational text set by the CCSS-ELA.

2 SAGE Open
Board [NAGB], 2008). Educators need to be aware that the
Common Core State Standards (CCSS) uses the definition of
informational text found in the NAEP framework (National
GovernorsAssociation Center for Best Practices and Council
of Chief State School Officers [NGA Center and CCSSO],
2010a). This is important when interpreting research, as the
definition is not always used in the same way across
studies.
Children's use of informational text increases as they
advance through school (Hall & Sabey, 2007; Jeong, Gaffney,
& Choi, 2010). Much of the reading that students will
encounter in later grades, and continue to negotiate during
life, is of an informational nature (Baker et al., 2011; Brozo,
2010; Heider, 2009). Although narrative text comprises a
major proportion of the materials children encounter during
reading instruction (Jeong et al., 2010; Moss, 2008; Ness,
2011), a major predictor of overall student achievement is
the skillful use of literacy strategies during content area read-
ing (Vacca et al., 2009). It has been determined that the per-
centage of informational text found in standardized tests can
be as high as 70% to 80% (Sanacore & Palumbo, 2009).
Consequently, students who have little experience with
informational text are likely to score lower on standardized
achievement tests (Heider, 2009).
The Common Core State Standards for English and
Language Arts (CCSS-ELA) will have a significant effect on
what teachers teach and what primary students are expected
to be able to read (Bomer & Maloch, 2011). According to the
CCSS-ELA, by the end of fourth grade, reading experiences
should be evenly balanced between literary text and informa-
tional text (NGA Center and CCSSO, 2010b). In addition,
instruction for acquiring the skills needed to comprehend
informational text in the content areas must be incorporated
into the reading and language arts curriculum starting in the
second grade (NGA Center and CCSSO, 2010b). Although
Moss (2008) found that nonfiction text was represented in
about 40% of the total text found in two California basal
reading series, only 50% of nonfiction text selections were
informational, which amounted to only 20% of the overall
text. A more recent study conducted by Yopp and Yopp
(2012) revealed that narrative text constituted 77% of the
books that were read aloud to preschool to Grade 3 children,
whereas only 8% were described as informational text. Jeong
et al. (2010) found that third- and fourth-grade students aver-
aged only 16 minutes per day of informational text use in the
classroom. Finally, it has been reported that only 33% of
classroom libraries contain informational text (Ness, 2011).
This evidence suggests that student exposure to informa-
tional text is lacking in most classrooms.
Research has determined that the volume of text and
opportunities to read significantly predict text comprehension
(Brenner & Hiebert, 2010). However, the concept of reading
volume is more complex than simple tabulations of the num-
ber of words contained in text. Allington (2009) suggested
that mastery of specific skills (such as identifying the number
of syllables in a word or reciting phonics generalizations) did
not necessarily lead to fluency and comprehension skill in
reading.After reviewing research, Hiebert and Martin (2009)
postulated that reading volume is affected by variables such
as text complexity, instructional context, and students' read-
ing engagement or interest. In addition, the CCSS-ELA spe-
cifically addresses students'ability to read increasingly more
complex text; explicit guidelines are included in the form of
quantitative indices inAppendixAand in the listing of exam-
ple texts in Appendix B (NGA Center and CCSSO, 2010b).
Hiebert (2013) suggested that when students get "easier"
texts, these texts are often simply shorter in length and not
substantially different in the load of vocabulary. As informa-
tional text can contain graphs, diagrams, and other illustra-
tive renderings (NGA Center and CCSSO, 2010b), it is
impossible to determine exposure to reading volume by cal-
culating word count.
According to Education Market Research (2012), approx-
imately 84% of American teachers use basal reading pro-
grams for classroom instruction. Moreover, studies have
estimated that 80% to 90% of elementary teachers predomi-
nately depend on basal readers, its accompanying work-
books, and other commercially prepared ancillary materials
as a literacy instruction (Stephens, 2007). Three major text-
book companies, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Macmillan/
McGraw-Hill, and Pearson Scott Foresman, publish the most
widely purchased basal reading programs in the United
States. These companies represent 83% of the overall U.S.
sales for the elementary market in basal reading textbooks
(Education Market Research, 2012).
As many teachers may need to change their curriculum
and adjust instruction to meet the informational text recom-
mendations as defined by the CCSS-ELA, they need to be
aware of the types and extent of informational text found in
newly published basal reading texts to align curriculum and
instruction to meet the defined fourth-grade informational
text recommendations of the CCSS-ELA (NGA Center and
CCSSO, 2010b; Shanahan, Fisher, & Frey, 2012). Examining
the contents of basal reading texts is one means of under-
standing the extent to which students are exposed to informa-
tional text during reading instruction.
Method
The method of quantitative content analysis was used in this
study (Krippendorff, 2012; Neuendorf, 2002). In this study,
data were gathered from 3 fourth-grade basal reading text-
books: (a) Journeys, published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt
(2012); (b) Treasures, published by Macmillan/McGraw-
Hill (2011); and (c) Reading Street, published by Pearson
Scott Foresman (2011). These documents are published texts
and are publicly available.
The percentage of informational text, as defined by the
CCSS-ELA (NGA Center and CCSSO, 2010b), was exam-
ined within each basal reading text using procedures of
Braker-Walters 3
quantitative content analysis. The results were subdivided
according to three categories: (a) genre (informational or
literary), (b) type of text (fiction, literary nonfiction,
poetry, informational text, argumentative or persuasive
text, and procedural text or documents), and (c) publisher
(Journeys, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011; Treasures,
Macmillan/McGraw-Hill, 2011; and Reading Street, Scott
Foresman, 2012). The percentages of text type for each
category were reported to display differences based on
genre, type of text, and textbook publisher. Data were col-
lected using Krippendorff's (1980) structure for collection
and analysis, and were coded by two individuals to ensure
reliability.
This study utilized "hand coding," where one actually
reads the text passages to critically understand and think
about the text before coding. While computer analysis is use-
ful for working with structure, human coders are more capa-
ble of assigning meaning and establishing relations between
text features (Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2011). For these
reasons, hand coding was the most valid method of collect-
ing data for this study, allowing for effective analysis of the
informational text categorical content that aligned with the
definitions of the CCSS-ELA (NGA Center and CCSSO,
2010b).
Materials
The codebook and coding form used in this study were
developed prior to the data gathering, following procedures
developed by Flood and Lapp (1986) and Moss (2008), and
most recently utilized by Watkins (2010; see Appendix A).
The codebook contained detailed procedures for coding each
text selection, detailed descriptions of each variable, and
step-by-step instructions of the coding process (seeAppendix
A). The coding form acted as an organizational tool for
recording data, and encompassed the following categories:
publisher, title and author of selection, start page, number of
pages, and text type classification (see Appendix B). Using
the coding form, the text types and the percentage of each
type contained in each publisher's basal student textbook
were calculated and presented as a table. Then, the overall
totals were used to compare each publisher with CCSS-ELA
recommendations (NGA Center and CCSSO, 2010b).
Many basal text publishers advertise on their respective
websites that their basal reader materials adhere to the CCSS
(Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011; Macmillan/McGraw-Hill,
2011; Pearson Scott Foresman, 2012). Selections that appear
only in the teacher's manuals or in ancillary resources may be
included in this claim. While selections from these materials
may be presented during classroom instruction, they were not
included in this study because they were not presented as
inclusionary text in the main student basal reader. Because of
this, only selections that appeared in the main student text-
book, directed to all learners, were analyzed and coded.
Procedures
To enhance the levels of reliability, this study assessed inter-
coder reliability, using a full sample, during the pilot. Pilot
coding was conducted to train the coder with the coding sys-
tem. The coding method was calibrated to stabilize the cod-
ers' techniques, so that the coders viewed the content in the
same way without discussion or collaboration. Consensus
was reviewed during training and piloting, and revisions
were made before final coding commenced. As blind coding,
in which coders are unaware of the research questions or
hypothesis that guide the investigation, is preferable to
reduce bias (Neuendorf, 2002), the coder in this study under-
stood the categories and measures, but was not informed of
the purpose of the study. In addition, as human text coding
works best with hard copies of text (Saldana, 2013), only
hard copies of the textbooks were analyzed in this study.
In this study, a pilot study was conducted prior to com-
mencing data collection. During the pilot, identical copies of
the fourth-grade edition of Harcourt Trophies (2003) were
used to assess intercoder reliability. Forty selections were
examined, and Krippendorff's alpha was used to measure the
reliability coefficients between coders. Interrater reliability
was determined to be .94. Therefore, the reliability of the
coders was deemed acceptable to continue with the main
study.
Data concerning the text types and percentage of total text
were collected during the main study by examining and hand
coding the text selections. Coders categorized each variable
and referenced where each recording unit was found.
Definitions of units, including procedures for identifying
them, were established according to the definition of infor-
mational text types found in the CCSS-ELA (NGA Center
and CCSSO, 2010b). The data were hand coded as software
programs do not accurately quantify text by genre (Saldana,
2013). In addition, given that historical fiction and poetry are
not included by the CCSS-ELA in this genre, the coders may
need to revisit text selections to confirm adherence to speci-
fications of the CCSS-ELA's informational text definition
(NGA Center and CCSSO, 2010b).
Two measures were used to determine the percentage of
informational text found in each grade-level text. The first
classified text by genre; the second calculated the number of
pages devoted to each genre. Text genre was coded and data
were collected according to the CCSS-ELA definition of text
types (NGA Center and CCSSO, 2010b). The number of
instances each text type appeared and the total number of
pages for each text type were tabulated according to pub-
lisher. The volume of total text presented, as opposed to the
number of stories, provided in basal readers is significantly
related to the amount students have to read (Brenner &
Hiebert, 2010). As informational text can contain graphs,
diagrams, and other illustrative renderings that present infor-
mation, determining the number of pages devoted to

informational text provides an accurate description of the
extent of informational text presented to students.
A matrix listing the types of informational text was devel-
oped and used to record the types of genres and the percent-
age of text. The number of instances each genre appeared
and the total number of pages for each genre selection were
coded and calculated according to publisher.
The observed frequency in each category was reported
and compared for significant differences in the expected fre-
quencies for each publisher using a chi-square goodness-
of-fit test. A chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used to test
the association between the null hypotheses from which the
data sample was drawn to the hypothesized distribution. The
difference between the observed frequency distributions was
reviewed to determine statistical significance.
Data collection occurred during the examination and cod-
ing of text selections presented in the three most widely pub-
lished 2011-2012 fourth-grade basal reading texts. Text
selections were restricted to actual student reading selections
listed in the table of contents of each text. After the basal
texts were coded, information from the coding forms was
transferred to the database and tabulated. Final calculations
were used to determine the percentage of informational text
found at the fourth-grade level for each type of informational
text (expository, argumentative or persuasive texts, and pro-
cedural texts or documents) and for each of the three text-
books. The percentages of text types for each category were
reported, with tables to display differences based on type of
text and textbook publisher.
Results
Although the percentage of genre selections was fairly con-
sistent across publishers, results indicated that the total num-
ber of text selections varied among publishers. Overall,
Macmillan/McGraw-Hill Treasures contained the highest
number of selections, whereas Houghton Mifflin Harcourt
Journeys had the least number of selections (see Table 1).
However, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Journeys devoted the
largest percentage of text selections to literary text, whereas
Macmillan/McGraw-Hill Treasures (2011) contained the
largest percentage of informational text selections. This
finding is similar to previous studies that found differences
in the number of text selections across publishers (Moss,
2008; Stephens, 2007).
Number of text pages. The percentage of text pages devoted
to the different text genres was also fairly consistent between
the three publishers. However, the total number of text pages
varied among publishers (see Table 2). Overall, Macmillan/
McGraw-Hill Treasures contained the most text pages with a
total of 587 pages. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Journeys,
with 492 pages, had the least number of text pages. In con-
trast, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Journeys devoted the larg-
est percentage of text pages to literary text, whereas Pearson
Scott Foresman Reading Street (2011) contained the smallest
percentage of literary text pages.
Results from the frequencies and percentages of text
selections (see Table 3) show that basal readers contain a
greater number of literary text selections (fiction, nonfiction,
and poetry) compared with informational text selections
(expository, argumentative or persuasive, and procedural
text or documents). This finding is consistent with the results
of previous studies, which indicated that literary text com-
prises a major proportion of the materials children encounter
during reading instruction (Jeong et al., 2010; Moss, 2008;
Ness, 2011).
While the CCSS-ELA recommends 50% of the text stu-
dents are exposed to be of the informational genre, the basal

readers examined in this study averaged only 31% of overall
text selections, which amounted to approximately 16% of the
overall number of pages (see Table 3).
Discussion
The data in this study indicated that the percentage of infor-
mational text, as defined by the CCSS-ELA (NGA Center
and CCSSO, 2010b), found in each of the fourth-grade basal
reading textbooks is less than the standard set by the CCSS-
ELA. While the CCSS-ELA suggests that informational text
must constitute 50% of the text that students are to read at the
fourth-grade level, these basal readers contained an average
of 31% of selections devoted to informational text. In addi-
tion, the number of pages devoted to informational text
ranged from 14% to 18% across publishers. This current
finding is distressing as many teachers depend on basal read-
ers as a primary instructional resource for teaching reading.
As a result, the selection of a basal reading program can be
compared with choosing a reading curriculum. Consequently,
choosing a reading program that does not meet the bench-
marks specified by the CCSS-ELA could inhibit student
learning by denying them the opportunity to experience the
text types needed for college and career readiness.
Potential limitations may affect the interpretation of the
results of this study. One potential limitation deals with the
text selections that were presented in the main student text
and listed in the table of contents. Uncategorized segments
of text that were not listed in the student basal table of con-
tents, including study guides and extension activities, were
not included in the analysis. In addition, selections that
appeared in the teacher's manuals, but were not contained in
the main student text, were not included in the analysis.
Although these selections may be presented during class-
room instruction, they were not examined because they were
not offered as specific inclusionary text in the main student
basal reader.
In addition, the determination of text length of the selec-
tions could impair the interpretation of the results. While
word count may have provided a more accurate understand-
ing of the reading volume for each text selection, this total
would not take into account font size, picture size, margin
width, pacing, or complexity. As the CCSS-ELA specifies
that informational text can contain graphs, diagrams, and
other illustrative renderings (NGA Center and CCSSO,
2010b), determining the number of pages devoted to infor-
mational text more accurately answered the research
questions.
Conclusion
The CCSS-ELA requires the integration of a substantial
amount of informational text into curricula to ensure that
students are prepared to meet the requirements of college and
career readiness (Porter, McMaken, Hwang, & Yang, 2011).
As instruction in the use of informational text rarely occurs
during content area lessons, instructing students on how to
read these texts often becomes the responsibility of the class-
room reading teacher (Lenski, 2011).
Basal readers play a central role in preparing students for
the types of texts they will encounter as they move through
school (Brenner & Hiebert, 2010). This study analyzed the
amount of informational text found in the three most widely
purchased, commercially published fourth-grade basal read-
ing texts. The percentage of informational text, as defined by
the CCSS-ELA (NGA Center and CCSSO, 2010b), was
examined within each basal reading text using procedures of
quantitative content analysis. The results suggest that the
newly published basal readers contain an unbalanced amount
of literary versus informational text. To make effective
instructional decisions regarding reading curriculum, it is
imperative for principals, curriculum leaders, and teachers to
be aware of the amount of informational text that appears in
fourth-grade basal reading texts. Findings from this study
will allow practitioners to make effective instructional deci-
sions regarding reading curriculum, including the purchase
of basal ancillary materials or supplemental texts that con-
tain the necessary amount of informational text.
The data results of this study also indicated differences in
the number of text selections presented in basal readers as
well as the number of pages of total text presented. These are
significant findings that can be associated with the amount of
reading experiences presented to students during classroom
instruction. As text can contain graphs, diagrams, and other
illustrative renderings, the number of pages devoted to spe-
cific text genre provides an accurate description of the vol-
ume of informational text presented to students. Previous
research determined that the volume of text in basal readers
is significantly related to the amount students have to read
and interact with text (Brenner & Hiebert, 2010).
Future research might include examination of all text
associated with a student basal reading series. Different
types of text genre may be presented throughout the book
that is not listed in the table of contents. For example,
Pearson Scott Foresman Reading Street (2012) had a great
deal of informational text that was presented as review
throughout the text. However, as these review pages were
not included in the table of contents, they were not counted
as a text selection or totaled into the number of pages. In
addition, some publishers may include text found in ancil-
lary materials as contributing to the overall totals of text
genre exposure. Examining all materials that are associated
with a basal reading series may affect the amount of text that
is presented to students.
Future studies might also be conducted to (a) compare the
amount of genre types found in basal readers with
6 SAGE Open
standardized reading tests and (b) examine the amount of
genre types found in standardized tests to the Common Core
Standards recommendations. As part of the Race to the Top
program, the U.S. Department of Education (2012) has
authorized the development of new standardized tests to be
aligned with the Common Core Standards. These tests are
scheduled to be released during the 2014-2015 school year,
with testing to be conducted annually on students from third
grade through high school. If schools are using basal reading
programs for the majority of reading instruction, teachers
need to be cognizant of the types and amounts of text genres
that students will be expected to understand.
In conclusion, research has shown that as students prog-
ress through grade levels, they are expected to comprehend
and learn from an increasing amount of informational text
(Baker et al., 2011; White, Chen, & Forsyth, 2010). Thus,
skill in utilizing informational text is critical to achievement
in school and beyond (Kraemer, McCabe, & Sinatra, 2012).
As approximately 84% of American teachers utilize a com-
mercially prepared basal reading series for classroom read-
ing instruction (Dewitz, Jones, & Leahy, 2009; Education
Market Research, 2012), it is imperative that school admin-
istrators, teachers, and other educational stakeholders
closely examine basal student reading texts to verify the
amount and type of informational text. School districts and
teachers may need to purchase basal ancillary materials or
supplementary texts to address the standard set for informa-
tional text set by the CCSS-ELA (NGA Center and CCSSO,
2010b).

Codebook
Procedure for coding text selections for text type and content
area
1. Locate the table of contents. Identify the text selec-
tions that are listed in this table of contents. Only the
text selections listed in the table of contents should be
coded.
2. Prior to reading the text selection, record the publish-
er's name, grade level, title and author of the selec-
tion, and the start page number of the selection. The
start page number is the page where the title appears.
3. Count the total number of pages for the selection,
including the title page. Pictures, photos, charts, etc.
should be included in page number count. Pre- and
postreading information and end-of-text questions
should not be included. Include half-pages in total
count.
4. Read the selection in its entirety.
5. Categorize the text selection according to the text
type definitions described below. Sidebars should not
be included when determining the text type. When
multiple text types are included, categorize the text
according to the majority text type.
Definitions of categories
Publisher/series: The publisher and series name of the
text.
Title/author: The title and author(s) last name(s) of the
selection.
Start page: The page number of the first page of the selec-
tion. This is usually the title page of the selection.
Number of pages: The total number of pages, including
photos, illustrations, and graphical representations. This
may include half-pages in total. Prereading information
and end-of-text questions should not be included.
