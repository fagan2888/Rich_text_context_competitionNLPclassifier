Abstract: Little is known about national trends in sexual behavior
among MSM in the US. Data from the 2002 and 2006­2010
National Survey of Family Growth were used to compare sexual
behaviors of sexually active MSM. Mean number of recent male
partners significantly decreased from 2.9 in 2002 to 2.1 in 2006­
2010 (P = 0.027), particularly among young MSM. Other sexual risk
behaviors did not change or decrease over time. Our findings that
sexual risk decreased as HIV and syphilis increased among MSM
suggest that factors in addition to individual-level sexual risk should
also be examined in relation to recent disease increases.

INTRODUCTION
There have been recent increases in HIV and primary
and secondary (P&S) syphilis among men who have sex with
men (MSM), especially among young or minority MSM, in
the United States.1,2 From 2006 to 2009, estimated HIV inci-
dence increased 35% among MSM 13­29 year olds and 48%
among black MSM 13­29 year olds.1 Similarly, from 2005 to
2008, rates of reported P&S syphilis increased 74% among
black MSM (adjusted for age and region of the United States),
and 160% and 117% among 15­19 and 20­24 year olds,
respectively (adjusted for age, region, and race or ethnicity).2
Furthermore, analysis of trends in HIV and P&S syphilis from
2004 to 2008 found that increases among black men 13­24
year olds were identified in nearly all parts of the United
States included in the study, indicating that the increase was
widespread rather than limited to a few areas.3 For both dis-
eases, it is possible that increases among MSM began earlier.
From 2000 to 2004, P&S syphilis increased 81% among men
(believed to be driven by MSM),4 and HIV/AIDS cases
seemed to increase in 2004 among MSM.5
Although studies have examined temporal trends in
sexual behaviors among MSM before and after highly active
antiretroviral therapy and in the late 1990s and early 2000s,6­9
few studies have examined recent behavioral trends in MSM
in the United States. One study, a random digit dialing survey
in Seattle, compared the sexual behavior of MSM from 2003
to 2006 and found a significant decrease in median number of
sex partners in the past year over time and no change in
unprotected anal intercourse.10 However, given the wide-
spread increases in HIV and P&S syphilis in the United
States, national data on temporal trends in the sexual behav-
iors of MSM are needed. To date, there has been a lack of
data from national population-based surveys that include
MSM. The purpose of this study was to examine nationally
representative data on sexually active MSM to determine if
behaviors changed recently while P&S syphilis and HIV
increased among MSM.
METHODS
We used data from the 2002 and 2006­2010 National
Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). NSFG is a multistage
national probability sample of 15­44 year olds living in US
households, with over-samples of 15­24 year olds, blacks,
and Hispanics. Detailed information on the survey design
and sampling procedures has been previously described11,12;
however, in 2006, NSFG switched from periodic administra-
tion (ie, conducting the survey every 3­7 years) to continuous
administration (ie, conducting interviews from June 2006 to
June 2010). The same primary sampling units were used in
2002 and 2006­2010. The sample sizes and response rates for
males were 4928 (78%) in 2002 and 10,403 (75%) in 2006­
2010.13,14 All questions about same-sex partners and sexual
risk included in this analysis were collected via audio com-
puter assisted self-interview.
We used SAS-callable SUDAAN (release 10.0,
Research Triangle Institute, Durham, NC) for analyses, to
account for the complex sampling procedures used by NSFG,
and data were weighted for nonresponse. For men who
reported one or more male anal and/or oral sex partners in the
12 months before interview (referred to as "sexually active
MSM"), we used t tests to compare mean number of male sex

or more partners) across time by demographics, including
age, race/ethnicity, household income as related to federal
poverty level, education, and residing in a metropolitan sta-
tistical area. Additionally, we used x2 tests to compare re-
ported sexual risk behaviors [specific sexually transmitted
disease (STD)/HIV risk behaviors, including those with male
partners], sex with female partners, and STD/HIV testing
across time.
RESULTS
The percentage of men who reported having a male sex
partner in the past 12 months did not differ across time with
2.7% (n = 197) of all men categorized as sexually active
MSM in 2002 and 2.1% (n = 272) in 2006­2010
(P = 0.103); thus, there were an estimated population total
of 1.3­1.7 million sexually active MSM aged 15­44 years in
the United States during the survey years (Table 1). Among
all sexually active MSM, there was a significant decrease
across time in the reported number of male partners in the
past 12 months with an average of 2.9 partners in 2002 and 2.3
in 2006­2010 (P = 0.035). This decreasing trend was also
identified among sexually active 15- to 24-year old MSM
(2.9 partners in 2002 to 2.1 in 2006­2010, P = 0.027), and
there was a nonsignificant decreasing trend for 35­44 year olds
(P = 0.072). Also, there were no significant differences in the
average number of male partners reported by any racial or
ethnic group (Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic
black) across time.
We found significant decreases in number of male
partners in the past 12 months for some subpopulations.
Specifically, sexually active MSM with an income less than
150% of the federal poverty level reported a mean of 3.0 male
partners in 2002 significantly decreasing to 2.1 male partners in
2006­2010 (P = 0.032). Additionally, mean number of partners
decreased for sexually active MSM with some college experi-
ence from 3.2 in 2002 to 2.3 in 2006­2010 (P = 0.033) and, for
those living in a metropolitan statistical area, other than a central
city, from 3.2 in 2002 to 2.1 in 2006­2010 (P = 0.009). There
were no changes over time for the remaining subpopulations by
income, education, or residence.

Similarly, we found no changes over time or declines in
several STD/HIV risk behaviors (past 12 months) and STD/HIV
testing (past 12 months or lifetime). Specifically, there was no
significant difference across time in sexually active MSM who
reported spending time in jail, not using a condom at last sex,
injection drug use (IDU) and/or sex with a male IDU, or sex
with an HIV-infected male (Table 2). In both time frames, more
than half of sexually active MSM (56.7% in 2002 and 58.3% in
2006­2010) reported that they did not use a condom at last sex
with a male partner. We found a significant decrease in reports
of exchanging sex with a male for money or drugs from 15.1%
in 2002 to 3.1% in 2006­2010 (P = 0.002). Additionally, there
were no differences in reports of STD testing in the past 12
months (P = 0.945) or in receipt of last HIV test (P = 0.319).
Finally, there was a significant decrease in sexually
active MSM who reported a female partner in the past

12 months (MSMW) from 38.4% in 2002 to 24.8% in 2006­
2010 (P = 0.027). MSMW were 1.0% (2002) to 0.5% (2006­
2010) of all men (P = 0.004) with an estimated population
total of 315,642 MSMW in 2006­2010. Although we found
a significant decrease in condom use at last sex among MSMW
(P = 0.039), the decrease in overall numbers of MSMW meant
that there were significantly fewer MSMW who did not use
a condom at last sex, down from 292,114 in 2002 to 210,930 in
2006­2010. Among MSMW, reports of sex with an at-risk
female (exchange sex, IDU, or HIV-positive) in the past 12
months significantly declined from 32.1% in 2002 to 11.0% in
2006­2010 (P = 0.009).
We conducted post hoc analyses to examine average
number of male partners by age and race or ethnicity within
survey year. We found no differences between 15 to 24, 25 to
34, and 35 to 44 year olds in 2002 (P = 0.575 and 0.729,
respectively) or 2006­2010 (P = 0.183 and 0.724, respectively).
Additionally, there were no differences in number of male
partners between white MSM and Hispanic and non-Hispanic
black MSM in 2002 (P = 0.140 and 0.122, respectively) or
between white MSM and Hispanic MSM (P = 0.872) or white
MSM and black MSM (P = 0.054) in 2006­2010.
DISCUSSION
During the time when HIV and P&S syphilis were
increasing, self-reported number of male sex partners and sev-
eral STD/HIV-related sexual risk behaviors were stable or
decreasing among sexually active MSM in the United States.
Our findings were generally consistent with a previous study of
recent behavioral trends among MSM in Seattle,10 and a study
of MSM in Peru that found increases in HIV while condom use
was increasing and STDs were decreasing.9 Additionally, we
found no evidence that increases in STD/HIV testing were
related to the overall disease increases as recent testing among
sexually active MSM did not differ across time.
Consistent with a review and meta-analysis,15,16 we
found that subpopulations most affected by the recent increases
in HIV and P&S syphilis1,2 did not report a higher number of
male sex partners. Specifically, adolescent and young adult
MSM did not report a higher number of male partners than
other adult MSM. Additionally, sexually active black and His-
panic MSM did not report more partners than their white coun-
terparts, and, in 2006­2010, blacks reported fewer partners
than whites although the difference was not statistically signif-
icant. These findings suggest that factors other than an individ-
ual's sexual behavior should also be examined in relation to the
increases in HIV and P&S syphilis.
It is possible that sexual network factors are associated
with the increases in HIV and P&S syphilis. Partner-level
factors such as sexual risk, a lack of awareness of HIV infec-
tion, and less access to HIV care have been associated with
disparities in HIV infection among MSM. One study found
that black MSM had higher reports of same-race partners and
partners who were significantly older than MSM of other
racial or ethnic groups,17 and a 2005­2006 study found that
black MSM who were HIV-positive but not aware of their
infection were more likely to believe that having sex with
a same-race partner (ie, assortative mixing) lowered their
HIV risk.18 A 2008 study that included multiple partner-level
factors found that having a partner with an unknown HIV
status was associated with HIV and was more commonly
reported by black than white MSM.19 Furthermore, black
men were estimated to have the highest number of unidenti-
fied HIV infections,20 and studies have found that minority
MSM (black, Hispanic, mixed race) were more likely to be
unaware of their HIV infection.21­23 Additionally, access to
antiretroviral therapy which has been associated with reduced
HIV transmission24 is lower among black MSM.25 Finally, it
is possible that STD/HIV prevalence within the partner pool
are related to the increases in P&S syphilis and HIV, as young
and minority MSM have higher rates of HIV and STD. Thus,
sexual network factors, including partner risk and underlying
disease prevalence, may contribute to a higher risk of acquir-
ing HIV and syphilis.4,5
There are limitations to this study. The same-sex
measures included in NSFG through 2010 were limited;
therefore, we could not examine the number of unprotected
anal intercourse partners, partner characteristics (eg, type,
age, or race of partner), or whether MSM had partners who
were nonmonogamous. Also, 2002 NSFG did not assess the
use of crystal methamphetamines. NSFG relies on self-
reported data, so the potential nonreporting of same-sex
behaviors exists; however, the use of audio computer assisted
self-interview minimizes the chance that disclosure of same-
sex sexual behaviors would have changed over time. It is
possible that behavioral trends influence morbidity trends
with a time lag that was not possible to assess given available
survey years. Finally, it is possible that household surveys
may underestimate the riskiest MSM populations (eg, core
groups); therefore, findings may be most useful in combina-
tion with venue-based26 and convenience samples.
Data on MSM from national probability samples may be
useful for STD/HIV prevention, particularly aiding in the
identification of larger patterns of risk. Our findings suggest
the need to also consider issues in addition to sexual behavior,
such as sexual networks and disease prevalence in the sexual
network, to better identify the factors associated with the
observed increases in syphilis/HIV in young and minority MSM.
