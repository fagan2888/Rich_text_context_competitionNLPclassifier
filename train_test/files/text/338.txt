Abstract
Objective: Few studies have examined recent shifts in meat consumption (MC),
differences among US population groups, and the influence of psychosocial­
behavioural factors.
Design: Nationally representative data collected for US adults aged $18 years in
the 1988­1994 and 1999­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) and the 1994­1996 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals
(CSFII) and Diet and Health Knowledge Survey (DHKS) were used.
Results: We found a U-shaped trend in MC, a decrease between 1988­1994 and
1994­1996, and an increase from 1994­1996 to 1999­2004. NHANES 1988­1994
and 1999­2004 indicate that MC did not change significantly, particularly for all
meat, red meat, poultry and seafood. Between 1994­1996 and 1999­2004, average
MC, including red meat, poultry, seafood and other meat products, increased in
men. Women's total MC decreased, mainly due to decreased red meat and other
meat products, except for increased seafood. Noticeable differences existed in the
changes across population groups. Black men had the largest increase in con-
sumption of total meat, poultry and seafood; Mexican American men had the smallest
increase in poultry, seafood and other meat products. In 1999­2004, ethnic differ-
ences in MC became greater in women than among women in 1994­1996. Asso-
ciations between MC and energy intake changed over time. Perceived benefit of
dietary quality and food label use were associated with reduced red MC.
Conclusions: Noticeable differences exist in the shifts in MC across population groups
and surveys. MC increased in men but decreased in women in recent years.

Meats are key dietary sources for many important nutri-
ents including protein and many other essential micro-
nutrients such as minerals and vitamins to maintain good
health(1). During recent years, the Atkins diet, which
consists of high meat consumption (MC), has been
advocated for weight loss(2,3). On the other hand, MC has
been linked to higher intakes of saturated fat, total energy
and reduced consumption of vegetables(4,5), leading
some researchers to propose vegetarian diets as a means
to prevent many diet-related chronic diseases including
obesity, despite the many associated controversies(4,6­10).
MC has been related to increased chronic morbidity,
while higher intake of vegetables, fruits, cereals, nuts
and legumes has been independently associated with a
lower risk for several chronic diseases, such as IHD,
diabetes, obesity and many cancers(6,7). Earlier studies
indicate that diets largely based on plant foods, including
well-balanced vegetarian diets, offer a number of nutri-
tional benefits, including lower levels of saturated fat,
cholesterol and animal protein, as well as higher levels of
fibre, magnesium, potassium, folate and antioxidants.
Compared to their non-vegetarian counterparts, vegetar-
ians are found to have lower BMI, blood pressure and
blood cholesterol levels; lower rates of hypertension,
type 2 diabetes, prostate and colon cancer; and reduced
death rates from heart disease(4,6,7). Therefore, it would
be of interest to examine MC patterns over time and
determine whether they have been affected by the recent
related research findings and advocacy campaigns,
although many remain controversial(1,7,11,12).
Using US nationally representative data collected over
the past two decades, we examined the trends in US
adults' MC and compared the differences among gender,
ethnic, and socio-economic status (SES) groups. We also

tested whether psychosocial­behavioural factors such as
nutrition-related knowledge and perceptions, and food
label use might affect MC. Our findings will help shed
light on the recent shifts in food consumption patterns
and the variation in these shifts across population groups
in the United States.
Materials and methods
Overview of study design
Cross-sectional data collected from three data sets for
adults (aged $18 years) were used in our analysis: two
rounds of the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III 1988­1994 and 1999­2004), and the
1994­1996 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Indivi-
duals (CSFII). The dietary data (24 h recalls) collected in
CSFII and NHANES were designed to provide national
estimates of Americans' dietary intake patterns at the time
of the survey. Thus, in theory their findings should be
comparable, and could indicate time trends in Americans'
dietary intakes. We chose to give more attention to the
CSFII (1994­1996) than the NHANES III (1988­1994)
considering that CSFII provided more recent data and two
24 h recalls while NHANES III had only one, and that
CSFII collected information on participants' nutrition/
health knowledge and perception and other behavioural
factors related to food consumption, whereas NHANES
did not. In a 24 h dietary recall, the respondents were
asked to report the kinds and amount of food and bev-
erage items they ate over the past 24 h. Subsequently, the
data were linked to a food consumption table to help
estimate nutrient and total energy intake.
Database
The NHANES include a series of cross-sectional surveys
that provide nationally representative information on the
nutrition and health status of the US civilian population.
The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) con-
ducted three rounds of NHANES surveys, in 1971­1975,
1976­1980 and 1988­1994, respectively. Since 1999,
NHANES has been a continuous survey, and since 2002
the NHANES and CSFII dietary intake surveys were
merged into a single inter-agency survey conducted
jointly by NCHS and the US Department of Agriculture
(USDA). Thus, the CSFII 1994­1996 and the NHANES
2003­2004 surveys used similar methodology. The data
for the first 6 years of the period 1999­2004 were recently
made available. Since 1999, the NHANES has included all
people of all ages from birth, while some previous sur-
veys excluded people aged 74 years or older. All NHANES
used a stratified, multistage probability cluster sampling
design, and collected data following standardised proto-
cols. The survey consists of an in-home interview for
demographic and basic health information and a health
examination in a mobile examination centre. Household
interviews were conducted by trained staff consisting of
physicians, medical and health technicians, and dietary
and health interviewers. Detailed descriptions of the
study design and data collection have been published
elsewhere(13,14).
The CSFII (1994­1996), conducted by the USDA, was
designed to provide nationally representative information
for assessing Americans' dietary intake patterns and
trends over time(15). A nationally representative multi-
stage stratified sample of 16 103 non-institutionalised
persons aged 0­90 years residing in the United States
provided information about dietary intake (by two 24 h
recalls) in in-person interviews, but in some instances
only one 24 h recall was obtained.
The Diet and Health Knowledge Survey (DHKS), a
supplementary survey to CSFII, was completed by one
adult per household selected (n 5765) among those aged
$20 years who had completed at least one 24 h recall
in CSFII. DHKS included a number of questions that
attempted to measure participants' knowledge, beliefs
and perceptions related to nutrition and health, as well as
their food habits and use of food labels in food purchase.
Study populations
The NHANES data collected in 1999­2000, 2001­2002 and
2003­2004 from US adults were merged and yielded
a sample of 17 061 participants (8091 men and 8970
women) that had complete demographic data. Only
15 006 of them had complete dietary data (7148 men and
7858 women). NHANES III provided complete dietary
data for 19 618 adults; these were used in our analysis.
In the CSFII 1994­1996, 10 164 adults with two complete
24 h recalls (5198 men and 4966 women) were included.
To study the association between nutrition knowledge
and psychosocial factors and MC using the CSFII/DHKS
data, we excluded those aged 65 years or older (n 1319), to
obtain a relatively healthy sample of individuals who were
not on special diets, and excluded those who completed
only one 24h dietary recall (n 90). This resulted in a final
sample of 4356 individuals (2219 men and 2137 women)
who completed both surveys (CSFII and DHKS).
Dietary measures
In CSFII and NHANES, 24 h dietary recalls were collected.
In CSFII, dietary intake was assessed by one or two non-
consecutive, multiple-pass 24 h recalls that were 3­10 d
apart. In earlier waves of NHANES (1988­1994 and
1999­2002), only one 24 h recall was collected from each
participant in the household interview. A second day of
recall was collected from all participants in NHANES
2003­2004. Energy and nutrient intakes were calculated
by the USDA for CSFII and for NHANES 2003­2004, and
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/NCHS
for NHANES 1999­2002. Major food groups including
meats and vegetables and fruits (VF) were created by the
USDA for the CSFII data(16) (see below). We created these

food groups for NHANES using similar methodology based
on available food group codes for individual food items.
These food groups (measured in grams) were used in our
analysis. When two 24h recalls were available, the averages
were used. To our knowledge, the USDA system dis-
aggregated mixed dishes into individual components for
CSFII; however, NHANES grouped mixed dishes based on
the main components rather than disaggregating them into
individual food components. Thus, this might affect the
comparability of the CSFII and NHANES food group data
and our related findings.
Meat groups
In the CSFII data, the USDA grouped the different meats and
meat products into the following groups: total meat
(including all animal source food), red meat, poultry, sea-
food, and other meat products. For example, red meat
consisted of beef, pork, lamb, veal and game. Poultry
included chicken, turkey, duck and other poultry. Seafood
included fish and shellfish. Other meat products included
frankfurter and sausage, organ meats and food mixtures,
mainly composed of meat, poultry and fish. Mixtures
included items such as beef stew, spaghetti with meat sauce,
chilli, sausage with gravy, soup with added meats, beef and
potatoes or noodles, beef with rice and cooked vegetables,
ham or shrimp or tuna salads, hamburgers or cheeseburgers,
ham and cheese, roast beef or steak or chicken sandwiches
and seafood mixtures. For simplicity, we call the combined
meat groups `all meat' in contrast to all plant source food.
Nutrition-related psychosocial­behavioural
factors ­ food purchasing factors, nutrition
knowledge, food label-related practices and
food habits
A number of questions included in the CSFII/DHKS asked
about participants' knowledge, beliefs and perceptions rela-
ted to nutrition and health. We chose six individual questions
related to food purchasing behaviour measured on a 4-point
Likert scale (`very important' to `not important at all')
enquiring about each participant's concern about `how safe
the food is to eat', `its nutritional value', `its price', `how well
the food keeps', `how easy the food is to prepare' and `its
taste' and eight scales that covered areas of perceived benefit
of diet quality(17) (or how important it is for participants to
follow general dietary guidelines: e.g. how important it is to
purchase foods that are low in fat), food label-related prac-
tices (use, looking at, understanding and confidence in use),
and food habits (e.g. choosing low-fat variety of foods or
meat-related healthy habits, such as trimming fat from red
meat and removing skin from poultry).
First, we conducted exploratory factor analysis to decide
which scales in the DHKS could be reduced to a single factor
that explained the majority of the variance in its manifest
variables, using the Kaiser rule (i.e. eigenvalue . 1).
Next these scales were used to assess their associations
with MC. Principal components analysis of variables
within each scale was used for data reduction purposes.
All extracted components (standardised Z-scores) were
according to better health-related knowledge and food
label practices and were named based on the content of
each scale within the DHKS questionnaire. One compo-
nent per scale was extracted and explained 40­70 % of
the variance in the measures included within each scale.
We hypothesised that better practices and knowledge
would be associated with less MC, particularly red meat.
We also hypothesised that concern about price would
reduce the consumption of food in general, including
meat, and that concern about nutrition would have a
similar effect on perceived benefit of diet quality.
Main covariates
SES variables
We used education and family income as the indicators of
SES, considering their strengths and limitations(18). Educa-
tion was measured by years completed and then grouped
into 0: `,High school education', 1: `High school' (12 years)
and 2: `.High school education'. The poverty income ratio
(PIR) is the ratio of household income and the poverty line
published by the Census Bureau for a certain family size in
that calendar year. Specifically, we used the PIR categories
of 0­100% (below the poverty line), 101­199% and $200%.
Other main food groups
In our analysis, we used the consumption (in grams) of
VF and grains as comparison for MC as well as potential
confounders when assessing the association between MC
and total energy intake. Fruits included whole fruit, dried
and mixed dishes, and 100 % fruit juice; and vegetables
included potatoes, fried potatoes, garden vegetables,
salad greens and legumes.
Other covariates
Age, gender and race/ethnicity were considered as poten-
tially confounding variables in our models. On the basis
of the self-reported race and ethnicity, the participants
were categorised as non-Hispanic (NH) whites, NH
blacks, Mexican American (MA) and other.
Statistical analysis
First, we compared the average consumption of all meat
and the meat groups over time, in the whole population
and by gender. We also compared the changes across
ethnic and SES groups. To test the differences by ethnicity
and SES while controlling for other potential confounders,
we fit linear regression models by including these variables
simultaneously. Separate models were fit for each survey
and for men and women. Next, using the CSFII/DHKS data
and linear models, we tested the associations between MC
and nutrition knowledge, psychosocial, food purchase and
food habit factors. Finally, using linear regression analysis,
we tested how meat, VF and grain consumption might be

associated with total energy intake (TEI), the over-time
changes in the associations and how much of the variance
in TEI could be explained by them. All analyses were
conducted using survey commands in the STATA statistical
software package version 9?0 (Stata Corp., College Station,
TX, USA) to account for the complex sample design effects
in order to achieve nationally representative estimates and
unbiased statistical inference(19).
Results
Trends in meat consumption and the differences
across gender, ethnicity and socio-economic status
These nationally representative data showed a U-shaped
trend in MC between 1988­1994 and 1999­2004 (Table 1).
The increase between 1994­1996 and 1999­2004 was due to
increased MC by men for all the animal food groups.
Women's MC decreased, which was driven by a decline in
consumption of red meat and other meat products, while
consumption of seafood increased. All these changes were
statistically significant (P,0?05). Gender differences in
average MC were significant only for `all meat' in 1994­1996,
but by 1999­2004 all became significant (P,0?05). How-
ever, when comparing the NHANES III (1988­1994) with
1999­2004 data, no significant consumption change was
observed for `all meat', red meat, poultry or seafood.
Table 2 compares MC trends across ethnic, gender and
SES groups. A large proportion overall (62 of 200) of the
time-dependent changes was significant (P,0?05), and
most consisted of an increase among men and a decrease
among women. Between 1994­1996 (CSFII) and 1999­2004
(NHANES), there were a number of noticeable differences
in the changes across ethnic and SES groups. For example,
NH-black men had the largest increase in the intakes of total
meat, red meat, poultry and seafood. MA men had the
smallest increase in the consumption of poultry, seafood
and other meat products, though their increase in red MC
was comparable to the two other major ethnic groups.
Ethnic differences were more apparent among women: NH-
white women reduced consumption of all meat groups,
particularly other meat products, while NH-black women
increased consumption of all meat groups except for other
meat products. The pattern of shift among MA women was
not significant, with one exception wherein the reduction in
other meat products was larger than that for their ethnic
counterparts. Women with low education had the largest
reduction during this period in consumption of other meat
products, while women with high education reduced red
MC. Interestingly, among women, only the high-income
group reduced their red MC and increased their seafood
consumption significantly.
Comparing NHANES III to 1999­2004 data, very few
changes across race/ethnicity and SES groups were
significant. A significant reduction in red MC was noted
among NH-black men. MA women and men and women
in the middle-income group had significant drops in
consumption of other meat products. In general, differ-
ences in the changes among SES groups were small and
inconsistent. Among men, most groups had increased
their consumption of the various meat groups.
Covariates of meat consumption
Using linear regression models, we tested the cross-sectional
associations between age, ethnicity and SES and total MC
(Table 3), controlling for potential confounders. Our ana-
lysis indicates some noticeable gender and time (or survey)
differences in the associations. Both waves of NHANES data
show a consistent linear trend of decreased MC with age,
while in CSFII, older groups consumed more meat than the
reference age group. According to the NHANES men con-
sumed more meat than women, by approximately 100g/d,
but only by 9g/d according to the CSFII.
Ethnic differences in MC changed over time. In general,
they were disappearing in men (none remained sig-
nificant in 1999­2004), but became stronger in women
with NH-black women and MA women who consumed a
much higher amount than white women in 1999­2004, by
46?3 g/d and 31?4 g/d, respectively.
The association between SES and MC was weak. None
of the tested associations were significant, except for that
between education and MC among men in 1999­2004 ­
men with a high school education had lower MC (by
26?6 g/d) than men with low education.
Of the psychosocial­behavioural factors we tested
while controlling for various demographic and SES fac-
tors, only a few were associated with total and subtypes
of MC (Table 4). Only twelve of the eighty tests were
significant. For example, those who weighed taste more
as a factor in food selection consumed more red meat
while those who used food labels consumed less.
Association between meat consumption and total
energy intake
We also estimated the contribution of MC to TEI and the
differences across food groups by adding the same amount
(100g/d) of different food groups as well as the variation
explained by these food groups and the changes between
the survey periods (Table 5). A main finding was an
inverted U-shaped relation between MC and TEI over time,
both for the amount of energy contributed per 100g of meat
(i.e. overall energy density of meat) and for the variance in
TEI explained by MC. In addition, the results showed that
red meat contributed much more energy than other food
groups, particularly VF. While VF accounted for ,6% of
variation in TEI, MC explained > 10%.
Discussion
Our findings based on nationally representative data
indicate a U-shaped trend in US adults' MC between

-The differences were tested using linear regression models. Separate models were fit for each gender-survey group in each survey. The value of b shows the
difference compared to the reference group and adjusted for other variables in the model.
Sample sizes for NHANES III were smaller than Table 1 because of missing data on sociodemographic variables (men and women n 15 105; men n 7103;
women n 8002), but were similar to Table 1 for CSFII and NHANES 1999­2004.

1988­1994 and 1999­2004. The changes between 1988­
1994 and 1999­2004 based on NHANES data were not
significant. Between 1994­1996 (CSFII) and 1999­2004
(NHANES), average MC increased in men, but decreased
in women, mainly due to the decreased consumption of
red meat and other meat products. This gender difference
may be explained by gender differences in health and
nutrition awareness and belief(17). We suspect that some
of the differences revealed by these CSFII and NHANES
data are due to the true changes over time, while some
may be due to differences in the samples, dietary
assessment approaches and data coding across the these
surveys.
Some of our observed trends in MC may reflect chan-
ges in Americans' eating behaviours over the past two
decades. For example, in the 1980s and 1990s, lower MC
and higher grain consumption were considered part of a
healthy diet helping to reduce risks for CVD(1,7,11,12),
while during recent years reduced carbohydrate intake
and higher MC have been advocated for weight loss and
for reducing obesity and type 2 diabetes risks(2,3).
Increased MC over time is a worldwide phenomenon,
especially during recent years, among those developing
countries that have enjoyed rapid economic develop-
ment. In China, e.g., national nutrition surveys show that
among reference men, MC increased from 58 g in 1992 to
79 g in 2002(20). However, recent findings in the global
climate change area implicate high-meat diets as less
sustainable(21,22).
We observed some noticeable differences in the recent
changes (1994­1996 to 1999­2004) across the US ethnic
and SES groups. For example, NH-black men had the
largest increase in the consumption of total meat, poultry
and seafood, while MA men had the smallest increase in
poultry and seafood intake and their increase in red MC
was comparable to the other two main ethnic groups. The
ethnic differences in meat intake trends were more
remarkable in women. During this period, NH-white
women reduced their consumption of all meat and `other
meat products', whereas NH-black women increased
their consumption of all meat, poultry and seafood while
reducing their consumption of `other meat product'. MA
women had a major reduction in `other meat product'
consumption.
In general, SES differences in consumption levels and
time shifts were small and inconsistent. This is in contrast
with results from other studies in other countries that
found positive associations with income and educa-
tion(17), including an inverse association between income
and MC(23,24). The Glasgow and MONICA surveys
revealed that VF and oily fish consumption increased
significantly during 1986­1995, but showed no change

among the relatively deprived groups(25). We observed
increases in total and red MC among US men and more so
in the higher-income group, as well as a small decrease in
red MC among high-income women. This may be due to
the difference in the prices of meat and VF, people's
perception of their health values and response to nutri-
tion education.
We also compared the associations between TEI and
MC to those with other food groups as well as the over-
time changes in the associations. Our findings suggest
that interventions targeting MC rather than VF might have
a greater impact on TEI, since MC contributed more
energy and explained a higher proportion of the variation
in TEI than VF, although it is important to promote VF
consumption for other health benefits. The proportion of
variance in TEI that could be explained by MC and VF
dropped over time, suggesting the increasingly important
role in the American diet played by other food groups
such as snacks and sweetened beverages. For example,
the CSFII data showed large increases in Americans'
energy intake from salty snacks, soft drinks and pizza
between 1977 and 1996(26). Americans' average energy
intake from sweetened beverages increased by 135 %
between 1977 and 2001(27).
Moreover, our comparisons may indicate concerns
regarding the comparability of the CSFII and NHANES
dietary data, although other researchers have reported
time trends in Americans' dietary intakes using these
data(27). Our findings show that one may reach different
conclusions regarding the time trends based on different
data sets. For example, the amount of energy contributed
per 100 g of red meat was relatively stable between
NHANES III and 1999­2004 (1443 v. 1410 kJ (345 v.
337 kcal, respectively), in model 3), much lower than
what is shown in CSFII (2088 kJ (499 kcal)). Thus, if one
only compares the CSFII 1994­1996 and NHANES
1999­2004 data, one might conclude that red meat and
grain consumption would have contributed less energy
over time (e.g. a trend that can be explained by reduced
fat and sugar contents). This trend, however, was not
supported by the comparison between NHANES III
1988­1994 and 1999­2004 data. We suspect that part of
these differences could be due to the between-survey
differences in the food composition table used, sampling
designs, degree of under-reporting and food grouping
system, particularly with regard to mixed dishes.
We suspect that the reduction in MC, in particular
among US men, may be related to the BSE (bovine
spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease) epi-
demic in the United Kingdom, which peaked in January
1993 at almost 1000 new cases per week in cattle(28). BSE
created great anxiety in the United Kingdom and many
other parts of the world including the United States in the
mid-1990s (e.g. see Strom(29)). The study conducted by
Burton and Young(30,31) indicates that the first wave of
media reports about BSE (from 1989 to 1995) had an
immediate and detrimental impact on people's beef
consumption in the United Kingdom. However, US
women's red MC did not change much across the three
survey periods, while the big reduction in the mid-1990s
and a later increase in red MC in the early 2000s were only
observed in US men. On the one hand, one may suspect
that both US men and women's beef consumption would
decrease beyond the mid-1990s if people were concerned
about BSE. On the other hand, it is possible that because,
in general, men were more likely than women to con-
sume steaks, hamburgers and other beef products before
the outbreak of the disease in Europe; they had a greater
potential (both the possibility and amount) to reduce
their consumption beyond that point in time. Another
possible reason is that unlike Europe, in the United States,
animal brains are not used to produce animal feeds. Thus,
the risk of contamination is much less, and this was
emphasised by the Food and Drug Administration during
the scare. Further research is needed to help fully
understand the reasons for the changes in people's MC
that we observed.
Although it is widely believed that individuals' eating
patterns are affected by many psychosocial­behavioral
factors, we found that only a few of the factors we
examined were associated with the total and subtypes of
meat intake. This is likely due to the possible consider-
able day-to-day variations in individuals' MC, and the 24 h
recall dietary data we used cannot adequately measure
their usual food patterns. Furthermore, people's food
patterns may be affected by many other factors including
contextual­environmental factors such as food avail-
ability and food price. Nevertheless, our analysis shows
that factors such as concern about food taste were asso-
ciated with increased red meat intake, while concern
about nutrition, perceived benefit of diet quality and use
of food labels were associated with reduced red MC.
Healthy habits such as trimming fat from red meat and
removing skin from poultry were associated with reduced
total MC.
Earlier research including ours using the DHKS sug-
gested that nutrition knowledge was positively associated
with a number of diet quality indicators and indices
independently of socio-economic and demographic fac-
tors(17), while certain healthy eating behaviours (includ-
ing trimming fat from meat and removing skin from
chicken) were associated with reduced fat and saturated
fat intake(32). Food label use seemed to modify the
positive association between household income and
dietary quality, whereby participants who did not use
food labels did not show the benefit(33). Altogether, these
findings indicate the importance of nutrition education
and empowering individuals to use food labels to pro-
mote healthy eating.
While our present analysis revealed some encouraging
signs of small desirable changes in Americans' MC, par-
ticularly among women with regard to red meat and

seafood consumption, one of our earlier studies shows that
Americans' VF consumption has not increased based on
the NHANES III (1988­1994) and 1999­2002 data, despite
the many national efforts to encourage VF consumption(34).
We found that roughly 89 % of Americans failed to meet the
USDA Dietary Guidelines for VF, but that the high-income
group was 65 % more likely to meet the guidelines than
the low-income group. These suggest that more vigorous
intervention efforts and policy changes are needed to
promote healthy eating among Americans. In addition,
the differences we observed in the relationships between
SES and the consumption of meat and VF indicate potential
future directions for interventions including government
policies on food subsidies and taxes.
An important strength of the present study is the use of
nationally representative data and tests of differences across
population groups. However, it has several limitations. First,
only one or two 24h dietary recalls were collected in the
CSFII and NHANES. Multiple 24h recalls are needed to
measure individuals' usual dietary intake, although there is
also some evidence that under certain circumstances one
recall can provide a good estimate(35,36). Our recent sensi-
tivity analysis assessing differences in estimates of intakes
using one compared with two recalls for NHANES
1999­2004 showed a high correlation (.0?95) between the
two methods for dairy-related nutrients and TEI(37). Some
earlier studies have suggested an under-reporting problem
in national dietary surveys using 24h recalls such as
NHANES; for example, mean energy intake was found to be
lower than energy requirements in 15% of all 24-h
recalls(38­40). Such measurement errors might have affected
our findings, including lowering the average amount of MC.
We cannot rule out the possibility that some of the time
trends we observed between 1994­1996 and 1999­2004
may be due to the sample and methodological differences
between CSFII and NHANES. Further research is needed to
answer such questions.
In conclusion, the present study provides some evi-
dence of the shifts in food consumption patterns in the
United States over the two decades, and the variation
across ethnic and SES groups. The differences in the
relationships between SES and the consumption of
meat and VF may indicate potential future interventions.
Vigorous intervention efforts and policy changes are
needed to promote healthy eating among Americans.
