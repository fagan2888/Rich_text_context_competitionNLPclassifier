Two observations suggest a genetic similarity
among close friends: (1) the observed similarity
among friends in certain traits and behaviors; (2) the
evidence that many of these traits and behaviors
have a genetic component. This hypothesis is tested
using monozygotic (MZ) twins, dizygotic (DZ) twins,
full biological siblings, and their best friends from
the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (Add Health). Whether the resemblance
between MZ twins' friends is larger than that
between friends of DZ twins and full siblings is
investigated with respect to 4 individual traits or
behaviors: grade point average (GPA), AHPVT (the
version Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test [PPVT]
designed for Add Health), aggressive behavior, and
depression. Our hypothesis is supported in analyses
among same-sex friends (not among different-sex
friends) for GPA, aggressive behavior, and AHPVT.
Hypothesis
Empirically, two sets of well-established findings
suggest the hypothesis of a genetic similarity among
close friends, at least with respect to certain attitudes,
traits, and behaviors: (1) friends share certain atti-
tudes, traits and behaviors (e.g., Bearman &
Bruckner, 2000; Berelson et al., 1954; Duncan et al.,
1972; Matsueda, 1982; Matsueda & Heimer, 1987);
(2) many of these attitudes, traits, and behaviors have
been shown to be partially genetic (e.g., Plomin et al.,
2003; Plomin et al., 2001; Rodgers et al., 1999).
These findings point to the possibility of a genetic
similarity among best friends because they are similar
in certain characteristics and because the source of the
similarity is partially genetic.
A hypothesis of genetic similarity shared by
spouses and friends (Rushton, 1989) was suggested to
expand Hamilton's (1964) theory of inclusive fitness.
Hamilton's theory was put forward as an explanation
for altruism: individuals who perform altruistic acts
towards genetic relatives are more efficient in spread-
ing their genes (inclusive fitness) than individuals who
only attempt to spread their genes through their own
offspring (individual fitness). A number of studies
have tested the hypothesis of genetic similarity by
showing that spouses and close friends are more
similar than randomly paired individuals and that the
friends and spouses of more genetically related indi-
viduals (e.g., monozygotic [MZ] twins) are more
similar to each other than are those of less genetically
related individuals (e.g., dizygotic [DZ] twins; Baker
& Daniels, 1990; Daniels & Plomin, 1985; Iervolino
et al., 2002; Manke et al., 1995; Rowe & Osgood,
1984; Rushton & Bons, 2005).
In this analysis, we test the hypothesis of genetic
similarity shared by best friends among adolescents
using MZ twins, DZ twins, and full siblings as well as
their best friends collected by the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add
Health; Harris et al., 2003). Our analysis makes at
least three contributions. First, we use data on both
genetically related individuals and their friends
directly. In almost all previous empirical tests, friends
data are reported by genetic relatives. The perceptions
of others' behavior have been considered unreliable
because the reporters tend to project their own behav-
ior onto others (Bauman & Ennett, 1996). In Add
Health, both the siblings and their friends are partici-
pants of the study. Second, we perform statistical tests
to find out whether the friends of MZ twins are sig-
nificantly more similar to each other than are those of
DZ twins. No previous study appears to have per-
formed such a test. Third, we provide a detailed
description and examination of the biometrical
research design for the hypothesis testing.
Similarity Among Friends
It has long been recognized that friends or peers tend
to hold similar attitudes, exhibit similar attributes, or
engage in similar behaviors. Berelson et al. (1954)
found that individuals with best friends who are
Democrats are more likely to vote for Democratic
presidential candidates than individuals with
Republican friends. Duncan et al. (1972) reported
that students whose friends have college plans are more
likely to have college plans themselves controlling for

social class. Friends are found to be similar in height
(Berkowitz, 1969), activities, needs, attitudes, and per-
sonality (Berscheid & Walster, 1978). The incidence of
delinquent behavior was found to be associated with
the delinquency of the peer group (Matsueda 1982;
Matsueda & Heimer, 1987). Girls who had low-risk
friends in their immediate circle of friends or in their
peer groups were much less likely to experience sexual
intercourse or pregnancy than girls who had average-
or high-risk friends (Bearman & Bruckner, 2000).
Lazarsfeld and Merton (1954) introduced the term
`homophily' to describe the similarity in attitudes,
attributes, and behaviors among close friends.
Friends Effects Versus Selection Effects
Scholars have offered two interpretations for the
observed similarity between friends. The traditional
view tends to view influences from peers and friends
as causal. That is, friendship changes the behaviors of
the individuals in the friendship and makes them more
similar to each other. Adolescent behavior is consid-
ered especially vulnerable to the influences of friends
and peers. One well-publicized view (Harris, 1995)
argued recently that socialization mainly takes place in
the peer groups of childhood and adolescence and, in
comparison, parents do not have any important long-
term effects on child development.
Earlier psychological literature often considered
social or peer pressure the primary process of influ-
ence between friends. Bronfenbrenner (1967, 1970)
argued that peers can change children's behavior
because they put pressure on them. Later work has
demonstrated a whole spectrum of influence mecha-
nisms from coercive pressure at one extreme to
something very close to a reasoned debate at the other
extreme (Bandura, 1977; Berndt, 1999; Dishion et al.,
1999; Dishion et al., 2001; Hartup, 1983; Piaget,
1932/1965).
Most researchers acknowledge that not all the simi-
larity among friends is due to friend influence (second
interpretation). Two individuals may become friends
because they are similar in some characteristics to each
other (see review by Berndt et al., 2002; Kandel, 1978).
Scarr and McCartney (1983) argued that children are
not only influenced by environment, they also actively
participate in the creation of their own environment.
Children tend to seek the right environment that
matches their own genetic propensities. Friends and
peers are a natural part of an adolescent's environment.
Part of the similarity between friends may thus be
due to selection rather than influence. Researchers
generally use the term `selection' to describe all
processes, conscious or not, in which individuals
similar in certain characteristics become friends
(Berndt et al., 2002). Sociological (Bearman &
Bruckner, 2000; Kandel, 1978) and epidemiological
(Bauman & Ennett, 1996) literature also refer to this
as an issue of friends versus selection effects.
Economists sometimes treat this as the problem of
endogenous group membership (Moffitt, 1998).
Selection effects have been shown empirically to
be present for a wide range of adolescent behaviors.
Kandel (1978) reported that prior homophily on a
number of behaviors and attributes is a determinant
of friendship formation. Billy and Udry (1985) and
Billy et al. (1988) provided evidence that both white
girls and white boys have a tendency to choose same-
sex best friends whose sexual experiences are similar
to their own. Psychological literature suggests that
the strength of friends' influence is exaggerated
whenever it is estimated by the association between
children's characteristics and their friends' character-
istics (Berndt et al., 2002). Kandel (1978) pointed
out two decades ago that ignoring the selection effect
would vastly overestimate the influences of friends.
Kandel's analysis suggests that the prominent work
by Duncan et al. (1972) assessing the effect of friends
on educational aspirations exaggerates the estimates
by about 100%.
Evidence for our hypothesis will have implications
for the debate of friends versus selection effects. If best
friends are, indeed, to some extent, genetically similar,
it would suggest a genetic role in friendship selection
and formation even though our data can't inform on
the mechanisms of the selection and formation.
Friends Data From Add Health
A common methodological issue in the research on
friends' influence is using the same children to report
on both their own attitudes and behaviors and their
friends' attitudes and behaviors. In a study on school
involvement and disruptive behavior, Berndt and
Keefe (1995) showed that the estimates of friends'
influence are generally higher for measures derived
from students' reports on friends than for measures
derived from the friends' self-reports. The discrepancy
exists because children believe they are more similar to
their friends than they actually are (Aboud &
Mendelson, 1996). When children are asked to report
their friends' attitudes and behavior, they tend to
project their own attitudes and behavior onto their
friends. Previous work in sociology comparing mea-
sures on perception of behavior with measures on
actual behavior has also demonstrated this projection
tendency for sexual behavior among boys (Wilcox &
Udry, 1986) and for smoking and drinking behavior
among male and female adolescents (Fisher &
Bauman, 1988).
Research Design
To investigate genetic similarity with respect to a trait
such as cognitive ability among friends, an ideal
approach is to identify the specific genes associated
with the trait. Evidence that the genes of friends were
significantly more similar than the genes of nonfriends
would suggest a genetic basis for homophily with
respect to the trait. In the absence of such measures, we
turn to indirect methods that take advantage of the
information contained in genetically related individuals.

Figure 1 describes one unit of our analysis. Each
unit consists of four individuals: Person A (A), Person
B (B), A's friend (AF), and B's friend (BF). A working
sample was contructed for each trait analyzed; a
working sample typically contains several hundreds of
such units. Previous work suggests that A and AF are
likely to be similar with respect to certain personal
characteristics (B and BF is equivalent to A and AF,
and will be omitted when appropriate). However,
similarity between friends may not be evidence for
genetic basis for friendship. For a test of whether best
friends share a genetic similarity, advantage was taken
of data consisting of four types of units described by
Figure 1: (1) units in which A and B form a MZ twin
pair, (2) units in which A and B form a DZ twin pair,
(3) units in which A and B form a same-sex full sibling
pair, and (4) units in which A and B are unrelated
same-sex pairs randomly selected from the Add
Health data. After type (2) units are analyzed alone,
types (2) and (3) units will be combined to increase
sample sizes; types (2) and (3) units can be combined
because DZ twins and full siblings share the same
amount of genetic material.
Our hypothesis is primarily interested in the rela-
tionship between A and AF. However, a direct
estimation of the similarity or correlation between A
and AF does not provide evidence on whether the rela-
tionship is genetic or not. For the hypothesis testing,
we rely on the research design described in Figure 1.
The design can be viewed as a quasi `experiment' in
which we vary the genetic relatedness between A and
B, and record any corresponding systematic variations
in the similarity between AF and BF with respect to
some individual characteristics. The crucial feature of
the research design is that the two structures ([1] a
pair of MZ twins with their best friends, and [2] a
pair of DZ twins with their best friends) are the same
except that the amount of genetic material shared
between MZ twins are twice as much as that between
DZ twins. Therefore, if the MZ twins' friends are
more similar than DZ twins' friends, genetic factors
must be implicated.
It is assumed that (1) the genetic similarity between
A and AF (if it exists) does not vary by whether A and
B are MZ or DZ twins, (2) the environments for iden-
tical twins are no more similar than the environments
for fraternal twins (the usual equal environments
assumption for twin analysis), and (3) there is a
genetic contribution to the four traits/behaviors
(Grade Point Average [GPA], the version Peabody
Picture Vocabulary Test [PPVT] designed for Add
Health [AHPVT], aggression and depression) exam-
ined in this analysis.
Table 1 is constructed to illustrate the reasoning.
To fix the idea, two cases are considered: the case in
which a genetic similarity is, indeed, shared by A and
AF, and the case in which a genetic similarity is not
shared. In both cases, regardless of the type of twins
used, correlation between AF and BF for certain traits
and behaviors will be expected because (1) A and B
are correlated since they are DZ or MZ twins and
share genetic and common environmental factors, and
(2) best friends (A and AF) are correlated whether or
not genetic factors are involved (first column of the
expected empirical results). However, if a genetic simi-
larity is shared among best friends, the correlation
between AF and BF for MZ twins will be stronger
than that of the DZ twins. The source of this stronger
correlation is the greater genetic relatedness between
MZ twins (between A and B) than DZ twins.
We will deem our hypothesis of a genetic similarity
among best friends supported if empirical evidence
shows a stronger correlation between AF and BF for a
greater genetic relatedness between A and B. Our
hypothesis will predict that when A and B are a ran-
domly selected pair, AF and BF should not be more
similar than randomly paired individuals; when A and
B are DZ twins, AF and BF are substantially more
similar than a randomly selected pair, and that when
A and B are MZ twins, AF and BF are significantly
more similar than when A and B are DZ twins. The
importance of the role genes play is signified by the
extent of the increase in similarity between AF and BF
corresponding to the increase in genetic similarity
between A and B.
At least two other factors can influence the results
of the `experiment'. First, genetic similarity between
friends is likely to be trait-specific. Our objective is
not to investigate the role the entire genome plays in
friendship formation or whether friends as whole
persons are genetically similar. Rather, we investigate
whether genetic heritage for a number of personal
traits is implicated in friendship formation. Of the

four traits investigated, we predict a markedly
stronger genetic similarity among friends with respect
to academic performance than with respect to, say,
depression. Individuals may want their friends to be
like themselves on some characteristics, but not
others. Individuals are likely to seek friends who are at
a similar level of academic performance. On the other
hand, individuals may or may not want to seek friends
with a similar level of depression.
Second, criteria for selecting same-sex friends may
be different from criteria for selecting different-sex
friends. A same-sex friendship is when A and AF or B
and BF are of the same sex. The level of academic
performance should be an important factor for same-
sex friends as well as different-sex friends, but we
expect stronger results from the same-sex friends than
different-sex friends.
To avoid this potential confounding effect, an
adjustment was made at two levels. At the level of the
unit of analysis as described in Figure 1, we made sure
that the full sibling pair in each unit of analysis was of
the same sex. Then at the analysis level, all outcomes
were analyzed twice: once using same-sex friends and
once using different-sex friends (A and AF are of the
same sex).
Data and Analytical Methods
Sample and Measures
The data for the analysis come from the sibling sample
within the Add Health, which is a school-based study
that focuses on the health-related behaviors of stu-
dents in grades 7 through 12 in 1994 in the United
States. Add Health has deliberately incorporated the
behaviorÂ­genetic designs as components in an other-
wise traditional survey. The sibling sample is
composed of six groups: MZ twins, DZ twins, full
biological siblings, half biological siblings, cousins,
and biologically unrelated adolescents living in the
same household. The result is an unprecedented
genetic sample for a national study of this magnitude.
In Waves I (1994) and II (1995), the classification
of the twins into MZ pairs and DZ pairs was based
primarily on self-reports of confusability of appear-
ance. At Wave III in 2002, DNA samples were
collected from a subset of the Add Health sample. The
subset consisted of 2574 MZ twins, DZ twins, and
full biological siblings. For these individuals, genomic
DNA was isolated from buccal cells using a modifica-
tion of published methods. The zygosity of the twins
was then redetermined at the DNA level through a
comparison of their match on 12 unlinked STR
(http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/).
In the analysis, MZ twin pairs, DZ twin pairs, and
full biological sibling pairs were drawn from `in-home'
Add Health data. Different-sex DZ twin pairs and dif-
ferent-sex full sibling pairs were removed from the
analysis (when A and B are of different sex, see Figure
1) because the nature of the relationship between two
female friends (A and AF) may be considerably differ-
ent to the relationship between two male friends (B
and BF).
Respondents in Add Health were asked to nominate
same-sex and different-sex friends starting with the
closest friend, including girlfriends and boyfriends. To
construct the unit of analysis described in Figure 1, one
same-sex and one opposite-sex friend were selected
from these nominations for each adolescent in the
genetic pair samples. The grades from which GPA were
calculated were gathered in both the school question-
naire and the in-home interview. On the other hand,
AHPVT, aggressive behavior, and depression were only
available in the home interview. Since fewer friends
have data on these measures, our analyses of these mea-
sures contain fewer cases than the analysis of GPA. The
actual samples sizes used will be described along with
the description of our analysis results.
Our sibling sample consists of adolescents aged
between 13 and 18 years in 1994 (M = 15.7, SD = 1.79).
About 50% of the sibling sample was male. Of the ado-
lescents, about 60% were white Americans, 12.8%
nonwhite Hispanics, and 14.8% African Americans.
These descriptive statistics vary somewhat by analysis
samples that were used to analyze the four traits. Four
traits were examined: GPA (M = 2.70, SD = 0.76),
AHPVT (M = 102.1, SD = 13.5), aggressiveness
(M = .21, SD = 0.403), and depression (M = 1.58,
SD = 0.38).
GPA is the friend's self-reported mean letter grade
for English, mathematics, science, and history.
AHPVT with 78 items is an abridged version of the
Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) especially
designed for Add Health. The PPVT measures an

individual's receptive (hearing) vocabulary for
Standard American English and provides, at the same
time, an estimate of verbal ability or scholastic apti-
tude (Dunn & Dunn, 1981). The test was given to
adolescents present at the in-home Wave I survey.
PPVT has been used widely as a measure of academic
performance in social sciences (e.g., Duncan &
Brooks-Gunn, 1997; Moore & Snyder, 1991).
Aggression was measured by the average of the
responses to four questions. Respondents reported
how often during the past year they had (1) gotten
into a serious fight, (2) hurt someone badly, (3) used
(or threatened to use) a weapon, and (4) taken part in
a gang fight. The response categories ranged from 0
(never) to 3 (five or more times).
The depression variable was intended to measure
psychological health based on the adolescents'
responses to questions from the CES-D Scale (Radloff,
1977), the Beck Inventory (Beck, 1978), and several
interview questions pertaining to the respondent's
general health (see Appendix A). The depression
index, which represents the mean item score across 23
items that measure different aspects of depressive
symptoms, has a reliability of .879. Original responses
were ordinal in nature, ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (all
the time). Thus, a higher depression index score indi-
cates more depressive symptoms.
Statistical Models
Correlation coefficients were used to measure the
homophily between AF and BF with respect to a per-
sonal characteristic. For exploratory purposes, this
can be accomplished by Pearson's correlation proce-
dure. But for calculating correlation coefficients while
controlling for age, regression methods were used. The
structural equation model (Neale & Cardon, 1992)
has been the standard method for analyzing twin and
sibling data. More recently, Guo and Wang (2002)
showed that the mixed model or the multilevel model
(which has long been established in statistical litera-
ture [Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992; Searle, 1971; Searle
et al., 1992]) and included as a standard procedure in
many major statistical packages including SAS and
SPSS) can be used for the analysis of biometrical data.
Guo and Wang (2002) demonstrated that the mixed
model generally yielded results equivalent to those
from the SEM/Mx. Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh
(2004) showed the equivalence between the structural
equation models and the multilevel models.
A genetically informative sibling sample is essen-
tially a sample of correlated observations with the
correlation created by shared environmental and
genetic influences among siblings. The following
mixed model estimates correlation coefficients while
taking into account the age of the siblings:
Y
ij(t)
= 
0
+ 
1
age
ij
+ u
j(t)
+ e
ij(t)
where Y
ij(t)
is the trait for adolescent i in pair j for
pair type t (MZ twins, DZ twins, DZ twins and full
siblings), 
0
is the intercept, 
1
is the coefficient for
age, u
j(t)
is the pair-specific random effect for pair
type t, and e
ij
is the individual-specific random effect
or the ordinary least squares-like error term. The
standard assumptions are that u
j
and e
ij
are mutually
independent N(0, 2
u
) and N(0,2
e
) random variables.
The within-pair correlation between AF and BF,
adjusted for age, for sibling type t can be obtained
from an 
t
= 2
ut
/ ( 2
ut
+  2
et
). Our hypothesis is that

MZ
is significantly larger than 
DZ
and than 
DZ + fullsib
.
A formal comparison can be carried out via sta-
tistical hypothesis testing using the null hypothesis
H
0
: 
MZ
 
DZ
or H
0
: 
MZ
 
DZ + fullsib
. We carried out
this test using the bootstrapping method (Efron &
Tibshirani, 1993), which has long become a standard
tool in the statistical literature for a wide range of
statistical problems. The computationally intensive
bootstrapping method resamples the data by pair
(without breaking up the pairs) with replacement for
2000 times, each time reestimating the mixed model
and recalculating 
MZ
Â­ 
DZ
. The 2000 estimates of

MZ
Â­ 
DZ
are then ranked. The 95% confidence inter-
val can be constructed by the 2.5th and 97.5th
percentiles of the 
MZ
Â­ 
DZ
estimates.
Results
Table 2 provides estimated correlation coefficients
between AF and BF for GPA, AHPVT, aggression, and
depression. The correlation coefficients are estimated
separately for friends of MZ twins, friends of DZ
twins, and friends of DZ twins and full siblings as well
as friends of randomly paired individuals from the
sibling sample of the Add Health. The correlation coef-
ficients are estimated separately for friendships between
the same genders and friendships between different
genders. The number of sibling pairs used for the calcu-
lation is given in the parenthesis. The 95%
bootstrapping confidence intervals for the difference in
correlation coefficient between the MZ twins and DZ
twins as well as between the MZ twins and the com-
bined sample of DZ twins and full siblings are located
towards the end of each row.
When a friendship is between same-gender sib-
lings, the correlation for GPA between MZ twins'
friends (.55) is larger than that between DZ twins'
friends (.24) and that between DZ twins' and full sib-
lings' friends (.25). The bootstrapping resampling
analysis shows a 95% confidence interval of 0.15,
0.55 for the MZ/DZ difference and an interval of
0.16, 0.46 for the MZ/(DZ and full sibling) difference,
pointing to evidence for a role of genes for GPA in the
formation of friendship. The analysis of different-sex
pairs has yielded a different pattern of results with a
95% confidence interval of Â­0.08, 0.40 for the
MZ/DZ difference.
We consider AHPVT another measure of academic
performance in the present context and expect results
from AHPVT to be similar to those on GPA. For the
same-gender friends, the MZ twin correlation (.64) is
substantially larger than that for DZ twins (.46),

giving a difference of .18 and a 95% confidence inter-
val of Â­0.05, 0.53. The same-sex difference between
MZ twins and the combined sample of DZ twins and
full siblings is similar (.20) with a 95% confidence
interval of 0.001, 0.40. The results for the different-
gender friends again show a different pattern from
those for the same-sex data.
The correlation for random pairs ranging from
.025 to .030 is negligible for both same-gender and
different-gender friends. The random pairs, paired
randomly by individuals within the Add Health sibling
sample, are expected to be uncorrelated with respect
to any of the four characteristics under consideration
in this analysis. The random-pair analysis is intended
to provide a set of baseline results against which the
results from sibling data can be compared. The
random-pair result is the average of 100 simulated
samples of 500 pairs each.
Like GPA and AHPVT, we had expected to find
empirical support for our hypothesis for aggression par-
ticularly for the same-gender pairs. The empirical
support for our hypothesis for aggression is evident. For
the same-gender friends, the correlation for DZ twins
(.14) and for DZ twins and full siblings (.18) are only a
fraction of that for MZ twins (.73). The bootstrapping
procedures yield two corresponding 95% confidence
intervals of 0.22, 0.82 and 0.25, 0.75. In contrast, for
the different-gender friends, the three correlations are
.16, .24, and .20, respectively, with two corresponding
confidence intervals of Â­0.41, 0.41 and Â­0.30, 0.37.
Although the point estimates for depression from
the same-sex friends do indicate a stronger correlation
for MZ twins (.46) than for DZ twins (.29) and for
DZ twins and full siblings (.26), the 95% confidence
intervals of Â­0.22, 0.54 and Â­0.12, 0.46 fail to
confirm that the two differences are statistically signif-
icant. The analysis of the different-sex friends does not
show any statistically significant difference between
MZ and DZ twins or between MZ twins and the com-
bined sample of DZ twins and full siblings.
We have estimated the correlation coefficients
between the siblings with respect to the four traits in
addition to the correlation between the siblings'
friends. The former is generally stronger than the
latter. For example, the correlation between the MZ
twins for GPA is .68 as compared with the correlation
of .55 (Table 2) between the friends of the MZ twins.
Similarly, the two estimated correlation coefficients for
AHPVT are .81 for the MZ twins and .64 (Table 2)
for the friends of the MZ twins, respectively.
Discussion
Our analysis has produced evidence that the resem-
blance between AF and BF is stronger when A and B
are MZ twins than when A and B are DZ twins or
when A and B are DZ twins or full siblings. As
expected, the evidence only comes from the analysis of
same-sex friends. Of the four traits or behaviors under
consideration, GPA and aggression have yielded statis-
tically significant results by the bootstrapping
procedure, that is, the difference in correlation
between MZ and DZ twins is significant. So is the dif-
ference between MZ twins and the combined sample
of DZ twins and full siblings. The results for AHPVT
are only significant for MZ twins versus the combined
sample of MZ twins and full siblings. The difference
between MZ and DZ twins for AHPVT is close to but
not quite significant. For depression, the analysis of
same-sex friend pairs did not yield a statistically sig-
nificantly stronger correlation for MZ twins.
We consider these findings evidence for a genetic
similarity shared by best friends among adolescents in
the United States. The MZ twins, DZ twins, and full
siblings have isolated genetic from environmental cor-
relation among best friends and provide an instrument
through which the genetic similarity between A and
AF can be identified. Our research design assumes that
the structure for MZ twins is the same as that for DZ
twins. The design attributes changes in the correlation
between AF and BF to (1) the changes in the genetic

relatedness between the twins/siblings and (2) the exis-
tence of a genetic similarity between A and AF. If AF
is completely unrelated to A genetically, the increased
similarity due to increased genetic relatedness alone
between A and B will not be reflected in the increased
similarity between AF and BF.
These data must be interpreted with caution. Even
if friends are, indeed to some extent, genetically alike,
friends do not receive the same genes the way biologi-
cally related siblings receive the same genes from their
parents. A substantially greater variety of patterns
must exist with respect to genetic relatedness among
best friends than among biological relatives. For
example, friendship decisions are probably based on
phenotype rather than genotype recognition, suggest-
ing a role by genetic heterogeneity, defined as distinct
gene sequences at the same locus (allelic heterogeneity)
or different loci (nonallelic heterogeneity) responsible
for indistinguishable phenotypes. Not all individuals
seek friends who are similar to themselves in certain
traits and behaviors. Among those who do seek
friends similar to themselves, not all individuals look
for the same set of traits and behaviors in their
friends. Our results are an average of all extant pat-
terns observed in the sample.
The suggested genetic basis for homophily among
friends is trait-specific. The existence of a genetic basis
for measures like GPA and cognitive test scores does
not necessarily imply a genetic basis for another trait.
Depression could be one of those traits. We have rea-
soned that the larger the gap between the correlation
for the MZ twins' friends and the correlation for DZ
twins' friends, the larger the role genes might have
played in friendship formation. But we do not know
the exact size of the genetic role because no heritabil-
ity can be derived from the correlation estimates for
the trait in question.
More MZ twins (15.7%) than DZ twins (7%)
nominate the other twin as a best friend. However,
this does not necessarily lead to an overestimation of
the genetic component. Indeed, if there is a genetic
contribution to friendship formation, we would expect
the number to be larger for MZ twins than DZ twins.
Our empirical findings are in support of Rushton's
(1989) hypothesis of genetic similarity at least in the
case of best friends among adolescents. Recognizing
the genetic contribution for homophily in adolescent
friendships has also important implications for under-
standing the nature of friend or peer influences. Social
scientists have long suspected an essential role of peer
influences in shaping the behavior of adolescents.
Abundant evidence has been found linking individu-
als' behavior with their friends' behavior. The
traditional approach tends to attribute all of this
linkage to friends' influence. While recognizing that
part of the linkage may well be friends' influence,
more recent work argues that part of the linkage may
be due to selection and that ignoring selection would
exaggerate friends and peer influences. Our analysis
has not only provided evidence for the selection argu-
ment, but has also shown that part of the selection
may be genetically based.
