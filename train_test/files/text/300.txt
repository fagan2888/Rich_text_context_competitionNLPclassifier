demographic correlates. Obesity. 2006;14:139­147.
Objective: To examine the prevalence and correlates of
night eating, the core behavioral symptom of night eating
syndrome among adolescents and adults, using two public
access survey databases of nationally representative sam-
ples.
Research Methods and Procedures: Data were extracted
for individuals age 13 years or older who completed food
diary data for the National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey III (N  18,407) or the Continuing Survey of
Food Intakes by Individuals (N  10,741). Prevalence es-
timates were calculated for three commonly used definitions
of night eating. Logistic regression was used to examine
correlates of night eating: type of day, season, gender, age,
race/ethnicity, and BMI or obesity.
Results: With few exceptions, findings were similar in the
two surveys. Night eating is most common during the week-
end; prevalence is greatest among young adults (18 to 30
years of age) and least common among individuals age 65
years or older; and is not associated with BMI or obesity.
Gender or ethnicity effects were not found to be stable
across surveys.
Discussion: Experts need to consider type of day, age
group, and possibly gender and race/ethnicity when exam-
ining population differences in night eating. Longitudinal
studies are needed to further examine the link between night
eating and obesity.
Key words: night eating, disordered eating, BMI, meal
patterns
Introduction
Night eating syndrome (NES)1 was introduced by
Stunkard et al. (1) to characterize a clinical disturbance
that seemed to have caused or contributed to the main-
tenance of obesity in a subset of some severely obese
patients. The defining features of NES were evening
hyperphagia or night eating, morning anorexia, and
sleep disturbance. After being ignored by researchers
for several decades, in recent years NES has become
the focus of increasing scientific investigation. Although
there is a growing literature that suggests that
night eating (the core behavioral symptom of NES) is
an important clinical feature among some obese pa-
tients, epidemiological studies have failed to show a
correlation between night eating and obesity. As de-
scribed in a comprehensive review of the literature (2),
however, this research has progressed in the absence of
a uniformly accepted definition of NES or its clinical
features, and the conflicting findings in the literature
concerning the association between night eating and obe-
sity may, in part, be the result of differences in the
definition of NES.
The behavioral symptom of night eating has been
operationalized based on how late in the day (evening or
night) the eating episode occurred and/or the proportion
of total daily calories consumed during the eating epi-
sode. As illustrated by Striegel-Moore et al. (3), who
applied five different definitions of night eating to a large
epidemiological sample of girls, not surprisingly the
prevalence of night eating varied considerably depending

on the particular cut-off points chosen for time of day or
percentage of caloric intake consumed. For example,
when defining night eating as eating 25% or more (1) vs.
50% or more of daily caloric intake after 7 PM (4), the
prevalence in a large sample of 16-year-old girls was
40.7% and 24.5%, respectively. When defining night
eating as eating very late in the day (after 11 PM),
prevalence was reduced to 14.5% (3). The study did not
examine whether night eating varies by day of the week
or time of the year, yet it seems reasonable to assume that
the behavior is more common on weekend days than
during the week, and it may also be more common in the
summer months when many people take vacations and
high school and college students have the opportunity to
stay up later. This study also found that, with increasing
age, night eating, especially eating very late in the day,
became considerably more common and ranged from a
low of 6.5% in 9-year-olds to a high of 21% in 19-year-
olds.
How prevalence of night eating changes over the course
of adulthood is unclear. For example, given the time de-
mands of employment, it is possible that younger adults
are more likely to eat late in the day compared with
adults over 65 (who may no longer be working full-time
or at all). Experts have noted that the time of day when
the evening meal occurs varies among cultural groups.
For example, Italians tend to eat dinner much later than
Americans, a difference that has prompted Italian obesity
experts to propose that a definition of night eating should
use a relatively late cut-off point for time of day (5). To
determine more fully the demographic correlates of night
eating, studies of more diverse population samples are
needed.
Finally, a critical question concerns the clinical signifi-
cance of the behavior of night eating. Striegel-Moore et al.
(3) did not find a significant association between night
eating and overweight among their sample of girls 9 to 19
years old. It is possible that the association of night eating
and overweight may be observed in adults, yet we are not
aware of studies that have tested this relationship in a
representative community sample.
The present study addressed these gaps by examining the
behavior of night eating in two nationally representative
samples of adolescents and adults residing in the United
States. In the absence of prior data across a range of ethnic
groups and age groups, we did not formulate specific hy-
potheses concerning ethnic or age group differences in the
prevalence of night eating. Based on the well-established
finding that food intake varies qualitatively and quantita-
tively between weekdays and weekend days (6), we hypoth-
esized that night eating would be more common on Fridays
and Saturdays compared with weekdays. We also hypothe-
sized that night eating would occur more frequently during
the summer months, compared with other times of the year.
Whether the behavior of night eating is of clinical interest
has not yet been established, and we did not formulate a
specific hypothesis concerning the association of night eat-
ing and BMI or obesity. To answer these questions, we
capitalized on the availability of two large public access
databases, namely the National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES) III (7) and the Continuing Sur-
vey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII) (8). Each con-
tains detailed data from a representative sample of non-
institutionalized, civilian U.S. residents concerning food
intake, including all foods and liquids consumed over a
24-hour period, time of day of intake, and type of meal (e.g.,
dinner).
Research Methods and Procedures
Description of the Surveys
The analyses used data from two surveys, the NHANES
III (7) and the CSFII 1994 to 1996/1998 (8). The design of
NHANES-III has been described elsewhere (7). Briefly,
NHANES-III involved 33,994 respondents in 89 geographic
areas in the U.S. The sample was designed to be represen-
tative of the non-institutionalized, civilian population of the
U.S., covering the entire lifespan; the age range for the
survey was 2 months and older. The survey data were
collected over a 6-year period (1988 to 1994). Each survey
participant was interviewed at home and asked to participate
in a medical examination, which included measurements of
height and weight, and a 24-hour dietary intake recall.
Respondents reported all foods and beverages consumed
except plain drinking water (i.e., not bottled) for the previ-
ous 24-hour time period (midnight to midnight). The
present analysis focused on the subpopulation of NHANES-
III respondents who were age 13 years or older and either
Hispanic or non-Hispanic black or white. Younger children
were not included because it was assumed that their eating
times would be determined largely by their parents. Rates of
night eating were not estimated for other ethnic groups
because sample sizes were insufficient for statistically reli-
able estimates.
A detailed description of CSFII 1994 to 1996/1998 is
available elsewhere (8). Briefly, CSFII involved 21,662
respondents in 62 geographic areas in the U.S. The sample
was designed to be representative of the non-institutional-
ized U.S. population residing in households, covering the
entire lifespan. The survey consisted of a sample of indi-
viduals of all ages, collected from 1994 to 1996, and an
additional sample of children (age 1 to 9 years) inter-
viewed in 1998. Each respondent was asked to complete
two food intake interviews (24-hour dietary intake recalls)
conducted 3 to 10 days apart. Participants were asked to
report everything eaten or drunk the previous day between
midnight and midnight. To maintain comparability with the

NHANES-III data, the present study used only the first day,
and the analysis focused on the subpopulation of CSFII
respondents who were age 13 years or older and either
Hispanic or non-Hispanic black or white.
Statistical Analysis
Three definitions of night eating previously examined by
Striegel-Moore et al. (3) were used: consuming 25% of
the total daily calories between 7:00 PM and 4:59 AM,
consuming 50% of the total daily calories between
7:00 PM and 4:59 AM, and consuming anything between
11:00 PM and 4:59 AM, regardless of the amount of calories
consumed. Because the CSFII and NHANES-III food re-
calls covered a 24-hour period from 12:01 AM until the next
midnight, night was defined as the union of two time
segments, 12:01 AM to 4:59 AM, plus 7:00 PM or 11:00 PM
(depending on the definition) to midnight.
The percentage of individuals who exhibited night
eating was estimated for each definition by season of the
year, type of day (weekend vs. weekday), age group, gen-
der, and race/ethnicity. Due to the complex survey de-
signs of CSFII and NHANES-III, weighting, stratification,
and clustering were taken into account in all statistical
analyses. Mean and percentage estimates were computed
using PROCs SURVEYMEANS and SURVEYFREQ in
SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Logistic regres-
sion (PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC in SAS) was used to
model variables associated with night eating. Separate mod-
els were constructed for each survey and for each definition
of night eating. Night eating by a given definition (1  yes;
0  no) served as the outcome variable. The predictors were
type of day, season, gender, age group, race/ethnicity, and
all possible two-way interactions among gender, age, and
race/ethnicity. Type of day was coded as weekday (Sunday
through Thursday) or weekend day (Friday and Saturday).
Season was coded as winter (December through February),
spring (March through May), summer (June through Au-
gust), and autumn (September through November). Age was
coded into four categories (13 to 18, 19 to 30, 31 to 64, and
65 years old), and race/ethnicity was coded into three
categories (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and
Hispanic). Obesity was defined as BMI 30 for individuals
above age 18 years and at or above the age- and gender-
specific 95th percentile of BMI for adolescents. Prior to
analysis, all covariates were centered as recommended (9).
To adjust for the large number of statistical tests, a conser-
vative level of statistical significance was adopted (p 
0.01).
It has been hypothesized that night eating is associated
with obesity (1). To examine this association, obesity
(binary) and BMI (continuous) were modeled as a function
of night eating status, controlling for age group, racial/
ethnic group, gender, and total caloric intake throughout
the day. Obesity was modeled using logistic regression, and
BMI was modeled using linear regression (SAS PROC
SURVEYREG).
Results
Demographic Characteristics
Estimates of demographic characteristics based on the
two surveys are described in Table 1. Estimates differed
slightly across surveys, perhaps, in part, because they cov-
ered different timeframes. The largest racial/ethnic group
was non-Hispanic white, and the largest age group was
adults age 31 to 64 years.
Rates of Night Eating for Each Definition
Estimates of the percentage of individuals exhibiting
night eating for each definition, by survey, are provided in
Table 2. Night eating by the first definition (25% kcal
after 7 PM) was estimated to be present in more than one-
third of the population. Night eating by the other two
definitions (50% kcal after 7 PM and any eating after
11 PM) was less common; the estimates indicated that fewer
than 13% met these definitions of night eating, regardless of
survey. For all definitions of night eating, estimated rates
were lower in CSFII than in NHANES-III.
Correlates of Night Eating
Weekdays vs. Weekend Days. Compared with CSFII, the
food diaries in NHANES-III more often described eating
on weekend days (36.1% of food diaries in NHANES-III
vs. 30.7% in CSFII; Table 3), possibly resulting in the
aforementioned greater rates of night eating in NHANES-
III. In both surveys, there was a main effect of type of
day for the definitions involving consuming 25% and
50% of the daily calories after 7 PM [Wald 2 (1)  6.76
to 20.29, p  0.01], consistent with the results shown in
Table 3, after adjusting for type of day, season, gender, age
group, race/ethnicity, and all possible two-way interactions
among gender, age, and race/ethnicity. Night eating was
1.2 to 1.4 times more likely to occur on weekends, depend-
ing on the definition and survey. Type of day was not
associated with eating after 11 PM in either survey (p 
0.05). Season effects were not significant for any definition
or survey (p  0.05).
Demographic Characteristics. Tables 4 (NHANES-III)
and 5 (CSFII) show estimated rates of night eating for each
definition by gender, age group, and racial/ethnic group. For
each definition, in each survey, the log odds of night eating
were modeled as a function of type of day, season, gender,
age group, race/ethnicity, and all possible two-way interac-
tions among the latter three variables.
The main effects of gender and race/ethnicity differed
across surveys. No main effects of gender and race/ethnicity

were significant in CSFII (p  0.03). In contrast, in
NHANES-III, men were 1.2 and 1.4 times more likely than
women to exhibit night eating for the definitions involving
consuming 25% of the daily calories after 7 PM and any
eating after 11 PM, respectively [Wald 2 (1)  10.61/13.25,
p  0.002]. Furthermore, in NHANES-III, by all definitions
of night eating, black respondents were 1.3 to 1.6 times more
likely than respondents in the other racial/ethnic groups to
exhibit night eating by all definitions [Wald 2 (1)  11.10 to
35.51, p  0.0009].
In both surveys, young adults were 1.2 and 1.6 times
more likely than respondents in the other age groups to
exhibit night eating by the definitions involving consuming
25% of the daily calories after 7 PM and any eating after

Night Eating and BMI/Obesity
For each definition of night eating, BMI was modeled as
a function of night eating, adjusted to total daily caloric
intake (throughout the entire day), gender, age group, race/
ethnicity, and all possible two-way interactions among the
latter three variables. In only one case, specifically for the
definition involving consuming 25% of the daily calories
after 7 PM in NHANES-III, was night eating associated with
BMI [t(49)  3.35, p  0.002], but the association was
weak and in the direction opposite to that hypothesized:

predicted BMI for night eaters was 0.44 less than that for
non-night eaters (data available on request). BMI was not
associated with night eating by any other definition in either
survey (p  0.02). Similar models predicting the log odds of
obesity revealed no association with night eating by any
definition, regardless of survey (p  0.06) (data available
on request).
Discussion
Night eating represents a necessary (but not sufficient)
behavioral symptom of NES, yet, to date, no uniform op-
erational definition has been adopted in the literature. The
present study used three definitions commonly found in the
literature on NES to explore demographic correlates of this
behavior and its possible relation with BMI or obesity. To
our knowledge, this represents the first attempt to examine
the prevalence and demographic correlates and association
with BMI or obesity of night eating in a representative
sample of U.S. adolescents and adults. We found three main
findings across the two surveys. One, as expected, the most
inclusive definition (consuming 25% or more after 7 PM)
produced the highest prevalence. Two, for the first two
definitions (which differed by the amount of calories con-
sumed after 7 PM, namely 25% vs. 50%), but not the third
definition (which involved eating very late during the
night), day of the week mattered. And three, prevalence
estimates varied considerably by age group, with adoles-
cents being most likely and elderly individuals least likely
to meet the criteria for night eating. In NHANES, but not
CSFII, race/ethnicity moderated the relationship between
age and night eating, with Hispanic and black elderly indi-
viduals being especially unlikely to meet criteria compared
with the other age groups. Finally, gender and race/ethnicity
effects were observed only in NHANES but not in CSFII;
men were more likely than women and black Americans
more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to meet the
criteria for night eating.
Our data show that, in the U.S., eating 25% or more of
one's daily caloric intake after 7 PM is common. Quite
possibly, in cultures where eating the evening meal occurs
later in the day than in the U.S., the prevalence of night
eating by this criterion would be far greater still. One
approach to making the definition more applicable across
different cultures is to use a time of day that is so late that
in most cultures, it can be reasonably expected to be statis-
tically abnormal to still be eating (e.g., eating after 11 PM).
Another strategy that has been employed is to define night
eating as eating more than a certain proportion of one's
daily intake after the evening meal (for review, see ref. 2),
but this approach has its own disadvantage in that the
meaning of the evening meal may not be the same for
different people and that some may eat a considerable
amount of food over a long period of time (grazing) in the
late evening or at night, rather than consuming an evening
meal.
As expected, eating a considerable proportion of one's
daily intake after 7 PM was more commonly reported on
weekends, rather than during weekdays, likely reflecting
culturally normative practices of cooking more elaborate
dinners for family or friends or going out to eat on the
weekend, and this may mean eating later or eating more
than usual. Eating out, in particular, has been shown to be
correlated with eating more than when eating at home
(10­12). On the other hand, eating after 11 PM was not
found to be associated with day of the week, suggesting that
cultural practices play less of a role in eating very late in the
evening. One obvious methodological implication of this
finding is that studies comparing various population groups
need to ensure that comparable days are used when mea-
suring night eating. Regarding the clinical assessment of
frequency of night eating, similar to the instructions em-
ployed in the assessment of overeating, where episodes of
overeating are not counted when they are culturally norma-
tive (e.g., the Thanksgiving meal), we recommend that
contextual variables such as day of the week be considered.
Our results regarding age effects extend earlier work with
a sample of adolescents, where we found that with increas-
ing age, night eating (by any definition) became increas-
ingly more common (3). In the present study, night eating
was most common among young adults and least common
among the elderly. Pathology of a behavior is often defined
in relative terms; what is developmentally expected in one
group (e.g., going out late is more common in teenagers or
young adults than in elderly adults) may be unusual (i.e.,
statistically abnormal) in another group. Whether the pa-
thology of a behavior is clinically significant depends on its
association with a meaningful validator.
Different prevalence estimates by gender or ethnic group
were found in only one survey (NHANES-III) and, there-
fore, need to be interpreted cautiously. These differences
may reflect different subcultural practices such as employ-
ment patterns (e.g., working multiple jobs, shift work, etc.)
or different social norms about eating (e.g., weight concerns
may prompt women not to eat late in the day). Information
about education and employment status is needed to better
account for different prevalences. Because NHANES and
CSFII differed in many ways, it is impossible to pinpoint
why inconsistent results were found across the two surveys
concerning gender and race/ethnicity. The regression coef-
ficients for the gender effect were similar across surveys but
did not reach significance in CSFII due to larger variance
estimates (standard errors), which might be due, in part, to
the smaller sample size in CSFII relative to NHANES-III.
However, the regression coefficients for the effect of being
black in CSFII did not even approach the magnitude in
NHANES-III, suggesting that factors other than sample size

may play a role. Effects of both race/ethnicity and gender
warrant further investigation. Importantly, our results sug-
gest that, for other correlates (e.g., age, time of day, or
season), findings were quite similar across the two surveys.
Unexpectedly, we found a significant inverse association
between night eating and BMI for the definition of eating
25% or more after 7 PM. Individuals who reported night
eating by this definition were slightly thinner than those
who did not meet this night eating criterion. The analysis
was adjusted for total caloric intake; hence, the difference is
not due to night eaters consuming fewer calories in general.
However, this effect was very small and was found in only
one of the two surveys. This adds to the growing evidence
that, in non-clinical samples (for review, see ref. 2), night
eaters are less likely than others are to be obese.
Several limitations need to be considered. Because nei-
ther survey collected food diaries for consecutive days,
night eating was defined using single day records. Hence, it
was not possible to use a more restrictive definition of night
eating, requiring the behavior to occur on a recurrent basis.
We cannot rule out that a more regular pattern of night
eating might be associated with elevated BMI or obesity.
Also, the two surveys differ in several respects, suggesting
that greater confidence should be placed in the results that
were consistent across surveys. The survey data did not
permit examining specifically whether participants experi-
enced nocturnal eating episodes involving awakening dur-
ing the night and eating before returning to sleep, nor did
they include information about the participants' sleeping
patterns or sleep disorder symptoms. A study comparing a
small sample of obese individuals with NES and obese
individuals without NES found that nocturnal eating was
unique to NES and concluded that NES involved distur-
bances of sleep and eating (13). Finally, the data are cross-
sectional, and prospective studies are needed to further
determine the clinical significance of night eating.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that researchers need
to consider day of the week, age, and possibly gender and
race/ethnicity when examining population differences in
night eating. Studies are needed to identify critical thresh-
olds (which may well vary by culture) for determining
clinical significance of night eating. Our cross-sectional
data do not support a link between the behavior of night
eating and obesity in community samples. Future studies
need to explore whether adding a frequency criterion (e.g.,
twice weekly or more) or other behavioral or affective
components to identify a syndrome of NES will result in a
significant association with obesity and, if so, will identify
the mechanisms that mediate this association.
