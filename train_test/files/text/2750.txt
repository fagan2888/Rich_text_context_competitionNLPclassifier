Cyber Dating Abuse Among Teens Using School-Based
Health Centers
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Cyber dating abuse
victimization has been correlated with physical, sexual, and
psychological adolescent relationship abuse.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This is the first clinic-based study of
cyber dating abuse. Forty-one percent of youth reported cyber
dating abuse victimization, female more than male respondents.
Compared with nonexposed youth, abuse victims reported more
sexual assault; female victims reported more contraceptive
nonuse and reproductive coercion.
abstract
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of cyber dating abuse among
youth aged 14 to 19 years seeking care at school-based health centers
and associations with other forms of adolescent relationship abuse
(ARA), sexual violence, and reproductive and sexual health indicators.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted during the 2012­
2013 school year (participant n = 1008). Associations between cyber
dating abuse and study outcomes were assessed via logistic
regression models for clustered survey data.
RESULTS: Past 3-month cyber dating abuse was reported by 41.4% of
this clinic-based sample. More female than male participants reported
cyber dating abuse victimization (44.6% vs 31.0%). Compared with no
exposure, low- ("a few times") and high-frequency ("once or twice
a month" or more) cyber dating abuse were significantly associated
with physical or sexual ARA (low: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.8, 95%
confidence interval [CI] 1.8­4.4; high: aOR 5.4, 95% CI 4.0­7.5) and
nonpartner sexual assault (low: aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.3­5.5; high: aOR 4.1,
95% CI 2.8­5.9). Analysis with female participants found an
association between cyber dating abuse exposure and contraceptive
nonuse (low: aOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2­2.7; high: aOR 4.1, 95% CI 2.0­8.4) and
reproductive coercion (low: aOR 3.0, 95% CI 1.4­6.2; high: aOR 5.7, 95%
CI 2.8­11.6).
CONCLUSIONS: Cyber dating abuse is common and associated with
ARA and sexual assault in an adolescent clinic-based sample. The
associations of cyber dating abuse with sexual behavior and pregnancy
risk behaviors suggest a need to integrate ARA education and harm
reduction counseling into sexual health assessments in clinical settings.

Technology is ubiquitous in adolescents'
lives, with more than three-quarters
(78%) of adolescents (ages 12­17)
reporting having a cell phone and 93%
their own computer.1 Adolescents are
increasingly using texting and online
social networking sites to connect with
other adolescents, with 63% reporting
exchanging text messages daily and
29% reporting daily communication
through social networking sites.2 These
technologies also present opportunities
for harmful communication,3,4 including
abusive behaviors between peers or
"cyberbullying."5,6
More recently, studies have highlighted
how technology can facilitate or prop-
agate abuse between adolescents in
dating relationships.7,8 A qualitative
study of older adolescents, all with his-
tories of abusive relationships, identi-
fied multiple ways in which technology
was used to perpetrate abuse including
monitoring or controlling the activities
or whereabouts of a partner and being
emotionally or verbally abusive to a
partner.9 Technology is also used to
demand unwanted sex and publically
distribute nude or seminude photos of
peers.7,10 "Cyber dating abuse" involves
the use of technology to control, harass,
threaten, or stalk another person in the
context of a dating relationship and is
described as an emerging challenge for
today's youth.9,11
A related public health concern, ado-
lescent relationship abuse (ARA12*; ie,
physical, sexual, psychological abuse in
the context of a dating relationship) is
prevalent and associated with myriad
poor health outcomes.13­16 Although
conceptualized as a form of psycholog-
ical ARA,17 it is unclear whether cyber
dating abuse shares similar detrimen-
tal health correlates as documented for
physical and sexual ARA. Recent re-
search has shown that cyber dating
abuse and other forms of ARA fre-
quently overlap. Using a 3-state school-
based sample of adolescents, Zweig and
colleagues found that 26% of adoles-
cents in dating relationships experi-
enced cyber dating abuse and that
cyber dating abuse was highly corre-
lated with experiencing physical dating
violence, psychological dating abuse,
and sexual coercion.18 Furthermore, Zweig
et al identified the most significant
health correlates of cyber dating abuse
to be a history of sexual activity, and
having higher levels of depressive symp-
toms and anger/hostility.19 Whether
cyber dating abuse correlates with
poor health independent of its co-
occurrence with other forms of ARA
is not known. This may be particularly
relevant for clinicians uncertain about
the extent to which cyber dating abuse
potentially contributes to the behaviors
theyareaddressingintheclinicalsetting.
Possibly related to the health con-
sequences of ARA, adolescents seeking
care in confidential adolescent health
settings have a higher prevalence of
ARA than general population-based
studies.20­23 No studies to date have
examined cyber dating abuse and the
associations with other forms of ARA
and sexual risk behaviors among
a clinic-based sample of adolescents.
School-based health centers (SHCs)
represent a particularly unique setting
in which to examine the clinical corre-
lates of cyber dating abuse and ARA.
SHCs reduce barriers to health care
faced by adolescents, such as concerns
about confidentiality, lack of health in-
surance, and limited knowledge of the
health care system.24­26 These compre-
hensive clinics are well positioned to
offer prevention education as well as
interventions for youth experiencing
abusive relationships.27 The purpose of
this study was to examine character-
istics of cyber dating abuse and how
such abuse may be associated with
other forms of ARA, nonpartner sexual
violence victimization, and sexual and
reproductive health risks among youth
seeking care in SHCs. Understanding
the prevalence and correlates of cyber
dating abuse in this clinic-based sample
may guide prevention and intervention
efforts to reduce such abuse and im-
prove adolescent health.
METHODS
Study Overview
Data are from a cross-sectional survey
that served as baseline data for a
cluster-randomized trial in SHCs to
promote healthy relationships and re-
duce ARA (ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier
NCT01678378). Eleven SHCs in Northern
California were randomly assigned to
intervention or a delayed-intervention
control condition. Subsequent to ran-
domization but before participant
enrollment, 3 health centers (1 inter-
vention, 2 control) withdrew from the
study because of changes in school
administrators who would not allow the
SHCs to participate in research. During
the 2012­2013 school year, 1062 youth
aged 14 to 19 years seeking services at
any of 8 participating SHCs were invited
to participate. Over a 7-month enrollment
period, all students were screened at
clinic entry for age eligibility by trained
research staff. Eligible students in-
terested in participating were escorted
to a private area in the clinic for con-
sent or assent and survey adminis-
tration. Because participants were
receiving confidential clinical services,
parental permission for participation
was waived for minors. The study en-
rolled 1011 eligible students (771 fe-
male and 240 male students, 95%
participation rate). Youth who chose not
to participate reported not having
enough time or being unavailable for
the follow-up survey as the primary
reason for nonparticipation. Before the
clinical encounter, youth used a laptop
with headphones to complete a 15-

minute audio computer-assisted survey
about ARA and other forms of violence
victimization, sexual behavior, and care
seeking for sexual and reproductive
health. Students received a $10 gift card
to thank them for their time. Study
procedures were approved by in-
stitutional review boards at Public
Health Institute and the University of
Pittsburgh and were reviewed by ad-
ministrators at respective schools and
SHCs.
Measures
All measures were self-reported. Single
items assessed demographic charac-
teristics, including gender, age, race, US
nativity, relationship status, and sexual
orientation.Datingpartnersweredefined
as persons the respondent reported
"dating, going out with, or hooking up
with." All exposures and outcomes were
assessed by using a referent time period
of the past 3 months.
Cyber Dating Abuse
We assessed cyber dating abuse by us-
ing 7 items modified from Ybarra3 and
Bennett28 (Cronbach a = .72) that asked
about behaviors occurring within a dat-
ing relationship using technology. These
items were pilot tested using cognitive
interviewing techniques with a sample
of adolescents (n = 20) from a separate
SHC in the same region not participat-
ing in the parent study. In factor analy-
ses conducted with the entire study
sample, these items divided into 2
domains: sexual cyber dating abuse
(eg, pressuring to talk about sex) and
nonsexual cyber dating abuse (eg,
monitoring one's whereabouts). All
items assessed frequency: "In the past
3 months, how many times has a
partner [behavior] to you using mo-
bile apps, social networks, texts, or
other digital communication?" with 5
response options (0 = never, 1 = a few
times, 2 = once or twice a month, 3 =
once or twice a week, 4 = every day or
almost every day). For prevalence esti-
mates, responses other than "never"
were coded as having experienced
cyber dating abuse. In regression
models to account for frequency of
cyber dating abuse experiences, the
"once or twice a month" or greater re-
sponse options were collapsed into
a single (high) category, and the "never"
and "a few times" responses were left
unchanged.
Requests for Sexual Images
Anadditionalitemaskedaboutwhether
a respondent's partner had asked
them to send nude or seminude photos
of themselves in the past 3 months.
ARA Victimization
We used 3 items modified from the Con-
flict Tactics Scales--229 and the Sexual
Experiences Survey,30 1 for physical vio-
lence ("someone you were going out with
or hooking up with hit, pushed, slapped,
choked, or otherwise physically hurt
you") and 2 for sexual violence ("some-
one you were going out with or hooking
up with used force or threats to make
you have sex [vaginal, oral, or anal sex]
when you didn't want to" and "have you
had sex with someone you were going
out with or hooking up with when you
didn't want to, because you felt like you
didn't have achoice, eventhoughthey did
not use physical force or threats?").
Nonpartner Sexual Violence
Two items modified from the Sexual
Experiences Survey30 were as follows:
has someone you were not going out
with or hooking up with (1) used force
or threats to make you have sex (vag-
inal, oral, or anal sex) when you didn't
want to and (2) insisted that you have
sex when you didn't want to, without
using force or threats.
Sexual Behaviors
Single items assessed all participants
for any oral, vaginal, and anal sex (de-
fined by using anatomic terms) and
number of sex partners in the past 3
months. Female participants were
assessed for having a male sex partner
who was $5 years older than they
were within the past 3 months.
Pregnancy Risk
Female participants were presented
a list of 12 contraceptive methods and
askedtoendorseallmethodsusedinthe
past3months.Theresponseoption"Ido
not use anything to prevent pregnancy"
indicated contraceptive nonuse, and the
response "pull out" indicated unreliable
pregnancy prevention.
Reproductive Coercion
Recent reproductive coercion was
measured within the female sample by
using 10 items (see Supplemental Ma-
terial) developed by the investigative
teamandtestedinpreviousclinic-based
samples31,32 (Cronbach a = .74). Any
positive response was coded as positive
for reproductive coercion.
Analysis

cyber dating abuse was calculated and
differences by demographic charac-
teristics were tested via Wald log-linear
x2 tests for clustered survey data with
significance set at a = .05. Prevalence
of each of the 7 cyber dating abuse
behaviors was calculated for the total
sample and by sex. Wald log-linear x2
tests were used to assess differences
in other forms of ARA and study out-
comes by exposure to sexual and non-
sexual cyber abuse. Logistic regression
models for clustered survey data were
specified to assess the relationship of

RESULTS
Demographic Characteristics
Seventy-six percent of the sample was
female (Table 1). The majority of par-
ticipants (56%) were aged 16 and 17.
Reflecting the demographics of the
schools in which these SHCs were lo-
cated, 95% of the participants identi-
fied themselves as non-White, and
14% were born outside the United
States. Forty-six percent reported
being in a serious relationship, and
11% dating .1 person. Respondents
reporting exposure to recent cyber
dating abuse tended to be female;
older; African American or multira-
cial; bisexual, gay, lesbian, or unsure;
and not single.
Prevalence of and Sex Differences
in Cyber Dating Abuse Experiences
Forty-one percent reported any cyber
dating abuse in the past 3 months
(Table 1), with 13% reporting any sex-
ual cyber dating abuse and 37%
reporting nonsexual cyber dating
abuse (Table 2). More female than
male respondents reported nonsexual
cyber dating abuse (40% vs 29%, P =
.02). A significantly greater proportion
of female respondents reported their
partner had repeatedly contacted them
to see where they were or who they
were with (31% vs 21%, P = .01), which
was also the most common form of
cyber dating abuse.
Requests for sexual images, which was
not included in the cyber dating abuse
itemsbutisarelatedbehavior,werealso
more common for female respondents
(33% vs 18%, P = .01).
Co-occurrence of Cyber Dating
Abuse With Physical ARA, Sexual
ARA, and Nonpartner Sexual
Violence Victimization Among the
Total Sample
More than two-thirds (69%) of re-
spondentsreportingsexualcyberdating
abuse also reported nonsexual cyber
dating abuse victimization (Table 3).
Those reporting sexual cyber dating
abuse were also more likely to report
sexual ARA victimization (18% vs 6%, P =
.01), as well as sexual violence victimi-
zation by a nonpartner (36% vs 10%,
P , .01), compared with youth report-
ing no sexual cyber dating abuse. Youth
reporting nonsexual cyber dating abuse
reported more physical ARA victimi-
zation (14% vs 2%, P , .0001), sexual
ARA victimization (14% vs 4%, P ,
.001), and nonpartner sexual violence
(22% vs 9%, P = .01), compared with
youth who did not report nonsexual
cyber dating abuse.

Cyber Dating Abuse With Violence,
Sexual Behaviors, and Pregnancy Risk
In adjusted analyses of the entire
sample, all outcomes were significantly
associated with cyber dating abuse
frequency with the exception of anal sex

(Table 4). For instance, compared with
participants with no exposure, exposure
to occasional (low-frequency) cyber dat-
ing abuse was associated with a greater
likelihood of recent physical or sexual
ARA victimization (adjusted odds ratio
[aOR] 2.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]
1.8­4.4). Then, exposure to more fre-
quent (high) cyber dating abuse was
associated with an even greater likeli-
hood of recent physical or sexual ARA
victimization (aOR 5.4, 95% CI 4.0­7.5). In
the sample restricted to female partic-
ipants, more frequent exposure to cyber
dating abuse was associated with
greater likelihood of contraceptive non-
use (low-exposure aOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2­
2.7; high-exposure aOR 4.1, 95% CI 2.0­
8.4). A similar pattern emerged for re-
productive coercion (low-exposure aOR
3.0, 95% CI 1.4­6.2; high exposure aOR
5.7, 95% CI 2.8­11.6). Having an older
male sex partner and using an unreli-
able method for pregnancy prevention
were not related to cyberdating abuse in
this sample of female adolescents.
DISCUSSION
The present investigation expands on
previous studies of cyberdating abuse by
examining the relationship between this
abuse and other forms of ARA and sexual
assault outside the context of a dating
relationship. Although technology ex-
pands opportunities for learning, and
positiveinteractionamongyouth,34 the
intersection between technology and un-
healthy behaviors in dating relationships
assessed in this study clearly represents
a challenge for adolescent health pro-
motion. The prevalence of recent cyber
dating abuse in this clinic-based sample
is high. In comparison, the Zweig study
(using similar measures)18 reported
a past-year prevalence of 26% for any
cyber dating abuse in a school-based
sample, restricted to youth reporting
a current or past year dating relation-
ship. In our clinic-based sample, recent
cyber dating abuse was measured in the
past 3-month time frame and was not
restricted to youth in dating relation-
ships. The overall prevalence was 41%,
suggesting, as has been documented
with physical and sexual ARA victimiza-
tion, that cyber dating abuse appears to
be more common among youth seeking
care in confidential health settings com-
pared with the general adolescent pop-
ulation. This finding suggests a need to
prioritize targeted interventions within
school health settings.
The Zweig study18 examined the co-
occurrence of cyber dating abuse (both
sexual and nonsexual) with physical,
sexual, and psychological ARA and iden-
tified significant overlap with each of
these. The proportions reported by
Zweig are similar to the overlap identi-
fied in this study. A strength of the cur-
rent study is our ability to classify
frequency of cyber dating abuse and
associations with health behaviors.
These analyses found a significant re-
lationship between frequency of cyber
dating abuse and ARA, nonpartner sex-
ual violence, and sexual activity. Non-
partner sexual violence victimization is
a particularly novel finding that suggests

cyber dating abuse may be occurring in
the context of social networks that in-
volve greater sexual risk or that cyber
dating abuse may increase vulnerability
to sexual violence more generally. The
mechanisms for these associations and
how cyber dating abuse fits into the
trajectory of adolescent relationship de-
velopment merit further study to guide
intervention development.
SHCpatientsarepredominantly female35
(76% in this study). The female partic-
ipants in this study exposed to any re-
cent cyber dating abuse were 2 to 4
times more likely not to use any form
of contraception and 3 to 6 times more
likely to have experienced recent re-
productive coercion, compared with
unexposed females. Because these
associations were found after con-
trolling for recent physical and sexual
ARA, cyber dating abuse may be inde-
pendently associated with these sexual
and reproductive risks. Clinically, this
means that inquiring about cyber dating
abuse when assessing a youth's sexual
health behaviors may identify youth in
particular need for ARA intervention.
Furthermore, because more frequent
cyber dating abuse exposure is associ-
ated with greater health risk, a harm
reduction approach to reduce frequency
of cyber dating abuse may be helpful.
Thestudyhasseverallimitationsincluding
the cross-sectional nature of these data,
which precludes causal inference. As all

some clarity about recency and co-
occurrence of various forms of victimi-
zation. To create a brief survey, the ARA
measuresdidnotincludeotheraspectsof
abuse, such as verbal and psychological
abuse. A related limitation is the lack of
male-specific sexual health outcomes,
such as consistent condom use. Further
studieswithlargersamplesofyoungmen
and transgender youth seeking care in
confidentialclinicsettingsarewarranted.
Additionally, the prevalence of cyber

dating abuse appears to be significantly
higher for female adolescents, consistent
with findings from nonclinical settings
that also report more female than male
victimization.18 Analyses of differential
sexual health outcomes were limited by
the measures and the predominantly fe-
male sample. Future studies are needed
to assess whether sex differences in
cyber dating abuse persist in larger
samples and whether meaning, motiva-
tions, and health consequences of such
abuse may differ for male comparedwith
female adolescents. Because population-
based studies have found similar preva-
lence of physical ARAvictimizationamong
both males and females,36­38 sex differ-
ences in cyber dating abuse should be
investigated at a population level. Addi-
tionally, our finding regarding the sex
differences in the "sexting" request item
suggests there is a gendered context for
this abuse with females bearing the in-
creased burden for refusing or ac-
quiescing to sexting requests. This is
consistentwitharecentstudyofyounger
adolescents (ages 10­15) finding boys
more likely than girls to send sexually
explicit messages or photos.39 Finally,
findings from this nonrepresentative
sample from 8 SHCs in 1 Northern
California region cannot be general-
ized to all high school­age students.
An ongoing challenge in the field of ad-
olescent interpersonal violence pre-
vention is the constant shifting of
adolescentbehaviors.Capturingthe use
of technology to perpetrate ARA in
standardized survey items is uniquely
challenging because of the rapidly
evolving nature of technology and be-
cause this newer mode of communi-
cation (versus in-person or phone
conversation) brings new capacities
to victimize. For instance, cyber com-
munication can be rapidly shared
with others, potentially magnifying the
harmful effects for victims. Therefore,
behaviors that may not be harmful when
enacted in person may become harmful
when the communication mechanism
has permanency (ie, leaves a digital
footprint), can be repeatedly viewed by
the recipient, and can be easily spread
to nonrecipients. In particular, our mea-
surement of cyber dating abuse includes
behaviors that could be perceived as
part of normal sexual negotiation.
However, we conducted extensive cog-
nitive interviewing of these items,
modified only slightly from previous
studies to simplify language, and youth
were clear that they perceived these
items to be asking about abusive be-
haviors. Moreover, frequency data in-
dicate that youth experienced these
behaviors often, and frequent unwanted
behaviorisconsistentwithotherstudies
of ARA. It is possible, however, that the
prevalence reported here is an over-
estimation of cyber dating abuse.
These limitations notwithstanding, our
findings of cyber dating abuse preva-
lence and correlates are particularly
salient for health care providers and
health educators working in clinical or
school-basedsettings.Providersneedto
be aware of the extent to which cyber
dating abuse may be associated with
sexual behavior, other forms of partner
abuse, and with nonpartner sexual vio-
lence. That cyber dating abuse associ-
ations with pregnancy risk were found
for female adolescents in this sample
evenaftercontrollingforrecentphysical
or sexual ARA underscores the impor-
tance of assessing for multiple dimen-
sions of abuse. Educating youth about

offering strategies on how to manage

to implement in SHC settings.
