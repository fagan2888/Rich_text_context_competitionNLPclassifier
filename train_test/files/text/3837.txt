Abstract
Objective: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is common after bone marrow trans-
plantation (BMT), and it increases morbidity and mortality for transplant recipients. HCMV
infection may cause hepatitis and elevate the liver enzymes aspartate transferase (AST) and alanine
transferase (ALT). This study aimed to analyse the associations between liver enzyme levels and
infection with HCMV antigenaemia after BMT.
Methods: Data from 30 patients after BMT were collected at different time points (0.5, 1.0, 1.5,
2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 months post-transplantation). The patients were divided into the
HCMV antigenaemia-positive and HCMV antigenaemia-negative groups according to a peripheral
blood pp65 antigen assay. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify HCMV pp65 antigen and
conventional methods were used to detect liver enzyme levels.
Results: Twelve patients were pp65 antigenaemia-positive and 10 patients were positive in the first
3 months post-transplant. Liver enzyme levels were increased after positivity for HCMV
antigenaemia (p ¼ 0.034 and p ¼ 0.018 for ALT and AST, respectively). One month before
antigenaemia, AST levels were higher in the HCMV antigenaemia-positive group compared with
the negative group (p ¼ 0.006).
Conclusion: HCMV antigenaemia mostly occurs in the early stage of post-BMT and early
abnormal liver enzyme levels may increase the chance of HCMV antigenaemia after BMT.

Introduction
Over the past half century, tremendous
advances have been made in bone marrow
transplantation (BMT). Despite these
advances, infection is a severe complication
in patients undergoing BMT.1­4 Human
cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common
viral infection, which is a major factor in
morbidity and mortality undergoing
BMT.4­6 Rapid laboratory methods for the
early detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV)
are needed for preventing CMV disease in
transplant recipients. Some sensitive and
specific laboratory tests should be used to
rapidly diagnose CMV infection after
BMT. Detection of the HCMV antigen
pp65 in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBLs) is preferred for
screening for HCMV antigenaemia. This
is because this method is more rapid and
sensitive than culture and has a good
positive predictive value compared with
CMV-DNA by polymerase chain reac-
tion.7,8 Wirgart et al.9 (1996) found that
the best marker for monitoring kidney
transplant patients might be the quantita-
tive CMV pp65 antigen detection assay. In
their study, positivity for antigen pp65
was used for screening for HCMV anti-
genaemia. HCMV infection may cause
hepatitis and elevate the liver enzymes
aspartate transferase (AST) and alanine
transferase (ALT).
Our study aimed to investigate the
incidence of HCMV antigenaemia during
6 months post-BMT. Because HCMV
hepatitis is associated with solid organ
recipients and has little relation to
BMT,10,11 we also investigated the associ-
ations between HCMV antigenaemia and
ALT and AST levels at different time
points post-BMT.
Methods
Patients
From January 2012 to January 2014, a total
of 42 patients underwent allogeneic BMT in
our hospital. Patients who were followed
regularly for longer than 6 months after
receiving transplantation in our hospital and
provided written informed consent were
enrolled in the study. The exclusion criteria
consisted of clinical conditions that sug-
gested a life expectancy shorter than 6
months, previous HBV, HCV, or HDV
infections, and other liver diseases. A total
of 30 patients completed the study. These 30
patients ranged in age from 14.5 to 48.0
years old, with a mean age of 30.50 Æ 10.57
years. There were 13 men and 17 women.
The characteristics of the 30 patients are
shown in Table 1. There was no HCMV-
seropositive donor in our series. Every
hematopoietic stem cell donation and trans-
plantation in our centre strictly followed the
guidelines of the Ethics Committee of our
hospital and the Declaration of Helsinki.
Written informed consent was obtained
from each of the participants prior to
enrolment. The study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated
Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang

University (RES reference number: 2012-
005).
Immunosuppressive therapy
Chemotherapy before transplantation con-
sisted of busulfan (4 mg/kg/day from days
À7 to À4) and cyclophosphamide (60 mg/
kg/day from days À3 to À2). Prophylaxis
for graft-versus-host disease consisted of
mycophenolate mofetil (1.0 g/day for 3
months after BMT) and cyclophosphamide
(3 mg/kg/day for 24 h by intravenous infu-
sion, to maintain blood concentrations at
300­500 ng/ml until medicine could be taken
orally at 6 mg/kg/day).
Antiviral treatment
All BMT recipients received ganciclovir intra-
venously at a standard dosage of 5 mg/kg/day
until the day of transplantation. Antiviral
treatment for HCMV infection was started in
each BMT recipient according to a previously
reported preemptive therapy regimen.12,13
Briefly, all patients received ganciclovir intra-
venously at a standard dosage of 5 mg/kg
every 12h for 14 days or until negative
antigenaemia results were observed.
Methods of detection
From day þ 1 until day þ 90 after BMT,
HCMV pp65 antigen monitoring was per-
formed twice a month. From day þ 90 until
6 months after BMT, the pp65 antigen assay
was performed every month. At the same
time, conventional methods were used to
assay liver enzyme levels. Liver enzyme
levels are usually less than 40 U/L for AST
and less than 50 U/L for ALT. All of the
patients were monitored twice weekly during
the next 2 months after BMT, and then
every month during the next 4 months post-
6 months after BMT. A total of 296 blood
samples were taken from the 30 patients.
Immunohistochemistry was used to identify
CMV pp65 antigen. The CMV antigen assay
was performed as described previously, with
minor modifications.11,14 A standard two-
step immunohistochemical method was used
to assay CMV antigen expression in PBLs.
In brief, leukocytes were separated from
EDTA-anticoagulated blood and spread on
slides. Anti-CMV-PP65-Ag monoclonal
antibody (DAKO, Denmark) and the
EnvisionTM þ System peroxidase (DAB) kit
(DAKO) were used. The stained samples
were analysed under an optical microscope
with an image recording system (BH-2,
OLYMPUS, Japan). Cells that were stained
yellow or brown were positive and blue cells
were negative. The results are shown as the
number of positive cells per 50,000 leuko-
cytes, as previously described.15
Diagnosis of HCMV antigenaemia
HCMV antigenaemia is defined by sero-
logical conversion to CMV in a patient who
had been seronegative before transplant-
ation. In our study, we used antigenaemia

as the gold standard for detection of CMV,
as previously reported.16 The standard of
antigenaemia is in accordance with a previ-
ous report.17 HCMV infection was diag-
nosed when more than one positive cell was
observed among 50,000 leukocytes in the
blood samples. The patients were divided
into the infection group and the control
group according to the peripheral blood
pp65 antigen assay results.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS 16.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). The chi-
square test was performed for dichotomous
variables. The dependent samples t test was
used to compare differences in the median
values of continuous variables. A P value of
less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
Twelve (40.00%) patients were classified
into the HCMV antigenaemia-positive
group, and 18 (60.00%) patients were clas-
sified into the HCMV antigenaemia-nega-
tive group. Ten of 12 patients were positive
for HCMV antigenaemia during the first 3
months post-BMT. Two patients were posi-
tive for pp65 antigen in the first month post-
BMT, four were positive in the second
month, four were positive in the third
month, one was positive in the fifth month,
and one was positive in the sixth month. In
the HCMV antigenaemia-positive group, 10
patients' ALT levels were normal before
antigenaemia and nine patients' AST levels
were normal. In the HCMV antigenaemia-
negative group, six patients' ALT levels were
normal and eight patients' AST levels were
normal. ALT levels between the two groups
were significantly different (P ¼ 0.0015,
Fisher's exact test, two-sided). However,
AST levels were not significantly different
between the groups (P ¼ 0.323, Fisher's
exact test, two-sided). ALT and AST levels
at different time points in the HCMV
antigenaemia-positive group are shown in
Table 2.
At the time point when HCMV antige-
naemia was positive, ALT levels in six
patients in the HCMV antigenaemia-posi-
tive group were elevated compared with two
patients in HCMV antigenaemia-negative
group. This difference of higher ALT levels
in the HCMV antigenaemia-positive group
than in the negative group was significant
(P ¼ 0.034, Fisher's exact test, two-sided).
AST levels were also significantly differently
higher in the HCMV antigenaemia-positive
group than in the HCMV antigenaemia-
negative group (P ¼ 0.018, Fisher's exact
test, two-sided). ALT and AST levels in
the HCMV antigenaemia-positive group

Discussion
HCMV infects 70­100% of adults in
populations worldwide.18 For BMT recipi-
ents, infection with HCMV is still a major
problem regarding morbidity and mortality.
Clear evidence shows that HCMV donor
seropositive/recipient seronegative (Dþ/RÀ)
BMT may increase the incidence of HCMV
infection post-transplantation for recipi-
ents.19,20 There were no HCMV-seropositive
donors in our series to reduce the incidence
of transmission of HCMV infection by
leukoreduced blood product.2,20
In the present study, 83.33% (10/12) of
patients were positive for HCMV antigenae-
mia during the first 3 months post-transplant.
HCMV replication of most BMT recipients
typically occurs after engraftment until
approximately 100 days post-transplanta-
tion.1 HCMV is a ubiquitous herpes virus
that belongs to the b-herpes virus family.
Similar to other herpes viruses, the cellular
immune response plays a critical role in viral
clearance after HCMV infection. Cell-
mediated immunity for BMT recipients
during the first 100 days post-transplantation
is impaired because some infection may
occur, particularly HCMV.1,20
We found that HCMV infection was
significantly associated with liver enzyme
levels. A previous study showed that ALT
and AST values started to increase at the
time of distinct CMV infection (day 12),
suggesting an association between CMV
infection and elevated liver enzyme levels.21
In our study, the number of patients
whose ALT/AST levels were elevated at
different time points in the HCMV
antigenaemia-positive group and the
HCMV antigenaemia-negative group was
significantly different (P < 0.05).
Specifically, ALT and AST levels at 1
month before HCMV antigenaemia were
significantly elevated. Some studies have
shown no significant differences between
the infection and control groups regarding
other factors that produce an increase in
liver enzyme levels, such as age and the use
of immunosuppressive agents after trans-
plantation.22,23 Therefore, we suggest that
there is a significant association between
HCMV infection and an increase in liver
enzyme levels (ALT and AST) before
HCMV antigenaemia. HCMV induces acti-
vation of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) after
infecting fibroblasts and macrophage cells.
NF-kB response elements are present in the
enhancer region of the CMV major imme-
diate early promoter, and activity of this
promotor is strongly upregulated by NF-kB
in transient transfection assays.24 This acti-
vation of NF-kB may activate cytokines,
which may lead to liver injury and increased
ALT and AST levels.

We conclude that HCMV antigenaemia
often occurs in the early stage of post-BMT,
and that HCMV antigenaemia may be
detected early by measures of liver function
post-BMT. A limitation of our study was the
relatively small number of patients, which
might be associated with large interpersonal
variation. Future larger-scale studies are
required to verify the relationship between
HCMV antigenaemia and early abnormal
liver enzyme levels in patients who have
BMT.
