SUMMARY
Background
Excessive alcohol use has been reported to be responsible for 80 000 annual
deaths in the United States. However, the exact cause of death related to
the excessive use of alcohol has not been fully explored.
Aim
To assess the effect of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) on all-cause, liver-
related and cardiovascular mortality using population-based data.
Methods
Data were obtained from the Third National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES III) Linked Mortality Files. Alcohol consumption
was estimated as grams per day. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards
model was utilised to assess the effects of ALD on follow-up time to mor-
tality from all causes, cardiovascular disease and liver disease.
Results
A total of 8,306 participants were included [ALD (n = 148)]. Mortality
follow-up data were available for a median time of 178.27 months. Partici-
pants with ALD had increased risk for liver-related mortality [adjusted haz-
ard ratios or aHR 7.06 (2.09­23.79)], but not for overall mortality [aHR
1.14 (0.70­1.85)] or cardiovascular mortality [aHR 0.61 (0.11­3.25)].
Conclusion
Alcoholic liver disease increases the risks for liver-related mortality but not
for cardiac or overall mortality.

INTRODUCTION
Excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence
are a chronic, relapsing disease, which affects nearly 10%
of the population in the United States and Europe.1 In
the United States, significant healthcare costs and the
development of chronic disease comorbidities are associ-
ated with alcohol consumption. More than half of the
US adult population has consumed alcohol in the last
30 days, and 5% of the American adult population is
reported to consist of heavy drinkers.2 Excessive alcohol
use was responsible for 80 000 deaths in the United
States annually from 2001 to 2005.3 However, even small
amounts of alcohol consumption after the onset of liver
disease are associated with increased mortality.1
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is an important cause of
cirrhosis and a direct consequence of excessive alcohol
use. ALD encompasses a broad spectrum of liver pathol-
ogy, from simple steatosis to alcoholic steatohepatitis, cir-
rhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.4­8 Long-term alcohol
use has synergistic effects with other causes of chronic
liver disease to accelerate progression of liver disease.1 For
example, patients with Hepatitis C who regularly consume
alcohol experience an accelerated progression to fibrosis,
and a higher incidence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular car-
cinoma (HCC).9 In the United States, alcohol-related liver
deaths account for 48% of cirrhosis-associated deaths.4
However, the impact of alcoholic liver disease on overall
and cause-specific mortality in the US general population
is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to assess
the impact of ALD on overall mortality, liver-related mor-
tality and cardiovascular mortality as ALD can be consid-
ered an entirely preventable disease through screening and
appropriate treatment strategies.1, 7, 10
METHODS
To assess the impact of alcoholic liver disease on mortal-
ity, we used the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III) and the NHANES
III Linked Mortality Files.6 The survey was conducted
from 1988 to 1994 using a complex, multistage, strati-
fied, clustered sample design to obtain a representative
sample of the total civilian, non-institutionalised US
population. It includes an in-home interview for demo-
graphic and basic health information, a health examina-
tion within a mobile examination centre, and laboratory/
imaging tests (including ultrasonography of the
gall-bladder and liver). Public use data files were
obtained from the NHANES website (http://www.cdc.
gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). The study was approved by the
Inova Institutional Review Board.
Study population
During NHANES III, 33 994 participants were inter-
viewed in their homes, in which standardised question-
naires were used to obtain self-reported data on age, sex,
race or ethnicity, smoking and current medical condi-
tions.11 Age was categorised into four groups: 20­44, 45­
54, 55­64 and 65­74. Four major race/ethnic groups
were reported, including non-Hispanic white, non-His-
panic black, Mexican American and Other, which
included all Hispanics who were not Mexican American
and also all non-Hispanics from racial groups other than
white and black. A positive smoking history was defined
as ongoing smoking or having smoked at least 100 ciga-
rettes in life. Ninety-two per cent of the interviewed per-
sons underwent health examinations, in which blood and
urine specimens were obtained, and a number of body
measurements and tests were performed including
height, weight, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic
blood pressure, glucose tolerance tests, diabetes tests,
general biochemistry tests, antibody tests and ultrasonog-
raphy.7 The present study was restricted to participants
aged 20­74 at the time of the examination with complete
data on demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), history
of smoking and alcohol consumption, history of type II
diabetes, body mass index, waist circumference, blood
pressure measured at the time of examination, as well as
gradable hepatic ultrasound video images for hepatic
steatosis assessment. The following tests also were
required for all individuals in this study: serum glucose,
triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, aspartate amino-
transferase, alanine transaminase, transferrin saturation
levels, and viral hepatitis serologies for hepatitis B virus
(HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV).
Study definitions
Exposure to alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption
was assessed during the alcohol and drug component of
the NHANES III medical examination.6 Participants were
asked if they had at least 12 drinks of alcohol in their
entire life and in the past 12 months. Persons who
reported no alcohol drinking in their entire life were con-
sidered to be never drinkers. History drinkers were defined
as persons who reported drinking at least 12 drinks of
alcohol in their entire life, but none in the past 12 months.
Current drinkers were defined as persons who reported at
least 12 drinks of alcohol in the past 12 months. The
amount of current alcohol consumption was determined
from self-reported number of days with alcohol drinking
and the average number of drinks per day when they
drank alcohol in the past 12 months. In this study, we

Alcohol and liver mortality
defined one drink as 10 g ethanol, which represented
12-oz of beer, 4-oz of wine or 1-oz of liquor. Average daily
alcohol consumption was estimated by: the number of
drinks on a drinking day 9 10 g 9 the number of drink-
ing days over the past 12 months/365. Moderate alcohol
consumption was defined as 1­19 grams of alcohol con-
sumption per day. Excessive alcohol consumption was
defined as average daily alcohol consumption of 20 g or
greater.12, 13 A subcategory of excessive alcohol consump-
tion was considered as heavy alcohol consumption and
defined as 30 g or more of alcohol consumption per day.
Participants who did not answer the alcohol consump-
tion questions and participants who reported drinking
alcohol in the past 12 months but did not report the fre-
quency or amount of alcohol consumption were
excluded from this study.
Elevated liver enzymes. Elevated liver enzymes were
defined as serum alanine aminotransferase level greater
than 40 U/L or aspartate aminotransferase level greater
than 37 U/L in men and alanine aminotransferase or
aspartate aminotransferase level greater than 31 U/L in
women.
Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD). ALD was presumed
in participants who reported excessive alcohol use
(20 g/day) for the past 12 months and had elevated
liver enzymes at the time of the medical examination in
the absence of other chronic liver diseases including
CH-B, CH-C and iron overload as defined above. The
unexposed group (controls) included individuals with no
excessive alcohol consumption and no other possible
chronic liver diseases such as CH-B, CH-C, NAFLD,
iron overload and elevated liver enzyme.
Covariate definitions
· Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM) was defined as a fasting
glucose value of 126 mg/dL or greater or the use of oral
hypoglycaemics and/or insulin.
· Insulin resistance (IR) was evaluated using the homo-
eostasis of model assessment score (HOMA), which was
calculated using the formula: fasting serum insulin (U/
mL) 9 fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L)/22.5.14 HOMA-
IR was defined as a HOMA score of 3.0 or greater. DM
and IR were combined as one variable DM/IR in our
data analysis.
· Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure
of 140 mmHg or greater, diastolic blood pressure of
90 mmHg or greater, or being on oral antihypertensive
medications.
· Obesity was defined as a body mass index greater than
30 or a waist circumference more than 102 cm in men
and more than 88 cm in women.
· All sera were tested for core antibody to hepatitis B
virus (anti-HBC). Serum testing positive for anti-HBC
was tested further for the hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg). Chronic Hepatitis B (CH-B) was presumed in
individuals with positive HBsAg.
· All sera from participants were tested for antibody to
hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV). Serum testing positive for
anti-HCV was tested further for HCV RNA. Participants
with positive HCV RNA were considered to have
chronic hepatitis C (CH-C).
· Elevated serum transferrin saturation is a commonly
used indicator for a predisposition of iron overload.
Potential iron overload is defined as serum transferrin
saturation greater than 50%.
· Between 2009 and 2010, the hepatic steatosis (fatty liver)
was assessed by reviewing ultrasound video images origi-
nally obtained in NHANES III between 1988 and 1994.15
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was defined as
presence of moderate-to-severe hepatic steatosis from the
ultrasound examination in the absence of any other evi-
dence of chronic liver disease such as ALD, CH-B, CH-C
and iron overload.
Follow-up for mortality
The main outcomes in this study were all-cause mortal-
ity, liver-related mortality and cardiovascular mortality.
The NHANES III Linked Mortality Files provide mortal-
ity follow-up data from the date of NHANES III survey
participation (1988­1994) through 31 December
2006.6, 11 Mortality ascertainment is based on the results
from a probabilistic match between NHANES III and the
National Death Index (NDI) death certificate records. In
addition to mortality status, the linked file contains
months of follow-up from examination date as well as
the Underlying Cause of Death 113 (UCOD_113) code
to recode all deaths according to ICD-9 and ICD-10
criteria.16 Liver-related mortality (UCOD_113 15, 24,
93­95) included causes of death such as viral hepatitis,
hepatocellular carcinoma, alcoholic liver disease, and
other chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Cardiovascular
mortality (UCOD_113 58­63, 67, 70­74) covered causes
of death such as ischaemic heart diseases, heart failure,
atherosclerosis, cerebrovascular diseases, aortic aneurysm
and other diseases of arteries, arterioles and capillaries.
Individuals without available mortality follow-up data or
who died of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
(UCOD_113 16) were excluded from the study.

Statistical analysis
We compared the baseline characteristics of participants
by the status of ALD using chi-squared test for indepen-
dence. Periods of risk of death were defined in months for
each participant between NHANES III examination date
and the date of death or the end of follow-up (31 Decem-
ber 2006). Previous studies have shown that participants'
age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status and disease condi-
tions including obesity, DM/IR and hypertension were
associated with mortality.17 Cox proportional hazards
model was used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confi-
dence intervals for deaths from all causes, cardiovascular
disease and liver disease by status of ALD. To examine the
amount of alcohol consumption on the survival of patients
with ALD, stratified analyses by levels of alcohol con-
sumption were conducted. Each model was adjusted for
major demographic and clinical confounders including
age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking history, obesity, diabetes/
insulin resistance and hypertension. Exploratory analyses
revealed that the effect of obesity on mortality varied
across age groups; therefore, the interaction between age
and obesity was included in the multivariate model. Statis-
tical significance was set at P < 0.05.
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey is based on a complex multistage probability
sample design. The sampling weights incorporate the dif-
ferential probabilities of selection and include adjust-
ments for noncoverage and nonresponse. Sample weights
together with stratification and clustering were incorpo-
rated into our analysis to estimate variances and test for
statistical significance.6 All analyses were performed
using stand alone SUDAAN 10.0 (RTI International,
Research Triangle Park, NC, USA).
RESULTS
After applying the exclusion criteria, a total of 8306 par-
ticipants remained in the analytical samples. Both groups
on average were young (age was 40.24 Æ 1.92 for ALD
patients, and 41.56 Æ 0.39 for Non-ALD participants).
Table 1 summarises the characteristics of participants
according to their diagnosis.
The impact of excessive alcohol use on mortality
The median follow-up was 178.27 months for persons
with alcohol-related liver disease, and 175.35 months for
their controls. At the end of the follow-up, 13.86%
persons with ALD died. Their deaths were attributed to
cardiovascular disease 2.33% and liver disease 0.76%. In
contrast, 11.25% of persons without ALD died. These
include 3.48% cardiovascular deaths and 0.15% liver-
related deaths.
The unadjusted hazard of liver-related death was sig-
nificantly higher for persons with ALD as compared with
those without ALD (HR, 4.95, 95% CI, 1.43­17.18,
P = 0.01). After adjusting for the other covariates in the
multivariate analysis, ALD was associated with even
higher risk of liver-related death (HR, 7.06; 95% CI,
2.09­23.79, P < 0.01) (Table 2).
On the other hand, the unadjusted analysis showed that
ALD was not associated with increased risk of all-cause

mortality (HR, 1.21, 95% CI, 0.76­1.91, P = 0.42). Com-
pared with the controls, the risk of cardiovascular mortal-
ity tended to be lower for patients with ALD (HR, 0.66,
95% CI, 0.15­2.79, P = 0.57); however, the association
was not statistically significant. Additional adjustment for
the other variables did not materially alter the results in
the Cox model (Table 2).
It is important to note that for individuals with ALD,
liver disease was the top cause of death, accounting for
18.5% of all deaths. On the other hand, among partici-
pants without ALD or any other liver diseases, the top
cause of death was cardiovascular disease, which
accounted for 32.5% of all deaths (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
This study used population data collected for
NHANES III to assess the impact of ALD on overall
mortality and cause-specific mortality in the US gen-
eral population. These data show that patients with
ALD are at increased risk for liver-related mortality,
but not for overall mortality or cardiovascular mortal-
ity. In this population-based analysis, subjects with
ALD were more likely to be of age 55­64 (non-ALD
had a higher proportion of >65), male, and have Mex-
ican American and non-Hispanic white ethnicity than
controls.
Despite the increased prevalence of vascular risk fac-
tors such as smoking, insulin resistance and hyperten-
sion, liver disease proved to be the most common cause
of death in the ALD population, accounting for 18.5% of
all deaths. This is different from a similar popula-
tion-based analysis of patients with non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD).17 Using the same NAHNES III
database, NAFLD patients have been shown to have a
higher overall mortality compared with the general pop-
ulation, with cardiovascular disease being the primary
cause of death, accounting for 25% of all deaths.18 Our
study showed that the ALD population did not have an

increased risk for overall mortality or cardiovascular
mortality, but only liver-related mortality.
One possible explanation for the cardiovascular out-
comes noted in this trial is the previously observed bene-
fit of alcohol consumption and the reduction in
cardiovascular events.19, 20 A recent meta-analysis
showed the minimal dose of wine at which maximal pro-
tection could be obtained for cardiovascular mortality to
be 24 g/day, with similar findings for beer consump-
tion.19 A more recent study found that the possible
mechanistic reason for the cardioprotective effect of a
moderate use of alcohol was related to the AKT and
nuclear factor (NRF2) mechanism to regulate the oxida-
tive stress response.10 As ALD was presumed in partici-
pants who reported alcohol use greater than 20 g/day
with elevated liver enzymes, we can assume that the
ALD population in this study would experience the
potential benefits described. Also, in the largest prospec-
tive study of alcohol use and mortality, the greatest
reduction in mortality from coronary artery disease
occurred among drinkers who had the presence of heart
disease, stroke or other pre-existing risk of cardiovascular
disease at enrolment, which were characteristics with a
high prevalence in ALD cohort.21
In patients at risk for liver disease, any possible benefit
from a cardiovascular perspective seems to be countered
by the significantly higher risk of liver-related mortality.
Of the patient characteristics associated with a higher
risk of liver-related mortality, only advanced age proved
to be statistically significant.
Despite its long-term follow-up and in-depth clinical
and mortality data, our study does have some weak-
nesses. The most important weakness is the relative
small sample size of patients with ALD, which may
have led to our inability to show some important
potential associations as well as being responsible for
the large confidence interval seen in some of the hazard
ratios. Nevertheless, the long-term follow-up mortality
data make this study quite unique and important. It is
also important to recognise that the NHANSES III data-
base is based on a complex multistage probability sam-
ple design. The sampling weights incorporate the
differential probabilities of selection and include adjust-
ments for noncoverage and nonresponse. Different
weights may be associated with each individual in the
survey. After applying weights in the analysis, the same
observed events may end up with different estimated
rates.15
In summary, our study finds that patients with ALD
are at an increased risk for liver-related mortality. This
recognition of ALD as an important cause of preventable
mortality at the population level should prompt the
availability of resources to address this important public
health issue both nationally and globally.
