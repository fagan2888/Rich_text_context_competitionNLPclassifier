A series of national surveys since 1982 have examined health needs of elders. Small proportions of minority elders in
each sample have limited our understanding of service use by minorities. This research sought to determine (1) the
extent to which minorities have restricted use of community long-term care services as a result of socioeconomic
status,family structure, and health status, and (2) the replicability and validity of results across three national surveys:
Supplement on Aging, National Long-Term Care, and National Medical Expenditure. Results indicate no bivariate or
multivariate differences between African American, Hispanic, or Whitefrail olderpersons in use of community long-
term services. Living arrangements, Medicaid use, and overall health andfunctional status wereprimary predictors of
service use. Taking methodological limitations into account, the results suggest similarity in processes influencing use
of community long-term care servicesfor African American and White older persons.
THE policy dilemma of maintaining fiscal constraints in
the face of growing long-term care needs requires ade-
quate data on the social and health characteristics of all older
persons. The underrepresentation of minority persons in
national surveys of the elderly seriously limits our under-
standing of how minorities use informal and formal care
services. These groups are a major public policy interest
because they contain high proportions of economically dis-
advantaged persons who rely on publicly financed services
(Chen, 1991). Public financing has traditionally supported
institution-based services, but the appropriateness of this
emphasis is under debate. Home- and community-based
services have expanded as a result of rising costs of nursing
home care, shifts in Medicare and Medicaid policies, and
individuals' desires to remain in the community as long as
possible.
A series of national surveys since 1982 have examined the
health and welfare needs of older persons. Yet, the propor-
tion of minority elders included within each sample is
relatively small, limiting development of service-use
models. We address this limitation by developing compara-
tive models for multiple data sets that examine two research
objectives:
1. To determine the effect of socioeconomic status, family
structure, and health status on long-term care service use
by minority groups.
2. To determine the replicability and validity of results
across three national data sets: Supplement on Aging
(SOA), the National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTC),
and the National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES).
After a review of the prevalence and predictors of use of
community long-term care services, we discuss the advan-
tages of using multiple data sets to replicate results. We
present the results of logistic regressions of determinants of
use of in-home services, senior centers, and any community-
based long-term care service by data set. Because of insuf-
ficient data, these results are limited to comparisons between
African Americans and White older persons. We then pool
the results across data sets to include comparisons with
Hispanics.
Prevalence of Use of Community Long-Term Care Services
A review of available data about use of long-term care
services illustrates the lack of adequate minority compari-
sons. As is well known, 70-80 percent of the care of
noninstitutionalized frail older persons is provided by family
members, friends, and other informal supports, with supple-
mentary assistance from formal services (Horowitz, 1985;
Stone, Cafferata, and Sangl, 1987). This pattern applies to
racial/ethnic groups as well, although there are race and
ethnic variations in the composition of the informal support
structure (Cantor, 1979; Mindel, Wright, Jr., and Starrett,
1986; Taylor and Chatters, 1986; White-Means and Thorn-
ton, 1990). Depending on definition of population at risk and
services counted, national estimates of formal service use
range from 25 to 36 percent (Short and Leon, 1990; Soldo,
Agree, and Wolf, 1989). Only a small proportion (5-10%),
however, rely exclusively on formal helpers. Estimates based
on statewide surveys or local populations tend to be higher,
reflecting in part differences in sampling, service definitions,
and geographical variability in service availability (Coward
and Dwyer, 1991; Soldo, Agree, and Wolf, 1989).
Detailed prevalence data by type of service confirm the
relatively low use of formal services by all frail older
persons. The 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey
provided the most comprehensive national estimates of types
of services used by persons ages 65 and older with any
S70

functional difficulties (Short and Leon, 1990). Home care
(i.e., homemaker services, home health aides, and other in-
home medical services) was the most commonly used ser-
vice (19.7%), with less than 10 percent using senior centers,
congregate meals, home meal preparation, phone checks, or
transportation. The most frequent users were 85 years or
older, were female, lived alone, had difficulty in several
activities of daily living, and were likely to be covered by
Medicaid. Over 50 percent of those who had difficulty in
three or more ADLs did not receive any formal services
(Short and Leon, 1990). Their report, however, did not
analyze racial/ethnic group differences.
National prevalence estimates of service use among el-
derly African Americans are available from the SOA and
NLTC surveys. Kart (1991) used a broad definition of long-
term care services that included help from relatives, friends,
paid professionals, or community services. Approximately
15 percent of aged African Americans received help with
special meals, used senior centers or transportation services;
25 percent received help with heavy work, shopping, or
homemaker services; and less than 5 percent used home
health services (Kart, 1991). In the 1982 NLTC survey of
chronically disabled older persons, 17 percent of African
Americans and 18 percent of Whites had informal and
formal sources of assistance with ADL and IADL tasks.
About 4 percent of both races used only formal services for
assistance (Miller, McFall, and Campbell, 1994).
Little consistent national information is available about
community long-term care service use by Hispanic elders.
Estimates of use vary. Some studies suggest no difference in
use of formal services between Hispanic older persons and
non-Hispanic Whites (Hing and Bloom, 1990), and others
identify less use by Hispanic elders (Kemper, 1992). Defini-
tional problems exist as a result of the internal heterogeneity
and geographical clustering of the major subgroups within
the Hispanic culture (Giachello, Bell, and Aday, 1983;
Markides, Coreil, and Rogers, 1989). Significant differ-
ences in use of long-term care services among Mexican
Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans were noted in two
national surveys of Hispanic older persons (Lacayo, 1980;
Wallace, Campbell, and Lew-Ting, 1994).
Community-based studies of race differences in service
use also produce inconsistent results. A review of behavioral
studies of a variety of health and long-term care services
provided little evidence that race or ethnicity had a main
effect on use of health care services in the multivariate
context (Wan, 1989; see also Mui and Burnette, 1994).
Other studies reported that non-Whites were more likely to
use home care services than Whites (Bass and Noelker,
1987; Evashwick et ah, 1985; Mindel, Wright, Jr., and
Starrett, 1986). Thus, there is little evidence of unequal
access by race to community long-term care services.
Predictors of Long-Term Care Service Use
The decision to use formal services is complex. It presup-
poses definition of need of help, knowledge of sources of
help, and subjective cost/benefit ratios of use by frail older
persons and their family caregivers. Many empirical studies
of service use draw on the conceptual framework of the
Andersen behavioral model (Andersen and Aday, 1978; An-
dersen and Newman, 1973). This framework views use of
health care services as a function of predisposing, enabling,
and need characteristics. The most consistent results of stud-
ies using this model are that: (a) need for service because of
health and functional status largely drives use of medical
services and, to a slightly smaller extent, use of long-term
care services (Miller and McFall, 1991; Wolinsky, 1990),
and (b) once need for service has been taken into account,
age, marital status, living arrangements, and income tend to
be the most significant predictors of use of formal services
(Soldo, Agree, and Wolf, 1989). Summaries discussing the
major predictors of long-term care services in specific mi-
nority groups also reveal inconsistent patterns of use (e.g.,
African American elderly: Jackson, 1988b; Taylor et al.,
1990; Hispanic elderly: Markides, 1989; Sotomayor and
Curiel, 1988; comparative summaries: Stanford and Torres-
Gil, 1991; Minority Elders: Longevity, Economics, and
Health, 1991).
We focus on three classes of predictors from the behav-
ioral model: (1) family composition and household structure
(predisposing); (2) income and insurance (enabling); and (3)
health and functional status (need). Minority groups tend to
have larger extended families and more multigenerational
contacts, although variations exist within and between so-
cioeconomic levels within groups (Markides and Mindel,
1987; Mitchell and Register, 1984;Mutran, 1985; Smerglia,
Deimling, and Barresi, 1988). Older Whites and African
Americans are more likely to live alone (approximately
32%) compared to 22 percent of elderly Mexican Americans
and other Hispanics, and 17 percent of Puerto Ricans (Angel
andHogan, 1991).
Older African American and Hispanic adults compared to
their White counterparts have greater poverty and less edu-
cational attainment. In 1990, 12.2 percent of all elderly were
poor; the rate for Whites was 10.1 percent, for African
Americans, 33.8 percent, and for Hispanics, 22.5 percent
(Chen, 1991). Sources of income also vary by race/
ethnicity. For example, Whites and African Americans are
more likely to receive Social Security than Hispanics. About
5 percent of elderly Whites receive public assistance, com-
pared to over 25 percent of African Americans and 22
percent of Hispanics (Chen, 1991). By most measures, the
health of older African Americans and Hispanics is poorer
than that of older Whites (Manuel, 1988; Jackson, J. J.,
1988; Sotomayor and Randolph, 1988). These social differ-
ences indicate the need for long-term care and the availabil-
ity of informal support within each racial/ethnic group.
Because the three national data sets analyzed in this study
contain detailed measures of household composition, family
structure, economic status, and health status, we will be able
to address the important question of how community long-
term care choices made by African American and Hispanic
frail older persons are influenced by their economic well-
being and by family structure.
Advantages of Multiple Data Sets
Examination of results across national studies in compara-
tive individual analyses and in pooled analyses provides
verification of similarities and differences in patterns of
service use. Pooling data allows for examination of popula-

tions insufficiently represented in an individual data set.
Despite differences in sampling frames and question design,
there are real gains to be realized from the use of multiple
data sources. If findings replicate within reasonable limits
across surveys with design and mechanical differences, we
can have more confidence in the results. Although differ-
ences in question wording are known to have effects upon
estimates of rates (Wiener et al., 1990), the extent to which
these differences affect estimates of associations and causal
effects is less clear. For example, research on status attain-
ment, in which the basic model has been replicated across
many different kinds of sampling and measurement
schemes, shows that the results are amazingly robust (Camp-
bell, 1983). If similar results can be shown in the present
case, confidence in their reliability will be enhanced. Even
more importantly, if results are not similar, our ability to
base policy directions on these data may be suspect.
METHOD
Sample
We selected subsamples of cases from each data set,
guided by the goal of ensuring as much comparability in
sample definition as possible. Our analytic sample consisted
of individuals aged 70 and older who had at least one
limitation in ADL or IADL. In this way, we matched the age
restriction in SOA and the sampling frames defined by frailty
used by the NLTC and the long-term care supplement of the
NMES. Since community long-term care services are most
heavily used by older and frailer persons, these restrictions
are appropriate. The comparative analyses within data set
are restricted to African Americans and Whites because of
the relatively few Hispanics in the SOA in = 87) and NMES
samples (n = 34) and no defined Hispanics in the NLTC (see
Table 1). A power analysis indicated that relevant compari-
sons could be made between African American and White
subsamples in all three data sets. Because we did not have
sufficient numbers of Hispanics in any data set for compara-
tive analysis, we combined data from all three data sets to
examine Hispanic/African American/White differences.
SOA. -- The Supplement on Aging (SOA), a supplement
to the 1984 annual Health Interview Survey (HIS),
telephone-surveyed community-dwelling individuals aged
55 years or older. The SOA followed up those persons aged
70 and over from this sample in 1986, 1988, and 1990 (see
Fitti and Kovar, 1987, for details on the SOA sample design
and procedures). In this report, we used weighted data based
on interviews with 2,725 respondents to the 1984 SOA. We
drew on the parent Health Interview Survey for our measures
of health self-report and income to minimize missing data
and proxy reports. The SOA analytic subsample included
White (unweighted n = 2,465) and African American (un-
weighted n = 260) respondents.
NLTC. -- The National Long-Term Care survey (NLTC)
investigated the demographic characteristics, health and
functioning, and patterns of assistance of a national sample
of noninstitutionalized frail persons 65 years of age or older.
A random sample of approximately 36,000 persons drawn
from Medicare enrollment files was screened in 1982 to
identify persons with functional limitations, defined as the
inability to perform at least one activity of personal care
(ADL) or management of daily affairs (IADL) for a period of
3 months or more. Over 6,400 persons were identified, and
95.3 percent were interviewed. This sample was foliowed-
up in 1984 and 1989. In addition, subsamples of the
nondisabled-community residents identified in 1982 and
those passing their 65th birthday by April 1, 1984 were
screened and interviewed in 1984.
The NLTC analytic subsample consisted of White (n =
3,638) and African American (n = 513) frail older persons
aged 70 and older. There was no significant difference by
race in the exclusion of those aged 65 to 69 years. (See
Manton, 1988, and Manton, Corder, and Stallard, 1993, for
detailed discussions of the 1984 survey methodology.)
NMES. -- The National Medical Expenditures Survey
(NMES) was based on a national stratified area probability
design. After screening, the sample contained approxi-
mately 15,000 households; 36,000 individuals were selected
to permit unbiased national estimates for the noninstitutiona-
lized population as well as separate estimates for elderly,
poor, and near poor; African Americans and Hispanics; and
persons with functional limitations. Approximately 1,300

persons 65 and older who reported functional difficulties
were interviewed. Four rounds of personal and telephone
interviews occurred at 4-month intervals for the study refer-
ence year of 1987. A long-term care supplement was admin-
istered during the first and fourth interviews; data in this
report are from the first interview. Only those older persons
who reported at least one limitation in ADLs or IADLs or
walking received the long-term care supplement (see Cohen,
DiGaetano, and Waksberg, 1991; Leon and Lair, 1990, and
Short and Leon, 1990, for detailed discussions of NMES
methodology). The NMES analytic subsample consisted of
727 White frail older persons and 142 African Americans
aged 70 and over with difficulty in at least one ADL or
walking. There was no significant difference by race in the
exclusion of those aged 65 to 69 years.
Although the analytic subsamples are comparable in age
range and frailty status, other remaining differences should
be kept in mind. Selection effects remain a plausible alterna-
tive explanation for any differences found between the data
sets (Nesselroade, 1988). First, the definitions of frailty used
in the SOA and NMES do not include the restriction to
chronicity (defined as 3 months limitation or more) used in
the NLTC. Second, there is a 3-year difference between the
data collection for the SOA and NLTC, on the one hand, and
the NMES on the other.

ways was area size. NMES did not include any measures for
number of children. Family income, education, and self-
health ratings had sufficient missing data to warrant imputa-
tion of missing data. The missing values for education
(SOA, 1.8%; NLTC, 4.5%; NMES, 4%) were imputed to
age- and race-specific means. Missing data for income
(SOA, 17.8%; NLTC, 9.7%) were imputed to mean values
by level of education and race. Missing cases of self-health
ratings (SOA, 0.7%; NLTC, 7.7%) were assigned the global
mean value. Missing values in income and self-health rat-
ings in NMES were imputed prior to data tape release.
Our choice of measures was guided by two principles:
reliability of the SES, family structure, and health measures;
and availability and comparability of measures across data
sets. As a result of the latter criteria, variables required
measurement at their broadest level, minimizing differences
in detail that may have been present in one of the data sets.
For example, because there were no asset data available in
SOA, asset data from NLTC and NMES could not be
included in our measures of economic status. Similarly,
SOA had more detailed information about household struc-
ture than was available in the NLTC or NMES data. (See
Wolinsky, 1994, for a discussion of other measurement
limitations.)
Limitations were apparent in measurement of our depen-
dent variables. Each survey asked about different sets of
community long-term care services and used different time
referent periods for use (see below for details). We therefore
selected the minimum service cluster that could be identified
in each data set for separate analysis. We are not sure of the
effect of different referent time periods on results. We can
expect that the proportion using a service in the past year
would differ from the proportion using that service the
previous month. It is not clear, however, if the patterns of
predictors of use would vary by referent time period across
data sets.
All three surveys included indicators of selected home
based services. The SOA asked about in-home health ser-
vices during the past 12 months, identifying users of visiting
nurse services (8.4%), health aide (5.0%), homemaker
(3.9%), and home-delivered meals (5.2%). The NLTC asked
only about home nursing services during the past month
(8.7% use). In NMES, 6 percent used home-delivered meals
and 13.1 percent had a home health aide on a regular basis.
Use of senior centers on a regular basis was measured in the
SOA, NLTC, and NMES. In NMES, however, the number
using senior centers was too small for individual data set
analysis. We also created a catch-all dichotomous variable to
represent use of any service mentioned in the data set. The
definition and number of services varied by data set. For
example, in SOA and NLTC, use of transportation was
restricted to travel to senior centers; in NMES, use of
transportation included travel to senior centers, day care
centers, and special transportation. The proportions using
each of the nonitemized services were low, less than 3
percent each.

are not included in this table. Whites have similar distribu-
tions in all the data sets on age, gender, education, region,
living arrangements, and number of children. White older
persons in the SOA are slightly more likely to have private
insurance and less likely to be on Medicaid than their
counterparts in the NLTC. Frail older White persons in
NMES are similar to those in NLTC in age, education,
percent female, region, percent receiving Medicaid, and
mean number of IADL limitations. But those in the NMES
survey are more likely to have private insurance, have higher
incomes, and live alone with higher mean number of related
household members than their counterparts in the NLTC.
African Americans in SOA and NLTC have similar distri-
butions on age, education, region, proxy status, living
alone, number in household, and number of children. Afri-
can Americans in the SOA are somewhat more likely to be
female, more likely to have private insurance, and less likely
to be on Medicaid than their counterparts in NLTC. African
Americans in NMES appear to be more highly educated,
with higher incomes and private insurance and larger family
size than the NLTC sample. African Americans and Whites
in SOA report slightly fewer limitations in ADL, IADL, and
physical performance abilities, but similar self-health ratings
than those in NLTC. The lower mean number of ADL
limitations in NMES is a result of fewer ADLs being
counted.
Within each survey, race differences in sociodemographic
variables are similar to those noted in other studies. Thus,
given the accumulation of lifetime differentials in social and
economic resources, Whites have higher education levels,
higher income, greater likelihood of private insurance, and
less likelihood of Medicaid than African Americans or
Hispanics. African Americans are more likely than Whites
to reside in Southern states. Household arrangement differ-
entials between Whites and African Americans are similar in
all data sets, i.e., African Americans are less likely to be
married or live alone. The average number of children does
not differ by race. Health status differentials are minimal
across the data sets.
Analytic Strategy
As Wolinsky et al. (1990) note, analyses which seek to
S76 MILLER ETAL.
assign variance to race and/or ethnicity are not particularly
informative for two reasons: First, one wants to know why
there are differences. Race and ethnicity in and of them-
selves are not explanatory variables. Second, one wants to
understand how a process differs across groups. Both ques-
tions require one to specify a set of intervening variables
between race/ethnicity on the one hand and the outcome of
interest on the other. If the coefficients on dummy variables
representing racial and ethnic groups go to zero after the
inclusion of intervening variables, then we argue (assuming
correct specification of the model) that we have explained
the group differences. Similarly, if we can show that coef-
ficients of a presumed causal model differ across race/ethnic
groups, then, in a different sense, we have explained group
differences. If the race variable remains significant after
entering the other model variables, we can conclude that
other explanatory variables are needed to interpret how race/
ethnicity affects use of services.
Because of the dichotomous nature of the dependent
variables, we used logistic regression as our primary analytic
method. All three data sets had complex multistage sample
designs with some degree of clustering. Thus, standard
errors based on simple random sampling assumptions will be
too small. All estimates were computed taking sample de-
sign into account, using the Research Triangle Institute's
SUDAAN software (Shah et al., 1991).
Our general strategy was to begin with a simple bivariate
model examining race differences only, and then to intro-
duce sequentially "intervening variables" intending to ac-
count for those differences. Each model contained all the
variables in the preceding model. The order of "intervening
variable models" was (1) Race only; (2) Sociodemographic:
gender, age, education, region, rural/urban, and proxy re-
spondent; (3) Economic: income, private insurance, and
Medicaid; (4) Family structure: living arrangement, number
in household, number of children; (5) Health status: ADLs
and IADLs, self-reported health, and physical performance
limitations.
This hierarchical order modified the usual causal sequence
implied by the Andersen behavioral framework of service
use (Andersen and Newman, 1973; Wolinsky and Johnson,
1991). First, because of our recognition that race is a marker
variable that represents many complex societal processes,
we introduced race alone to determine its global effect before
partialling out compositional differences. Social and demo-
graphic characteristics of gender, race, and education in-
fluence the distribution of personal resources. Service avail-
ability varies by geographic region. Thus, this block of
variables was entered next. Because the socioeconomic
interpretation of race differences is dominant in social sci-
ence literature, we introduced income as an implied causal
step prior to the predisposing variables of household compo-
sition and informal network characteristics. Prior research
has shown conclusively that need, i.e., health and functional
status, is the major determinant of use of services by older
persons. By introducing these variables last, we have the
opportunity to examine more closely the ways in which
social factors explicate the meaning of race. Since this is
cross-sectional data, any causal implications implied by this
order are suggestive only.
Our final step was to determine if the process influencing
the use of each long-term care service cluster differed by
race. We created multiplicative interaction terms of race by
significant predictors of service use and tested these glob-
ally. If the global test on the set of interaction terms was sig-
nificant, we looked at individual product terms.
RESULTS
Prevalence of Use of Community Long-Term Care Services
Table 4 presents the percentage of use of community long-
term care services by race. These data are presented for
descriptive purposes only. Because of subtle differences in
number and type of service included within the measurement
of each summary service type, the proportions are not
directly comparable. Thus, the lower proportions using
services, regardless of race in NLTC, are a result of restric-
tions and differential time referents of our operational defini-
tions. The relatively limited use of community long-term
care services leads to potentially unstable estimates of ser-
vice use by minority group within data set. Essentially,
however, there were no differences by race in use of home-
based services, senior centers, or any service.
African American and White Differences by Data Set
Although race differences were not found at the bivariate
level, the possibility of differential effects in the multivariate
context remains. We ran five hierarchical models for each of
the three dependent variables of service use. As noted
earlier, we began with a model containing race differences,
then added sets of variables thought to influence the relation-
ship between race and service use. The odds ratio may be
interpreted as the odds of using a service of one category of a
particular independent variable compared to the odds of
using the same service for a different category of the inde-
pendent variable. Values greater than 1 indicate higher
likelihood of use, and values less than 1 indicate lower
likelihood of use (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 1989).
One final note is required regarding the income variable.
We tested for both linear and nonlinear effects of income. In

MINORITY USE OF COMMUNITY LONG-TERM CARE S77
SOA and NMES, the effect of income on the odds of use of
home-based services and any services was nonlinear and
quadratic. Thus, service use was higher at very low levels
and at high levels of income, and lower in the middle levels.
We assume that this occurs because low-income respondents
are eligible for free services, and high-income respondents
can afford private services (Stoller and Cutler, 1993).
Table 5 summarizes the odds ratios of each type of service
use for African Americans compared to White older persons.
There were no significant race differences in any of the
models in any of the data sets for any service use variable.
Furthermore, the variations in odds ratios by models seem
relatively random with one exception. Within NMES, as
more variables are entered into the regression of home-based
services, the relative odds of African Americans using
home-based services compared to Whites declined. This
pattern did not occur in the other two data sets. This decline
may lack statistical significance because of the relatively
small sample size of frail older persons in this survey.
Table 6 summarizes the final models of predictors of
community long-term care service use. The only consistent
predictors of home-based services across the three data sets
were education, use of Medicaid, and number of IADL
limitations. A subset of predictors was significant in the
SOA and the NLTC surveys: age, self-health rating, and
number of ADL limitations. Living alone was a significant

predictor only in NMES. In summary, home-based services
were used primarily by those with poorer health who re-
ceived Medicaid and lived alone. Other influences on use of
home-based services were significant in only one data set.
Living in a rural community and number of ADL limita-
tions were consistent predictors of use of senior centers in
the SOA and NLTC. Those with fewer limitations were
more likely to participate in senior center programs. The
effect of living in a rural community, however, varied by
data set. Those living in rural communities in the SOA show
a relatively- greater likelihood of use of senior centers com-
pared to urbanized areas, wherein those sampled in NMES
show a relatively smaller likelihood of use. Since the defini-
tion of urban/rural varies by data set (see Table 2), any
conclusions about the association between rural setting and
senior center use remain tentative.
In SOA, greater likelihood of using senior centers oc-
curred among those living in Western regions compared to
the Midwest, rural areas, those living alone but having more
children, and with fewer ADL and IADL limitations. In the
NLTC, greater likelihood of use of senior centers occurred
among women, more populated communities, private insur-
ance, and in better health with fewer ADL limitations. The
predictors converge in providing a picture of senior center
participants that represents the healthier end of the older
person spectrum.
The pattern of predictors of use of any services was
inconsistent across the data sets. These results may reflect
the varied type and number of services included in each
study. Those who live in the South were least likely to use
services. The most consistently significant predictors across
data sets were use of Medicaid, living alone, and number of
functional limitations.
The final models were tested for interaction between race
and the other predictors to explore if the process influencing
service use varied by race. No significant interactions by
race were identified. We thus conclude that African Ameri-
cans and Whites exhibit more similarities than differences in
the processes influencing use of community long-term care
services.
Hispanic Use of Community Long-Term Care Services
Data were pooled from the three data sets to create a
sufficient number of Hispanic respondents for analysis. The
number of Hispanic older persons, however, remained small
with insufficient power for detecting small differences be-
tween Hispanics and Whites or African Americans. We
include the results for illustrative purposes and as a further
check on consistency of results across data sets.
The pooled data represent a different sample than those
defining the individual data sets. We recalculated the num-
ber of ADL and IADL limitations to include only identical
items in the summary scales. The sample definition of the
pooled data is older people who have any ADL/IADL
limitation on the new list of 11 potential limitations. The
final composition of the pooled data was 6,597: 100 (1.5%)
Hispanic; 739 (11.2%) African American; and 5,758
(87.3%) White. The data were not weighted because of the
differing survey distributions. The inclusion of race, age,
gender, and region in the analysis minimizes sampling
design effects. Because we could not use the SUDAAN
software (Shah et al., 1991) for the pooled data, we verified
the significance levels through bootstrapping models (details
on request; Mooney and Duval, 1993).
For comparability we redefined selected variables. We
changed the dependent variables to represent (a) combined
use of visiting nurse and health aide services, and (b) senior
centers. We omitted the following variables because of
variations in definitions: urban/rural/SMSA, number of chil-
dren, and number of household members. We restricted the
scale of physical performance to three items. Dummy vari-
ables controlling for the effect of data set differences were
added to the model.
Table 7 presents the results of the pooled logistic regres-
sions. Whites were the omitted reference group for race. No
race or ethnic differences in service use were found. The
results in the pooled analysis were similar to those identified
in the individual data set analyses, net of differences in data
set characteristics. Older, more highly educated persons
who lived outside the South or West, had private insurance
or Medicaid, were living alone, and in poorer physical
health were relatively more likely to use visiting nurse/
home health services. Senior center participation was more
likely found among those who did not live in the South, had
Medicaid, were living alone, and were in better health. Yet,
the methodological artifact of differences in data set meth-
odology and sample size also had a significant effect. Thus,
all else being equal, respondents in NMES had a 3 times
higher relative odds of use of visiting nurse and health aide

DISCUSSION
This study examined the relationship between race/
ethnicity and use of community long-term care services in
three national data sets. No race/ethnicity differences in use
at the bivariate and multivariate level between African
Americans, Hispanics, and Whites were identified. Thus,
from the national policy perspective of fostering equal ac-
cess to community services for the elderly, little overt
discrimination or restricted access by race is apparent. One
of the advantages of testing similar models across data sets is
that the consistency of predictors provides greater con-
fidence in the robustness of findings. Our results confirm
predictors of community long-term care use identified in
other studies, e.g., living arrangement, health status, re-
gion, and insurance/income status (Soldo, Agree, and Wolf,
1989). The results also confirm the relatively low levels of
use of community long-term care services among the popu-
lation defined most at risk, i.e., those deficient in at least one
instrumental or physical activity of daily living.
The replication of our findings across the national data sets
and in the pooled analysis increases our confidence in their
validity. Yet, certain methodological limitations must be
noted. First, as national sample surveys, decisions made in
the data collection process may influence the results. Re-
cruitment of minorities into national samples is more likely
to occur in higher density minority areas, especially in urban
communities to minimize sampling costs (Jackson, 1988a).
Such areas may also contain a higher density of service
availability, an unmeasured but crucial factor in understand-
ing service use. Thus, estimates of use of services by
minorities may remain somewhat biased.
A second selection factor involves the restriction of our
study samples to those age 70 and over. Because of differen-
tial morbidity and mortality at earlier ages, proportionally
fewer minorities are alive at age 70 compared to their White
counterparts. The association between age and health and
functional status is linear among Whites, but nonlinear
among Blacks (Gibson and Jackson, 1992). Thus, our sam-
ples may represent hardier minority older persons compared
to a wider range of health status among older Whites.
A third limitation of these findings is inconsistency in
definitions of services and predictors across data sets. For
example, the categories of home-based services or use of any
service include service units that vary by amount of worker
training, source of payment, profit/non-profit status, etc.
Information about the service use process, such as knowl-
edge of services, access and eligibility issues, and availabil-
ity at the local level, is not included. Lack of information
about these matters may mask elements that are important in
assessing differences in question meaning and perception of
services by minority older persons. The lack of agreement in
service listings in these data sets also reflects not only
different decisions by survey designers, but also fragmenta-
tion in service delivery systems in the aging network.
A fourth methodological limitation is the different time
referents of use of service and the 3-year difference in data
collection time between the 1984 SOA and NLTC and the
1987 NMES. The difference in time referents suggests
potential for measurement error in respondent estimates, but
we do not believe these cognitive processes would vary by
race. The primary implication of difference in year of data
collection may be a change in the age distribution of the
population, but major shifts are unlikely in only 3 years.
Also, our models mix measures of current status with mea-
sures of service use at a prior time, leading to further
confusions in interpretation. Changes in Medicaid waiver
plans by states were occurring during this time.
The most important limitation of this and similar studies is
conceptual. Using race per se as a marker variable to repre-
sent unmeasured biological, social, cultural, and economic
characteristics is recognizably simplistic. As LaViest (1994)
notes, a race dummy variable measures only skin color and
does not capture within-group cultural and socioeconomic
heterogeneity or the societal health risk exposure and health/
illness behaviors that may influence service use. This re-
search included direct measures of socioeconomic status,
family structure, and selected health conditions. Selected
indicators of these risks had direct effects on service use, but
there was no evidence of race/risk interactions.
Researchers differ in interpreting race effects as indicative
of socioeconomic status, cultural context, or patterned dis-
crimination (Belgrave, Wykle, and Choi, 1993; Mutran,
1985; Wallace, 1990). There were no measures tapping the
cultural or discriminatory dimensions of race in these data
sets. There were, however, indicators of socioeconomic
status included in our models and evidence that government
and insurance programs linked to income were linked to
service use.
The most consistent socioeconomic predictor of higher
use of any type of service was Medicaid status. Medicaid is a
means-tested program for those living in poverty. Federally
and state funded but administered by the states, eligibility
standards, allocations, and coverage vary greatly, covering
only about one-half of those living in poverty (Estes, 1989).
Reflecting their lower income levels, older African Ameri-
cans were significantly more likely to be Medicaid recipients
than Whites and significantly less likely to have private
insurance coverage. To the extent that Medicaid status
indicates awareness of community services, this status may
facilitate higher use of services by African Americans that
balances the higher ability of many Whites to purchase
service directly (Stoller and Cutler, 1993).
Lack of economic resources as reflected in Medicaid status
may affect race differences in use in another way. Our results
clearly show that the amount of functional limitations was a
primary predictor of service use. As noted, from a policy
perspective, it appears that community long-term services are
engaging their target populations as intended. Yet, given the
higher mean levels of disability reported by African Ameri-
cans and the predictive importance of level of impairment on
use of long-term care services, we might legitimately expect
higher use by African Americans than Whites, notjust similar
rates. Medicaid status may contribute to this potential ineq-
uity. For example, Medicaid provides lower rates than private
insurance in most areas. Nursing homes, therefore, may be
more likely to discriminate against admitting Medicaid appli-

cants, contributing in part to the lower rates of nursing home
placement of older African Americans (Harrington Meyer,
1994). Medicaid recipients in the community may be espe-
cially frail and have more obvious service needs than those in
institutions, contributing to higher use of services among
African Americans.
In sum, the results of this study contribute to the debate
about adequacy of service accessibility for minority older
persons in two ways. First, we confirm the results of other
studies that race differences in service use are not apparent at
the national level. To the extent that access to services is
financially driven, the financial benefits of Social Security,
Medicare, and Medicaid appear to be accomplishing the goal
of increasing the ability of all older persons to use commu-
nity long-term care services. Clearly, any changes in these
programs or others that weaken the financial stability of
older minority adults or tighten service eligibility require-
ments will have negative consequences for minority use of
community long-term care.
Second, we illustrate the advantages and limitations of the
use of comparable models across national data sets. Analyz-
ing models across data sets provides a form of meta-analysis
in which the effect of predisposing, enabling, and need
factors on service use can be quantified and replicated. The
demonstrated consistency of findings increases our con-
fidence in their validity.
Our experience, however, leads us to question whether
analysis of national data sets is the appropriate level for
studying social policies relating to community-based long-
term service use. One likelihood is that important local
geographical differences in service use by minorities are
cancelled out in the aggregation to national data. Service use
is only one aspect of a complex process of interaction be-
tween individuals' definition/search for help and service
availability and accessibility. This process is embedded in
local and regional service delivery systems that are affected
by policy decisions made at each level. These issues may be
investigated more appropriately in community-based studies
that encompass individual and service delivery system char-
acteristics embedded in local cultural contexts (e.g., Logan
and Spitze, 1994). As did Wolinsky (1994), we conclude that
determining policy implications from analysis of national
data sets is limited without more adequate knowledge of
individual, family, and community decision-making pro-
cesses and availability of services. Our research program is
currently engaged in cognitive laboratory exercises of focus
groups and think-aloud sessions with minority older persons
to examine the cultural and linguistic meaning of selected
long-term care constructs. In this way, we hope to determine
additional and more culturally appropriate concepts of service
use to incorporate into future surveys of long-term care use.
