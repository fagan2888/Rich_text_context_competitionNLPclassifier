Abstract
This article explores cooperation between a commercial supermarket chain and an
environmental non-governmental organization linking it to consumer perception of
the ``The Super Animals'' collectable cards promotion initiative. The case study focuses
on one particular joint project involving Animal Cards that was initiated by the super-
market Albert Heijn and the World Wide Fund for Nature in The Netherlands. Based
on this case, environmental non-governmental organizations' strategic choices in the
context of contesting discourses of sustainability and consumption, as well as implica-
tions for environmental education, are addressed. This article combines three strands of
the literature ­ on sustainable consumption, on strategic cooperation between com-
mercial companies and environmental non-governmental organizations and on environ-
mental education. It is argued that the Animal Cards initiative presents an ambiguous
case by both attempting to enhance environmental awareness and promoting consump-
tion, opening up questions about the value of such cooperative ventures to the object-
ives of environmental education. It is concluded that cross-sector partnerships have the
potential to lead to improvements in corporate social responsibility and environmental

Introduction
Let us start this article with the vignette.
On a rainy October afternoon in 2012, a group of about a hundred parents have
gathered in the area in front of the Montessori school in Amsterdam to pick up
their children. At 1 minute past 3, a stream of the youngest children pours out into
the square and starts to noisily disperse in the crowd of waiting parents. A few
minutes later, the older children join their younger schoolmates in the square.
A number of children gather in groups, observably more boisterous than the chil-
dren who have joined their parents. They pull out stacks of cards and start trading.
``A seal for these two!'' ``I already have a seal!'' ``I'll trade you this giraffe
instead'' . . . Excitement is mounting, children push and shove.
A number of boys climb the monkey bars in the school playground, followed by
other children who shout excitedly: ``Strooien, strooien!'' [``Throw them around!'']
One of the boys pulls out his stack of cards, shows them to the group below, and
announces that he is going to tear the cards. Children below shout ``Don't tear
them'' and implore him to throw them down instead. The boy takes his time,
pulling out one card after another and showing each to the public, while children's
hands extend up in an effort to grab the cards. One girl almost succeeds in grabbing
a card, but the boy pulls it back and tears it into two, telling the girl to pick up the
pieces. Following the shouts of discontent from other spectators, the boy throws all
the cards in the air and they start to land like confetti in the outstretched hands of
the children who stand under the monkey bars.
``They are just like monkeys!'' ­ remarks a mother with a white scarf, standing
next to the researcher.
``I cannot wait till this promotion is over . . . '' ­ sighs another mother in red coat.
``Well, I think it's great!'' ­ interjects a third mother in a yellow coat excitedly.
``These are beautiful cards!''
``What about this trading?'' ­ ventures her husband.
``Trading is good for children's social skills . . . and this way they learn about
animals!'' ­ replies his wife. Their daughter runs toward them, excitedly waiving the
cards in the air.
``Isn't it some kind of Greenpeace promotion?'' ­ reflects the father.
``I think it's just the way to make us buy more stuff in the store'' ­ shrugs the
mother in the red coat. ``My kid wants to collect all those soft animals they sell
Kopnina 927
too!'' ­ reflects the white scarfed mother. ``I don't mind having them myself!'' ­ the
mother in a yellow coat offers.
``Greenpeace probably gets part of the proceeds'' ­ reflects the father and looks
at the researcher: ``Do you have any idea, does this Greenpeace or whatever it was
get part of the proceeds?'' ``Probably, in a way . . . '' ­ the researcher answers.
``Well, everybody's got to make a living!'' ­ the father reflects gaily.
``They are probably made in China'' ­ the mother in red coat sniffs and ventures
into the playground to disengage her child from the group of trading children.
This article links the literature and empirical observations on sustainable con-
sumption, strategic choices of environmental non-governmental organizations
(ENGOs) and business stakeholders, and environmental education (EE). The crit-
ical literature addresses issues associated with ``green'' consumption and locates
consumers and their practices in the cultural, social, and economic contexts
(Isenhour, 2010, 2012, 2015; Kopnina, 2011a, 2014; Wilk, 2002a, 2002b, 2004,
2009, 2010). We shall discuss how this critical literature interrogates the rhetoric
and assumptions of ethical consumption and its relationship to environmental
awareness.
Next, we shall examine the literature on strategic collaboration between ENGOs
and businesses, particularly in the Dutch context (Bos et al., 2013; Glasbergen,
2011, 2013; Kolk and Van Tulder, 2010; Van Huijstee et al., 2011; Van Huijstee
and Glasbergen, 2010a, b; Van Tulder et al., 2001). The purpose of this examin-
ation is to gain insight into the reasons why businesses and ENGOs cooperate
strategically and how different stakeholders relate to this cooperation. This litera-
ture is embedded within the broader research on ``green alliances'' between busi-
nesses and their suppliers, competitors, and other stakeholders (Arts, 2002; Crane,
1998; Hartman and Stafford, 1997; Shah, 2011). Such alliances have become
common in recent decades, raising concerns about the motives behind collaborative
partnerships between agencies whose relationships were traditionally antagonistic
(Arts, 2002).
While this literature explores green marketing strategies within stakeholder
theory and the networks model of industrial markets (e.g. Crane, 1998), critical
environmental interdependencies between commercial companies, NGOs, and con-
sumers are rarely examined. This article will examine interdependencies between
commercial companies, ENGOs, and consumers, and educational benefits of such
alliances to the consumer, focusing on the congruity of bonds between various
alliances in the context of sustainability.
The interest in the purpose of collaborations between businesses and ENGOs
introduces the third strand of literature on EE. EE normally refers to a learning
process that increases students' awareness and knowledge about the environment
and associated challenges, develops the necessary skills and expertise to address the
challenges, and fosters attitudes, motivations, and commitments to make informed
decisions (Tbilisi Declaration, 1978). While research in EE is very broad, dating
back a few decades to the first issues of The Journal of Environmental Education
928 Journal of Consumer Culture 16(3)
in 1969, this article will particularly draw upon the EE literature relevant to con-
sumption and environmental awareness.
We shall focus on the Super Animals collectable cards (hereafter referred to as
Animal Cards) promotion as a catalyst for the discussion on sustainability and
consumption. The Animal Cards grew out of the partnership between the Dutch
branch of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF; in Dutch Wereld Natuur Fonds or
WNF) and the Dutch supermarket Albert Heijn (AH).
This article addresses the case of the Animal Cards as an example of a collab-
orative effort between WWF and AH. As WWF claims that its cooperation with
AH serves an educational function, this article focuses on the educational effects of
the strategic collaboration between WWF and AH.
Case description
The WWF has offices in 90 countries and per March 2014 counted 910,000 donors.
In The Netherlands, these included a growing number of youth members, through
their membership of youth clubs such as WNF-Bamboekidz, WNF-Rangers, and
WNF-Lifeguards. Founded in 1887, AH is the oldest company owned and oper-
ated by Ahold and currently owns more than 850 stores and employs around
74,000 people, making it one of the largest employers in The Netherlands
(https://www.ahold.com/Media/Albert-Heijn.htm).
Since 2007, the partnership between these two organizations has developed ``to
help find solutions to a range of sustainability issues'' (Ahold, 2011). In March
2011, AH and WNF launched the Animal Cards promotion for the first time.
Supermarket customers could receive Animal Cards by spending 10 euros on gro-
ceries. The cards contained pictures and information about animals and were dis-
tributed in small paper­plastic packages of four cards. A plastic-coated collector's
album or a wooden box in which to store the full set of 204 Animal Cards could
also be purchased at the store. Additionally, a selection of soft toy animals with
WNF labels could be purchased (WNF, 2012c). AH announced that it would pay
the first 2 months of WNF membership subscription for customers who were
``inspired by the promotion'' (Ahold, 2011).
The success of this joint initiative in 2011 led to the second Animal Cards pro-
motion which was launched in October 2012 (Ahold, 2012). In 2012, there were 204
different cards in 17 different categories, ranging from ``animals with funny names''
to ``animals with crazy hair styles'' (Albert Heijn Koornneef, 2012). As in the
previous year, customers were encouraged to collect all the cards and buy newly
designed albums and boxes in which to keep them (Albert Heijn, 2012a). Instead of
the paper­plastic packages used in 2011, smaller paper attachments were used. In
total, 112 million packages containing four Animal Cards each and 800,000 col-
lection albums were produced (WNF, 2012a, 2012b; AH refused to provide
information).
Judging by postings by both AH and WWF, the partners considered the action
successful (Albert Heijn, 2012a, 2012b; WNF, 2012a, 2012b; WWF, 2012).

Both AH and WWF reported that their cooperation is going to stimulate sustain-
ability of the international production of palm oil, timber, paper, and soya, and
serves to stimulate the green economy. Both partners reported that their efforts
were targeted to stimulate sustainable production and consumption, with WWF
additionally emphasizing the role of environmental awareness that such cooper-
ation raises. AH, on the other hand, assumed benefit from the commercial success
of increased sales (although official numbers were not reported) or at least through
the ``greener'' image acquired through association with ENGO. The commercial
success of Animal Cards was not only evident from AH's sales but also from the
number of postings on Martplaats.nl (the largest on-line market platform in The
Netherlands, similar to e-Bay) offering Animal Cards collections since 2011
(Marktplaats, 2014).
Methodology
This research is based on a case study involving participant observation conducted
with upper elementary Montessori elementary school children aged between 7 and
10 years and their parents between September and December 2012. The school has
a population of 79 children and is located in a predominantly ethnically Dutch
well-to-do area in Amsterdam. The researcher approached the children and their
parents after school at regular intervals. While the researcher attempted to engage
in conversations with children independently of their parents or guardians, these
conversations were often conducted in mixed groups of children and parents.
Conversations with individual children were conducted with parental consent
and sometimes outside the school premises in their homes. Conversations with
parents were conducted with and without children present, within school premises
and at home. All names were changed.
The participant observation method was chosen because it enabled the
researcher to gain a close familiarity with the parents and children over an extended
period of time (Spradley, 1980). Children were chosen as ``stakeholders'' because,
first, the Animal Cards are targeted toward the children and, second, because
children can be seen as future ``potential'' customers or donors. The parents and
guardians were chosen because they were the ``financers'' of the Animal Cards and
presumably had an influence on their children's opinions and behavior.
The researcher spent a total of about 15 hours socializing with children and
parents outside the school area and about the same amount of time in the homes of
five families. Since this was a predominantly ethnographic descriptive study, dis-
course analysis was applied to organize the data in thematic clusters. Discourse
analysis involves recording interactions; transcribing the recorded material; formu-
lating claims about the conversational moves, structures and strategies demon-
strated in the interaction and then building an argument using transcript
excerpts that have been analyzed (Tracy and Mirivel, 2009: 153). The segments
of informal conversations were entered in notes. These were then analyzed to create
basic qualitative sections by coding key words or sentences. The researcher has
930 Journal of Consumer Culture 16(3)
filtered only those segments of observed behaviors and conversations that were
related to the children's and parent's attitudes toward ethical consumption or to
cooperation between commercial and non-profit sector organizations. The three
interlinked strands of literature are presented below and then linked to the case
study.
Consumption and sustainability
Richard Wilk (2009) has inquired, ``What makes human wants and needs grow?
How do things that were once distant luxuries ­ say, hot water ­ become basic
necessities that people expect on demand for civilized life?'' One of the possible
answers is that various retailers have discovered that triggering consumption is
relatively easy, despite religious, ideological, moral, and political barriers
(Kaplan, 2000; Kopnina, 2013b; Rees, 2008). Consumption is often used as a
social status marker since consumer products are symbolic objects through
which we communicate our social status. Marketing psychologists, economists,
and retailers have long discovered that goods are facilitators of symbolic commu-
nication and exploited the opportunities offered by the knowledge of human psych-
ology in devising marketing strategies to entice the consumers (Blowfield, 2013).
These marketing strategies are increasingly applied on the global scale. While
``raising the standard of living'' may be aimed at ending severe deprivation, trans-
lated into policy the expression is a euphemism for the global dissemination of
consumer culture (Crist, 2012: 141­142). The moral call for equal distribution of
wealth leads to a greater spread of consumerist culture. Unless the consumption
pattern in rich countries is made more sustainable, the crisis of resources is likely to
deepen (Rees, 2008).
``Sustainable,'' ``responsible,'' ``ethical,'' or ``green'' consumption may seem like
the silver bullet. The ``moral nature'' of objects can spring from the objects' social,
economic, environmental, and political contexts. Ethical consumers can be defined
as those whose decisions as to what to consume are shaped by their assessment of
the moral nature of that context (Carrier, 2012: 1).
Yet, even the most environmentally minded consumers find it difficult to con-
sume less or consume sustainably. In Confessions of an Eco-Sinner, Fred Pearce
(2008) set out to track down the people behind the production and distribution of
everything in his daily life. He discovered that awareness of unsustainability is not
enough to lead sustainable lifestyle. In the same spirit, Colin Beavan performed the
public experiment of ``extreme environmental living'' in the middle of Manhattan,
looking for alternatives to the typical American's consumption-based way of life.
The popular book No Impact Man has brought concerns about the social dimen-
sions of consumption to the fore (Beavan, 2009). One of the most acute observa-
tions was how Beavan's family and friends reacted to what they saw as his
extremely odd way of living.
In line with the ``rebound effect'' theory that states that green marketing drives
even more consumption (Greening et al., 2000), scholars have noted contradictions
Kopnina 931
of ``green consumption'' (e.g. Connolly and Prothero, 2008; Kopnina, 2014; Wilk,
2002a, 2002b, 2010). The contemporary emphasis on ``green consumerism'' might
also be driving more consumption as it aims to absolve consumers of their guilt but
fails in stopping over-consumption (Isenhour, 2010).
Wilk (2010) notes that there may even be a ``moral rebound effect'' where
reiterating the message creates guilt, which ``drives the continuing bulimic cycle
of binge and purge so characteristic of contemporary consumer culture'' (p. 42).
The concept of ``sustainable consumption'' has been a ``bit of jargon that allows
science to say one thing and the public to hear another'' (Wilk, 2010: 47). Green
consumption or ``capitalism with the human face'' can be a clever marketing trick
to avoid fundamental change (Zizek, 2010). In elaborating on the paradoxes of
sustainable consumption, Bryant and Goodman (2004) describe contrasting com-
modity cultures, namely, the Edenic myth-making culture used to assimilate con-
cerns over tropical deforestation in the South and the consumption-intensive
culture lifestyles in the North. Both are weakened as a form of social and political
``caring at a distance'' owing to the uncritical acceptance of consumption as the
primary basis of action.
Sustainable consumption may have only marginal benefits:
Many people will try a product that promises green benefits, but they will only make it
a routine part of their lives if it saves them money or time, increases their comfort, or
confers some kind of valued social status or recognition. On a more fundamental level,
people's everyday moral concerns are much more about other people in their imme-
diate social sphere than they are about the well-being of the planet or people in the
distant future. (Wilk, 2004: 14)
Isenhour (2010) notes that contrary to the contemporary dominance of theories
which link sustainable action to awareness, the most significant barrier to sustain-
able lifestyles concerns conformity, equality, and fairness. Purchasing decisions are
made in part because of people's inherited or learned habits (e.g. children following
their parents' consumption patterns), acquired habits (e.g. what consumers have
bought before), beliefs and assumptions (e.g. that a product is good for their
health), emotions (e.g. ``retail therapy''), social influences (e.g. what their peers
buy), and conformity to class expectations (e.g. products aimed to enhance one's
relational social standing) (Kopnina and Blewitt, 2014). Wilk (2004) has argued
that responsible consumption is not necessarily about ``reducing consumption'' per
se, but about making sure that the ``goods and services people buy, use and throw
away'' consume fewer resources (p. 27). For a very small segment of Western
consumers, ethical consumption means not consuming anything socially or envir-
onmentally damaging at all, as in the case of vegans. It is open to question how
``responsible'' the majority of consumers are when they choose between what is
cheap and what is ``right.''
Significantly, Miller (2001) noted that utopian fantasies about how much hap-
pier everyone would be if they gave up their cars and became vegetarians are not a
932 Journal of Consumer Culture 16(3)
substitute for sound public policy that will move the majority of society ­ not just a
committed fringe ­ toward a less environmentally destructive society. It is the
businesses and the governments that are the largest consumers, and individual
consumption decisions are insignificant in proportion. Thus, ``many consumption
decisions are not made by consumers at all, but by governments, regulatory agen-
cies, and businesses'' (Wilk, 2009: 4). Focus on individual responsibility reflects the
dominance of neoliberalism whereby governments delegate responsibility to con-
sumers and thus avoid politically unpopular decisions that would limit
consumption (Hobson, 2002). While the focus on market-based solutions makes
political sense, the current emphasis on lifestyle choices can be seen as a new
manifestation of the existing system and ultimately a strategy for the powerful to
resist the regulation of resource-intensive, polluting, or socially damaging products
(Isenhour, 2010: 457). Considering the growth of human population, the scope for
de-coupling growth in production and consumption from environmental degrad-
ation is limited. If left to open market mechanisms, sustainable consumption is
likely to fail.
One of the most hopeful political mechanisms is consumer choice editing
that denies consumers the chance to buy non-sustainable goods (Blowfield,
2013: 282). Whether companies' decisions to restrict consumer choice are taken
as a result of economic calculation or consumer pressure, consumer choice editing
avoids the thorny issue of relying on individual good will. However, this
option is rarely practiced in neoliberal democratic societies (Kopnina and
Blewitt, 2014).
Another opportunity lies in the ``sharing economy'' and consumption of experi-
ences and services rather than ownership (Tennant et al., 2015). Consumers can now
access an expanding number of sites providing opportunities to share cars, rooms,
items, and tasks. Social sharing sites for goods and services and leasing companies
could alter the nature of consumption to the less material forms. Yet, keeping a
product in use for longer implies that direct sales of new products decrease, impacting
profits that could otherwise be made (Tennant et al., 2015). Also, not everybody
wants to share, and many items can simply not be shared.
Another opportunity for sustainable consumption lies in the kind of production
system used. The new conception of the system of production design, in which
waste becomes impossible, is exemplified by the Circular Economy, Natural Step,
and the Cradle to Cradle frameworks (Kopnina, 2011a; Kopnina and Blewitt,
2014; Tennant et al., 2015).
Despite all these hopeful frameworks, there is still concern about the pricing of
sustainably produced goods and the question of whether sustainable choices can be
made available and affordable on the global scale. The challenge is to apply these
frameworks, despite the current social constraints and political status quo. Since
the individual consumer's sphere of influence can be too small to initiate significant
change and many consumers may be simply unwilling to consider sustainable
options, efforts to encourage sustainable living depend on structural changes that
require political and corporate leadership (Blowfield, 2013).
Kopnina 933
In essence, the fundamental question remains whether sustainable consumption
can be realized within the present market-based society and whether the WNF and
AH cooperation does anything to address these challenges. The same debate can be
observed in the ENGO community, with some ENGOs opting for strategic collab-
oration with business in order to reach their sustainability goals while operating
from within the system.
Strategic cooperation between companies and ENGOs
Traditionally, adversarial relations between business and ENGOs have given way
to increasingly collaborative strategies, including corporate philanthropy, corpor-
ate foundations, licensing agreements, sponsorships, transaction-based promo-
tions, joint issue promotions, and joint ventures (Wymer and Samu, 2003). The
motives for businesses to collaborate have been largely reputational (Bos et al.,
2013; Glasbergen, 2011, 2013; Van Huijstee et al., 2011; Van Tulder et al., 2001).
Motives for ENGOs to collaborate also included goal achievement and funding
(Kolk and Van Tulder, 2010; Kopnina and Blewitt, 2014; Van Huijstee et al., 2011;
Van Huijstee and Glasbergen, 2010a, b). Among others, advantages of collabor-
ation included more sustainable products and funding for environmental goals.
Such mutually beneficial collaboration can be exemplified by the joint effort of
the Dutch Rabobank and WNF to produce a climate-neutral credit card on the
basis of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects in 2001. This collabor-
ation was the result of the combination of the rising importance of climate change
as an issue, the intention of Rabobank's climate expert to develop a climate-neutral
consumer product, and the fact that consumers did not perceive the Rabobank as a
credible source of climate-related communication. All these factors strengthened
the rationale for promoting a climate-friendly consumer product alongside a cred-
ible organization such as WNF. This joint effort to stimulate green investment and
issue bank cards with WNF logos was targeted to provide the Rabobank with a
symbolic (i.e. reputational) gain. WNF, on the other hand, gained recognition by
a wider audience, as well as some modest gains in climate change mitigation (Van
Huijstee and Glasbergen, 2010a, b). ENGOs were seen to apply pressure to cor-
porations by using shareholder activism (Gritten and Mola-Yudego, 2010), simul-
taneously increasing shareholders' loyalty to a corporation that was seen to
cooperate with ENGOs, leading to mutual benefits.
Some observers, however, have blamed ENGOs for ``selling out'' (Figure 1) and
serving the interests of the elites (West, 2006). Risks of such cooperation included
marginalization of more critical and ambitious alternatives (Kopnina and Blewitt,
2014; Van Huijstee et al., 2011). The use of the terms ``natural capital,'' ``natural
resources,'' and ``ecosystem services,'' prominent in the rhetoric of corporations as
well as large ENGOs, is criticized for reducing complex natural and social
phenomena into priced and thereby tradable commodities whose priced value
is set from afar (Sullivan, 2009). ENGOs were blamed for siding with dominant
political and corporate elites and instituting corporate conservation as the only
934 Journal of Consumer Culture 16(3)
normative institution controlling both the environment and the local people (Igoe
et al., 2009). These criticisms have emphasized that far from curbing corporate
efforts to increase economic growth and consumption and contrary to the desire to
increase environmental awareness, such cooperative ventures risk alienating envir-
onmentally committed donors.
On the other hand, corporate leaders risk being seen as too soft and forgetting
the ``bottom line'' (profit) in the eyes of their shareholders (Van Huijstee et al.,
2011; Van Huijstee and Glasbergen, 2010a, b).
Returning to the case of WWF and collaboration, WWF Global states that
it establishes partnerships with companies ``to help change the way business is
done'' (http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/how_we_work/businesses/). Business
Education, through WWF's One Planet Leaders program, is listed as one of such
partnership (http://www.oneplanetleaders.org/). We shall therefore address the
issue of how EE fits within the objectives of WWF before returning to the case
of Animal Cards.
EE
The focus of EE has been moving in many different directions, starting with conser-
vation education (e.g. Norris and Jacobson, 1998), education for deep ecology (e.g.
LaChapelle, 1991), and progressively moving toward the more socially focused edu-
cation for sustainable development (ESD) (e.g. Bonnett, 2003). While the earlier

Kopnina 935
forms of EE focused on negative human impact on the environment, arguing for the
need to recognize limits to growth and the need to curb the growth of human popu-
lation and consumption, the late 1980s have been characterized by the aim of bal-
ancing economic, social, and ecological concerns (Stevenson, 2006). This turn away
from concerns about environmental problems toward social inequality signifies a
change congruent with the dominant sustainable development rhetoric (Bonnett,
2013; Kopnina, 2012). While education for conservation, including outdoor and
experiential education, has remained part of EE repertoire (e.g. Sandell and
O
¨ hman, 2010), ESD has become an essential component of EE (Aarnio-
Linnanvuori, 2013).
Many NGOs saw their connection to EE and ESD as part of their strategy to
achieve environmental awareness (Blum, 2009). Part of WWF's objective is to
educate people about the need to live sustainably and address unsustainable con-
sumption. Where does this leave the Animal Cards?
Case study results
The reactions of both children and parents can be clustered into a number of
themes, based on cognitive (knowledge-related) and effective (emotional) reactions,
ranging from general appreciation or resentment of the promotion to nuanced
views on how they relate Animal Cards to issues associated with consumption,
sustainability, and concrete opinions about AH and WNF.
Children
Observation of the children's behavior is exemplified by the vignette provided at
the beginning of this article. Segment 1 illustrates the response of a 7-year-old girl
Zoe explaining her reasons for trading (Figure 2):
Segment 1.
Zoe: First, mum didn't want to go to Albert Heijn, but I asked whether we could go
for cards because my friends already had cards . . .
Researcher: But why did you want Animal Cards?
Zoe: They are beautiful! And you learn a lot about animals!
Researcher: What kind of things do you learn about animals?
Zoe: Oh lots of . . . that some animals are very quick . . . some can fly very far, others
spend winters at home . . . Birds and such are also animals. Oh yeah, many animals are
in danger . . . [hesitates, long pause]
Researcher: Endangered?
Zoe: Yeah, endangered! Mum read about it in the album!
Researcher: Does the album explain what animals are endangered?
Zoe: Yes! But I forgot . . .
Researcher: Does the album explain why they are endangered?
936 Journal of Consumer Culture 16(3)
Zoe: Oh because they are eaten and so . . . other animals eat them . . . [hesitates, looks
hopefully at the researcher for help, when the researcher does not respond, adds
brightly] But many animals can be saved, and we can help!
It must be noted that not all children participated in the card sharing or trading
activities nor did all the children show interest in the Animal Cards promotion. The
researcher has followed those children who were engaged with the cards, although
a few significant observations were made by children who were not engaged in such
activities. Those children who were not engaged in exchanges were observed to join
their parents and guardians and leave the school premises or to occupy areas of
the playground where the card trading was not taking place. While the
researcher mostly engaged in conversations with card trading children, two
extracts from conversation with the non-trading children are significant as
they exemplify the reasons why some children liked to trade or not to engage in
trading:
Segment 2.
Researcher (talking to two non-trading girls Carla and Mila, both aged 8): So, you
girls don't trade Animal Cards?
Carla: Naaa . . .

Mila: I got cards from last year! Mum says we have no place to put them . . .
Researcher (to Carla): Do you also have cards from last year?
Carla: Not really . . .
Mila: She doesn't like them!
Researcher (to Carla): Why not?
Carla: Ahhhh . . . I don't know . . .
Mila: Her parents don't buy them . . . don't get them for her . . .
Researcher (to Carla): Really? (to Mila): Can Carla answer herself? (Mila nods
reluctantly)
Carla: I don't know . . . Mum doesn't like them, I guess.
Researcher: What about yourself?
Carla: Ahhh . . . They are nice. But I don't really need them.
Mila: You can share mine!
Carla: You don't have any . . . new ones.
Mila: Well, last year they were more fun. I got a whole book of them!
Researcher (to both girls): So, what's the difference between this year's cards and last
year's?
Mila: There's a lot of . . . writing . . . on new ones . . . I just like the pictures! I like the
funny animals, and this year they write stuff about . . . I don't know . . . I guess they are
trying to teach us about animals . . .
Researcher: Who is ``they''?
Mila: Albert Heijn! If you buy stuff in the store they want you to learn about
animals . . . We are learning about animals at school too!
Segment 3.
Researcher (talking to a non-trading boy Hans aged 9): How come you are not trading?
Hans: Animal Cards are for babies . . .
Researcher: Why is that?
Hans: They like to collect stuff. I don't need these cards. I collect mini-bikes. My
father has a big collection too . . .
Researcher: So, you think only young children are interested in Animal Cards?
Hans: Naaa . . . It's just that I know all this stuff . . . About animals . . . Albert Heijn
makes those cards every year. We have books about animals at home . . .
Researcher: Do you like to learn about animals?
Hans: Sure! But I'd rather go to the zoo . . .
Researcher: Do you think it's a good idea that you get Animal Cards when you do
shopping?
Hans (stares, thinks for a while): I don't know . . . It's kinda weird that you get them
[cards] at the supermarket . . . I guess they want to have more . . . eh . . . people in the
store. They have more . . . things that they give away when you shop.

It seems from these two segments that the children do not perceive the link between
the cards and WNF, thinking that it is AH that produces them. The children are
aware of the fact that this is not the first year that the cards have been produced
and that there are more promotional activities that AH engages in. Although they
do perceive an educational value in ``learning about animals,'' they acknowledge
that they get their information elsewhere (at school or from books about animals
at home).
Parents
As illustrated by the vignette preceding the ``Introduction'' section, parents'
involvement with Animal Cards was through their children, but as one father
acknowledged it in the segment below, the children's association with Animal
Cards was also through the parents:
Segment 4.
Father of a 7-year-old son (F7S) (talking to the researcher): The funny thing is, we [me
and my wife] started this madness . . . Max, my son, would not let us do the shopping
without hanging on our arm, but we were the ones who started this
collection . . . Maybe if he was the one with the money, he would have gone to another
store . . .
Researcher: Why do you refer to the collection [of Animal Cards] as madness?
F7S: Ah (laughs) t's just this whole exchange out there (points to the trading
children, then pauses thoughtfully) . . . But I think it's actually a good idea, it
teaches them [the children] to cooperate, to share . . . Also it taught Max some
responsibility: we told him in the store [Albert Hein] that we are not going to
spend 10 euros on shopping any time he wanted more Animal Cards, and that he
had to figure out what we really needed to buy ­ and no ice-creams! ­ what we
really needed in the house . . . and if it added up to 10 euros or above ­ sure, he
could have the cards . . .
Researcher: So Max learned to be a more responsible shopper?
F7S: Yeah, and note what costs what, what deals there are, as well as think about
what is already in the fridge and what we still need.
Researcher: And what about the cards? What do you think, is this a good promotion?
F7S (sounds a bit hesitant): Yeah, well . . . I don't know what they are really
promoting . . .
Researcher: Albert Hein or WNF?
F7S: Was it WNF? I didn't know that . . . (looks through the cards his son has stuffed
in his pocket) . . . Aha, the panda! I guess they want to promote their cause . . .
Researcher: Do you think it's working . . . with kids?
F7S: Promoting cause with kids? I don't know . . . I think Max is too young for
it . . . But maybe this is meant as educational . . .
Kopnina 939
The intention of the promotion and cooperation between AH and WNF was
discussed by two mothers in Segment 5:
Segment 5.
Mother 1: I think Albert Hein's making some extra money on this! Everybody's
shopping for over 10 euros, just to get these cards . . . I also got them, because every-
body has them, but then I thought: what am I doing?
Mother 2: I don't think anybody really buys extra . . . You know, a year ago there were
these footballers cards, then there were the Sesame street toys, or Disney toys, there's
always something . . . It's not very transparent how this works, I think . . . I don't think
anybody always buys more to collect everything . . .
Mother 1: My son loved the football cards! He is still mad about the
players . . . I wonder whether FIFA [football organization] or whoever was also
participating? . . .
Mother 2: I guess so! I think they like stunts, partnering with some big
organizations . . . Albert Heijn is probably the biggest with these co-operations!
Mother 1: They are like H&M [chain retail store] working with famous designers!
Mother 2: I think these Animal Cards are different though, they have this big thing
with WNF . . .
Mother 1: Oh?
Mother 2: Yeah, you know, they work with stores to have more sustainable
products . . . (Turns to the researcher who until now was passively listening in) You
were just asking somebody about it, right?
Researcher: Yeah, I am curious about what this Animal Cards promotion is
about . . . So, how do they participate in making these sustainable products, Albert
Heijn and WNF?
Mother 2: I think when an NGO puts its logo on the product, like with Fair Trade,
both the farmers ­ or the environment ­ profit because the NGO controls how the
product is made . . .
Researcher: And with these Animal Cards?
Mother 2 (shrugs, turns to Mother 1): I don't know . . . Maybe they use part of the
proceeds to reinvest in some jungle-saving actions . . . Do you have an idea? (Mother 1
appears blank) I guess it's on their website . . .
Reflection: Linking literature to the case
The vignette and segments above illustrate some of the impressions of how children
and parents perceive Animal Cards as well as some larger issues connected to the
promotions, cooperation, environment, and consumption. Linking three strands of
the literature, we may reflect on the ideological tensions and management's co-
option of consumer concern, as discussed by Jose
´ e Johnston (2008) in the case of
940 Journal of Consumer Culture 16(3)
the Whole Foods Market. Organic produce is commonly distributed by trans-
continental and global commodity chains to disparate market niches, involving
unsustainable transportation, which is in direct contrast to the original aspirations
of the organics movement (Johnston et al., 2009). Consumers seek social trans-
formation within the constraints of neoliberal regulatory regimes, and corporate-
organic marketing constitutes a hybridized identity that interacts with political
opportunities (Johnston et al., 2009). This hybrid identity involves both consent
to consume and, in the very act of consumption, buying ``redemption'' from the
``sin of consumption'' (Zizek, 2010). Remarkably, the educational value of Animal
Cards seems to be disconnected from these acts of consumption. Consumption and
sustainability are not necessarily consciously linked to each other by either children
or their parents. While the parents perceived the continuity between their act of
shopping and children's satisfaction, the children perceived possession of certain
cards as a desired good and means of enhancing social contacts (through
exchange).
Shopping was directly related to the promotion, causing some resentment
as it was linked to financial pressures (having to spend 10 euros on shopping to
get the cards) or social pressures (children sometimes insisted on parents doing
shopping to get cards, or parents wanted to get cards themselves because others got
them, etc.). Sustainability was only mentioned in connection to the sponsor of the
Animal Cards, WNF, which was recognized by some parents as sustainability-
related.
Strategic cooperation between companies and ENGOs did not occupy the chil-
dren at their age. This cooperation did elicit some parental responses, particularly
rationalizing this cooperation in terms of mutual benefit. The parents were not
aware of the nature of this benefit and, as one reflected, felt that the results of this
cooperation were not made transparent. However, the cooperation was not further
disputed.
The literature about collaborations between NGOs and commercial organiza-
tions, including ``Green Alliances'' (Arts, 2002; Crane, 1998; Hartman and
Stafford, 1997; Shah, 2011) as well as that on shareholder activism (Gritten and
Mola-Yudego, 2010), indicates that such alliances can help to simultaneously
increase shareholders' loyalty to commercial companies and to increase main-
stream acceptance of the work of ENGOs, leading to mutual benefits. While it is
clear from this case that the partnership exemplifies a strategy for integrating cor-
porate environmental responsibilities with market goals, environmental values
transferred to the consumers in the process remain ambiguous. If we assume
that such alliances are an outgrowth of the ``Market-based Environmentalism''
which advocates making ecology attractive to businesses through market incentives
(Hartman and Stafford, 1997), the environmental awareness of the consumers
might not reach beyond the commercial interests such as shopping discounts.
The motives for AH/WNF and consumer alliances seem to be manipulated by
the market-based environmentalism.
Kopnina 941
The educational effects of Animal Cards, such as knowledge of animals and
trading skills, were appreciated by children and parents. However, the educational
value of linking animals to the availability of sustainable products in AH or the
purported intention of WWF to educate consumers about animals through the very
act of consumption remains open to doubt. Bryant and Goodman (2004) have
discussed how values like conservation are marketed, arguing that green consump-
tion is a form of narrative that stimulates even more consumption. Educators who
increasingly came to treat neoliberal education with suspicion (Jickling, 2005;
Stevenson, 2006) could see how these manipulative forms of sustainability inter-
twine with the work of ENGOs and the narratives of corporate sustainability.
Moreover, the literature about consumption as an essential part of education for
sustainability is limited (e.g. Kopnina, 2011a, 2011c, 2013a). This case demon-
strates the need to highlight consumption as one of the key areas of education
for sustainability.
Limitations of the case
Previous studies of the environmental attitudes of Dutch upper elementary school
children and their parents to consumption (Kopnina, 2011a, 2011c, 2013a) and
transportation (Kopnina, 2011b; Kopnina and Williams, 2012) have demonstrated
that the environmental attitudes are not always consistent across generational or
socio-economic boundaries. For example, it appeared that children from the well-
to-do families with parents who own at least one car exhibited more environmental
awareness than children from the lower social status families whose parents did not
have cars. While this supports the post-material values hypothesis that postulates
that the underprivileged groups cannot ``afford'' environmental care, the evidence
also showed that while the wealthier families were more aware, their consumption
patterns were far from sustainable.
This study focused on the rather homogeneous sample of predominantly ethnic
Dutch middle-class income families, providing generational comparison only.
Follow-up research could focus on a more stratified sample and involve children
and parents from different socio-economic backgrounds.
Conclusion
The relationship between NGOs and commercial companies is a developing one,
and we have much to learn about it, particularly from consumer culture and sus-
tainability perspectives. This case of Animal Cards and the literature involving
sustainability, consumption and strategic cooperation reveals the tension between
the effort to foster environmental protection on the one hand and to address con-
sumption on the other hand. Cross-sector partnerships have the potential to lead to
improvements in corporate social responsibility and environmental awareness
among consumers, for example, by making the children more aware of biodiversity.
However, negative trade-offs of the animal card promotion become apparent when
942 Journal of Consumer Culture 16(3)
consumption of all kinds of products in the supermarket is rewarded by the same
cards. As observed by some of the parents from the case study of Animal Cards,
this promotion has possibly stimulated increased consumption. Judging from this
case, the effort has not led to questioning the connection between one of the largest
threats to environmental sustainability ­ Western-style consumption ­ that may be
indirectly threatening the habitats of the animals portrayed on the Animal Cards.
While it might not have been the WWF's intention to link consumption to sus-
tainability, promoting Animal Cards through the very act of consumption and
placing Animal Cards within the larger educational strategy do seem ironic. This
case study also raises questions about effectiveness of such partnerships in terms of
sustainable development and thus strategic considerations for ENGOs with their
collaborative strategy.
