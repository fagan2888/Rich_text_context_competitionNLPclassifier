Charge Of The Right Brigade? Communities,
Coverage, And Care For The Uninsured
Local communities tend to find it easier to expand care than to extend
coverage.
by Lawrence D. Brown and Beth Stevens
ABSTRACT: The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Communities in Charge (CIC) program
funded projects in fourteen communities that aimed to expand health insurance coverage
and improve care for their uninsured residents. Our examination of seven program sites
suggests that despite solid community leadership and carefully crafted plans, political, eco-
nomic, and organizational obstacles precluded much expansion of coverage and con-
strained reforms. Redistribution of financial and organizational resources among both
mainstream and safety-net institutions in these communities was hard to achieve. CIC's re-
cord offers little evidence that communities are better equipped than are other sectors of
U.S. society to solve the problem of uninsurance. [Health Affairs 25 (2006): w150­w161

When can their glory fade?
O the wild charge they made!
All the world wonder'd...
--Alfred, Lord Tennyson, "The Charge of the Light
Brigade," 1854
Despite a strong economy, by the
late 1990s the number of Americans
without health coverage hovered
around forty million; federal and state pro-
posals for universal coverage had long since
collapsed; and reformers wondered whether
community forces might reignite progress by
crafting new programs for the uninsured.
Within three years (1998­2000), the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation's (RWJF's) Com-
munities in Charge (CIC) program, the
Kellogg Foundation's Community Voices pro-
gram, and the federal Community Access
Program (now known as the Healthy Com-
munities Access Program, or HCAP) came
into being, and several hundred million dol-
lars were invested to develop local models of
improved coverage and care for the unin-
sured. (HCAP alone has 158 sites and a 2003
congressional appropriation of $105 million.)1
This paper examines the CIC program,
which during 2000­2003 funded fourteen
communities that assembled coalitions of pro-
viders, public officials, business leaders, and
consumer groups, to design projects that ei-
ther devoted financial resources to supplying
new coverage or reconfigured their delivery
systems to improve access to care for the unin-
sured. By conducting case studies of seven of
the CIC sites (Portland, Oregon; Brooklyn,

New York; Jacksonville, Florida; Portland,
Maine; Birmingham, Alabama; Alameda
County, California; and Jackson, Mississippi),
we sought to learn what circumstances are
"right" for local leadership on behalf of the un-
insured and whether such conditions are likely
to be found in enough sites to support the con-
tention that putting communities in charge of
this mission makes good policy sense.
Theory and practice (notably, the national
health insurance systems of all Western na-
tions save the United States) suggest that uni-
versal coverage presupposes large pools, which
implies in turn that true (that is, smallish)
communities will rarely be up to the job. On
the other hand, health is famously a "commu-
nity affair" in the United States. The example
of Hillsborough County, Florida, which since
the early 1990s brought coverage to nearly
30,000 uninsured residents with the proceeds
from a half-cent increase in the sales tax,
shows that communities can at least make a
dent in the problem.2 Moreover, local innova-
tions that improve the delivery of medical care
may not only per se benefit the uninsured but
also liberate new resources with which to ex-
pand coverage. What happens, then, when
communities, aided and abetted by foundation
support, work to mobilize resources sufficient
to expand coverage or care for the uninsured?
To answer these questions, we interviewed
key stakeholders in person at each site twice
and supplemented our site visits with tele-
phone interviews and examination of docu-
ments. The mix of modest progress, stalemate,
and collapse that we found after four years of
tracking suggests, in brief, that even communi-
ty leaders who are deeply dedicated to ad-
dressing the problems of the uninsured face a
sharp uphill struggle. A few communities have
engineered small expansions of coverage or
care, but nothing in the concatenation of cir-
cumstances that supported this modest prog-
ress or in the general record of our seven sites
argues that U.S. communities have the capac-
ity to make much of a dent in the problems of
the uninsured.3
Institutions And Resources
Improving coverage and care for the unin-
sured is inescapably an exercise in redistribu-
tion from the haves to the have-nots. Institu-
tions, public or private, that command
resources must agree to shift some share of
them to medically disadvantaged individuals
or households (coverage) or organizations
(care). Whether the strategy envisions, for ex-
ample, shifting patients from tertiary hospitals
to community health centers (CHCs), spend-
ing tobacco settlement funds on covering the
uninsured instead of on immunization cam-
paigns, or increasing the sales tax to aid those
without coverage instead of improving the
transportation infrastructure, some local in-
stitutions and residents will--absent the infu-
sion of new resources from outside the com-
munity--gain while others lose.
That broader coverage entails redistribu-
tion is a truism--to be sure, money spent for
one purpose is not available for others--but in
political terms, this truth is not trivial. Funds
for coverage get (re)channeled, not along opti-
mal lines charted by analysts but, rather,
through dark thickets of political conflict that
must be mapped before they can be success-
fully navigated, and CIC illuminates the tra-
vails that attend alternative visions of redistri-
bution.
Institutions that do the redistributing are
of two general types: "mainstream" (govern-
ment agencies, business firms, community
hospitals, medical societies, and managed care
organizations, for example); and "safety net"
(entities that traditionally care for the disad-
vantaged--CHCs, public clinics, and public or
voluntary hospitals with a high volume of un-
insured or publicly insured patients). Re-
sources to be redistributed also come in two
broad categories: funds (new tax dollars and
private insurance premiums) and "organiza-
tion" (revised procedures, donated profes-
sional services, redeployed personnel, and ser-
vice innovations such as group-based patient
education). To be sure, changes in funding
tend to have organizational implications, and
vice versa, but these variables are distinct
enough for our analytical purposes.

These categories combine into four main
strategies. First, mainstream institutions may
commit new moneys (funds not previously
used for this purpose; Portland, Oregon, and
Brooklyn). Second, mainstream institutions
may reorganize their time and work for the in-
tended advantage of the uninsured. This strat-
egy entails a redistribution of professional en-
ergies that improves care largely in lieu of new
monies (Portland, Maine). (Time, of course, is
famously money, so these redistributed ser-
vices are arguably equivalent to new funds, but
the distinction is worth maintaining.) Third,
safety-net institutions may redistribute their
budgets in ways that extend coverage or care
for the uninsured. Redistribution in this case
generally shifts funds among institutions and
purposes within the safety net itself in hopes
of forging a better system (Birmingham and
Alameda County). Fourth, safety-net institu-
tions may reconfigure the division of labor
among themselves or redesign workflow
within their organizations, to provide better
care for the uninsured.4
Strategies And Strains
n Strategy I. Portland, Oregon. Portland's
CIC program is a public variation on our first
strategic theme: raising new "mainstream"
dollars to benefit the uninsured. In a setting
accustomed to regional (tri-county) thinking
and institution building for transportation,
recreation, and other "collective" goods, defin-
ing the uninsured as a regional issue had
strong a priori appeal in Portland. In liberal
Multnomah County, moreover, creation of a
taxing district that might emulate the accom-
plishment of Hillsborough County, Florida,
was not entirely beyond the political pale. Talk
of new taxes, however, soon ran afoul of an
economy so sour that Oregon laid doleful
claim to the nation's highest unemployment
rate by mid-2002. The declining tax revenues
that ensued meant, of course, that the state
and counties were hard pressed to maintain
current levels of public service; finding new
funds to cover thousands of uninsured resi-
dents looked quixotic. Moreover, the region's
counties displayed different political personal-
ities and distinct institutional approaches to
providing health services: Multnomah County
had a liberal and activist tradition and sizable
public health institutions, but Washington
County was essentially a middle-class suburb,
conservative and cautious about adding new
public services to such basics as schooling and
law enforcement. Clackamas County fell
somewhere in between.
By 2002, having agreed that political pros-
pects for a new taxing district for the unin-
sured were negligible, CIC planners floated a
regional "port authority" that might somehow
take existing resources in hand and reconfig-
ure them for the benefit of the uninsured. Ten-
sions over intentions aggravated jurisdictional
distrust: Was the "authority" mainly a means
by which activist Multnomah might redistrib-
ute funds from its two county "partners" to it-
self, home to many of the region's uninsured
citizens and its safety-net providers? Finding
little taste for anything so structurally impos-
ing, reformers instead proposed tri-county
"cooperative agreements" to address the prob-
lems of uninsurance. Jettisoning the authorita-
tive connotations of an "authority," leaders in
the public health agencies in the three counties
quietly worked to convince their skeptical and
mostly detached "electeds" (county commis-
sioners) of the merits of a safety-net "enter-
prise," a term meant to suggest, said one
source, a business venture--an "organization
of influence."
In early 2004, nearing agreement in all
three counties on language that would bring
such an entity into being, the principals were
trying to decide what exactly it might do. High
on most lists were (1) the use of data to paint a
detailed picture of the distribution of care for
the uninsured among institutions in the coun-
ties, (2) concerting plans to leverage new fed-
eral dollars, (3) coordinating grant seeking
among safety-net clinics and hospitals, (4)
identifying ways to make care for the unin-
sured more equitable and efficient, and (of
course) (5) reducing inappropriate use of
emergency departments (EDs). Even these
seemingly innocuous projects could threaten
the autonomy of county leaders, however, so

promoters of the enterprise weighed their
words carefully. In fall 2003, said one, "It's just
talk of funneling resources through this
`thing'." Portland's mainstream institutions
had, in effect, exchanged strategy I, raising
new funds, for strategy IV, reorganizing the
safety net under the guiding hand of the
emerging "enterprise." But whether or not CIC
could produce something substantial re-
mained to be seen.
Brooklyn, New York. CIC in Brooklyn ran a
private variation on strategy I. Here new funds
to cover the uninsured are expected to come
from the private sector (small employers), not
from taxpayers. The Brooklyn project
breathed new life into an old idea: If the U.S.
private sector contrives to cover most employ-
ees, rocket science should not be needed to de-
vise appealing, affordable private insurance
products to cover the rest. To be sure, previous
efforts to develop such options have amounted
to a party to which small firms rarely choose to
come, but hope springs eternal, and Brooklyn
tweaked the core elements of small-employer
insurance in promising ways.5
Specifically, Brooklyn's CIC plan--Brook-
lyn Health Works (BHW)--combined strong
public support by the borough president, en-
thusiastic endorsement by the local Chamber
of Commerce, and the prospect of state waiv-
ers that would exempt the new coverage from
taxes imposed on most carriers. The plan mo-
bilized an impressive cast of participants. The
Group Health Insurance plan, which had
much experience in the small-group market,
agreed to underwrite the coverage. The Cham-
ber of Commerce helped brokers identify eligi-
ble firms. The borough's hospitals, which
hoped that new paying customers would
brighten their fiscal picture, agreed to accept
deep discounts. The office of the borough pres-
ident could engage community organizations,
which conferred the legitimacy of citizen par-
ticipation on the plan. If, as one CIC planner
proclaimed, "it's all about relationships," the
project seemed to have lined up its ducks ad-
mirably. The need, moreover, was unquestion-
able: Brooklyn housed few private providers,
plentiful poor and uninsured residents, and a
growing number of immigrants who could not
otherwise qualify for coverage.
Forces in the environment of the program
soon shook these well-laid plans. An economic
downturn, severely aggravated by the impact
of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, fur-
ther stressed the precarious profit margins of
small firms in Brooklyn. The borough presi-
dency changed hands, and the new incumbent
viewed this complex project from the previous
regime with understandable caution. Provid-
ers sought formal assurance that the new plan
would not enroll people holding less deeply
discounted insurance, but state law precluded
such "anti-crowd-out" provisions.
In 2002­2003 the economy gradually began
to revive; the Chamber of Commerce assumed
leadership of the project, supplying energy for-
merly emanating from the borough president's
office; and discussions between project staff
and the state's superintendent of insurance
yielded an ingenious solution to the crowd-out
problem: putting BHW under the program-
matic umbrella of Healthy New York, a state
program that helped small firms gain health
coverage. This move bought BHW both the
protections its providers wanted and valuable
stop-loss protection. The key, remarked a par-
ticipant, was to "leverage public spirit" by
"aligning the interests of the uninsured with
those of other entities." CIC wanted the state
Department of Insurance to help make its
product acceptable to providers and affordable
to purchasers; the state government wanted a
shot in the arm for the lagging enrollment of
Healthy New York.
Bringing the state on board was a crucial
breakthrough, yet there was no rest for CIC's
weary planners. As they prepared to cut the
ribbon on BHW, the health system that ran a
hospital key to the plan's network forbade the
institution to accept the discounted rates, and
the tense negotiations that followed delayed
the plan's unveiling for six months. The prod-
uct finally hit the market in early 2004 but, af-
ter seven months of enrollment, had signed up
only fifty-five employees in eighteen firms.

I (increased funding, which is a heavy lift) and
the more tractable strategy II (reorganization
of the delivery of care). Initially, CIC hoped to
emulate Hillsborough County's success by
winning an increase of a half-cent on the
county sales tax to cover the uninsured. This
hope evaporated when the mayor opted in-
stead to use the increase for his "Better Jack-
sonville" initiative, which featured a range of
civic improvements. CIC's Plan B--some com-
bination of public and private revenues with
which to expand coverage--held little prom-
ise. Local government already pumped sizable
sums into the local safety-net hospital, to cover
the costs of caring for the medically indigent,
and was disinclined to commit further funds
to a new program. Moreover, chief executives
of the city's other major hospitals were unwill-
ing to cough up new monies of their own.
In Jacksonville, however, CIC staff found
strategic assets that were absent from Port-
land, Oregon. The site's consolidated city-
county government averted intergovernmen-
tal battles, and a thriving economy both ele-
vated health coverage on the agenda of private
employers who wanted to attract good work-
ers and spared the city from the ravaged reve-
nues that constrained policy innovations in
many local venues.
Through 2002, CIC staff, aided by an influ-
ential local foundation, convened a string of
forums in which the components of the unin-
surance problem in Jacksonville were exam-
ined and options to address it were carefully
canvassed. The influential chief executive of
the city's largest hospital, eager both to reduce
of the burden of the uninsured on his hospital
and to advance its religious mission, embraced
the project and tirelessly urged both the mayor
and other hospital leaders to attend the forums
and stay the course. Gradually, consensus set-
tled on a public-private partnership, and the
protagonists worked to whittle one into shape.
The resulting model, JaxCare, is a reorganized
delivery system in which an expanded net-
work of providers (safety-net and mainstream
hospitals), offering a specified set of benefits,
discounted prices, and improved information
technology and promoted in the marketplace
by a cooperative Chamber of Commerce, will
provide efficient care for the newly insured. As
endorsed by the mayor and the city council,
JaxCare will use $2.5 million of new public
funds (supplemented by hospital contribu-
tions and management assistance from Blue
Cross Blue Shield of Florida) to pilot a pro-
gram that brings new coverage to 1,500 work-
ing uninsured Jacksonville residents. JaxCare's
sponsors expect that evaluators will find im-
proved health outcomes coupled with less rap-
idly rising costs of care once ED use declines
and primary care case management takes hold.
A positive verdict, they hope, might persuade
local, state, federal, foundation, and private
funders to sustain and expand the program.
Strategies I and II were thus conjoined. The
prospect of efficiency generated by the reorga-
nization of the safety net would entice contri-
butions of new money from government and
providers and then, as the system evolved,
gradually replace (at least partially) those city
and hospital funds with savings generated by
more effective use of resources. In August
2004, however, demonstrated savings were the
least of the project's worries: JaxCare had only
seventy enrollees and was pondering how to
find its market niche.
n Strategy II. Portland, Maine. In Portland,
mainstream institutions created a plan, Care-
Partners, that reorganized the delivery system
to expand care for the uninsured. The partners
included MaineHealth (an integrated non-
profit hospital system that served three-
fourths of the state's population), affiliated
hospitals in three counties, Anthem Blue Cross
(which supplied claims management at no
cost), and more than 700 primary care and spe-
cialty practices. Providers delivered uncom-
pensated care to a limited number of unin-
sured patients via primary care "medical
homes," office-based specialty care, and hospi-
talization when needed. MaineHealth com-
mitted funds for prescription drugs. Eligible
patients were enrolled in disease management
programs, and care managers would generate
savings on hospital and ED use that were ex-
pected partially to offset the program's cost.
Implementation of the model revealed the

complexities of even small-scale system reor-
ganization. One county, Waterville-Augusta,
enjoyed reasonable levels of provider partici-
pation and enrollment of beneficiaries. A sec-
ond, Portland, found good participation
among primary care physicians and hospitals
but surprisingly sluggish enrollment. In the
third, rural Lincoln County, providers were
few and feared the costs of serving a (presum-
ably) rising number of uninsured patients,
who were (these fears notwithstanding) nota-
bly slow to enroll.
Three challenges, more-
over, cut across all three set-
tings. First, physicians were
ambivalent about participat-
ing. A mix of motives induced
hospitals to join CarePart-
ners: namely, mission (all hos-
pitals in Maine save one are
voluntary nonprofits and by
state law must care for the
medically indigent), margin
(readier primary care and case management
for the uninsured should lower the costs of un-
compensated ED services), and Medicaid (a
source of revenue for which some CarePart-
ners enrollees would prove to be eligible). Phy-
sicians were a tougher sell. In a state with few
CHCs, many physicians already quietly gave
primary care to the uninsured, but some were
said to fear that signing up with CarePartners
would make them a magnet for more than they
could handle. Specialists were especially slow
to commit to the program. That physicians
tended to be widely dispersed across rural
populations further complicated the plan's ef-
forts to recruit them. On the other hand, pri-
mary care physicians were pleased that Care-
Partners would supply or improve such tools
as diagnostic services and medications, which
their uninsured patients needed but were of-
ten obliged to forgo.
Second, as in such undersubscribed pro-
grams as Medicaid and the State Children's
Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), those
who were eligible had to learn about Care-
Partners and how to enroll. This process began
with proof that they did not qualify for Medic-
aid, a time-consuming and stigmatizing deter-
mination that some uninsured people declined
to pursue. The number of uninsured people
who sought to sign on was also unimpressive
because, as one respondent observed, many of
them "were satisfied with episodic care." Ag-
gressive outreach by the plan might have
boosted the ranks of enrollees, but constraints
on the number it could support held its zeal to
recruit in check.
The size of the coverage gap that the Maine
CIC project sought to plug
changed before its eyes, more-
over, as its objectives were
discombobulated by the
shifts in public eligibility cri-
teria that go with the terri-
tory of incremental gap-fill-
ing programs. When state
expansions in Medicaid cov-
erage (unexpected in light of
Maine's budget woes) took
away hard-won CarePartners
enrollees, the plan had to revisit its own stan-
dards for eligibility, and CIC planners debated
whether to cast their net more widely, perhaps
offering CarePartners to workers who stayed
uninsured because they could not afford to
take up their employer's offer of coverage. That
course risked crowding out private coverage,
however, which no one wanted to do. Late in
2003, CIC tentatively agreed to open Care-
Partners to workers who could not afford the
coverage offered by their employer, but only if
the workers' premiums, deductibles, and
copays would exceed 5 percent of their ad-
justed gross income. As a price of compromise,
providers (mainly the rural hospitals) insisted
on enrollment caps in each site, lest they be
flooded by new enrollees.
The disinclination of providers and pa-
tients to change their behavior presented a
third challenge. In theory, by improving the
use of resources, care management would yield
savings with which to expand CarePartners.
But physicians, voluntarily rendering uncom-
pensated care, were reluctant to complete the
paperwork that generated the data on which
sound coordination of care depends. More-

over, erratic participation of patients in the
program (doubtless born partly of comfort
with fragmented care and partly of shifting eli-
gibility rules) further diluted the promise of
coordination and care management.
By the end of 2003, Maine's CIC project was
treading water. A state plan to expand cover-
age would yet again redefine the gap Care-
Partners aimed to fill. Pharmacy costs had
risen to 40 percent of the plan's budget and
threatened to drain the coffers of its main
sponsor, thus clouding the program's financial
future. Disease management was just getting
off the ground. "We just wanted to do our
share," one of the project's prime movers re-
flected. "We never claimed to be solving the
problem of the uninsured here in Maine."
n Strategy III. Birmingham, Alabama. In two
sites, safety-net institutions tried to engineer a
sizable redistribution of dollars within their
systems. In Birmingham the core of the safety
net is Cooper-Green Hospital, a county entity
of 1970s vintage, built largely to ensure care for
African Americans who had been made to feel
unwelcome in "community" hospitals during
years of segregation. Cooper-Green, to which
the county devotes about $40 million annually,
came increasingly under attack as an obsolete
facility that rendered care of questionable
quality. Birmingham's other hospitals, with
plenty of unused capacity, contended that they
could provide inpatient care for African Amer-
icans; that bitter memories of segregation had
(or should have) faded; and that what Cooper-
Green's patients needed above all was accessi-
ble, high-quality primary care. CIC planners
therefore hoped to forge agreement that the
county's annual outlay would shift from Coo-
per-Green to the building of "network service
areas" among community hospitals and clinics,
and an expanded primary care system cospon-
sored by the County Health Department and a
much-downsized Cooper-Green.
This win-win scenario proved to be a polit-
ical loser. Cooper-Green was, rightly or
wrongly, a potent symbol of racial equality,
and although its defenders no longer feared
that black women would give birth on the
lawns of "white" hospitals that refused to ad-
mit them or would be consigned to substan-
dard segregated basement wards, they were by
no means convinced that these mainstream in-
stitutions would welcome blacks, treat them
with dignity, and give them good care. More-
over, the county commissioners who oversaw
Cooper-Green were reluctant both to lose the
$40 million of county funds that bought jobs
for their constituents and to divert funds to in-
stitutions outside their control that might re-
turn repeatedly to demand more money as the
price of caring for the uninsured. Acrimony be-
tween Cooper-Green's defenders (mainly
black) and proponents of new arrangements
predicated on primary care (mainly white)
grew steadily, yielding a nasty public fight that
the primary care forces lost. Unable to reas-
semble Humpty Dumpty, Birmingham's CIC
program shut down late in 2002. The lesson
seems to be that although the safety net has
sizable resources to "play" with, the status
quo's many defenders can play hardball poli-
tics that sharply limits the fungibility of those
resources.
AlamedaCounty,California. Alameda County's
CIC program delivers a similar message by a
different route. Building on a provision of Cali-
fornia law that guarantees MediCal (Califor-
nia Medicaid) beneficiaries the choice of a
safety net­sponsored managed care organiza-
tion (MCO), the county created Alameda Alli-
ance for Health, a nonprofit MCO built on the
area's abundant CHCs. The plan proved to be a
financial success, and the county's hospital,
CHCs, community activists, and government
officials, collaborating as the CIC grantee, de-
bated how to invest the Alliance's reserves.
"The community would have squawked if we
didn't use those reserves for the community
good," one stakeholder explained.
Community leaders in the CIC collabora-
tive agreed that both expanding health cover-
age and strengthening the safety net were un-
impeachable priorities, but they differed on
how to strike a balance between the two. One
school maintained that the county's heavy
spending on the safety net ought to be redis-
tributed toward insurance coverage. A propo-
nent of this strategy conjectured that

when the gap gets small enough between money
for the uninsured and what you spend on safety-
net institutions, maybe you can take some of the
money now targeted on providers and go to in-
surance. Yeah, they [the safety net] will scream
bloody murder, but if you've got $60­$70 million
annually in the safety net, can't you convert some
of it? But public hospitals in California think
bigger is better. The public hospital lobby is part
of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, and
they're powerful, so you're fighting the people
who support you the most. They want to build
big institutions--jobs and political support are
there. Then besides the county hospitals, you've
got the community-based clinics, the county
workers, and the minority doctors with forty-to-
fifty-year traditions, who say, "We do 70 percent
of the care for moms and kids, so why are we be-
ing left out?" Add it up, and the safety net is big.
For advocates of insurance, CIC was a win-
dow of opportunity. Its funds would supply
the staff, data, expertise, and managerial ca-
pacity both to help boost enrollment in Medi-
Cal and to design and market new coverage,
"Family Care"--subsidized by $14 million
from the Alliance's reserves (plus $1 million
per year from state tobacco settlement funds
and $400,000 from the California Endow-
ment). CIC constituted new resources that
could broaden the insurance beachhead with-
out "messing with existing money for the
safety net," as one player put it.
Although defenders of the safety net duti-
fully acknowledged that coverage and care
were not zero-sum alternatives, the new
prominence that CIC conferred on the former
threatened the latter. One participant re-
marked on the community's "consensus that
we don't want hospitals to go under or close
beds. To shrink the hospitals conflicts with
the community's preference for choice." Not
too much choice, however: Insurance that per-
mitted subscribers to get care from providers
beyond the safety net cruelly rebuffed those
who dutifully treated the uninsured when oth-
ers declined to do so. One CHC executive
thought it "irresponsible just to give them in-
surance and let them go where they please.
You've got to nourish the safety-net infrastruc-
ture, too." A public hospital executive joined
the chorus:
Even if everyone is insured, they still [have to]
get care somewhere, and a lot of the private pro-
viders just don't want these folks. And for the
safety net, it's not just health care--it's social
work, nutrition, and lots more. The safety net
will do these things; the private providers just
don't and won't.
As Family Care rolled out, state and county
budget surpluses began to vanish into omi-
nous deficits, and stressed hospitals in the
county laid moral claim to a portion of the Al-
liance's reserves, thus challenging the ascen-
dance of the new insurance strategy. In a con-
tentious and wrenching session, the Alliance's
directors voted to bail out the hospitals with
$12 million of Alliance reserves. When the
county's medical center successfully de-
manded another $7 million to keep operating,
observers wondered whether redistribution of
safety-net resources to insurance coverage had
found its legs politically and whether care and
coverage could reverse their customary roles at
the center and periphery of the system.
Events in 2003 brought disconcerting clar-
ity. Tackling a huge budget deficit, the state
deferred implementation of a federally ap-
proved waiver that would have brought new
coverage to parents of SCHIP-eligible chil-
dren--coverage on which Family Care had
been counting as it estimated the number of
lives it could afford to cover. As its own costs
rose and its MediCal rates faced contraction,
the Alliance insisted that its reserves (no lon-
ger readily replenishable) should not be ex-
pected to carry Family Care forward. By year's
end, CIC's leaders were scrambling to assem-
ble from California foundations, county to-
bacco settlement sums, and other coffers re-
sources sufficient to sustain coverage for 3,200
lives, about half of its peak enrollment. By mid-
2004, no more than 2,000 covered lives seemed
sustainable. Meanwhile, a $78 million deficit
in the Alameda County Medical Center, the
core of the safety net, left no doubt that the
county's statutory duties to sustain care ines-
capably dwarfed its good intentions to expand
coverage.

formed the Hinds County Health Alliance
(HCHA), which sought to expand care for un-
insured patients by improving the flow of care.
Although increasing Medicaid enrollment and
exploring the design of a new insurance prod-
uct were part of the agenda, the centerpiece
was a plan to shift nonurgent ED use to less
expensive and more clinically appropriate pri-
mary care services rendered at neighborhood
clinics and a convenient health complex called
the Medical Mall. The four major voluntary
hospitals in Jackson set aside
their rivalries to gather data
on use patterns and fashion
new referral services among
the hospitals, the CHCs, and
the Medical Mall. Although
the project's staff hoped that
the four key hospitals might
commit $50,000 apiece to
these plans (making Jackson
also an exemplar of Strategy
II), funding mainly entailed "coordination of
existing resources," which, a participant ex-
plained, made sound political sense: "It's key to
maximize the system you've got, or people
won't listen when you ask for more money."
Jackson's CIC staff hoped to reduce frag-
mentation of care by creating a sophisticated
program in which volunteer hospital employ-
ees referred patients who used EDs inappro-
priately to one of the HCHA's primary care
centers. The HCHA proposed to increase the
access of patients to primary care providers by
means of such extra services as transportation
to clinics, a mobile phone system (to reduce
broken appointments), a discount prescrip-
tion drug program, and disease management
(mainly for diabetics and cardiac patients).
This model of increased coordination within
the safety net and between safety-net provid-
ers and their patients seemed so promising
that in early 2003 the Mississippi State Divi-
sion of Medicaid contracted with the Alliance
to channel Medicaid patients to primary care
settings.
The strategy fell short, however. Fearful
that the HCHA might be a bill collector or
welfare office, almost half of the ED patients
gave incorrect addresses or phone numbers,
leaving project staff unable to contact them
about primary care referrals. Reorganization
of care, moreover, failed to penetrate far
enough throughout the safety net. Uninsured
patients trying out CHCs and the Medical
Mall found four-week waits for appointments
and long delays in waiting rooms once they
reached their primary care medical "homes."
Meanwhile, competition had spurred the four
hospitals to reengineer their EDs, which re-
duced average waiting times
to an hour. Faced with pri-
mary care alternatives that
kept them waiting longer and
collected mandatory copay-
ments on the spot, many of
the uninsured stuck with the
ED, leaving the future of the
Jackson project in doubt.
Assessments And
Insights
The basic strategic tools for improving
health coverage and care for the uninsured--
more public or private money (or both), reallo-
cation of funds within the safety net, and
better organization of care within the safety
net or the larger community system--are
available to any community that cares to de-
ploy them. Although CIC is now winding
down, many communities across the country
have tried to adopt one or more of these strate-
gies. CIC's checkered career offers a useful,
though limited, commentary on the pros and
cons of such community-centered initiatives.
A streamlined structure/process/outcome
assessment of the seven CIC sites studied here
goes like this: Highly intelligent and mission-
driven local leaders carefully planned and he-
roically pursued initiatives that yielded mod-
est results. The program's fondest hope--that
the funded sites would follow Hillsborough
County's lead by raising new "mainstream"
funds for covering the uninsured--was largely
disappointed in the few sites (notably Ore-
gon's three counties, Brooklyn, and Jackson-
ville) that sought to realize it. In this "cell,"
power too widely diffused over too many inde-

pendent institutions bedevils the most com-
mitted and energetic local leaders. Redistrib-
uting funds within the safety net for new
coverage (Alameda County) or patterns of care
(Birmingham) fares little better. Funding pat-
terns in safety-net institutions that might
strike critics as inefficient and ripe for revision
look to insiders like admirable (albeit misun-
derstood) embodiments of their vital roles and
mission.
The CIC program in southern Maine shows
notable, although limited, success in organiz-
ing new care for the uninsured by enlisting an
expanding cadre of mainstream providers.
One lesson might be that "more is better" re-
mains the most feasible formula for redistribu-
tion in the U.S. health care system, but getting
that "more" was not easy. And the main lesson
of CIC's redesign of caregiving within Jack-
son's safety net is all too familiar: Changing the
behavior of complex formal organizations is
difficult, and changing the care-seeking pref-
erences and patterns of disadvantaged con-
sumers is no easier.
n Coverage versus care. Contemplation
of the four strategies yields a cross-cutting in-
sight: Communities tend to find it "easier"
(though not easy) to expand care than to ex-
tend coverage. Organizational politics within
and among community health care institu-
tions that aim to redesign care encounter
fewer (though not few) pitfalls than do tax
and budgetary politics among elected officials
and public agencies that hope to generate new
coverage. The institutions that deliver care to
community residents without coverage are up
close and personal. Uninsured people morph
into "patients" in waiting rooms and EDs. Care
really is a "community affair," whereas the in-
stitutions that govern coverage lie here, there,
and everywhere--a "field of inaccountabili-
ties."6 That the coverage buck so often starts
and stops elsewhere is of course one reason
why communities are compelled to pump siz-
able sums of their own money into safety-net
institutions.
Moreover, power comes more readily to
hand in reforms of care than in those that ex-
tend coverage. Local providers and payers in
Maine, for instance, controlled enough levers
to implement the agreements they negotiated
among themselves to donate services. The new
information system that Jacksonville con-
vinced its hospitals to accept speaks to a func-
tion these hospitals control. Care-improving
innovations may nonetheless carry costs both
economic and political--disputes between
"old" safety-net entities and "new" ones like
CHCs, for example. Nor are such innovations
guaranteed immunity from costs imposed
from above the community--for instance, hos-
pitals that reduce the number of uninsured
people treated in their EDs may jeopardize
their federal disproportionate-share hospital
(DSH) payments. On balance, however, it is
probably fair to generalize that persuading
mainstream providers to donate services to a
new plan (Maine) is less arduous than recon-
figuring operations within existing safety-net
institutions (Jackson), which is in turn less
torturous than shifting millions of dollars
within safety-net institutions and between
these and mainstream ones (Birmingham)--
which still might face slightly rosier prospects
than raising local taxes for new coverage for
the uninsured or inducing small firms to buy
it.
n Where the power lies. Even when art-
fully amassed, local power might not suffice to
secure local coverage projects. New models of
coverage require certification by state insur-
ance authorities. BHW could not hit the mar-
ket until insurance authorities (belatedly)
eased its way. The launching of JaxCare was
much delayed first by long debates over
whether the plans constituted "insurance" and
then by honoring the demands of state insur-
ance regulators. And as California's decision
not to implement a crucial coverage-expand-
ing federal waiver reminded CIC staff in
Alameda County, local plans may depend
heavily on state and federal powers of the
purse. Such variables as state criteria for eligi-
bility in Medicaid and SCHIP, private employ-
ers' willingness to offer health insurance to
their workers, and the vagaries of regional
economies powerfully influence the number of
uninsured, but communities can do little

about them. The raw materials of universal
coverage--Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP, man-
dated employer purchases, and monies forgone
by tax expenditure polices--lie outside com-
munity hands.7
Improvements in the delivery of care also
furnish a more fruitful arena for the exertion of
mission-driven local leaders than expansions
do. Cases in point are Maine, where CIC aug-
mented donated care, and Jackson, where lead-
ers of a quartet of hospitals were determined
to show that their image of better-organized
safety-net services could work. CIC protago-
nists in Portland, Oregon; Brooklyn; and
Alameda County were no less dedicated to
their plans for the creation of new coverage,
but following the money they needed was one
thing, securing it quite another.
n Levels-of-government question. On all
three counts, then--institutions, power, and
leadership--reconfigurations of care tend to
lie more firmly within the purview of commu-
nity control than do coverage expansions. It
would be hasty to infer that this good news
about care offsets the bad news about cover-
age, however: In most communities the need to
maintain (never mind enhance) the local
safety-net establishment retains first claim on
community resources and consigns redistribu-
tion of safety-net resources and organizational
patterns to the outer margins of the system. As
long as they contain more or less functioning
safety nets, community leaders seldom show
much taste for pitched battles over their re-
configuration and instead rest content to keep
them (more or less) intact, preferably with as
much federal and state money as may be lever-
aged, leaving safety-net providers to fight
among themselves over the (re)distribution of
labor and largesse.
Notwithstanding a couple of medium-
wattage points of light, CIC offers little hope
that communities can or will make major
breakthroughs in expanding coverage or care
for the uninsured. To infer that communities
are therefore the wrong answer to what is es-
sentially a question of the proper division of la-
bor within the U.S. federal system would be
misleading, however. Although Hillsborough-
like programs are rare, communities invest
large sums in care for the uninsured. How
much coverage those funds might buy were
they redistributed from safety-net institutions
is largely a moot point, because, first, such re-
programming is not in the political and institu-
tional cards and, second, the need for accessible
care for the (newly) insured would demand
some retention or reinvention of current safety-
net capacity.
The states, too, present a blurred picture of
inhibition at war with innovation. Medicaid is
the first or second most costly item of spend-
ing in most state budgets and is crucial for lo-
cal safety-net providers. Medicaid now spends
far more than most states would prefer to
commit to health coverage, but Hawaii has had
an employer mandate since 1974, California
keeps flirting with a mandate, Massachusetts
and Washington enacted laws that (had polit-
ical tides not shifted dramatically) would have
approached universal coverage, and Minne-
sota has adopted public programs that com-
bine with its broad private coverage to drive
its percentage of uninsured residents below 10
percent.
The federal government, which has the
greatest capacity of the three government lev-
els to raise funds and pool insured lives, has
conspicuously failed to achieve universal cov-
erage. The feds, however, spend handsomely
on Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP and subsi-
dize the safety net in many ways. Across the
intergovernmental system, then, runs a com-
mon theme: All three levels are financially pre-
occupied with their existing duties for cover-
age and care and have been able neither to
build the political consensus nor to find the
political will to get forty-six million more
Americans covered and served. If identifying
the right level of government for the job were
the central challenge, the nation would be
lucky indeed.
n Cultural and political question. The
levels-of-government question is secondary to
a primary cultural and political question: Why
does the United States, unique among West-
ern peers, persist in permitting so many citi-
zens to go un- and underinsured? A short list

of answers would doubtless include the na-
tion's tenacious clinging to the sacrosanct pic-
ture of a private-sector, market-centered, em-
ployment-based system that confers health
coverage as a fringe benefit; the proposition
that government's rightful role is to fill gaps in
private arrangements; chronic fear of "too
much government," regularly inflamed by
demagoguery about alleged "rationing" and
"federal government takeovers"; the insistence
of all major interest groups that reform is nec-
essary but acceptable only if its costs fall on
any group but one's own; the comforting con-
viction among the public that those without
coverage can and do get adequate care in the
safety net; and a distinctly American social
construction of citizenship that does not rec-
ognize the moral claims of solidarity and hence
does not legitimize the redistribution and
cross-subsidies that universal coverage re-
quires. Simply to scan this list is to see how
and why the concrete contributions of a pro-
gram like CIC cannot be more than marginal.
But insofar as the program helped immerse lo-
cal notables in the intricacies and trade-offs
that perplex health policy and stiffened their
resolve to work them through politically, its
structures and processes might eventually
promote outcomes more impressive than CIC
could achieve on its own time and turf.

3. The only major new local programs for the unin-
sured have developed in several California coun-
ties in the past two years. Aiming to supply cov-
erage to uninsured children ages 0­5, these pro-
grams are funded by a state tax on the use of to-
bacco and are supplemented by philanthropic
grants.
4. Although the analysis of the strategies in this pa-
per concentrates on the major program elements
of the seven sites, these elements do not exhaust
the sites' CIC-sponsored activities. For example,
under strategy I, the federal Health Resources
and Services Administration (HRSA) gave
Brooklyn an HCAP grant for drug coverage, and
in AlamedaCounty, two foundationsgaveFamily
Care a total of $1.85 million--a small but not un-
important addition to the $14 million with
which the Alliance capitalized the plan. In strat-
egy II, Jacksonville providers donated care to
help keep JaxCare affordable, and in Brooklyn,
both public and private hospitals agreed to ac-
cept discounted fees (which can be treated as be-
ing equivalent to donated time). Strategy III con-
tains the donation by Jacksonville's safety-net
hospital of $400,000 and of certain tertiary ser-
vices to JaxCare. Examples of strategy IV include
Alameda County's "frequent user" program,
which aims to bring counseling and other social
services to exceptionally high users of ED care.
CIC can properly claim credit for these (and
other) initiatives, but their importance is decid-
edly secondary to those discussed in the text.

7. Not the least important contribution of CIC and
kindred community interventions to expanded
coverage is to identify residents who are eligi-
ble for Medicaid, SCHIP, and other public pro-
grams and speed them on their way to enroll-
ment. A case in point is Alameda County's No
Wrong Door program, in which CIC, working
with new leadership in the county's social ser-
vices agency, encouraged a newly "proactive" ap-
proach to matching eligible people with public
coverage.
