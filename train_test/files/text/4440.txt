Introduction
Since the early 1990s the concept of sustainability has underpinned urban development
policies and programmes in cities worldwide. It is used by the United Nations (UN),
amongst others, to promote `good governance', `participatory development', and
`environmental stewardship', and it explicitly draws on, and institutionalises, Third
Way principles of governance. These, as Swyngedouw (2009) notes,
``reconfigure the act of governing to a stakeholder-based arrangement of governance
in which the traditional state forms (national, regional, and local government)
partake together with experts, non-governmental organisations and other responsible
partners'' (page 608).
For a growing group of postpolitical writers sustainability programmes thus
become vehicles for the replacement of the adversarial class politics of the postwar
period with a new politics, founded on consensus building, collaboration, and a non-
ideological neopragmatism (see Beck and Sznaider, 2006; Giddens, 2009). They provide
a foundation for a politics of inclusion founded on the identification of `collective'
interests and agendas that go beyond narrowly defined class interests. Such politics,
it is argued, recharacterises politics as a technical, project-focused activity, beyond
conflict. It assumes that policy interventions can be made that benefit all.
Whilst such debates over politics, the political, and sustainability provide explana-
tions of change at a more abstract level, they also open up a number of more empirical
questions over the geographical diversity of political systems and the role of different
forms of agency, context, and path dependency in the development of contemporary
policy programmes. We know relatively little, for example, about who the agents of
Third Way postpolitical agendas are in different cities and countries and from where
their understandings and interpretations of terms such as consensus politics and

Abstract. The concept of sustainability has been used by city governments worldwide to promote
urban development. For some the term represents an archetypal postpolitical construct that enables urban
populations and policy makers to confront collective problems in a consensus-driven way. In short,
it enables a new conflict-free politics to emerge within cities. This paper uses the example of Taipei,
Taiwan to explore how sustainable development agendas in a postcolonial city, which has a relatively
young democratic system, are articulated and with what effects. It examines the utility of recent
postpolitical writing as an explanatory frame for contemporary political changes. It documents how
and in what ways postpolitical agendas have been established and how they have been used to nullify
conflict by shifting attention away from grassroots concerns over globally oriented developmentalism.

sustainability are taken from. Writers on the `postpolitical condition' (cf Rancie
© re, 2006)
often draw on abstract conclusions about the class-based nature of adversarial politics
and engage in a limited way with questions of diversity, or what Ong (2007) terms the
policy `crystallisations' that form through global and local interactions and boundary
crossings across the world. These geographies of postpoliticism often remain implicit
leaving critical writing on the governance of sustainability open to charges of top-down
political ^ economic determinism. Writing is often founded on a Eurocentrism that
seeks to generate universal theories from the postwar experiences of a relatively small,
albeit powerful, group of countries. It remains unclear what, for example, consensus
politics means in a postcolonial context, in societies in which democracy is a relatively
recent phenomenon, or where very different state practices and social dynamics operate.
It is in this context that we draw on a study of the (post)politics of sustainability
planning in Taipei, Taiwan. We develop Krueger and Gibbs's (2007, page 2) concern that
``the politics of sustainability represents a gap in the current sustainability literature''
that precludes the development of broader conceptual abstractions over development
and change. We explore the interrelationships between writing on postpoliticism and
the concepts and agendas that underpin local sustainability discourses. Taipei repre-
sents an excellent example of a postcolonial context in which there exist significant
development ^ sustainability tensions and a relatively novel democratic system. It is
also `off the map' in dominant Eurocentric writing about urban development and has
embraced the internationally recognised concept of sustainability in its planning frame-
works. We explore, empirically, the complex ways in which state authorities and urban
elites have used postpolitical concepts imported from international organisations, such
as the World Bank and the UN, as a part of a conflict management strategy that seeks
to legitimise contentious and controversial policy agendas.We examine their deployment
in Taipei in which there are particular tensions over the extent to which conflict is seen as
a marker of democratic maturity, on the one hand, and a threat to social and govern-
mental order, on the other. In contrast to Eurocentric experiences, Taipei's case relates to
its specific geopolitical and postcolonial context, in which the translation of `Western'
discourses of governing sustainability have also been regarded as key milestones in its
transition to a cosmopolitan city. In so doing we contribute to the existing literature on
urban sustainability, postpolitical governance, and comparative urbanism and conclude
by exploring the relevance and utility of such approaches to urban politics.
The remainder of the paper is divided into two parts. In the first part we critically
assess debates over postpolitics and urban sustainability as a postpolitical construct.
We develop a sympathetic critique of the work of writers such as Swyngedouw (2009)
and Mouffe (2005) and argue that their arguments raise important empirical and
conceptual questions over the ways in which the postpolitical condition plays out in
practice and how it is constituted. In the second part we provide a contextual overview
of sustainability politics in Taipei (and Taiwan) before discussing, in turn, the institu-
tional structures of sustainability policy that exist, the specific form and character
of policy agendas that have emerged, and the impacts of evolving discourses on policy
practices. We interrogate the relationships between the geographies and spaces of
postpolitics, postcolonial contexts, and global sustainability agendas.
Sustainability as a postpolitical construct
The rise of the postpolitical condition
During the 2000s there was ostensibly a convergence in development planning agendas
across the world, underpinned by dominant, Eurocentric understandings of common
policy problems and solutions (Krueger and Gibbs, 2010). A key element of this
convergence was the move towards sustainability planning in urban and national
192 M Raco, W-I Lin
spaces in which governments, city authorities, and policy communities have sought to
implement the core elements of the UN's Agenda 21 programme and establish their
own sustainability programmes (see, for example, Moore and Bunce, 2009). The UN,
the World Bank, the EU, and others have promoted the concepts of `good governance'
and sustainability in the Global South, often through international agreements
on climate change and environmental regulation (see Brand and Thomas, 2005;
Whitehead, 2007).
For a group of `postpolitical' writers this globalisation of policy constructs reflects
and reproduces progressive and unstoppable processes of change. Postpoliticism's
conceptual origins lie in debates within political science on the changing form and
character of democratic politics under neoliberalism and the propagation of socially
and economically `progressive' forms of Third Way governance in the UK, Western
Europe, and North America. Its key advocates include Beck (2002) and Giddens (1994;
2002) and their writings on what they term posttraditional, reflexive modernisation.
They argue that structural changes in the nature of socioeconomic systems are taking
place in which individuals and communities have transcended the class structures,
national identities, and adversarial politics of industrial modernity and embraced a
`second modernity', characterised by a new `subpolitics' of self-identity, cosmopolitan-
ism, and consensus building. Politics, in short, has moved beyond the old class-infused
categories of Left and Right and is now experienced ``as constraints (and opportunities)
emanating from a variety of sources. Class becomes individualised and expressed
through an individual's biography; it is experienced less and less as a collective fate''
(Giddens, 1994, page 143).
The implications for governance and state action of this postpolitical condition
(cf Rancie
© re, 2006) are profound. As class consciousness has waned, it is argued,
so political processes have become less adversarial and ideological in form. According
to Beck (2000, page 80), existing modes and procedures of representative government,
and even nation-states, therefore act like ``zombiesödead long ago but still haunting
people's minds.'' Politics becomes principally concerned with the formation of consen-
suses and the coproduction of policy between state actors and private and voluntary
sector interests. Within such conceptions there is a wider acceptance of a singular
global (neoliberal) order and a celebration of the move towards a new postnational
cosmopolitanism founded on Kantian ethical principles (see also Appiah, 2006;
Held, 2005; Nussbaum, 1995). Adversarial modes of democracy have little purchase
in a context where ideological battles are no longer fought between collective groups
and interests. The emphasis, instead, should be on the pursuit of policy `effectiveness'
through the mobilisation of `depoliticised' discourses, such as sustainability, around
which all interests can agree and work towards a shared agenda. In countries such
as the UK the Labour government of Tony Blair articulated this modernist politics of
objectivity and problem solving as a way of overcoming the perceived intransigence
of social movements with vested interests that were unable to grasp the fundamental
nature of contemporary global change (see Blair, 2010).
For elites in different urban and national contexts this narrative of a consensus-
based global order opens up new opportunities for the rolling out of globally oriented
agendas and programmes and the (re)designing of political systems. If there is no
alternative but to focus on nonadversarial politics, then democratic systems and policy
agendas need to adapt to the new certainties and shake off their traditional and
antiquated concerns with, for example, collective welfare provision or full employment.
This is particularly true where global bodies such as the UN and the World Bank
actively encourage or force cities and countries to implement sustainability or austerity
programmes in the name of a broader international agenda. It also often involves the
Urban sustainability, conflict management, and the geographies of postpoliticism 193
reshaping of local development practices, techniques of management, and technologies
of government with state agencies adopting quantitative, indicator-based policy
frameworks to implement international programmes and to demonstrate to external
and internal audiences just how effective policy interventions have been. Postpolitical
governance also involves public ^ private partnerships in which the interests and
outlooks of different interests in cities can be brought together to engage in rational
discourse, through which objective, problem-focused policy agendas can be created
and implemented.
Challenging the consensus approach
Whilst these postpolitical imaginaries have come to dominate the policy thinking of
global organisations, they have also been the subject of growing academic criticism.
For Mouffe (2005) they represent a fundamental misunderstanding of the contested
nature of politics and the political. The ideal of a consensus-based politics is an illusion
as `there is no consensus without exclusion, no we without a they, and no politics
is possible without the drawing of a frontier'' (page 73). By denying the existence
of differences, borders, and frontiers, postpolitics undermines the possibilities for
disagreement and what Rancie
© re (2006) terms a `dissensus' to emergeösomething
that is necessary for the formation of a legitimate and effective democratic political
system. These new forms of postpoliticism seek to obfuscate the political conflicts that
underpin policy interventions by limiting the terrains of discourse to the realms of
the procedural and the technical (Mouffe, 2005; Swyngedouw, 2007). Moreover, post-
political writing can also be seen as a Eurocentric perspective that imagines, and seeks
to promote, a political order founded on Western values and modes of thinking about
community, individuality, citizenship, and governance. As Peck et al (2010) demon-
strate, international policy prescriptions are readily adopted by elites in different
countries and cities and are used as `off-the-shelf' solutions to generally defined policy
problems. This process of `cosmpolitanisation' is institutionalised by governing agencies
who promote the neoliberal mantras of minimal state regulation, the freeing up of
markets, and the ideological belief that economic development underpins social,
welfare, and environmental policy (Harvey, 2009). This is the fate of discourses and
agendas, such as those of sustainability, that seek to generate a global convergence in
development thinking, whilst ostensibly furthering `progressive' and `inclusive' agendas.
Indeed, in some places this form of policy convergence is seen by elites as a develop-
ment marker or a sign of progress that can be used to legitimate the rolling out of
programmes that may be particularly controversial and highly selective in their choice
of priorities and outcomes (Lu, 2000; Raco et al, 2011).
Third Way discourses also underplay the disciplinary power inherent in `non-
ideological', output-focused programmes and plans. As Keil (2007) notes, global
`encouragements' to adopt international agreements and standards often go hand in
hand with punitive sanctions and/or threats of ostracisation if local actors fail to
demonstrably adapt to international demands. Such demands can take a variety of
forms, including political changes, economic liberalisation, and cultural demands for
governments and societies to adopt certain ethical positions, practices, or attitudes
towards the natural environment (see Z
í iz
 ek, 2009). As Mouffe (2005) points out in
her trenchant critique of postpolitical writings, one of the core disciplinary elements
of the new agendas is that politics has become `moralised' into a simple battle of right
versus wrong, or good versus evil, in which there are no grounds for compromise or
debate. Whilst a `good governance' model appears to be inclusive and commonsensical,
it will always be grounded in selective and power-infused modes of thinking and acting
in which
194 M Raco, W-I Lin
``we are still faced with political friend/enemy discriminations but they are now
expressed using the vocabulary of morality ... when opponents are defined not in
political but in moral terms, they cannot be envisaged as an adversary but only
as an enemy'' (pages 75 ^ 76).
The shift towards internationally defined modes of good governance can, therefore,
as Appiah (1998, page 94) warns, readily become a `deadening urge to uniformity', with
local translations and interpretations merely becoming, as Butler (1995) notes,
``[an] imposition[s] of a universal claim on a culture that resists it, or that those who
defend the universal will domesticate the challenge posed by alterity by invoking
that very cultural claim as an example of its own nascent universality, one which
confirms that such a universality is already achieved'' (page 51).
In practical terms this often equates with a ``politicisation of sustainability that
[has] shifted responsibility for sustainability from the global capitalist corporations
to different cities, communities and individuals'' (Keil, 2007, pages 45 ^ 46; see also
Summerville et al, 2008).
However, despite these more abstract criticisms of postpolitical constructs, there
remain significant gaps in our understanding of their influence in situ and the broader
geographies of postpoliticism. There are few detailed explorations of exactly how post-
political agendas are constructed in particular places (if at all) and the rationalities
that underpin them in different cities and countries. The critics of postpolitical writing
often use generalities and conceptual discussions to frame their writing, but it remains
unclear who the agents of this postpolitical condition actually are in different contexts
and how and why political constructs such as `sustainability' take on specific forms.
Moreover, even if policy agendas appear to take on postpolitical forms and rational-
ities, this does not necessarily mean that very real divergences and conflicts have been,
or can easily be, eradicated. As Delanty (2006) argues, many constructs that seem to be
widely shared and/or global in nature actually take on locally specific characteristics
so that ``the logic of translation has extended beyond the simple belief that everything
can be translated to the recognition that every culture can translate itself and others ...
and something new is created'' (page 43). For Delanty policy transfer always becomes
enmeshed in existing institutional frameworks and multiscale political projects. It may
not always be possible for elite groups to suppress or deny the existence of conflicts
and difference. By seeking to do so they may, in fact, precipitate new conflicts or
rekindle smouldering discontents (see Barnett, 2010).
We might, therefore, expect the form of democratic politics in postcolonial cities to
differ significantly from those found in more established democratic systems. In many
cases politics is dominated by elites, sustained by the legacies of earlier colonial
structures of governance (see Holliday, 2007). Urban politics in such contexts often
comes to reflect and reproduce broader geopolitical and nationalist tensions that arise
over issues such as sovereignty, governance, and developmentalism. The institutional-
isation of postpolitical agendas takes on specific geographical forms and meanings and
combines with existing processes in complex and grounded ways. In many instances
they are readily adopted by policy elites to provide a nucleus around which to manage
conflicts and to establish `inclusive' agendas that, in practice, serve to marginalise
more radical and critical social movements and political agendas in the name of
modernisation, progress, and policy relevance.
And it is in such contexts that sustainability has come to represent an archetypal
postpolitical construct. The term expresses and embodies a seemingly nonconflictual,
common sense set of aspirations and goals around which disparate interests can unite
to form common programmes of action. It simultaneously opens up opportunities for
scientists and experts to devise technocratic solutions to urban problems; provides a
Urban sustainability, conflict management, and the geographies of postpoliticism 195
political platform for a broad range of social and environmental groups to find
common purpose; enables businesses to publicly showcase their social responsibility
credentials; and allows governments and policy makers to establish new grounds for
the construction of partnerships and consensus-based forms of politics at multiple
scales (Brand and Thomas, 2005; Whitehead, 2007). Sustainability's inherent cosmo-
politanism is bound up with its concern for the human species, the global risks
associated with environmental (and economic) crisis, and its promise of a sustained
future of growth for all (see Harvey, 2009; Nussbaum, 1995).
In the remainder of the paper we now interrogate the evolution of sustainable
development agendas in the East Asian city of Taipei, Taiwan. We draw on an ongoing
research programme that has examined spatial policy and regeneration agendas in the
city and the recent emergence of an explicit `sustainability agenda' in its planning
frameworks. The research has been conducted over a period of four years (from 2006
to 2010) and has involved repeated interviews with city planners, policy makers, busi-
ness leaders, and civil society advocates. In total, twenty-six interviews were completed.
Taipei was selected as it represents a particularly salient example of processes of
political change and modernisation in action. It is a fast-growing, postcolonial city
and has witnessed remarkable demographic, political, economic, and environmental
changes since the mid-1960s (Cheng, 2001; Huang, 2005). Development planning has
long been a key political battleground for different interests. Some have argued that a
better quality of life for citizens will result from the imposition of new regulations and
controls on the development interests and elites who have dominated the postwar
politics of development (Chou, 1999; Lee et al, 2005). Others call for a freeing up of
the planning system as a platform for enhanced competitiveness and growth. During the
1990s and 2000s the discourse of sustainability has been shoehorned onto these existing
conflicts in an attempt to postpoliticise them through the establishment of `mainstream',
consensus-based visions and agendas.
Under the global and local pressures: the rise of Taiwanese sustainable development
The recent emergence of a sustainability agenda in Taiwan has been forged through a
complex mix of global and local political pressures. There is nothing new in this as
Taiwan's history is dominated by colonial and postcolonial tensions, stretching back
over 300 years with its successive incorporation into the Dutch Spanish, and Japanese
empires. After the second world war the Kuomintang (KMT) ruled the island under an
`authoritarian developmentalism' and a military preparedness, so that ``from the 1960s
on economic development, with which to make Taiwan a model of socio-economic
progress, became an over-riding goal that was to support, but not supplant, the long
term objective of retaking the mainland [China]'' (Cheng, 1989, page 481). Since the
late 1980s the island has experienced a rapid process of democratisation that, as Lin
(1999, page 2) notes, has become a role model for others to follow ``among the world's
transitioning democracies''.
In the process of this democratisation, environmental sustainability and economic
developmentalism have become one of the most contentious and divisive issues facing
the new democracy. Opposition parties, NGOs, and social and environmental groups
increasingly argue that the KMT's postwar focus on modernising Taiwan through
economic development meant a long-term neglect of the environment, particularly in
the island's main metropolises of Taipei and Kaohsiung (Hsiao, 1999; Tang and Tang,
1997). There has been the growth of an enhanced `environmental consciousness' and a
more focused awareness of the dangers of environmental overexploitation. This, more
than any other issue, has kindled local protests and resistance to state and/or big
business-led development plans and industrial projects (Hsiao, 1999). For the Taiwanese
196 M Raco, W-I Lin
authorities defusing these tensions and building a new set of more consensual agendas
have become key policy objectives.
At the same time the 1980s and 1990s also saw external international pressure being
applied to Taiwan to adopt global benchmarks and standards in relation to environ-
mental and economic sustainability. For example, since 1992 NGOs, including the UK's
Environmental Investigative Association, have launched active campaigns through
global media networks to criticise the Taiwanese government of facilitating the illegal
trade of endangered species and of breaking international protection agreements such
as the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (EIA, 2005).
CITES signatories have ``urged its members to impose available sanctions'' (Lin, 2009,
page 24) in response, and the USA imposed a selective trade embargo on Taiwan under
the Pelly Amendment in 1994 (Charnovitz, 1994). This case has been used by central
government to caution the Taiwanese against standing up to international `norms' and
`expectations' that could produce a international ``perception that the Taiwanese only
care about making money, not environment at all'' (RDEC, 2006, page 13). However,
the Taiwanese state's response to this negative publicity abroad and growing discontent
at home has been to seek to change the attitudes of its population and to encourage the
formation of more Western, globally oriented outlooks. As one interviewee explained,
Taiwan cannot ignore growing international pressures if Taiwan's society and citizens
continue to ``neglect its perceived disinterest in adopting international standards
and priorities then this could harm Taiwan's international reputation and economic
growth.''
Taiwan's adoption of sustainability agendas since the early 1990s, such as the
institutionalisation of the National Council of Sustainable Development (NCSD) and
Agenda 21 Taiwan programme, could be regarded as a series of political responses to
the pressures exerted by international bodies (Lin, 2008; Liu et al, 2005). This process
of institutional reform has been designed to enable Taiwanese governments to demon-
strate to an external audience that they are pushing through an international agenda,
whilst at the same time establishing the institutional capacities necessary to tackle
environmental and development problems within the country. In the words of the
then Minister of the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC),
Taiwan's government should tackle its sense of powerlessness in the wake of interna-
tional sustainability agendas, in which it has felt compelled to adopt international
norms and ``merely adopt them passively'' (Yeh, 2005, page 12; Yeh and Shi, 2005).(1)
It should, instead, participate with international organisations and conferences and
establish platforms to contest external discourses, otherwise, in the words of one
interviewee, policy makers may ``suffer beatings without opportunities to retort'' (see
NCSD, 2006; RDEC, 2006). Thus, Taiwan would achieve acceptance and recognition
only if it explicitly adopted a good governance approach and established bodies that
could drive such an agenda forward.
As we will demonstrate in the remainder of the paper, political elites in Taiwan
have used these global sustainability agendas to facilitate the introduction of a new
wave of local government reforms, particularly through the delivery of Taiwan's Local
Agenda 21 programme. The importation and translation of such agendas refers not
only to the formation and institutionalisation of a postpolitical consensus around
sustainability but also to a postcolonial construction of global cosmopolitanism.
In the next section we begin by examining and assessing postpolitical sustainability
and planning practices in Taiwan's largest and most significant city, Taipei, and the
ways in which the concept of sustainability has been translated and institutionalised.

Urban sustainability, conflict management, and the geographies of postpoliticism 197
The postpolitics of sustainability planning in Taipei
Taipei has long been regarded as the economic, political, and cultural capital of
Taiwan. Its development, prosperity, and international reputation are critical to the
country's domestic development and international competitiveness (Kwok and Hsu,
2005; Raco et al, 2011). Its primacy has made it a centre for protest in which citizens
demonstrate against central government and leading politicians (Lii and Lin, 2003;
Tang and Tang, 1997). According to Hsiao and Liu (2002, page 77), ``hundreds of
protests took place in the Taipei metropolitan area between 1980 and 1996'', or more
than one fifth of all environmental protests of Taiwan during this period. Compared
with other industrial cities, Taipei has benefited from the absence of extensive indus-
trial pollution, but rapid growth has created severe supply-side shortages and pressures
in relation to overcrowding and most significantly housing affordability. Between 1986
and 1989 the average house price increased by 274.5% (Chang, 1990; Xu, 2006).
This was a long-running source of discontent, and little was done by elected govern-
ments to tackle it. And by 2010 the director of central government's Construction
and Planning Agency admitted publicly that Taipei's average house prices have now
increased to fourteen times the average income of residents, double the Taiwan aver-
age.(2) Moreover, the city's population density is 7.5 times that of Taiwan's average, and
the amount of public green space per capita is less than 40%.(3) These sustainability
issues result from development-led and `world city' policies that seek to transform the
city into a ``real estate profit machine'' (Hsiao and Liu, 2002, page 71). It is in this
context that a new postpolitics of sustainability planning has emerged to tackle the
perceived tension between developmentalism, on the one hand, and environmental
protection, on the other. This has involved two elements: institutional reform of the
city's policy-making processes; and the mobilisation of specific forms of expert-led,
indicator-based modes of governance. Each of these will now be assessed in turn.
Institutional reform and the mobilisation of a sustainability agenda
The launch of a sustainability agenda in Taipei has involved a deliberate attempt to
create `new' institutional assemblages that differ from the old politically charged and
development-focused local government structures of the postwar period. The emphasis
has ostensibly been on the development of more inclusive, reflexive, and deliberative
forms of governance and decision making in a context of growing uncertainty, unpre-
dictability, and ambivalence, or what Beck and Sznaider (2006) term `reflexive
modernity' (see also Vob and Kemp, 2006). This is exemplified by the most significant
initiative, the foundation of the Taipei Sustainable Development Committee (TSDC) in
2004, which was designed to oversee policy-making processes in a cross-departmental,
cross-sectoral, and postpolitical way. The TSDC promotes a sustainability agenda
founded on
``local self-governance, strengthening the interaction between local government and the
public, and encouraging the public to participate in environmental protection and
social activities and to play an active role in promoting sustainable development''
(CEPD, 2004, page 55).
It is ostensibly designed to be an inclusive body that acts as a hybrid between
participative and representative systems of governance. It is chaired by the Mayor,
and its board includes leaders from different Taipei City Government (TCG) depart-
ments, local professionals and scholars, representatives from business and social groups,
and environmental NGOs (see TCG, 2004a, pages 2 ^ 4). There are seven `working

(3) According to Taiwan's National Statistics (2010) at http://eng.stat.gov.tw/mp.asp?mp=5
198 M Raco, W-I Lin
teams' tasked to develop programmes around: sustainable development visions; water
and land resources; industries and biodiversity; sustainable transportation; sustainable
society; sustainable education; and international environmental protection. Each depart-
ment of the TCG is required to join several of these teams to work together on
coordinated tasks and policy agendas, rather than focusing only on their own admin-
istrative responsibilities. Such interdepartmental working is designed to promote new
forms of consensus building by breaking down `silo mentalities' and the scope and scale
of institutionalised policy conflicts.
Its core aim has been to produce strategies that seek to realise `sustainable devel-
opment' through local action and visions of Taipei as an `eco-city' (TCG, 2004a).
Despite this stated aim, it continues to reflect and reproduce international agendas
and discourses taken directly from the UN and/or other more `progressive' and `devel-
oped' countries. For example, the TCG (2004b, page 6) highlights the UN's agenda as
a starting point for policy, and it ``has been regarded as an action principle to practice
sustainable development from global, regional and national scales.'' Through conveying
the commonly adopted concept of sustainable developmentösuch as the balanced three
pillars between environment, economy, and societyöthe TCG aims to promote what
Beck and Sznaider (2006, page 11) term ``a cosmopolitan outlook in which people view
themselves simultaneously as part of a threatened world and as part of their local
situations and histories'' (see also Davidson, 2009).
Alongside the UN charters it is the UK planning system and its sustainable com-
munity agendas that are seen as role models for Taiwanese policy makers and planners.
London, in particular, is presented by the TSDC and its advisors as a comparative,
global city that Taipei should emulate (TCG, 2004a; 2004b). The UK government's
Egan Review: Skills for Sustainable Communities (DCLG, 2004) and The Greater
London Authority's A Sustainable Development Framework for London (LSDC, 2002)
were singled out as templates for the formation of Taipei's core sustainability goals and
strategies on the grounds that, like London and the UK,
``Taiwan is an island country, and Taipei is its capital ... . In order to connect
[TCG's] declarations and promises [of pursuing sustainable development] with the
international context, developing such declarations would be more appropriate to
refer to the similar type of countries' capitals ... . Thus, A Sustainable Development
Framework for London ... is regarded as the main reference for Taipei'' (TCG, 2004b,
page 21).
In 2004 the TCG (2004a, page 2-1; 2004b) adopted London's stated ``Goals and
Objectives'' as templates for its Sustainable Development Framework and its so-called
``Four Promises'' of ``determination and innovation, action and capability, responsibility
and oversight, respect and success.'' In direct echoes of the London plans, the overall
objective for planning policy is now to
``build a global standard capital city with a combination of three targets: cyclic
symbiosis of environment and resources/progress sharing in secure society/intelligent
growth of economy and technologies'' (TCG, 2004a, page 2).
These objectives underpin Taipei's stated ambition to become a global city that is
able to balance economic competitiveness with environmental and social cohesion.
It uses the consensual language of sustainability to critique postwar development
planning and gives credence to a broader postpolitical `modernisation' agenda for
government and governance systems. Thus, the principal purpose and objective of
policy is to demonstrate that Taipei is becoming a `proper', `developed' international
city, able to play its full part in the rolling out of a sustainability agenda even though,
as one planning official admitted in interview, ``no one really knows how we can prac-
tise this [sustainability] concept.'' International discourses have played an important
Urban sustainability, conflict management, and the geographies of postpoliticism 199
political role in helping to legitimise a change of emphasis in development policy and
what could have been controversial governance reforms, and it is to the form and content
of these agendas that we now turn.
Reframing accountability and the mobilisation of indicator-led governance
One core feature of postpolitical governance and consensus building is the shift
towards output-centred government, focused on expert-led `pragmatism' and a `what
matters is what works' approach to policy. Reform is often carried out through the
deployment of `objective' and internationally comparable indicators that mimic those of
more developed cities. As Swyngedouw (2007; 2009) points out, the effects of this are
that politics proper is progressively replaced by expert social administration, so that
antagonistic political debates are replaced by an instrumental rationality and manage-
rialism based on `technocratic ^ scientific' knowledge. In Taiwan such indicator-based
forms of policy construction have represented a `technology of government' that seeks
to remove sources of political conflict within civil society and to demonstrate internally
and externally just how `cosmopolitan' and `international' the city's dominant con-
ceptions of sustainability are. In Rose's (2006, page 147) terms the mobilisation of
indicators in this way represents ``a kind of intellectual machinery or apparatus for
rendering reality thinkable in such a way that it is amenable.''
Responsibility for indicator development has been given to local civil servants,
sustainable development committees, and local government appointees, including aca-
demics and third-sector representatives (CEPD, 2004). For central government and the
TCG the development of these indicators has been regarded as the crucial method
of controlling broader political conflicts over development policy. And yet this appeal
to objectivity and transparency masks a contested politics. Some indicators, such as
the UN's `Urban Indicators Programme' and `Human Development Index' (see TCG,
2004c), have been shoehorned onto existing government datasets, such as those
produced by the National Council for Economic and Development and the TCG
(for example, Huang et al, 1998; Lee, 2002; see also Lee et al, 2008; TCG, 2004c).
A complex and rather muddled mix of indicator systems has emerged that fulfils
postpolitical objectives by converting controversial decisions and political demands
into technical and methodological questions. Rather than opening up formal political
discussion within the population over development objectives, policy has been reduced
to a bureaucratic debate framed by discussions between experts and policy makers.
In practice, this has given policy makers the opportunity to reframe the city's
development objectives in quite radical ways, whilst limiting sources of controversy
and dissensus. For example, at one of its founding workshops (17 March 2004) the
TSDC's Action Team concluded that in order to develop enhanced `global connections'
a key objective for policy should be to collect international indicators and replicate
them in Taipei. These included the World Bank's `World Development Indicators';
sustainability indicators from the UK, USA, and Canada; and the OECD (TCG,
2004c). The initial stages of this process involved a rather crude clumping together of
existing indicator sets into five core lists comprising a `grand list' of 118 indicators
including all of those found on international lists references. This initial list was later
pared down to forty eight in the name of management efficiency as civil servants were
having significant difficulties in collecting and analysing relevant data (TGC workshop,
31 March 2004).
The (postpolitical) processes through which this `streamlining' took place reveal
much about the character of the city's politics. The TCG (2004c, page 1) argued that
they were to be decided by participants from different sectors and organisations, with
civil servants and experts acting only as ``guides or early warnings in the process of
200 M Raco, W-I Lin
making policies and decisions of sustainable development.'' A city-wide survey,
workshops, and discussion forums were held, ostensibly to shape the process.
However, as our interviewees revealed, in reality most of the indicators were pre-
selected and defined by TCG departments. Two main questions from the survey were
thought relevant by experts: (a) whether indicators could play a role in establishing
``the long or medium term action plans of departments''; and (b) ``whether these target-
led indicators should be suggested by members for the TCG to be monitored'' (TCG,
2004a, page 27). Rather than breaking open the decision-making process, the use of
indicators generated new forms of bureaucratic ^ expert empowerment. Under the cover
of objective and `rational' policymaking more challenging and complex socioeconomic
and environmental concerns have been marginalised from core debates.
Moreover, all forty-eight key indicators are based on quantitative and technocratic ^
scientific representations of socioenvironmental and economic sustainability. It is
perhaps not surprising that following these discussions most indicators focus on
quantifiable environmental and economic aspects of development, such as the quantity
of urban green spaces found in Taipei and the effectiveness of refuse recycling pro-
grammes, but refer less to social indicators or inequalities of income and opportunity.
As one local scholar involved in the process explained in interview,
``departments are concerned more about face-saving issues and their reputations.
Thus, they are very selective in picking up indicators ... they don't want to choose
certain indicators that will expose serious problems that could make whole citizens
come to blame their department.''
The focus on departmental-led work and more `efficient' processes of governance
has been used to limit debates and facilitate consensus building. It also means that
more contentious demands have been taken out of the political sphere and converted
into `objective' and `neutral' targets to be monitored. As an interviewee from the TCG
who helped to formulate these indicators explained, ``qualitative indicators, no matter
whether they come from the UN or other western countries, are more likely to be
questionable and disputed ... they were not seen as objective enough to measure
sustainability.'' In other words, only quantitative data and measures were accepted as
being relevant to sustainability policy because they fitted in with governmental practices.
The consequence of this exclusion is that other forms of knowledge, experience, and
ways of thinking become structurally excluded from policy frameworks.
The TCG (2004c, page 51) states there are still twelve indicators of measuring
so-called ``progress-sharing in secure society''. Nonetheless, these indicators refer directly
to social security and population characteristicsösuch as crime rates, literacy rate of
adults, and the number of citizens who participate in cultural activitiesörather than
mapping social inequality and deprivation. In interview a senior planning official
candidly illustrated ``if you ask us what is sustainability and a sustainable community,
we can give you a `correct' answeröit is the joining-up of environmental, industrial and
social concerns. But there is a big gap between knowing and doing.'' Another planning
officer reflected in interview: ``we still do not want to understand or face up to pressing
social issues that are too complicated and/or tough to deal with.'' For instance, whilst
certain indicators, taken mainly from the UN's `Global Urban Indicators' (GUIs),(4)
do refer to the measurement of social equity and the equal access to housing credit, the
comparison between household incomes and the price of housing and land are all
excluded from the TCG's (2004a; 2004b) key indicators. They are regarded merely as
descriptive indicators that do not relate to the TCG's (2004a) key sustainability targets.
As an official of Taipei's Urban Redevelopment Office noted in interview:

programmes/guo/guo_guide.asp#ind2
Urban sustainability, conflict management, and the geographies of postpoliticism 201
``urban renewal and regeneration should be a public issue, but we do not really think
about the public. I used to have a joke with the staff of our office that we are there
to assist developers to tackle their problems and make their projects.''
Such views exemplify the ways in which these policy discussions and targets setting
seem to circumscribe Taipei's more contentious planning issues or to establish lowest
common denominator themes that will not raise controversy. Policy has been based on
`idealist' notions of urban competitiveness and sustainability representing ``compatible
strategic political and policy goals'' (Jonas and While, 2007, page 124). This process
has become even more pronounced in recent years, and we turn to a discussion of its
evolution and impacts in the following section.
The evolution of sustainability politics in Taipei
Since the late 2000s city and national governments have given greater priority to the
objective of reframing Taipei and Taiwan's position as central players within interna-
tional networks and environmental and developmental policy debates. This partly
reflects deep-seated anxieties amongst policy makers that Taiwan will continue to be
seen as an industrial economic `tiger', seemingly unconcerned with environmental
protection. Moreover, its delisting as an official, sovereign state by the UN in 1971
also threatened its international standing. As the RDEC (2006, page 13) openly states,
``after losing our position in the United Nations, no one informs us about the inter-
national covenants and regulations beginning worldwide. We have had a very poor
understanding of them.'' The adoption of sustainability norms, particularly in relation
to Taiwan's flagship capital city, is a critical element in this debate as it demonstrates to
external audiences and its citizens Taiwan's ability and desire to act as an independent
and cosmopolitan state and is evidence of its growing global status.
International conferences and forums have provided one avenue through which
policy makers have sought to overcome this perceived international marginalisation,
and create an image of being globalising. For example, in 2005 the Mayor of the TCG
attended the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) World Environment
Day in San Francisco and, joined with another fifty-three cities to pledge their support
and sign the UNEP's `Urban Environmental Accords'. Since then, pursuing the
international agenda, certification, and criteria of developing a `green city', healthy
community, and the eco-city have become priorities for the TSDC and the TCG
(see DEP, 2008; UNEP, 2005). These new criteria have been readily, and uncritically,
imposed directly by the TSDC onto Taipei's sustainability strategies, with little negotia-
tion. Moreover, since 2008 new priorities have also emerged to make Taiwan a `Healthy
City' and to attain international recognition from the World Health Organization.
Twelve `Community Districts' have rapidly been identified and targeted for action
across the city to support this agenda (DEP, 2008).
However, the effects and impacts of these complex indicators or systems on develop-
ment practices have actually been quite limited, highlighting the limits of consensus-based
`pragmatic', postpolitical programmes of action to affect significant change. Instead, as
a local scholar who has participated in this development observed in interview, many
indicators ``seem to be put on the shelf for reference only'' rather than being employed to
develop a long-term strategy. There is little evidence of policy evaluation, even in the terms
set out by the TSDC. In interview a TCG senior planning official recalled that
``[the TSG] is under a delusion that expects that the city will be made sustainable
through the development and operation of an indicator system, but they didn't
really consider ... how these indicators can be really exercised, how the administra-
tion of sustainability can really be sustained, how can government really activate
citizens to participate.''
202 M Raco, W-I Lin
On the surface, while the TCG is keen to pursue `cosmopolitan' sustainability
agendas, it is highly questionable whether such agendas can make Taipei moderate
the city's environmental and social conflicts. Data from the TCG's Department of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DBAS, 2011) show that the number of disputes
over public nuisance and pollution increased from 26 496 in 2004 to 66 053 in 2010.
Land prices have increased by 40%, unemployment has risen from 3.5% up to 5.6%,
and living costs have increased by approximately 10%. Moreover, in the name of
sustainable `development', the TCG is also pushing to redevelop the city's limited green
spaces, around areas such as the Quan-Du conservation area and Nan-Gang district,
as so-called ecocommunitiesöindustrial parks of biotechnology or ecotourism (see
COSMOS, 2011; DUD, 2009). Some of the main rationales for these redevelopments,
as a local researcher commented in interview, ``are for property development and specu-
lation.'' Since 2009 these redevelopment projects have resulted in new arguments or
conflicts between residents, environmental protectors, developers, and city government.
For example, in terms of the government's project of redeveloping the green space
in Nan-Gang district, a well-known local commentator Xiao-Feng Zhang (2010) has
protested that the development is similar to ``cutting the lungs of Taipei''.(5) These
conflicts or protests usually cause temporary public attention and are often eclipsed
by the government's dominant practices of postpolitical representations of sustainable
development as a technical practice.
Such practices attempt to squeeze out dissensus and conflicts by giving little
recognition to the growing divisions between different groups around Taipei. There is
a focus on the environment as a collective, binding object of government around which
new forms of consensus can be established and exercised. For community activists
and those involved in grassroots political organisation, this (post)political environ-
ment is the cause of much frustration and pressure. As one commented on the TCG's
sustainable programmes in interview:
``[officials] usually do not consider and evaluate whether their programmes can
achieve the purposes of sustainability ... . For us, sitting here to look up at [them],
we only can take a government's project, and just do it, but we don't really know
what are the outcomes and influences.''
As the activist went on to argue, international terms and concepts such as eco-
communities have generated much confusion, and ``local residents have not been able
to digest such concepts or make sense of them.'' Nonetheless, local residents seem to be
in a dilemma between following such concepts uncritically or being sanctioned by
disqualification from government funding. Since 2008 the TCG's main funding for
local communities to propose and improve their own neighbourhoods has been trans-
ferred to support state-led projects on the defined themes of green or sustainable
development, such as the Taipei International Flora Exposition and the building of a
so-called ecocommunity. In order to strive for the funding, local communities are
under pressure to learn from the government's preregulated agendas and demonstrate
their capability to deliver or match up such agendas.
Moreover, the desire to demonstrate policy effectiveness to international bodies
and citizens has led to new forms of spatial selectivity on the part of the TCG and to
some extent Taiwan's central government. For instance, there has been a new push
towards the creation of `exemplar' communities that have `succeeded' in national and
international terms. By 2007 this had become a more explicit policy in which
the mayor asked the TCG's departments to establish ``safe communities and eco-
communities'' and ``be active to find out some possible models, through direct support
(5) Zhang has published a letter to the current President on Taiwan's United Daily News (Zhang,
2010) about her arguments and protests (see 4 May 2010).
Urban sustainability, conflict management, and the geographies of postpoliticism 203
and a certification system to transform them into Taipei's development models''
(TSDC's 12th meeting, 23 March 2007). However, as a senior community planner
noted in interview, the selected model communities are in the ``better areas, in which
more active citizens live'', and in which there is often a track record of `successful' local
projects. While these model projects have been employed by the TCG to show an image
of `sustainable Taipei' (for example, DEP, 2008), neighbourhoods with more substantial
and significant socioeconomic and environmental problems have found themselves
`increasingly marginalised'. Their existence seems to be a cause of some embarrassment
to policy makers intent on demonstrating just how developed and westernised Taiwan
has become.
The above practices represent the management of conflicts between concepts of
sustainability and development, in which the TCG seeks to exert the disciplinary power
and preregulated consensus of postpolitical sustainability through leading schemes and
funding and to create a cosmopolitan outlook or illusion of being sustainable to
support Taipei's further entrepreneurial (re)development. The election of a new mayor
in 2007, and growing global economic instability, has shifted policy thinking and
priorities. At his first meeting of the TSDC (23 March 2007) he claimed to make
sustainable development his ``top priority'', but, as a regeneration official pointed out
in interview, the core meaning of this agenda has changed:
``I don't think the issue of environmental sustainability is the current Mayor's
priority ... . Even they can find some subjects to discuss these will still be put
behind the issues of urban competitiveness ... they pick up some easier one to do,
such as reducing the carbon and power consumption.''
This masking of economic development agendas under the cloak of sustainability is
perhaps best reflected in recent flagship projects, such as the construction of a new
Science Technology Park and an International Conference Centre. Both were built with
government funds and also involved significant tax breaks and subsidies to foreign
investors and their `creative workers'.
The financial crisis of 2008 ^ 09 has only deepened some of these tensions. Whilst
there exists the possibility that the recession will highlight how ``alternative ways of
shaping our cities become possible'' (Evans et al, 2009, page 694), in the context of Taipei
the opposite seems to be emerging with agendas taking on a more collective, postpolitical,
consensual form focused on the need to generate new forms of economic growth.
As a chief planner explained in interview: ``I think Taipei still has great anxiety about
competing with other Asian cities ... to attract international investors, investments and
factories ... to make international or big companies willing to settle here.'' Or in the
words of the city's mayor at his inaugural speech following his reelection in December
2010, ``I will ... improve Taipei's urban competitiveness with all my strength to compete
with Tokyo, Seoul and Shanghai'' (see TCG, 2011). The political controversies involved
in this process of providing for investors have, in part, been mollified by the imple-
mentation of postpolitical structures and processes. `Sustainability planning' is
increasingly used to complement economic development strategies by producing more
attractive environments for developers' property-led development, influential companies,
and `new urbanism' of their employees or the upper middle class.
Conclusions
In this paper we have used the example of the politics of sustainable development
planning in Taipei to shed light on broader debates over the relationships between
postpolitics, sustainability, and the internationalisation of development discourses.
In Taipei there have been clear efforts to turn sustainability policy into a postpolitical
construct that deflects attention away from some of the growing tensions now emerging
204 M Raco, W-I Lin
over rising inequalities, unequal and patchy access to housing and welfare services, and
the impact of dilapidated and polluted urban environments on the day-to-day lives of
citizens and communities. The city government's growing emphasis on internationalisa-
tion and global city status is likely to accentuate and magnify some of the inequalities
that currently exist, and for policymakers the rolling out of an ostensibly consensual
and inclusive policy of sustainability can, it is hoped, pave the way for the implemen-
tation of potentially unpopular reforms and policy measures that look to provide
substantial financial support to elite groups. Whilst there is nothing new in these
political controversies surrounding sustainability planning, their incorporation into
a postpolitical agenda represents a deliberate attempt to change the focus of policy
debates and shift them towards collective, problem-solving approaches that minimise
conflict and promote partnership working.
This example provides empirical evidence of the forms that postpolitical processes
take in diverse, non-western contexts. Taipei's specific take on sustainability planning
can be understood only in relation to its postwar development, the changing politics of
democracy in the country, its specific geopolitical position, and the form and character
of its civil and postcolonial society. The rolling-out of a postpolitical agenda is part of
an elitist programme of government that aims to integrate Taipei much more closely
into international networks so that the city can gain further international recognition.
This, in turn, is a policy supported by national governments that are keen to use
Taipei's international position as a springboard for broader economic and political
projects. There is the added complexity of Taiwan's international status. Debates
over reunification with mainland China continue apace, and attempts to obtain
broader recognition of Taipei and Taiwan's global credentials have to be seen in this
postcolonial light.
Policy makers now face a series of dilemmas. The presence of an active and vibrant
civil society is a symbol of a `mature' democracy that has moved away from earlier
periods of dictatorship and colonial oppression. However, the expansion of such
conflict invites a loss of control and opens up spaces for vehement opposition to state
projects, particularly in relation to economic development and its environmental
impacts. It is in this context that postpolitical, Third Way discourses become so
appealing. By converting governance into a more technical, consensual, `Western-like'
exercise of project management and delivery, democracy becomes relegated to a
process of conferring support to projects and programmes that could meet a wider
national interest and development-led ideology and leading politicians' visions.
However, we have also drawn attention to the limits of postpolitical agendas.
We indicate that, despite the mobilisation of postpolitical arrangements, conflict and
dissensus have not been eradicated, but replaced. They are increasingly finding expres-
sion in protest movements and nonconformist modes of political intervention as social
groups seek alternative ways of articulating their agendas. In some instances the denial
of social and environmental conflict is even generating new antagonisms as some of the
social, economic, and environmental costs of global city visions become increasingly
apparent. For authors such as Rancie
© re this reassertion of the political condition is
a direct consequence of postpolitical attempts to repress it. A clear area for further
research is, therefore, an assessment of not only how postpolitical discourses are
constructed but also the extent to which they matter for the day-to-day politics and
development of cities.
