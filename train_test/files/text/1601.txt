More than 200 known diseases are transmit-
ted through food (1). The causes of foodborne
illness include viruses, bacteria, parasites,
toxins, metals, and prions, and the symptoms of
foodborne illness range from mild gastroenteritis
to life-threatening neurologic, hepatic, and renal
syndromes. In the United States, foodborne
diseases have been estimated to cause 6 million
to 81 million illnesses and up to 9,000 deaths
each year (2-5). However, ongoing changes in the
food supply, the identification of new foodborne
diseases, and the availability of new surveillance
data have made these figures obsolete. New,
more accurate estimates are needed to guide
prevention efforts and assess the effectiveness of
food safety regulations.
Surveillance of foodborne illness is compli-
catedbyseveralfactors.Thefirstisunderreporting.
Although foodborne illnesses can be severe or
even fatal, milder cases are often not detected
through routine surveillance. Second, many
pathogens transmitted through food are also
spread through water or from person to person,
thus obscuring the role of foodborne transmis-
sion. Finally, some proportion of foodborne
illness is caused by pathogens or agents that
have not yet been identified and thus cannot be
diagnosed. The importance of this final factor
cannot be overstated. Many of the pathogens of
greatest concern today (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni,
Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes,
Cyclospora cayetanensis) were not recognized as
causes of foodborne illness just 20 years ago.
In this article, we report new estimates of
illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths due to
foodborne diseases in the United States. To
ensure their validity, these estimates have been
derived by using data from multiple sources,
including the newly established Foodborne
Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet).
The figures presented include estimates for
specific known pathogens, as well as overall
estimates for all causes of foodborne illness,
known, unknown, infectious, and noninfectious.
Data Sources
Data sources for this analysis include the
Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Net-
work (FoodNet) (6), the National Notifiable
Disease Surveillance System (7), the Public
Health Laboratory Information System (8), the
Gulf Coast States Vibrio Surveillance System (9),
the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance
System (10), the National Ambulatory Medical
Care Survey (11), the National Hospital
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (12-14), the
To better quantify the impact of foodborne diseases on health in the United States,
we compiled and analyzed information from multiple surveillance systems and other
sources. We estimate that foodborne diseases cause approximately 76 million
illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths in the United States each year.
Known pathogens account for an estimated 14 million illnesses, 60,000
hospitalizations, and 1,800 deaths. Three pathogens, Salmonella, Listeria, and
Toxoplasma, are responsible for 1,500 deaths each year, more than 75% of those
caused by known pathogens, while unknown agents account for the remaining 62
million illnesses, 265,000 hospitalizations, and 3,200 deaths. Overall, foodborne
diseases appear to cause more illnesses but fewer deaths than previously estimated.

Established in 1996, FoodNet is a collabora-
tive effort by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and
selected state health departments. FoodNet
conducts active surveillance for seven bacterial
and two parasitic foodborne diseases within a
defined population of 20.5 million Americans (6).
Additional surveys conducted within the FoodNet
catchment area provide information on the
frequency of diarrhea in the general population,
the proportion of ill persons seeking care, and the
frequency of stool culturing by physicians and
laboratories for selected foodborne pathogens.
The National Notifiable Disease Surveillance
System (7) and the Public Health Laboratory
Information System (8) collect passive national
surveillance data for a wide range of diseases
reported by physicians and laboratories. The
Gulf Coast States Vibrio Surveillance System
collects reports of Vibrio infections from selected
states (9), and the Foodborne Disease Outbreak
Surveillance System receives data from all states
on recognized foodborne illness outbreaks
(defined as two or more cases of a similar illness
resulting from ingestion of a common food) (10).
As components of the National Health Care
Survey, the National Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey measure health care use in
various clinical settings, including physician
offices and hospital emergency and outpatient
departments (11-14). These surveys collect
information on patient characteristics, patient
symptoms or reasons for visit, provider diagnosis,
and whether the patient was hospitalized. Up to
three symptoms are recorded using a standard
classification (17), and up to three provider
diagnoses are recorded according to the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision,
Clinical Modifications (ICD-9-CM,18) (Table 1).
The National Hospital Discharge Survey,
another component of the National Health Care
Survey, is a representative annual sample of
discharge records from approximately 475
nonfederal short-stay hospitals (15). The
information collected includes up to seven
principal discharge diagnoses classified by ICD-
9-CM codes (18). Because these data include
information on condition at discharge, they can
be used as a source of information on in-hospital
deaths. Additional information on food-related
deaths was obtained from the National Vital
Statistics System, which collects death certifi-
cate data on causes of death classified by 3- or 4-
digit ICD-9 codes (16).
In addition to information from these formal
surveillance systems, we used data from two
published population-based studies. The
Tecumseh study was conducted from 1965
through 1971 in 850 households in Tecumseh,
Michigan, with an emphasis on households with
young children (19). Households were tele-
phoned weekly to identify incident cases of self-
defined diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, or stomach
upset. The Cleveland study was conducted
among a selected group of 86 families followed
from 1948 through 1957 (20). A family member
609

recorded occurrences of gastrointestinal ill-
nesses and associated symptoms on a monthly
tally sheet. Both studies also collected informa-
tion on extraintestinal illnesses (e.g., respiratory
illness). Other studies with similar designs were
not included in our analysis, either because they
were relatively small or because they did not
provide information on the desired endpoints.
The Study
Food-Related Illness and Death from Known
Pathogens
Total Cases
To estimate the total number of foodborne
illnesses caused by known pathogens, we
determined the number of reported cases for
each pathogen, adjusted the figures to account
for underreporting, and estimated the propor-
tion of illnesses specifically attributable to
foodborne transmission. Although data from
various periods were used, adjustments for
changes in population size had minimal effect on
the final estimates and were therefore omitted.
Cases may be reported in association with
documented foodborne outbreaks, through
passive surveillance systems (e.g., the National
Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, the
Public Health Laboratory Information System),
or through active surveillance systems (e.g.,
FoodNet). Sporadic illness caused by some
pathogens (e.g., Bacillus cereus, Clostridium
perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus) is not
reportable through passive or active systems;
hence, the only cases reported are those related
to outbreaks. For these pathogens, we have
assumed that if diagnosed sporadic cases were
reported, the total number would be 10 times the
number of outbreak-related cases. This multi-
plier is based on experience with pathogens for
which data are available on both sporadic and
outbreak-associated cases (e.g., reported cases of
Salmonella or Shigella, Table 2). For all
pathogens, the number of outbreak-related cases
was calculated as the average annual number of
such cases reported to CDC from 1983 to 1992,
the most recent years for which published
outbreak data are available. For pathogens also
under passive surveillance, we used the average
number of cases reported to CDC from 1992
through 1997, and for pathogens under active
surveillance through FoodNet, we used the
average rate observed for the surveillance
population from 1996 to 1997 and applied this to
the total 1997 U.S. population (with some
modification for E. coli O157:H7; Appendix).
Irrespective of the surveillance system,
many cases of foodborne illness are not reported
because the ill person does not seek medical care,
the health-care provider does not obtain a
specimen for diagnosis, the laboratory does not
perform the necessary diagnostic test, or the
illness or laboratory findings are not communi-
cated to public health officials. Therefore, to
calculate the total number of illnesses caused by
each pathogen, it is necessary to account for
underreporting, i.e., the difference between the
number of reported cases and the number of
cases that actually occur in the community. For
Salmonella, a pathogen that typically causes
nonbloody diarrhea, the degree of underreporting
has been estimated at ~38 fold (Voetsch,
manuscript in preparation) (21). For E. coli
O157:H7, a pathogen that typically causes
bloody diarrhea, the degree of underreporting
has been estimated at ~20 fold (22). Because
similar information is not available for most
other pathogens, we used a factor of 38 for
pathogens that cause primarily nonbloody
diarrhea (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter) and
20 for pathogens that cause bloody diarrhea (e.g.,
E. coli O157:H7, Shigella). For pathogens that
typically cause severe illness (i.e., Clostridium
botulinum, Listeria monocytogenes), we arbi-
trarily used a far lower multiplier of 2, on the
assumption that most cases come to medical
attention. Details of the calculations for each
specific pathogen and rationale are provided in
the Appendix. Where information from both
active and passive reporting was available, we
used the figure from active surveillance when
estimating the total number of cases.
Having estimated the number of cases caused
by each pathogen, the final step was to estimate
for each the percentage of illness attributable to
foodborne transmission. The total number of
cases was then multiplied by this percentage to
derive the total number of illnesses attributable
to foodborne transmission. The rationale for each
estimate is presented in the Appendix; although
precise percentages are generally difficult to
justify, in most instances there is ample support
for the approximate value used.
Results are presented in Tables 2 and 3.

(13%) due to bacteria, 2.5 million (7%) due to

accounts for 13.8 million of the 38.6 million
illnesses (Table 3). Excluding illness caused by
Listeria, Toxoplasma, and hepatitis A virus (three
pathogens that typically cause nongastrointestinal
illness), 38.3 million cases of acute gastroenteri-

multiplying the number of reported cases by
pathogen-specific hospitalization rates from
FoodNet data (23, 24), reported outbreaks (10,
25), or other published studies (Appendix). Not
all illnesses resulting in hospitalization are
diagnosed or reported. Health-care providers
may not order the necessary diagnostic tests,
patients may have already taken antibiotics that
interfere with diagnostic testing, or the condition
leading to hospitalization may be a sequela that
develops well after resolution of the actual
infection (e.g., Campylobacter-associated
Guillain-Barré syndrome). Therefore, to account
for underreporting, we doubled the number of
hospitalizations among reported cases to derive
for each pathogen an estimate of the total
number of hospitalizations. Finally, we multiplied
this figure by the proportion of infections
attributable to foodborne transmission. Because
of gaps in the available data, this approach
could not be used for some parasitic and viral
diseases (Appendix).
Overall, the pathogens listed in Table 2 cause
an estimated 181,177 hospitalizations each year,
of which 60,854 are attributable to foodborne
transmission (Table 3). Excluding hospitaliza-
tions for infection with Listeria, Toxoplasma,
and hepatitis A virus, 163,015 hospitalizations
for acute gastroenteritis are caused by known
pathogens, of which 55,512 (34%) are attribut-
able to foodborne transmission. Overall, bacte-
rial pathogens account for 60% of hospitaliza-
tions attributable to foodborne transmission,
parasites for 5%, and viruses for 34%.

Deaths
Like illnesses and hospitalizations, deaths
are also underreported. Precise information on
food-related deaths is especially difficult to
obtain because pathogen-specific surveillance
systems rarely collect information on illness
outcome, and outcome-specific surveillance
systems (e.g., death certificates) grossly under-
report many pathogen-specific conditions. To
estimate the number of deaths due to bacterial
pathogens, we used the same approach described
for hospitalizations: first calculating the number
of deaths among reported cases, then doubling
this figure to account for unreported deaths, and
finally multiplying by the percentage of
infections attributable to foodborne transmis-
sion. As with hospitalization, this approach could
not be used for some parasitic and viral diseases.
Overall, the specified pathogens cause an
estimated 2,718 deaths each year, of which 1,809
are attributable to foodborne transmission
(Table 3). Excluding death due to Listeria,
Toxoplasma, and hepatitis A virus, the number
of deaths due to pathogens that cause acute
gastroenteritis is 1,381, of which 931 (67%) are
attributable to foodborne transmission. Bacteria
account for 72% of deaths associated with
foodborne transmission, parasites for 21%, and
viruses for 7%. Five pathogens account for over
90% of estimated food-related deaths: Salmo-
nella (31%), Listeria (28%), Toxoplasma (21%),
Norwalk-like viruses (7%), Campylobacter (5%),
and E. coli O157:H7 (3%).
Food-Related Illness and Death from
Unknown Pathogens
Some proportion of gastrointestinal illness is
caused by foodborne agents not yet identified.
This conclusion is supported by well-documented
foodborne outbreaks of distinctive illness for
which the causative agent remains unknown
(e.g., Brainerd diarrhea) (26), by the large
percentage of foodborne outbreaks reported to
CDC for which no pathogen is identified (25), and
by the large number of new foodborne pathogens
identified in recent years.
To estimate food-related illness and death
from unknown pathogens, we used symptom-
based data to estimate the total number of acute
gastrointestinal illnesses and then subtracted
from this total the number of cases accounted for
by known pathogens; this difference represents
the illness due to acute gastroenteritis of
unknown etiology. To determine how much of
this illness was due to foodborne transmission,
we used the percentages of foodborne transmis-
sion as determined above for acute gastroenteri-
tis caused by known pathogens.
Total Cases
To determine the rate of acute gastroenteri-
tis in the general population, we used data on the
frequency of diarrhea from the 1996 to 1997
FoodNet population survey. This survey did not
collect data on the rate of vomiting among
persons without diarrhea, however, so we relied
on the Tecumseh and Cleveland studies for
information on the frequency of this symptom.
Because young children were overrepresented in
the Tecumseh and Cleveland studies relative to
the current U.S. population, rates of illness for
these studies were age-adjusted. For the
Tecumseh data, we used the reported age- and
symptom-specific rates. For the Cleveland study,
we used the method described by Garthright (27)
to derive an overall age-adjusted rate of
gastrointestinal illness; we then multiplied this
rate by the relative frequency of symptoms to
derive age-adjusted rates for specific symptoms.
In the 1996-97 FoodNet population survey,
the overall rate of diarrhea was 1.4 episodes per
person per year, and the rate of diarrheal illness,
defined as diarrhea (3 loose stools per 24-hour
period) lasting >1 day or interfering with normal
activities, was 0.75 episodes per person per year
(H. Herikstad, manuscript in preparation). We
used the lower 0.75 rate for our analysis. To this
we added the average age-adjusted rate of
vomiting without diarrhea from the Tecumseh
and Cleveland studies (0.30, Table 4) to derive an
overall estimate of 1.05 episodes per person per
year of acute gastrointestinal illness character-
ized by diarrhea, vomiting, or both.
Previous studies have shown that some cases
of acute gastrointestinal illness are accompanied
by respiratory symptoms; although the causes of
these illnesses are generally unknown, such
cases have traditionally been attributed to
respiratory pathogens (20,27). Data on the
frequency of concomitant respiratory symptoms
were not collected in the 1996-97 FoodNet survey
but were 20% to 27% among patients with acute
gastroenteritis in the Tecumseh and Cleveland
studies. Therefore, we adjusted downward our
estimate of acute gastroenteritis by 25%,
yielding a final estimate of 0.79 (1.05 X 0.75)

episodes of acute gastroenteritis per person per
year. Extrapolated to a population of 267.7
million persons, the U.S. resident population in
1997 (28), this rate is equivalent to 211 million
episodes each year in the United States.
As determined previously, 38.3 million of
these 211 million episodes of acute gastroenteri-
tis are attributable to known pathogens. A small
proportion of the remaining 173 million episodes
can be accounted for by known, noninfectious
agents (e.g., mycotoxins, marine biotoxins);
however, most are attributable to unknown
agents. Because we cannot directly ascertain
how many of these illnesses of unknown etiology
are due to foodborne transmission, we used the
relative frequency of foodborne transmission for
known pathogens as a guide. For illnesses of
known etiology, foodborne transmission ac-
counts for 36% of total cases. Applying this
percentage yields an estimate of 62 million
cases of acute gastroenteritis of unknown
etiology (36% of 173 million) due to foodborne
transmission each year.
Hospitalizations
The National Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey/the National Hospital Ambulatory Medi-
cal Care Survey data were searched for visits due
to symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, or gas-
trointestinal infection (reason for visit classifica-
tion {RVC} codes 1595, 1530, 1540) (17) and for
visits resulting in a diagnosis of infectious
enteritis (ICD-9-CM codes 001-009.3; Table 1).
Visits associated with respiratory symptoms
(RVC codes 1400-1499) or a diagnosis of
influenza (ICD-9-CM code 487) were excluded.
Data for the years 1992 to 1996 were combined
before analysis. Overall, these criteria yielded an
average of 15,810,905 visits annually from 1992
through 1996, of which an average of 1,246,763,
or 7.9%, resulted in hospitalization. This figure is
equivalent to a rate of 4.7 hospitalizations per
1,000 person-years.
The National Hospital Discharge Survey
data were searched by using diagnostic codes for
infectious gastroenteritis of known cause (ICD-
9-CM codes 001-008; Table 1), with the exception
of the code for Clostridium difficile colitis (ICD9
008.45), a common form of nosocomially acquired
diarrhea. In addition, we included the nonspe-
cific ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes 009 (infectious
gastroenteritis) and 558.9 (other and unspecified
noninfectious gastroenteritis and colitis). De-
spite the description, many of the illnesses
attributed to ICD-9-CM code 558.9 are likely to
be either infectious or due to agents possibly
transmitted by food. For example, in the absence
of laboratory testing, sporadic cases of viral
gastroenteritis may be coded as 558.9. Under the
previous ICD-8 classification, these same cases
would have been assumed to be infectious and
coded as 009 (29, 30). Data for the years 1992 to
1996 were weighted according to National
Center for Health Statistics criteria and
averaged to derive national estimates of annual
hospitalizations. Records with a diagnosis of
respiratory illness were not excluded because of
the high incidence of respiratory infections
among hospitalized patients.
Considering all listed diagnoses, the Na-
tional Hospital Discharge Survey data for the
years 1992 to 1996 yielded an annual average of
616,337 hospital discharges with a diagnosis of
gastrointestinal illness. Included in this figure
are 193,084 cases of gastroenteritis with an
identified pathogen and an additional 423,293
cases of gastroenteritis of unknown etiology
(Table 5). Converted to a rate, the total number is
equivalent to 2.3 hospitalizations per 1,000
person-years. Because these data depend on the
recording of a diagnosis and not just a symptom,
it is likely that they underestimate the rate of
hospitalization for acute gastroenteritis. This
view is supported by FoodNet population survey
data indicating a rate of approximately 7.2
hospitalizations per 1,000 person-years for
614
Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 5, No. 5, SeptemberOctober 1999
Synopses
diarrheal illness (H. Herikstad, manuscript in
preparation). These data were not included here
because they omit hospitalizations for vomiting
alone and are not easily adjusted for concomitant
respiratory symptoms. Averaging the rates from
the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey/
National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey and National Hospital Discharge Survey
yields a final estimate of 3.5 hospitalizations per
1,000 person-years, equivalent to 936,726
hospitalizations annually for acute gastroenteri-
tis. As noted previously, 163,153 of these
hospitalizations can be attributed to known
causes of acute gastroenteritis, yielding an
estimated 773,573 hospitalizations for acute
gastroenteritis caused by unknown agents.
Applying the relative frequency of foodborne
transmission as determined for known patho-
gens yields an estimated 263,015 hospitaliza-
tions (34% of 773,573) for acute gastroenteritis
due to foodborne transmission of unknown agents.
Deaths
Multiple-cause-of-death data (16) and infor-
mation on in-hospital-death data (National
Hospital Discharge Survey) were used. ICD-9-CM
codes 001-008 were employed to identify deaths
due to diagnosed infectious gastroenteritis and
ICD-9-CM codes 009 and 558 to identify deaths
due to gastroenteritis of unknown etiology.
Death certificate data for the years 1992 to
1996 yielded an annual average of 6,195 total
deaths, of which 1,432 (23%) were due to specific
causes of gastroenteritis and 4,763 (77%) to
undiagnosed causes of gastroenteritis. For the
same years and ICD-9-CM codes, the average
annual in-hospital deaths for all-listed diagnoses
totaled 6,608, of which 1,460 were due to specific
and 5,148 (77%) undiagnosed causes of
gastroenteritis (Table 5). Averaging the totals for
all causes from death certificate and National
Hospital Discharge Survey data and adjusting to
the 1997 U.S. census estimates, we estimated
that gastroenteritis contributed to the death of
6,402 persons in the United States in 1997.
A total of 1,386 of these deaths can be
explained by known causes of acute gastroenteri-
tis (see above). Thus an estimated 5,016 deaths
from acute gastroenteritis are caused by unknown
agents. Applying the relative frequency of
foodborne transmission as determined for known
pathogens yields an estimated 3,360 deaths (67%
of 5,016) due to acute gastroenteritis caused by
foodborne transmission of unknown agents.
Overall Food-Related Illness and Death
We summed illness attributable to foodborne
gastroenteritis caused by known and unknown
pathogens, yielding an estimate of 76 million
illnesses, 318,574 hospitalizations, and 4,316
deaths. Adding to these figures the nongastrointes-
tinal illness caused by Listeria, Toxoplasma, and
hepatitis A virus, we arrived at a final national
estimate of 76 million illnesses, 323,914 hospital-
izations, and 5,194 deaths each year (Figure 1).
Conclusions
The nature of food and foodborne illness has
changed dramatically in the United States over
the last century. While technological advances
such as pasteurization and proper canning have
all but eliminated some disease, new causes of
foodborne illness have been identified. Research-
ers have used various methods to estimate the
illnesses and deaths due to foodborne diseases in
the United States. In 1985, Archer and Kvenberg
coupled information on underreporting of
salmonellosis with data on other foodborne
pathogens to derive estimates of 8.9 million
illnesses due to known pathogens and 24 million
to 81 million illnesses due to all foodborne agents
(2). In 1987, Bennett et al. computed incidence

figures for all known infectious diseases and
determined the proportion of each due to various
modes of transmission. Summing these figures,
they concluded that foodborne transmission of
known pathogens caused 6.5 million illnesses
and up to 9,000 deaths each year (3). In 1989,
Todd used a combination of methods, including
extrapolation from Canadian surveillance data,
to derive an estimate of 12.5 million foodborne
illnesses and 522 related deaths each year (4).
Finally, in 1994, a task force convened by the
Council for Agricultural Science and Technology
(CAST) reviewed available studies and esti-
mated the overall number of food-related
illnesses at 33 million cases per year (5). These
various estimates often refer to different entities.
The estimates of 6.5 million and 8.9 million refer
to illness caused by known pathogens, whereas
the estimate of 33 million refers to all causes of
foodborne illnesses, known and unknown,
infectious and noninfectious.
Our estimates are based on data from a wide
variety of sources and differ from previous
estimates in several respects. For known
pathogens, our estimate of 13.8 million illnesses
per year is substantially higher than the
previous estimates of 6.5 million and 8.9 million
(2, 3), an increase attributable largely to our
inclusion of foodborne illness caused by
Norwalk-like viruses. For foodborne illness of all
etiologies, our estimate of 76 million illnesses is
within the range proposed by Archer and
Kvenberg (2) but considerably higher than the
point estimate of 33 million presented in the
CAST report (5). Both our estimate and the
CAST estimate assume that foodborne transmis-
sion accounts for ~35% of acute gastroenteritis
cases caused by unknown agents. The disparity
between the two stems from differences in the
estimated annual frequency of acute gastroen-
teritis overall: 211 million cases for our estimate,
99 million for the CAST estimate.
Whereas our estimates of illness are
generally higher than those of previous studies,
our estimates of death are generally lower. We
estimate that foodborne illness causes 5,020
616
Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 5, No. 5, SeptemberOctober 1999
Synopses
deaths annually (1,810 deaths due to known
pathogens and 3,210 deaths due to unknown
agents), a total that is slightly more than half the
9,000 deaths estimated by Bennett et al. (3). The
Bennett estimate includes 2,100 deaths due to
campylobacteriosis, 1,200 deaths due to staphy-
lococcal food poisoning, and 1,000 deaths due to
trichinosis: our total for all three of these
diseases is 101 deaths. Our estimated case-
fatality rates for several other diseases are also
lower than those used in the Bennett report,
either because better data are available or
perhaps because treatment has improved.
Our analysis suggests that unknown agents
account for approximately 81% of foodborne
illnesses and hospitalizations and 64% of deaths.
Among cases of foodborne illness due to known
agents, Norwalk-like viruses account for over
67% of all cases, 33% of hospitalizations, and 7%
of deaths. The assumptions underlying the
Norwalk-like viruses figures are among the most
difficult to verify, and these percentages should
be interpreted with caution (Appendix). Other
important causes of severe illness are Salmo-
nella and Campylobacter, accounting for 26%
and 17% of hospitalizations, respectively. The
leading causes of death are Salmonella, Listeria,
and Toxoplasma, which together account for
1,427, or more than 75% of foodborne deaths
caused by known pathogens. Many of the deaths
due to toxoplasmosis occur in HIV-infected
patients; recent advances in HIV treatment may
greatly reduce deaths due to toxoplasmosis.
Of necessity, our analysis entails a number of
assumptions. The first major assumption
concerns the degree of underreporting. Well-
documented estimates of underreporting are not
available for most pathogens; therefore, we
relied on multipliers derived for salmonellosis
and other diseases. For salmonellosis, the
multiplier of 38 has been independently derived
by investigators in the United States using
different data sources. The U.S. figure is five to
tenfold higher than multipliers for Salmonella
and Campylobacter recently derived in Great
Britain (31). However, this difference is nearly or
wholly offset by far higher per capita rates of
reported infections in Great Britain. Neverthe-
less, when extrapolated to other pathogens,
these multipliers may result in under- or
overestimates, and clearly studies such as those
conducted for Salmonella are needed to develop
better multipliers for these other diseases.
However, in our analysis, changing the
multipliers for individual diseases has a minimal
effect on the overall estimate of foodborne illness.
Our second set of assumptions concerns the
frequency of foodborne transmission for indi-
vidual pathogens. We have used published
studies when available, but these are rare. As
with underreporting multipliers, errors affect
estimates for individual pathogens but have
minimal effect on the estimate of overall illness
and death from foodborne diseases. The one
notable exception is the estimate for Norwalk-
like viruses. Because these viruses account for
an especially large number of illnesses, changes
in the percentage attributed to foodborne
transmission have a major effect on our overall
estimates. For example, if the actual number of
infections due to foodborne transmission were
30% rather than 40%, the overall estimate would
decrease from 76 million to 63 million illnesses
per year. Interestingly, our overall estimate is
influenced far less by the Norwalk-like virus case
estimate itself. It would require a 100-fold
reduction in the estimated number of Norwalk-
like virus cases to reduce the overall estimate
from 76 million to 63 million.
A third assumption concerns the frequency
of acute gastroenteritis in the general popula-
tion. The rate we used is based in part on recent
data from the FoodNet population survey, a
retrospective survey involving more than 9,000
households. The overall rate of diarrhea as
recorded by the survey was 1.4 episodes per
person per year; however, we used the surveys
far lower rate of 0.75 episodes of diarrheal illness
per person per year. Furthermore, we limited
our definition of acute gastroenteritis to
symptoms of diarrhea or vomiting and reduced
the rate to account for concomitant respiratory
symptoms. As a result, our final assumed rate of
0.79 episodes of acute gastroenteritis per person
per year is very similar to respiratory-adjusted
estimates derived from the prospectively
conducted Tecumseh (0.74) and Cleveland (0.71)
studies (27). All three studies are based on
household surveys, and thus the rates of illness
are not influenced by changes in health-care
delivery. Compared with rates of diarrheal
illness from studies conducted in Great Britain,
our estimated rate is higher than in one recent
study (31) but lower than another (32).
In addition to these assumptions, our
analysis has several limitations. Differences in
617
Vol. 5, No. 5, SeptemberOctober 1999 Emerging Infectious Diseases
Synopses
available surveillance information prevented us
from using the same method to estimate illness
and death from bacterial, parasitic, and viral
pathogens. Furthermore, because of a paucity of
surveillance information, we did not include
specific estimates for some known, occasionally
foodborne pathogens (e.g., Plesiomonas,
Aeromonas, or Edwardsiella), nor did we develop
specific estimates for known noninfectious
agents, such as mushroom or marine biotoxins,
metals, and other inorganic toxins. However,
many of these agents cause gastroenteritis and
are therefore captured in our overall estimate of
foodborne illness. With the exception of a few
important pathogens (Appendix), we have not
estimated the number of cases of chronic
sequelae, although these may be part of the
overall burden of foodborne diseases. Finally,
future research will refine our assumptions and
allow for more precise estimates.
Methodologic differences between our analy-
sis and previously published studies make it
difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding
overall trends in the incidence of foodborne
illness. In general, the differences between our
estimates and previously published figures
appear to be due primarily to the availability of
better information and new analyses rather than
real changes in disease frequency over time. For
example, E. coli O157:H7 was estimated to cause
10,000 to 20,000 illnesses annually, based on
studies of patients visiting a physician for
diarrhea. Recent FoodNet data have allowed a
more detailed estimation of mild illnesses not
resulting in physician consultation. Our esti-
mate of nearly 74,000 illnesses per year
incorporates these milder illnesses and should
not be misconstrued as demonstrating a recent
increase in E. coli O157:H7 infections. Whatever
the limitations on retrospective comparisons, the
estimates presented here provide a more reliable
benchmark with which to judge the effectiveness
of ongoing and future prevention efforts.
Further refinements of foodborne disease
estimates will require continued and improved
active surveillance. Beginning in 1998, the
FoodNet population survey was modified to
capture cases of vomiting not associated with
diarrhea; further enhancement to capture
concomitant respiratory symptoms should refine
the FoodNet survey data. Expansion of
laboratory diagnostic capacity could lead to
better detection of certain pathogens, estimates
of the degree of underreporting for additional
diseases, and estimates of the proportion of
specific diseases transmitted through food.
Heightened surveillance for acute, noninfectious
foodborne diseases, such as mushroom poisoning
and other illnesses caused by biotoxins, could
further improve estimates of illness and death
from foodborne illness. Emergency department-
based surveillance systems (33) or poison control
center-based surveillance might provide such
information. Finally, identifying new causes of
enteric illness and defining the public health
importance of known agents (e.g., enteroaggre-
gative E. coli) would improve foodborne disease
prevention efforts.

Bacterial Pathogens
Pathogen: Bacillus cereus
Reported cases: Cases not routinely reported. Because it is
a mild illness, reported cases assumed to be 10 times the
average annual number of outbreak-related cases reported to
CDC, 1983-1992 (10,25).
Total cases: Assumed to be 38 times the number of reported
cases by extrapolation from studies of salmonellosis.
Hospitalization rate: Determined from outbreaks reported
to CDC, 1982-1992 (10,25) and (CDC, unpub. data).
Case-fatality rates: Determined from outbreaks reported to
CDC, 1982-1992 (10,25), including those associated with
nursing homes (34).
Percent foodborne: Although infection occasionally occurs
through other routes, case estimates presented are based on
foodborne outbreaks and are therefore assumed to reflect
only foodborne transmission.
Pathogen: Clostridium botulinum
Reported cases: Average annual number of cases of
foodborne botulism reported to CDC, 1992-1997 (7).
Total cases: Because it is a severe illness, assumed to be two
times the number of reported cases.
Hospitalization rate: Determined from outbreaks reported
to CDC, 1982-1992 (10,25) and (CDC, unpub. data).
Case-fatality rate: Based on outbreaks reported to CDC,
1982-1992 (10,25).
Percent foodborne: 100% by definition.
Pathogen: Brucella spp.
Reported cases: Average annual number of cases reported
to CDC, 1992-1997 (7).
Total cases: Assumed to be 14 times reported cases, based on
published estimates that 4% to 10% of cases are reported (35).
Hospitalization rate: Determined from outbreaks reported
to CDC, 1982-1992 (10,25) and (CDC, unpub. data).
Case-fatality rate: Historically 2% to 5% (36).
Percent foodborne: Overall, consumption of milk or cheese
products from Mexico implicated in 45% of cases reported
from California from 1973 to 1992 (37). Because the
proportion of cases due to foodborne transmission was higher
618
Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 5, No. 5, SeptemberOctober 1999
Synopses
in the latter half of this period, we assumed that currently
50% of cases are foodborne.
Comments: Reports from California or Texas account for
most of cases in recent years.
Pathogen: Campylobacter spp.
Reported cases: Outbreak-related cases based on reports to
CDC, 1983-1992 (10,25). Passive surveillance estimate based
on average number of cases reported to CDC, 1992-1994
(CDC, unpub. data). Active surveillance estimate based on
extrapolation of average 1996-1997 FoodNet rate (24.1 cases
per 100,000 population) to 1997 U.S. population (23).
Total cases: Assumed to be 38 times the number of reported
cases, based on studies of salmonellosis. Resulting estimate is
roughly comparable with midpoint rate estimate from Tauxe
(38) for C. jejuni (1,020 cases per 100,000 population), applied
to 1997 population. Assumes minimal contribution from non-
jejuni Campylobacter.
Hospitalization rate: Based on hospitalization rate for
culture-confirmed cases reported to FoodNet, 1996-1997
(23,24).
Case-fatality rate: Based on case-fatality rate for culture-
confirmed cases reported to FoodNet, 1996-1997 (23,24).
Percent foodborne: Although waterborne outbreaks occur,
foodborne transmission accounts for most of the sporadic
cases (38).
Comments: Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute
flaccid paralysis that can occur several weeks after infection
with various agents, including Campylobacter. The incidence
of GBS has been estimated at 1.7 cases per 100,000
population, and serologic studies suggest that ~30% of
patients with GBS have evidence of recent infection with
Campylobacter (39). Based on these figures, we estimate that
~1,360 cases of Campylobacter-associated GBS occurred in
the United States in 1997.
Pathogen: Clostridium perfringens
Reported cases: Cases not routinely reported. Because it is
a mild illness, number of reported cases assumed to be 10
times the average annual number of outbreak-related cases
reported to CDC, 1983-1992 (10,25).
Total cases: Assumed to be 38 times the number of reported
cases, by extrapolation from studies of salmonellosis.
Hospitalization rate: Determined from outbreaks reported
to CDC, 1982-1992 (10,25) and (CDC, unpub. data).
Case-fatality rate: Based on reported outbreaks, 1983-1992
(10,25).
Percent foodborne: 100% (40). Case estimates presented
are based on foodborne outbreaks and therefore reflect
foodborne transmission of C. perfringens, type A.
Pathogen: Escherichia coli O157:H7
Reported cases: Passive surveillance estimate based on
average number of cases reported to CDC through the
National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveil-
lance (NETSS), 1995-1998; data from the Public Health
Laboratory Information System (PHLIS) were used for those
states not reporting to NETSS during this time period (7).
Passive surveillance data for 1998 are provisional. Active
surveillance estimate based on an extrapolation of a weighted
average of the FoodNet rate for the years 1996-1997 to the
1997 U.S. population (23,24). A weighted average was used
because the overall FoodNet rate is disproportionately
influenced by a high rate in a single northern state with a
relatively small population. Because the incidence of
infection is thought to be generally higher in northern states
(41), we weighted the crude rate derived from FoodNet by the
total population of each participating state. The weighted
rate (1.34 cases per 100,000 population) was used when
extrapolating the FoodNet rate to the total U.S. population.
Total cases: Studies conducted in FoodNet sites suggest that
13-27 cases of E. coli O157:H7 infection occur in the
community for each confirmed case that is reported (22). To
estimate total cases, we multiplied the number of reported
cases, as determined through active surveillance, by 20, the
midpoint of this estimate.
Hospitalization rate: Based on the hospitalization rate for
culture-confirmed cases reported to FoodNet, 1996-1997
(23,24).
Case-fatality rate: Case-fatality rate based on mortality
associated with sporadic cases reported to FoodNet, 1996-
1997 (23,24).
Percent foodborne: Based on outbreaks of known source
reported to CDC, 1982-1997 (CDC, unpub. data). Person-to-
person transmission assumed to be secondary to foodborne
transmission (2).
Comments: Our estimate of total cases is considerably
higher than previous estimates based on patients seeking
care for diarrhea. Our estimate includes patients with far
milder illness and should not be interpreted as indicating an
increase in incidence. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)
occurs in ~4% of all reported cases. Based on our estimate of
total cases and active surveillance cases, between 2,954 and
147 patients are expected to contract HUS each year.
Pathogen: E. coli, Shiga toxin-producing serogroups other
than O157 (STEC)
Reported cases: Cases not routinely reported; many clinical
laboratories cannot identify.
Total cases: Assumed to be half as common as infection with
E. coli O157:H7. Early studies suggest that the incidence of
non-O157 STEC infections is 20%-30% that of E. coli O157:H7
in North America (42, 43); however, more recent studies using
different techniques suggest that this figure should be 50%
(44,45).
Hospitalization rate: Assumed to be comparable with E.
coli O157:H7, but may be lower (46).
Case-fatality rate: Assumed to be comparable with E. coli
O157:H7, but may be lower (46).
Percent foodborne: Assumed to be comparable with E. coli
O157:H7.
Comment: Although non-O157 STEC can cause hemolytic
uremic syndrome, the relative frequency of this complication
is unknown. Reports from Canada suggest that non-O157
STEC are the cause of at least 7% (47) and possibly as many as
20% (48) of HUS cases.
Pathogen: E. coli, enterotoxigenic
Reported cases: Not routinely reported. Outbreak-related
cases based on average for 18 outbreaks reported to CDC
from 1975 through 1997 (CDC, unpub. data). Reported cases
assumed to be 10 times the number of outbreak-related cases.
Total cases: Assumed to be 38 times the number of reported
cases by extrapolation from studies of salmonellosis.
Hospitalization rate: Low; assumed to be 0.5% of cases.
Case-fatality rate: Serious illness is generally restricted to
infants in developing countries. Based on experience with
reported outbreaks, assumed to be 1 in 10,000 cases in the
United States.
Percent foodborne: Nearly all outbreaks reported to CDC
from 1975 through 1997 have been foodborne (CDC, unpub.
data); many sporadic cases are associated with travel to other
619
Vol. 5, No. 5, SeptemberOctober 1999 Emerging Infectious Diseases
Synopses
countries where both water and foodborne exposures are
likely.
Pathogen: E. coli, other diarrheogenic
Reported cases: Not routinely reported. Assumed to be at
least as common as enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) based on
limited information from studies in North America and
Europe (49).
Total cases: Assumed equal to ETEC.
Hospitalization rate: Assumed equal to ETEC.
Case-fatality rate: Assumed equal to ETEC.
Percent foodborne: Very little data available. As few
foodborne outbreaks have been reported, it is assumed that
only 30% of cases are foodborne.
Comment: This category includes enteropathogenic,
enteroaggregative, and enteroinvasive E. coli, as well as
poorly defined pathogenic groups (50). Although little is
known about the incidence of these infections in the United
States, these pathogens have been linked to both outbreaks
and sporadic illnesses. Limited studies suggest that the
importance of some of these organisms in the United States is
seriously underestimated (see Nataro and Kaper [49]).
Although clearly a heterogeneous collection of organisms, we
assume that these pathogens as a group have similar modes of
transmission and mortality rates as ETEC.
Pathogen: Listeria monocytogenes
Reported cases: Rates from FoodNet, 1996-1997, (23,24)
and comparable sentinel site surveillance (51), extrapolated
to the 1997 U.S. population.
Total cases: Because it is a severe illness, assumed to be 2
times the number of reported cases.
Hospitalization rate: Based on hospitalization rate for
culture-confirmed cases reported to FoodNet, 1996-1997
(23,24).
Case-fatality rate: Based on published reports (51), 1996-
1997 FoodNet data (23,24), and recent outbreaks (CDC,
unpub. data).
Percent foodborne: Although foodborne transmission
accounts for all reported domestic outbreaks (52), the
potential for nosocomial transmission has been demonstrated
(53).
Comments: Figures include both perinatal and nonperinatal
disease. FoodNet data on hospitalization indicate that nearly
90% of reported cases result in hospitalization (24).
Pathogen: Salmonella Typhi
Reported cases: Average number of cases reported to CDC,
1992-1997 (7).
Total cases: Because it is a severe illness, assumed to be two
times the number of reported cases.
Hospitalization rate: Rate of hospitalization based on
published outbreak reports (54,55).
Case-fatality rate: Based on outcomes of 2,254 cases
reviewed by Mermin (56).
Percent foodborne: Although waterborne outbreaks have
been reported in the United States, foodborne transmission is
believed to account for most cases (3).
Comments: Over 70% percent of reported cases are
associated with foreign travel (56).
A. Pathogen: Salmonella, nontyphoidal
B. Reported cases: Outbreak-related cases based on reports
to CDC, 1983-1992 (10,25). Passive surveillance estimate
based on average number of cases reported to CDC, 1992-
1997 (57). Active surveillance estimate based on extrapola-
tion of the average 1996-1997 FoodNet rate to the 1997 U.S.
population (23).
Total cases: Assumed to be 38 times the number of reported
cases based on FoodNet data (Voetsch, manuscript in
preparation) and the sequential surveillance artifact
multiplier derived by Chalker and Blaser (21).
Hospitalization rate: Based on hospitalization rate for
culture-confirmed cases reported to FoodNet, 1996-1997
(23,24).
Case-fatality rate: Average case-fatality rate among cases
reported to FoodNet, 1996-1997 (23,24). This rate is lower
than the previously published rate of 1.3% (58).
Percent foodborne: Although occasionally associated with
exposure to pets, reptiles, and contaminated water,
salmonellosis is primarily a foodborne disease (59).
Pathogen: Shigella spp.
Reported cases: Outbreak-related cases based on reports to
CDC, 1983-1992 (10,25). Passive surveillance estimate based
on average number of cases reported annually to CDC, 1992-
1997 (57). Active surveillance estimate based on extrapola-
tion of average 1996-1997 FoodNet rate to the 1997 U.S.
population (23).
Total cases: Because Shigella frequently causes bloody
diarrhea, total cases assumed to be 20 times the number of
reported cases, based on similarity to E. coli O157:H7.
Hospitalization rate: Based on hospitalization rate for
culture-confirmed cases reported to FoodNet, 1996-1997
(23,24).
Case-fatality rate: Average case-fatality rate among cases
reported to FoodNet, 1996-1997 (23,24).
Percent foodborne: Assumed to be 20%. Although most
cases are due to person-to-person transmission (60),
foodborne outbreaks are responsible for a substantial number
of cases (61).
Pathogen: Staphylococcus aureus (enterotoxin)
Reported cases: Not routinely reported. Assumed to be 10
times the number of foodborne outbreak-related cases
reported to CDC, 1983-1992 (10,25).
Total cases: Assumed to be 38 times the number of reported
cases, by extrapolation from studies of salmonellosis.
Hospitalization rate: Determined from outbreaks reported
to CDC, 1982-1992 (10,25), (CDC, unpub. data), and published
reports (62).
Case-fatality rate: Determined from reported outbreaks to
CDC, 1977-1992 (10,25,63).
Percent foodborne: 100% by definition. Case estimates
presented are based on foodborne outbreaks and therefore
reflect foodborne transmission.
Comment: The number of outbreak-associated cases of
staphylococcal food poisoning reported to CDC has decreased
substantially since 1973 (Bean and Griffin, 1990). This
decrease is unlikely to be an artifact of decreased recognition:
there has been no compensatory increase in the number of
foodborne outbreaks of unknown etiology with an incubation
period consistent with staphylococcal food poisoning (CDC,
unpub. data).
Pathogen: Streptococcus, Group A
Reported cases: Not routinely reported. Assumed to be 10
times the number of foodborne outbreak-related cases
reported to CDC, 1982-1992 (10,25).
Total cases: Assumed to be 38 times the number of reported
cases, by extrapolation from studies of salmonellosis.
Hospitalization rate: Determined from outbreaks reported

to CDC, 1982-1992 (10,25) and CDC, unpub. data.
Case-fatality rate: Determined from outbreaks reported to
CDC, 1982-1992 (10).
Percent foodborne: 100% foodborne by definition. Case
estimates presented are based on foodborne outbreaks and
therefore reflect foodborne transmission.
Pathogen: Vibrio cholerae, toxigenic O1 or O139
Reported cases: Based on cases reported to CDC, 1988-1997
(7).
Total cases: Assumed that the number of clinically significant
illnesses is two times the number of reported cases.
Hospitalization rate: Based on cases reported to CDC,
1992-1994 (64).
Case-fatality rate: Based on cases reported to CDC, 1992-
1994 (64).
Percent foodborne: Assumed to be primarily foodborne.
Most reported cases linked to foodborne outbreaks, and at
least 65% of sporadic cases may be foodborne (64).
Comments: 96% of cases acquired abroad (64).
Pathogen: Vibrio vulnificus
Reported cases: Cases reported to CDC from 22 states,
1988-1996 (65).
Total cases: Because it is a severe illness, assumed to be two
times the number of reported cases.
Hospitalization rate: Based on overall rate among cases
reported to CDC, 1988-1996 (65).
Case-fatality rate: Based on overall rate among cases
reported to CDC, 1988-1996; death rate higher among cases
due to foodborne transmission (65).
Percent foodborne: Based on Shapiro et al. (65).
Comment: Most cases are reported by Gulf States (Florida,
Alabama, Louisiana, Texas).
Pathogen: Vibrio, other spp.
Reported cases: Passive surveillance estimate based on
cases reported to CDC, 1988-1996 (CDC, unpub. data). Active
surveillance estimate based on 1996 FoodNet rate
extrapolated to the 1997 U.S. population (23). FoodNet data
from 1997 not included because of a large outbreak of Vibrio
parahaemolyticus infections that could falsely elevate the
overall rate.
Total cases: Because it is a moderately severe illness, total
cases assumed to equal 20 times the reported cases, a degree
of underreporting comparable with E. coli O157:H7
infections.
Hospitalization rate: Based on rate among non-vulnificus,
non-cholerae O1 cases reported by Hlady (66).
Case-fatality rate: Based on rate among non-vulnificus,
non-cholerae O1 cases reported by Hlady (66).
Percent foodborne: Based on history of shellfish
consumption for cases reported by Hlady (66).
Comment: Because of larger sample size, data from Hlady
(66) used in preference to FoodNet data for hospitalization
and death rates.
Pathogen: Yersinia enterocolitica
Reported cases: Active surveillance estimate based on
extrapolation of average 1996-1997 FoodNet rate to the 1997
U.S. population (23,24).
Total cases: Assumed to be 38 times the number of reported
cases, based on studies of salmonellosis.
Hospitalization rate: Based on the hospitalization rate for
culture-confirmed cases reported to FoodNet, 1996-1997
(23,24).
Case-fatality rate: Low, assumed to be 0.5% (23).
Percent foodborne: Assumed to be 90%. Nearly all reported
outbreaks in United States have been linked to contaminated
foods, and pork is specifically believed to be the source of most
infections (67).
Parasitic Pathogens
Pathogen: Cryptosporidium parvum
Reported cases: Passive surveillance estimate based on the
average annual number of cases reported to CDC, 1995-1997
(7). Active surveillance estimate based on extrapolation of the
average1997-98FoodNetratetothe1997U.S.population(6,24).
Total cases: Published studies suggest that ~2% of all stools
tested for Cryptosporidium are positive (68, 69). We assume
this rate of infection applies to all patients visiting a health-
care provider for acute gastroenteritis. Using an estimate of
~15 million physician visits for diarrhea each year (see text),
we estimate there are approximately 300,000 cases of
cryptosporidiosis per year. This figure is 45-fold higher than
the estimated number of reported cases based on FoodNet
active surveillance, a multiplier only slightly larger than the
one used for salmonellosis.
Hospitalization rate: Based on the hospitalization rate for
culture-confirmed cases reported to FoodNet, 1997-1998
(6,24).
Case-fatality rate: Average case-fatality rate among cases
reported to FoodNet, 1997-1998 (6,24).
Percent foodborne: Based on very limited information (70-
72), we assume that 10% of cases are attributable to foodborne
transmission, with the rest due to consumption of
contaminated water or person-to-person transmission.
Comment: Cryptosporidiosis in AIDS is associated with a
severe protracted course of diarrhea (73).
Pathogen: Cyclospora cayetanensis
Reported cases: Passive surveillance estimate based on
average annual number of cases reported to CDC, 1995-1997
(7). Active surveillance estimate based on extrapolation of
average 1997-1998 FoodNet rate to the 1997 U.S. population
(6,24).
Total cases: Assumed to be 38 times the number of reported
cases based on studies of salmonellosis.
Hospitalization rate: Based on the hospitalization rate for
culture-confirmed cases reported to FoodNet, 1997 (24).
Case-fatality rate: Very low (74,75). Assumed to be 0.05%,
comparable with Clostridium perfringens.
Percent foodborne: Assumed 90% foodborne, based on
recent reported outbreaks (74,75).
Pathogen: Giardia lamblia
Reported cases: Not routinely reported.
Total cases: Sensitive surveillance in two sites (Vermont
and Wisconsin) suggests a rate of 40 cases per 100,000
persons per year (76,77). In addition, an estimated 5% of all
cases are reported. Thus, approximately 100,000 cases will be
detected each year, representing 2,000,000 actual cases.
Hospitalization rate: An estimated 5,000 cases per year are
severe enough to require hospitalization.
Case-fatality rate: Exceedingly low. Assumed to be no more
than 10 deaths annually.
Percent foodborne: Assumed to be 10%. Recreational water
is probably the major source of transmission (76-78); however,
several foodborne outbreaks have been reported (79,80).
Pathogen: Toxoplasma gondii
Reported cases: Not routinely reported.
621
Vol. 5, No. 5, SeptemberOctober 1999 Emerging Infectious Diseases
Synopses
Total cases: Based on national serologic data collected
during the 1994 NHANES, approximately 40% of persons 60
years old are seropositive for toxoplasmosis (CDC, unpub.
data). Assuming equal rates of infection over time, at least
0.6% of the population experiences an acute infection each
year, representing approximately 1,500,000 infections per
year. Approximately 15% of infections are symptomatic.
Hospitalization rate: Varies widely according to host
immune status. Data from NHDS indicate that from 1992 to
1996, toxoplasmosis was the first listed diagnosis for
approximately 5,000 hospital discharges each year. We have
used this figure as a conservative estimate of the number of
actual hospitalizations.
Case-fatality rate: Varies widely according to host immune
status. Of the approximately 5,000 hospital discharges
annually for which toxoplasmosis is the first listed diagnosis,
approximately 750 involve a deceased patient. We have used
this figure as a conservative estimate of the number of actual
deaths.
Percent foodborne: Although the proportion associated
with eating contaminated food varies by geographic region,
we assume an overall average of 50%. Recent unpublished
data from Europe suggest that 60% of acute infections are
from contaminated food (Ruth Gilbert, pers. comm.).
Comment: Typically, infection with Toxoplasma gondii
produces an asymptomatic illness or a mild viral-like febrile
illness with lymphadenopathy. Acute diarrhea is not
commonly associated with acute infection. Estimates from
the Massachusetts Department of Health suggest that one
case of congenital toxoplasmosis occurs for every 10,000
births (81). Extrapolating to 4,000,000 live births in the
United States, an estimated 400 children are born with
congenital toxoplasmosis. Based on calculations by investiga-
tors from Stanford University, each year approximately 6,000
women who experience an acute infection during pregnancy
and who do not receive treatment give birth to a child with
congenital toxoplasmosis, which results in chronic sequelae
(82). During an outbreak of toxoplasmosis in British
Columbia, of an estimated 2,900-7,700 infections, 19 cases of
retinitis were reported. If there are at least 150,000
symptomatic cases annually, from 300 to 1,050 cases (0.2% to
0.7%, respectively) of ocular toxoplasmosis could occur. If
there are 300,000 cases, from 600 to 2,100 ocular cases could
occur. Thus, there could be from 300 to 2,100 ocular cases of
toxoplasmosis annually. An estimated 4,000 persons with
AIDS develop Toxoplasma encephalitis annually. In
summary,from(400+300+4,000)=4,700to(6,000+2,100+4,000)
= 12,100 persons develop chronic sequelae due to
toxoplasmosis each year.
Pathogen: Trichinella spiralis
Reported cases: Based on NETSS surveillance data,
approximately 40 cases are reported annually.
Total cases: Because it can be a severe illness, assumed to be
two times the number of reported cases.
Hospitalization rate: Based on outbreak-related cases
reported to CDC, 1982-1992 (10).
Case-fatality rate: Assumed to be 0.3% based on data from a
large series in Europe.
Percent foodborne: 100% (83)
Comment: Clinically, acute trichinosis may be asymptomatic
or may have acute gastrointestinal symptoms, followed by a
parenteral phase of fever and myalgias. In 10% to 20% of cases
neurologic or cardiac symptoms develop, many severe and
potentially leading to chronic illness.
Viral Pathogens
Pathogen: Rotavirus
Reported cases: Not routinely reported.
Total cases: Because every child has at least one
symptomatic infection (84-86), the number of cases is
assumed to equal the 1997 U.S. birth cohort (3.9 million).
Hospitalizations: 50,000 (87,88).
Case-fatality rate: Very low: 20 to 40 deaths per year (89).
Percent foodborne: probably very low (<1%) (90).
Pathogen: Astrovirus
Reported cases: Not routinely reported.
Total cases: Because every child has at least one
symptomatic infection, the number of cases is assumed to
equal the 1997 US birth cohort (3.9 million).
Hospitalizations: Assumed to equal 25% of number of
hospitalizations for rotavirus (= 12,500) (91).
Case-fatality rate: Very low (<10 deaths per year).
Percent foodborne: Probably very low (<1%) (91).
Pathogen: Norwalk-like viruses (NLV).
Reported cases: Not routinely reported.
Total cases: Very few data are available for assessing the
disease burden associated with Norwalk-like viruses, and
very few studies have been conducted using the most
sensitive diagnostics for NLVs. One community-based study
from the Netherlands found 17% of cases of acute
gastroenteritis were associated with Norwalk-like viruses,
compared with 6% of controls, using reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of NLVs
(92). An Australian study detected NLVs in 15% of
hospitalized patients using immune electron microscopy (93).
Studies have generally been conducted exclusively among
young children or used less sensitive detection methods
(electron microscopy); in these studies, NLVs have been
detected in ~1% to 5% of participants (94-98). However, a
recent study incorporating RT-PCR for viral detection among
children 2 months to 2 years of age found that 21% of cases of
acute gastroenteritis were associated with NLVs (99). Given
these data, we assume that 11% of all episodes of acute
primary gastroenteritis are due to NLVs (using the data from
the best of the studies) (92).
Hospitalizations: NLV assumed to account for 11% of
452,000 annual hospitalizations for viral gastroenteritis
(100).
Case-fatality rate: Low. NLV assumed to account for 11% of
an estimated 2,800 fatal cases of viral gastroenteritis each
year (100).
Percent foodborne: We assume that the proportion of all
NLV-associated illness that is foodborne is 40%. This
estimate is based on a recent report which found that 47% of
NLV-associated acute gastroenteritis outbreaks in the
United States in which the modes of transmission were
known were foodborne (101). Since we would assume that
foodborne-associated outbreaks might be more likley to be
reported than Norwalk-like virus-associated outbreaks with
other mechanisms of spread, the proportion was lowered to
40%. This estimate is in general agreement with other
reviews (102-104). No data are available to directly determine
the proportion of cases of NLV-associated disease attribut-
able to foodborne transmission.
Pathogen: Hepatitis A
Reported cases: Based on cases reported to CDC, 1992-1997
(7).
622
Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 5, No. 5, SeptemberOctober 1999
Synopses
Total cases: Assumed to be three times the number of
reported cases (105).
Hospitalizations: Thirteen percent; based on data from
CDC Sentinel Counties Studies (106);
Case-fatality rate: 0.3%; based on data from the viral
Hepatitis Surveillance Program and the CDC Sentinel
Counties Studies (105,107). Deaths calculated by applying
the case-fatality rate to reported cases.
Percent foodborne: Foodborne transmission accounts for
approximately 5% of outbreaks of known source (105). Note
that the source is not determined in approximately 50% of
hepatitis A outbreaks, and foodborne transmission could
account for a far higher percentage of cases.
