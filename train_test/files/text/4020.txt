Introduction
Data collection in hermeneutic phenomenology is a reflec-
tive process which aims to access the insights of participants
as they make sense of their lived experiences and situated-
ness (van Manen, 1990). Interviews consistent with achiev-
ing this aim have been variously described as in-depth
interviews (Creswell, 2012), unstructured interviews (Corbin
& Morse, 2003), active interviews (Holstein & Gubrium,
1995), or conversational interviews (McConnell-Henry,
James, Chapman, & Francis, 2010).
Effective interviewing is thought to be a data collection
method to broaden and deepen our professional knowledge
by mining the experiences of individuals to construct com-
posite understanding. However, interviewing peers is fraught
with complexity. Nurse to nurse interviews can involve the
spectrum of collegial relationships from close friend to
unknown fellow professionals (McDermid, Peters, Jackson,
& Daly, 2014). Within the wide range of relationships, a tan-
gle of emotions, exclusions, and assumptions may exist for
the participant group, and divulging these to a fellow nurse
could be confronting and challenging. Perception and skill
on the part of the researcher are essential to ensure that inter-
view conversations are conducted sensitively and the out-
comes from conversational interviews are maximized. This
article explores the complexity of this dynamic in the context
of a study of nurse family carers (NFCs) who were caring for
a relative with a chronic illness, and who were interviewed
by a fellow nurse. A framework of strategies to embed inter-
viewing technique within the methodological structure is
suggested, and discussion around the pitfalls to be avoided
when interviewing peers is provided.
Background
The dual role of the nurse who is a family carer may offer a
privileged vantage point to effectively appraise care provi-
sion (Rochford, 2004; Salmond, 2011), and accessing
insights from this group of nurses may well provide informa-
tion to modify and improve health care practice. The article
will reflect on the use of one-to-one peer interviews between
a nurse researcher and an NFC who has a family member
with a chronic illness to harvest rich thick descriptions of this
life experience (Creswell, 2012; Ryle, 1968).
A review of recent literature indicates there is minimal
information that relates to the lived experience of nurses who

Who, Where, and How of
Interviewing Peers: Implications
for a Phenomenological Study
Loretto Quinney1, Trudy Dwyer1, and Ysanne Chapman2
Abstract
Research within a phenomenological framework is aimed at understanding the lived experience of participants to capture the
essences of their combined stories to provide new insights and truths surrounding a particular phenomenon. Essential to this
process is the acquiring of data representative of the experience being researched. The art of unstructured interviews is to
acknowledge and value participants' stories as each participant traverses deeply personal experiences with the interviewer.
This article examines the impact of factors that influence the successful interviewing of peers and explores how ignoring the
foundational elements of "who, where, and how" may result in lean or even skewed data. Aimed at accessing the essence of
a phenomenon through conversational interviews, the authors offer an adaptable framework that considers the additional
elements of "space, language, role, and trust" which is aligned with the intent of phenomenological studies.

care for family members during illness. Within the limited
pool of research, discussion dominates around the experi-
ences of nurse family members (NFMs) caring for elderly
relatives or relatives who have a critical or terminal illness
(McClunie-Trust, 2010; Rochford, 2004; Salmond, 2011;
Ward-Griffin, 2004). However, there has been a dearth of
investigation of situations where a nurse has held prolonged
responsibility and management for the health needs of a
chronically ill family member. Previous studies used the
term nurse family member (NFM) as opposed to NFC, which
is the focus of this study. It is important to note that the
authors perceive a fundamental difference that separates the
NFM from the NFC. The NFM may fulfill a vital role for the
period of an acute illness or indeed a palliative illness but
have no previous or continuing responsibility to care for a
family member outside those circumstances. In contrast, the
NFC has a very different commitment and has a continuing
role during times of remission, relapse, and recovery. The
study uses the term NFC as being more representative of the
ongoing primary carer role assumed when a close relative
has a chronic illness.
Professional mores of conduct are deeply engrained
within nurses and indeed the nursing culture (Shaw &
Timmons, 2010). Succinct and objective language and emo-
tional constraint are hallmarks of the professional demeanor
of nurses, and these characteristics have evolved to address
the needs and expectations of the clinical environment.
However, these attributes can present as obstacles for the
interviewer to be able to access the participants' experiences
of their family carer role. Interviewing peers brings added
dimensions and complexities of pre-existing relationships
and power balances. More effective peer interviewing may
result from understanding the issues of personal interaction,
space and environment, and process. These issues have been
named the "Who, Where, and How" of interviewing and will
be explored by using a Heideggerian hermeneutic approach.
The Who
Interviewing involves interaction between two parties the
participant and the interviewer. In the context of this study
both are nurses. Nurse to nurse interviewing has implications
for both participant and researcher. The dynamics of this
interaction requires careful consideration and management
of selection, relationship, and implementation to protect par-
ticipant and interviewer and preserve the integrity of the
interview. A factor that differentiates phenomenology from
other research methods is that it does not necessarily seek to
critique findings within a gender-balanced group or a socially
homogeneous group but recognizes that it is the explanation
of participants' stories as they make sense of a life experi-
ence that is important (van Manen, 1990). Although it may
be necessary to set some guidelines to focus the research,
care should be taken not to narrow the selection criteria of
participants as this may constrict or simplify the research
phenomenon (Cohen, Kahn, & Steeves, 2000). Participants
who have shared the same life experience but have dissimilar
circumstances may have different insights, and the diversity
of these data can provide a broader platform to understand
the phenomenon (Polkinghorne, 2005). There are three non-
negotiable selection criteria when considering who will be
invited to join the participant group: that the participant has
actually lived the life event that is being researched (van
Manen, 1990), that they agree to share those experiences,
and that they are able to commit to the time demands of the
research.
The focus of Heideggerian phenomenology is to explore
our human way of Being-in-the-world and how we as humans
reflect and make sense of Being-in-the-world; Heidegger
refers to this as Dasein (Dreyfus, 1991; Heidegger, 1962).
"The answer to the question of the `who' of everyday Dasein
is to be obtained by analysing that kind of Being in which
Dasein maintains itself proximally and for the most part"
(Heidegger, 1962, p. 153). Working from Heidegger's words,
the crucial task for interviewing within a phenomenological
study is to determine the world that is being researched and
to interview the participant when they are in that world.
Specifying the exact life event that is to be studied can take
considerable time and thought, experienced researchers
advise that the development of criteria for purposive sam-
pling should be clearly identified (Faugier & Sargeant, 1996;
Streeton, Cooke, & Campbell, 2004).
To facilitate effective recruitment in our study, the partici-
pant group was composed of registered nurses, in recogni-
tion of their knowledge base and professional role in
planning, coordinating, and evaluating delivery of care. As
an indicator of recency, participants needed to have fulfilled
the NFC role in the previous 5 years. There was no expecta-
tion that participants resided with their family member, but
the lead researcher confirmed that the role of carer was a
constant and continuing responsibility. Finally, participants
were required to have held their role for a minimum period of
12 months, and this was set in order to capture the depth and
variation of experiences occurring and recurring in disease
processes that have cyclical or progressive courses. These
determinants were used to establish the participant group and
identify the everyday Dasein that was to become the focus of
the study.
Another key element of building a sound foundation for
data collection is using an effective recruitment strategy
(Sadler, Lee, Lim, & Fullerton, 2010; Streeton et al., 2004).
Recruitment of participants in this study was achieved
through the process of snowballing, a method that uses an
informal referral process between colleagues and friends to
connect interested parties to the research (Noy, 2008). One
rationale for using this strategy was that NFCs often elect to
have a low profile and can fulfill this role without disclosing
it to co-workers (Rochford, 2004; Sadler et al., 2010). As a
consequence, their role as a carer can be invisible to any but
close colleagues, and in such circumstances, snowballing
Quinney et al. 3
may be the only effective strategy to reach potential partici-
pants who fulfill the dual role of being both a professional
nurse and a family carer (Faugier & Sargeant, 1996; Noy,
2008; Sadler et al., 2010).
Nurse to nurse relationships can exist within a wide range
of associations from one of friendship to supervisor­junior
to unknown colleague (McConnell-Henry et al., 2010). Upon
hearing about the project, some colleagues, who were friends,
offered to participate in the project. There was an awareness
that the ethical recruitment process needed to address any
perception of pressure or coercion (McDermid et al., 2014).
Care was taken not to place any pressure or expectation on
colleagues to participate, and it was stressed that involve-
ment was voluntary, and an option to withdraw was made
available. Pre-existing relationships can lessen the time
taken to build rapport and enable the interview to move
quickly toward a shared dialogue of experiences (McConnell-
Henry et al., 2010). However, the levels of trust in an estab-
lished friendship or work relationship may result in the
participant revealing more than they had intended or provid-
ing information they may later regret (Kvale, 2006).
When interviewing participants from pre-existing relation-
ships or from a group that the researcher belongs to, the inter-
viewer has a status of being an insider (Corbin Dwyer &
Buckle, 2009; McConnell-Henry et al., 2010). All of the
interviews undertaken in this study had a level of commonal-
ity; some participants were colleagues and some participants
were previously unknown to the research team, but like the
interviewer, all participants shared the experience of being a
nurse and of being an NFC. In the nuances, pauses, and idi-
omatic sayings of the participants'everyday speech, a consid-
erable level of intent and meaning can be hidden (van Manen,
1990). Nursing has language that has particular acronyms and
speech patterns that represent the everyday communication
for the profession. Participants would easily slip into the lan-
guage of their everyday. The professional Dasein of the par-
ticipants and of the researcher was both nursing and of being
a family carer, and in that shared world, there was a connec-
tion or as Heidegger expressed it a "Being-there-too."
This Being-there-too (Auch-dasein) with them does not have the
ontological character of a Being-present-at-hand-along-"with"
them within a world. This "with" is something of the character
of "Dasein"; the "too" means a sameness of Being as
circumspectively concernful Being-in-the-world. (Heidegger,
1962, p. 154)
The connectedness of Auch-dasein cultivated a level of
trust that facilitated the interview process. Trust and rapport
are necessary to build the relationship between participant
and the interviewer to an immersion phase where there is a
deep level of participation (Di Ciccio-Bloom & Crabtree,
2006). The shared language and experience of nursing is a
combination that can promote understanding and create a
link of trust between participant and interviewer.
The Where
The question of where to hold an interview with peers at first
seems to have only practical considerations: somewhere
quiet to allow the conversation to be taped, somewhere pri-
vate to preserve confidentiality and promote trust, some-
where comfortable so the participant and interviewer can
concentrate on the story, and a place that is not intimidating
so that the participant feels secure (Bryman, 2008;
Liamputtong, 2009). These are pragmatic considerations
with considerable impacts on the ability of the participant to
relax and develop trust with the interviewer and the inter-
view process (Di Ciccio-Bloom & Crabtree, 2006).
Issues of location can be easily overcome but do not
address the powerful forces of felt-space on the interactions
and responses at interview. The dimensions of felt-space as
described by Merleau-Ponty are not restricted to mere cubic
meters or closed doors but have spiritual, personal, and social
implications for those present (Sadala & Adorna, 2002). The
physicality of our situation or "space" can affect behavior
and responses at both conscious and subconscious levels
(van Manen, 1990). The sacred tones of a church or temple
may prompt or inhibit social behaviors that are in contrast to
those initiated within the invigorating atmosphere of a sports
arena. Moreover, the site chosen for the interview has the
potential to shift the power dynamic within the interview.
Different locations may shift dominance from the participant
to the researcher and vice versa (Elwood & Martin, 2000).
For example, an interview held in a hospital ward where the
participant is an expert staff member but the interviewer is in
unfamiliar surroundings will assert a different authority and
direction to the exchange than a neutral setting where the
power balance may be more equal. A startling illustration of
this impact was made during the initial interviews. In the
early stages of data collection, the lead researcher (L.Q.)
agreed to requests from participants for interviews to be con-
ducted at their place of work. At a purely practical level, the
workplace provided a convenient and central location and so
it was agreed to meet at an inner city hospital. The interviews
were organized to be held in a non-clinical room, and consid-
erations of privacy, quiet and the allowance of ample time
were taken into account. However, the workplaces presented
unforeseen obstacles: The participants were still in uniform
and "at work," and within that professional mindset, it was
difficult to gain information about their personal experi-
ences. Responses to open questions were clipped, jargon-
ized, and disconnected from the participants' experiences.
Exploration of personal experiences was sparse, while
detailed information on pathophysiology and treatment was
freely given. The interviews reflected the efficient format of
a clinical handover, but the focus of the research was not
gathering clinical data. Rather, it was aimed at exploring the
experiences of being both a family member and a nurse when
caring for a chronically sick relative, and this information
was either lacking or provided in a lean and meager outline.
4 SAGE Open
As the interviews were coming to a close, the interviewer
noted a sense of distraction and time-urgency as professional
responsibilities resumed priority for the participant. The
researcher found there was a need to intervene and direct the
interview more frequently than usual to guide the conversa-
tion back to exploring the lived experience. This was in sharp
contrast to interviews completed in people's homes, where
participants appeared more relaxed and in control of the pro-
cess of the interview. There was a difference in tone, lan-
guage, and emphasis in the participant responses from
interviews that were held in clinical workplace settings,
compared with those held in neutral or home environments.
There was a consistency in the differences between "at work"
interviews and "home" or "neutral" interviews. van Manen
(1990) recognized the influence of "lived space" and
described it as a "category for inquiring into the ways we
experience the affairs of our day to day existence" (p. 103).
One of the factors of a nurse's day-to-day existence is the
impact of being "in uniform" on language, demeanor, and
outlook (Shaw & Timmons, 2010). Outcomes from research
studies indicate that uniform can influence the level of confi-
dence and self-esteem of the professional nurse and can set
both personal and public expectations of behavior (Shaw &
Timmons, 2010; Spragley & Francis, 2006). The uniform
provides delineation between professional roles and personal
roles; donning a uniform has a powerful connection with
assuming the role of a health professional, and conversely
removing uniform allows the nurse to step away from that
role and resume his or her personal responsibilities (Pearson,
Baker, Walsh, & Fitzgerald, 2001).
Exploring the dynamics of the dual role of the NFC is an
essential part of the research, and conducting interviews at
participants' places of work, while they were in uniform,
seemed to distance the participants from their experiences as
NFCs. The work environment placed participants in a differ-
ent role from the one being researched and may have imposed
implicit and deeply engrained professional standards of com-
munication and behavior. The uniform and the professional
persona inextricably attached to the participants did not
allow the researcher to tap into the life experience being
examined. Of interest, Walker (2011) also found that place
and space were controllable variables during interview and
in her study on family-witnessed cardio-pulmonary resusci-
tation. Workplace interviews brought the responses into con-
text, whereas the more emotionally charged interviews were
held in the home. On reflection, interviewing the participants
at their place of work and in uniform was counterproduc-
tive; it set conflicting expectations and impeded the collec-
tion of rich thick data. The research team has since avoided
using interview venues that alter the dynamics of the partici-
pants' role and ensured that the venue was not work related,
the participants were not in uniform, and they were not
about to commence or had not recently finished work.
Venues that shifted the position of power and authority
such as the lead researcher's workplace were also avoided.
It is recommended that ensuring a neutral environment is
integral to providing safe and ethical research (Kvale &
Brinkmann, 2009). The role of the participant, the language
they used, and levels of trust and rapport are all directly
influenced by the space in which the interview is conducted.
The How
Conversational interviewing in a phenomenological study
requires the researcher to undertake an examination of their
own origins, bias, and understandings; to be supportive of
participants; to be open to understanding their experiences;
and to judiciously share experiences and reciprocate with
participants through a dialogical interview process (Corbin
& Morse, 2003; van Manen, 2014). Heidegger stressed the
importance of understanding our origins or "historicality"
and "situatedness" as being primary to developing under-
standing of others (Heidegger, 1962). The innumerable frag-
ments of our personal background--birthplace, childhood,
schooling, cultural background, profession--will form our
particular understanding of the world. Within Heideggerian
philosophy, reflexivity is performed to raise awareness of the
researcher's life perspective rather than as a means to bracket
these understandings aside (Dowling, 2007). Reflexivity
involves the researcher turning their attention inwardly to
acknowledge and explore personal assumptions, prejudices,
and bias to stimulate understanding of how these may impact
on the research (Clancy, 2013). In addition, reflexivity
enhances awareness of ethical issues inherent in conducting
research into deeply sensitive and personal matters, and as a
direct consequence of this awareness, the researcher is able
to protect the participants from unnecessary harm (Gullemin
& Gilliam, 2004).
Providing support for participants prior to data collection
through the distribution of information sheets and consent
forms is accepted as a requirement prior to any data collec-
tion. Additional to these stock standards, a phenomenologi-
cal study might include an explanation to participants of the
type of information researchers are seeking from them. To
capture the essence of the person's Dasein researchers need
to acknowledge that they value the everydayness of the par-
ticipants' lived experience, so participants were asked to
describe the experience as they lived it. Researchers advised
participants that they valued what others might not see as
important, the emotions and perceptions that were important
to the participant. Participants were encouraged to use anec-
dotes that portrayed the intensity of the lived experience and
were asked to simply relate their experience of being an NFC
in as much detail as they were comfortable with. It is in the
minutiae of emotions, smells, and sounds that understanding
of the intensity and complexity of the experience can be
found (van Manen, 1990). The provision of background
information and expectations of the research provided a
shared purpose between the participant and the researcher.
Providing support for participants was necessary to establish
Quinney et al. 5
a trust relationship and so enable the very purpose of the phe-
nomenological study: that is to understand and explore the
essence of a human experience and to develop a conversa-
tional partnership with the participant that will reveal the
meaning of that experience (van Manen, 1990).
It was not uncommon that prior to the interview starting,
the participant would initiate a social conversation about
shared places of work, shared collegial relationships, and
shared experiences. Most often, the conversation lapsed
quickly into the everyday language of nursing, full of acro-
nyms that would be unintelligible to a non-nurse and humor
that might be confronting to a non-nurse. This often-short
interaction held the beginning of the development of rapport
and trust. The sharing of carefully selected stories from the
experience of the interviewer can reduce the power differen-
tial, establish authenticity and build trust, enabling the inter-
view relationship to move quickly from tentative introduction
into a phase of immersion in rich data (Dickson-Swift,
James, Kippen, & Liamputtong, 2006). Corbin Dwyer and
Buckle (2009) framed this attitude as "You are one of us and
it us versus them (those that do not understand)" (p. 58).
Conversational interviews generally begin with a "grand
tour question." The broad nature of the starting point provides
the participant with the scope to reveal the details of their
experiences according to their priority and personal signifi-
cance (Spradley, 1979). The interviewer guides the progress
of the interview through the judicious use of prompts and
unscripted questioning to clarify and confirm understanding
within a natural dialogue between two people (Roberston-
Malt, 1999; Smythe, Ironside, Sims, Swenson, & Spence,
2008). Conversational interviews proceed with minimal
intervention, so the interaction is significantly less directive
than structured and semi-structured interviews (Corbin &
Morse, 2003). The interviewer is intent on listening to what-
ever the participant says as opposed to directing and control-
ling the exchange and is not only open to but adopts a
willingness to allow the participant to steer the conversation
(Norlyk & Harder, 2010; van Manen, 1990). Consequently,
there is a greater potential for discovery as the interviewees
may reveal insights and experiences that the researcher had
not predicted (Curry, Nembard, & Bradley, 2009).
The phenomenological conversation with peers requires
the researcher to adopt a stance of openness to the unex-
pected (Smythe et al., 2008). Within this study, participants
brought new insights and new opinions that had been gath-
ered from different vantage points. The understandings and
perceptions of the participants contributed to a significant
repository of data that could be used to build a composite
understanding of the phenomenon of being an NFC of a fam-
ily member during acute exacerbations of a chronic disease.
Even though as a researcher who had lived a similar experi-
ence, some of the stories held resonance for the lead
researcher and there were opportunities to share stories.
Sharing stories can be a way of enhancing reciprocity, lev-
eling the participant/researcher power balance and being open
and honest about the lead researcher's "insider" status
(Hayman, Wilkes, Jackson, & Halcomb, 2011). However, it is
important to recognize that having "insider" status holds risks
to the integrity of the interview. The participant may assume
that the researcher understands the concept that they are
speaking of and not go into depth about it.Alternatively, there
is the danger that a researcher may misinterpret the language
of the participant and place their own meaning onto their
words (Corbin Dwyer & Buckle, 2009). It is important to
verify the intended meaning with the participant as the inter-
view progresses so that the essence of the participants'experi-
ence is captured. In addition, caution should be exercised on
behalf of the interviewing researcher regarding the extent of
sharing stories and self-disclosure as there are significant
risks in this approach. Providing detailed information that has
an overlay of opinions and researcher bias may influence the
direction and emphasis of the stories provided by the partici-
pant, thereby skewing the data (Brannick & Coghlan, 2007).
Over disclosure may hold risks for the researcher as the par-
ticipant is not bound by principles of confidentiality and
information about the researcher could be used outside the
interview (Hayman et al., 2011; McConnell-Henry et al.,
2010). The advantage to being a member of this particular
group provided a commonality that allowed a more immedi-
ate acceptance and level of trust (Corbin Dwyer & Buckle,
2009). It also provided the lead researcher with fluency in the
everyday language of being a nurse and of being an NFC.
Nurses who are also researchers have dual roles, primar-
ily as a researcher but also as a nurse with an obligation to
the professional standards and duty of care. The duality of
professional roles and researcher roles can result in role con-
flict (Polkinghorne, 2005). Frequently, there were emotional
responses from participants as they told extremely personal
stories of loss, burden, and frustration. The automatic caring
response from a nurse is to reach out to offer comfort, but
ethical boundaries of research requires the interviewer to
remain in the role of researcher (Asselin, 2003; McConnell-
Henry et al., 2010). There is a clear distinction between the
role of researcher, which is to obtain information, and the
aim of the nurse, which is to provide comfort. To avoid role
conflict or confusion, the interviewer followed the well-
established precedent of clarifying that their role was one of
a researcher and to maintain the stance of researcher in lan-
guage and attitude. Also in line with common practice, the
availability of a qualified counselor was made explicit
(McDermid et al., 2014; Munhall, 2001; Polkinghorne,
2005). However, when faced with the circumstances of dis-
tressed participants describing difficult and sensitive life
experiences, there was inevitably empathy and deep connect-
edness. In the intensity of those moments, the transcripts
show long silences, and the researcher felt a sense of pro-
found and shared togetherness. Corbin and Morse (2003)
advised researchers to recognize the emotional sharing of
feelings but be able to step back and focus on providing the
support that the participant might need.
6 SAGE Open
Recommendations for Applied
Phenomenology
The proposed framework is not offered as a definitive frame-
work for phenomenological research but rather as a useful
starting point for reflection. At the heart of the proposal is a
recommendation that the quality of data collection will be
improved by adherence to the philosophical underpinnings
of phenomenology, and organizing interviews so that the
participant is able to develop a trust relationship with the
interviewer and is able to access the role, language, and
space that is reflected in the research question. Employing
these strategies may deepen and enrich data collection and
may align the process of data collection with the research
methodology. Within the framework depicted in Figure 1,
there are four overlapping considerations of space, language,
role, and trust that impact on the quality of dialogue in the
conversational interview. These elements are interdependent
and can have positive and negative influences on the suc-
cessful conduction of a peer interview. The authors suggest
that when conflicting considerations are removed, there is a
clearing for the interviewer and interviewee to meet and
explore a shared dialogue. The successful conversational
interview is situated within this uncluttered central space that
has had encumbrances, hindrances, and deviators removed.
It is here that the essence of the phenomenon for each partici-
pant can be uncovered and the Dasein of the participant be
revealed. The proposed framework mirrors the concepts of
"Who, Where and How" and may be useful as a structure to
use when planning data collection within a phenomenologi-
cal methodology.
Heidegger highlights interpretation of the richness of
everyday experiences as the conduit to understanding "Being-
in-the-world." For researchers, this fundamental principle
guides all aspects of the research method including data col-
lection. To apply a hermeneutic research approach to the phe-
nomenon, it is essential that participants are enabled to provide
vivid, rich, and authentic accounts of their experiences. The
authors discuss how management of "space, language, role,
and trust," can reduce tension and barriers for the participant
and clear a passage to access the experiences of everyday.
Issues of Space
The relationship between the physical space we are in and
ourselves can influence our perceptions and our interpreta-
tions (Heidegger, 1962; Merleau-Ponty, 1964). Space then
forms and forges our understanding and can have consider-
able power on expression, personal interaction, and commu-
nication. Heidegger suggests that there is an ontological link
to our way of being and the space we are in, "but inasmuch
as any entity within-the-world is likewise in space, its spati-
ality will have an ontological connection to the world. We
must therefore determine in what sense space is a constituent
for that world" (Heidegger, 1962, p. 134). The space that the
participant was interviewed in influenced their interpretation
and understanding and connected them ontologically to the
world of the professional nurse or to the world of the NFC.
Facilitating the accurate expression of personal experi-
ences so that rich, authentic data can contribute to our under-
standing is the very purpose of phenomenological research.
Attention to considerations of space in the planning of the
interview process may produce purer and richer data so that
the essence of the phenomenon is more clearly articulated.
Placing the interview in an environment that minimizes con-
flicting pressures of role and language will reduce confusion
regarding the purpose of the interview and enable the inter-
viewee to tap into the experiences that are the focus of the
research (Merleau-Ponty, 1964).
The space that an interview is conducted in has not only
the practical considerations of promoting trust and preserv-
ing the ethical considerations of the research study but also
subtle and significant influences on the behavior and
responses of the participant (van Manen, 1990). When the
interview is situated in a space that allows the participant to
remain in the role that is consistent with the research focus,
the participant is enabled to respond to the questions authen-
tically in that role. To place the person in an alternative envi-
ronment may cause a level of confusion or role conflict that
Figure1. Data Collection Framework for Phenomenology.
Note. When distracters that cause role confusion or present conflicting
expectations are able to impact on the participant the interview can
produce diluted and meager data. To facilitate participants to access the
specific experiences of the research, extraneous influences should be
removed or minimized from the interview environment, and positive
and authentic influences should be sought to augment access of genuine
thick, rich data. In this study, researchers have identified factors of "space,
language, role, and trust" for consideration; however, the factors that
limit or potentiate accessing thick rich data will be defined by the context
of the study and will not be limited to those described here.

creates unnecessary barriers to the collection of rich thick
data (van Manen, 1990).
Issues of Language
Cultivating the optimal environment for peer interviewing
between a nurse researcher and an NFC presented a tension
between allowing the language of nursing to cultivate a level
of trust and not allowing the language of nursing to divert the
interview into a clinical report. Language within nursing has
traditionally not been an avenue for subjective contempla-
tion but rather a means to objectively convey details between
health professionals using minimal extraneous or emotive
information (Finnegan, Marshall, & Flanagan, 2010). It is
suggested that language changes as participants move from
one role to another. Traditions and historicity of language
reflects the world it refers to (Walsh, 2010). When in the
space of a nurse and in the role of a nurse, the traditions of
nursing will be reflected in the language that is used.
Consequently, the language and story that is the focus of
the study may be missing if the participant is situated in a
role, or a way of Being-in-the-world, which has a tradition of
discouraging one sort of language perhaps that of subjective,
emotive language and encouraging a different sort of lan-
guage perhaps that of clinical abbreviations. "Language is
not identical with the sum total of all the words printed in a
dictionary; instead language is as Dasein is . . . it exists"
(Heidegger, 1982, p. 208). Heidegger saw language as a way
of making our interpretations of the world manifest to others:
a way of recognizing and pointing out events and experi-
ences that are of particular significance to Dasein (Dreyfus,
1991). Language obtains meaning from the world we dwell
in, which is influenced by the role and space we occupy.
The considerations of space and role are clearly interde-
pendent and have some influence upon the language with
which the participant's story is relayed. Professional roles
place significant expectations on demeanor and language. It
was found that although the NFC would use the language of
nursing in their home to expedite understanding with another
health professional, the tone of the delivery was very differ-
ent from the abbreviated and objective reports of interviews
held in a workplace. When the participants were interviewed
at home, they relayed stories that were full of emotion, rich
in description and highlighted by anecdotes that enabled the
researchers to connect to the participant's stories.
Familiarity with the everyday language of the participant
can allow the interviewer access to a huge reservoir of mean-
ing that might be lost on someone who is not familiar with
that language (van Manen, 1990). The specifics of a shared
language are in itself a way of Being-in-the-world and for the
participants and interviewer can be opportunity to explore
the Dasein of nursing and of being an NFC.
The way in which discourse gets expressed is language.
Language is a totality of words--a totality in which discourse
has a "worldly" Being of its own; and as an entity within-the-
world, this totality thus becomes something which we may come
across as ready-to-hand. (Heidegger, 1962, p. 204)
Issues of Role
Gathering rich, authentic data is facilitated when the partici-
pant is in the role under inquiry. When interviewing a nurse
about clinical matters, it is reasonable to conduct the inter-
view in a quiet part of the clinical environment. When con-
ducting interviews about family carers, careful planning and
placement of the interview will allow the participant to more
fully access the memories and lived experiences that are
being researched. Aspects of the participant's role, which
may be determined by role, space, and language among other
factors, are important considerations when arranging phe-
nomenological interviews to ensure the data are both rich
and genuine and that the essence of the phenomena is brought
forward. Heidegger directs us to observe the essential ele-
ments of the person's everyday Dasein. "The answer to the
`who' of everyday Dasein is to be obtained by analysing that
kind of Being in which Dasein maintains itself proximally
and for the most part" (Heidegger, 1962, p. 153).
In addition, role conflict has been identified as an ever-
present risk for nurse researchers (Asselin, 2003; McConnell-
Henry et al., 2010). In situations where there are sensitive
and emotive issues or issues where standards of care are not
met, there is a danger that the nurse researcher can disregard
their role as a researcher and respond as a health provider or
as a nurse counselor. When interviewing participants who
are also colleagues and/or friends, there can be a blurring of
roles and the shift between friend/colleague to researcher and
back again can be difficult (Taylor, 2011). The participant
may be aware that the researcher/friend now has new insights
into deeply personal and sensitive aspects of their life world
and reassurance about the integrity of the researcher needs to
be both voiced and actioned (Karnieli-Miller, Strier, &
Pessach, 2009). Pre-existing friendships may result in an
assumption on the part of the interviewer that they already
understand the perspective of the participant, thereby blur-
ring the perception and interpretation of the data provided by
participants (Taylor, 2011). Nurse researchers conducting
research that involve participants who have a pre-existing
relationship need to be aware of potential conflict and to pro-
actively manage issues of trust through reflexivity and reci-
procity and so that role conflict is minimized.
Issues of Trust
Establishment of a relationship that has a basis of trust is
fundamental to achieving the desired outcomes for both
interviewer and interviewee. Facilitation of trust in the par-
ticipant­researcher relationship begins in the interactions
prior to the actual interview and continues throughout.
Nurturing this initial and fragile stage of establishing trust
8 SAGE Open
requires time and attention to the nuances within the shared
dialogue (Laverty, 2003; Polkinghorne, 2005). Factors that
contribute to nurturing trust include providing a safe private
space so that the participant feels comfortable and confident
when speaking about very personal aspects of their life.
The term conversational interview intimates that there is
reciprocity and dialogue between the participant and the
researcher. Transition into dialogue that provides rich and
thick data can be achieved more quickly when a common
and shared language releases the participant from the need to
interpret or alter their speech patterns for the interviewer.
The participant is able to relax into the speech of their every-
day, "what is said-in-the talk, as such; the communication;
and the making known. These are not properties which can
be just raked up empirically from language. They are exis-
tential characteristics rooted in the state of Dasein's being"
(Heidegger, 1962). Following on from this, trust can emerge
quickly when the participant and researcher have a level of
common understanding from being members of a group with
similar but different life experiences (Corbin Dwyer &
Buckle, 2009). Heidegger provides a phenomenological con-
text for this
This Dasein-with of the Others is disclosed within-the-world for
a Dasein, and so too for those who are Dasein with us (die
Mitdaseienden), only because Dasein in itself is essentially
Being-with. The phenomenological assertion that "Dasein is
essentially Being-with" has an existential­ontological meaning.
(Heidegger, 1962, p. 156)
The amount of time required and the degree of nurturing
to establish trust is unique; there is no time schedule to
achieve a perfect interview. However, during the interview
opportunities exist to establish a reciprocal relationship that
is grounded in dialogue and can potentiate a positive experi-
ence for both the participant and the interviewer (Kvale &
Brinkmann, 2009). Mutual respect and trust enables the
interview to transcend the superficial and provide deep rich
data for the purpose of the research. Recognizing the crucial
significance of the quality of the relationship imposes
responsibilities upon the interviewer to make provisions for
the needs of the participant while remaining true to the pur-
pose of the dialogue, which is to explore the lived experience
and describe the essences of that experience.
Conclusion
The dual role held by NFC's may well provide them with
powerful insights and important perspectives that are not
available to other health care workers. The lack of research
in this area represents a lost opportunity to inform the prac-
tices of health care and improve outcomes for all people who
are chronically ill. Conducting conversational interviews
with this group of participants presents the challenge to peer
researchers to glean data consistent with a Heideggerian
hermeneutic study and respect the gift of the participant's
stories. Issues of space, language, role, and trust were identi-
fied as crucial in achieving an interview environment which
provided NFC's with an opportunity to voice their lived
experiences. The article reinforces the development of a trust
relationship to enrich the experience for both participant and
interviewer. Practical examples of how contextualizing the
research question from the standpoint of the participant and
providing an authentic space which reflects the contribution
of the participant can enhance the interview process have
been provided.
Heidegger celebrated the facticity of our lives and opposed
the Cartesian approach of reducing our lived experiences to
surface qualities (Harman, 2007). The framework that has
been offered has been explicated through the philosophies of
Heideggerian hermeneutics and provides a platform to dis-
cuss the dearth of methodical direction associated with
Hermeneutic Phenomenology. It is incumbent upon research-
ers working within a Heideggerian construct to align meth-
odology with the philosophy of phenomenology.
