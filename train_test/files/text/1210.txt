ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION
End-of-Life Care
Findings From a National Survey of Informal Caregivers
Jennifer L. Wolff, PhD; Sydney M. Dy, MD; Kevin D. Frick, PhD; Judith D. Kasper, PhD
Background: Family and friends are thought to be the
predominant providers of end-of-life care, although na-
tionally representative data on this topic have been
lacking.
Methods: This study draws from the 1999 National Long-
Term Care Survey and its Informal Caregivers Survey to
characterize primary informal caregivers' experiences pro-
viding end-of-life care to chronically disabled community-
dwelling older adults. Study participants were 1149 pri-
mary informal caregivers, stratified by care recipients'
survival or death during the following 12 months.
Results: An estimated 11.2% of the chronically dis-
abled community-dwelling older adults died within 1 year
of being interviewed. Among persons who died, 72.3%
were receiving help from an informal caregiver at the time
of the interview. End-of-life primary informal caregiv-
ers helped an average of 43 hours per week, 84.4% pro-
vided daily assistance, and caregiver support services were
infrequently used (ie, respite care and support groups were
used by less than 5% of caregivers). While end-of-life care-
givers reported significant emotional (28.9%), physical
(18.4%), and financial (14.0%) strains, more than two
thirds endorsed personal rewards related to their help-
ing role. Compared with primary informal caregivers of
persons who survived the following 12 months, end-of-
life caregivers provided significantly higher levels of as-
sistance and reported more challenges and strains, but
they were no less likely to endorse rewards related to their
helping role.
Conclusions: End-of-life caregivers provide frequent and
intense assistance with few supportive services. These data
underscore the relevance of families to end-of-life care,
and the potential benefit of better integrating families in
patient care.

FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE THE
predominant providers of
both long-term1 and end-of-
life care.2,3 Several studies
have documented high lev-
els of assistance provided by family at the
end of life,2,4,5 as well as accompanying
emotional, physical, and financial strains
associated with providing this help.4-8 This
body of work collectively indicates that
families exert considerable influence on
end-of-life care,9-11 and that their involve-
ment represents an important concep-
tual dimension of what constitutes a good
death.12,13
While existing studies provide insight
into families' experiences in providing end-
of-lifecare,thereareseveralimportantgaps
in knowledge. First, studies to date have
predominantly relied on family members
of decedents8,14 or individuals identified as
actively dying.2,4 Yet, death is difficult to
predict, and individuals thought to be near
death disproportionately represent par-
ticular terminal conditions or end-of-life
trajectories.15-17 Likewise, relying on the re-
call of family members of decedents is sub-
optimal because remembrances of the in-
tensity or experience of providing care may
evolve subsequent to the event.18,19 Lastly,
that the provision of end-of-life care may
generate its own rewards3 and that indi-
viduals approaching death value their on-
going contributions to others20 are con-
cepts that have been recognized but are
largely absent from empirical research to
date.

ticipants were receiving in their last year of life. Among in-
dividuals receiving help from family or friends, we inves-
tigate the nature and intensity of help provided by primary
informal caregivers, use of community-based supportive
services, and caregivers' perceptions of their role, includ-
ing both related burdens and rewards.
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION
Data for this study were obtained from the 1999 National Long-
Term Care Survey (NLTCS) and the NLTCS Informal Care-
giver Survey (NICS). The NLTCS is a nationally representa-
tive survey of Americans aged 65 years and older that was
specifically designed to study the prevalence of chronic dis-
ability.21,22 Medicare enrollment files constituted the sampling
frame; screening interviews were conducted to determine eli-
gibility for a detailed interview. In-person community inter-
views were conducted with participants, or with proxy respon-
dents when participants were unavailable or unable to respond.
The response rate exceeded 97% for the 1999 NLTCS commu-
nity interview.23 The NICS was conducted with the primary care-
giver (relative or unpaid nonrelative) who provided the most
hours of help to the NLTCS participant with activities of daily
living or instrumental activities of daily living in the week prior
to the community interview. The design of the NICS has been
described in detail elsewhere.24
In this study we compare primary caregivers' experiences
by care recipients' survival status, although our main objec-
tive was to elucidate the experiences of family caregivers pro-
viding end-of-life care. The NLTCS and NICS were adminis-
tered to participants and their primary informal caregivers during
the fall of 1999 (the NLTCS preceded the NICS since caregiv-
ers were identified in the NLTCS). The 1999 NLTCS partici-
pants' subsequent 12-month survival was based on the date of
the NLTCS participant interview and dates of death recorded
in the vital statistics file. A total of 3115 community-dwelling
NLTCS participants screened into the NLTCS as chronically
disabled, of whom 1622 were determined to have been receiv-
ing assistance from an informal caregiver. Of these, 251 per-
sons died within 12 months of interview and 182 of their care-
givers completed the NICS (72.5% response). Among the 1371
chronically disabled NLTCS participants who were receiving
assistance from an informal caregiver and who survived 12
months following their interview, a total of 967 primary care-
givers completed the NICS (70.5% response).
ESTIMATION AND DATA ANALYSIS
Observations from the NLTCS and NICS must be weighted to
produce nationally representative estimates and to account for
its complex sampling strategies. Detailed community weights
released with the NLTCS were used in this study to generate
population estimates of chronically disabled community-
dwelling older adults. In addition, as outlined elsewhere,24 we
constructed weights for primary caregivers to chronically dis-
abled community-dwelling older adults so as to generalize to
caregivers nationally.
Demographic, economic, and health characteristics of chroni-
cally disabled older adults and chronically disabled older adults
receiving help from an informal caregiver were first examined
and were stratified by their survival throughout the 12 months
following the date of their NLTCS detailed community inter-
view. We compared primary caregivers' sociodemographic char-
acteristics, types of assistance provided, perceptions of their help-
ing role, and use of community and supportive services, stratified
by recipients' survival status. All analyses were calculated us-
ing SAS version 9.1 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) us-
ing the Taylor expansion method to account for the complex
sampling strategy of the NLTCS in estimating sampling er-
rors. Estimates that cannot be considered reliable (relative stan-
dard errors exceeding 30%) are noted in the tables.
MEASUREMENTS
Key measures for care recipients included demographic char-
acteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, and marital status
[whether they were widowed]), living arrangement, socioeco-
nomic factors (education, health insurance), and health status
(self-rated health and functional disability). Personal assis-
tance referred to active or standby help with activities of daily
living (eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, and in-
door mobility), and help with instrumental activities of daily
living tasks (grocery shopping, transportation, laundry, light
housework, managing money, meal preparation, using the tele-
phone, medication management, and outdoor mobility) be-
cause of a health problem or disability.
Forprimaryinformalcaregiversweexaminedage,gender,self-
rated health, relationship to recipient (spouse, child, or other),
and whether they lived with the care recipient. Information re-
garding caregiver commitment included duration of time pro-
viding help, frequency of help, hours of assistance provided in
the previous week, and types of task assistance provided. Pri-
mary caregivers' perceptions included challenges, burdens, and
rewards experienced in their role, as well as the reciprocal ex-
changes by the person to whom they provided assistance. Lastly,
we examined use of community-based supportive services.
RESULTS
CHARACTERISTICS OF DESCENDENTS
Of an estimated 5.6 million chronically disabled older
adults who were living in the community during 1999,
631 000 (11.2%) died within 12 months (Table 1). Rela-
tive to community-dwelling chronically disabled older
adults who survived, individuals in the last year of life
were significantly older and more likely to be male, to
live with others, to report fair or poor health, and to carry
a higher burden of functional disability.
A total of 72.3% of chronically disabled older adults
in the last year of life were receiving help from family or
friends compared with 48.6% of chronically disabled older
adults who survived the following year. Relative to chroni-
cally disabled older adults who received informal help
and who survived the following year, recipients of in-
formal care in the last year of life were significantly more
likely to be male, to report fair or poor self-rated health,
and to carry a greater burden of functional disability.
HELP FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS
Primary informal caregivers to individuals in the last year
of life were spouses (41.5%), children (39.0%), and oth-
ers (19.5%) (Table 2). End-of-life caregivers were, on
average, 64 years of age, tended to be female (75.1%),
and were mainly in excellent or good health (66.3%). The
duration of time over which they had provided assis-
tance varied from less than 1 year (26.5%) to over 4 years

(31.5%). End-of-life caregivers helped a mean of 43 hours
per week; 84.4% provided daily assistance. They helped
with shopping and transportation (85.3%), household
tasks (82.8%), personal care and nursing (64.8%), fi-
nances (52.3%), administration of medicine (50.9%), and
indoor mobility (38.6%).
Who served as primary caregiver, the likelihood of liv-
ing with their care recipient, and self-rated health status
did not vary significantly by recipients' survival. How-
ever, relative to primary informal caregivers of individu-
als who survived, end-of-life caregivers were signifi-
cantly more likely to be female, to have helped for a shorter
period, and to be providing more intense and frequent
assistance with tasks relating to personal care and nurs-
ing and medication administration.
PERCEPTIONS OF
THE CAREGIVER ROLE
Primary caregivers to individuals in the last year of life
reported providing assistance when they did not feel well
(53.5%), that their sleep was interrupted due to provid-
ing help (44.8%), that care recipients could not be left
alone (36.8%), and that special medical care was re-
quired that they could not provide (18.5%) (Table 3).
These challenges tended to be significantly more com-
mon among end-of-life caregivers. End-of-life caregiv-
ers also reported significantly greater emotional (28.9%)
and physical (18.4%) strains (but not financial strains)
relative to other primary caregivers.
Large proportions of end-of-life primary caregivers en-
dorsed statements regarding the rewards and reciproc-
ity afforded by their helping role; the proportions were
comparable in magnitude to that of other caregivers. Ap-
proximately 70% of end-of-life caregivers agreed or
strongly agreed with the statement that helping "makes
me feel good about myself" and "enables me to appreci-
ate life more," and 76.0% of caregivers reported that help-
ing made them "feel useful and needed." A substantial
proportion of primary caregivers acknowledged recip-
rocated exchanges with the person to whom they pro-
vided assistance, reporting that recipients helped "keep
me company" (65.0%), helped financially (26.0%), and
helped with household chores (20.8%).
USE OF
SUPPORTIVE SERVICES
Use of community-based supports that were most com-
monly reported by end-of-life caregivers included assis-

tive devices (62.3%), personal or nursing care services
(37.2%), and home modifications (28.3%)--supportive
services that are directed toward the health and func-
tioning of recipients (Table 4). Services for housework
(13.6%), delivered meals (11.2%), or transportation
(6.2%) were less commonly used. In terms of tradi-
tional caregiver-related support services, less than 5% of
all primary caregivers reported having participated in care-
giver support groups, used respite services, or enrolled
their loved one in a program outside the home. Relative
to other primary caregivers, end-of-life caregivers re-
ported statistically significant greater use of assistive de-
vices and home modifications but were approximately
half as likely to report the use of transportation services
(P.06) or respite care (P.06).
COMMENT
Drawing from a nationally representative survey of chroni-
cally disabled community-dwelling older adults and their
primary caregivers, this study confirms family and friends
to be the chief providers of end-of-life assistance. Nearly
three quarters of chronically disabled older adults in the
last year of life received help from family and friends. Pri-
mary informal caregivers provided an average of 43 hours
of help per week and 84.4% helped daily; supportive ser-
vices were infrequently used. At the same time, a higher
proportion of end-of-life primary informal caregivers en-
dorsed personal rewards that accompanied their help-
ing role than identified related emotional, physical, or
financial strains.
The mean 43 hours of weekly assistance that was pro-
vided by end-of-life primary caregivers is substantially
higher than what has been previously reported in na-
tional studies of family caregivers,24,25 and is compa-
rable to the 46 hours of help reported by one end-of-life
study conducted among caregivers of persons with de-
mentia.5 Thus, chronically disabled older individuals
within 1 year of death were receiving assistance equat-
ing to 1 full-time equivalent worker from their primary
caregiver alone. This finding is pertinent to discussions
on end-of-life care in that most studies regarding the costs
of end-of-life care have limited their scope to those costs

incurred by health insurance programs or to families out
of pocket.26-28 While the economic value of assistance pro-
vided by family caregivers has been well documented in
the literature,29-32 it has not been adequately articulated
as a dimension of end-of-life care.
Despite the intensity and challenges related to pro-
viding assistance, more than two thirds of end-of-life car-
egivers reported that they derived personal rewards from
their helping role. Approximately 70% of caregivers re-
ported that providing help "enables me to appreciate life
more" and "makes me feel good about myself." A nota-
bly greater proportion of end-of-life primary caregivers
endorsed rewards associated with helping than identi-
fied emotional, physical, and financial burdens; a find-
ing that, to our knowledge, has heretofore not been noted
in the published literature. Importantly, whereas end-
of-life caregivers were more likely to identify challenges
and burdens than other long-term caregivers, they were
no less likely to identify a sense of rewards. Quantifying
these rewards is important because concerns about be-
ing burdensome are thought to loom large among indi-
viduals at the end of life,12,13 and are thought to be a fac-
tor in patients' end-of-life treatment decisions.4,33
Seriously ill patients have expressed the importance
of ongoing daily interactions with family and friends, and
the ability to help others as components of a good
death.13,20 Data from this study indicate that primary care-
givers were readily able to identify reciprocated emo-
tional, instrumental, and financial exchanges afforded to
them by the person to whom they provided assistance.
We are unaware of other studies that have examined mu-
tuality of exchanges within caregiving dyads at the end
of life; the frequency of these interactions and stated im-
portance to seriously ill or dying patients suggest this topic
merits further inquiry.
Results from this study indicate that few supportive
services are used by chronically disabled older adults and
their primary informal caregivers, regardless of sur-
vival. This finding is consistent with other work show-
ing limited use of paid services by individuals nearing
death,2 and the low take-up of support services among
informal caregivers.34 We cannot comment on the pres-
ence or nature of barriers to accessing supportive ser-
vices, or the extent to which these services were per-
ceived as desirable or needed. That said, by quantifying
nonmedical service use near the end of life, this study
provides important insight on a topic that is not well un-
derstood35 and that is highly relevant to policy makers
interested in reconfiguring the health system to better ad-
dress the needs of chronically disabled older adults and
their families.
There are several important limitations of this study.
The sample was restricted to older adults who were
chronically disabled and we, therefore, cannot com-
ment on help received by working-age adults or older
adults without chronic disability. In addition, our cat-
egorization of help that individuals were receiving prior
to death was assessed at a single point in time, while par-
ticipants' health needs and personal care arrangements
were not static. For example, individuals in the last year
of life who were not receiving help from an informal care-
giver carried a lower burden of functional disability, and
it may well be that some portion of persons in this group
had no need for personal care at the time they were in-
terviewed. From this standpoint, the 72.3% of chroni-
cally disabled older adults who were found to have re-
ceived help from family, friends, or both prior to their
death may underestimate the reliance on family, be-
cause some portion of older adults who were catego-
rized as being without help may have subsequently ac-
quired a family caregiver. Likewise, families' experiences
and perceptions in providing assistance may shift with
impending death, yet we relied on a crude categoriza-
tion that only accounted for 12-month survival.
The heterogeneity of the study sample inhibits our abil-
ity to describe caregivers' experiences by virtue of spe-
cific diseases, timing, or site of death, or to compare our
findings with other evidence from the end-of-life litera-
ture. The particular constellation of disease or diseases
being managed, decedents' end-of-life trajectory, and tem-
poral proximity to death are all apt to influence families'
experiences providing care. For example, understand-
ing decedents' trajectories of dying could have helped in-
form our finding that end-of-life caregivers were less likely
to be long-term caregivers.17 We would have ideally liked
to have further examined families' experiences on sev-
eral of these dimensions; however, the study sample was
insufficient in size for this level of subanalysis. While we
acknowledge the limitations of relying on a heteroge-
neous, population-based study sample, most of what is
known about the circumstances of family care at the end
of life has been derived from studies of individuals with
a single disease,5,7,10 within a single setting,8,11 or with a
clear dying trajectory.2,4,35 Although the sample of end-
of-life caregivers is small, by drawing from a nationally
representative survey this study provides valuable infor-
mation about the end-of-life experience for a broader

population than has been typically represented in this
literature.
Findings from this study have practical implications
for physicians and other health care professionals. That
nearly three quarters of chronically disabled older adults
in the last year of life received help from an informal care-
giver underscores the relevance of family to end-of-life
patient care, and the potential benefit of productive col-
laborative relationships between physicians, patients, and
families. Collectively, the literature on end-of-life care-
givers suggests a role for physicians in monitoring the
well-being of seriously ill or dying patients, as well as their
caregivers; considering the health status and needs of both
members of the caregiving dyad collectively, as a unit.7,36
However, the general perception of families, particu-
larly family members of severely ill, hospitalized, or dy-
ing patients, is that communication with health care pro-
fessionals is far from adequate.14,20,37-41 Although there has
been some recognition that the health care community
should better acknowledge the contributions and needs
of patients' families and friends,42-44 much remains to be
learned regarding how families should be integrated in
medical care.45 By doing so, health care professionals might
better capitalize on families' ability to serve as a re-
source and ally in patient care, and potentially benefit
both patients and their families.4,46,47
This is, to our knowledge, the first study to draw from
a nationally representative surveyof primaryinformal care-
givers to examine their experiences providing care to in-
dividualsinthelastyearoflife.Informationreportedherein
confirmstheintensityandfrequencyofend-of-lifecare,and
helps elucidate the pathway by which the provision of such
assistance may generate adverse health consequences. Ad-
ditional research leadingtoadvances in the health care pro-
fessionals' practice is much needed in this area, and will
only grow in importance given evidence of declining in-
hospital deaths, the demonstrated health effects of provid-
ing end-of-life assistance, and demographic trends that will
make end-of-life care among chronically disabled older
adults an increasingly common experience.
