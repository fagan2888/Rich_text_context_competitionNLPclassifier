Background. Optimal mental health (cognitive and emotional functioning) is an important factor for maintaining
physical function. This study investigated the effects of cognitive and emotional status on subsequent lower body func-
tion in a population-based sample of older Mexican Americans.
Methods. A 2-year prospective cohort study included Mexican Americans aged 65 and older who scored 18 or
higher on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at baseline interview and for whom complete data on a summary
performance measure of lower body function were available at the 2-year follow-up interview (n  2068). In-home inter-
views in 1993­1994 and 1995­1996 assessed sociodemographic variables, physical health conditions, cognitive func-
tion, emotional health, and lower body function.
Results. In a multivariate analysis, continuous MMSE (b  0.06; SE 0.02, p  .004) and Center for Epidemiological
Studies­Depression (CES-D) (b  0.53; SE 0.17, p  .002) scores at baseline were significantly associated with a
summary performance measure of lower body function 2 years later, controlling for age, gender, marital status, educa-
tion, selected medical conditions, and baseline summary performance score. A significant MMSE­by­CES-D interac-
tion (p  .002) on summary performance score was also found after adjustments were made for age, gender, marital
status, education, chronic health conditions, and baseline summary performance score. After adjusting for age, gender,
marital status, education, selected medical conditions, and baseline summary performance score, subjects with low cog-
nition (MMSE score 18­21) and high depressive symptoms (CES-D score  16) were the most likely to have poor sum-
mary performance scores 2 years later (b  0.95, SE 0.36, p  .008), followed by subjects with high cognition
(MMSE score  21) and high depressive symptoms (CES-D score  16) (b  0.57, SE 0.19, p  .003), and those
with low cognition (MMSE score 18­21) and low depressive symptoms (CES-D score  16) (b  0.47, SE 0.22, p 
.03), with high cognition (MMSE score  21) and low depressive symptoms (CES-D score  16) used as the reference.
Conclusions. Our results confirm prior investigations showing both cognitive function and emotional health predict
subsequent lower body function, and extend these findings to older Mexican Americans. In addition, our results indicate
that good emotional health moderates the impact of low cognition on subsequent physical function.
PTIMAL mental health (cognitive and emotional func-
tioning) is an important factor for maintaining physical
function. The deleterious effects of poor mental health in
late life on functional ability have been well characterized
(1­11). Several aging studies have reported on the relation-
ship between poor cognitive functioning and increased limi-
tations in activities of daily living (ADLs) (1­5). Moritz
and colleagues, using data from the New Haven Estab-
lished Populations for Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly
(EPESE), showed that the odds of reporting disability in
ADLs at the 3-year follow-up were about 2.5 times greater
in subjects with low cognitive ability at baseline compared
with those with normal cognitive ability (2). Data from the
Nun Study showed older women with low-normal cognitive
function on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at
baseline had twice the risk of ADL disability at follow-up
relative to those with high-normal cognition (3).
Studies have also reported on the association between
emotional health and subsequent disability among older
adults (6­11). Cronin-Stubbs and colleagues, in a study of
3434 older persons living in the community, reported a gra-
dient of risk between increasing number of depressive
symptoms and ADL disability, adjusting for relevant risk
factors (11). Penninx and colleagues reported in a group of
1286 community-dwelling persons aged 71 years and older
that an increasing number of depressive symptoms at base-
line was a significant predictor of declining lower body
function 4 years later, adjusting for relevant sociodemo-
graphic factors and health status (9).
It is not clear, however, if cognitive ability and emotional
health interact to affect physical functioning in older Mexican
Americans. Thus, the purpose of this study is two-fold. First,
we investigate the independent relationships of cognitive
ability and emotional health on lower-body function 2 years
later in a community sample of older Mexican Americans.
Second, because past research has shown good emotional
health to positively influence the rate of recovery 1-year post
medical event (12), we plan to test the hypothesis that good

emotional health will moderate the association between low
cognitive ability and decline in lower body function.
METHODS
Sample
Data are from the Hispanic Established Population for the
Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (H-EPESE). The H-EPESE
is an ongoing National Institute on Aging-funded commu-
nity-based study of 3050 Mexican American subjects aged
65 and older (13). The sample was designed to be generaliz-
able to approximately 85% of older Mexican Americans liv-
ing in five southwestern states including Texas, California,
Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico (13). A full description
of the rationale, methods, and subject characteristics can be
found elsewhere (13). The response rate at baseline inter-
view (1993­1994) was 83%, with 2873 (94.2%) subjects in-
terviewed in person and 177 (5.8%) by proxy. At the 2-year
follow-up interview, 2167 (71.1%) subjects were reinter-
viewed in person and 272 (8.9%) by proxy. Only subjects
who scored 18 or higher on the MMSE were asked to at-
tempt the lower-body performance tasks. Thus, the present
study includes data on subjects who scored 18 or higher on
the MMSE and who also had complete data on a summary
performance measure of lower body function (n  2068) at
the 2-year follow-up interview (1995­1996).
Measures
Cognitive function.--The MMSE is a 30-item measure-
ment instrument used to assess cognitive function. It is
among the most frequently used cognitive screening mea-
sures in studies of older adults (14), but it cannot be used to
diagnose dementia. The English and Spanish versions of the
MMSE were adopted from the Diagnostic Interview Scale
(DIS) and have been used in prior community surveys (15).
Scores have a potential range of 0 to 30, with lower scores
indicating poorer cognitive ability. MMSE score was used
as a continuous variable (range 18­30) and was dichoto-
mized as 18­21 (n  334) and 22­30 (n  1734) (16).
Emotional health.--The Center for Epidemiological
Studies­Depression (CES-D) scale is widely used as a mea-
sure of emotional health in community studies of older peo-
ple (17,18). The CES-D consists of 20 items in which sub-
jects are asked whether they have experienced certain
positive or negative feelings or symptoms in the past week.
Responses are scored on a four-point scale (0 to 3). Scores
for the positive items are reversed and the 20 items
summed. The CES-D has a potential range of 0 to 60, with
higher scores indicating increased depressive symptoms. In
the analysis, CES-D score was used both as a continuous
and dichotomized variable. Individuals with a score of less
than 16 were classified as having low depressive symptoms
(n  1619), and those with scores 16 or more were classi-
fied as having high depressive symptoms (n  432) (17).
Summary performance measure of lower body func-
tion.--The summary performance measure is comprised of
three lower-body activities: a timed 8-foot walk, rising from
a chair five times, and a hierarchical standing balance task
(19,20). Using previously established criteria (19), perfor-
mance on each task is classified on a scale ranging from 0 to
4. Subjects unable to perform the particular task received a
0 score, and a 1­4 score was assigned to those able to com-
plete the task. When the three tasks were summed, an over-
all summary performance measure score ranging from 0 to
12 was created, where higher scores represented better func-
tioning.
Covariates
Baseline sociodemographic variables included age, gen-
der, marital status, education, and selected health condi-
tions. Subjects were asked if they ever had a physician diag-
nosis of heart attack, stroke, arthritis, or diabetes.
Statistical Analyses
We examined selected baseline variables for all subjects
who scored 18 or higher on the MMSE at baseline by sum-
mary performance category using contingency tables (2
analysis using a two-tailed p value  .05). Four multivariate
General Linear Models (GLMs) assessed the independent
relationship of continuous MMSE and CES-D score at base-
line on summary performance score 2 years later. The first
model included the continuous MMSE and CES-D scores,
and summary performance score; the second model added
age, gender, marital status, and education; and the third
model added selected medical conditions including heart at-
tack, stroke, diabetes, and arthritis. The fourth GLM model
added the continuous MMSE­by­CES-D interaction term.
Using GLM models, we next examined the association of
high (score  21) and low (score  21) MMSE score by
high (score  16) and low (score  16) CES-D score on
summary performance score 2 years later. The first model
adjusted for baseline summary performance score, age, gen-
der, marital status, and education, and the second model
added selected health conditions including heart attack,
stroke, diabetes, and arthritis.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents baseline sociodemographic characteris-
tics, selected diseases, CES-D and MMSE scores, by sum-
mary performance category 2 years later. Subjects aged 65­
74 were more likely to have higher summary performance
scores 2 years later, while those aged 85 and older were
more likely to have lower summary performance scores 2
years later. Women, the unmarried, and those with less edu-
cation, CES-D  16, and lower MMSE scores were more
likely to be in the lowest summary performance category at
follow up.
Figure 1 shows the percent change in summary perfor-
mance score from baseline to the 2-year follow-up by CES-D
(16 and 16) and MMSE category (18­21 and 22). Per-
cent change was categorized as a decline, no change, or im-
provement. For the four categories, approximately one third
of the subjects declined, one-half improved, and the remain-
der showed no change in summary performance score. Non-
significant differences were found between the CES-D cate-
gory of 16 and 16 (p  .56) and the MMSE category of
18­21 and 22 (p  .21).

Table 2 presents three multivariate linear regression anal-
yses predicting summary performance score at the 2-year
follow-up as a function of baseline continuous MMSE and
CES-D scores. In Model 1, after adjusting for baseline sum-
mary performance score, the regression coefficients for
MMSE (b  0.10, SE .02, p  .0001) and CES-D (b 
0.56, SE .17, p  .0009) were significantly associated with
summary performance score 2 years later. With the addition
of age, gender, marital status, and education (Model 2), both
MMSE and CES-D remained significant predictors of sum-
mary performance score. Both variables continued to be sig-
nificant with the further addition of selected medical condi-
tions (Model 3). Using MMSE and CES-D as continuous
variables and adjusting for the variables in Model 3, we then
investigated the relationship between an MMSE­by­CES-D
interaction term on 2-year summary performance score. A
significant MMSE­by­CES-D interaction (p  .002) was
observed.
Table 3 presents two multivariate GLM models predict-
ing summary performance score 2 years later by a four-level
hierarchical MMSE­by­CES-D variable. In Model 1, after
adjusting for baseline summary performance score, age,
gender, marital status, and education, the results indicated a
gradient of risk for the MMSE­by­CES-D variable. Sub-
jects in the low MMSE (score 18­21) and high CES-D
(score  16) category declined by 0.99 points on the sum-
mary performance measure 2 years later (average score
6.20, SD 3.91), followed by a 0.63-point decline for subjects
in the high MMSE (score  21) and high CES-D (score 
16) category (average score 6.94, SD 3.80), and a 0.42-point
decline for those in the low MMSE (score 18­21) and low
CES-D (score  16) category (average score 6.20, SD
3.40). The average summary performance score for those in
the reference category of high MMSE (score  21) and low
CES-D (score  16) was 8.46 (SD 3.06). The results were
similar in Model 2 with the addition of heart attack, stroke,
diabetes, and arthritis.
DISCUSSION
Our findings can be summarized as follows. There is a
significant relationship between higher baseline MMSE
score and physical performance score 2 years later among
older Mexican Americans, after adjusting for relevant so-
ciodemographic characteristics, selected medical condi-
tions, and summary performance score at baseline. Addi-
tionally, we found a significant inverse relationship between
baseline CES-D score and physical performance score 2
years later. These findings are consistent with previous
studies (1­11). We also found a previously unreported inter-
action between cognition and emotional status. Subjects
with poor cognitive and CES-D scores were significantly
more likely to have poorer summary performance scores 2
years later compared to those with poor cognition and
nondepressed affect. The interaction between MMSE and
CES-D score on summary performance suggests that the
presence of subsyndromal depressive symptoms may exac-
erbate the deleterious effect of impaired cognition on physi-
cal performance in older adults.
Previous research has demonstrated an association be-
tween depression and impaired physical function among
older adults with dementia (21­24). These studies suggest
that clinical depression is a major contributor to excess dis-
ability. Past studies in older adults have also shown that
subsyndromal depressive symptoms are significantly asso-
ciated with incident disability and subsequent physical de-
cline in older blacks and whites (9­11,25). For instance,
Penninx and colleagues, using a summary performance
measure, showed depressive symptoms were predictive of
subsequent physical decline in community-living older
adults (9). Our results extend these studies by showing the

independent and interactive effect of cognitive and emo-
tional status on subsequent lower body functioning in a co-
hort of community-dwelling older Mexican Americans.
There are several hypotheses on how emotion might inter-
act with cognition to influence subsequent physical function.
For instance, the increased risk of disability associated with
depressive symptoms has been shown to be significantly as-
sociated with reduced physical activity and restricted social
contacts (25). Because depression or depressive symptoms
are associated with lack of energy, fatigue, and decreased vi-
tality, individuals with high depressive symptoms may be
less motivated to engage in mobility-related activities. Con-
versely, cognitively impaired individuals with good affect
may be more motivated to engage in physical activities and
other healthy lifestyles. Thus, good emotional health may
moderate the adverse consequences of impaired cognition on
physical health. Ostir and colleagues showed that a high
level of positive emotion was significantly associated with
less ADL disability 2 years later (26).
Further, specific cognitive deficits may interfere with tests
of physical performances such as task-sequencing impair-
ments (apraxia). Hence, persons with low MMSE scores
may be less able to engage in physical and social activities.
This disengagement may also stem from decreased motiva-
tion associated with depressed mood as well as the disabling
effect of specific cognitive deficits on mobility tasks. The
co-occurrence of cognitive and affective impairments further
compromises the adaptive and coping capability of older
persons to environmental and medical stressors. This might
translate into less physical exercise, poor adherence to treat-
ment regimen, and low motivation to engage in other healthy
lifestyles, factors that may moderate subsequent physical de-
cline and scores on lower body performance measures.
There are other possible explanations for how poor cog-
nitive and emotional function at baseline may result in
poorer physical performance. An unrecognized medical
condition, such as a minor stroke, may cause depressive
symptoms or impairment of cognition, which in turn may be
reflected in poorer mobility performance. In this scenario,
cognitive and affective deficits might manifest much earlier,
before demonstrable deficits in physical performance mea-
sures are recognized. Previous studies have demonstrated a
significant association between low cognitive function and
an increased risk of subsequent stroke (27,28). We have no
direct evidence in our study that incident limitations in
physical performance at follow-up are due to stroke or any
specific medical condition known to be associated with de-
pression and impaired cognition.
This study has some limitations. The first is the generaliz-
ability to other populations. For instance, some items on the
CES-D, such as the concepts of happiness, hopefulness, life
enjoyment, and feeling good, may be interpreted differently
in different cultures. However, the relationship between

emotional health and subsequent physical functioning has
not been shown to be different by race or ethnicity (9­
11,25). For example, past studies have reported on the asso-
ciation between high depressive symptoms and increased
risk of subsequent physical decline among older blacks and
whites (9­11). A second limitation is the reliance on self-
reported CES-D measures in cognitively impaired subjects.
However, all subjects included in the analysis had to score
18 or higher on the MMSE, which would remove some of
the potential bias.
Our study has several strengths including its large commu-
nity-based sample, its prospective design, and its use of ob-
jective measures of lower body function. Objective measures
of lower body function have a number of advantages over
self-reports, including increased validity and reproducibility
and less bias from variations in culture, language, mood, cog-
nition, personality, and education level (19,20,29,30).
In conclusion, the present findings showed the independent
and interactive effects of cognitive and emotional status on
subsequent physical disability 2 years later in a large commu-
nity sample of older Hispanics. Multiple approaches are
needed to maintain function in cognitively impaired elders.
One approach is the early recognition and treatment of depres-
sion. Further, community-based programs to promote in-
creased physical activities and intellectual engagements in the
older population, particularly among the cognitively impaired,
merit further study. The results of this study and others may
lay the groundwork for the development of diagnostic and
therapeutic strategies to prevent or delay the onset of cognitive
and physical disability in older Mexican Americans, one of
the fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States.
