Abstract
Objectives: Limited research exists describing youth football injuries, and many of these are confined to
specific regions or communities. The authors describe U.S. pediatric football injury patterns receiving
emergency department (ED) evaluation and compare injury patterns between the younger and older
youth football participants.
Methods: A retrospective analysis of ED data on football injuries was performed using the National
Electronic Injury Surveillance System­All Injury Program. Injury risk estimates were calculated over a
5-year period (2001­2005) using participation data from the National Sporting Goods Associa-
tion. Injury types are described for young (7­11 years) and adolescent (12­17 years) male football
participants.
Results: There were an estimated total of 1,060,823 visits to U.S. EDs for males with football-related
injuries. The most common diagnoses in the younger group (7­11 years) were fracture / dislocation
(29%), sprain / strain (27%), and contusion (27%). In the older group (ages 12­17 years), diagnoses
included sprain / strain (31%), fracture / dislocation (29%), and contusion (23%). Older participants had a
significantly higher injury risk of injury over the 5-year study period: 11.0 (95% confidence interval
[CI] = 9.2 to 12.8) versus 6.1 (95% CI = 4.8 to 7.3) per 1,000 participants / year. Older participants had a
higher injury risk across all categories, with the greatest disparity being with traumatic brain injury
(TBI), 0.8 (95% CI = 0.6 to 1.0) versus 0.3 (95% CI = 0.2 to 0.4) per 1,000 participants / year.
Conclusions: National youth football injury patterns are similar to those previously reported in commu-
nity and cohort studies. Older participants have a significantly higher injury risk, especially with TBI.

American football is a popular sport, with an esti-
mated 11.9 million participants in 2006 and
5 million frequent (40 + days / year) partici-
pants.1 Young and adolescent (ages 7­17 years) football
participants comprise an estimated 53.4% of this total, or
approximately 6.35 million participants.1 Young athletes,
when compared to older athletes, have a higher body
surface­to­mass ratio, open physes, and immature
motor skills, all of which can contribute to greater
injury.2 Injuries in the young athlete can have significant
consequences in later life based on the unique physiol-
ogy of rapidly growing children,3,4 including limb length
discrepancies and early osteoarthritis.5
Previously published research on football injuries has
been primarily focused on injuries of high school6­11 or
collegiate athletes.10,12,13 Several prospective cohort
studies have examined injuries in the youth football
programs of individual communities over one or two
seasons.3,4,14­18 Most of these were smaller studies,
with the largest including 5,128 young football partici-
pants.3 Currently, there is very limited information
about youth football injuries on a national scale.
Furthermore, to our knowledge there are no studies
that directly compare the youngest participants to
adolescent and high school participants. These deficits
are compounded by problems with generalizability due
to large variations in injury reporting between studies.
This is due in part to the challenge of defining what
constitutes an injury in this group.9 The classification

of ``injured participants'' in the literature is varied and
has been defined in terms of the sport (missed all or a
portion of a game or practice), by self-assertion, by
testament of an athletic trainer or coach, or by seeking
medical treatment. Additionally, the amount of expo-
sure has been calculated in varying manners including
any participation, by number of games, by number of
game minutes, or by number of plays. Given the
increasing levels of participation in football and the
lack of nationwide data on youth football injuries, we
examined national injury patterns in youth and adoles-
cent football participants who underwent emergency
department (ED) evaluation and compared injury
patterns of very young participants with those of
adolescents.
METHODS
Study Design
This was an ecologic study design using data from both
the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System­All
Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) and National Sporting
Goods Association (NSGA) for patients treated in U.S.
EDs from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2005.
The Rhode Island Hospital Committee on the Protection
of Human Subjects determined the study protocol to be
exempt from institutional review board review.
Study Setting and Population
Data were obtained from the NEISS-AIP, which is a
collaborative effort between the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Injury Pre-
vention and Control. Data on injury-related visits are
obtained by NEISS-AIP from a national sample of 66
out of 100 NEISS hospitals. This sample is selected by
NEISS-AIP as a stratified probability sample of hospi-
tals in the United States and its territories with a mini-
mum of six beds and a 24-hour ED.19­23 The sample
includes separate strata for very large, large, medium,
and small hospitals and children's hospitals based on
the number of ED visits. NEISS-AIP collects data on ini-
tial visits for all categories of injuries treated in U.S.
EDs and provides data on nearly 500,000 injury-related
ED visits annually. It is intended to provide national
incidence estimates of all categories and external
causes of nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in
U.S. hospital EDs and cannot be used to provide regio-
nal, state, or local estimates.
National Sporting Goods Association's Sports Partici-
pation Program is an annual mailed survey assessing
the number of individuals 7 years of age or older who
participated in different sports within the previous year.
The program has a panel of 300,000 households that is
balanced on a number of characteristics, including
household size, composition, income, age of household
head, and location. From this panel, 20,000 households
are selected each year and mailed a self-administered
questionnaire. In an effort to return a sample that is
representative of the U.S. population, households
selected are balanced with oversampling of lower
``return rate'' segments. Survey response rates average
over 70%.1
Measurements
The NEISS-AIP collects information on the date of
treatment, patient age, diagnosis, body part injured,
patient disposition, locale in which the injury occurred,
and type of sport or product associated with the injury.
Incident locale is coded by NEISS-AIP as home, farm / -
ranch, street or highway, other public property
(includes store, office building, restaurant, church,
hotel, motel, hospital or other medical facility, night-
club, theater, or other public property), mobile home,
industrial place, school, place of recreation or sports,
or not recorded. Football-related injuries were identi-
fied using the NEISS-AIP hierarchical category for
sports injuries and were limited to football (nonsoccer)-
related injuries. For the present study, only injuries that
occurred at school or at a place of recreation or sports
were included. Two age groupings were used for analy-
sis: 7­11 years and 12­17 years. These were intended to
approximate elementary school age and middle / high
school age. Because injury frequencies in female foot-
ball participants were low, analyses involving NEISS
estimates were considered unreliable, and we therefore
performed our analyses using only males. Injury diag-
noses as provided by NEISS-AIP were used, with the
following exceptions: fractures and dislocations were
combined into a single category (``fracture / disloca-
tion''); ``laceration'' was recoded to include the NEISS
categories of lacerations, punctures, and avulsions, and
``contusions / abrasions'' was recoded to include the
NEISS categories contusions / abrasions and hematoma.
We generated a diagnosis category ``traumatic brain
injury'' (TBI) and recoded into that category NEISS-AIP
diagnosis codes for concussion, for internal injury in
which ``head'' was the body part affected and for frac-
ture in which ``head'' was the body part affected.24
Diagnoses other than the leading five diagnoses were
recoded into the ``other'' category.
Injury rates were calculated using participation data
from the Sports Business Research Network1 and are
derived from annual reports provided by the NSGA.
The NSGA conducts annual mail-based surveys of
20,000 preselected U.S. households, collecting self-
reported sports participation data for U.S. residents.
Eligible participants include household members
7 years of age who report participation in tackle foot-
ball at least once during the 12-month period. Data col-
lected include age, sex, and sports participated in
during the previous 12 months. Participation numbers
are grouped into age ranges and include the same age
groups: 7­11 and 12­17 years. These data were avail-
able for the entire study period. The number of foot-
ball-related injuries per 1,000 participants during the
study period was calculated using these participation
data and NEISS-AIP data for 2001­2005.
Data Analysis
Data were analyzed with SAS (Version 9.1.3, SAS Insti-
tute, Inc., Cary, NC) using the survey procedures to
account for the complex sampling design and the
weighting structure utilized by NEISS-AIP. Each case is
assigned a sample weight by NEISS-AIP based on the
inverse probability of selection. These weights were
used to calculate national estimates of nonfatal injuries.
244 Mello et al. · PEDIATRIC FOOTBALL INJURIES
Consistent with the NEISS-AIP recommendations,23 we
designated estimates as unreliable when computations
are based on fewer than 20 NEISS cases (based on un-
weighted data), individual national estimates are less
than 1,200 (based on weighted data), or the coefficient
of variation (CV) of the estimate is greater than 30%.
Injury risk for the 5-year study period was calculated
using the weighted estimates from NEISS-AIP data and
the total participation data in each age group during
the study period and then averaged across all years.
Confidence intervals (CIs) and CVs were calculated by
using a direct variance estimation procedure that
accounted for the sample weights.
RESULTS
From 2001 to 2005, there were an estimated 1,111,917 ED
visits for children aged 7 through 17 years for football-
related injuries occurring at school or sport /
recreation (Table 1). Males represented the large majority
of these injuries (n = 1,060,823). The number of injuries in
male 12- to 17-year-old participants was approximately
four times that of younger participants during the study
period. The overall male injury risk over the 5-year study
period for ages 7­17 was approximately 9.5 per 1,000
participants / year (95% CI = 7.9 to 11.1). The annual
injury risk during the study years for the older partici-
pants group (12­17 years) and the younger participants
(7­11 years) is depicted in Figure 1.
The younger male participants had an injury risk of
approximately 6.1 per 1,000 participants / year (95%
CI = 4.8 to 7.3; Table 2). Fracture was the most common
diagnosis, followed closely by sprain / strain and contu-
sion. Commonly injured body parts in the younger par-
ticipants included arm / hand (43.0%), followed by
leg / foot (23.7%) and head / neck (19.0%).
The overall injury risk over the 5-year study period
for the older male participants' group was 11.0 per
1,000 participants / year (95% CI = 9.2 to 12.8; Table 2).
The most common diagnoses were sprain / strain, frac-
ture, and contusion. The most common body part
injured was arm / hand, with 37.4% of all injuries. Other
common sites of injury included leg / foot (27.4%) and
head / neck (17.4%).
In examining the injury risk ratios of the two groups
(Table 2), the overall injury risk ratio for the 5-year per-
iod between groups was 1.8, with the older age group
demonstrating a higher risk of injury across all types of
injuries. When examining the injuries by ED diagnosis,
older participants were 2.7 times more likely to have a
TBI, almost twice as likely to suffer a strain or sprain
(1.9), and 1.8 times more likely to experience a fracture
when compared with the younger participants. Frac-
ture, which was the leading diagnosis in the younger
group, was replaced by sprain / strain as the leading
diagnosis in the older group. Younger participants had
a higher proportion of arm / hand injuries (43.0% vs.

DISCUSSION
Previous research describing football injuries has been
largely confined to examining cohorts over one or two
seasons, usually from a single community or region. To
our knowledge, our study is the first to use a nationally
representative data set to describe injuries to young
football participants that require ED evaluation and
then compare them to older adolescent football partici-
pants.
Previous research has identified that many injuries
incurred by football participants are minor.3,16 Our
finding that fractures are the most common injury diag-
nosis in the younger age group and second most com-
mon in the older age group most likely reflects the
increased level of acuity with this database of injuries
receiving ED evaluation. It should be noted, however,
that using ED-treated injuries does create some
difficulty in comparing our findings with previous
research on youth football injuries.
Over the 5-year study period, we found that older
youths (ages 12­17 years) appear to have an increasing
annual injury risk, while the younger participants had a
relatively constant injury risk. We do not have an expla-
nation for this, but can speculate that over this 5-year
period, adolescent football participants may have been
at increasing risk of injury due to less conditioning,
increased weight resulting in more force, increased
length of playing seasons, or playing more aggressively
or because of adolescent football rule modifications.
This worrisome trend in the older age group encom-
passes high school football programs, programs that
already have been reported to have the highest injury
rate for high school athletics.25 Additional research will
be needed to determine if this trend continues and
whether more focused analysis for its causative factors
is warranted.
In comparing injury diagnoses in the older group
with the younger group, we found that TBI, sprain /

strain, and fracture / dislocation were significantly more
common in the older age group. This is troublesome
given that TBI and fracture / dislocation are two of the
most serious injury diagnoses. Others have also
reported that increasing age is associated with increas-
ing risk of fracture,17,18 and Shankar et al.10 have noted
that injured high school football participants have a
greater proportion of fractures and concussions than
collegiate football athletes. Furthermore, this is consis-
tent with Powell and Barber-Foss,26 who found that
high school football accounts for the majority (63%) of
mild TBI in all high school athletics.
Arm / hand was the location with the highest propor-
tion of injuries in our study in both age groups. This is
consistent with previous studies of younger partici-
pants,3,14,18,27 but conflicts with the findings of several
high school football studies that reported the lower
extremity to be the most common site.6,7,9­11 Again, this
may reflect the difference in our data set, which
includes only injuries resulting in an ED evaluation, so
does not include injuries treated only on the field.
Our findings support the need for continued efforts in
injury prevention and control directed at youth football.
Radelet et al.27 asserted that ``youth football should be a
priority for injury studies,'' and we concur. Further-
more, these findings suggest the need to direct further
prevention efforts within the sport. Others have made
recommendations regarding mechanisms for reducing
sports injuries including preparticipation physicals,
sporting event medical coverage, adequate training of
coaches, adequate hydration, enforcement of game
rules, and proper equipment.2,28 Although these
approaches have already been used with some success
in football,25,28 these interventions need to be continu-
ally modified and then tested specifically within this age
group to further reduce injury risk in young athletes.
LIMITATIONS
Our estimates of injury involve some potential biases
associated with the use of NEISS-AIP for injury fre-
quency and NSGA's participation data. By examining
NEISS-AIP ED data, we underestimate minor football
injuries that are not treated in an ED setting. Although
these minor injuries have less serious medical conse-
quences, they still may restrict participation, as well as
cause pain. Similarly, other significant injuries might be
evaluated primarily by a specialist or in an office-based
practice or by an on-field physician and not be evalu-
ated in the ED.
The NEISS-AIP allows for only the most severe injury
to be coded in the case of multiple injuries and thus
may underreport less serious injuries. Conversely,
extreme injuries resulting in fatalities are not fully cap-
tured in NEISS-AIP (patients who were dead on arrival
or died in the ED are excluded) and were excluded
from our analysis. Thus, we cannot make any inference
from our data on the incidence of fatal injury occur-
rence in the study population. All of these factors
would lead to an underestimation of the frequency of
injuries and injury rate.
By restricting location codes to school and place of
recreation or sport, we attempted to minimize the
potential for including injuries not occurring in orga-
nized football settings. While it is likely that we never-
theless included some nonorganized football injuries,
and this would lead to overestimation of the problem, it
is also possible that we missed organized football inju-
ries that were not coded as football related. This possi-
bility could offset any overestimation, although we
cannot be sure where the balance lies.
The participation data are a self-reported mail sur-
vey of a nationally representative sample. A participant
was included if reporting participation at least one
time over the past 12 months. Thus, the numbers may
overestimate the number of participants, causing a
bias of underreporting rates. In addition, using the
NSGA's data for participation for participants 7­
17 years in calculating injury rates has the limitation of
not accounting for sampling error. Our denominator
was not considered a random variable; it was assumed
that the denominator was our population parameter
or, simply, our sample size. We recognize that this is
an assumption of utilizing an ecologic study design,
but currently there is no better way to estimate the
number of adolescents playing football in the United
States. All of our analyses were done using visits to
an ED by young and adolescent male football partici-
pants and are not necessarily extrapolated to female
participants in these age groups.
CONCLUSIONS
Our analysis of nationally representative data of foot-
ball injuries treated in EDs is similar to previously
reported findings in communities and cohorts, with
older participants having a significantly higher injury
risk. We found this relationship of increased injury risk
with increasing age to be especially true for the poten-
tially more serious injury diagnoses of TBI and frac-
tures. These results and future research in this area
should be used to guide subsequent injury reduction
measures in this age group.
