Abstract We conducted a prospective and contextual study to examine
the effects of community social-economic-physical distress and
subcultural orientation on mortality following onset of 13
life-threatening diseases in later life. We also examined the
inter-relationship between the effects of community social,
economic and physical distress (i.e. poverty, physical disorder
and low collective efficacy) and subcultural orientation (i.e.
anomie and tolerance of risk behaviour) on the survival chances
of seriously ill older patients. Three data sources were combined
to construct the working sample: 1990 Census data, the 1994­95
PHDCN-CS, and the COSI data. Fifty-one ZIP code areas in
Chicago and 12,672 elderly patients were studied. Community
distress (HR = 1.04; 95% CI = (1.01, 1.07)) and anomie
(HR = 1.26; 95% CI = (1.02, 1.54)) are found to be significantly
and positively associated with a higher hazard of death. Moreover,
community anomie contributes to the effect of community
distress on post-hospitalisation mortality. The social, economic,
physical and cultural environment in which people live appears
to exert a significant impact on whether older people facing
life-threatening illness live or die.

Introduction
Recent interest in how characteristics of place of residence affect the health
of individuals living in the community has generated an abundant literature
Community, subcultural orientations, mortality and older patients 559

that has provided strong evidence for the link between place and health over
and above individual demographic and socioeconomic traits (Blafour and
Kaplan 2002, Browning et al. 2003, Haan et al. 1987, Kawachi and Berkman
2003a, Latkin and Curry 2003, LeClere et al. 1997, 1998, Robert 1998,
Ross 2000). This body of literature has confirmed that both individual and
contextual attributes are important dimensions of social determinants of health,
thereby suggesting a research agenda that simultaneously considers factors
located at different layers of social structure insofar as they influence health.
The bulk of this work has focused on community socioeconomic status
(SES) which is typically measured by the average level of poverty, affluence,
family income, wealth and education of local residents. The major con-
clusion from these studies is that community SES is a significant contextual
determinant of individual mental and physical health, although the effect
of size is relatively smaller than that of individual-level SES (Kawachi and
Berkman 2003b, Pickett and Pearl 2001, Robert 1998, 1999). To a lesser
extent, community social and physical environments have also been exam-
ined as contextual determinants of health in their own right and as pathways
linking community SES to health. Following the hot debate about whether
social capital1 is relevant to individual health outcomes (Chang and Christakis
2005, Kawachi et al. 1997, 1999, Lomas 1998, Lynch 2000, Muntaner and
Lynch 2002), recent empirical investigations that focus on social capital/
social cohesion and health have provided evidence supporting the claim that
social capital, both at the community level and at the state level, has a
significant and positive effect on individual health (Browning and Cagney
2003, Kawachi and Berkman 2000, Kawachi et al. 1999, Lochner et al. 2003,
Veenstra 2002). Moreover, it has been reported that social resources such as
collective efficacy2 and reciprocity, that are present at the neighborhood
level, play a mediating role on the link between contextual economic
resources (e.g. affluence) and health (Wen et al. 2003). Previous work has
also found that poor neighborhoods tend to have more problems of broken
glass or trash on streets and graffiti on buildings, and that these physical
signs of disorder are negatively associated with health (Barr et al. 2001, Ross
and Mirowsky 2001, Wen et al. 2003).
The literature on contextual effects on health has more or less revolved around
these structural, social and physical dimensions of community environment,
whereas other important aspects of community life have been much less
studied. As Macintyre and her colleagues (2003) recently argued, research on
the link between place and health need not be constrained by socioeconomic
and psychosocial factors as studied by social cohesion/social-capital theorists,
but could also incorporate other aspects, including cultural, religious, political
and historical characteristics of residential communities. Indeed, studying
these other aspects of community environment may not only reveal important
yet previously unknown patterns of social ecological influences on health, but
also help to identify mechanisms that can explain the effects of community
SES and social and physical disorders on individual health.

The current investigation is intended to focus on the prospective impact
of community subcultural orientation on mortality in a particularly vulnerable
population ­ older people afflicted with life-threatening diseases. We will
explore the linkages among economic forces, social resources, physical
disorder and cultural factors at the community level and their impacts on
the odds of mortality in later life. Of particular interest is our endpoint that
measures the survival time between the incidence or diagnosis of disease and
death. This outcome affords an excellent opportunity to assess the impact
of contextual factors at a very vulnerable stage of life ­ being old and seriously
ill ­ and also serves the useful purpose of conditioning the effect on a given
health state. By focusing on this special population of older patients, we
attempt to test whether previous evidence on contextual effects can be
expanded into a secondary-prevention population with known life-threatening
diseases. We will also specifically examine whether tolerance of risk behaviours
and prevailing values and beliefs as measures of community subcultural
orientation exert prospective and contextual effects on mortality, and whether
these subcultural patterns help explain the effects of community economic,
social and physical environments on health.
Theoretical and empirical background
Poverty, low collective efficacy and physical disorder
Poverty is the key source of many social problems. The early work of the
Chicago school urban sociologists suggested that economic problems were often
spatially clustered with other social problems involving crime, delinquency,
mental disorders and physical illness (Faris and Dunham 1960, Shaw and
McKay 1969). Arguably, a place seriously deficient in economic resources
may have a problem of sustaining good physical conditions, adequate health
services, efficient social institutions (e.g. family, church, sports clubs and
other voluntary associations) and adequate local employment opportunities.
Thus, individuals who reside in poor areas are likely to suffer from daily
stress and ill health.
A sophisticated literature has consistently described the deleterious effect
of community poverty on health even after controlling for individual
characteristics (Barr et al. 2001, Haan et al. 1987, Yen and Kaplan 1999). In
other words, this work finds that community poverty contextually and
sometimes prospectively increases one's risks for poor health or death, and
this relationship is not completely confounded or mediated by individual
SES and other socio-demographic factors.
The protective effect of social resources at the community level has also
been documented. For example, a recent study finds multilevel evidence
that individuals residing in Chicago neighbourhoods with higher levels of
collective efficacy report better overall health (Browning and Cagney 2002).
Another Chicago-based study also shows that community social capital ­ as
Community, subcultural orientations, mortality and older patients 561

measured by reciprocity, trust and civic participation ­ was associated with
lower community death rates, after adjustment for community material de-
privation (Lochner et al. 2003). Beyond the social capital/collective-efficacy
perspective, institutional theories emphasise the role that schools, businesses,
political organisations and social services play in the community (Crane 1991).
Not surprisingly, poverty and social and physical environments at the
community level are linked. Ross and Mirowsky (2001) conducted a study
examining whether living in a disadvantaged Census tract damaged health,
and whether community social and physical disorder mediated the asso-
ciation. They constructed an index of objective community disadvantage
that measured physical signs of disorder such as graffiti and abandoned
buildings, as well as negative social signs such as crime and people drinking
or using drugs. They found that residents of disadvantaged communities
had worse self-reported health and physical functioning and more chronic
conditions than residents of more advantaged neighbourhoods. Furthermore,
the association was mediated entirely by perceived community physical and
social disorder and the resulting fear.
The link between poverty and a low stock of social resources in the
community has been illuminated long ago in Shaw and McKay's social dis-
organisation theory (Shaw and McKay 1969). A central premise of this
model is that structural barriers such as poverty impede development of the
formal and informal ties that promote the ability to solve common problems
(Sampson and Groves 1989). Although later evidence shows that poor urban
areas can be tightly integrated with extensive patterns of social interaction
(Glass and Balfour 2003, Stack 1974, Wen et al. 2005), it is possible that
the capacity to achieve common goals among persons living in impoverished
neighbourhoods (i.e. collective efficacy) is low, given that they may have
limited means to support each other.
Community distress signalled by poverty, physical disorder and low
collective efficacy may affect health via multiple mechanisms. It is plausible
that, as an integral component of our social contexts, community milieu
affects individual psychosocial experiences involving stress processes and
behavioural patterns that directly affect health. Meanwhile, the social and
economic disorganisation may nurture a lost sense of community, negative
community identification and aberrant behaviours (Wilson 1987). The
ensuing departure from mainstream patterns amounts to a set of norms,
values, orientations and aspirations that are likely to be negative and health-
compromising.
Culture-of-poverty model and the epidemic theory
Here Oscar Lewis's culture-of-poverty arguments on the ghetto underclass
may shed light on how community social and structural distress may affect
its cultural characteristics which have direct bearings on individual health
lifestyles that inevitably affect health (Lewis 1968). Lewis defined the culture
of poverty as `both an adaptation and a reaction of the poor to their marginal
562 Ming Wen and Nicholas A. Christakis

position in a class-stratified, highly individuated, capitalistic society' (Lewis
1968: 188). He argued that the culture of poverty `tends to perpetuate itself
from generation to generation because of its effect on the children. By the
time slum children are age six or seven, they have usually absorbed the basic
values and attitudes of their subculture and are not psychologically geared
to take full advantage of changing conditions or increased opportunities which
may occur in their life-time' (1968: 188). Here it is important to note that
Lewis also realised and explicated that culture of poverty is structurally
rooted and structural changes in society (e.g. redistributing wealth) can lead
to modifications of the basic characteristics of the culture of poverty.
In other words, the culture-of-poverty perspective postulates that the poor
who reside in areas plagued by poverty and social problems, by virtue of
their exclusion from mainstream society and their social isolation from
positive role models, develop a lifestyle that is by nature different from that
of the middleclass societies in which they live and that assumes a `life of
its own', that is passed across generations through cultural transmission
(Steinberg 1989, Wilson 1991, 1996). This model is essentially consistent
with the contagion or epidemic theory suggesting that people's behaviours
are influenced by the norms, values, orientations and aspirations of those
around them, and spread through peer influence (Crane 1991, Robert 1999).
Living in distressed communities and being neighboured by other disad-
vantaged people, therefore, enhance ones exposure to health-compromising
attitudes and behaviours. And, at least in part, it is through the spread of
negative attitudes and risky behaviours that poverty and social dislocations
are transferred to poor health in the community.
In this theoretical stream, the emphasis on anomic attitudes and deviant
behaviour echoes and expands earlier intellectual traditions on the concept
of anomie (Orrù 1987). Durkheim was perhaps the first to introduce the
anomie concept into sociology and used the concept to explain deviant
behaviour (Durkheim 1933, 1951). Durkheim's concept of anomie was
developed in the The Division of Labor (1933) and further elaborated in
Suicide (1951). He was concerned with the inadequacy of socially generated
goals and values in industrial societies and the consequent destructive
individual behaviours due to the lack of normative guidance (Orrù 1989).
He used the concept of anomie to describe the erosion of standards and
values characteristic of cultural or normative disorder that results from the
lack of societal regulation (for whatever reasons). One consequence of this
normative disorder or anomie in a society or community is what Durkheim
labelled as `anomic suicide'. Building on Durkheim's work, Merton later modi-
fied the anomie concept and described the consequences of an instrumental
imbalance between cultural values and social norms and the ensuing condition
where norms lost their regulatory power for the individual (Merton 1938,
Orrù 1989). He thus incorporated the disjunction between cultural goals and
socially structured opportunity into the anomie framework (Cloward 1959).
The conception of anomie was further broadened by Leo Srole who not only
Community, subcultural orientations, mortality and older patients 563

explicitly specified five dimensions of the anomie concept but also conceived
his anomie scale and tested the scale in his own study (Srole 1956). While
Srole admitted that his operational formulation of the anomie concept was
preliminary and rather simplistic, the Srole anomia scale has proved to be
useful in applied research related to the anomie concept (Bullough 1967,
Wilson 1971). Although these theorists emphasised different aspects and
conditions of anomie, all shared the view that the core component of anomie is
normlessness or a departure from the dominant mainstream culture. They
also have all argued or implied that the ensuing feelings of alienation in an
anomic society or community are likely to foster maladaptive, antisocial and
high-risk behaviour that inevitably compromises health in the long run.
Another version of this view that emphasises the link between anomic
attitudes and deviant behaviour is epitomised in the subcultural transmission
model. This model suggests that subcultures display distinctive health lifestyles,
with specific beliefs, knowledge and attitudes conditioning risk-taking
behaviour and health (Fitzpatrick and Lagory 2000). In some insulated and
deprived places, therefore, where long-term poverty, low labour force par-
ticipation, out-of-wedlock childbearing, school drop-out, welfare dependency
and other social problems prevail, deviant role models emerge and encourage
health-destructive behaviours such as use of illegal drugs and violence
(Wilson 1987, 1991, 1996). Similarly, attitudinal problems may also result
from racial and economic segregation, limited opportunities and little hope
for upward mobility. For example, feelings of alienation, powerlessness, fatalism
and cynicism are likely to result from previous experiences of denial and exploi-
tation that are potentially hazardous to health, as they may be correlated
with recognised pre-disease pathways in individuals such as stress (Thoits
1995) and social isolation (Cacioppo et al. 2002).
In all, a common theme that emanates from these differently labelled
theories (i.e. culture-of-poverty perspective, contagion or epidemic model and
subcultural transmission model) is that community economic deprivation is
complexly intertwined with social disorganisations and physical disorders;
and, the combined social-structural distress nurtures deviant cultural char-
acteristics that inevitably expose the inhabitants to health-detrimental
psychosocial hazards which tend to precipitate the ageing process and to
cause morbidity and premature mortality.
Health lifestyles and ecological `habitus'
Health lifestyles are important psychosocial factors that have been theorised
and corroborated as important pathways linking social contexts with health
(Williams 1990). Health lifestyles have been defined as collective modes of
health-related consumption involving choices in diet, leisure, activity, health-
care use and other forms of behaviour, and are based on options available
to people according to their life chances reflected in variables such as age,
gender, race, ethnicity, social networks and SES (Cockerham and Ritchey
1997). It has long been recognised that one's life chances, largely determined
564 Ming Wen and Nicholas A. Christakis

by one's structural position in the social hierarchy, shape the choices that
people can make (Weber 1978). The relationship between social class and
health lifestyles in France has been thoroughly studied by the French
sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (1984). According to Bourdieu, habitus, or a
class-based set of durable dispositions to act in particular ways, results from
upstream social structure and shapes an individual's cultural tastes and styles
so as to correspond to his or her social position. In the US, given the fact that
poverty and affluence have been more and more concentrated spatially in
large cities over the last three decades (Massey 1996), place of residence can
be viewed as an extended marker of one's structural position in society. Indeed,
it can be argued that health lifestyles are spatially patterned and inextricably
entangled with the spatial distribution of structural resources.
Although research that empirically examines the link between the health
subculture of a residential community and the health of individual residents
is extremely rare, some evidence shows that community collective features
are important to individual health behaviours. For example, Yen and Kaplan
(1998) found that area characteristics such as lighting, amount of criminal
activity and access to recreational facilities could influence physical activity
levels. In addition to Yen and Kaplan's (1999) finding that local poverty
prospectively predicted decline in physical activity, a recent study (Craig et
al. 2002) using Canadian data found that a composite score of community
environment, based on 18 community characteristics (e.g. variety of destina-
tions, visual aesthetics and traffic), was positively associated with walking
to work, both with and without adjustment for degree of urbanisation. Another
study, drawing on ecological theory, examined the association among partic-
ipation in regular vigorous exercise, social status and aspects of prominent
life settings, including contextual factors at the community level (Grzywacz
and Marks 2001). These analyses indicated that respondents who perceived
their neighbourhoods as safer participated in more regular and vigorous
exercise than individuals in less safe communities. Other health behaviours
have also been examined in their relation to residential environment. Lee
and Cubbin (2002) examined whether community characteristics were asso-
ciated with cardiovascular health behaviours independently of individual
characteristics. The results showed that low SES and high community social
disorganisation were independently associated with poorer dietary habits,
while high community Hispanic concentration and urbanicity were associ-
ated with healthier dietary habits. While this study did not show significant
associations between community characteristics and physical activity or
smoking, two other studies have found prominent effects of community SES
on smoking behaviours. One study found that deprivation of the area of
residence remained a significant predictor of smoking status even after the
socioeconomic group of the individual had been taken into account (Klein-
schmidt et al. 1995). The other study found that the age- and gender-adjusted
prevalence of smoking was higher in deprived urban areas and that the
SES of residents could only partially explain this effect (Reijneveld 1998).
Community, subcultural orientations, mortality and older patients 565

Evidence also shows that community deprivation, perhaps partially through
exerting environmental stress, increases one's likelihood of drug use even
after controlling for individual socio-demographic characteristics (Boardman
et al. 2001).
These empirical studies demonstrate that individual health lifestyles are
surely affected by community social and structural characteristics, which
make it a plausible hypothesis that community subcultural orientation cor-
responds to social, economic and physical aspects of community environments,
and influences individual choices of health promoting or compromising
consumption that eventually affect health. Even if we may suspect that
healthy or risky behaviours have a larger impact on the onset of disease than
on the outcome, it is reasonable to expect that lifestyles as manifest in diet,
exercise, smoking, alcohol use and utilisation of preventive healthcare are
still important factors that would affect disease progression to death among
seriously ill older adults.
Conceptual framework
Based on these theoretical considerations and empirical findings, Figure 1
shows a conceptual model that guides our empirical analyses. We focus on
concentrated poverty as a socioeconomic marker, collective efficacy as an
indicator of health-promoting social resources and physical disorder as a
measure of local physical environment. We examine two aspects of subcul-
tural orientation ­ anomic attitudes and tolerance for risk behaviours ­ in
terms of their impact on health and role in the pathway from community
distress to health. Health is objectively indexed by mortality after the onset
of serious illness in older life. Acknowledging additional individual-level
Figure 1 Conceptual model
566 Ming Wen and Nicholas A. Christakis

pathways linking place with health, this model postulates that concentrated
poverty, low collective efficacy and physical disorder are bundled together
constituting community distress that fosters a sense of anomie and raises the
level of tolerance for risky behaviour in the community which exacerbates
already existing medical conditions among seniors, accelerates the health
deteriorating process and increases mortality.
Methods
Data
Three data sources were used to construct the working sample in this study:
the 1990 Census data, the 1994­95 Project on Human Development in Chicago
Neighborhoods-Community Survey (PHDCN-CS), and the Care after the
Onset of Serious Illness (COSI) dataset.
ZIP code level poverty rate was obtained from the 1990 Census and was
used as a structural marker of community conditions. The benefit of using
a single variable versus a composite index to indicate community economic
condition is that it is conceptually clear and methodologically simple.
Measures of community physical environment (physical disorder), social
resources (collective efficacy) and cultural characteristics (tolerance for risk
behaviour, anomie) were constructed from the PHDCN-CS (Sampson et al.
1997). The PHDCN-CS is a probability sample of 8,782 residents of
Chicago focusing on respondent assessments of the communities in which
they live. Each record in the PHDCN-CS data was identified by a Census
tract in Chicago. Using geographic centroids of Census tracts, we linked
each Census tract with its corresponding ZIP code area. On average, there
were 293 PHDCN-CS respondents per ZIP code.
The core data of COSI are rooted in the 1993 inpatient hospitalisation
records from the Health Care Financing Administration's Medicare pro-
gram (Christakis and Iwashyna 2003, Christakis et al. 2002, Iwashyna et al.
2002). The COSI data set consists of a cohort of patients newly diagnosed
in 1993 with one of 13 serious illnesses and followed for up to six years. The
13 diseases were selected because they met several COSI conceptual criteria
including accuracy of ascertainment and high prevalence. Prior detailed
empirical work provided guidance to capture incident cases of disease based
on incident hospitalisations. Detailed descriptions of how COSI data were
constructed have been published elsewhere (Christakis et al. 2002).
ZIP codes were available for subjects in the COSI data and were used to
define neighbourhoods and to link the three data sources into one
merged file. Although ZIP code boundaries do not perfectly circumscribe
neighbourhoods, they do represent local residential areas and they are
frequently used in studies of neighbourhoods (Finch et al. 1999, Lipton and
Gruenewald 2002, Merkin et al. 2002, Zwanziger et al. 2002). We studied
12,672 patients from COSI residing in 51 ZIP code areas in Chicago.
Community, subcultural orientations, mortality and older patients 567

Geo-coding to smaller levels of aggregation (e.g. Census tracts) was not
possible because of data limitations.
Dependent variable
Our health outcome was the relative hazard of death for COSI cohort mem-
bers. The survival time was defined as the number of days from the date of
the index hospitalisation for the onset of his/her disease to death or to the
end of the study (i.e. 30 June 1999). People who were still alive on 30 June
1999 were right censored.
Independent variables
At the individual level: Individual demographic and baseline health measures
(used as controls in the analyses) include age, gender, race (non-white or
white), three continuous comorbidity scores based on healthcare use in the
three years prior to the index hospitalisation3, and a dichotomous indicator
of Medicaid recipient at any point in 1993 as a proxy measure of individual
income status (poverty). Table 1 illustrates characteristics of COSI patients in
Chicago. The average age of this cohort is about 79 with 13 per cent of them
receiving Medicaid in 1993. The majority are white and 32 per cent are
non-white, most of whom are African Americans and Latinos. For the
COSI cohort, stroke (23%) and congestive heart failure (24%) are the most
common conditions among the diseases studied.
At the community level: Following Browning and Cagney (2003), health-
related subcultural orientations were captured with two scales, a measure of
tolerance for youthful deviance and problem behaviours and a measure of
detachment from conventional norms (anomie). Tolerance for risk behaviour
was measured by four items. Respondents were asked their opinions regarding
how wrong it was for teenagers around 19 years old to smoke cigarettes, use
marijuana, drink alcohol and get into fistfights. Anomie was tapped by a
five-point Likert scale asking respondents' agreement with the following
statements: 1) `Laws were made to be broken', 2) `It's okay to do anything you
want as long as you don't hurt anyone', 3) `To make money, there are no right
and wrong ways any more, only easy ways and hard ways', and 4) `Fighting
between friends or within families is nobody else's business'. Corresponding
to Durkheim's original conception of the concept of anomie (Durkheim
1933, 1951), this scale is intended to capture detachment from conventional
norms and fatalistic orientations that may increase the likelihood of health-
risk behaviour (Browning and Cagney 2003, Sampson and Bartusch 1998).
Following the operationalisation of Sampson et al. (1997), the collective
efficacy scale was constructed through combining items of social cohesion
and informal social control. Social cohesion items from the PHDCN-CS
assessed the respondent's level of agreement (on a five-point scale) with the
following statements: 1) `People around here are willing to help their neighbors',
2) `This is a close-knit neighborhood', 3) `People in this community can be
trusted', 4) `People in this community generally don't get along with each
568 Ming Wen and Nicholas A. Christakis

other', and 5) `People in this community do not share the same values'. The
last two items were reverse coded. Health-related informal social control
was tapped through respondents' level of agreement with the following
statement: `You can count on adults in this community to watch out that
children are safe and don't get into trouble'. An additional informal control
item asked respondents how likely it was that people in their community
would intervene if a fight broke out in front of their house. Social cohesion
and informal social control were closely correlated across ZIP code areas
(r = 0.92, p < 0.0001). The higher the value in the collective efficacy scale,
the more the stock of collective efficacy present in the community.
Physical disorder was represented by a three-item Likert-type scale in the
PHDCN-CS. Residents were asked about the extent of problems stemming
from litter, broken glass or trash on the sidewalks and streets; of graffiti on
buildings and walls; of vacant or deserted houses or shopfronts. Responses

to the items were aggregated to the community level as initial measures. The
three items were highly correlated across neighbourhoods. They were
subsequently combined into a composite measure, with higher scores indi-
cating higher levels of physical disorder.
Community Poverty was measured by the percentage of households that
were living in poverty (a household annual income of less than US$13,359
for a household of four in 1990). Community poverty, as a marker of
spatially based social position, goes hand in hand with physical disorder
(r = 0.81; p < 0.001) while being negatively correlated with collective efficacy
(r = -0.68; p < 0.001). By contrast, the two cultural variables are not
significantly associated with poverty. Relative to anomie, tolerance for risk
behaviour is more correlated with poverty although the correlation is not
statistically significant at the five per cent level (r = 0.21; p = 0.15). Mean-
while, it is significantly linked to collective efficacy (r = -0.39; p < 0.05) and
physical disorder (p = 0.23; p < 0.10). Table 2 shows the correlation matrix
of these five measures of community environment.
To better understand the relationships among these community factors, we
performed factor analyses to identify the latent structure underlying the five
variables at the community level examined in this study. These analyses show
that physical disorder, poverty and collective efficacy are tightly clustered
around a dominant factor, whereas tolerance for risk behaviour and anomie
appear conspicuously distinct. Factor loadings for poverty, collective efficacy
and physical disorder are 0.83, -0.83 and 0.93 respectively. We then constructed
a single factor score as a composite measure of general community social, eco-
nomic and physical environment. The community distress scale has a satisfactory
internal reliability (the coefficient alpha is 0.76). We label this composite
measure as `community distress', which is positively correlated with high poverty,
low collective efficacy and high level of physical disorder in the community.
Analytical strategy
Following the ecometric method assessing ecological settings illustrated in
the work of Raudenbush and Sampson (1999), we used HLM-adjusted

empirical Bayes' residuals as measures of community collective efficacy,
physical disorder, tolerance of risky behaviour and anomie. The major advantage
of this approach to measuring community characteristics based on survey
data is that ecological measures thus constructed are simultaneously adjusted
for item-specific factors (e.g. severity), response bias, different sample size
within each ecological unit and random errors specific to each community.
After data construction, we fit a series of Cox proportional hazards
models to test the effects of community characteristics on individual hazard
of death among the elderly patients in the COSI data set. The Huber-White
robust method of calculating the variance-covariance matrix is used to
account for the possible correlation in survival experiences among patients
living within the same ZIP code area (Lin and Wei 1989). The proportionality
assumption of Cox models was tested to examine the sensitivity of findings
from non-stratified Cox models to the violation of the proportionality assumption.
No meaningful violation of the proportionality assumption was detected.
Results
Table 3 shows the results of six Cox proportional hazards models that examine
the effects of community distress, anomie and tolerance for risk behaviours
on mortality and the mediating role of subcultural orientation in the link
between community distress and the hazards of death among elderly
patients. First, we find that community physical, social and economic distress
prospectively and contextually increases the mortality risk of individuals
after diagnosis (model 3.1). Living in a community with one unit higher level
of distress is associated with four per cent higher risk of mortality after
onset of serious disease in this elderly patient population, controlling for
individual poverty status, age, gender, race, baseline comorbidity and diagnosis.
The magnitude of this community effect can be understood more intuitively
by comparison with the mortality effect of individual attributes. For exam-
ple, according to model 1 in Table 3, the difference in the relative hazard of
death between two sub-populations which differ by one unit in community
distress is approximately equivalent to the difference that would be gener-
ated by a 10-month age difference at the individual level.
Second, a measure of anomie at the community level significantly predicts
higher rate of mortality for older patients with serious diseases in addition
to several personal characteristics (model 3.2). Living in a community with
one unit higher level of anomie is associated with 26 per cent higher risk of
mortality in this elderly patient population regardless of individual risk fac-
tors. Tolerance for risk behaviour also exerts a positive effect on mortality
but the magnitude of the effect is not statistically significant (model 3.3).
Third, the data also show that community distress can be partially explained
by the contextual impact of anomie. After adding anomie to model 3.1, the
effect of community distress decreases by about 18 per cent but remains

significant at the five per cent level (model 3.4). Similarly, adding commu-
nity distress to model 3.2 reduces the anomie effect by nearly 20 per cent
which is now only marginally significant at the 10 per cent level (model 3.4).
Fourth, both model 3.5 and model 3.6 show that tolerance of risky behav-
iours is not an important mechanism underlying the contextual effect of
community distress on mortality. The effect of community distress remains
virtually unchanged with tolerance of risky behaviours added to the model.
In summary, the key message conveyed by Table 3 is that the overall level
of community economic, social and physical distress exercises a strong
impact of increasing the odds among older people of dying from medical
conditions, and community subcultural orientation manifest in anomic
attitudes seems to play a mediating role in this association. It is also note-
worthy that the effects of individual risk factors are consistent across all
the models. Age, male gender, poverty and co-existing morbidity are all
significant risk factors of mortality. The coefficients of diagnosis reveal that
relative to acute myocardial infarction (MI; the reference diagnosis), stroke
has a comparable effect on the hazard of death, congestive heart failure has a
stronger mortality force, most cancers have yet stronger effects on mortality,
and hip fracture appears to be the least fatal condition among the 13 diseases
examined.
Summary and discussion
In this prospective and contextual study, we examined four dimensions of
community environments, comprising physical disorder, social resources,
economic deprivation and subcultural orientation in terms of their con-
textual effects on mortality risk following diagnosis with various serious
conditions in an elderly population in Chicago. We found that a dominant
latent factor underlies physical disorder, collective efficacy and poverty. An
encompassing composite index was then constructed to measure the level of
community distress and was subsequently used to test our conceptual model
(see Figure 1). The theoretical framework received broad empirical support.
The conclusion that we can draw is that community distress and the
amount of anomie present in the community (a contextual subcultural
factor) exert powerful contextual forces affecting the mortality risk among
elderly patients, in addition to individual risk factors. By contrast, we found
no effect of the level of tolerance for risk behaviours on the mortality of
elderly people stricken with debilitating illnesses. When we set off to test the
mortality effect of subcultural orientation, we explicitly focused on deviant
attitudes in general and views on risk behaviours in particular, as two
important dimensions of community subculture. The anomie scale was
intended to tap the first dimension and the tolerance for risk behaviour scale
was orientated to capturing the latter. Recall of the tolerance for risk behav-
iour scale was based on respondents' opinions regarding how wrong it was

for teenagers to engage in risk behaviours. It is possible that this measure is
primarily based on views about teenage risk behaviour and therefore is less
relevant for older and diseased adults. Or, perhaps more likely, norms of
healthy or risky behaviour at the community level have indeed a more
preventive function and are less crucial for elderly people who have already
been afflicted with serious diseases, even if at the individual level lifestyles
may still be relevant for health at this stage of life. On the other hand, the
level of anomie, which may reflect a certain degree of cynicism, fatalism and
`present-time-consumption' that spread across the community, appears to
have a strong impact on the hazard of death contextually as well as prospec-
tively in this elderly population with serious illnesses.
Following the findings of significant effects of community distress and
subculture, we further examined whether the effect of community distress
was mediated through subcultural orientation as measured by the level of
anomie and the tolerance for risk behaviours in the community. Our data
show that the two types of community forces, social-structural distress and
subculture, are inter-related yet clearly distinct from each other. Although
their effects on mortality can each be understood by the other to some
degree, they have unique or independent impacts on mortality which are
perhaps channelled through alternative pathways. This finding confirms the
hypothesis put forward in the conceptual model (Figure 1), that is, that
community social-economic-physical distress affects mortality in part via
subcultural orientation. However, additional mechanisms probably exist
through other community ecological processes and/or individual pathways
that are not examined in this study.
The conclusion that community subcultural orientation plays a significant
role in the link between residential community distress and health may be
provocative. This evidence essentially lends support to the culture-of-poverty
perspective that stresses the unhealthy subcultures in marginalised social
groups and poor urban communities in explaining the so-called `ghetto'
problems, as well as individual disadvantage. Critics of the culture-of-
poverty thesis argue that it places blame on the victim no matter whether at
the individual level or community level and hence clouds the social causes
of poverty; believers in this view may therefore erroneously favour social
policies that aim to indoctrinate the poor with mainstream values over those
more expensive and painful policies that promote structural changes in
resource allocation (Steinberg 1989). Clearly, it is not appropriate to assume
that cultural patterns spontaneously evolve without being inextricably
tied up with the social structure. As Oscar Lewis noted in his original con-
ception of the culture-of-poverty perspective, `by creating basic structural
changes in society, by redistributing wealth, by organizing the poor and
giving them a sense of belonging, of power and of leadership, revolutions
frequently succeed in abolishing some of the basic characteristics of the
culture of poverty even when they do not succeed in curing poverty itself'
(Lewis 1966: 9).

On the other hand, as argued long ago by Ulf Hannerz (1969) and reiter-
ated by William Julius Wilson (1991), it is not enough to recognise the
importance of macrostructural constraints; it is also imperative to see `the
merits of a more subtle kind of cultural analysis of life in poverty' (Hannerz
1969). Wilson (1991) further argued that simplistic either/or notions of
`culture versus social structure' have impeded the development of a broader
theoretical context that can be used to examine questions regarding life
in urban deprived neighbourhoods. He also presented a framework that
integrates social structural and cultural arguments in an attempt to depict
the sources as well as processes of social dislocations in inner-city ghettos.
This framework finds some empirical support in the current research, show-
ing that community subcultural orientation (i.e. anomie) does play a role in
linking poor neighbourhoods with poor health.
It is equally important, however, to recognise that although poor places
tend to have health-compromising subcultures and social problems, not all
poor places have become `ghettos' (Wilson 1971), and some communities,
despite suffering from economic deficiency, may yet manage well in
maintaining the mainstream values or social functioning, and, in doing so,
alleviate the deleterious effect of structural disadvantage. These communities
are probably uncommon, but their experiences would be particularly informative
to policy makers and researchers who are concerned with health disparities
across social groups. Further quantitative and qualitative research is needed
to elucidate the processes through which some impoverished communities
protect their residents against health hazards better than their peers of similar
poverty level. Data from in-depth ethnographic field work may provide some
answers to questions such as `What are the circumstances, apart from or
in conjunction with affluence, that impel a community to mobilise an
efficient apparatus to instill positive cultural values into the residents and
successfully maintain social order?'. Such research would potentially narrow
the knowledge gap in the relationship between community subcultural
orientation and the residents'physical and mental health. Some cultural orientations
are not exclusively rooted in the unequal distribution of resources. Future work
should extend research by investigating other cultural aspects in the commu-
nity, such as health values and attitudes toward health services, that may be
embedded in the community's ethnic and minority background.
In sum, the general findings from this research are strongly supportive of
the perspective that community contextual effects extend to later life. Theory
suggests that community effect should be stronger for elderly people because
they tend to be less mobile, spend more time in the neighbourhood and be
more vulnerable and/or attached to their neighbourhoods than younger people
(Diez-Roux 2002, Glass and Balfour 2003). Empirical evidence, however, is
at most mixed about this posited age pattern in the neighbourhood-health
link, with more studies in fact finding non-significant or less significant
community effect (SES) among elderly adults (Anderson et al. 1997, Haan
et al. 1987, Waitzman and Smith 1998). It has been argued that inadequate
576 Ming Wen and Nicholas A. Christakis

measures of community environment may be one reason for the seemingly
reduced community effects in older persons (Glass and Balfour 2003). Using
multiple measures of the community environment, our study reinforces the
idea that the social, economic, physical and cultural environments of
residential community are relevant dimensions of social causation of mortality
in later life.
Here it is noteworthy that our measures of anomie and tolerance for risk
behaviour are aggregated survey-based assessments of individual attitudes
and are rather exploratory. To efficiently identify anomie in the community,
we focused on the key dimension of the anomie concept ­ values and attitudes
deviant from the dominant culture. In fact, this component of anomie,
perhaps most closely approximating Durkheim's original conception of
anomie, is also reflected in the item standing for the deflation of internalised
social norms and values in the original Srole anomia scale (Srole 1956).
While we did not adopt the Srole anomia scale to operationalise the anomie
concept, two items in the anomia scale might be incorporated into our
anomie scale in the future as a measure of detachment from conventional
norms. One item captures the sense of orderlessness, with the agree-disagree
statement `Nowadays a person has to live pretty much for today and let
tomorrow take care of itself'. The other item directly taps normlessness and
meaninglessness, with the statement `It's hardly fair to bring children into
the world with the way things look for the future'. There are certainly other
attitudinal statements that are potentially useful for constructing a differen-
tiating measure of anomie. It is hoped that in future research more effective
measurement of anomie will be conceived, constructed and validated
through concerted qualitative and quantitative efforts in formulating the
applications of the anomie concept. More work also needs to be done to
refine the measurement of tolerance for risk behaviours at the community
level. Situational measures that are more relevant to our study population ­
older adults with serious illness ­ may yield different findings.
Several strengths of this study merit comment. Using different data sources
to measure community environment (i.e. the 1990 Census data and the
PHDCN-CS) and to capture individual risk factors and health event (the
COSI) minimises method-induced associations between outcomes and
predictors. Our outcome measure, the hazard of death, was objective. The study
was prospective and population-based. Moreover, we tested the prospective and
contextual effect of an under-researched aspect of community life ­ subcul-
tural orientation ­ on mortality following serious illnesses in the late stage of the
lifecourse, and further revealed the mediating role of cultural characteristics
(i.e. anomie) in the link between community physical, social and economic
disadvantage and the hazard of death among elderly urban patients.
The research would be strengthened by a true longitudinal design, however.
Without time-varying information on individual residence (only ZIP code at
the origin of the study was available for the COSI cohort) we cannot examine
how residential mobility affects our findings. Presumably, some people moved
Community, subcultural orientations, mortality and older patients 577

between their initial diagnosis and their death. Failure to take this issue into
account may result in bias due to exposure misspecification. The direction
of this bias is not clear, however, because of variation in the possible causes
of residential moves. Future investigation equipped with longitudinal data
both at the individual level and community level should be able to better explore
this issue. Another data limitation concerns the lack of individual-level con-
trols. For example, we did not control for education which is clearly related
to one's residence as well as health, and our measure for individual income
was crude and only based on a dichotomous indicator of Medicaid recipient.
Nevertheless, we controlled for diagnosis in 1993 at the index of hospitalisa-
tion and comorbidity status for the three preceding years. It is arguable that
these health outcomes are largely reflective of one's social-demographic back-
ground and can be viewed as complementary to other individual-level risk factors.
Finally, we want to mention that this study is Chicago-based and designed
for a vulnerable subgroup of the population ­ people who are old and
ill. It would be interesting to see if the main findings are replicable for other
populations in other urban or rural settings. Our knowledge of social deter-
minants of health would be further enhanced by finding specific patterns
of community effects for different subgroups on a variety of health outcomes.
In conclusion, this research finds evidence supporting the prospective and
contextual effect of the social, economic, physical and cultural environment
of local communities on the survival experiences of older people facing life
threatening illness. It appears that reducing poverty, regaining community
collective efficacy, controlling physical disorder and redirecting subcultural
orientation via, say, providing role models and adequate institutional
support, may help regenerate disadvantaged neighbourhoods and benefit the
health of local residents.

Notes
1 Social capital has diverse definitions according to different theorists of social
capital (Bourdieu 1986, Coleman 1988, Putnam et al. 1993). Nonetheless, it can
578 Ming Wen and Nicholas A. Christakis

be generalised from these definitions that social capital generally refers to social
resources (e.g. trust and reciprocity) that are accumulated through social
networking (dense or loose), shared among members of some social structures
(yet differentially accessible to individuals), and potentially facilitating collective
actions to fulfil commonly recognised goals.
2 Sampson and his colleagues (1997) have recently developed `collective efficacy' as
a related social ecological concept in their study of neighbourhood effects on
crime. Essentially collective efficacy is a subsumed notion of social capital, which
has been defined as `social cohesion among neighbours combined with their
willingness to intervene on behalf of the common good' (Sampson et al. 1997).
This notion emphasises two important dimensions of social capital­social solidarity
and informal social control. In physical setting, it emphasises the willingness and
ability of neighbourhoods to act collectively in order to realise the common goals
of residents. According to the collective efficacy theory, high collective capacity
is achieved not necessarily through the existence of dense local civic networks
but mainly through the agreed collectivism manifest in a community's cohesive
culture and in the informally controlled normative behaviours of its residents
(Morenoff et al. 2001, Sampson et al. 1997).
3 Comorbidity is measured by the Charlson method (Charlson et al. 1987), which
is extremely popular and has been used extensively in claims data research
(Christakis et al. 2002, Iwashyna et al. 2002). Having examined the effects of
alternative data sources and lookback periods on the performance of Charlson
scores in the prediction of mortality following hospitalisation, Zhang et al. (1999)
have found that, compared with a one-year lookback involving solely inpatient
claims, statistically and empirically significant improvements in the prediction
of mortality were obtained by incorporating alternative sources of data (par-
ticularly two years of inpatient data and one year of outpatient and auxiliary
claims), but only if they were entered into the regression simultaneously.
Although they parameterised the Charlson score as indicator variables, they also
tested a linear, continuous specification of the Charlson score and found by and
large the same patterns. In our sample, three years of in-patient Charlson scores
were available, all of which were parameterised as linear continuous measures
and were entered into our regression model distinctly as controls for pre-
hospitalisation health status.
