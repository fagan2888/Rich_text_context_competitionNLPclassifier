ABSTRACT
Background: A new index to determine body iron promises a sim-
pler approach to monitoring iron deficiency (ID) prevalence.
Objective: Our objective was to compare ID defined as body iron
,0 mg/kg and calculated from the log ratio of transferrin receptor
to ferritin (the body iron model) to ID defined as !2 of 3 abnormal
concentrations in ferritin, transferrin saturation, or erythrocyte pro-
toporphyrin (the ferritin model).
Design: We used measures of iron status and inflammation from
486 children aged 1­2 y, 848 children aged 3­5 y, and 3742 non-
pregnant females aged 12­49 y from the National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey 2003­2006.
Results: ID prevalences (6SE) based on the body iron model in
children (1­2 and 3­5 y) and in females (12­19 and 20­49 y) were
14.4 6 1.9%, 3.7 6 0.8%, 9.3 6 1.0%, and 9.2 6 1.6%, respec-
tively. ID prevalences based on the ferritin model in children (3­5 y)
and females (12­19 and 20­49 y) were 4.5 6 0.9%, 15.6 6 1.2%,
and 15.7 6 0.8%, respectively. The j statistics for agreement be-
tween the 2 models were 0.5­0.7. Among females (12­49 y) the
positive predictive values of ID based on the body iron model and
the ferritin model for identifying anemia were 43 6 3% and 30 6
2%, respectively, whereas negative predictive values did not differ.
C-reactive protein was elevated in 28.8 6 3.1% of females with ID
by the ferritin model but not by the body iron model and in 0% of
persons with ID by the body iron model but not by the ferritin
model.
Conclusions: The agreement between the 2 indexes was fair to
good. Among females, the body iron model produced lower esti-
mates of ID prevalence, better predicted anemia, and appeared to be
less affected by inflammation than the ferritin model. Am J Clin
Nutr 2009;89:1334­42.
INTRODUCTION
Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common form of nutritional
deficiency, and toddlers and females of childbearing age are at
highest risk (1, 2). ID can have several adverse effects on health,
including lower physical work capacity, increased maternal and
infant mortality (3­5), lower children's mental and physical
development, and lower cognitive function in adults (6, 7).
Monitoring iron status of vulnerable groups is an important
component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Surveys (NHANES) (8­10). Since the mid-1980s, ID has been
defined in the NHANES with a multivariable approach called
the ferritin model (1, 2, 10, 11). The ferritin model defines ID as
an abnormal value for at least 2 of 3 indicators (serum ferritin,
erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and transferrin saturation) (10).
Previous studies indicate that this approach predicts anemia
better than a single indicator (12) and produces expected pat-
terns of ID by age and sex and in relation to treatment (10).
An approach to estimating body iron developed by Cook et al
(13, 14) uses 2 indicators, ferritin (also used in the ferritin model)
and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and allows the full range
of the iron status of populations to be evaluated (13, 14). Body iron
(in mg/kg) for 14 healthy individuals was derived from direct
calculation of body iron obtained from serial phlebotomy, a gold
standard method for body iron assessment, and was compared
with serial measurements of serum ferritin and sTfR obtained
during each phlebotomy (14). The amount of storage iron for each
individual in the study at baseline was calculated from the amount
of hemoglobin iron removed to decrease the ferritin concentration
to ,12 lg/L. The amount of functional iron was calculated from
the total body iron minus the storage iron. The logarithm of the
concentrations of sTfR and ferritin had a close linear relation with
body iron in milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Body iron is
expressed as the iron surplus in stores (!0 mg/kg) or the iron
deficit in tissues (,0 mg/kg) (14).

The advantages of using the body iron model must be weighed
against the possible effect on the ability to assess changes in the
iron status of the US population over time if the ferritin model is
replaced with this new, simpler approach. In this article, we
estimate the prevalence of ID defined as body iron ,0 mg/kg and
compare these estimates with ID based on the ferritin model
among children (3­5 y) and females (12­49 y). We also evaluate
associations of ID based on the body iron and the ferritin models
with anemia, indicators of iron status, and indicators of in-
flammation among females of childbearing age.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study population and sample selection
Data from NHANES for 2003­2004 and for 2005­2006 rep-
resent the total civilian, noninstitutionalized population in the
United States for those years. Because the means of the iron status
measures did not differ between surveys for purposes of this
analysis, we combined data from these 2 surveys to increase the
statistical power. A stratified multistage probability design was
used to select participants. Data were collected by the National
Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, via household interviews and physical examinations
in mobile examination centers. Ethical approval was obtained,
and written consent was received from all participants. Procedures
for data collection and analysis are published elsewhere (15, 16).
There were 6643 nonpregnant participants who attended the
mobile examination center for NHANES 2003­2006: 1310 chil-
dren aged 1­2 y, 1241 children aged 3­5 y, and 4092 nonpregnant
females aged 12­49 y. Pregnancy status was determined by urine
pregnancy test results and self-reported pregnancy status. We
excluded those who were missing any sTfR or ferritin (n ¼ 1503)
values, and among children aged 3­5 y and females aged 12­49 y,
we also excluded individuals missing data on inflammation [in-
dicated by C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC)
count] or other measures of iron status (ie, transferrin saturation,
erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and hemoglobin) (n ¼ 54). We lim-
ited the latter set of exclusions to children aged 3­5 y and females
aged 12­49 y because transferrin saturation and erythrocyte pro-
toporphyrin were not measured in children aged 1­2 y. Ten chil-
dren aged 1­2 y missing CRP and WBC data were also excluded
from the analysis. Our final sample of 5076 individuals included
486 children aged 1­2 y, 848 children aged 3­5 y, and 3742 fe-
males aged 12­49 y. This represents 76.4% of the eligible sample
examined.
Participants excluded because of missing nutritional bio-
chemistry values did not differ from those included with regard to
race or ethnicity or sex distributions (among children), but they
differed by age. Younger children were more likely than older
children to be excluded because of missing iron status values
(t test, P 0.01). The amount of blood collected is least for those
aged 1­2 y and increases with age group to age !12 y. Assays are
prioritized; thus, assays with lower priority are more likely to be
missing because of a lack of available serum, particularly in
younger age groups. In addition, the refusal rate for phlebotomy is
higher among children than among adults (17). sTfR and ferritin
concentrations were measured at the National Center of Envi-
ronmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In
NHANES 2003­2006, the Tina-quant sTfR assay (Roche Diag-
nostics, Mannheim, Germany), an automated homogeneous im-
munoturbidimetric assay, was performed on a Hitachi 912 clinical
analyzer (Roche Diagnostics) (18). Microparticles coupled with
specific anti-sTfR monoclonal antibodies reacted with the sTfR in
the serum sample to form an antigen-antibody complex, and this
was measured turbidimetrically. The manufacturer-specified ref-
erence range for women for the Roche sTfR is 1.9­4.4 mg/L (19).
Serum ferritin was measured using 2 methods. In 2003, a
single-incubation 2-site immunoradiometric assay (BioRad Lab-
oratories, Hercules, CA) was used. This assay was discontinued
by the manufacturer in early 2004, so ferritin was measured in
2004­2006 by the Roche Tina-quant ferritin immunoturbidimetric
assay on the Hitachi 912 clinical analyzer (Roche Diagnostics,
Indianapolis, IN) (20, 21). Latex-bound ferritin antibodies react
with the antigen in the sample to form an antigen-antibody
complex, and this was measured turbidimetrically. Because of
method differences between the BioRad and Roche ferritin as-
says, we used the publicly released concentrations obtained for
2003 data using the BioRad assay adjusted to be comparable to
those obtained for 2004­2006 data using the Roche assay. This
was accomplished by 3 piecewise linear regression equations
described in detail elsewhere (20).We calculated body iron on
the basis of sTfR and ferritin concentrations (13, 14):
Body iron ðmg=kgÞ ¼ À½log10 ðsTfR 3 1000=ferritinÞ
À2:8229=0:1207 ð1Þ
For this calculation, we converted the Roche sTfR concen-
trations (20, 22) to those equivalent to the Flowers assay (23) used
in the development of the body iron model in the original study
(13, 14). We applied a conversion equation derived from a pre-
vious comparison of the 2 assays (n ¼ 40) (18): Flowers sTfR ¼
1.5 3 Roche sTfR 1 0.35 mg/L. We used the original Roche
ferritin concentrations for the body iron calculation because
a previous comparison of the Roche assay with the enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay method used by Skikne et al (14) and Cook
et al (13) in the calculation of body iron showed no difference
between these 2 methods [Roche ferritin ¼ (1.05 3 Cook
ferritin) 2 11.2 ng/mL; r ¼ 0.97; slope not different from 1; in-
tercept not different from 0; n ¼ 40; see Figure S1 under ``Sup-
plemental data'' in the online issue].
For 2003­2006, the iron and unsaturated iron-binding capacity
were measured for children aged 3­5 y and females aged 12­49 y
at the Collaborative Laboratory Services in Ottumwa, Iowa, by
the automated Beckman LX20 (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA)
(24, 25). Total iron-binding capacity was calculated indirectly
from the iron and unsaturated iron-binding capacity plus the iron
concentration. Transferrin saturation (%) was calculated by di-
viding the concentration of serum iron (lmol/L) by the total
iron-binding capacity (lmol/L).
Erythrocyte protoporphyrin for children aged 3­5 y and
females aged 12­49 y was measured by a modification of Sassa
et al. (26) by the State of New York Department of Health,
Wadsworth Center, Trace Elements Laboratory (Albany, NY) in
2003­2006 (27, 28). Protoporphyrin was extracted from EDTA-
whole blood and measured fluorometrically, and a corrected
millimolar absorptivity of 297 L Á mmol21 Á cm21 was used,
whereas Sassa et al (26) used 241 L Á mmol21 Á cm21.
We used 2 definitions of ID: body iron ,0 mg/kg (13, 14)
(body iron model) and at least 2 of 3 abnormal concentrations of

ferritin, protoporphyrin, or transferrin saturation (ferritin model)
(2, 10). Among children aged 1­2 y, transferrin saturation and
erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentrations were not measured,
and thus we did not estimate ID based on the ferritin model in
this group. The thresholds for defining abnormal values for the
biochemical indicators used in the ferritin model are shown in
Table 1 and are based on those determined for NHANES III (2).
The thresholds for low serum ferritin used in NHANES III (,10
lg/L for children aged 3­5 y and ,12 lg/L for females aged
12­49 y) (1, 2) were based on serum ferritin measured with the
BioRad assay and had to be adjusted for use with serum ferritin
measured with the Roche assay in NHANES 2003­2006. We
applied the following conversion equation for serum ferritin
,25lg/L to determine the appropriate Roche equivalent thresh-
olds (Roche ¼ 1.2534 3 BioRad 1 1.4683); the resulting ad-
justed thresholds were ,14 lg/L for children (3­5 y) and ,16.5
lg/L for females (12­49 y) (20).
Hemoglobin and WBC count were measured as part of a com-
plete blood count in the Mobile Examination Centers using the
Beckman Coulter MAXM hematology flow cytometer (Beckman
Coulter Inc, Fullerton, CA) (29, 30). We defined anemia for
children and nonpregnant women according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention thresholds (31): hemoglobin
concentration ,110 g/L for children aged 1 to ,2 y; ,111 g/L for
children aged 2 to ,5 y; ,118 g/L for girls aged 12 to ,15 y; and
,120 g/L for females aged 15­49 y.
Acute and chronic infection and inflammation can influence
iron biochemical indices; specifically, iron and transferrin satu-
ration are decreased and ferritin and erythrocyte protoporphyrin
are increased (32­34). We defined signs of infection or in-
flammation as an abnormal WBC count (.10.0 3 109/L) or CRP
(.6 mg/L) (10, 35). CRP was measured at the University of
Washington by latex-enhanced nephelometry (Dade Behring
Inc, Deerfield, IL) (36, 37).
Statistical analysis
We log-transformed sTfR and ferritin to normalize the dis-
tributions because sTfR and ferritin concentrations were not
Gaussian. We then calculated geometric means and 95% CIs. We
estimated the prevalence of ID stratified by age group among
children (age: 1­2 and 3­5 y) and among females of childbearing
age (age: 12­19 and 20­49 y). We also examined the associations
between inflammation defined by elevated CRP or WBC count
and the prevalence of ID defined by the body iron model or by the
ferritin model for the total population and stratified by population
subgroup.
To further examine the potential reasons for concordance and
discordance between the 2 ID models, we conducted several
additional analyses among females aged 12­49 y. Children aged
1­5 y were excluded from most of these analyses because of the
lack of data on transferrin saturation and erythrocyte pro-
toporphyrin for children aged 1­2 y and the low prevalence of
anemia or ID in children aged 3­5 y, which led to statistically
unreliable estimates for this age group.
Among children aged 3­5 y and females aged 12­49 y, we
calculated a j statistic for the extent of agreement between esti-
mates of ID prevalence on the basis of body iron and ferritin
models using PROC FREQ with the AGREE option in SAS for
WINDOWS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The
goal was to estimate, in the absence of a gold standard, the
agreement between the ID indices. In these analyses, the j statistic
was used to compare the agreement between 2 indices of ID (38).
If the observed agreement is greater than or equal to chance, then
j . 0. Landis and Koch (39) characterized j . 0.75 as repre-
senting excellent agreement, 0.40­0.75 as representing fair to
good agreement, and ,0.4 as representing poor agreement.
Among females aged 12­49 y, we examined the sensitivity,
specificity, and positive and negative predictivevalues of ID based
on the ferritin model compared with ID based on the body iron
model to identify females aged 12­49 y by a separate indicator of
functional ID anemia. This analysis can help to evaluate the ability
of the indicators to assess the severity of ID within a population,
which is an important aspect of the performance of the ID models.
However, anemia is a late-stage effect of ID and can also be the
result of conditions other than iron status. Thus, whereas this
analysis can provide useful information about one aspect of ID
model performance within a population, it does not assess the
ability of the models to detect milder, nonanemic forms of ID.
The differences in iron status measures and indicators of in-
fection and inflammation were examined by the following iron
status categories: 1) iron replete by both the ferritin and the body
iron models; 2) ID by both models; 3) ID by the body iron model,
replete by the ferritin model; and 4) ID by the ferritin model, re-
plete by the body iron model. Finally, we examined the ID prev-
alence based on the ferritin model and the anemia prevalence over
a range of body iron (, 24, 24 to , 22, 22 to ,0, 0 to ,2, 2 to
,4, 4 to ,6, 6 to ,8, 8 to ,10, and 10 to ,12, !12 mg/kg).
We used Student's t tests to compare differences in geometric
and arithmetic means and proportions. We used the 4-y mobile
exam center weight for all analyses as recommended by the
National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (40). We used SUDAAN (version 7.5;
Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC), ex-
cept where noted, to account for the complex sample design of
NHANES. To estimate standard errors for the j statistics for
each population subgroup, we multiplied the unweighted SE
calculated from SAS by the average design effect calculated
from SUDAAN.
Unreliable estimates were defined as relative SEs !30% but
40%. Estimates with a relative SE .40% were not reported.
For some of our analyses, multiple comparisons were made

across the iron status indicators. The point of these analyses was
not to test joint hypotheses. Rather, we tested a priori expect-
ations about each indicator in relation to the categories of iron
status. Thus, we set statistical significance at P , 0.05 with the
recognition that some of the differences in these comparisons
may be due to chance (41).
RESULTS
Mean ferritin concentrations were lower and sTfR concen-
trations were higher in children aged 1­2 y than in all other age
groups (Table 2). The prevalence of ID indicated by the body
iron model was also highest in children 1­2 y. The estimated
prevalence of ID indicated by both the body iron and the ferritin
models was lower in children aged 3­5 y than in nonpregnant
females of either age group.
In a separate analysis (data not shown), we examined the
association between the presence of at least one indicator of
inflammation, ie, elevated CRP or WBC count, and ID prevalence
defined by the body iron and the ferritin models. Inflammation
was not significantly associated with the prevalence of ID defined
by the body iron model either overall or in any of the population
subgroups (v2 tests: P ¼ 0.2017 overall, P ¼ 0.202­0.756 for
population subgroups).
In contrast, the associations between indicators of inflam-
mation and ID defined by the ferritin model were statistically
significant (v2 tests: P ¼ 0.001 overall, P ¼ 0.048­0.019) except
in children aged 3­5 y (P ¼ 0.082). Among those without in-
flammation, prevalence estimates (6SE) based on the ferritin
model in children aged 3­5 y, in females aged 12­19 y, and in
females aged 20­49 y were 3.6 6 0.7% (n ¼ 739), 14.6 6 1.3%
(n ¼ 1588), and 14.6 6 0.9% (1504), respectively. Among those
with inflammation, the ID prevalence estimates based on the
ferritin model in children aged 3­5 y, in females aged 12­19 y,
and in females aged 20­49 y were 10.8 6 4.1% (n ¼ 109),
23.1 6 3.5% (n ¼ 229), and 19.9 6 2.0% (n ¼ 421),
respectively.
The agreement between the estimates of ID prevalence based
on the ferritin model and on the body iron model was fair to good
in children aged 3­5 y (j ¼ 0.5) and good in females aged 12­
49 y (j ¼ 0.6­0.7) (Table 3). On the basis of both models
(6SE), '2% of children (2.1 6 0.5%) and 8% (8.5 6 0.5%) of
females aged 12­49 y were deficient. Because agreement be-
tween the 2 models did not appear to differ greatly by age group
among females aged 12­49 y, we combined females aged 12­
19y and females aged 20­49 y in subsequent analyses.
In females aged 12­49 y, the prevalence of ID on the basis of
the ferritin model was very high (88­100%) among those with
body iron ,0 mg/kg, was 55% among those with body iron 0­2
mg/kg, decreased exponentially with increased concentrations of
body iron, and flattened to ,2% among women with body iron
!8 mg/kg (Figure 1). In contrast, the prevalence of anemia was
'90% among those with , 24 mg/kg of body iron (Figure 2,
decreased exponentially among women with greater concen-
trations of body iron stores, and flattened to ,2% among women
with body iron !4 mg/kg.
Among nonpregnant females aged 12­49 y, sensitivity for
identifying anemia (6SE) was 63.2 6 4.2% and 75.4 6 2.7%,
respectively, by the body iron and the ferritin models (Table 4).
The proportion of nonpregnant females aged 12­49 y with ID
but not anemia was 5.2% for the body iron model and 11.0% for
the ferritin model, and thus the specificity for identifying anemia
is ,90% for the ferritin model, but 94% for the body iron
model. Among US females aged 12­49 y, ID based on body iron

appears to be a better predictor of anemia; positive predictive
values (6SE) are 30.1 6 2.1% (ferritin model) and 43.2 6 2.7%
(body iron model), respectively, whereas the negative predictive
value appears not to differ (98%).
Means of iron status measures for the women who were
classified concordantly by the 2 models (as, eg, iron deficient)
generally follow the patterns expected for those who are either
iron replete or iron deficient (Table 5). Among iron-replete
women the means of iron status measures are within the normal
range, whereas among iron-deficient women the means of iron
status measures indicate iron deficiency; ie, mean ferritin and
transferrin saturation concentrations and body iron stores are
low, whereas mean sTfR and erythrocyte protoporphyrin con-
centrations are elevated.
Of greater interest are the iron status measures for the women
with discordant classifications (Table 5). Forty-one females
(0.6%) aged 12­49 y were classified as ID by the body iron
model but as iron replete by the ferritin model. On average for
this group the ferritin concentrations (7.9 6 0.5 lg/L) were in
the iron-depleted range (,12 lg/L), and the sTfR concen-
trations (4.9 6 0.2 mg/L) were higher than those of females who
were replete on the basis of both models (3.2 6 0.03 mg/L),
whereas transferrin saturation and erythrocyte protoporphyrin
values were in the normal range. The proportion of women with
elevated WBC counts was statistically unreliable because of the
small number of women in this group. However, none had CRP

this group was normal: 23.9 6 1.3 lg/L. In addition, '29% of
these women had CRP values .6 mg/L, which suggests that
they may have an inflammatory condition, but their WBCs were
not significantly different from those of the other groups. In
addition, there was no ferritin value .50 lg/L in the ID con-
cordant group, whereas 17.4 6 3.4% of women who had body
iron !0 mg/kg, but were classified as ID by the ferritin model,
had serum ferritin values .50 lg/L (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
We present the first nationally representative data on estimated
average body iron and estimates of ID based on body iron in US
preschool-aged children, aged 1­5, and in females of child-
bearing age (12­49 y). We also provide a comparison of iron
status as defined by the body iron model with iron status as
defined by the ferritin model among females of childbearing age.
This comparison is important in light of the recent decision to use
body iron to define iron status with NHANES data to be con-
sistent with recent World Health Organization recommendations
to use ferritin and sTfR to assess the iron status of populations
(42) and also to simplify survey operations and lower expenses.
However, the ferritin model has been used to assess the preva-
lence of ID in the US population with NHANES data since the
mid-1980s, so the advantages of using the body iron model had
to be weighed against the ability to assess changes in the
prevalence of ID over time.
Few other data on body iron calculated from ferritin and sTfR
concentrations exist for children or females of ages comparable to
those examined in this study, but the patterns seen in those studies
are generally consistent with those seen here (13, 14, 43). Direct
comparison of mean body iron is complicated by differences
between study populations in iron intake, age, anemia, labora-
tory test methods, and, in the case of estimates based on a con-
venience sample from NHANES III (1988­1994) (13), the
demographic composition of the sample.
Agreement between body iron and the ferritin model for ID in
this study was fair to good on the basis of j statistics; however,
the prevalence of ID was somewhat lower for the body iron
model than for the ferritin model. Excluding individuals with

indicators of inflammation decreased but did not eliminate these
differences.
Body iron has several strengths that make it an attractive
candidate to replace the ferritin model. The ability to assess the
entire range of iron status is a major advantage. Body iron reflects
the degree of ID or repletion and can be analyzed as a continuous
variable, as opposed to the ferritin model, which produces
a categorical, yes-or-no estimate only. In our study, the anemia
prevalence was higher for females with body iron , 24 mg/kg
compared with those with body iron 24 to ,0 mg/kg, which
supports the possibility of assessing severity of ID in a population
with body iron alone.
Body iron also has some limitations. For example, the estimate
of body iron is based on a single phlebotomy study of 14 healthy
adult white subjects (14). Replication of this study, although
desirable, is unlikely given difficulties in receiving institutional
review board approval for phlebotomy studies. In addition, the
change in iron status in these subjects was measured several
weeks after a phlebotomy. It is reasonable to assume that a new
equilibrium had been reached between sTfR and ferritin in the
plasma pool within this short time period, but this has not been
rigorously investigated. Furthermore, for ethical and practical
reasons, the study did not include children or pregnant women,
so there is only indirect evidence of the validity of the body iron
model for assessment of ID in these groups (13, 14, 43­45).
Another limitation of the body iron model is the lack of
a standard sTfR assay method and a standard reference material
(42). Efforts are underway to develop and characterize a serum-
based World Health Organization international reference mate-
rial for sTFR assays. Until the reference material is available,
differences in sTfR results from different studies need to be
interpreted cautiously. In addition, sTfR data must be calibrated
to the Flowers (23) assay before body iron can be estimated.
Finally, the lack of sTfR measurements before 2003 limits the
analysis of secular trends before 2003.
The results in the present study support several advantages of
the body iron model for assessment of ID. For example, ID based
on body iron was more strongly associated with lower mean
ferritin concentrations than ID based on the ferritin model but not
on the body iron model. Second, compared with the ferritin
model, the body iron model is more strongly associated with
anemia, a separate, although imperfect, indicator of ID.
ID estimates from either index potentially can be confounded
by inflammation. But body iron includes sTfR concentrations that
tend to be less affected by inflammatory disease than most other
iron status measures (46). A recent analysis in children and
infants suggested that the low end of the body iron distribution
does not shift with inflammation (47). Similarly, in our analysis
we showed that inflammation was not associated with ID based
on the body iron model but was associated with ID based on the
ferritin model. Thus, the ferritin model may slightly over-
estimate the prevalence of ID in the US population.
This study has limitations. First, the ferritin model could not be
applied to toddlers ages 1­2 y because transferrin saturation and
free erythrocyte protoporphyrin were not measured in this age
group in 2003­2006. Second, NHANES sTfR concentrations
were adjusted to be comparable with values produced by the
Flowers (23) sTfR assay used in the development of the body
iron model (18), and an adjustment factor had to be applied to
make the ferritin concentrations in 2003 comparable with those
in subsequent survey years (20). Regression equations used to
adjust sTfR and ferritin concentrations are based on the as-
sumption that the assays remain stable over time. Third, the use
of CRP and elevated WBC count may not completely address
confounding by inflammation in ferritin measurements; eg, CRP
tends to respond rapidly to inflammation and then decline,

whereas ferritin stays elevated for a longer period (47, 48).
Fourth, bone marrow examinations, phlebotomy studies, and
response to iron treatment are considered gold standards for the
diagnosis of ID--none of which are feasible in a national survey.
Finally, the small sample size and low prevalence of ID and
anemia prevented fully evaluating the 2 models in children aged
3­5 y.
In conclusion, our study indicates that the ID prevalence in-
dicated by the body iron model follows expected patterns by age
group and that there is fair to good agreement between the body
iron model and the ferritin model for identifying ID children aged
3­5 y and good agreement in females of childbearing age. The ID
prevalence based on the body iron model is lower than that based
on the ferritin model, is less affected by inflammation, and better
predicts anemia among females of childbearing age. Whether the
body iron model is a better indicator of anemia among children or
a better indicator of ID in children and pregnant women merits
further investigation. In addition, further studies are needed to
compare the validity of these indices in relation to the gold
standard measures of iron deficiency. The ferritin model repre-
sented an important advance in assessing iron status at the time
that it was developed by improving the specificity of measuring
ID. However, newer research supports the importance of the
functional consequences of tissue ID without anemia. By focusing
on the full spectrum of iron status, the body iron model is better
equipped to assess these additional functional consequences.
