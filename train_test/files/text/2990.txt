Glycemic Index and Serum High-Density Lipoprotein
Cholesterol Concentration Among US Adults
Earl S. Ford, MD; Simin Liu, MD
Background: Dietary glycemic index, an indicator of
the ability of the carbohydrate to raise blood glucose lev-
els, and glycemic load, the product of glycemic index and
carbohydrate intake, have been positively related to risk
of coronary heart disease. However, the relationships be-
tween glycemic index and glycemic load and high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration
in the US population are unknown.
Methods: Using data from 13907 participants aged 20
years and older in the Third National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (1988-1994), we examined the
relationships between glycemic index and glycemic load,
which were determined from a food frequency question-
naire and HDL-C concentration.
Results: The age-adjusted mean HDL-C concentrations
for increasing quintiles of glycemic index distribution were
1.38,1.32,1.30,1.26,and1.27mmol/L(P.001fortrend).
(To convert millimoles per liter to milligrams per decili-
ter, divide by 0.0259.) After additional adjustment for sex,
ethnicity, education, smoking status, body mass index, al-
cohol intake, physical activity, energy fraction from car-
bohydrates and fat, and total energy intake, the mean
HDL-C concentrations for ascending quintiles of glyce-
mic index were 1.36, 1.31, 1.30, 1.27, and 1.28 mmol/L
(P.001 for trend). Adjusting for the same covariates and
considering glycemic index as a continuous variable, we
found a change in HDL-C concentration of -0.06 mmol/L
per 15-unit increase in glycemic index (P.001). The
multiple R2 for the model was 0.23. Similarly, the mul-
tivariate-adjusted mean HDL-C concentrations for as-
cending quintiles of glycemic load distribution were 1.35,
1.31,1.31,1.30,and1.26mmol/L(P.001forlineartrend).
The inverse relationships between glycemic index and
glycemic load and HDL-C persisted across all subgroups
of participants categorized by sex or body mass index.
Conclusions: These findings from a nationally repre-
sentative sample of US adults suggest that high dietary
glycemic index and high glycemic load are associated with
a lower concentration of plasma HDL-C.

CARDIOVASCULAR disease
remains the leading cause
of mortality in the United
States, despite notable de-
clines in the cardiovascu-
lar-related mortality rate since the 1960s.1
High-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C) is a powerful predictor of the de-
velopment of coronary heart disease.2-4
Various factors are associated with HDL-C
concentrations, including sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, physical activity,
body mass index (BMI), alcohol use, ciga-
rette smoking, and diet.2 In metabolic stud-
ies, Katan5 showed that increased intake
of carbohydrates reduces HDL-C concen-
trations. Besides the quantitative relation-
ship between carbohydrate intake and
HDL-C concentrations, the quality of the
carbohydrate characterized by glycemic
index may also affect HDL-C concentra-
tions. For example, a recent study6 re-
ported that glycemic index was the only
dietary variable that was associated with
HDL-C concentrations in a national study
of the adult population in England.
The glycemic index of foods reflects
their tendency to affect postprandial glu-
cose and insulin concentrations.7 Thus,
given equal amounts of carbohydrate, food
with a high glycemic index leads to higher
postprandial glucose and insulin concen-
trations than food with a low glycemic in-
dex. Although it has been long known that
foods affect glucose and insulin concentra-
tions differently, the clinical significance of
the glycemic index remains controversial.8
Current dietary guidelines in the United
States do not recommend the use of glyce-
mic index, although many recommenda-
tions are generally consistent with the con-
sumptionoffoodswithalowglycemicindex
and avoidance of refined foods with a high
glycemic index.9,10 Examples of foods with
a lower glycemic index include various le-
gumes, pasta, and minimally refined prod-

ucts.11 Examples of foods with a higher glycemic index in-
clude potatoes, white breads with refined flour, and refined
grain cereals. Recently, several studies found that the gly-
cemic index is positively associated with the incidence of
type 2 diabetes mellitus12,13 and cardiovascular disease.14
Because persons consuming diets with a high gly-
cemic index may have lower HDL-C concentrations than
persons consuming a diet with a lower glycemic index,
thus indirectly increasing the risk of coronary heart dis-
ease, we examined data from the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) to ex-
amine the relationship between glycemic index and
HDL-C concentrations in the US population.15,16
RESULTS
For glycemic index, the rounded quintiles were 75% or
less, 76% to 79%, 80% to 83%, 84% to 87%, and 88% or
higher. For glycemic load, the quintiles were 98 or less,
99 to 127, 128 to 157, 158 to 198, and 199 or higher. As
theglycemicindexincreased,decreasingtrendswerenoted
for age, white race, education, and BMI (Table 1). The
percentage of men, current smokers, and physically inac-
tive participants was directly associated with increasing
glycemic index. Except for education, current smoking,
and physical inactivity, the relationships between glyce-
mic load and the other variables were similar to those de-
scribed for glycemic index (Table 2).

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS
Started in 1988 and completed in 1994, NHANES III in-
cluded a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized
civilian population, which was selected by using a multi-
stage, stratified sampling design. Persons 60 years and older
and African American and Mexican American persons were
oversampled. After a home interview, participants were in-
vited to attend 1 of 3 examination sessions: morning, after-
noon, or evening. For some participants who were unable
to attend the examination because of health reasons, a blood
samplewasobtainedduringthehomeinterview.Personswho
attended the morning session were asked to fast for 12 hours
before the session. Those who attended the afternoon or
evening session were asked to fast for 6 hours.
Serum HDL-C was measured enzymatically (Hitachi
704 Analyzer; Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, India-
napolis, Ind) after precipitation of other lipoproteins with
a manganese chloride­heparin solution. Details about
quality-controlprocedureshavebeenpublishedelsewhere.16
Values are reported in millimoles per liter; to convert to
milligrams per deciliter, divide by 0.0259.
Dietary variables were created from responses to a food
frequency questionnaire administered to participants to as-
sess their usual diet over the past month. Respondents were
asked how often over the past month they had eaten speci-
fied food items. If the frequency of consumption was re-
ported as never, the value was recorded as zero. Based on pre-
viouswork,11,14 wedeterminedglycemicindexvaluesforfoods
reported on the food frequency questionnaire. For example,
glycemic index values were 102% for potato, 100% for white
bread, 55% for apple, and 13% for broccoli. In particular, us-
ing the method described by Liu,17,18 we calculated dietary
glycemicloadbymultiplyingthecarbohydratecontentofeach
food by its glycemic index value; this value was then multi-
plied by the frequency of consumption and summed for all
fooditems.11 Valuesforthecarbohydratecontentofeachfood
were obtained from the US Department of Agriculture food
composition tables.19 We calculated the average glycemic
index for each participant by dividing each person's glyce-
mic load scores by their total daily intake of carbohydrates.
Because individual food portion size was not collected in
NHANES III, we applied standard serving sizes according to
values published in the US Department of Agriculture food
composition tables.19 Previous studies20-22 showed that addi-
tional queries on portion size for participants provided few
changes in participants' ranking according to their relative
intake of foods and nutrients.
We included other variables in the analyses: age, sex,
race or ethnicity (white, African American, Mexican Ameri-
can, or other), education (years of attendance), smoking
status (current, former, or never), BMI (calculated as weight
in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters),
alcoholconsumption(drinkspermonth),leisure-timephysi-
cal activity, energy fraction from protein and carbohy-
drates, and total energy intake. Alcohol consumption was
determined from responses to a food frequency question-
naire. For regression models, we created a physical activ-
ity index by summing the products of the frequency of par-
ticipation in 1 of 9 specific activities or up to 4 additional
self-reported activities by the metabolic equivalent level for
each reported activity. The energy fraction from protein and
carbohydrates and the total energy intake were calculated
from a single 24-hour dietary recall.
We limited the analyses to participants 20 years or older
who attended the medical examination and included 13907
participants (6825 men and 7082 women) with complete in-
formation in our analyses. We treated glycemic index, car-
bohydrate intake, and glycemic load as either continuous or
categorical variables. Means or percentages for HDL-C con-
centration and baseline characteristics were calculated for
quintiles of glycemic index and glycemic load. To examine
the significance of means or percentages of these variables
by quintiles of glycemic index and glycemic load, we per-
formed tests for linear trend. Least squares­adjusted means
of HDL-C concentration were calculated using analysis of
covariance. Tests for linear trend were performed using re-
gression analysis by assigning the median values of glyce-
micindexorglycemicloadforeachofthequintiles.Allanaly-

ThedecreaseinHDL-Cconcentrationwithincreasinggly-

with a BMI less than 25 and 25 or higher. Adjusting for the
same covariates and considering glycemic index as a con-
tinuous variable, we found a change in HDL-C concentra-
tion of -0.06 mmol/L per 15-unit increase in glycemic in-
dex (P.001). The multiple R2 for the model was 0.23.
The pattern of decreases in HDL-C concentration
with increases in glycemic load were similar to those de-
scribed for glycemic index except that the sex differ-
ences noted for glycemic index were less pronounced
(Table 4). The multiple R2 for the model was 0.20. Elimi-
nating participants with glucose concentrations of 7
mmol/L or higher or those with previously diagnosed dia-
betes mellitus did not change our results materially. The
multiply adjusted HDL-C concentrations were 1.36, 1.31,
1.32, 1.31, and 1.29 mmol/L for quintiles 1 through 5 of
glycemic load, respectively (P=.007 for trend).
COMMENT
In this representative sample of US adults, we found that
a lower quality of carbohydrate intake as characterized
by a high glycemic index was associated with a lower
HDL-C concentration, independent of factors known to
be associated with HDL-C concentrations and the amount
of carbohydrate intake. Our results are consistent with
findings from a survey conducted by Frost et al6 in a na-
tional sample of adults in England. They recently re-
ported that glycemic index and HDL-C concentration were
inversely related among 1420 British participants aged
18 to 64 years in a cross-sectional study. The percentage
decrease in HDL-C concentration among men in their
study was similar to that observed in our study. They
found a stronger inverse relationship between glycemic
index and HDL-C concentration among women than men,
however. These differences are likely due to differences
in the demographic compositions of the 2 samples and
to the use of different dietary instruments.
Because our results were derived from a cross-
sectional study, we cannot conclude that changes in the
glycemic index and glycemic load can cause changes in
HDL-C concentrations. The food frequency question-
naire that we used was an abbreviated one and did not

include questions about portion size, which inevitably
led to some misclassification of participants' dietary in-
take. Consequently, we probably underestimated the mag-
nitude of the decreases in HDL-C concentration with in-
creases in glycemic index or glycemic load. We may have
failed to account for relevant confounders or incom-
pletely adjusted for selected confounders. Finally, the ap-
parent association between glycemic index or glycemic
load and HDL-C concentration may be due to another
nutrient.
Although it has long been known that diet can affect
circulating concentrations of HDL-C, much remains to be
learnedabouthowspecificaspectsofdietcanaffectHDL-C

that for every decrease of about 0.026 mmol/L in HDL-C
concentration,theriskofcoronaryheartdiseaseincreased
by 1.9% to 2.3% in men and 3.2% in women. Thus, an in-
crease in the adjusted HDL-C concentration of about 8%
inmenand2%inwomencouldtheoreticallyreducecoro-
nary heart disease by about 8% in men and 3.5% in wom-
en. In the United States in 1996, about 242036 men and
234088 women died of coronary heart disease, and about
1.1millionAmericanswereestimatedtohavehadmyocar-
dialinfarctionorfatalcoronaryheartdisease.23 Therefore,
the potential reductions in coronary heart disease events
andmortalityduetochangesinHDL-Cconcentrations,such
as those we found, are not trivial.
Although metabolic studies in patients with diabetes
mellitus or hyperlipidemia have shown lower total cho-
lesterol concentrations when carbohydrates with a low gly-
cemic index are substituted for those with a high glyce-
mic index, findings on HDL-C concentrations have been
less consistent.24-28 Therefore, the recent findings in 2 na-
tional surveys in the United States in the present study and
England6 need to be confirmed by prospective studies or
clinical metabolic trials of healthy persons. Because of the
long-standingcontroversyaboutthepotentialetiologicrole
of glycemic index in the pathogenesis of several chronic
diseases and the short-term nature of metabolic data, data
from large prospective cohorts that directly relate dietary
carbohydrates, glycemic index, and glycemic load to the
subsequent development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and
coronary heart disease will be most informative. In the fi-
nal analysis, the ultimate criterion by which to judge the
clinical utility of the glycemic index or that of any other
classification schemes of foods is its ability to predict dis-
ease outcomes. If dietary carbohydrate composition influ-
ences HDL-C concentrations, recommendations about the
best dietary sources of carbohydrates may need to be re-
fined. In light of recent data suggesting that dietary carbo-
hydrate composition may affect the risk of type 2 diabetes
