Differences in the association of cardiovascular risk
factors with education: a comparison of Costa Rica
(CRELES) and the USA (NHANES)
David H Rehkopf,1 William H Dow,2 Luis Rosero-Bixby3
ABSTRACT
Background Despite different levels of economic
development, Costa Rica and the USA have similar
mortalities among adults. However, in the USA there are
substantial differences in mortality by educational
attainment, and in Costa Rica there are only minor
differences. This contrast motivates an examination of
behavioural and biological correlates underlying this
difference.
Methods The authors used data on adults aged 60 and
above from the Costa Rican Longevity and Healthy
Ageing Study (CRELES) (n¼2827) and from the US
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) (n¼5607) to analyse the cross-sectional
association between educational level and the following
risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD): ever
smoked, current smoker, sedentary, high saturated fat,
high carbohydrates, high calorie diet, obesity, severe
obesity, large waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, LDL
cholesterol, triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose,
C-reactive protein, systolic blood pressure and BMI.
Results There were significantly fewer hazardous levels
of risk biomarkers at higher levels of education for more
than half (10 out of 17) of the risk factors in the USA, but
for less than a third of the outcomes in Costa Rica (five
out of 17).
Conclusions These results are consistent with the
context-specific nature of educational differences in risk
factors for CVD and with a non-uniform nature of
association of CVD risk factors with education within
countries. Our results also demonstrate that social equity
in mortality is achieved without uniform equity in all risk
factors.
INTRODUCTION
While, in developed Western countries1 2 and some
non-Western countries,3 there is generally an asso-
ciation of lower educational attainment with
greater risk of mortality, others have described the
historically contingent and contextually specific
nature of such associations.4 A recently docu-
mented example of a different mortality pattern
with respect to educational attainment is among
older individuals in Costa Rica. While there are
higher rates of mortality among children of
mothers with less than a primary school educa-
tion,5 there are relatively minor associations
between mortality and education in Costa Ricans
age 60 and above.6 While education differentials in
mortality are generally smaller at older ages,7 recent
analysis in the USA of similar aged individuals
reveal substantial differentials by education, with
mortalities 5e6% higher per year for each year less
of education.8
Costa Rica is a case of particular interest because
of its historic emphasis on progressive social and
health sector programmes. The country began
investing in female education in the late 19th
century, abolished the army in the mid-20th
century, invested heavily in public health initiatives
such as clean water, has strongly promoted primary
care initiatives in its medical sector and adopted
national health insurance in the 1970s. Costa Rica's
high overall life expectancy (higher even than the
USA) has been linked to its social investments,9 but
until the recent Costa Rican Longevity and Healthy
Ageing Study (CRELES), few data have been
available to understand why there is a lack of social
class differences in older adult mortality in Costa
Rica.
There have been several hypotheses for
explaining the aggregated general associations of
adult mortality and education. One of these is the
theory of social conditions as fundamental causes
of disease.10 11 This theory posits that socio-
economic resources, for example, as measured by
educational attainment, affect multiple risk factors
for diseases. This is posited to occur through the
ability of people to use resources to avoid multiple
causes of riskdand implies some similarity of the
association of education with multiple pathways to
disease outcomes. Other theories involve the
primacy of factors including technical progress in
medical care,12 13 the importance of time prefer-
ences,14 15 social rank16 or income inequality.17
Within each of these proposed drivers of socio-
economic heterogeneity in mortality, proponents
generally do not focus on particular pathways but
imply more general effects on disease processes. An
alternative explanation of the mortality education
association is that a more complex pattern of the
association of education and biological pathways
exists. The associations may not be of a uniform
magnitude or even direction. These different asso-
ciations between education and risk factors may
instead combine to create the educational differ-
ences observed for mortality. Whether data are
more consistent with either of these potential
explanations has important implications for poli-
cies to decrease the link between lower levels of
education and higher rates of mortality.
We focus here on risk factors for cardiovascular
disease (CVD) because (1) a substantial part of the
education disparities in mortality in the USA is
from CVD,18 (2) roughly 40% of deaths at ages 60
and over in Costa Rica are due to cardiovascular

Research report
diseases,19 and (3) risk factors are relatively well characterised.
While CVD is a heterogeneous category, and there are some
differences in the risk factors for the specific causes of death
within it (eg, early life exposures for haemorragic stroke),20
known risk factors explain the majority of cases of CVD.21 22
Our approach to understanding the different associations of
education and mortality in Costa Rica and the USA is to
examine the relative strength of education gradients in risk
factors for CVD, both biological and behavioural. Our choice of
risk factors was guided by the published guidelines of the
American Heart Association,23 the American College of Cardi-
ology24 25 and the WHO.26 We examined risk factors that
together explain the majority of CVD risk,23 27 and there are no
substantial variations between countries in the risk factors
predicting CVD.28 While many of these risk factors are corre-
lated, we include each of these risks separately because of
potentially different associations with education. Exposures over
the life course may affect levels of certain biological risk
markers,29e32 in addition to current behaviours.33 Thus, while
our analysis of behavioural risk factors focuses on current
assessment of exposures, the biomarkers and anthropometric
measures should be interpreted as the cumulative result of
exposures over the lifespan.34
METHODS
Samples
Data from Costa Rica are from the Costa Rican Longevity and
Healthy Ageing Study (CRELES), a nationally representative,
probabilistic sample of adults aged 60 and over (from a popula-
tion of approximately 350 000) selected from the 2000 census
database.35 A selected subsample of this population (n¼1329
men, n¼1498 women) with oversampling of the oldest old
completed a survey in their household between November 2004
and September 2006 which is the basis of the analytical sample.
This subsample had the following non-response rates: 19% of
individuals were deceased by the contact date, 18% could not be
found, 2% had moved, and 4% rejected the interview. Among
those interviewed, 95% provided a fasting blood sample.
Data from the USA are from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999e2004,
restricted to adults aged 60 and over (n¼2411 men, n¼3196
women). These cross-sectional data are representative of the
non-institutionalised population of the USA. NHANES follows
a four-stage sampling procedure where the primary sampling
units are counties, within which city blocks are selected. Within
these blocks, households are then randomly selected, and then
individuals are drawn at random from designated ageerace/
ethnicityesex subdomains.36
This research was approved by Human Subject committees
at Universidad de Costa Rica and University of California,
Berkeley.
Demographic, health-related behaviours and dietary measures
Our primary exposure of interest is attained level of formal
education. Since the absolute level of educational attainment has
different social and economic meaning in each country, it does
not make sense to use the same categories of education. For
Costa Rica, educational attainment was categorised into three
groups: less than 3 years of education, 3e6 years of education
(elementary school comprises six grades), and at least 1 year of
high school. For the USA, we use the educational categories of
less than high school, high school or greater than high school.
We performed sensitivity analyses with Costa Rican educational
categories of none, 1e5 years of education (some primary) and
6 years or more (completed primary), and findings were gener-
ally similar (results shown in supplemental data tables S1 and
S2).
In both NHANES and CRELES, ever smoked was assessed by
the question `Have you smoked more than 100 cigarettes or
cigars in your life?' and current smoking was assessed by the
question `Do you smoke now?' In CRELES, sedentary behaviour
was defined as participants responding `no' to the question `In
the last 12 months, did you exercise regularly or do other
physical rigorous activities like sports, jogging, dancing or heavy
work, three times a week?' In NHANES, sedentary behaviour
was assessed by whether individuals reported physical activity
fewer than 13 times in the last 30 days, and answered `No' to
the question of `you do heavy work or carry heavy loads' as an
average level of physical activity each day.
CRELES collected dietary data using a modified version of
a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that was developed and
validated specifically to assess nutrient intake among the Costa
Rican adult population.37 38 Dietary averages in NHANES were
based on calculations from two 24 h dietary recalls.39 Standard
cut points associated with differential risk of cardiovascular
disease were used to create dichotomous variables as follows:
high-saturated-fat diet (>40 g per day), high-carbohydrate diet
(>400 g per day) and high-calorie diet (>3000 kcal/day).
Anthropometric and biomarker outcomes
For anthropometric measures, we examine BMI (as continuous),
obese (BMI >30), severely obese (BMI >40) and large waist
(>102 cm among men, >88 cm among women). In both studies,
height and weight were measured, and waist circumference was
measured at the midaxillary line.
The seven biomarkers examined were high-density-lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL cholesterol), low-density-lipoprotein choles-
terol (LDL cholesterol), triglycerides, glycosylated hemoglobin
(hemoglobin A1c), fasting glucose, systolic blood pressure and
C-reactive protein (CRP). All biomarkers were measured using
similar methods in both countries. Sitting systolic blood pres-
sure was measured twice in CRELES40 and up to four times n
NHANES.41 When multiple blood pressure readings were taken,
the first reading was excluded from the average (if only two
measures were taken, the second reading was used).41
Statistical analysis
All analyses accounted for oversampling and clustered sampling
using the survey package in STATA 10 (StataCorp, Texas, USA).
Sampling weights and clustering were at the PSU level (n¼49) in
NHANES and at the health area level in CRELES (n¼60).
Continuous outcomes were analysed using linear regression, and
dichotomous outcomes were analysed using logistic regression,
controlling for age and age squared. Because there were statis-
tically significant interactions between education and gender for
a number of outcomes in both countries (data not shown,
available upon request), all analyses are presented stratified by
gender. In NHANES, analyses of blood glucose, LDL cholesterol
and triglycerides were examined only in the randomly assigned
fasting subsample (n¼1016 men, n¼1065 women).
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the distribution of demographic characteristics,
health behaviours, dietary averages, anthropometric measures
and prevalent health conditions in CRELES and NHANES by
gender.
Among health behaviours related to cardiovascular disease
mortality, Costa Rica has a lower percentage of current smokers

among women. The USA has a much higher percentage of
women who had ever smoked. Men and women in the USA
were more likely to be obese, to be severely obese and to have
a larger waist circumference, with higher proportions of each
among women than among men in both countries. In the USA,
there were lower levels of hypertension, higher levels of hyper-
cholesterolaemia and lower levels of diabetes (among women).
Figure 1 shows a comparison (NHANESdsolid lines;
CRELESddashed lines) of the population distribution of eight
biological risk markers for CVD. All median differences shown
are statistically significantly different at the a¼0.05 level except
for LDL cholesterol. Costa Ricans show substantially higher
triglycerides and systolic blood pressure and substantially lower
BMI. The overall distribution of these biological risk factors are
generally similar between NHANES and CRELES, with the
exception of an upwardly shifted distribution of systolic blood
pressure in CRELES, and a higher right-hand tail of BMI distri-
bution in the USA.
Figure 2 presents ORs of smoking, physical activity, diet and
anthropometric measures by educational attainment, control-
ling for age, age-squared and stratified by gender. The ORs can be
interpreted as the ratio of the odds of the outcome in either the
middle or highest education category as compared with the
lowest education category. In Costa Rica, there was a higher
proportion of individuals with a high saturated-fat diet among
the most educated. Among Costa Rican men, the most educated
were more likely to be obese and more likely to have a large
waist circumference. Among women, there was a lower proba-
bility of lifetime smoking and being sedentary among the more
educated and a higher probability of having a high calorie diet. In
the USA, more educated individuals were significantly less likely
to be sedentary. Among men in the USA, more educated were
less likely to be current smokers, less likely to be lifetime
smokers but more likely to have a high-carbohydrate and high-
calorie diet. Among women, more educated women were less
likely to be obese and have a large waist circumference.
Figure 3 shows differences in levels of eight biological risk
factors for CVD by educational attainment, controlling for age,
age-squared and stratified by gender. The plotted betas from
linear regression models can be interpreted as absolute differ-
ences in the level of the biomarker among those in the middle or
highest educational categories as compared with the lowest
education category. In Costa Rica, higher educational attain-
ment is associated with lower levels of LDL among men, and
lower levels of hemoglobin A1c and systolic blood pressure in
women. Among men in the USA, there are higher levels of
triglycerides among men in the middle education category and
lower levels of hemoglobin A1c. Among women in the USA,
among the more educated there were higher (lower risk) levels of
HDL cholesterol, lower levels of hemoglobin A1c, lower levels of
fasting glucose, lower levels of C-reactive protein and lower
levels of BMI.
Thus, overall, there were significantly fewer hazardous levels
of risk biomarkers at higher levels of education for more than
half (10 out of 17) of the risk factor outcomes in the USA. This
was true for less than a third of the outcomes in Costa Rica (five

out of 17). In Costa Rica, higher levels of education were asso-
ciated with higher risk levels for approximately one-quarter
(four out of 17) of the risk factor outcomes, while this was the
case for three out of 17 risk factors in the USA.
DISCUSSION
We found that there was not a uniform lack of education
differentials of risk factors in Costa Rica nor a universal presence
of education differentials in risk factors in the USA. Instead, we
found education differentials in the USA driven by lower levels
of current smoking, lifetime smoking, sedentary behaviour and
hemoglobin A1c among more educated men and lower levels
of sedentary behaviour, obesity, large waist circumference,
hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose, C-reactive protein, BMI and
higher HDL cholesterol among more educated women. In Costa
Rica, some important risk factors (eg, smoking, higher systolic
blood pressure and sedentary) are more prevalent among the less
educated, but other important risk factors such as obesity
(among men) or overall high calorie and saturated fat diets
(among women) are more prevalent among those with less
education. This combination of risk factors may on balance act
to create the observed educationemortality differences between
these two countries. The differential importance of education
depended on country context. Among the 17 gender-stratified
outcomes examined, the only similarly statistically significant
education differentials we observed were for sedentary behav-
iour and hemoglobin A1c among women. These observations are
not consistent with universal effects associated with educational
attainment. In addition, at least in each of these two countries,
there is little evidence for universal associations between
education and risk factors for CVD.
There are several limitations to this descriptive study.
Multiple risk factors may interact,24 and the clustering of risk
factors may be different in each country. While there may be
other biological pathways with different education associations
that we do not examine, known risk factors explain the majority
of absolute levels of CVD as well as socio-economic differ-
ences.21 22 42 43 It is unlikely that racial/ethnic minorities in the
USA are the reason for the differences in the association of
education with risk factors, as we repeated our analysis using
only the non-Hispanic white population of the USA, and results
did not change substantively (data not shown). We also repeated
our analysis with alternative educational categories in Costa
Rica, which did not meaningfully change our overall findings
(shown in supplemental data, tables S1 and S2). The time
periods of these data differ slightly (1999e2004 in the USA and
2004e2006 in Costa Rica), but evidence suggests that socio-
economic differences are not changing rapidly enough for this to
influence our comparison.44 Data from Costa Rica were available
only for individuals age 60 and above, so inference should not be
made outside this age range. Results depend on our measure of
socio-economic position, with education more likely to capture
early life exposures.45 46 Finally, measures of sedentary behaviour
and dietary intake differed between surveys, so these compari-
sons should be interpreted with some caution.
Some prior work has also sought to understand international
differences in risk factors underlying CVD.2 47 In contrast with
our results, education differences in CVD risk factors in
a younger population (age 40e70) in the USA and England
qualitatively reveal similar education differences for dichotom-
ised measures of HbA1c, blood pressure, C-reactive protein,
fibrinogen and HDL cholesterol, current smoking, ever smoking

we found different associations between education and obesity
by gender (a significant positive association among men in Costa
Rica, and a significant negative association among women in the
USA) that are unlikely to be explained solely by sex-linked
biology.
The motivating question was to determine whether risk
factor and education associations were absent in Costa Rica and
present and consistent across examined factors in the USA, or
whether there was a balance of different types of risk factor
associations with education that lead to the observed mortalitye
education associations. Our findings are consistent with the
latter. This is less consistent with any one factor having a
majority influence on educational differences in mortality.
Nevertheless, a number of theories may still be relevant, but
based on our findings, the effects may be specific to particular
pathways. While this complexity may be daunting for efforts
to reduce education disparities in mortality, a lack of universal
associations with education also implies potentially more
tractable approaches of focussing prevention and treatment on
the specific risk factors most responsible for differences in
disparities.

What is already known on this subject
In most developed countries (eg, the USA), there are currently
higher rates of cardiovascular disease among individuals with
lower levels of education. Costa Rica is a remarkable exception to
this, with no differences in cardiovascular disease by level of
education among individuals over the age of 60. It is unknown
whether this socio-economic equity in cardiovascular mortality
results from universal equity in the distribution of risk factors for
cardiovascular disease, or from a balance of different education
associations with risk factors.
What this study adds
This study shows that there is not a uniform lack of education
associations with cardiovascular risk factors in Costa Rica, nor
a uniform presence of education associations with cardiovascular
risk factors in the USA. Instead, a balance of different educatione
risk factor associations are found that are consistent with
the observed differences in the cardiovascular mortality and
education associations found in each country. This demonstrates
that social equity in cardiovascular mortality is achieved without
uniform equity of risk factors.
