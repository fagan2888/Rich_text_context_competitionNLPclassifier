Abstract
Background: it has been observed that a frailty index (FI) is limited by the value of 0.7. Whether this holds in countries
with higher mortality rates is not known.
Objectives: to test for and quantify a limit in very old Chinese adults and to relate mortality risk to the FI.
Design: secondary analysis of four waves (1998, 2000, 2002 and 2005) of the Chinese Longitudinal Health and Longevity
Study (CLHLS).
Subjects: a total of 6,300 people from 22 of 31 provinces in China, aged 80­99 years at baseline and followed up to
7 years.
Methods: an FI was calculated as the ratio of actual to 38 possible health deficits. Frequency distributions were used to
evaluate the limit to the FI. Logistic regression and survival analysis were used to evaluate the relationship between the FI
and mortality.
Results: at each wave, a 99% submaximal limit to frailty was observed at FI = 0.7, despite consecutive losses to death.
The death rate for those who were healthiest at baseline (i.e. those in whom the baseline FI = 0) increased from 0.18 at the
2-year follow-up to 0.69 by 7 years. At each wave, 100% mortality at 2 years was observed at FI close to 0.67. A baseline
FI >0.45 was associated with 100% 7-year mortality.
Conclusions: a limit to frailty occurred with FI = 0.7 which was not exceeded at any age or in any wave. There appears
to be a demonstrable limit to the number of health problems that people can tolerate.
Keywords: ageing, frailty index, limit to frailty, mortality, China, older people

Introduction
Around the world, populations are ageing because more
people are becoming older, and older people are living longer.
China records the largest population of adults aged 60+ years
in the world [1]. It has an average life expectancy of 73 years
[2], with 12.0 million people aged 80+ years (9.2% of the
older population). In China as elsewhere, although the mor-
tality risk increases with age, not every one of the same age
has the same risk of dying. This variable vulnerability to death
and other adverse outcomes among people of the same age,
known as frailty, can be operationalised in a frailty index (FI)
[3]. For any individual, an FI can be calculated as a count of
the number of health deficits they have accumulated, which is
expressed as the proportion of health deficits considered [3].
For example, in a health survey that recorded 50 deficits, a
person with no deficits would have an FI of 0/50 = 0; one
who had accumulated 20 deficits would have an FI score of
20/50 = 0.40. An FI based on deficit accumulation has been
independently validated by several groups and shown to be
closely related to the risk of death [4­12].
In general, vulnerability to death and other adverse out-
comes is said to arise from the `loss of physiological reserve',
which can be quantified according to a reliability theory of
ageing that is rooted in engineering concepts [13, 14]. The
body thus is seen as a complex system with significant redun-
dancies that diminish as deficits accumulate. When redun-
dancy is exhausted, the system can accumulate no new
deficits without failure. Characteristically, redundancy exhaus-
tion occurs at an FI value of 0.7 [3, 15, 16]. The presence of
such a quantifiable submaximal limit to frailty (i.e. a limit at
FI < 1.0) is of considerable interest. If a quantifiable limit to
frailty is verifiable, it has the potential to aid public health
planning, as well as to assist clinical decision-making in being
able to better estimate risks. The Chinese Longitudinal Health
and Longevity Study (CLHLS) 1998­2005 data set allows for
a severe test of the hypothesis of a limit to frailty, because it
contains data on a large number of people, who at the age of
80+ years, have lived past the average life expectancy for their
cohort, and who therefore would be candidates to exceed the
limit to frailty. Another group has shown that levels of frailty
increase exponentially in the CLHLS from ages 65 to 100
[11], indicating that the CLHLS is composed of people in
whom worsening of health prior to death can be expected. In
these community dwelling, very old Chinese people, our
objectives were: to evaluate whether there is a quantifiable,
submaximal limit to the number of health deficits that people
can accumulate; to examine the behaviour of deficit accumu-
lation close to this limit and to determine the relationship
between frailty and mortality.
Methods
Participants and setting
This is a secondary analysis of data from the first four
waves (1998, 2000, 2002 and 2005) of the 1998­2005
CLHLS. The data set contains baseline information on
9,093 community-dwelling respondents from 22 of
China's 31 provinces. The survey was designed to include
as many centenarians as would participate, yielding 2,418
respondents over the age of 100. For this study, centenar-
ians were omitted due to their disproportionate represen-
tation, potential problems with age verification and
potentially suspect generalisability, which is a subject of a
separate study by our group. A further 241 respondents
were omitted due to incomplete baseline data. The four
waves contain information on 6,300; 3,716; 2,164 and
912 eligible people, respectively, with mortality recorded in
1,909; 1,087 and 1,013 people at each respective wave.
Death data were obtained through death certificates, next
of kin or neighbourhood committees, and all mortality
data were validated. Another 1,380 (675, 466, 239 at each
respective follow-up) were lost to the follow-up. The
CLHLS used questionnaires, completed by respondents
and/or next of kin, to record data on personal, family
and household characteristics, lifestyle and diet, economic
resources, social support, and physical, cognitive and psy-
chological conditions [11, 17].
Frailty index
The FI was created following a standard procedure [18].
Symptoms, signs, disabilities and diseases were considered
as health deficits, if they: were associated with the health
status; had a prevalence >1%; generally increased with
age, recognising that some age-related adverse conditions
become less common in extreme old age due to survivor
effects; did not saturate (i.e. were found to be present in
most people at an early age, quantified here as a preva-
lence of 80%) and in their aggregate, represented several
physiological systems [18]. Each variable was re-coded as
0 (absence of deficit), 1 (presence of deficit) or missing.
The 1998­2005 CLHLS data set included 45 deficits, 29
of which had been used by another group to construct
an FI [11, 19]. We considered all 29 of these, plus 16
other variables that met the above criteria. Of these 45
variables, 4 were excluded due to saturation, 2 because
they were not age related and 1 (`Feel lonely and isolated')
because it was considered to reflect social vulnerability
more than frailty. For each individual, the FI score was
calculated by summing the deficits present and dividing
by the 38 deficits considered (Supplementary data are
available in Age and Ageing online, Appendix A). No indi-
vidual at baseline had >5% missing data. For individuals
in whom variables had missing data, we excluded the
variables from the denominator and the numerator.
Outcomes were described using all data points for four
cycles (over 10 years). The recorded date of death was
verified by police registry and death certificate upon
availability. The data were obtained from Duke
University, Center for the Study of Aging and Human
Development [17].

Limit to frailty in very old, community-dwelling people
Statistical analysis
To identify the upper limit to frailty, for each wave, the dis-
tributions of the FI, its maximal value and the 0.95 and
0.99 quantiles were identified. The rate of deficit accumula-
tion was calculated as the slope of the least squares mean
value of the FI (on a logarithmic scale) in relation to age.
To evaluate whether the rate of deficit accumulation slows
with increasing frailty, the best fit log of the FI was evalu-
ated in relation to age, having separated the data into 95
and 99th percentiles, as detailed elsewhere [15].
Binary logistic regression was used to evaluate the rela-
tionship between the baseline FI and mortality at each
wave. Kaplan­Meier analysis was used to estimate the
7-year survival in relation to the FI. To compare the impact
of age, sex and frailty on mortality, Cox proportional
hazards regression models were employed. Proportionality
of hazards assumption was tested by correlating corre-
sponding sets of scaled Schoenfeld residuals with a suitable
transformation of time for each estimate. All analyses were
performed using SPSS version 15.0 for Windows or codes
developed using Matlab version 7.1 (Matsoft, Inc.).
Results
People who were frailer tended to be older, more often
women, less likely married and had no formal education
(Table 1). The statistical density distributions (Figure 1)
were typically skewed, with long right tails. Consistent with
overall worsening health, the mean FI value increased from
0.13 at baseline to 0.15, 0.17 and 0.19 with each consecu-
tive wave. Even so, an upper limit to frailty was observed at
the outset and was not exceeded: at each wave, 99% of
respondents had FI scores <0.7 (Figure 1). No one at base-
line had an FI > 0.7; one person did at a subsequent wave,
but survived for only a few months thereafter.
The mean of the logarithm of the FI was highly corre-
lated with age (r = 0.97 at baseline). This mean increased at
3.2% per year (Supplementary data are available in Age
and Ageing online, Appendix B). In all four waves, the mean
values of the FI increased exponentially as a function of
age. At the 95 and 99th percentiles of the FI, the slope of
the mean FI values (in relation to age) was not statistically
significantly different from zero, indicating no more deficit
accumulation with age at the highest levels of the FI.
The relationship between the death rate and baseline FI
scores was well represented by logistic curves for each
follow-up interval (Figure 2A). The death rate for those
who were healthiest at baseline (i.e. baseline FI = 0)
increased from 0.18 for the 2-year follow-up to 0.69 at 7
years. At each wave, 100% 2-year mortality was observed at
FI values close to 0.67 (i.e. the 2-year death rate from wave
1 to wave 2 was 100% when FI = 0.68; between waves 2
and 3 at wave 2 FI = 0.66, and after wave 3, when the wave
3 FI was 0.68). For the 7-year follow-up, 100% mortality
occurred at baseline FI values >0.45.
Kaplan­Meier survival analysis showed decreasing cu-
mulative survival probabilities for increasing FI (Figure 2B).
The proportional hazards analyses indicated that an indivi-
dual's deficit count, age and sex were significant predictors
of survival for baseline, 2-year and 4-year death data
(Supplementary data are available in Age and Ageing online,
Appendix C).
Discussion
In the CLHLS 1998­2005 data set, we quantified frailty in
people aged 80­99 years as the accumulation of deficits
and evaluated the behaviour of deficit accumulation in rela-
tion to mortality so that we could test whether a limit to
frailty was present. In this high-risk group of very old
adults, a 99% limit to frailty was observed at an FI value of
0.7, with little change in the shape of the distribution of the
FI over 7 years. Consistent with earlier analyses [14], we
observed deceleration in deficit accumulation in relation to
age with increasing FI scores. The data showed a consistent
and non-trivial increase in the death rate as a function of
the FI, as well as the expected acceleration in mortality at
each wave. Even so, in this evidently high-risk group of
very old adults, the hypothesised limit to frailty was never
exceeded.
In addition to the consistent limit, the distributions of
the FI wave were characteristically skewed [20] and showed
a marked decrease in the area under the curve with each
subsequent wave (Figure 1A). Despite the substantial
numbers who died with each subsequent wave, the

distributions of the FI values stayed about the same
(Figure 1B). Over 7 years, there was little change in the
mode, and a small decrease in the proportion of people
with FI = 0 (the so-called `zero state' of frailty). This
appears to reflect the nature of system failure and proper-
ties of the limit. Without a limit, it might be expected that
an increased mean FI would arise from the mode shifting
to the right and the maximum value approaching unity.
Instead, the distribution shows that even though there is a
small increment in the FI mode, and a small decrement in
people with FI = 0, there is no corresponding increase in
the proportion with the highest FI values. That is due to
complete mortality as the limit is approached (at 2 years,
with FI = 0.67). This is also in keeping with a report from
Canada on adults aged 70+ years at baseline [14].
As before, the average rate of deficit accumulation decel-
erated in relation to age as the FI increased [3, 14, 20]. In
other words, as respondents became frailer, they accumu-
lated deficits at a slower rate. This result supports the
concept of physiological redundancy exhaustion [13, 14],
understood as follows. Any system with a large amount of
accumulated damage can only tolerate a finite amount of
additional damage without failure. In consequence, slopes
of deficit accumulation in relation to age eventually attenu-
ate to zero because further deficit accumulation is not pos-
sible. This is not because of a lower risk of death, but
rather due to higher one: the alternative to further deficit
accumulation is less likely improvement than it is death.
Mortality, as it relates to frailty, has been examined in
CLHLS data before and showed, as here, that deficit
accumulation is tightly linked to the risk of death, indicating
that frail adults are more likely to die [11, 19]. What this
study adds is the exploration of the limit. Note too, that as
we used an older sample (the youngest respondents here
were 15 years older than in other CLHLS studies) the
death rates were notably higher, even for those fittest at
baseline and particularly for the 7-year outcomes. Another
recent report from China found a similarly high mortality
rate for adults aged 85 and older from the Beijing
Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) database [21]. These
reports suggest that at this age, at least in China during the
time periods observed, high levels of deficit accumulation
were lethal.
Our data must be interpreted with caution. The baseline
cohort included 36% who were centenarians, whom we

excluded from analysis. Additional analyses of this group
also showed a consistent limit to the FI at 0.7 (data not
shown); even so, the study of centenarians appears to be es-
pecially susceptible to local influences, sex compositions
and familial effects, making generalisation uncertain [22, 23].
For these reasons, we have focused on this more restricted,
but still very elderly sample. The data also chiefly come
from self or informant reports, although in work on other
aspects of the FI, we have found no difference between esti-
mates based on self-reported, observer-assessed or test
data, as long as the usual criteria for selecting health deficits
are applied [24]. Despite these limitations, important proper-
ties of the FI (high correlation with age, highly associated
with mortality and a submaximal limit at 0.7) held here [1, 3,
11, 24­28]. Many readers will be more familiar with frailty
defined by a frailty phenotype [29]. How these findings can
be applied to the phenotype requires additional investiga-
tion; the data here do not allow the phenotype to be identi-
fied. In any case, a recent report suggests that difficulties in
operationalising the frailty phenotype limit its utility in the
very old [30].
The high death rates and the empirical limit to frailty
have important implications for understanding health in
older adults. Previously, we have considered frailty chiefly in
younger samples (mostly 55+ years) from several nations.
Important properties of frailty observed there also seem to
hold here. Notable results of this study include what did
not happen in a large sample with a high mortality rate; the
distribution changed little and the limit was not exceeded.
Instead, with time, fewer people survived and even fewer
had little wrong with them. Especially for healthcare deliv-
ery systems which view as normative patients with just one
single illness, as exemplified in ideas such as diagnostic par-
simony and the `most responsible diagnosis', this increase
in frailty will pose important challenges. The FI quantifies
the vulnerability to adverse outcomes of people with many
health problems. It also affords a systems approach to
frailty, allowing a fuller understanding of patients with
complex needs.
Key points
· We evaluated the relationship between the FI and mortal-
ity during 7 years of follow-up in very elderly Chinese
people.
· We showed that the statistical distribution of the FI
changed little over time, even at a high mortality rate.
· We demonstrated a limit to the number of health deficits
that people can tolerate, estimated by a FI = 0.7.
