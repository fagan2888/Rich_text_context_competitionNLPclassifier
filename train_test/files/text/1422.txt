Factors

Infection with Toxoplasma gondii can cause severe illness when the organism is contracted congenitally or
when it is reactivated in immune-suppressed persons. To determine the prevalence of T. gondii infection in a
representative sample of the US population, the authors tested sera from participants in the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­1994) for immunoglobulin G antibodies to T. gondii. Of 27,145
persons aged 12 years, 17,658 (65%) had sera tested. The overall age-adjusted seroprevalence was 22.5%
(95% confidence interval (CI): 21.1, 23.9); among women aged 15­44 years, seroprevalence was 15.0% (95%
CI: 13.2, 17.0). Age-adjusted seroprevalence was higher in the Northeast (29.2%) than in the South (22.8%),
Midwest (20.5%), or West (17.5%) (p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, risk for T. gondii infection increased with
age and was higher among persons who were foreign-born, persons with a lower educational level, those who
lived in crowded conditions, and those who worked in soil-related occupations, although in subset analyses risk
categories varied by race/ethnicity. Nearly one quarter of adults and adolescents in the United States have been
infected with T. gondii. Most women of childbearing age in the United States are susceptible to acute infection
and should be educated about ways to minimize exposure to T. gondii. Am J Epidemiol 2001;154:357­65.

Toxoplasmosis is a disease caused by the protozoal par-
asite Toxoplasma gondii. Newly acquired T. gondii infec-
tion in a pregnant woman can be transmitted to the fetus
and may cause mental retardation, blindness, epilepsy, and
death. T. gondii can also cause severe encephalitis via acute
infection or reactivation of latent infection among immune-
suppressed persons, including those with acquired immuno-
deficiency syndrome, those with immunosuppressive can-
cer, and transplant recipients on immunosuppressive drugs.
Toxoplasmosis is the most frequent severe neurologic
infection among persons with acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (1). However, adults with normal immune func-
tion are usually asymptomatic or have symptoms such as
fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy that resolve sponta-
neously. Estimates of the incidence of congenital infection
in the United States range from 400 per year to 4,000 per
year (2), but because toxoplasmosis is not a nationally
reportable disease, the true magnitude of disease is not
known. The annual economic impact of toxoplasmosis in
the United States is estimated to be $7.7 billion (3).
Most T. gondii infections among humans occur in one of
three ways: 1) by eating raw or undercooked meat contain-
ing T. gondii tissue cysts or eating food that has been cross-
contaminated with raw/undercooked meat; 2) by ingesting
oocysts from soil (for example, through gardening, han-
dling/eating unwashed vegetables, or changing a cat litter
box); or 3) by acquiring congenital infection through the
placenta. Of the estimated 750 deaths caused by toxoplas-
mosis in the United States each year, 375 are thought to
occur from eating raw or undercooked meat; this makes tox-
oplasmosis the third-leading cause of US foodborne death
(4).
Recent epidemiologic studies have identified the follow-
ing risk factors for T. gondii infection: owning cats (5);
being in proximity to seropositive cats in farming areas (6);
cleaning the cat litter box (7); eating raw or undercooked
pork, mutton, lamb, beef, or mincemeat products (5­8); gar-
dening (6); having contact with soil (8); eating raw or
unwashed vegetables or fruits (5); eating raw vegetables
outside the home (5); washing kitchen knives infrequently
(7); having poor hand hygiene (5); and traveling outside of
Europe, the United States, and Canada (8). However, own-
ing a cat was not shown to be a risk factor for T. gondii
infection in two studies of pregnant women (8, 9) or in a
study of persons infected with human immunodeficiency
virus (10). Protective factors include adhering to a meat-free
diet (11), living at a high altitude or in an arid climate (12,
13), and living in a climate with frequent freezing and thaw-
358 Jones et al.

ing (14). Outbreaks of toxoplasmosis have been attributed to
ingestion of raw or undercooked ground beef, lamb, pork, or
venison (15­20); consumption of unpasteurized goat's milk
(21); and exposure to contaminated water (22, 23), soil (24),
or aerosolized soil (25).
High T. gondii seroprevalence has been found in countries
(such as France) where undercooked meat is commonly
eaten (26, 27) and in tropical areas of Latin America or sub-
Saharan Africa where cats are abundant and the climate
favors survival of oocysts (12, 28­34). For example, in
France, a seroprevalence of 71 percent has been found
among pregnant women (26, 27). In Panama, seropreva-
lence has been reported to be 13 percent by age 6 years (29)
and 90 percent by age 60 years (30). Seroprevalence has
been reported to be 78 percent among pregnant women in
Ibadan, Nigeria (34), 44 percent among persons living in the
drier regions of Somalia (12), and 83 percent in the popula-
tion of the South Delta in Nigeria (12). Researchers working
in Panama (where meat was well cooked) found that there
was a rapid rise in seroprevalence during childhood that
probably reflected soil exposure to T. gondii oocysts (30).
On the other hand, extrapolation from a study of women of
childbearing age in France showed that the risk of being
infected with T. gondii was the same throughout life (35).
Studies carried out in Scandinavian countries (36­38) and in
England (39) have shown lower seroprevalence.
To our knowledge, the prevalence of T. gondii infection in
the general US population has not been previously reported.
We present here the results of T. gondii serologic testing
done on a representative sample of the US general popula-
tion selected in the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
NHANES III was a cross-sectional survey conducted by
the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention between 1988 and 1994. It
was designed to obtain nationally representative statistics on
a variety of health measures and conditions through house-
hold interviews, standardized physical examinations, and
collection of blood samples in mobile examination centers
(40). NHANES III was based on a stratified, multistage,
probability cluster design from which a sample representa-
tive of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population aged
2 months or older was drawn. Persons aged 60 years, chil-
dren aged 2 months through 5 years, Mexican Americans,
and Blacks were sampled at higher rates than other persons
to assure an adequate sample size for these age, racial, and
ethnic groups. Detailed descriptions of the design of the sur-
vey and the sample have been published elsewhere (40).
Surplus sera from a representative sample of persons
aged 12 years were available for testing for antibodies to
T. gondii. Sera were also tested for a limited number of
children aged 1­5 and 6­11 years for whom sera were
available. Because of the limited availability of sera from
children, these groups represent convenience samples
rather than random subsets of children aged <12 years;
therefore, we cannot assume that they are representative of
the US population. Nevertheless, for completeness, we pre-
sent the data for children aged <12 years in a figure show-
ing seroprevalence by age and sex.
Race/ethnicity was defined by self-report as non-Hispanic
White, non-Hispanic Black, or Mexican-American. Persons
who did not self-select into one of these three groups were
classified as "other" and were analyzed only within the total
population. Multivariate analyses were conducted for per-
sons aged 20 years or older, because some important pre-
dictor variables (education and occupation) were only
applicable to this age range. Age was grouped as 20­29,
30­39, 40­49, 50­59, 60­69, and 70 years and was entered
into logistic regression models using these categories. A sep-
arate logistic regression analysis was carried out for persons
aged 12­19 years, excluding education and occupation. A
poverty index was calculated by dividing total family
income by the US poverty threshold, adjusted for family
size. A crowding index was calculated by dividing the total
number of rooms in a household (excluding bathrooms) by
the number of household residents; it was expressed as num-
ber of persons per room, and the variable was categorized as
<0.5, 0.5­0.99, and 1.0 persons per room. Education was
measured as the last year of schooling completed and was
grouped into four levels (no high school, some high school,
high school completion, some college) for entry into all
logistic regression models. Residence in a central county
with a population of 1 million was defined as metropolitan
residence; residence in all other counties (including rural
areas) was defined as nonmetropolitan residence.
Working in a soil-related occupation was defined by the
longest-held job and included farm workers, farm operators,
farm managers, and related agricultural occupations.
Because NHANES III was not specifically designed to
study T. gondii seroprevalence, no other data on soil expo-
sure variables were collected. Meat consumption was deter-
mined from average consumption over the past month and
included bacon, sausage, luncheon meat, liver and other
organ meat, beef, pork, chicken, and turkey. Average meat
consumption was grouped into categories of none, 1­15
servings per month, 15­30 servings per month, and >30
servings per month.
Laboratory testing
All specimens were analyzed during the years 1991­1995
using the Platelia Toxo-G immunoglobulin G enzyme
immunoassay test (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur, BioRad,
Hercules, California), according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Results were reported in International Units
(IU); samples with >6 IU were considered positive for T.
gondii immunoglobulin G antibodies. Prior to initiation of the
study, the Platelia Toxo-G kit was evaluated using a battery of
90 sera (23 negative and 67 positive) with various titers in the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Toxoplasma
immunofluorescence assay­immunoglobulin G test.
Specificity was 100 percent; sensitivity was 95.5 percent. The
three specimens with discrepant results (immunofluorescence
assay-positive, Platelia-negative) were analyzed by means of
the dye test (Dr. Jack Remington, Palo Alto, California) and
Toxoplasma gondii in the United States 359
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 154, No. 4, 2001
found to be dye test-negative; thus, the sensitivity of the
Platelia Toxo-G kit was actually 100 percent in this group of
specimens.
Statistical analysis
All estimates were weighted to represent the total US
population and to account for oversampling and nonre-
sponse to the household interview and physical examination
(41, 42). Statistical analyses were conducted using
SUDAAN, a family of statistical procedures for analysis of
data from complex sample surveys (43). Prevalence esti-
mates were age-adjusted by the direct method to the 1980
US population when seroprevalence was compared across
population subgroups.
To screen for possible predictors of T. gondii seroposi-
tivity, we evaluated differences in seroprevalence without
correcting for multiple comparisons, by examining the 95
percent confidence intervals for the seroprevalence values
generated by SUDAAN. We determined p values from a
general linear contrast procedure in SUDAAN, using a uni-
variate t statistic. Independent predictors were further
determined by means of multivariate logistic regression.
For persons aged 20 years, modeling was conducted for
the combined population and for each racial/ethnic group
(non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Mexican-
American). Subset analyses were conducted in persons
aged 12­19 years (all three racial/ethnic groups) and, for
Mexican Americans, persons aged 20­59 and 60 years.
Variables that had a Satterthwaite-adjusted F statistic with
a p value  0.05 were considered significant. A reduced
model containing only those cofactors that were considered
independent predictors of T. gondii seropositivity for at
least one of the three racial/ethnic groups is presented indi-
vidually for each racial/ethnic group.
RESULTS
Of the 27,145 persons aged 12 years or older who were
selected for NHANES III, 75 percent (n  20,241) were
interviewed and underwent a physical examination, and 65
percent (n  17,658) had sera tested for T. gondii antibod-
ies. The availability of a specimen for antibody testing
among those interviewed did not vary by age, race/ethnicity,
sex, poverty index, educational level, crowding, or other
characteristics included in our analysis (range, 77­83 per-
cent), except that it was somewhat lower (69 percent)
among persons aged 70 years. Previous analysis of
NHANES III data found that no apparent bias was intro-
duced by nonresponse (41).
As we noted above, the availability of sera for children
aged <12 years was limited. The availability of specimens
for all children under 12 with completed interviews ranged
from 30 percent to 35 percent when data were stratified
according to all important demographic cofactors, except
that availability was somewhat lower among non-Hispanic
Whites (27 percent) and higher among the foreign-born (45
percent) and those from the northeastern United States (43
percent).
The overall age-adjusted T. gondii seroprevalence for per-
sons aged 12 years was 22.5 percent (95 percent confi-
dence interval (CI): 21.1, 23.9). Among women of child-
bearing age (15­44 years), seroprevalence was 15.0 percent
(95 percent CI: 13.2, 17.0). For children aged 1­5 years, 21
percent (n  1,359) had sera available for testing and 3.7
percent were seropositive for T. gondii immunoglobulin G.
For children aged 6­11 years, 48 percent (n  1,819) had
sera available for testing, and 5.2 percent were seropositive
for T. gondii immunoglobulin G. Because the proportion of
children aged <12 years who had sera available for testing
was low, there is a greater potential for these estimates to be
biased. Regardless, these estimates will be useful "bench-
marks" with which to compare results of future studies in
this age group.
The age-adjusted seroprevalence of T. gondii was higher
in the Northeast (29.2 percent) than in the South (22.8 per-
cent), Midwest (20.5 percent), or West (17.5 percent) (p <
0.05; table 1). Seroprevalence was similar for males and
females by age group, except among persons aged 30­39
years, where it was somewhat higher for males (p  0.02)
(figure 1). Age-adjusted seroprevalence did not differ signif-
icantly by racial/ethnic group; however, seroprevalence did
vary by race/ethnicity within specific age groups (figure 2).
Age-adjusted seroprevalence differed significantly by educa-
tion (in the combined population, among non-Hispanic
Whites, and among MexicanAmericans) and by birth outside
of the United States (all groups except non-Hispanic
Whites). Age-adjusted seroprevalence also differed signifi-
cantly by household crowding (combined population and
Mexican Americans), poverty (combined population and
non-Hispanic Whites), soil-exposed occupation (all groups
except non-Hispanic Blacks), and cat ownership (Mexican
Americans only). Age-adjusted seroprevalence did not differ
significantly by sex, residence in a metropolitan area, or con-
sumption of meat in the past 30 days (table 1).
In the overall multivariate model for persons aged 20
years or older, T. gondii seroprevalence was significantly
lower among Mexican Americans (compared with non-
Hispanic Whites) and among persons living in the West,
Midwest, and South (compared with the Northeast) (table
2). Seroprevalence was significantly higher among those in
the age groups 40­49 years and above, those who had not
been born in the United States, those living in more crowded
conditions (1 persons per room vs. <0.5 persons per room),
those with less than some college education, and those who
worked in soil-related occupations (table 2). In the overall
multivariate model, seroprevalence did not vary signifi-
cantly by sex, socioeconomic level, metropolitan area, cur-
rent amount of meat in the diet, or cat ownership (table 2).
There were significant interactions between race/ethnicity
and age, education, country of birth, occupation, cat owner-
ship, and metropolitan residence; therefore, we present
results from reduced models for each of the three racial/
ethnic groups that contain only those variables that were sig-
nificant predictors of T. gondii seropositivity for at least one
of the racial/ethnic groups (table 3). Among non-Hispanic
Whites, four age categories, less education at all three
levels, birth outside of the United States, and history of

12 years of age (), seroprevalence estimates are unstable because of low sample representation in these categories.

employment in an occupation involving soil exposure were
all associated with increased risk for T. gondii seropositivity
(table 3). Among non-Hispanic Blacks, significantly higher
risk for T. gondii seropositivity was associated with four age
categories, with having no education/elementary education
or some high school education as compared with some col-
lege, and with birth outside of the United States. In addition,
among non-Hispanic Black persons, lower seropositivity for
T. gondii was associated with living in a metropolitan area.
Among Mexican Americans, the two highest age categories,
no education/elementary education or some high school
education as compared with some college, birth outside of
the United States, and employment in an occupation involv-
ing heavy soil exposure were associated with increased risk
of T. gondii seropositivity. Current cat ownership was asso-
ciated with a reduced risk for T. gondii seropositivity among
Mexican Americans.
Subset multivariate analysis was carried out for persons
aged 12­19 years, excluding the occupation and education
variables. In this analysis, none of the risk factors for White
or Black persons reached statistical significance. Results for
Mexican Americans are described below.
Because the age curve for Mexican Americans had a dif-
ferent shape than the curve for the other two racial/ethnic
groups, with a flatting from ages 20­29 years through ages
50­59 years (figure 2), we conducted a subset analysis com-
paring the age groups 12­19 years (without education and
occupation), 20­59 years, and 60 years to examine how T.
gondii seropositivity risk factors might vary between these

was significantly increased only for foreign birth (relative
risk (RR)  8.20, 95 percent CI: 4.52, 14.86). Among
Mexican Americans aged 20­59 years, risk was increased
for foreign birth (RR  2.16, 95 percent CI: 1.77, 2.64) and
for some high school education compared with some college
education (RR  1.46, 95 percent CI: 1.01, 2.11); risk was
decreased for cat ownership (RR  0.58, 95 percent CI:
0.38, 0.87). In the 20- to 59-year age range, none of the 10-
year age categories were significantly associated with risk
(for ages 30­39 years, RR  0.89; for ages 40­49 years,
RR  0.88; and for ages 50­59 years, RR  0.99, in com-
parison with ages 20­29 years). Among Mexican Americans
in the age group 60 years, foreign birth (RR  1.69, 95
percent CI: 1.15, 2.48) and crowding (1 persons per room
as compared with <0.5 persons per room) (RR  1.84, 95
percent CI: 1.04, 3.27) were the only two factors associated
with risk for T. gondii seropositivity.
DISCUSSION
We found an overall age-adjusted T. gondii seropreva-
lence of 22.5 percent, and among women of childbearing
age we found a seroprevalence of 15.0 percent. These results
indicate that the United States is a country with low T.
gondii seroprevalence in comparison with other nations
such as France (26, 27) and many countries in Latin
America or sub-Saharan Africa (12, 28­34). The relatively
gradual increase in seroprevalence associated with age sug-
gests that soil exposure, which is greatest during the child-
hood years, may not be the principal mechanism by which
persons are exposed to T. gondii in the United States.
Therefore, a significant proportion of toxoplasmosis in this
country may be due to ingestion of raw or undercooked
infected meat or cross-contamination from such meat.
However, we cannot rule out a cohort effect, with there
being a higher risk for T. gondii infection in the past, as an
explanation for the age trends. Risk for T. gondii infection is
likely to have been higher in the past, because freezing of
meat was formerly less common and because improved live-
stock rearing practices have led to a decline in toxoplasmo-
sis (which has been documented in pork (44)).
These data suggest that 85 percent of women in the
United States are susceptible to acute Toxoplasma infection
during the childbearing years, and therefore their infants are
susceptible to congenital toxoplasmosis. For this reason, it is
important that women of childbearing age, especially preg-
nant women, be educated about not eating raw or under-
cooked meat and using good cat feces- and soil-related
hygiene. Recommendations for preventing congenital toxo-
plasmosis among pregnant women have been published (2).
It is also important that persons infected with human
immunodeficiency virus and other immunosuppressed indi-
viduals be made aware of toxoplasmosis prevention guide-
lines. Recommendations for prevention of toxoplasmosis
among persons with human immunodeficiency virus have
also been published (45).
In 1962 and 1989, the prevalence of T. gondii infection was
examined among military recruits, with results of 14.4 per-
cent and 9.5 percent, respectively (46, 47). Approximately 80

percent of the recruits in the 1989 study (47) were men aged
17­20 years. For comparison, we examined men aged 17­20
years from our study population and found a T. gondii sero-
prevalence of 11.9 percent. This is consistent with the previ-
ous studies, although different types of serologic tests were
used for each of these studies.
We found the lowest T. gondii seropositivity among per-
sons residing in the western region of the United States. This
finding is consistent with the studies of military recruits (46,
47) and with the lower seropositivity previously found in
western cities (48). Previous studies have found a lower
incidence of T. gondii in hot, dry climates and at high alti-
tudes (12, 13). Although local rainfall varies, the western
region of the United States is generally drier than the East,
and it has many areas with higher altitudes (49). Therefore,
the climatic and topographic characteristics of the West may
explain the lower T. gondii seroprevalence found there. We
do not know why the Northeast had the highest seropreva-
lence in our population; it may be a consequence of food
preparation and eating practices. Regardless of the overall
seroprevalence for a region, there is likely to be wide varia-
tion within regions. However, the NHANES III sample was
not designed to obtain estimates for geographic areas
smaller than the four major regions of the United States.
Lower levels of education were associated with an
increased risk for toxoplasmosis in the overall and race/
ethnicity-specific logistic regression models. Lower levels
of education are associated with lower socioeconomic status
and may be related to employment in jobs with greater soil
exposure. In our analysis, soil-related occupations were also
independently associated with T. gondii seropositivity
among non-Hispanic Whites and Mexican Americans (table
3). There is some preliminary evidence from a population-
based survey done in seven states indicating that persons
with less education are not more likely to eat undercooked
hamburger, steak, roast, or pork (50). However, this same
survey found that persons with less education may be less
likely to wash cutting boards with soap or bleach after cut-
ting raw meat.
In the overall multivariate analysis, the risk for T. gondii
seropositivity was lower among Mexican Americans (table
2). In the race/ethnicity-specific analysis, risk for T. gondii

seropositivity among Mexican Americans was not increased
in the age groups 30­39, 40­49, and 50­59 years as it was
among non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks
(table 3). We do not know why risk was not increased in
these age groups for Mexican Americans.
It is also notable that among Mexican Americans (and no
other group), current cat ownership was associated with
reduced risk for T. gondii seropositivity. Although in most
previous studies cat ownership has been associated with
either increased risk for toxoplasmosis/T. gondii seroposi-
tivity or no change in risk, one previous study found that
possession of cats decreased the risk for seropositivity (51).
In our overall multivariate results, current cat ownership did
not significantly change the risk for T. gondii seropositivity.
There are several possible reasons for this finding. The
NHANES III interview only inquired about current owner-
ship of cats. Persons who did not own cats at the time of the
interview may have owned them in the past. In addition, risk
of T. gondii infection in humans derives from exposure to
the feces of a cat that is shedding oocysts. Cats generally
shed oocysts for only a few weeks during their lives. Cats
that are kept indoors, do not hunt, and are not fed raw meat
are not likely to acquire T. gondii infection and therefore
pose little risk to humans. In addition, neighborhood or feral
cats that defecate in gardens or sandboxes may pose the
greatest risk of T. gondii infection for some people, regard-
less of whether they own a cat.
Higher seroprevalence of T. gondii infection was found
among foreign-born persons in all three major racial/ethnic
groups in multivariate analysis. Reasons for high T. gondii
seroprevalence vary in different countries and are related to
the amount of T. gondii in meat, food-preparation and eating
habits, and exposure to soil and cat feces. We did not have a
sufficient number of cases to examine risk associated with
birth in individual countries or regions outside of the United
States. It is notable that in London, Gilbert et al. (52) found
a higher incidence of acute symptomatic Toxoplasma cho-
rioretinitis among Blacks born in West Africa than among
people born in Britain.
Meat consumption in the past 30 days was also not a sig-
nificant predictor for T. gondii seropositivity in our analysis.
However, very few persons in our study population ate no
meat (n  89), so our power to examine meat consumption
was limited. Because NHANES III was not designed as a
study of T. gondii seroprevalence, there were no questions
asked in the survey about how thoroughly meat was cooked.
In addition, the NHANES III questionnaire only inquired
about meat consumption within the 30 days prior to the
interview, not about meat consumption prior to that time.
Residence in a metropolitan area with less than 1 million
persons was significantly associated with T. gondii seropos-
itivity only among non-Hispanic Blacks (table 3). We
attempted to examine seropositivity further in persons from
areas with populations under 250,000, but the limited num-
ber of strata and primary sampling units in the NHANES III
sample limited our power to detect differences associated
with smaller metropolitan areas or with rural residence. One
previous study showed higher T. gondii seropositivity
among persons who grew up in rural areas in the United
States (47), but another study failed to show a difference
between rural and urban seroprevalence (46). NHANES III
only collected information about current residence, not
about past living locations.
There are a number of limitations involved in using data
from the NHANES III survey to evaluate T. gondii sero-
prevalence. NHANES III was designed to collect informa-
tion on a wide variety of risk factors for chronic diseases; it
was not designed to evaluate T. gondii risk factors and sero-
prevalence. Surplus serum samples were examined for T.
gondii antibodies. As we noted above, only a limited num-
ber of surplus samples were available for children under age
12, so it cannot be assumed that these samples are represen-
tative of the US population. NHANES III data were also
limited in terms of the information provided about soil
exposure and pet exposure. It would be helpful for T. gondii-
related studies if future NHANES surveys contained addi-
tional questions about cat- and soil-related risk factors.
Despite these drawbacks, NHANES III has provided us
with a way to assess the prevalence of T. gondii infection
and has enhanced our understanding of the seroepidemiol-
ogy of this organism in the United States. We plan to con-
tinue monitoring T. gondii seropositivity in future NHANES
surveys.
