Prelude: Exploding Brains
There is a silly thing I sometimes say when I'm teaching.
Probably I've been saying it for far too long but I still get
laughs, which I enjoy, so I keep making the joke. I don't
make the joke just because I get laughs. Students don't laugh
because the joke is especially humorous. They laugh, I sus-
pect, because what I say is apt; it accurately describes our
shared embodied experience of confusion and overwhelm
when faced with complex ideas and experiences. And
because laughing at the joke gives us an unexpected chance
to release built-up tension, it clears space so we can share a
small moment of relaxation before we dive back into the
complexity.
The setup for the joke happens something like this: A stu-
dent (and I should state explicitly that the majority of my
students are "adult learners" and predominately women;
they've returned to formal education in their full-on adult-
hood, even their "mature years," to complete an undergradu-
ate degree or begin a graduate degree) will be lamenting a
particularly difficult reading assignment (usually something
theoretically substantial) or discussion topic (usually some-
thing theoretically substantial!), complaining about the
impenetrability of the ideas and how they'll never be able to
get their minds around "this stuff," describing vividly the
excruciating pain involved in stretching their minds and
thinking deeply. I listen closely to their plaintive cries and
while quite sympathetic, at some point I can't resist asking,
"Does your brain feel like it is going to explode?" And my
students always respond with "Yes!" and then they laugh, to
which I reply with something along the lines of, "Good!
That's exactly the experience I was hoping you'd have. If
your brain doesn't feel like it is going to explode once in the
while then we aren't doing our jobs!"
Sometime, the joke has been known to turn into a strange
compliment. It might happen this way: A student stays some-
thing particularly insightful or innovative for him or her, and
in response I exclaim, "Everybody out of the way! What you
said is so amazing my brain is about to explode!"
I never once imagined that my mother's brain--or mine,
for that matter--could explode for real.

Transforming Trauma Through Reflection
and Praxis: Embracing the Principles of
Critical Educational Gerontology Life-
Wide
Jennifer R. Sasser1
Abstract
What happens when the issues of the human condition one has been teaching and theorizing about become issues in one's
life-world, even become a totalizing force that seeps through the boundaries around and between the "personal" and
the "professional?" What happens when one is not only teaching about the challenges of grown-up-hood, balancing adult
relationships, family caregiving, work responsibilities, and personal development but is suddenly faced with an event which
forces one to confront competing responsibilities and make meaning of an existential emergency? In this hybrid essay--a
combination of mini-memoir, testimony, and scholarly discourse--my central preoccupation is an unexpected crisis and how
I engaged the possibilities and limitations of my professional knowledge as an educational gerontologist with a commitment
to Critical Theory and came to more fully embrace the principles of Critical Gerontology, intentionally dissolving the
boundaries between "work" and "life."

Preamble: Commitments and Contexts
My central preoccupation in this essay is a significant, unex-
pected event from my "non-academic" life: An aneurysm
ruptured in my mother's brain. I explore my experience of
this event from the standpoint of being her adult daughter
and primary family caregiver as well as a mother to my own
daughter and an educational gerontologist with a commit-
ment to the use of Critical Theory. I celebrate the primacy
and legitimacy of individual and shared experience and the
transformative potential of solitary and communal critical
reflection on experience. I offer an episodic narrative of my
mother's and my experience as an example of age autobio-
graphical work (Gullette, 2003), a kind of critical
Gerontological "case study" of the ongoing, messy process
of working through and transforming trauma into deeper
albeit partial and provisional understanding.
For more than two decades (longer than half my lifetime),
my intellectual commitments have been informed by the
Critical Gerontology framework, an alternative approach to
Gerontological education, theory-work, research, and
practice.
Resisting neat categorizations and extending provocative
notions from Deleuze and Guattari, Katz (2003) referred to
Critical Gerontology as "a pragmatic and nomadic thought-
space across which ideas flow and become exchanged . . . a
magnetic field where thought collects, converges, and tra-
verses disciplines and traditions" (p. 16). According to Ray
(2008), within this critical Gerontological thought-space,
two "parallel lines" have developed over the past 30 years:
the political economy approach which foregrounds the social
structures that construct and affect aging, old age, and later
life; and an approach informed by the humanities which fore-
grounds individual experiences and processes of meaning-
making in adult aging. Although my cross-disciplinary
education and work as a gerontologist has been primarily in
the context of the human sciences disciplines, I have spent a
large portion of my life involved in the arts, specifically
music, dance, and theater. In this essay, I am self-consciously
situated in this disciplinary mash-up and while sensitive to
social constructions of and structural constraints on experi-
ence, I am walking the critical Gerontological line that privi-
leges exploration of and reflection on individual experiences
as a source of knowledge about our travels through the life
course.
What holds critical gerontologists together as a commu-
nity of scholars, teachers, and practitioners, whichever "line"
one is enacting, is a shared commitment to several strong
principles: (a) the importance of acknowledging and bridg-
ing the biographical and the historical, the personal and
political, and social structures and individual agency; (b) the
commitment to critically reflecting upon and thinking about
self, society, and the field of gerontology itself; (c) the privi-
leging of collaborative theorizing, not only with other schol-
ars and educators but also with students and especially with
older persons, the very subjects of--and potential partners
in--inquiry; (d) the commitment to grappling intentionally
with--rather than attempting to simplify or reduce--the
complexities of what it means to be a human being; and (e)
the imperative that the ultimate outcome of our striving must
be a deeper understanding of lifelong human development
and aging in the service of personal, social, and cultural
transformation (Katz, 2003; Moody, 1988, 1993; Ray, 2008;
Zeilig, 2011).
What I consider to be especially powerful about Critical
Gerontology is that it serves as a meta-framework, a compre-
hensive sensibility within which to ask and pursue answers
to questions about the most complex features of our travels
through the life course as human beings because it recog-
nizes that who we are and the work we do in the world are
intertwined inexorably (Glendenning, 2000). And, most cru-
cially, it provides a lucid counter-argument to the narrow and
over-determining normative discourses and practices that
still dominate a great deal of the research and theory regard-
ing adult development and aging, later life and old age
(Biggs, 2003; Katz, 2003; Moody, 1993, 2008).
As I mature into my professional (and personal) life, I
have been moved deeply by provocative contributions from
Biggs (1999, 2005), Ray (2003), Gilleard and Higgs (2000,
2005), Hendricks (2003), and Katz (1996, 2003). Their work
has inspired me to turn the lens of Critical Gerontology back
upon myself, to ask probing questions, such as
What have I been doing all these years and why? What
motivates--even compels--my research and theorizing? How
has my personal life shaped and been shaped by my work in
gerontology (or age studies, as Margaret Gullette would have
it)? How has my sense of the field, and myself in it, changed
over time? What do I celebrate--and regret--about my scholarly
life and the progress of critical gerontology overall? What do I
see as the central issues for critical gerontologist in the future?
(Ray, 2008, p. 97)
I have been supported in my movement toward deeper
critical reflection and praxis especially by Biggs (2005) who,
in his discussion of research training for a critical sensibility
toward aging experiences, asserted quite boldly that "we
need, then, techniques by which to know ourselves and the
contexts in which we work" (p. S125). He continued, advo-
cating that
identifying multiple sources of empathic understanding such as
similar life events and attending to biography, oral history, and
testimonia may be used to enhance a will to understand. The
problems of . . . amnesia of depth, indicative of seduction by
simple states of mind, plus their undertow, the avoidance of
personal anxieties with age, point to a need for enhanced self-
reflection of this type. (p. S126)
I remain convinced of the relevance and power of the
Critical Gerontology ethos for my work-in-the-world, but
Sasser 3
something even more elemental has happened: I have
decided to take the principles of Critical Gerontology so seri-
ously as to try to live my daily life informed by them (not
only employ these principles in the context of my work as an
educational gerontologist). As well, I have decided to take
my lived experiences from the "rest of my life" so seriously
as to attempt to live my life as an educational gerontologist
by them. And so as a point of departure for exploring the
connections between the ways I think, the work I do, and
how I've responded to--recovered from, learned from, and
integrated--the particular kinds of grown-up-hood complex-
ities I've experienced over the past many years, I chose to
dwell for a time in the intense center of my experiences with
my mother. As well, consistent with the practices described
in the works of Gullette (1997, 2003), Ray (2000), and
Richardson (1997, 2004), I aspired to write from within and
(hopefully) out of the "muddle" (G. Bateson, 1972) created
by this crisis to (hopefully) a place of deeper understanding.
But my resolve was not enough, I needed the help of others,
their insights, mentoring, and compassion, to do so. Thus, I
also recommitted myself to a collaborative mode of work
whereby I invited anyone--colleagues, friends, family, stu-
dents, elders, even strangers--who was interested and will-
ing to think with me about the larger meanings and
implications of these and other life experiences and to offer
their own experiences for collaborative mulling-over as well.
This is a hybrid essay, a combination of mini-memoir and
scholarly discourse; perhaps it even qualifies as a "testi-
mony," because through the process of putting to words my
and my mother's experiences, I am "bearing witness to a cri-
sis or trauma" (Felman, 1995), so as to deeply question how
I might theoretically and pedagogically and personally make
use of these experiences, not only on behalf of my own and
other's deep development and intentional aging but also as
fecund material to enrich my teaching and praxis (Biggs,
2005; McFadden, 2008; Ray, 1999, 2003).
Testimonia: Trauma (and Glimmers of
Transformation)
Two weeks after she celebrated her 60th birthday and one
week after returning from a cruise to Mexico with her younger
sister, an undiagnosed aneurysm ruptured in my mother's
brain. She was driving from the library at the university where
I work to my house to meet me and my daughter for dinner
when her brain exploded. It was February 19, 2006, and I had
recently celebrated my 39th birthday, my daughter had cele-
brated her 10th birthday, and only recently, months before my
mother's aneurysm, we'd felt as though we were emerging
from a period in our lives that had been extraordinarily chal-
lenging, even traumatic, for all three of us.
In my own life throughout the previous decade, I had
experienced many unanticipated events that demanded of me
what felt like an almost constant process of adjustment and
adaptation, periods of recovery and reflection followed by
rebuilding of self and life-world. In the most recent months,
there had been my maternal grandmother's rapid decline and
near-death, followed by her equally rapid and unexpected
improvement. This grand woman, my only surviving grand-
parent, had been my "best person" throughout my growing-
up years, my unlimited source of unconditional positive
regard, and my model for the reality-bending possibilities of
curiosity, intent, will, and hopefulness. Driving 12 hours
through the middle of a frozen winter night, my mother and I
rushed to her so that we might be there in time to care for her
during what we thought were her final days on earth. When I
arrived at her bedside, I had no doubt that she was dying. I
climbed into bed and slept with her all night. In the morning,
my grandmother woke up, toileted, and dressed herself,
whereas I woke up vomiting and continued to do so for 2
days. This was a singular, beautiful experience, an unex-
plainable yet verifiable event. I was deeply shaken.
Also during the half-year prior to my mother's ruptured
cerebral aneurysm, there had been the unexpected and vio-
lent end of her second marriage and her first sustained expe-
rience of living alone. She and her first husband, my father,
married when they were both 18 years old, right before he
headed off to the Vietnam War; I was born 9 months later.
Three years later, my brother was born with severe and irre-
versible auditory and visual impairments caused by a con-
genital syndrome, the existence of which had been unknown
to my family prior to my brother's birth. Growing up, I had
played the steady, strong eldest child and helpmate to my
mother, as she was completely dedicated to my brother who
had so many needs, while at the same time dominated by my
father who also had so many needs. My mother struggled
with her own depression and fear and great self-doubt; it was
all she could do to cope with even the smallest of life's has-
sles. Until my brother left home in his early twenties, my
mother's daily reality--her identity, in fact--was organized
around the considerable responsibility of parenting a child
with significant impairments.
She'd been married to my father for 25 years and had
cared for my brother for 21 of those 25 years when, for the
first time in her life, she chose herself; the day after my
brother's 21st birthday my mother ran away from home.
Quite courageously, she walked away from life as she had
(and we had) known it, as she felt her responsibility to keep
our family together for my brother's sake was unnecessary
now that he was living on his own out in the world.
At the time, I was a 24-year-old married gerontology
graduate student. Like my mother, I'd married quite young,
enthralled with the idea of "true love," but also (I only real-
ized much later) because early marriage offered me an escape
from my intolerable native family situation. My mother and
I had been meeting for lunch a couple of times a month to
commiserate over our separate and shared woes. I'd known
for quite a while that something of significance was going on
with her as each time I saw her, she'd hand over to me
another small box of objects that were important to her, that
4 SAGE Open
she expected me to protect for her. I even suggested to her on
the occasion of one of these deposits with me of her senti-
mental objects that it seemed that she was "preparing for
flight." And so, when she phoned me and asked that I pick
her up and help her "run away from home" I wasn't too sur-
prised--I'd always wondered why she hadn't fled sooner--
though I was in shock because of what I could foresee as the
consequences of her actions. Indeed, the consequences were
numerous, significant, and lasting. My father felt betrayed by
my collusion with my mother and responded in extreme
ways; I felt caught in between my parents and unfairly relied
upon by my mother; my brother felt that his and our family's
entire life had been a lie.
After a few months, in between staying temporarily with
me or friends and for a very short while on her own, my
mother met and married her second husband, to whom she
was married for 13 years until the day after Mother's Day
2005 when she found herself truly on her own for the first
time in her entire life.
In the months that preceded the explosion in her brain, my
mother had gone a long way toward establishing a life as a
single, late "middle-aged" woman who'd already traveled
through the life course for several decades, to fully embrac-
ing her "third age" or "adulthood 2" with vitality and pur-
pose (M. C. Bateson, 2010; Gullette, 1997; Weiss & Bass,
2002). I'd helped her to acquire an apartment in the neigh-
borhood where my daughter and I are established; a friend
and I had moved her into the new place and had kept her
clear of her second husband. No longer focused on keeping a
struggling relationship together, she found that she had the
energy to think new thoughts and embrace new challenges.
With the approach of her 60th birthday, my mother had
decided it was the ideal time to pursue as many of her dreams
as she could: going back to school, training for a walking
marathon, building economic security, and developing cur-
rent and new friendships. Her decision to return to college--
in fact, to the university where I am on the faculty-- to
complete her undergraduate degree was to fulfill a lifelong
dream that had been disrupted so many years previously, a
dream that she shared with many of my students who are also
women returning to college in their mid-lives. Even without
a college degree, my mother had worked hard for over two
decades as a medical assistant in a managed care setting, pro-
viding a steady source of income in both of her marriages to
men who were chronically unemployed. Newly independent,
she described to me feeling an unfamiliar vitality, clarity, and
purposefulness; she said that she'd never felt "better or
younger" in her life, that for once her "insides and outsides"
matched, she felt her life had a coherence that she could get
used to and wanted to make last as long as possible.
From my vantage point as her adult daughter, she seemed
to me to be experiencing a fundamental shift in the substrates
of her identity, her very way of being in the world was trans-
forming. For what felt to me to be the first time in the almost
40 years I had been her daughter, she was expressing her
thoughts and feelings in a way that impressed me as repre-
senting some deeper truth that she'd carried around within
her for decades but never felt up to narrating. And she not
only expressed herself in an increasingly open and innova-
tive way, she also began--at least discursively--to assume
responsibility for her life choices in a way I was completely
unaccustomed to and wanted to put my faith in with a des-
peration that surprised and somewhat concerned me. I dis-
covered in myself a ferocious hope that her new habits of
thinking and being in the world would "stick." (And I must
admit here that I wanted this as much for my own sake and
the sake of my daughter as I did for my mother's sake.)
My mother was asking the kinds of questions that she'd
never allowed herself to ask before without being paralyzed
by fear, as if to ask such existential questions about the uni-
verse and her place in it would unleash uncontrollable and
destructive forces. I noticed that she was inventing wholly
new language to describe her current self, whom she aspired
to become, not only whom she'd been in her "past life."
Before my eyes, my mother, who for so many years had
seemed resistant to engaging in self-reflexivity and assuming
her own agency, was evidencing the possibility of the
"reversibility of discourses" about her life and self (Powell
& Biggs, 2003). For the first time in my life as her daughter,
I experienced her as a growing-up person, by which I mean
to say, she was exhibiting the sensibilities and characteristics
I had come to associate--theoretically and in my own strug-
gles with personhood--with grown-up-hood, an intentional
commitment to our own deep development and a purposeful
and responsible life, no matter how complex and "messy"
that life might be (Gullette, 1997). My mother seemed better
able to dwell with and negotiate the contradictions inherent
in her identity as an aging woman despite having few models
for doing so (Biggs, 2003).
All of this was jarring because of my unfamiliarity with
such maternal agency from the standpoint of being my moth-
er's daughter and it instigated for me yet another spiraling
phase in my own developmental journey. The innovations
my mother seemed to be making in her self and her life-
world were a source of new hope for me about potentialities
for her life and our life together as growing-up mother and
daughter as well as for the role she might play in my daugh-
ter's life as a grandmother. It felt strange to me witnessing
my mother's increasing independence as a woman, not only
as my mother. She was becoming . . . how to say it? Not so
much a new person but a larger and more solid person in the
world, an expanded mother who took up more space, a fuller
being.
Intensive Caring
It had been an arduous process convincing the attending
emergency room physician at the hospital where the ambu-
lance initially took my mother that in fact she was experienc-
ing a cerebral emergency. I arrived at her bedside to discover
Sasser 5
him accusing her of "drug seeking behavior" for what was
probably "just a bad migraine." The minute I looked at my
mother's face and heard her voice, I knew that she was expe-
riencing something more significant than a migraine head-
ache. I insisted that the neurologist on call be brought in for
consultation immediately. In response to my plea, the ER
physician said, "And you are?" To which I responded, "Her
daughter, Dr. Sasser_." He asked, "What kind of doctor"? I
said, "A gerontologist." To which he replied, "So you aren't
an MD. Well, I think we have this under control. We'll keep
an eye on your mother." To which I responded with mostly
incoherent wailing that fortunately resulted in the specialist
being paged and appropriate diagnostic imagining ordered.
The neurologist told me later that had he not been called to
the scene when he had, my mother most likely would have
died or been impaired severely and irreversibly.
Perhaps it is important to this story for you to know that
this hospital was part of the medical complex where my
mother had been working as a medical assistant for two
decades and where she received her routine medical care; she
knew almost everyone on staff in the ER, including the
attending physician. As if our experience in the emergency
room wasn't upsetting and shocking enough, my mother was
discharged too soon after her post-operation hospitalization,
resulting in a major set-back in her healing. As well, the
managed care system of which the hospital was a part
attempted to renege on their commitment to her as an
employee and client, threatening to deny her medical claims
and discontinue her relationship with the neurology special-
ist to whom they had referred her for surgery. This stubborn
institution gave us nothing but problems every step of the
way as I attempted to navigate it as her caregiver, with vary-
ing degrees of success and a great deal of exasperation. I
wonder, what fate might my mother have faced without me
there to advocate for her?
Once she was stabilized medically and waiting in the
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) prior to receiving the emergency
procedure to remove the blood that had pooled in her cranial
cavities and seal off the aneurysm with a coil made of tita-
nium, my mother's two preoccupations were, first, why this
terrible thing had happened to her especially now that she
had, as she put it, "gotten her act together," and second,
whether it would be possible for me to smuggle into the ICU
a hamburger and fries. During her stay in the hospital--first
in the ICU, then in the regular medical ward, and then when
she was recuperating under my care--her personality seemed
characterized by extremes. Elements of her best and worst
self co-existed: She was funny one moment, even uncharac-
teristically ironic, and the next moment, she was perseverat-
ing about something she couldn't remember or locate, such
as a pair of red and black socks that she feared had been left
at the hospital or the fact that her car was still parked at my
house rather than at her apartment and that it needed its bat-
tery recharged. Elements of my best and worst self battled:
At one moment, I was patient, empathetic, not easily ruffled,
completely fierce in my devotion to her; in the next moment,
I was barely able to suppress impatience, annoyance, fear
that my mother's current state would become her permanent
way of being in the world, that I would become her long-
term guardian. All I could think about was the absurdity of
worrying about lost socks when she was almost lost to the
world or changing the oil in her car when she had actually
crashed her car as she'd been driving when her brain
exploded.
I felt a strange kind of disappointment mixed with grief
because, as I have described, only months before the crisis
our relationship as growing-up daughter and mother began to
transform. We were reliant upon one another in new and bet-
ter ways; we occupied clearer and more "appropriate" roles
than ever before. I think we both thrived (as did my daugh-
ter) because of these hard-won innovations in our relation-
ship. And so I was jarred deeply by the incontrovertible fact
that this newfound stability, these new modes of being in the
world for my mother and for us, was being disrupted by an
event of such magnitude and consequence as a ruptured brain
aneurysm.
It would not be an exaggeration to say that I was in crisis.
There was a collection of thoughts that I perseverated on day
and night. These thoughts were surprisingly logical in form
while being emotionally intense in content: My mother
almost died but didn't; my mother didn't die but she might be
left with severe and lasting impairments; my mother seemed
to have some rather severe impairments and some of them
might or might not go away with time as her brain healed;
my mother was alive and here with me still, for which I was
thankful because I wasn't ready for her to leave the earth (I
wonder, are we ever really ready? What does it mean to be
ready?). Would I be able to sustain my energy and serve as
her caregiver for an unknown length of time? I had been a
caregiver for family members and others many times in my
life, so I had real and direct and cumulative experience. My
beginning in the field of gerontology, and one of the ways I
supported myself right after high school and during my
undergraduate years, was as a certified nursing assistant
working in nursing homes. I'd also had early training in my
family. So serving as my mother's caregiver in the aftermath
of her aneurysm wasn't a departure from my normative fam-
ily reality nor my early work roles; rather, it seemed consis-
tent with my past experiences, though of course also distinct
because of the magnitude and emergent nature of my moth-
er's health crisis, because it was going to be for an indefinite
length of time a totalizing force in both of our lives, and
because it happened with no warning in the middle of what
we were both experiencing as a gentler, calmer phase of our
life. Was I up to it, could I make it through another round of
taking care of my mother? And would my years of experi-
ence as an educational gerontologist with a commitment to
Critical Theory help me to navigate and manage this
6 SAGE Open
overwhelmingly complicated situation? Could I call upon
my "expertise" for dealing with complexity now when my
mother and I most needed it?
These and other thoughts looped through my mind as
reality narrowed and many of the central features of my life
got knocked into the background, especially the features per-
taining to my professional life. It was the middle of a term in
which I had a larger-than-usual collection of responsibilities:
teaching three advanced seminars, departmental administra-
tive duties including advising students and supervising fac-
ulty, university committee work, and outside professional
commitments and speaking engagements. In between tend-
ing to my mother and tending to my daughter, I made phone
calls and sent email messages, canceling and postponing,
deferring and apologizing. I asked human resources at the
university about the process should I need to take an indefi-
nite family leave of absence; in asking, I worried that I was
increasing my vulnerability as an associate professor and
department chair working without a contract nor tenure (the
university where I work does not have a tenure system and is
an "at-will" employer). I don't know how I did it but some-
how I managed to fulfill baseline professional obligations
that felt crucial or time-sensitive: reading student papers in
the hospital waiting room, answering email messages in the
middle of the night, calling in favors from my colleagues and
students, and asking them to extend to me their understand-
ing and benefit of the doubt during this time in which I was
disoriented and overwhelmed.
Perhaps as a way to manage the intense un-synthesizable
mixture of emotions I was flailing in, I started keeping a new
journal specifically devoted to recording everything that was
happening related to my mother's crisis. From the mundane
to the philosophical, I documented it in the little brown book
given to me by a concerned friend. On the inside cover, I
wrote the medical nomenclature for what had happened to
my mother--"sub-arachnoid hemorrhage"--and accompa-
nied the words with a drawing of an upside-down spider,
imagining that there was a huge red arachnid lodged supine
at the bottom of my mother's skull. I listed the many medica-
tions she would have to take every 2-4-6 hours 'round-the-
clock for an indefinite length of time, dispensed by me until
she might be able to monitor the elaborate system for herself.
I did a lot of free-writing about anything I could remember
from the weeks preceding the massive rupture, searching for
signs of the impending explosion (perhaps I was imagining
that I might have prevented it if had I been paying more
attention?) and I noted things my mother said and my obser-
vations of her condition. I kept lists of contact information
for all of the people who would need to know about what had
happen to my mother, bills that I'd need to pay for her, and
reminders to myself of my other responsibilities: my daugh-
ter's schedule or tasks at work that had to be completed by
me or by a proxy. I studied medical journal articles and took
notes about what had happened to her: the etiology of the
aneurysm, the symptoms and treatment and long-term
prognosis. I learned that such aneurysms are hereditary and
strike women more often than men and are often fatal or
result in permanent impairment. My initial impression was
confirmed that my mother had somehow beaten the odds of
this unexpected and devastating thing that had happened to
her.
I still don't quite understand how it was possible, but even
in the middle of my mother's crisis, and my own crisis that
was triggered by her crisis, I felt strongly that while this was
no doubt a traumatic and stressful experience, it was also a
potentially liminal event in our intertwined lives. I began to
see connections, the ways in which what I was thinking and
feeling about this experience seemed to relate to, even be
facets of, my long-standing preoccupations: the primacy of
personal experience as a legitimate basis for understanding;
the challenges and potentialities of deep adult development
and intentional aging; practices for transformative, emanci-
patory teaching and learning in adulthood; the complexities
of embodied consciousness and meaning-making in the far-
thest reaches of the human life course. I jotted notes to
remind myself of possible future inquiry and writing proj-
ects, about how I might use these emerging insights in my
teaching and work with my adult students. I felt questions
pouring out of me; I could barely keep up with them! As for
answers, if I had any, they were at best emergent, partial, and
provisional. I was experiencing my own metaphoric explod-
ing brain. My sense of what was important to me in my
work--no, not just in my work, but in every facet of my
messy life--was shifting. Key features of my identity were
being dismantled and reassembled in ways that I experienced
as deeply frightening and exciting. But just as I was uncer-
tain about whether I could fulfill my responsibility to my
mother as her caregiver as well as mother to my daughter, I
was uncertain as to whether I'd have the energy, courage, and
life-world support to enact my aspirations for my own per-
sonal and professional development.
I also wondered if my body was sound enough to carry me
through what I hoped would be a long journey through the
life course. One of my journal entries written during the ini-
tial days after my mother's emergency reflects my sudden
realization that my daughter and I might be walking around
with hidden cerebral aneurysms. I wrote, "Time bomb: Does
it exist? What will set it off? Is there one within me?" (At the
urging of my mother's surgeon, I had a magnetic resonance
imaging procedure [MRI] soon after her rupture; it indicated
the absence of any visible potential aneurysm in my brain;
my daughter asked to meet with her pediatrician to find out
whether she, too, should have an MRI). Faced with such
comprehensive uncertainty, I felt I had no choice but to write
through my experiences, from the coldly pragmatic lists to
what I now experience as heart-breaking passages about my
thoughts and feelings as I struggled through this experience
with my mother (and also with my daughter), one of the Big
Events of Life, a point of confluence where all the existential
features of life as a human being collide: frailty,
Sasser 7
impermanence, terror, suffering, love, hope. Writing became
a crucial, critical praxis through which I honored my confu-
sion, legitimized my own and my mother's (and my daugh-
ter's) embodied experiences, and reclaimed a sense of agency
over my life when so many aspects of it were out of my con-
trol (Ray, 2000; Richardson, 1997).
Magic Charm
After her brain exploded, while she was recovering in the
hospital and in a state of confusion punctuated by her emerg-
ing realizations of what had happened to her, especially
about how her life had been altered irrevocably, my mother
was frightened and in pain, unable to sleep. I felt as though I
was slammed right up against the limits of my ability to
encourage and comfort her. The pep talks I had given her
many times throughout our life together whenever her confi-
dence faltered or she was anxious now seemed quite banal.
My assurances that I loved her and that she was safe and that
I'd take care of her didn't seem to do much to reduce the utter
terror she felt. I couldn't be with her constantly while she
was in the ICU, though that is what she wanted, and while I
called her often when I wasn't by her side, phone conversa-
tions were very challenging for us because of the constant
pain in her head and auditory impairments as an aftereffect of
the aneurysm. I realized that what she needed was a strong
image or notion that she could hold onto, something she
could call up in her confused mind in the middle of the night
like a touchstone or a magic charm.
I remembered an "enticingly beautiful idea" from a tran-
script of a National Public Radio interview that one of my
colleagues had given me the week before my mother's aneu-
rysm. A pediatric researcher had demonstrated that "babies'
cells stay in their moms, not for days or weeks, but for
decades" and that these cells "protect, defend, and repair her
for the rest of her life whenever she gets seriously ill" (
Krulwich, 2006). I had my strong image around which to
create for my mother a simple, positive visualization: My
fetal cells, but in the form of little homunculi that looked just
like me, were coalescing around the site of my mother's
aneurysm, working day and night to make sure that her brain
was healing and there would be no further explosions.
A few days after my mother underwent the special proce-
dure to repair the aneurysm with a titanium coil, I read the
transcribed interview to her and then offered her the visual-
ization I had constructed, urging her to focus on the image of
tiny little me inside her brain whenever she felt anxious or
frightened. For a couple of days it worked like the magic
charm it was intended to be. Then, one night when she was
suffering from an intense migraine headache that was a sec-
ondary outcome of the trauma to her brain, she called me
weeping, repeating over and over again, "I've been looking
for you in my mind like I've been doing but now I can't find
you. You've disappeared."
Her sudden and qualitatively different dependency--the
immediacy of her existential vulnerability--devastated me
and called forth my deepest, fiercest protective impulses. I
became quite metaphysical. I assured her that I was in fact
there inside and beside her. Even if sometimes she was not
able to find me, I wasn't hiding, nor would I ever flee from
her. When she couldn't "see me," she only needed to breathe
deeply and know I was there like the air.
Living Theory
In my post-crisis recovery as I endeavor to transform trauma,
in my ongoing project to connect my "personal experiences"
with "critical Gerontological praxis" (Ray, 2003), I have
come to realize that it wasn't the event of my mother's health
crisis per se that was the point, and this hasn't been a story
about a bad thing that happened that caused me to decide to
do some things in my life differently because I realized (once
again) how precious and transient this life is. In an instant, a
brain explodes, a car crashes, a relationship comes to an
abrupt end or changes dramatically, something violent alters
reality in inconceivable and irreversible ways. For many of
us, time unfolds unpunctuated by such violent episodes of
crisis. We have the sheer good fortune of living in Western
advanced capitalistic countries during this historical epoch.
Most of our travels through the life course are paved with
good health and opportunities, at least when compared with,
say, those living in extremely marginal economies or in war
zones. Typically, our lives are not strewn with daily remind-
ers of our true nature as embodied humans, the profound
frailty we share regardless of how we are positioned in terms
of age, health, or ableness. As Gadow (1983) reminds us, we
are each of us as flesh vulnerable and dependent upon each
other. The inescapable fact is that each of us has one foot on
the earth and one foot in the stars.
It almost goes without saying that the work we do is
informed by the lives we live--and the lives we live are
hopefully informed by our work, as well--especially in a
field such as gerontology; but I've come to want something
more, a deeper and larger connection between my work and
the rest of my life. As I aspire to do for my students, so I have
been attempting to do for myself: I construct opportunities,
sometimes only momentary and sometimes sustained, for
engaging purposefully in critical reflection about and con-
templation of what I am experiencing and learning, and ways
I might enact my emerging understanding, make connections
between (and perhaps resist the boundaries around) the per-
sonal and the professional, my inside world and my life-
world, my experiences as a daughter, a mother, and a Critical
Educational Gerontologist living in a particular time/place
and space(s). In all honestly, I didn't come out of this experi-
ence with my mother with a sense of new personal coherence
or theoretical certitude or professional mastery. Instead, I
was broken wide open and in being broken and open I real-
ized that my only way through the accumulated trauma was
to embrace rather than flee from uncertainty and instability
and complexity. My relationship with Gerontological Critical
Theory became less abstract and more grounded in lived
8 SAGE Open
experience, my form of consciousness more "meta." The
"something new and good" that I hoped would emerge from
my experience caring for my mother during and after her cri-
sis began to take shape. I understood that a way to transform
trauma, my own and others', as well as dwell within the rich
messiness of my life, was through critical Gerontological
praxis in which I emancipated myself from the oppressive
expectations "in and out of academe, which dictate how we
should think, research, write about, teach, and otherwise con-
struct knowledge regarding age, aging, and age relations"
(Ray, 2003, p. 37).
New questions began to emerge and invite my sustained
attention: What are the social and ideological impediments
or challenges to our own and others'capacities for resilience,
adaptation, and growth as we travel through the adult life
course, and how do we address these structural issues and
enhance individual agency? What happens when I de-com-
partmentalize my life, when I resist the fracturing of my
identity that can result from occupying multiple, often dispa-
rate roles? What are intellectual and spiritual practices for
engaging the big questions of being human? Can we learn to
apply intentionality to deep development and aging without
the need for such brutal reminders of impermanence and fra-
gility? When these brutal reminders come into our lives, and
they will, how can we recognize them as opportunities for
personal growth, enhanced relationships with others, even
new modes of being-in-the-world?
In reflecting upon the extent to which my "expertise" as a
Critical Educational Gerontologist helped me cope with this
crisis, my commitment to Critical Gerontology deepened and
transformed. I came to realize that at heart, I am a
Gerontological-anarchist: I'm committed to freedom and
creativity as we travel through the life course more than I am
committed to the codification, standardization, and institu-
tionalization of ideas and practices around the human aging
journey. I simultaneously appreciate and see through the
desire to make the messiness of this human experience tidy.
The human journey is a complex, multifaceted process that
unfolds over a long period of time--if we are fortunate--
and, thus, invites and even demands a multifaceted, nuanced,
and critical approach. How could my work as a Critical
Educational Gerontologist devoted to this wild, emergent,
and complex phenomenon be anything less than wild, emer-
gent, and complex?
Interlude: Space and Time (September
2006)
I have written and re-written various sections of this essay at
different times over the span of several years. The day upon
which I wrote this interlude was almost 7 months to the day
since I heard the voicemail message from my mother. She
was calling from the roadside where she had crashed her car
to tell me she thought she was having a stroke or aneurysm.
I hadn't answered the call and so she left a message on my
cell phone. At the time of her call, I was in the bathroom
grooming myself in preparation for her expected arrival for
dinner. When I listened to the message, I was so shocked by
her slurred speech that I accidentally dropped the cell phone
into the toilet.
The site of the crash is on the route I drive from the neigh-
borhood where we live to the university where I work. Each
time I make the drive, I am reminded of the trauma we are
still living through. My mother returned to full-time work
out of necessity a few months after her ruptured aneurysm .
I'd have given just about anything if she could have taken
more time on medical leave not only to recover from the rup-
ture but also to engage in emotional healing and self-reflec-
tion, so that she might start the difficult work of integrating
this event into her sense of self. Instead, she's back to "nor-
mal" life but she feels anything but "normal." I received an
email message from her in which she wrote,
Yesterday was a particularly difficult day. Three huge errors
were brought to my attention at work. Last week I noticed that I
was more confused than usual . . . not sure why. My boss was
very kind about my errors but it threw me for a loop. I hope that
I can heal from this aneurysm before I cause harm to someone
and/or lose my job because I can't do it anymore. I am so
frustrated and sad. I am going to do as you suggested and be
very kind to myself and not stress too much.
Frustration, sadness, intermittent confusion, even some
anger, and resentment are emotion states that my mother
struggles with on a daily basis. But all of these feelings are
counter-balanced--I think, I hope--by a renewed sense of
gladness to be alive.
In addition to returning to full-time work, my mother
resumed many of the other activities of her "normal" life:
daily fitness walking, small trips to visit family and friends,
and active (though circumscribed) planning for her future.
The one activity she has decided not to resume is formal edu-
cation; she will not fulfill her dream of completing her under-
graduate degree. And there are new activities in my mother's
life. Every 6 months for the next several years, she will have
a diagnostic angiogram or an MRI to determine if the site of
the ruptured aneurysm is still stable.
The first round of these tests, 6-months-out from the cri-
sis, revealed that the site of the aneurysm was exposed, that
the titanium coil had compressed and my mother was at risk
for another rupture. This news was hard for us to take. The
odds were so small that something like this would happen
(close to as small as the odds that she'd experience and sur-
vive a ruptured aneurysm in the first place) and the conse-
quences of not fixing the rupture site could be serious, even
fatal. She scheduled the procedure immediately, wasting no
time and without consulting me. The date of her hospitaliza-
tion was the first day of Fall term at my university; in fact, it
was the first day I was scheduled to teach a new course. I
realized then in a way I hadn't fully realized during the initial
crisis that this was the "new normal" for us; my professional
Sasser 9
and personal responsibilities have some kind of significance
and importance but they have to be balanced indefinitely
with the reality of my mother's delicate embodiment. Our
shared reality has been altered; we mark the passage of time
based on how long it has been since the moment her brain
exploded.
Post-Script: Collaborative Moments
I had been working on this essay for some time before I
offered to read it to my mother, though before I got too far
underway with the writing of it, I asked her for her permis-
sion to put at its center our still-raw experiences. I've read
sections of this essay to students and friends and colleagues.
I've discussed its theoretical foundations with generous and
insightful colleagues in the United States and United
Kingdom. But when I was asked the year after the crisis to
offer a presentation at the continuing care retirement com-
munity ("CCRC") that is adjacent to the campus where I
work, I realized that this could be an opportunity to put into
praxis my Gerontological Critical Theory commitments,
especially my commitment to cross-generational collabora-
tive inquiry. More pragmatically, I hoped whoever attended
my presentation might offer me some much-needed help, as
at that time, this was an essay looking for an ending!
(Actually, I suspect I was looking for some resolution to the
tumultuous period my mother and I had experienced.)
I decided to do a "performance" of an earlier iteration of
this essay with an audience composed of elders living in the
CCRC and the surrounding community, administrators and
caregivers working at the CCRC, and faculty and students
from my university. I began the performance, which included
a reading of the essay followed by open discussion, by shar-
ing with the audience that the essay was a work-in-progress
that I'd been writing over several month (now over several
years!) and that it had come to a rather definite (though hope-
fully temporary) standstill. I told the audience that I simply
couldn't figure out how this essay wanted to end, though I
was definitely ready for it to end, and that I invited them to
collaborate with me in thinking through the possible forms
the ending might take. I also let them know that the process
of writing early versions of the essay had been a profound
experience for me because it is a testimony to a significant
life-crisis and an intentional effort to integrate this experi-
ence into my sense of self (as well as support my mother in
her efforts to do so as well). I hoped my mother's experience
and my experience with her would count for something,
would instigate something new and good.
The reading of the essay took about 45 minutes. It took
place in a dark dining room without a functioning micro-
phone system; there had been a bad storm with high winds
and, as a consequence, a power outage. As I read the essay,
as I projected my voice so all could hear, including those
audience members with hearing impairments, my throat
became dry and strained. I was quite shaken by the emotional
and physical effort it took to make it through reading the
essay under such conditions. I had tears in my eyes. I was
covered with nervous sweat and exhausted. I felt vulnerable
as I'd never before revealed so much of myself and my life in
such a public venue, nor had I ever delivered this style of
presentation.
At the conclusion of reading the essay, I left the protection
of the podium and ventured out into the large audience. I
asked, "So, what do you think? How does this essay wish to
end?" One of my close colleagues laughed as she
suggested,
"Maybe you should end the essay by telling about how after you
heard the message from your mother where she told you she
thought she was having a stroke you were so shocked you
dropped your cell phone in the toilet!"
Anew student at my university whom I'd yet to meet said,
with tears in her eyes,
"I'm very surprised and moved by what you've just read. I can't
believe what you and your family have lived through. It is very
brave of you to share all of that with us. I hope you and your
mom will be okay."
A woman who lives at the CCRC asked me if I was doing
okay, if I was eating well and taking care of myself, if I had
a faith tradition to bolster me in times of trouble, and if I was
still scared and sad. Other audience members related stories
about their own losses and existential concerns: spouses who
had died suddenly or tragically, adult children who were suf-
fering with mental illness, other unexpected life crises that
they had survived. We exchanged poignant stories for some
time and then I asked the audience yet again for advice as to
how this essay might wish to end. Another woman who lives
at the CCRC said something that has stayed with me and has
been borne out in subsequent months and years in my experi-
ences as my mother's daughter. She said, in a very quiet
voice, that only I and a few others could hear, "I don't think
there can be an ending for such a thing. I think you need to
accept that there is no ending, that it is an unfolding story."
Acknowledgments
Versions of this manuscript have been read to or by various col-
leagues, students, friends, and presentation/cooperative inquiry
group participants, many of whom took seriously my invitation to
"think together" and offered me gracious and keen feedback as well
as stories of their own. Thank you especially to Critical Gerontology
colleagues in the United Kingdom and North America, especially to
my mentor Dr. Harry R. Moody, all of whom were willing to dis-
cuss with me various ideas explored in this essay. Simeon Dreyfuss
believed in this essay when I did not, reading and offering expert
and inspiring editorial suggestions many times over. It would have
been virtually impossible for me to have had the time and space
necessary for thinking and writing about the ideas herein had my
university not granted me a 1-month paid leave in 2006 for faculty
10 SAGE Open
professional development and in 2010, a Faculty Innovation and
Excellence grant. And, of course, I must acknowledge my mother,
who courageously allowed me to write about significant features of
her life story.
