Abstract
Objective: To investigate the regulation mechanism of T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3
(Tim-3) combined with toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) or TLR4 on antiviral immune and inflammatory
response in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.
Methods: Patients with chronic HCV infection and healthy control subjects were recruited.
Patients received interferon (IFN)-a based therapy. Plasma galectin-9 (Gal-9) was quantitated.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured with TLR3 or TLR4 agonists, alone or
in combination with Tim-3 antagonist. Levels of IFN-a, TNF-a, and 20-50 oligoadenylate synthetase
(20-50OAS), myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) and suppressor of cytokine 1 (SOCS1) RNA in
PBMC cultures were evaluated.
Results: Plasma Gal-9 levels were increased in patients (n ¼ 52) compared with controls (n ¼ 20)
and significantly declined at treatment week 12 and 24 weeks post-treatment. IFN-a, 20-50OAS,
MxA, TNF-a and SOCS1 were upregulated by TLR3 and TLR4 agonists. TNF-a and SOCS1 levels
were suppressed by the addition of Tim-3 antagonist.
Conclusions: Tim-3 blockade in combination with TLR activation induces the expression of
antiviral molecules without a significant increase in TNF-a or SOCS1.

Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects
around 185 million people worldwide.
Chronic HCV infection can lead to liver
fibrosis with occult progression ­ a leading
cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer, and an
indication for liver transplantation.1 Direct-
acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have
improved the rate of sustained virological
response, but patients remain at risk of
disease progression.2­3 Enhanced under-
standing of HCV­host interactions is
required to combat this virus and to develop
improved therapies.4
The activation of the sentinel toll-like
receptor (TLR) system is an important
triggering event in the initial immune
defense, inducing both innate and adaptive
immunity by recognizing pathogen-asso-
ciated molecular patterns (PAMPs).5­6
TLR signaling pathways are strictly
co-ordinated by several mechanisms to regu-
late adequate innate immune responses.7­9
Agonists can induce type I interferon (IFN)
and antiviral molecules such as 20-50 oligoa-
denylate synthetase (20-50OAS) via the Janus
kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activa-
tor of transcription (STAT) pathway.
Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)
family proteins, originally identified as
negative-feedback regulators in cytokine
signaling, are known to be involved in
regulation of TLR-mediated immune
responses,10 and SOCS1, a negative regula-
tor of the JAK/STAT pathway, is induced
by HCV core protein.9,11,12 In addition, T
cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3
(Tim-3), a key inhibitory receptor, is
expressed on eosinophils, T lymphocytes,
dendritic cells, macrophages and lymphoid
cells,13 and is overexpressed on T cells in
patients with HCV infection or HCV/HIV
coinfection.14­17 It has been suggested that
Tim-3, which is constitutively expressed by
cells of the innate immune system, may
synergize with the TLR system to influ-
ence a range of inflammatory conditions
by promoting or terminating cell immun-
ity.13 Tim-3 may therefore serve opposing
roles, and induce distinct signaling in
innate and adaptive immune cells.18 The
interaction between Tim-3 and its ligand,
Galectin-9 (Gal-9), can inhibit the T cell
response and induce apoptosis,19­22 sug-
gesting that the Tim-3/Gal-9 pathway may
be adopted to escape immune surveillance
during chronic viral infection. Blockade of
the Tim-3/Gal-9 pathway might help to
reinvigorate antiviral immunity and
thereby improving the clinical efficacy of
current immunotherapies.
Both innate and adaptive immunity have
a profound impact on status of HCV infec-
tion, and impairment of host immunity may
lead to chronic infection.23,24 We have pre-
viously shown that TLR3-expressing
CD14þ monocyte levels are correlated
with treatment response in patients with
HCV infection.7 The aim of the present
study was to evaluate the role of Tim-3/Gal-
9 signaling in chronic HCV infection, and
virological response in patients with chronic
HCV infection treated with IFN-based
therapies. In addition, we aimed to clarify
whether TLR3/TLR4 activation and Tim-3
inhibition could induce production of anti-
viral molecules in human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which might be
beneficial for HCV clearance.

Patients and methods
Study population
Patients aged 18 to 65 years with chronic
HCV infection were recruited from Third
Hospital of Hebei Medical University, the
Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang City and
Bethune International Peace Hospital
(Shijiazhuang, China) between December
2011 and November 2012, with follow-up
concluded in May 2014. Diagnosis were
made using European Association for the
Study of the Liver (EASL) Clinical Practice
Guidelines: Management of hepatitis
C virus infection25 and the diagnostic cri-
teria of The Guidelines for Prevention and
Treatment of Hepatitis C issued by the
Chinese Society of Hepatology and
Chinese Society of Infectious Diseases and
Parasitology of Chinese Medical
Association.26 Exclusion criteria were: pres-
ence of decompensated cirrhosis; coinfection
with HIV, hepatitis A, B or D virus; other
causes of chronic liver disease; or comorbid-
ities precluding interferon therapy. A group
of age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers
who were attending regular health screening
and were free from HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV
and any other cause of chronic liver disease
were recruited as the control group.
The study protocol conformed to the
guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of
Helsinki and was approved by the ethics
committee of Third Hospital of Hebei
Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.
All study participants provided written
informed consent. All ongoing and related
trials for this drug/intervention are regis-
tered (ChiCTR-TNRC-10001090).
Blood sampling
Peripheral blood (5 ml) was collected
into sterile tubes containing 10.8 mg potas-
sium­EDTA from all participants at
baseline, and from patients at treatment
week 12 and 24 weeks post-treatment.
Blood was initially centrifuged at 1200 Â g
for 10 min at room temperature, then the
supernatant was transferred into a new
microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at
12 000 Â g for 15 min at 4C to remove
cellular debris. The resulting plasma was
stored at À80C until further use.
HCV detection
Plasma HCV antibodies were detected using a
commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent
assay(ELISA) kit(Anti-HCVRapidTestKit,
Livzon diagnostics INC, Zhuhai, China).
Plasma HCV RNA was quantified using a
qualitative reverse transcriptase polymerase
chainreaction(RT­PCR)kit (CobasTaqman
HCV Test, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
IN, USA; lowest limit of detection 15IU/ml)
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
HCV genotypes were identified using an HCV
genotyping oligochip (Tianjin Third Central
Hospital, China).27
Biochemical assays
Blood (3 ml) was collecting from participants
afteranovernightfast,centrifugedat1200Â g
for 30min and immediately divided into ali-
quots. Serum was then frozen and stored at
À80C until use. Serum alanine aminotrans-
ferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) were quantified using an Olympus
AU5400 automatic chemical analyser.
Treatment
Patients with chronic hepatitis C were treated
with pegylated IFNa-2a (PegIFNa-2a; 135mg/
week for body weight < 60kg and 180mg/
week for body weight ! 60kg, subcutane-
ously; Pegasys, Roche, Basel, Switzerland)
plus weight-based RBV (13­15 mg/kg per
day; Zhejiang Chengyi Pharmaceutical Co.,
Ltd, Zhejiang, China). Treatment continued
808 Journal of International Medical Research 44(4)
for 44 weeks after HCV RNA was undetect-
able. Standard definitions of responses were
used. Complete early virological response
(cEVR) was defined as undetectable plasma
HCV RNA at week 12 during therapy, and
sustained virological response (SVR) was
defined as undetectable HCV RNA at 24
weeks after planned end of treatment.
PBMC culture
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were isolated from heparinized
peripheral blood (15 ml) from 15 patients
and 15 healthy control subjects using Ficoll
density gradient centrifugation (Hanyang
Biologicals Technology, Tianjin, China).
PBMCs were plated in duplicate at
1.0 Â 106 cells/well in 24-well plates and
divided into five groups: control (untreated);
TLR4 agonist group (1mg/ml lipopolysac-
charide [LPS]); Tim-3 antagonist þ TLR4
agonist group (10mg/ml anti-Tim-3 antibody
[Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA] for
30 min, supplemented with 1mg/ml LPS);
TLR3 agonist group (20mg/ml polyinosi-
nic­polycytidylic acid, [Poly(I:C)]) group;
Tim-3 antagonist þ TLR3 agonist group
(10mg/ml anti-Tim-3 antibody for 30 min,
supplemented with 20mg/ml Poly[I:C]). All
cells were incubated at 37C with 5% carbon
dioxide for 24 h in serum free medium
(Botna Biological Technology, Beijing,
China) containing 100mg/ml penicillin­
streptomycin (North China Pharmaceutical
Group Corporation, Hebei, China) and
300mg/ml L-glutamine (Bio-high
Technology, Hebei, China). The super-
natant was removed and used for cytokine
assays, and the remaining PBMCs were used
for RT­PCR for 20-50OAS, myxovirus
resistance protein A (MxA) and SOCS1.
Cytokine assays
Plasma Gal-9 was quantified at baseline (all
participants), and treatment week 12 and 24
weeks post-treatment (patients)(Human
Galectin 9 ELISA kit, R&D Systems Inc.
Minneapolis, MN, USA). Concentrations of
IFN-a and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)
in supernatants from PBMC culture were
determined using ELISA kits (Human IFN-
a and TNF-a ELISA kits, R&D Systems
Inc.) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Limits of detection were
0.3 pg/ml for Gal-9, 15 pg/ml for IFN-a
and 8 pg/ml for TNF-a. The plates were
read on a microplate reader (ELX800; Bio-
Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT).
qRT­PCR
Total RNA was isolated from PBMCs using
TRIzolÕ (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China),
according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions. The mRNA concentrations of 20-
50OAS, MxA and SOCS1 were determined
by qRT­PCR using an ABI PRISM 7500
sequence detection system (Applied
Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA) with SYBR
Green Reagent (Tiangen Biotech).
Expression levels of the target genes were
normalized against the endogenous refer-
ence gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Primer
sequences (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai,
China) are listed in Table 1. All data were
obtained using Sequence Detector Software
(Applied Biosystems).
Statistical analyses
Sample size estimation was determined by
PASS software (NCSS Statistical Software,
Kaysville, UT, USA) based on references
and prelimitary experiments. To detect a
minimal 71.16 difference in plasma Gal-9
levels (between healthy controls and
patients) with a ¼ 0.05, two-tailed and a
power of 80%, 11 patients per group were
required (n ¼ 22 in total). To increase the
reliability of the results, 52 patients
were recruited. Sample size analysis for
Nan et al. 809
IFN-a, 20-50OAS, MxA, TNF-a and SOCS1
quantification indicated 15 subjects were
required per group for this part of the study.
Data were expressed as mean Æ SD or
median (range). Statistical analyses were
performed with independent t-test, one-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or
Kruskal­Wallis H test, with the least signifi-
cant difference-t (LSD-t) test or Mann­
Whitney U-test for post-hoc comparison.
The 2-test was used to compare categorical
data. Correlations between variables were
calculated using Spearman rank order cor-
relations. All P-values were two-tailed, and
were considered significant when < 0.05.
Data were analysed using SPSSÕ version
16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ.
Results
The study included 52 patients (22 males/30
females; mean age 45.1 Æ 13.8 years; age
range 18 ­ 65 years) and 20 control subjects
(9 males/11 females; mean age 44.9 Æ 11.7
years; age range 25 ­ 60 years).
Demographic and clinical characteristics of
the study population are given in Table 2.
Serum ALT and AST were significantly
higher in patients than in controls
(P ¼ 0.001 and P ¼ 0.01, respectively;
Table 1). There were no significant between
group differences in gender, age, or body
mass index. A flowchart indicating progres-
sion through the study is shown in Figure 1.
A total of three patients were lost to follow-
up at week 12 of treatment, and a total of ten
patients were lost to follow-up at 24 weeks
post-treatment. In total, 81.6% (40/49) of
patients achieved cEVR, and 73.8% (31/42)
achieved SVR. There were no statistically
significant between-group differences in any
baseline demographic or clinical character-
istic when patients were stratified according
to cEVR/non cEVR and SVR/non SVR
(Table 3).
Plasma Gal-9 levels were significantly
higher in patients than controls at each
time point (P < 0.01 for each comparison;
Figure 2(a)). In patients, Gal-9 levels were
significantly lower than baseline at treat-
ment week 12 and at 24 weeks post-treat-
ment (P < 0.01 for each comparison;
Figure 2(a)). Plasma Gal-9 levels were sig-
nificantly lower in patients who achieved
cEVR than those who did not, at baseline,
treatment week 12, and 24 weeks post-
treatment (P < 0.05 for each comparison;
Figure 2(b)). Similarly, Plasma Gal-9 levels
at each time point were significantly lower in
patients who achieved SVR than those who
did not (P < 0.05 for each comparison;
Figure 2(c)). There was no correlation
between plasma Gal-9 level and baseline
HCV load (data not shown). Regression
analysis showed that there was no

Data regarding levels of IFN-a, TNF-a,
and 20-50OAS, MxA and SOCS1 RNA in
PBMC cultures are shown in Table 4.
Treatment with TLR3 or TLR4 agonists
alone and in combination with Tim-3 antag-
onist significantly upregulated IFN-a, 20-
50OAS RNA and MxA RNA compared
with untreated control cells, in PBMCs
from both patients and healthy control sub-
jects (P < 0.05 for each comparison; Table 4).
IFNa levels were significantly lower in
patient-derived PBMCs treated with com-
bined TLR4 agonist and Tim-3 antagonist
compared with the same treatment in control
subject-derived cells (P < 0.05; Table 4).
Levels of 20-50OAS RNA were significantly
lower in patient-derived PBMCs treated with
combined TLR4 agonist and Tim-3 antag-
onist as well as combined TLR3 agonist and
Tim-3 antagonist compared with the same
treatments in control subject-derived cells
(P < 0.05 for each comparison; Table 4).
There were no significant differences between
patient-derived and control-derived cells in
levels of MxA RNA.
In both patient-derived and control-
derived cells, levels of IFN-a, 20-50OAS

antagonist significantly reversed the increase
in SOCS1 RNA in TLR3 treated cultures
(P < 0.05; Table 4) but not in TLR4 agonist
treated cultures. In both patient- and con-
trol-derived cells, the addition of Tim-3
antagonist had no effect on TNF-a levels
in TLR4 agonist treated cultures, but sig-
nificantly reversed the increase in TLR3
agonist treated cells (P < 0.05; Table 4).
In all treatment groups except Tim-3
antagonist/TLR3 combined treatment,
levels of SOCS1 RNA were significantly
higher in patient-derived cells compared
with control-derived cells (P < 0.05 for

significant differences between patient-
derived and control-derived cells in levels
of TNF-a.
Discussion
The initial aim of this study was to investi-
gate the dynamic changes in plasma
Gal-9 levels in patients with chronic HCV
infection undergoing PegIFNa-2/RBV
treatment. Plasma Gal-9 levels were signifi-
cantly elevated in patients with chronic
HCV infection compared with healthy con-
trol subjects in the present study, suggesting
that persistent high Gal-9 levels might con-
tribute to refractory chronic hepatitis C.
Antiviral treatment significantly reduced
plasma Gal-9 levels compared with baseline
in our patient cohort, particularly in those
patients who achieved cEVR or SVR. Gal-9
may play an important role in the immune
response.28 This indicated that the antiviral
therapies could down-regulate the expres-
sions of inhibitory molecule Gal-9 and
related to the restoration of immune mod-
ulatory activity of Tim-3/Gal-9 pathway,
which might improve outcomes of IFNa-
based therapy for HCV infection.
Our previous study demonstrated that
TLR3 expressing CD14 þ monocytes were
present in significantly lower numbers in
patients who achieved cEVR than those who
did not.4 TLR3 and TLR4 agonists have
been shown to have significant efficacy
against HCV,7 and both can induce antiviral
molecules such as 20-50OAS.9 In the present
study, TLR3 and TLR4 agonists increased
the levels of IFN-a, and 20-50OAS and MxA
RNAs. The combination of TLR3/TLR4
agonist and Tim-3 antagonist further
stimulated expression of these antiviral pro-
teins in the current study, with TLR3
agonist þ Tim-3 antagonist shown to have
the strongest inducer of anti-HCV mol-
ecules. These findings suggest that activation
of TLR3 alone or in combination with Tim-
3 suppression may produce an effective
antiviral response and represent a possible
approach for immune therapy in patients
with chronic HCV infection.
The induction of the proinflammatory
cytokine TNF-a was evaluated in the pre-
sent study in order to determine the poten-
tial side effects of the TLR agonists and
Tim-3 antagonist. TNF-a is a key proin-
flammatory cytokine, high levels of which
have been shown to aggravate liver injury
and result in a low response rate to IFN-a
based antiviral therapy in patients with
HCV infection.29 Blocking of Tim-3 on the
surface of monocytes has been shown to
inhibit TNF-a expression.30 Combination
treatment of PBMCs with TLR3/TLR4
agonist and Tim-3 antagonist significantly
reduced TNF-a levels compared with
TLR3/TLR4 agonist alone in the present
study. Interestingly, the addition of Tim-3
antagonist to TLR3 agonist treated cells
completely ameliorated the increase in TNF-
a levels seen with TLR3 agonist treatment
alone. These findings suggest that comodu-
lation of TLR3 and Tim-3 may provide a
treatment option for HCV infection, sup-
pressing inflammatory response while
enhancing antiviral activity.
The negative immune-regulator SOCS1
was upregulated by treatment with TLR3 or
TLR4 agonist in the present study. This may
be due to induction of type 1 IFN by TLR,

activating the JAK/STAT pathway and
inducing SOCS1 expression.11 It has been
reported that Tim-3 and SOCS1 communi-
cate with each other and co-ordinately
inhibit cell signalling transduction, resulting
in impaired innate immune response.12,20
Culture with a combination of TLR3 agon-
ist and Tim-3 antagonist did not induce
SOCS1 expression in the present study,
suggesting that blockade of Tim-3 could
suppress SOCS1 expression induced by TLR
The present study had several limitations.
In order to gain insight into the underlying
mechanism and therapeutic role of modula-
tion of TLRs and the Tim-3/Gal-9 pathway,
large-scale studies and further research are
required. In addition, T cells should be
isolated from PBMCs for in vitro experi-
ments, and the activation of effector T cell
subsets and expression of related cytokines
should be determined in patients with
chronic HCV infection.
In conclusion, plasma Gal-9 levels were
significantly upregulated in patients with
chronic HCV infection, and were signifi-
cantly reduced by antiviral treatment with
IFN-based therapy. Low plasma Gal-9
levels before, during, and after antiviral
therapy were crucial to achieve early and
sustained virological responses. Blockade of
Tim-3 in combination with TLR activation,
especially TLR3, induces the expression of
antiviral molecules without a significant
increase in the proinflammatory TNF-a or
the negative immune-regulator SOCS1, indi-
cating a possible therapeutic approach for
patients with chronic HCV infection.
