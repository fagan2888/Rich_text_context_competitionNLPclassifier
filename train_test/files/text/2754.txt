Objectives. Community processes are key determinants of older adults' ability to age in place, but existing scales measuring these
constructs may not provide accurate, unbiased measurements among older adults because they were designed with the concerns
of child-rearing respondents in mind. This study examines the properties of a new theory-based measure of collective efficacy
(CE) that accounts for the perspectives of older residents. Methods. Data come from the population-based Chicago Neighborhood
Organization, Aging and Health study (N = 1,151), which surveyed adults aged 65 to 95. Using descriptive statistics, correlations,
and factor analysis, we explored the acceptability, reliability, and validity of the new measure. Results. Principal component analysis
indicated that the new scale measures a single latent factor. It had good internal consistency reliability, was highly correlated
with the original scale, and was similarly associated with neighborhood exchange and disorder, self-rated health, mobility, and
loneliness. The new scale also showed less age-differentiated nonresponse compared to the original scale. Discussion. The older
adult CE scale has reliability and validity equivalent to that of the existing measure but benefits from a more developed theoretical
grounding and reduced likelihood of age-related differential nonresponse.
1. Introduction
Evidence suggests that community processes are important
to older adults' ability to age in place [1, 2]. Of the eight fac-
tors identified in the World Health Organization's report on
age-friendly cities [3], three seem fundamentally dependent
on community processes. These three, Age-Friendly Outdoor
Spaces (WHO factor 1), Social Participation (WHO factor 4),
and Respect and Social Inclusion (WHO factor 5) may all be
supported by structural innovations and resource infusion,
but, in all likelihood, cannot be sustained without on-
going community involvement. Community-level behavior
is important not only for the immediate results produced by
discrete actions and social exchange, but also for its role in
shaping the perceptions and norms of behavior held by the
community's residents.
The perceptions and norms of behavior likely relevant
to the three WHO factors fall under the rubric of a well-
developed sociological construct, collective efficacy. Collective
efficacy (CE) refers to perceptions and norms of two cate-
gories of social processes that represent two kinds of com-
munity social resources: trust and connection, commonly
referred to as social cohesion, and expectations for action,
commonly referred to as informal social control. Studies have
shown the importance of CE for multiple aspects of well-
being among older adults [4­7]. In particular, CE has been
shown to play a role in enhancing older adults' physical
health and neighborhood satisfaction, which may predict
their intentions to move and actual migration [2, 5, 8­14].
Unfortunately, existing scales measuring this construct may
not be ideal for use with older adults because they were
2 Journal of Aging Research
designed with the concerns of child-rearing respondents in
mind [15]. For example, scale items that ask about ex-
pectations of neighbor cooperation in monitoring children
may be less relevant to adults whose children are grown.
At the same time, the priorities of older adults are not
necessarily reflected in these existing scales.
At the individual level, a number of scales measuring
such constructs as anxiety and life satisfaction have been
developed based on theory and evidence regarding the
distinctiveness of older adults' experiences (e.g., [16­19]).
These and similar scales are able to measure the constructs
of interest among older adults more accurately and with
less response bias because they take into account the unique
concerns, challenges, and goals of adults in the later decades
of their lives [20]. For example, scales that feature items that
are more salient to older adults show increased instrument
acceptability in the form of higher response rates and lower
differential nonresponse [21]. Such scales, by providing
more easily recognized and comprehended items, also reduce
response burden [22]. By following the same principles,
scales measuring neighborhood social processes can be
designed such that they produce more accurate measurement
among older adults.
In this study we describe and test a new measure of
CE. This measure was developed specifically for use in
older populations, taking into account the unique ways that
people of their age and cohort interpret and respond to
common environmental cues, and the particular cues that we
hypothesized would be uniquely important to older adults.
In the first part of this paper, we explain the theoretical
framework guiding our identification of environmental cues
for CE likely to be salient to older adults. In the second part of
the paper, we test the new measure's instrument acceptability,
dimensionality, reliability, and criterion validity in an older
adult population. In the third part of the paper, we appraise
the new measure's construct validity by examining its
association with individual health-related outcomes. Our
aim was to construct a scale that can be used in research
on neighborhood social processes, the health of older adults,
and other factors that relate to aging in place.
Our theoretical framework combines CE theory with a
consideration of the particular challenges and opportunities
of the older adult life stage. As alluded to above, CE theory
attempts to explain the association between neighborhood
structural factors, social processes, and individual-level out-
comes by positing that the neighborhood processes of social
cohesion and informal social control mediate the relation-
ship between the structural factors and individual outcomes
[23, 24]. For example, compositional socioeconomic status
may impact social cohesion, which in turn affects self-rated
health, asthma rates, and inflammatory marker levels by
reducing stress and fear [4­7, 25]. CE is therefore likely
to be a part of the societal system that supports healthy
living, safeguards individuals against adverse health events,
and thereby enables aging in place [26]. CE is related to,
but distinct from, social network interaction and exchange
and social and physical disorder. The first is concerned with
norms and expectations, while the second and third refer to
actual behavior and conditions.
A range of theories from the aging and life course lit-
erature provide us with a framework for generating a set
of cues for social cohesion and informal social control that
would be particularly salient to older adults [27­33]. A key
focus of later life is to develop mechanisms to adapt to new
challenges, including frailty and morbidity and decreased
scope and density of social networks [30, 32, 34­37]. As
applied to the CE framework, these perspectives suggest
that perceptions of neighbors' willingness to assist older
adults with tasks, and perceptions of neighborhood norms
related to regulating behavior with the goal of enhancing
neighborhood safety and traversability, will be particularly
important. At the same time, older adults are not only
concerned with compensating for losses and coping with
challenges. Generativity is also a key component of later
life, defined as helping the next generation by, for instance,
passing on wisdom and thereby leaving a legacy [27­29].
Within the CE framework, this perspective incorporates the
notion that intergenerational exchange may contribute to a
prosocial orientation and a mutual respect for community
contributions across the life course.
In the remainder of this section, we discuss the research
literature underlying our selection of the four specific types
of cues for CE that we believe would be particularly salient
to older adults. The two types of social cohesion cues that we
hypothesize to be particularly salient to older adults, based
on theory in urban sociology and literature on aging, are
those that relate to active caretaking of vulnerable residents
and age integration/lack of ageism. The two types of informal
social control cues that we hypothesize to be particularly
salient to older adults, based on the theory and literature on
aging, are those that relate to minimizing social incivility and
maximizing accessibility.
Older adults may be particularly attuned to displays of
solidarity in the form of social cohesion cues related to active
caring and caretaking. Frailty and decreased mobility make
some tasks that are easy in middle age significantly more
difficult in later life [38, 39]. Simultaneously, many older
adults experience a decrease in the scope and density of their
social networks [40, 41]. As a result of this combination of
changes, older adults are often more reliant on assistance
from community members [42, 43]. Perceptions of the avail-
ability of neighbor assistance may be particularly important
to the well-being of older women compared to older men
and older single men compared to older married men, who
are unlikely and unable, respectively, to rely on their spouses
for help [44]. Older adults who believe that their neighbors
will provide active caretaking may be more confident about
their ability to stay in their homes. Our new measure of CE
includes two items designed to capture the tendency toward
active caretaking facet of the social cohesion construct.
Older adults may also be particularly attuned to, and able
to benefit substantially from, social cohesions cues related
to age integration and lack of ageism. Aging societies have
experienced an increase in social separation of age groups,
even as age heterogeneity within most neighborhoods has
increased [45­48]. One reason for the persistence of social
segregation by age despite decreased logistical barriers to
socializing across age boundaries may be ageism, which may
Journal of Aging Research 3
interfere with communication across agelines [49]. Another
factor impeding such communication is the decrease in
information processing speed and loss of hearing that com-
monly occurs at older ages [50­52]. These factors combine
to create a situation in which sustained effort is required for
cross-generational socializing.
Perceptions of opportunities for cross-generational inter-
actions are relevant to older adults priorities, and ability to
age in place, for a number of reasons. Communities in which
older and younger people associate may be communities in
which there are fewer age-based misunderstandings, biases,
fears, and resentments, and greater empathy on the part of
younger people for the challenges that come with later life
[45, 48, 49, 53]. Older adults who perceive their communities
as age integrated may therefore feel safer venturing outside to
participate in community life, because they would have less
reason to fear and more reason to feel connected to a wider
range of their neighbors. Expectations of communication
across age lines also encompass expectations for the ability to
potentially pass on wisdom, neighborhood history, or prac-
tical advice and thereby feel and be useful [54]. Such oppor-
tunities for generativity are likely to be crucial to neigh-
borhood satisfaction; being able to fill this social role has
been associated with lower mortality [55]. Our new meas-
ure of CE includes three items designed to capture the age
integration facet of the social cohesion construct.
Regarding the domain of informal social control, we
expect that older adults pay increased attention to the
community's expectations for behaviors that minimize social
incivility, as a result of reverse ageism (prejudice of older
people against younger people), the increase in frailty that
often accompanies advancing age [48, 56]. Older people with
impaired balance, reduced muscle strength, and limited gait
speed may be more likely than spry younger adults to find
the loud, unpredictable peregrinations of rowdy teenagers
threatening [48]. Furthermore, as a result of reverse ageism,
elderly residents may perceive even subdued teenagers as
a threat [56]. Their perceptions of the neighborhood's
expectations for protecting vulnerable residents from mali-
cious young people may be particularly important for older
residents' willingness to venture outside on a regular basis
and for their neighborhood satisfaction. Our new measure
of CE includes one item designed to capture the expectation
for actions that minimize social incivility, a component of the
informal social control construct.
Lastly, increased frailty and disability may also increase
the salience of cues for informal social control in the form
of expectations for behaviors that maximize accessibility. For
many older adults, navigating their neighborhoods becomes
more difficult as their mobility decreases and their vulnera-
bility for adverse health outcomes resulting from interactions
with environmental hazards increases [57­60]. Older frail
adults may be more attuned to obstacles and hazards in
the physical environment, particularly as those environments
become dilapidated [61]. Increased expectations for actions
aimed at improving the safety and integrity of the environ-
ment may be related to increased likelihood of maintaining
and using physical abilities and competencies for two
reasons: (1) it may be related to increased confidence about
venturing outside, and (2) it may relate to actual improved
conditions [8, 61, 62]. Maintenance of the environment can
in turn prevent the adverse health events that constitute
barriers to aging in place [13, 14, 26]. Our new measure of
CE includes two items designed to capture the expectations
for actions that maximize accessibility, a component of the
informal social control construct.
2. Methods
2.1. Data and Sample. We used data from the Chicago
Neighborhood, Organization, Aging and Health study
(NOAH). This study surveyed 1,500 adults aged 65 and over
living in 80 selected Chicago neighborhood clusters. Each
cluster was defined by two to three census tracts consisting
of approximately 4,000 housing units. The sample frame
consisted of all households in the city of Chicago containing
at least one member 65 years of age or older. The weighted
response rate for households with a phone number was
55.3% while the rate for those households for which a phone
number could not be identified was 12.4%. The overall
weighted response rate for the survey was 44.3%, a good rate
for a telephone interview by contemporary standards [63,
64]. Interviews were conducted over the phone in English
and Spanish between August 2006 and September 2007. The
NOAH study was approved by the institutional review boards
of both NORC and the Division of Biological Sciences at
the University of Chicago. All participants provided verbal
consent.
The sample consisted of the 76.7% of the 1,507 respon-
dents with complete demographic, health, and community
process data (N = 1, 151). Descriptive statistics are shown in
Table 1. The mean age was 73 (range 65­95), and 68% were
female. Over two fifths (44%) were non-Hispanic White,
over a third were Non-Hispanic Black (35.8%), and the rest
were Hispanic (14.9%) or Other (5%). About a third (32.6%)
were married, and about a tenth (9.8%) lived with someone
under the age of 18. About a quarter had less than 12 years of
education, about another quarter had graduated from high
school, and a little under half had some college or more.
A little more than a tenth of the sample had lived in their
neighborhood for less than 10 years, while a little less than
three quarters had lived in their neighborhood for more than
20 years. Those missing data, who were therefore excluded
from the sample as described above, were more likely to
be White Non-Hispanic than to be any other race/ethnicity
combination.
2.2. Measures of CE. The CE questions were presented to the
respondent in two blocks. The first block was introduced
with the sentences, "Now I'm going to read some statements
about things that people in your neighborhood may or may
not do. For each of these statements, please tell me whether
you strongly agree, somewhat agree, somewhat disagree, or
strongly disagree." The second block was introduced with the
sentence, "For each of the following, please tell me if it is very
likely, somewhat likely, somewhat unlikely, or very unlikely
that people in your neighborhood would act in the following
manner."

2.2.1. Collective Efficacy--Original Scale Items. The original
CE scale, composed of eight items, first appeared in the
Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods
[65]. In the NOAH survey, the items were administered
alongside the new CE items. The following three items were
in the first block: this is a close knit neighborhood; people
around here are willing to help their neighbors; people in
this neighborhood can be trusted. The next five items were in
the second block: your neighbors would break up a fight in
front of your house in which someone was being threatened
or beaten; your neighbors would do something about it if a
group of neighborhood children were skipping school and
hanging out on a street corner; your neighbors would do
something about it if some children were spray-painting
graffiti on a local building; neighborhood residents would
organize to try to do something to keep the fire station open
if because of budget cuts the fire station closest to your
home was going to be closed down by the city; people in
your neighborhood would scold a child who was showing
disrespect to an adult.
2.2.2. Collective Efficacy--New Scale Items. The new CE
scale, composed of eight items, was created by two of the
authors. The age integration facet of social cohesion was
measured with three items in the first block: people in your
neighborhood treat older people in this neighborhood with
respect; younger adults and children generally know who
the older people in the neighborhood are; older people in
this neighborhood socialize with younger adults as well as
people their own age. The answer options for each of these
were strongly agree, somewhat agree, somewhat disagree,
and strongly disagree. The active caretaking facet of social
cohesion was measured with two items, one in each block:
your neighbors would shop for groceries for you, if you were
sick; people in your neighborhood would check on older
or more vulnerable residents if there was a heat wave. The
answer options for the first item were the same as those
for the age integration items. The answer options for the
second item were very likely, somewhat likely, somewhat
unlikely, and very unlikely. The maximizing accessibility
facet of informal social control was measured with two
items in the second block: people in your neighborhood
would help to keep the sidewalks and other public spaces
clear if there was a snowstorm; people in the neighborhood
would help to get the problem corrected, if there was a
problem in the neighborhood that affected older adults, like
crumbling sidewalks or unsafe parks. The answer options
for both items ranged from very likely to very unlikely.
The minimizing social incivility facet of informal social
control was measured with a single item in the second block:
neighborhood residents would intervene if an older person
in your neighborhood was being threatened by a group of
teenagers. The answer options for this item again ranged
from very likely to very unlikely.
2.3. Demographic and Health Measures. Sociodemographic
measures included age, race/ethnicity, and marital status. An
indicator for the presence of a child under the age of 18 in
the household of the respondent was constructed using the
list generated by a household roster. Health was measured
using a self-report measure that asked: overall, how would
you rate your health in the past 4 weeks: excellent, very good,
good, fair, poor, or very poor? We treated self-rated health as
an ordinal categorical variable, collapsing the categories poor
and very poor into one, because less than 2% of the sample
answered "very poor". A measure of mobility was constructed
using two measures taken from the Health and Retirement
Survey (2002) and two measures adapted from the California
Health and Interview Survey (CHIS). The resulting ordinal
variable had the following categories: has difficulty walking
across a room, has difficulty walking one block, walks less
than 10 minutes or more each week, walks 10 minutes or
more once or a few times each week, walks 10 minutes or
more daily, walks 10 minutes or more multiple times a day.
Loneliness was measured using Hughes et al. [66] three-item
scale. It has a range of 0 to 3 and a mean of 1.4.
2.4. Neighborhood Process Measures. Besides CE, NOAH
measured two other neighborhood processes. Neighborhood
disorder was measured with a four-item scale from the
PHDCN and was introduced with the sentence, "I'm going
to read a list of things that are problems in some neigh-
borhoods. For each, please tell me how much of a problem
it is in your neighborhood--a big problem, somewhat of a
problem, or not a problem." The four items asked about litter,
graffiti, drug use and sale, and public drinking. The scale was
Journal of Aging Research 5
reliable in this sample (Cronbach's alpha = 0.74) and had a
range of 1 to 3, with a mean of 1.54. Neighborhood exchange
was measured with a four-item scale from the PHDCN and
was introduced with the sentence, "Now I am going to
ask about some things you might do with people in your
neighborhood. For each, please tell me if it happens often,
sometimes, rarely or never." The four items asked about
doing favors, watching over homes of absent neighbors,
asking for advice, and visiting. The scale was reliable in this
sample (Cronbach's alpha = 0.75) and had a range of 1 to 4,
with a mean of 2.8.
2.5. Analysis. In the first section of the analysis, the prop-
erties of the new CE scale were examined. Instrument ac-
ceptability and item salience were examined by comparing
response rates and differential nonresponse for each item
in the original and new CE scales. Next, the new scale
was examined for dimensionality using principal component
analysis. Because only one factor was identified, the next step
was to estimate internal consistency reliability by calculating
Cronbach's alpha for the new scale. Criterion validity of the
new scale was tested by calculating correlations with the
original CE scale. Convergent validity of the new scale was
tested by calculating the correlations of the new CE scale with
other NOAH measures of neighborhood processes.
In the second section of the analysis, the construct
validity of the new CE scale was tested in a two-step process.
First, we examined the correlations between the new scale
and the health, mobility and loneliness measures, comparing
the results to those from identical analyses using the original
CE scale. Second, we examined whether the new scale can
predict well-being more accurately in certain demographic
subgroups by comparing the fit statistics of regressions
estimated in those subgroups.
3. Results
3.1. New Collective Efficacy Scale: Instrument Acceptability.
We first examined percentage missing for each of the items
in the original and new CE scales. The items most likely
to be missing in the original CE scale were "do something
about kids skipping school" (4.4%) and "scold child for
showing adult disrespect" (3.7%). The items most likely to
be missing in the new CE scale were "younger people know
older people" (5%) and "older people socialize with younger
adults" (4.6%). The percentage missing one or more item
from the original CE scale was 10.9%, while the percentage
missing one or more item from the new CE scale was 13.0%.
No clear pattern emerged of one scale showing more missing
than the other.
3.2. New Collective Efficacy Scale: Differential Nonresponse.
The results of the differential nonresponse analysis are shown
in Table 2. Consistent with previous research, respondents in
the middle and oldest age categories were more likely than
those in the youngest age category to be missing at least
one item from both the original and older adult CE scales
[22]. The extent of this differential nonresponse by age was
not equal between scales, however. Those in the oldest age
category were more likely to be missing five of the eight items
in the old CE scale: the trustworthy neighbors item (7.9%
versus 1.4%, P < 0.01), the scold a disrespectful child item
(9.4% versus 2.4%, P < 0.01), the graffiti item (7.1% versus
1.7%, P < 0.05), the skipping school item (9.4% versus 3.1%,
P < 0.05), and the break up a fight item (4.7% versus 0.7%,
P < 0.05). In comparison, those in the oldest age category
were only more likely to be missing three of the eight items in
the new CE scale: the young people know older people item
(11.0% versus 3.7%, P < 0.05), the older people socialize
with young adults item (9.4% versus 3.7%, P < 0.05), and the
neighbors intervene to protect threatened elder item (6.3%
versus 1.7%, P < 0.05). Those in the middle age category
did not differ from those in the youngest age category in
their likelihood of missing any of the items in the new scale
but did differ in their likelihood of missing one item in
the original scale: the scold a disrespectful child item (4.9%
versus 2.4%, P < 0.05). Because such a small percentage of
the respondents were in the oldest age category (9%), we
recalculated these percentages comparing the youngest old
to the two older groups combined. In this case, those in
the middle and oldest age categories were more likely to be
missing four of the items from the original scale, but were
only more likely to be missing two of the items from the
new scale. In the old scale, these items were the trustworthy
neighbors item (4.2% versus 1.4%, P < 0.01), the fire station
item (3.7% versus 1.8%), the scold a disrespectful child item
(5.8% versus 2.3%, P < 0.01), and the do something about
a child skipping school item (6.3% versus 3.1%, P < 0.01).
In the new scale, these items were the young people know
older people item (7.0% versus 3.7%, P < 0.01) and the older
people socialize with young adults item (6.0% versus 3.7%,
P < 0.05).
3.3. New Collective Efficacy Scale: Dimensionality, Reliability,
Criterion and Convergent Validity. The results from the
principal component analysis suggested that the eight items
in the new CE scale represented a single latent factor, since
only one component had an eigenvalue greater than one. The
internal consistency reliability of the scale, as measured by
Cronbach's alpha, was 0.81. It was slightly higher for those
over 77 and men (0.82 for both groups) and slightly lower for
those 65­69 and women (0.79 and 0.80, resp.). The internal
consistency reliability of the theoretically defined subscales
was 0.65 (informal social control) and 0.72 (social cohesion).
To examine the criterion validity of the new scale,
we calculated its correlation with the old CE scale. The
correlation of the scales with each other was 0.81, the
correlation of the theoretically defined old and new social
cohesion subscales was 0.68, and the correlation of the
theoretically defined old and new informal social control
subscales was 0.72.
We next tested for convergent and divergent validity by
examining the association of the new CE scale with the
two other NOAH measures of neighborhood quality, neigh-
borhood disorder and neighborhood exchange (Table 3).
Neighborhood exchange was more highly correlated with
the new CE scale than it was with the original scale,

while neighborhood disorder was more highly (negatively)
correlated with the original CE scale than the new CE scale.
Also, disorder was more highly (negatively) correlated with
the new theoretically defined CE subscale of informal control
than with the new theoretically defined CE subscale of social
cohesion, while the reverse was true for exchange.
3.4. New Collective Efficacy Scale: Construct Validity. In the
second part of the analysis, we examined the construct
validity of the new scale by comparing its correlation with
various health measures with similar correlations between
the original scale and those measures. The correlations
between the original and the new CE scales and the self-
rated health, mobility, and loneliness measures are shown in
Table 4. The correlation between self-rated health and CE,
whether measured with the original or the new scale, was
-0.17 (P < 0.0001). The correlation between mobility and
CE, whether measured with the original or the new scale, was
0.07 (P < 0.05). The correlations between loneliness and the
original and new CE scales differed. The correlation with the
original scale was -0.16 (P < 0.0001) while the correlation
with the new scale was -0.20 (P < 0.0001).
Lastly, we regressed each of these three measures on
the two CE measures one at a time and compared the fit
statistics. The fit of the models, as measured by the r-
squared statistic, was not better for one scale than for the

these models estimated for the male and female subsamples,
the married and unmarried subsamples, each of the age
subgroups, and the sub-samples with and without children
in their households (not shown). There were no differences
in fit.
4. Discussion
The aim of this paper was to describe the development
and examine the properties of a new theory-based measure
of CE that incorporates the perspectives of older residents.
One motivation for creating a new scale customized for a
particular subpopulation is that the increased instrument
acceptability and salience of the customized items may
increase the response rate for the scale items. The results from
our examination of the percentage missing the individual
items, as well as percentage missing one or more items from
the old versus the new CE scales, did not show such effects.
Neither at the individual item level, nor at the scale level, did
it appear that one scale is less or more likely to have missing
values.
However, another motivation for creating a new scale
customized for a particular subpopulation is that the
increased salience of the customized items may decrease
or eliminate differential nonresponse by the variables that
define the subpopulation. The results from our analysis
suggest such an effect in our new CE scale. The likelihood

of missing was greater among the oldest old than the rest of
the sample for five of the eight items in the original scale,
but only three of the eight items in the new scale. The new
scale is therefore better suited for use in older populations,
because nonresponse will be less likely to be a function
of age. This pattern was also in line with our hypothesis
that items related to children would be less relevant and
therefore harder to answer for older adults. Of the items with
differential nonresponse, three of the five from the original
scale and one of the three from the new older adult scale
concerned young people.
The results of our dimensionality and reliability analysis
suggest that the scale measures one factor, with good re-
liability. It has reasonable criterion validity, in that it was
closely correlated with the original CE scale and the other two
neighborhood scales, neighborhood exchange and disorder.
It was perhaps to be expected that neighborhood exchange
would be more highly correlated with the new CE scale than
with the original scale, while neighborhood disorder would
be more highly (negatively) correlated with the original CE
scale than with the new CE scale, since the original CE scale
has an equal number of social cohesion and informal social
control items, while the new CE scale has 5 social cohesion
items but only 3 informal social control items. This difference
in the number of items measuring each part of CE may also
explain why disorder was more highly (negatively) correlated
with the new theoretically defined CE subscale of informal
control than with the new theoretically defined CE subscale
of social cohesion, while the reverse was true for exchange.
The results of the construct validity analysis suggest that
the new CE scale predicts health and mobility just as well as
does the original CE scale and may predict loneliness slightly
better--an important finding given recent literature on the
prevalence and salience of loneliness among older adults.
4.1. Limitations. The primary limitation of this study is
its geographic specificity. Because it is limited to a single
city, replication studies will need to examine the measure's
psychometric properties in rural and suburban contexts,
as well as in other urban areas. The other limitations of
this study relate to its survey modality. Phone surveys are
subject to sampling and response bias, the first exacerbated
by increased use of call screening technology and the rapid
growth of telephone marketing [64, 67]. However, the risk
of social desirability bias inherent in the telephone survey
administration modality should be relatively minor given the
non-personal and therefore non-sensitive nature of most of
the questions asked [68, 69]. Also, sampling or response bias
due to hearing impairment is likely to be less significant than
such bias due to vision and fine motor impairment in studies
using self-administered questionnaires [22, 70].
5. Conclusions
The importance of neighborhood context, and in particular
its potential ability to modify adverse health event risk,
prevalence, and severity is being increasingly recognized.
For example, the original measure of CE has just recently
been added to the PhenX toolkit, a set of consensus
measures intended to standardize genetic and epidemio-
logical research (http://www.phenxtoolkit.org/-February 4
2011, Version 4.2). While the benefits to using standard
measures include comparability across studies and the
potential to easily combine results in meta-analyses, there
are also benefits to using measures customized to particular
populations. The new measure of CE presented in this study
has reliability and validity equivalent to that of the existing
measure but benefits from a stronger gerontology-related
theoretical grounding and reduced likelihood of age-related
differential nonresponse.
The two measures exhibited both high correlation and
comparable effects on the health outcomes considered. These
findings raise the larger question of the extent to which
measures of distinct forms of CE are capturing an underlying
latent neighborhood capacity.
CE theory underscores the goal-directed nature of mobi-
lization capacity, suggesting that a given neighborhood may
have differing levels of CE depending upon the specific
challenge under consideration. In this view, communities
with high levels of CE with respect to the social control of
public space may or may not share a comparable willingness
to maintain and promote the health and well-being of local
older adults.
Yet, in practice, evidence suggests that high levels of CE
across multiple objectives are likely to cluster together in the
same communities. This may be due to the shared origins
of distinct forms of CE in the structural (e.g., economic
advantage, residential stability) and social (e.g., informal
8 Journal of Aging Research
network density, voluntary organization participation) con-
ditions of urban neighborhoods. Cohesive neighborhoods
with high levels of mutual trust and solidarity may provide
the conditions under which generalized prosocial norms
emerge, benefiting a broad base of residential constituencies.
Although the current analysis offers evidence consistent
with the notion of a generalized collective capacity, we do
not view these results as grounds upon which we reject the
hypothesis that CE exhibits distinct dimensions. First, CE
with respect to the social control of public space may have
indirect benefits for older adults. Fear and the associated
withdrawal from neighborhood environments may have
important health implications for older adults and may be
strongly related to local norms regarding the social control
of children (a significant component of the original CE
scale). Thus it may be the case that the original CE operates,
in part, indirectly to produce comparable associations with
the health outcomes considered. Second, research on the
dynamics of neighborhood collective capacities is incipient.
Analyses of the association and impact of CE measures
focused on other shared goals (e.g., expectations regarding
influence of local institutions) may reveal different patterns,
warranting more extensive research.
In the case of older adult's perceptions of their commu-
nities' association with the factors that predict whether and
how older adults age in place, the strength and mechanisms
are still not fully understood. For example, it may be that
even before health deteriorates, specific expectations that
neighbors will provide help when needed and will take steps
to maintain the safety of the common areas are the particular
perceptions that predict intentions to stay. Similarly, it may
be that when health and functionality deteriorate, the specific
perception that neighbors are assuming the caretaking
role usually shouldered by family may be the particular
perception that forestalls a move. This new measure of CE
can be used to test these hypothesized pathways, as well as
the others discussed in the introduction (Section 1), that may
link CE to neighborhood satisfaction, health, and the other
factors that predict intention to move and actual migration.
