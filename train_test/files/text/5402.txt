Finding That College Students Cluster
in Majors Based on Differing Patterns
of Spatial Visualization and Language
Processing Speeds
Richard M. Oldrieve1 and Cynthia Bertelsen2
Abstract
For over 30 years, researchers such as Eisenberg and McGinty have investigated the relationship between 3-D visualization
skills and choice of college major. Results of the present study support the fact that science and math majors tend to do
well on a measure of 3-D visualization. Going beyond these earlier studies, the present study investigated whether a
measure of Rapid Automatic Naming of Objects--which is normally used to screen for elementary school students who
might struggle with speech, language, literacy, and numeracy--would further differentiate the choice of majors by college
students. Far more research needs to be conducted, but results indicated that college students differentially clustered in
scatterplot quadrants defined by the two screening assessments. Furthermore, several of these clusters, plus a statistical
multiplier, may lead to a new understanding of students with phonological processing differences, learning disabilities, and
speech and language impairments.

This article describes a study with three levels of focus. The
first level was confirmatory. Since at least Eisenberg and
McGinty's study was published in 1977, it has been known
that college students majoring in science and math tend to
have better visualization skills than students enrolled in
math courses for other majors, such as elementary
education. Furthermore, as has been shown by Medina,
Gerson, and Sorby (1998), there seems to be a minimum
level of visualization skill necessary for college students to
succeed in majors such as science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics (STEM). More recently, researchers have
found visualization is useful to perform some STEM-related
tasks outside the classroom (Lathan & Tracey, 2002;
Menchaca-Brandan, Liu, Oman, & Natapoff, 2007; Piburn
et al., 2005). In addition, researchers have begun to
demonstrate visualization can be improved in ways that
help students succeed in college. For example, Sorby
(2000) and Boersma, Hamlin, and Sorby (2004) enrolled
college engineering students with low visualization skills
into mini-courses designed to improve their visualization
skills. These studies found that the mini-courses not only
improved the student's visualization skills, but they raised
the student's grade point averages (GPAs) and a higher
percentage of them graduated with an engineering degree.
Similarly, Onyancha and Kinsey (2007) have shown
engineering courses can be designed to improve
visualization.
Thus, to set a baseline for future implementation of
visualization courses, the research question for the
confirmatory level of focus was, "Do college students
enrolled in a calculus class for math and science majors
have higher levels of visualization ability than Early
Childhood majors enrolled in a literacy assessment
course?"
The second level of focus was to determine if there were
other majors where visualization could be predicted to be
necessary. For example, students were tested in three fine
arts courses: Music Theory, Printmaking, and the
Foundations of 3-Dimensional Art. The study also
expanded beyond elementary education majors to several
other education majors where it could be expected
visualization may or may not be required. For example, this
study's participants included future K-3 early childhood
teachers, Grades 4 to 8 middle childhood teachers, and high
school science, math, language arts, and social studies
teachers.
The research question for this second level of focus was,
"Do students enrolled in college classes that seem to present
prima facie evidence of requiring visualization have higher
scores on a test of visualization than students enrolled in

classes and majors where visualization does not seem to be
required?
The third level of focus was exploratory. Researchers in
the field of learning disabilities have long believed that with
proper early intervention, students with learning disabilities
who are given appropriate early interventions might
succeed in certain fields. Corina et al. (2001) referenced the
Aesop Fable to suggest that proper early intervention can
help the methodical tortoise outrace the hare. A metaphor
that is based on a tortoise seems appropriate to this study
because slow times on assessment of rapid automatic
naming (RAN) have long been correlated with the
phonological processing disorders manifested in many
students with speech and language impairments and
learning disabilities. For example, in their meta-analysis,
the National Early Literacy Panel (2008) found that
measures of RAN of Objects have a moderate correlation
with early reading failure (Objects r = .32 and
Letters/Digits r = .40).
Unfortunately, Aesop's fable version of the tortoise
metaphor relies on the hare being lazy. A better tortoise
metaphor might be built around E. O. Wilson's (1999,
1978/2004) interpretation of evolutionary niches as well as
Charles Darwin's studies of the ecology of the Galapagos
Islands. In terms of evolutionary biology, a tortoise trades
off the advantage of carrying around a defensive shell for
the disadvantage of slow mobility. Thus, the tortoise does
not have to "catch" the hare to thrive; the tortoise merely
has to live in an ecological niche where a defensive shell is
a bigger advantage than possessing blazing speed.
The fact that RAN speed can differ depending on the
task is supported by MacLeod (1991) theory of parallel
processing. He suggested that differences in the quantity of
parallel processors would explain differences in how long
individuals take to complete a RAN task that has cognitive
interference (i.e., Stroop effects). For example, it is much
easier to name a series of objects when a word printed on
top of the object is the same as the name of the object than
when the printed word is different from the name of the
object. Similarly, if the object is a line-drawing of a boat,
then naming the object as being a "boat" is easier to do if
the word "boat" is printed on top of a pictured boat than it
would be to do if the printed word is "car." Similarly, if the
word "red" is printed in purple ink, it takes longer to name
the ink as being purple than it is to name the printed word
as being "red."
When interpreting the results of an earlier study on a
phonemic awareness intervention, Oldrieve (2005, 2007a,
2007b) used MacLeod (1991) theory to hypothesize that
students with slow times on RAN would tend to devote
more parallel processors to a given task than students with
fast times. And that in early elementary school, this
tendency makes it harder for them to make appropriate
paired associations--for example, a beginning reader
learning to
· Identify that a specific letter sound is represented by a
given written letter;
· Identify that a given letter makes a specific sound;
· During spelling, match spoken phonemes to written
graphemes; and
· During reading, decode written words into spoken
words.
Yet, with more complex comprehension and problem-
solving tasks--like those found in upper level college
courses--the Oldrieve hypothesized that a student who tends
to devote more parallel processors to a given task would have
an advantage. Thus, Oldrieve hypothesized that students who
name objects more slowly than their peers in elementary
school, and who succeed in learning how to read, write, and
do arithmetic (with or without having been officially
diagnosed with a phonological processing disorder), and who
succeed in getting accepted into college, may do well in
college courses where complex comprehension and/or
problem solving is required.
Admittedly, this is a correlational study instead of a
longitudinal study. Therefore, it cannot causally show that
the students who manifested slow rapid automatic times
when they were tested for this study would have manifested
slow times in elementary school. Therefore, the two third-
level research questions are as follows:
· What college majors would college students with
slow RAN of Object times tend to be found?
· Would there be any interaction effects between RAN
of Objects times and Purdue Spatial Visualization
Test: Rotations (PSVT:R) percentages that could be
found on scatterplots?
Method
Multi-level Research Team
Just as this study has three levels of research questions, this
study was conducted with the help of a three-level research
team. At the top level, the overall funding grant for this
study came from a consortium of four universities, an open
enrollment community college that serves as a feeder
school to the universities, and dozens of K-12 schools. The
mission of COSMOS: the Northwest Ohio Center for
Excellence in STEM Education is to improve math and
science education for kindergarten to doctoral-level
students.
The second level originated within a teaching and
learning community sponsored by one of the participating
universities. This teaching and learning community focuses
on improving science and math education at the university
where it is held. Members include professors and graduate
students who teach college students algebra, biology,
calculus, chemistry, environmental health, geology,
physics, psychology, statistics, math education, science

education, and literacy assessment. To fund the present
study, six members of the teaching and learning community
helped write a grant from the overarching consortium. They
also helped collect the data within their math and science
classes. They also recruited a member of the overarching
consortium to collect data at her community college.
It was Oldrieve who convinced the other members of the
teaching and learning community's research team to include
Wiig, Semel, and Nystrom's (1982) assessment of RAN of
Objects. Furthermore, Oldrieve recruited the fine arts and
literacy assessment professors to grant us 30 min of class
time to assess their students.
In addition, Oldrieve recruited Bertelsen, a fellow
literacy professor, to supervise the "blind" data handling,
and to help write and edit conference proposals, conference
presentations, and this article. Graduate students in the
literacy program were then recruited by the literacy
professors to proctor the assessments in the literacy
assessment and fine arts classes. The graduate students then
helped collect, collate, and input the data into an excel
database. The complete team of Oldrieve, Bertelsen,
Darabie, Bullerjahn, Filippova, Bragg, Keil, & Meel (2008)
reported preliminary results at a conference sponsored by
the COSMOS consortium which funded the study.
After the excel database was created, it was analyzed by
(a) Oldrieve, who conducted the SPSS analysis and
formatted the scatterplots; (b) a statistics professor, Nancy
Boudreau, who made the suggestion of using fine arts
classes and who conducted an SAS analysis to check
Oldrieve's work; and (c) a doctoral student in statistics,
Ngoc Nguyen, who found the statistical multiplier. Then the
results were checked again by another statistics professor,
Mike Gillespie.
Next, several of the math and science professors
participated in a presentation of this study's overall results
at the consortium's annual symposium. The math and
science professors then used the data set to focus on the
visualization data to improve their own teaching and decide
whether to replicate the 10-week visualization course
developed by Sorby (2000) and her colleagues (Boersma et
al., 2004).
It is also important to note that both the overarching
consortium and the university's faculty research
organization have provided additional grants for developing
online administration of the assessments. In addition, as a
follow-up to this study, the organizers for the consortium's
last two annual symposiums allocated the two literacy
professors a conference room to conduct an all-day
participatory action research project, where symposium
attendees could stop in for 20 min to take the demographic
survey and two assessments on iPads.
Participants
The original study included a total of 356 students who
were either enrolled at a Community College located on
the outskirts of an industrial city of a few hundred
thousand residents or at a mid-sized State University
located in a semi-rural area approximately 20 miles
outside the city's limits. The Midwestern Community
College (MWCC) serves as a feeder school to the
Midwestern State University (MWSU). MWSU is
moderately selective and serves a predominately
residential undergraduate student population.
At MWCC, five sections of introductory Biology 201 for
health and science career majors were assessed. In addition,
MWCC participants were tested from three sections of
Microbiology 251--the third course in the biology
sequence. Fortunately, the testing went well in Biology 201.
Unfortunately, the projector and computer combination in
the Microbiology classroom did not sync with the MS Excel
program that was being used as the official timer. It could
have been the computer was incompatible with the
projector, or the computer's operating system was
incompatible with the special software coding being
used by the timer's MS Excel file, or the computer's
microprocessor was too slow. Thus, the RAN of Objects
results for the three sections of the Microbiology class
results could not be used in the study's grand mean.
Consequently, the results from the microbiology students
on the PSVT:R were also excluded from the study's grand
mean. Nonetheless, the PSVT:R for these Microbiology
students will be used for comparative purposes in the
"visual analysis" section.
At the university level, professors volunteered their
classes from a variety of fields. These included one
freshman/sophomore-level art printmaking and one
freshman/sophomore-level 3-D art course, one sophomore-
level music theory (Aural Music IV), three senior-level Early
Childhood Education (ECE) reading assessment, two senior-
level Middle Childhood Education (MCE) reading
assessment, three senior-level Adolescent and Young Adult
(AYA) classroom assessment classes, one introductory
calculus for math and science majors, and one junior-level
industrial hygiene class. Although both art classes were
freshman/sophomore level, there was little overlap in which
art majors were taking the two courses the semester they
were assessed. Finally, it must be noted that no engineering
courses were enrolled because MWSU does not have an
engineering program.
All 356 students were tested at the beginning of the
semester. About half of these students were tested a second
time at the end of the semester to determine if there were
any classes which improved the visual processing of
enrolled students. Most of the research team would have
hypothesized that the 3-D art class would have had the best
prospect of improving visualization ability. No class had
marked improvement.
In statistical terms, it is recognized that each student's
data are an artifact of each student being nested within a
particular section, a particular class type, within a given
field, and within a given university situation. In general,
4 SAGE Open
class type was used when conducting statistical analysis of
the numerical data and visual analysis of the scatterplots.
Nonetheless, for each section of a class, a visual analysis of
the scatterplots and a statistical analysis of the numerical
data were conducted to see if they represented the same
trend as the class as a whole.
Instrumentation
Self-reported data. During the class session before the
assessments were administered, professors distributed a
cover letter that explained the purpose of the study. They
also distributed a permission slip approved by the Internal
Review Boards of both MWCC and MWSU. Then, during
the next class session, members of the research team would
show an MS Power Point presentation that explained the
purpose of the study. Students were also given a chance to
ask questions about the tests, the permission slip, and/or
their ability to opt out of taking the assessments. Because
various members of the research team presented the MS
Power Point to a given class, there could easily have been
different points of emphasis and tones.
After the MS Power Point, participants were asked to
answer 12 demographic questions. Some questions
pertained to grade level, age, gender, and college major. As
there were only five possible responses to the questions
about the ethnic/racial background of the students, some
students expressed discontent and wished more choices,
such as "multi-racial," had been offered as opposed to
African American, Asian American, White European
American, Hispanic American, and International
Student/ESL. The last category was meant to separate out
students who might be naming objects in their second
language.
PSVT:R. After reviewing numerous tests purporting to
measure "visualization," the team members settled on
Bodner and Guay's (1997) PSVT:R sub-test as a good core
assessment of visualization to be used for this study. On a
written request to use the assessment, and to eventually post
an online version of it, Bodner himself sent the research
team a 20-question version with a 10-min time limit. One
reason for choosing the PSVT:R was that it seems to
measure a key component of visualization that would be
required for doing well in math and science:
The spatial visualization factor measures the ability to mentally
restructure or manipulate the components of the visual stimulus
and involves recognizing, retaining, and recalling
configurations when the figure or parts of the figure are moved.
(Bodner & Guay, 1997, p. 6)
The PSVT:R also had four other key features that would
make it easy to give within the 20 to 25 min time frame
(i.e., half a typical 50 min college class) that even the art
and music professors were willing to allot:
a. The PSVT:R assessment has a 10-min time limit.
b. The PSVT:R was designed to be given to large
groups.
c. Many researchers have used the PSVT:R in the
previously mentioned studies of college students
(Charyton, Jagacinski, Merrill, Clifton, & DeDios,
2011; Sorby, 2000) or in studies finding visualization
effects in outside the classroom situations (Lathan &
Tracey, 2002; Menchaca-Brandan et al., 2007; Piburn
et al., 2005).
d. The PSVT:R is an open source and therefore costs
nothing to administer to hundreds of students.
See Figure 1 for the introductory sample question from
the PSVT:R.
It should also be noted that in a personal communication,
Sorby (May 24, 2012) mentioned that the standard version
of the PSVT:R has 30 questions in which 20 min are
allotted, and that her team had developed a 10-question
version in which participants were allotted 7 min.
Mathematically, it would then stand to reason that a 20-
question version should have been allotted 14 min. As will
be explained later, results also supported a 14 min limit.
Thus, the online version for future studies was given a 14
min time limit instead of a 10-min limit.
RAN of Objects. The Rapid Automatic Naming (RAN) of
Objects assessment used in this study was developed by
Wiig et al. (1982) to help screen for Specific Language
Impairments (SLI) in elementary schools. In addition,
Wiig et al. mention that their assessment should be useful
for screening for Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD) and
dyscalculia. Wiig et al.'s assessment has eight objects
arranged in an 8 × 4 grid in which six items are repeated 4
times, one object is repeated 5 times, and another object is
repeated 3 times. The object names of key, comb, pen,
ring, book, cup, cat, spoon would have been familiar to
the 8-year-olds used in Wiig et al.'s study as well as the
college students used in this study (though when
practicing, college students often named the spoon as
tennis racquet or magnifying glass). The names were
purposely chosen by Wiig et al. to intermix the /k/ sound
in the first and last position in five of the eight words,
while the nasals of /m/,/ n/, and /ng/ are intermixed in four
of the eight words. Each of the eight words contains a
different medial vowel sound.
The protocol asks the test administrator to have the
participant practice naming the objects in advance of the
tests so as to allow clarification and ensure everyone is
calling the spoon a spoon as magnifying glass or tennis
racquet would take longer to say than spoon. Consequently,
any hesitations and/or misnamings would be assumed to
occur more often due to the processing difficulties posed by
memory searching and/or the phonological processing
needed to complete the task.

Like the PSVT:R, one reason for choosing Wiig et al.
(1982) RAN of Objects assessment is that it is open source.
Another reason is that Wiig et al. report that the RAN of
Objects is relatively immune to improvement through
practice on the task. Then, in a more recent study, Wiig,
Zureich, and Chan (2000) found that teenagers with
diagnosed learning disabilities continued to have slower
RAN of Objects times than matched aged control students.
In contrast, Wiig et al. (2000) found that other assessments
of RAN, such as those focusing on numbers, letters, and
sight words, lose their predictive value for speech,
language, and SLD as the students learn the academic skill,
and become fluent in naming the numbers, letters, and
numbers. Thus, Wiig et al.'s RAN of Objects assessment
should prove useful for longitudinal studies.
As was mentioned earlier, the fine arts and literacy
assessment professors who allowed us into their classes
preferred that the assessment battery be completed within a
20 to 25 min time frame (half of a typical college class
period). Thus, it was clear that it would be too time-
consuming to have three or four graduate students
individually assess all the students enrolled in a 50-person
class. As a concession to time limitations, each participant
was asked to concentrate on naming the objects amid the
verbal chaos of a simultaneous reading, and then when they
were finished they were asked to look up at a projected
timer and record their own time.
Because of fortuitous extenuating circumstances in
several classes, 58 students took the test one-on-one
AFTER taking it en masse. For example, one professor let
6 SAGE Open
us administer the assessments on the day he was leaving to
attend a conference. Thus, after he introduced us, he left for
the airport, and we had 48 min to show the power point,
have students fill out the survey, take the PSVT:R, and take
the RAN of Objects Assessment both en masse and one-on-
one. Even with the extra time required to administer the
RAN of Objects assessment one-on-one, class members
were happy because we let them out 10 to 15 min early.
The correlation between the en masse and one-on-one
administrations was r = .638 and p < .001. Admittedly, this
demonstrates the en masse administration made the results
less reliable and valid, but lower validity was already a
given as Wiig et al.'s assessment was designed for
elementary school students and had not been used on
college students. (See the results of Aural Music IV for
more explication on the slightly lower r value than normally
considered "valid" and "reliable.").
Grades. At the end of the spring semester, every professor
whose class participated in the study sent the research team
a list of each student's name, ID number, the letter grade,
and the percentage the student earned in the class. The
percentages were then converted to z scores to compare one
class to another. The research team was aware that there
were differences among classes of different grade levels,
and although they were not ideal, z scores seemed like they
would be the best comparative tool.
Results
Overall Statistics Related to PSVT:R
Table 1 contains the overall means for the PSVT:R and the
RAN of Objects. For the PSVT:R, Table 2 contains the
average PSVT:R percentages and standard deviations for all
nine class types sorted from highest to lowest. Table 2 reveals
that there was a large gap between the highest class average of
70.91% for Printmaking at MWSU, and the lowest class
average of 51.76 for Biology 201 at the MWCC. As depicted
in Table 3, an ANOVA followed by a Tukey's analysis (see
Table 4) revealed there was a statistical difference between
Biology 201 and the classes of Music Theory IV and Calculus
for Math and Science Majors. Due to smaller class sizes,
neither printmaking nor 3-D art were found to be significantly
different from Biology 201. Although, when combined into a
single category of "visual arts," the combined class was
significantly different from that of Biology 201.

As discussed earlier, the average percentage for the
PSVT:R in MWCC's Microbiology 251 was not included in
the grand mean, because the projector, computer, and/or
MS Excel timer did not sync well. Nevertheless, the
average PSVT:R percentage for this third course in the
MWCC's biology sequence for biology and health career
majors was 64.16%. This percentage is right in line with the
PSVT:R percentages for MWSU's Industrial Hygiene for
health career majors (64%).
Brief Discussion of PSVT:R Results
In many ways, the fact that the Biology 201 PSVT:R scores
were the lowest of any class measured seems rather
incongruous with the hypothesis that students enrolled in
math and science courses would tend to attain high scores
on the PSVT:R. Even more so as Biology 201 is the first
course in the sequence of courses designed for future
biology majors while Biology 101 would be the course non-
majors would take. Nonetheless, the community college has
an open enrollment policy while the university has
minimum requirements for ACT scores. Furthermore, other
than the three fine arts courses, the university students
would have been required to have taken or placed out of the

university's introductory level math courses before taking the
upper grade level course where they were assessed for this
study. Thus, it is important to note that 11 students enrolled
in Biology 201 scored more than 2 standard deviations below
the grand mean (approximately 20% or less) for
visualization, then two courses later in the sequence only 1
student in Microbiology 251, and no students enrolled in the
university, scored that low. Thus, Biology 201 seems to be an
MWCC course that serves to either: (a) that improve the
visualization skills of potential science and health
professionals who come to school with low visualization
ability; or (b) sort out students who are low in visualization
ability from completing the Bio sequence.
Furthermore, the fact that Aural Music IV and a
combined score for Printmaking and 3-D art would be
significantly higher than Biology 201 supports a prima facie
logic test that music majors and visual arts majors would be
better at visualization.
It also seems to be important to point out that Sorby (2000)
and Boersma et al. (2004) set a cut-off percentage of 60% for
determining whether engineering students should be advised to
take a mini-course in visualization. The average PSVT:R
percentages for all the courses, except Biology 201 and Early
Childhood Literacy Assessment, exceeded the cut-off
percentage of 60%. And the Early Childhood average percent
correct of 58% was off by less than one wrong answer.
Overall Statistics Related to RAN of Objects
As can be seen in Table 5, on the RAN of Objects
assessment there was nearly a 2-s gap between the fastest
class average time of 16.79 s for Aural Music IV and the
slowest class average time of 18.47 for Middle Childhood
Reading Assessment. Nonetheless, an ANOVA followed by
a Tukey's analysis revealed no statistical differences
between any classes matched against any other class.
In contrast, when looking at the individual student, a
statistically significant multiplier was found that indicated
slower times might lead to better class grades. For example,
for each second, longer a student took to complete the RAN
of Objects assessment, the student had a 1.04 greater chance
to earn a course grade that was half a standard deviation
above the mean for that particular course.
Brief Discussion of RAN of Objects Results
The fact that there were no statistically significant
differences from one class to another on RAN of Objects
seems to suggest that students do not use their intuitive
sense of their own naming speed to influence their choice of
a major. This was supported by the demographic survey's
self-identification profiles when there was a statistically
significant correlation of r = .398 between how a student
thought they would do on the PSVT:R and how well they
actually did. In contrast, there was a much lower, though
still highly significant correlation of only r = .169 between
a student's prediction of being fast or slow and their actual
results (see Table 6).
Yet, the fact that for every second slower a student takes to
complete the RAN of Objects assessment increases the odds
the student will do well in a given course, suggests that
college professors might "value" whatever benefits slow times
on RAN of Objects tests might bequeath to a given individual.
In essence, the National Early Literacy Panel (2008) and
notable researchers such as Denckla and Rudel (1974, 1976a,
1976b); Fawcett and Nicolson (1994); Korhonen (1991,
1995); Spring and Perry (1983); Torgesen (1988); Wolff,

Visual analysis of MWCC's Bio 201. A quick visual analysis of
the scatterplot for Biology 201 (see Figure 2) indicates that
the students enrolled in Biology 201 are spread fairly evenly
between the four quadrants defined by the PSVT:R
percentages and RAN of Objects times. Although, a closer
inspection reveals that there are many more students in the
lower left quadrant than the upper right quadrant. Also, a
visual analysis of the scatterplots for Biology 201, found
that 11 students scored more than 2 standard deviations
below the mean for PSVT:R. Then, when the scatterplots
for all of the other classes were analyzed, only 1 MWCC's
Microbiology 251 student and no MWSU student scored
more than 2 standard deviations below the mean. Hence, a
reasonable conjecture would be the community college's
open admission policy allowed some students to enroll in
Biology 201 who were either low on visualization or less
motivated than their counterparts to take the PSVT:R
assessment seriously.
Visual analysis of MWSU's Early Childhood Literacy Assessment.
Students enrolled in the Early Childhood Reading
Assessment class at MWSU (see Figure 3) mirrored the
results of the students enrolled in Biology 201 at MWCC,
with students found in all four quadrants (compare Figures
2 and 3). One major difference being that the extremes in
all four directions were muted with most students within 1
standard deviation of the grand mean of both visualization
and processing speed. In particular, as was already noted,
there were 11 students enrolled in Biology 201 who scored
more than 2 standard deviations below the Grand Mean on
the PSVT:R, whereas, there were no students enrolled in
Early Childhood Reading Assessment or any other class at
MWSU who scored this low. The fact that there were no
students with extremely low scores on the PSVT:R could be
explained because Early Childhood majors may NOT enroll
in the assessment class UNTIL they (a) pass a 200-level
course targeting math skills, (b) earn a 3.2 overall GPA
(grade point average), AND (c) either pass the Praxis I
exam with a 172 on the math section or earn a 22 on the
ACT.
Verbal analysis of MWSU's Calculus class for math and science
majors. A similar "centered" pattern was found in the
Calculus class for math and science majors. The key
difference between Calculus, Early Childhood Literacy
Assessment, and Biology 201, is that the top score for
Calculus was almost 1 standard deviation higher than it was
for Early Childhood Literacy Assessment, and the lowest
score was between the mean and 1 standard deviation below
the mean. This is higher than that between 1 and 2 standard
deviations below the mean for Early Childhood Literacy
Assessment, and more than 2 standard deviations below the
mean for 11 students enrolled in Biology 201.
As noted earlier, the PSVT:R scores for calculus were
found to be significantly different from those of Biology
201. Thus, as predicted by the previous results of Eisenberg
and McGinty (1977), for the class average of 3-D
visualization there was trend up the Y-axis when moving
from Biology 201, to Early Childhood Reading Assessment,
and on to Calculus. Based on course prerequisites and the
demands of the fields, presumably scores on a norm-
referenced math assessment such as the Praxis I, the ACT,
and/or the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) would
follow the same upward trend.
It should also be noted that a few sections of
Microbiology 251, the third course in the sequence of
courses for MWCC biology majors, also participated in
this study. As noted earlier, there was a projector,
computer, and/or software synchronization issue with the
MS Excel timing program and so the PSVT:R scores and
RAN of Objects were not included in the Grand Mean.
Nonetheless, the average PSVT:R score for Microbiology
251 was 64.16%. This percent falls in line with scores for
the PSVT:R averages for Industrial Hygiene (64%) at
MWSU.
Visual analysis of MWSU's Aural Music IV. A quick visual
inspection of Aural Music IV suggests that most of the
students were located in the upper-left quadrant of Fast
RAN times and High Visualization scores (see Figure 4).
A closer visual analysis indicates all but 7 of the 55
students were faster than the grand mean on the RAN of
Objects. A check through the self-promoted demographic
profiles of these seven students found that all seven of
these individuals self-identified as ambidextrous. This
created a distinct contrast with their classmates as NONE
of their classmates who were faster than the mean self-
identified as ambidextrous. This might suggest more
detailed interviews are needed to determine underlying
factors of this fast/slow divide, especially as other
researchers such as Goldberg (2001) have noted
ambidexterity can be a hallmark of creativity and the fact
students are using both hemispheres of the brain; or in
terms of MacLeod (1991), creative students may be
using more parallel processors.
Plus, going back to the correlation between the
individual administration of the RAN of Objects correlation
of r = .638 and p < .001, it is interesting to note that it was
the Aural Music IV class which not only had the fastest
average time of 16.79 s, but the largest standard deviation
of 7.66 s. The fastest average times seems to make prima
facie sense for a major where musicians are trained to
simultaneously try to fit into the group while paying
attention to their own score and performance; this is
because they would tend to be less flustered by aural chaos.
However, the largest standard deviation seems to be
surfacing another neurological trait of those who were
simultaneously slower than the grand mean and
ambidextrous. Future studies could target musicians to ask
them what field of music they were majoring in and
whether they were training to become a performer, director,
or composer.

Discriminant analysis and statistical limitations. At the request
of two reviewers, a discriminant analysis of the high school
teachers was conducted. As could be expected from the
above description, there was no statistical significance
found when social studies teachers were included in the
discriminant analysis. This is because the social studies
formed bi-modal clusters where approximately half fell into
the quadrant of science teachers and the other half fell into
the caddy-corner quadrant of language arts teachers.
In contrast, when focusing on science, math, and
language arts teachers as being situated in distinct quadrants
defined by the RAN of Objects and PSVT:R, for Function 1
the Eigenvalue was .628, the percentage of the variance was
67.2, and the canonical correlation was .621. For Function
2, the Eigenvalue was .307, the percentage of the variance
was 32.8, and the canonical correlation was .485.
Next, for Test of Functions 1 to 2, the Wilks's lambda
was .470 and the chi-square was 15.477 with 4 degrees of
freedom and a significance of .004. For the Test of Function
2, the Wilks's lambda was .765 and the chi-square was
6.486 with 1 degree of freedom and a significance of .019.
Finally, in a discriminant analysis, the baseline
percentages for randomly assigning a given individual to a
particular group would be
Future Science teachers: .208 (n = 5)
Future Math teachers: .375 (n = 9)
Future Language Arts teachers: .417 (n = 10)
Compared with these baseline percentages, 66.7% of the
cases were categorized correctly for "original grouped cases,"
and 62.5% of cases were categorized correctly for "cross-
validated grouped cases." Thus, the categorization of science
teachers is considerably above the generally accepted
standard of 25% greater than baseline, while the
categorizations of math and language teachers straddled the
borderline of the generally accepted standard of 25% greater
than baseline. (It should be noted that the ns listed above do
not necessarily match up with the number of dots on a given
scatterplot because 2 or 3 students might have the same
match of PSVT:R percent and RAN of Objects time.)
Admittedly, conducting a series of statistical tests
including the discriminant analysis, the Wilks's lambda,
chi-square, and one by one ANOVA comparisons run into
all sorts of methodological issues because statistical
analysis was performed on sub-samples that were not
specifically proposed in the research questions. Similarly,
the Bonferroni adjustments that would be needed could
negate the statistical significance, especially if similar
breakout comparisons were made for every participating
class in regard to the exact major of every single student in
the class. Nonetheless, in this exploratory study, the after
the fact discriminant analyses and ANOVAs support the
reasonableness of using visual inspections based on the
logic of single-subject research described by Kazdin (1982).
Then, in the future targeted studies where the research
questions would focus solely on differences between high
school science, math, and language arts teachers, there
would not be as many statistical adjustments needed.
Patterns for Other Classes That Were Tested
In general, the pattern for all of the other classes was
centrist in regard to both RAN of Objects and Visualization.
Though there was a subset of four Middle Childhood social
studies teachers who had Low Visualization scores and
slow times on the RAN of Objects. Thus, these four Middle
Childhood social studies teachers mimicked the cluster of
High School social studies teachers.
Limitations
Limitations include the fact that Wiig et al. (1982) RAN of
Objects test was being used for adults when it was normed
using students in elementary school. Furthermore, the RAN
of Objects test was administered en masse to reduce the
time spent in a given classroom and reduce the number of
graduate students required to help proctor a testing session.
Thus, there are no pre-existing "norms" for comparison. In
addition, though math and science majors were assessed,
there is no engineering program at the university where
most of the testing was conducted. Next, the test results
surfaced questions that should be added to the demographic
survey. For example, it would be good to know whether a
given individual enrolled in Music Theory IV was interested
in musical composition, performance, teaching, and/or
directing.
What cannot be determined without a longitudinal study
is whether students intuitively chose a major because their
pre-existing thinking style matched the thinking style
required to succeed in the field, or whether students chose a
given field and then they were shaped into thinking in a
certain way by the way the subject is taught.
Discussion
As noted in the introduction, back in 1977 Eisenberg and
McGinty published an article describing how visualization
predicted a student's field of study. What this study adds to
previous research on visualization is that it contains both a
test for 3-D visualization (Bodner & Guay, 1997) as well as
one for RAN of Objects (Wiig et al., 1982), and the results
suggest both assessments may be needed to give
appropriate guidance to students about their future
academic majors and career choices.
The premise that RAN of Objects might surface
differences in choice of college majors originates from the
fields of special education and speech and language
pathology. Researchers in these fields have long used RAN
of Objects assessments to screen for pre-school and
Oldrieve and Bertelsen

kindergarten students who struggle to learn how to speak
fluently, develop phonemic awareness, and ultimately learn
how to read. Thus, it only makes sense that RAN of Objects
might also sort where students with slow RAN of Objects
times end up in college if they learn how to read, write, and
do arithmetic.
As noted earlier, researchers such as Corina et al. (2001)
have used the Aesop's fable of the tortoise and the hare to
describe how students with learning disabilities might end
up successful. Our research team suggests that a metaphor
of a tortoise living in the appropriate ecological niche of
Darwin's Galapagos Islands might better explain this
study's counter-intuitive findings. For example, there was a
statistically significant multiplier that for every second
SLOWER a college student took to complete the RAN of
Objects Assessment, the student had greater odds of earning
a high grade in the class he or she was enrolled. Or, the
supporting counter-intuitive finding that as fast times on
RAN of Objects assessments are typically associated with
early reading success (National Early Literacy Panel, 2008),
it would seem that future language arts teachers would be
found in the bottom-left-hand corner of low Visualization
and fast RAN of Objects; instead this study found them in
the bottom right hand corner where they had low
Visualization and slow RAN of Objects.
Yes, there undoubtedly is a chicken or the egg
component to any field of academic learning. As Sorby
(2000) and her colleagues (Boersma et al., 2004; Medina et
al., 1998) have shown, engineering students who score
below 60 on the PSVT:R benefit from taking a 10-week
course in visualization. Compared with their low scoring
peers who do not take the 10-week visualization course,
students who take the course have increased GPAs and
graduation rates. Thus, direct training in how to visualize 3-
D objects was effective in helping students "think like an
engineer." Similarly, Bruner (1999) said the goal of a math
teacher should be to have their students learn how to think
like a mathematician and that science teachers should be
helping their students think like scientists. Thus, in the
process of teaching their students to think like
mathematicians, scientists, poets, and so on, the professors
and teachers of any academic discipline may also be
shaping the cognitive processing of their students. Yet, it
could also be true that more explicit training in the
underlying neurologically based skills needed to think like a
high school science, math, and social studies teacher might
make future teachers better prepared to teach their subject
area.
Future Directions
This study supports the research of Eisenberg and McGinty
(1977) who found that visualization skill tends to be higher
in college students majoring in math or science than for
elementary education majors. This study expands on their
work by also finding that students majoring in music and
the visual arts match or even better the visualization skills
of future math and science majors. Finally, this research
project found that a combination of PSVT:R percentages
and RAN of Objects time creates scatterplots on which
students in different majors cluster either in a centrist
position or in one of four quadrants. To provide more
support and added depth for these findings, our research
team proposes four lines of follow-up research.
First, several larger n studies are needed to
specifically target future and current high school science
and math teachers. These larger n studies could then
provide stronger evidence that except for approximately
a 30% overlap near the grand mean, there are statistically
significant categorical differences in the RAN of Objects
times between high school science and math teachers.
Furthermore, if this difference is confirmed, STEM
educators could provide more guidance to prospective
math and science teachers and help them choose the
subject area which fits their cognitive profile. For
example, prospective teachers who are deciding whether
to teach high school math and/or science could be tested
for their RAN of Objects times. Then, individuals who
name objects more than half of a standard deviation faster
than the grand mean, could be counseled to become
science teachers. In contrast, those who name more than
half of a standard deviation slower than the mean could
be counseled to become a high school math teacher.
Finally, individuals whose time is close to the grand
mean might be counseled to pursue both math and
science teaching--so that they could make themselves
more marketable to small school districts. In contrast, a
future teacher who does not receive appropriate guidance
and chooses incorrectly might decide to quit teaching
altogether because they sense they do not fit in with their
colleagues. This would be particularly regretful if the
prospective teacher perceived that they were feeling
uncomfortable due to difference in race, religion, gender,
or sexual identify.
Second, as is represented in Figure 10, our research team
theorizes the thinking styles reflected in this study's
scatterplots align with the four types of thinking outlined by
Rowe and Neitzel (2010). To prove this, a longitudinal
study is needed that tracks students from kindergarten until
they go to college and choose a major and career.
Third, even though this study showed high school math
teachers have profiles of high visualization and slow
cognitive processing, our research team predicts that
accountants and other mathematically related professions
with precise regimentation will end up in the quadrant of
high visualization and fast cognitive processing. Similarly,
even though future science teachers ended up in the
quadrant of high visualization and fast processing, our
research team predicts many theoretical physicists,
chemists, biologists, and/or economists with fuzzy logic
tendencies would tend to end up in the quadrant of high
visualization and slow processing.
