The introduction of a specific International Classification of Diseases code for rotavirus diarrhea
in 1992 prompted examination of the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) for trends in
rotavirus-associated hospitalizations among US children aged 1 month through 4 years. During
1993­1995, 13.5% of hospitalizations were associated with diarrhea (n Å 162,478/year). Rotavirus
was the most common pathogen identified, coded in 16.5% of diarrhea cases (n Å 26,798/year), and
increased from 13.3% in 1993 to 18.9% in 1995. The age distribution and seasonality of hospitaliza-
tions of presumed noninfectious and viral etiology resembled those associated with rotavirus. Rotavi-
rus was reported as a cause of diarrhea more frequently by hospitals that were large (§100 beds),
proprietary-owned, or in the West/Midwest. Although these findings suggest incomplete detection
of rotavirus diarrhea cases, the large number of rotavirus-associated hospitalizations underscores
the need for vaccines and indicates that NHDS data could be used to monitor the impact of a US
rotavirus immunization program.
Recent trials involving tetravalent rhesus rotavirus vaccine States, based on extrapolation from a single prospective study
