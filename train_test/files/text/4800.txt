Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the effects of zolpidem on functional recovery in a rat model of acute
ischemic stroke.
Methods: Following ischemic stroke procedures, 42 rats (six in each group) were randomly
assigned to receive zolpidem (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 or 4.0 mg/kg) or normal saline administer
intraperitoneally once daily for two weeks. Motor behavioural index (MBI) scores, radial 8-arm
maze (RAM) test times and brain MRI scans were obtained 24 hours (Day 1) and two weeks (Day
14) post-procedure. Immunohistochemistry was performed on Day 14.
Results: By comparison with the normal saline group, the 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg zolpidem groups
showed statistically significant improvements in MBI scores and increased numbers of brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) stained cells over the two week dosing period. By contrast,
the 4.0 mg/kg zolpidem group had statistically significantly impaired MBI scores compared with the
control group. No differences among groups were found in RAM times or infarction volumes.

Introduction
Sleep is frequently disturbed after neuro-
logic disorders including stroke.1 Reports
suggest that approximately two thirds of
patients with ischemic stroke suffer from
symptoms of insomnia in the initial stage2
and sleep disturbance is thought to attenu-
ate stroke recovery and neuroplasticity.3
Insomnia after a stroke aggravates brain
damage and causes oxidative stress resulting
in the formation of reactive oxygen species
which may eventually lead to neuronal and
cellular damage.4 Therefore, an effective
sleep management protocol should be an
essential part of patient care following a
stroke.
Zolpidem, a short-acting and non-benzo-
diazepine related hypnotic that enhances the
gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)A
recep-
tor function by binding selectively to the
omega-1 receptor subtype, is often pre-
scribed for the management of post-stroke
sleep disturbance.5­7 It is known that hyp-
notics acting on the GABAA
receptor, espe-
cially benzodiazepines, produce anterograde
amnesia and can impair daytime cognitive
function and synaptic plasticity.8­10 In con-
trast with benzodiazepines, zolpidem has
similar hypnotic efficacy but more favour-
able safety and tolerability profiles.11
Furthermore, zolpidem has been shown, in
an in vitro study in hippocampal cells, to
exert antioxidant and neuroprotective
effects against oxidative stress and neuronal
death induced by glutamate.12 During
acute ischemic stroke, cell membrane
depolarization, excessive release of excita-
tory neurotransmitters, including glutamate
and Ca2þ influx endangers neurons in the
ischemic penumbra.13,14 One study found
that pregabalin, which is an analogue of
GABA, reduced excessive release of glutam-
ate and protected neurons against
Ca2þoverload in ischemic stroke.15 Not
only is zolpidem GABAergic but it also
has neuroprotective and anti-oxidant prop-
erties.16 However, one study found that
zolpidem inhibited neural plasticity in the
acute stroke period.17
To date, there have been no studies
examining the effects, beneficial or harmful,
of zolpidem on functional recovery follow-
ing a stroke. Therefore, the objective of this
present study was to evaluate the effects of
zolpidem on behavioural function, neural
plasticity and memory in a rat model of
acute ischemic stroke and to examine pos-
sible antioxidant properties.
Materials and methods
Rat model of ischemic stroke
Six-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats
(220­280 g) were housed in laboratory
cages in a controlled environment (22.0­
24.0C) and kept under a 12/12 h dark/light
cycle with free access to food and water.
This study was approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Medical Research Institute in Kangbuk
Samsung Hospital, Republic of Korea
250 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
The model of ischemic stroke in the rat
was produced by the Longa method,18
whereby the middle cerebral artery was
occluded for two hours and re-perfused.
Rats were anaesthetized with 2% isoflurane
(1:2 mixture of O2
/N2
O) and heating pads
were used to maintain their body tempera-
ture 36­38C. A 3 cm incision was made
over the middle of the neck and the left
common carotid artery exposed. After sep-
aration of the internal and external carotid
arteries, a 4/0 nylon filament with a rounded
tip was inserted into the bifurcation of the
common carotid artery until the nylon tip
occluded the common carotid artery. The
inserted nylon was removed after two hours
of occlusion for the transient focal cerebral
infarction.
Behavioural function measurements
To investigate the effects of zolpidem on
motor recovery after an acute ischemic
injury, rats were randomly assigned to one
of seven groups (i.e., 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0,
or 4.0 mg/kg zolpidem or normal saline) and
treatments were administered by intraper-
itoneal (IP) injection once daily (i.e., 10 am)
for two weeks starting the day after the
ischemic stroke procedure (Day 1). Weight
was measured on Day 1 and two weeks later
(Day 14) and the percentage ratio calcu-
lated. Behavioural function was measured
by a blinded researcher (K.J.Y.) on Day 1
and Day 14 using the motor behavioural
index (MBI). 19 The half-life of zolpidem is
2­3 hours20 and so scores were measured at
3 pm to avoid its sleeping effect. The MBI
which has six items (i.e., spontaneous activ-
ity, symmetry of the four limbs, forepaw
outstretching, climbing, body propriocep-
tion and response to vibrissae touch) has a
total score range of 3­18 with high scores
indicating better behavioural function than
lower scores. The ratio in MBI (%) was
calculated as the score at Day 14/the score at
Day 1 Â 100.
Memory function measurements
To assess the effect of the zolpidem on
memory function, the radial 8-arm maze
(RAM) test was performed at 3 pm on Day 1
and Day 14. The RAM has eight U-shaped
horizontal runways (10 Â 15 Â 50 cm), which
were placed radially around a hexagonal
platform (10 cm) on the floor surrounded by
visual markers. After food restriction for
half a day, rats were placed on the hexagonal
platform and allowed to find and eat four
hidden sugar baits out of eight pellets which
were set at the end of each arm. Rats were
pre-trained twice daily for five days before
the ischemic stroke procedure. All situations
including the location of RAM on the floor
and the sugar bait pellets were identical. The
time taken to find and eat four sugar bait
pellets was recorded by one blinded investi-
gator (K.J.Y.). The ratio in RAM (%) was
calculated as the time at Day 14/the time at
Day 1 Â 100.
Brain imaging
MRI scans of the brain were performed on
Day 1 and Day 14 to evaluate the change in
infarction volume. Rats were anesthetized
with an IP injection of 1.0% ketamine and
placed on a 4.7 T Bruker Biospec Imager
(Bruker medical system, Kalsruhe,
Germany). The warm magnetic bore main-
tained the rats' body temperature. The
protocol for MRI imaging included a diffu-
sion weighted image (DWI) sequence (TR/
TE ¼ 2000/80 ms) and a T2-weighted image
(T2WI) sequence (TR/TE ¼ 4500/80 ms).
The slice thickness was 1.5 mm and the
matrix size was 256 Â 256. The infarction
volumes which were measured by a blinded
researcher (Y.T.L.) using Paravision 3.0
software (Bruker Biospec, Ettlingen,
Germany) were obtained from DWI at
Day 1 (V1D) and T2WI at Day 14 (V2W).
The ratio in infarction volume (%) was
calculated as V2W/V1D x 100.

Immunohistochemistry
On Day 14, rats were anesthetized with
isoflurane and perfused transcardially with
phosphate-buffered solution. Brains were
removed, fixed in 10% formalin for one
week, dehydrated in a graded ethanol
series, embedded in paraffin, and processed
for a paraffin block which was cut in
6mm thick sections. For immunostaining,
the sections were de-paraffinized in
xylene, rehydrated in a graded series of
ethanol, washed with normal saline and
microwaved in citrate buffer for 10 min.
Hydrogen peroxide was used to block
endogenous peroxidase activity which
enhanced nonspecific immunoreactivity.
Two antibodies, brain-derived neuro-
trophic factor (BDNF, ab6201, 1/50,
Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and indu-
cible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, ab3523,
1/20, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) were
used to evaluate the upregulation of neural
plasticity and antioxidant effects, respect-
ively.21,22 Immunostained sections were
digitized using a 40 Â objective (Leica
DFC 290, Leica, Heerbrugg, Germany) in
conjunction with the Leica Application
suite (version 3.3.0, Leica). Five views
from each area of the peri-lesional
site were assessed by a pathologist blinded
to the experimental conditions (S.W.C.)
and stained cells were counted and
averaged.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS software (PASW Statistics for
WindowsÕ, version 18.0. Chicago, USA.).
Data were analysed using the Kruskal­
Wallis test and a P-value < 0.05 was con-
sidered to indicate statistical significance.
The Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni
correction was used to analyse between
group differences if the P-value was
significant.
Results
In total, 42 rats, six in each group, were
randomly assigned to one of seven groups
(i.e., 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, or 4.0 mg/kg
zolpidem or normal saline). There were no
statistically significant differences among the
groups in rat weight or MBI at Day 1. The
weights (g, mean Æ SD) of the 0.1, 0.25, 0.5,
1.0, 2.0, 4.0 mg/kg zolpidem and normal
saline groups were 165.3 Æ 10.8, 180.0 Æ
17.3, 165.7 Æ 12.8, 178.8 Æ 41.3, 173.1 Æ
12.4, 198.3 Æ 38.0 and 191.3 Æ 42.3, respect-
ively. MBI scores (mean Æ SD) for the 0.1,
0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 mg/kg zolpidem and
normal saline groups were 8.0 Æ 0.9,
8.0 Æ 2.1, 8.0 Æ 1.7, 8.0 Æ 2.0, 9.2 Æ 1.9,
9.2 Æ 1.0 and 8.3 Æ 1.4, respectively.
For weight ratio, there were no differ-
ences among the groups from Day 1 to Day
14. For MBI ratio (%), compared with the
normal saline group, the zolpidem 0.5 mg/kg
and 1.0 mg/kg groups had statistically sig-
nificantly (P < 0.005) better improvements
in scores over the two weeks (Figure 1). By
contrast, the group receiving zolpidem
4.0 mg/kg had a statistically significant
(P < 0.005) deterioration in scores compared
with the group receiving normal saline
(Figure 1).
For RAM, there were no differences
among the groups at Day 1. With the excep-
tion of the zolpidem 2.0 mg/kg and 4.0 mg/kg
groups which were excluded from the ana-
lysis because of incomplete data, there was
also no difference among groups in the
Day14/Day 1 RAM ratio. Initial RAM
times (sec, meanÆ SD) for the 0.1, 0.25, 0.5,
1.0 mg/kg zolpidem and normal saline groups
were 46.0Æ 2.7, 45.4Æ 1.6, 46.1 Æ 2.6, 45.1 Æ
2.3 and 48.4Æ 3.1, respectively. RAM ratios
(%, meanÆ SD) for the 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 mg/
kg zolpidem and normal saline groups were
61.8 Æ 4.3, 62.7 Æ 6.1, 61.6 Æ 6.2, 63.0Æ 6.0
and 64.7Æ 11.2, respectively.
Brain MRI scans showed that there were
no statistically significant differences in
252 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
infarction volumes among the groups at
Day 1 or in the ratio of infarction volumes
Day 1 to Day 14 (Figure 2).
Immunohistochemistry showed that by
comparison with the normal saline group,
the zolpidem 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg
groups had statistically significantly
(P < 0.001) increased numbers of BDNF
stained cells (Figures 3a and 4a). However,
there were no differences among groups in
the expression of iNOS (Figures 3b and 4b).
Discussion
This present study showed that two weeks
after a stroke, rats in the 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg
zolpidem groups had significant improve-
ment in behavioural function compared
with rats in the control group. In addition,
the same two zolpidem dose groups had
significantly increased numbers of BDNF
stained cells compared with the control
group which indicated upregulation of
neural plasticity.21 However, there was no
difference in iNOS expression among the
groups suggesting that functional recovery
with zolpidem was not associated with anti-
oxidant effects. Although data are lacking to
substantiate the hypothesis that zolpidem
may have exerted a neuroplastic effect by
inhibiting hyper-excitable states caused by
neurotransmitters such as glutamate,
patients with brain injuries23 and with
Parkinson's disease24 have been shown to
benefit from zolpidem in terms of motor
recovery.
Interestingly, the group receiving the
highest dose of zolpidem (4.0 mg/kg)
showed a significant deterioration of behav-
ioural function 14 days weeks after the
stroke. While lower doses of zolpidem have
a neuroplastic effect, higher doses may be
associated with inhibition of the recovery
mechanism. For example, a previous study

Compared with the normal saline (n/s) group, the zolpidem (Zp) 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg groups had
statistically significantly *** (P < 0.005) better improvements in scores over the 14 day period. By contrast, the
group receiving zolpidem (Zp) 4.0 mg/kg had a statistically significant *** (P < 0.005) deterioration in scores
compared with the group receiving normal saline (n/s).

showed that a high dose of zolpidem
(10 mg/kg) impaired the cortical plasticity.17
However, another animal study found that
zolpidem 1.0 mg/kg improved functional
recovery after stroke.25
No differences among groups were
observed in the Day1/Day 14 ratio of
RAM, suggesting that the beneficial effects
of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg zolpidem on behav-
ioural function were not associated with any
memory impairment. Previous studies in
humans assessing the effects of zolpidem
on memory function have produced con-
flicting results.26­28 By contrast with the
current study, these previous studies
included healthy volunteers and evaluated
the immediate effects (i.e., within 24 h) of
zolpidem.
No differences among groups were also
observed in the Day1/Day 14 ratio of
infarction volumes. The lack of effect of
zolpidem on infarction volumes may be
related to the length of the dosing period.
Perhaps a dosing schedule of longer than
two weeks is required to achieve an effect of
zolpidem on the size of the ischemic lesion.
The study had some limitations. For
example, animals were only monitored for
two weeks after the stroke. Further studies,
with an increased follow-up period are
required to confirm the long-term effects of
zolpidem. In addition, only rat models with
middle cerebral artery infarction were used
for the study. Therefore, further studies
using other types of brain injuries, such as
haemorrhage, are required to investigate the
possible neuroprotective action of zolpidem
more fully.
In summary, this study in a rat model
showed that 0.5­1.0 mg/kg of zolpidem had
beneficial effects on behavioural function by
enhancing neural plasticity without causing
any memory impairment in acute ischemic
stroke.
