Abstract
Mounting experimental and epidemiologic evidence supports
the hypothesis that vitamin D reduces the risk of prostate
cancer. Some evidence suggests that prostate cancer risk may
be influenced by sun exposure early in life. We analyzed data
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I
Epidemiologic Follow-up Study to examine associations of
prostate cancer risk with early-life and adult residential sun
exposure and adult sun exposures that were assessed through
self-report, physician report, and dermatologic examination.
We used solar radiation in the state of birth as a measure
of sun exposure in early life. Follow-up from 1971 to 1975
(baseline) to 1992 identified 161 prostate cancer cases (102
nonfatal and 59 fatal) among non-Hispanic white men for
whom sun exposure data were available. Significant inverse
associations were found for men born in a region of high solar
radiation (relative risk, 0.49, 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.90
for high versus low solar radiation), with a slightly greater
reduction for fatal than for nonfatal prostate cancer. Frequent
recreational sun exposure in adulthood was associated with a
significantly reduced risk of fatal prostate cancer only
(relative risk, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.99). These
findings suggest that, in addition to sun exposure in
adulthood, sun exposure in early life protects against prostate
cancer. (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2007;16(6):1283­6)
Introduction
Mounting experimental and epidemiologic evidence supports
the hypothesis that vitamin D reduces the risk of prostate
cancer (1, 2). The major source of vitamin D is casual exposure
to sunlight, which accounts for f90% of serum levels of
25(OH)D, the main circulating metabolite of vitamin D (3). In
the United States, prostate cancer mortality rates are inversely
correlated with solar radiation levels, with the highest rates
found in the Northeast (4, 5). Recently, several studies reported
inverse associations with prostate cancer risk in relation to
residential sun exposure (6), self-reported sun exposure (7), a
sun exposure index based on skin pigmentation measurements
(8), serum levels of 25(OH)D (9, 10), and composite score based
on multiple predictors of serum levels of 25(OH)D (11).
Additionally, high residential sun exposure has been associ-
ated with significantly increased survival (12) and decreased
mortality from prostate cancer (13).
Although data are sparse, some evidence suggests that
prostate cancer risk may be influenced by sun exposure early
in life (6, 7). Most previous studies have focused on the effect
of sun exposure during adulthood, and the effect of sun
exposure in early life has been little explored. We examined
the effect of early-life versus adult sun exposure on prostate
cancer risk in the First National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Follow-up
Study, a nationwide prospective study of men spanning a wide
range of residential sun exposure.
Materials and Methods
Study Population. NHANES I was conducted from 1971 to
1975 in a probability sample of the noninstitutionalized U.S.
population. Adults ages 25 to 74 years, including 5,811 men,
were recontacted for follow-up interviews conducted in 1982
to 1984, 1986 to 1987, and 1992 as part of the NHANES I
Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (14). Baseline data were
obtained through an in-person interview and a dermatologic
examination, including information on residential history and
sun-induced skin damage. The first follow-up interview
conducted in 1982 to 1984 collected information on self-
reported recreational and occupational sun exposure.
Of 5,811 male NHANES I participants, 306 (5.3%) were lost
or declined participation in follow-up. Information on various
health outcomes, including prostate cancer, was collected
through interviews with surviving individuals or proxy
respondents. A total of 249 men were identified who were
diagnosed with or died from prostate cancer during the
follow-up period. Of these, 52 were non-white and were
excluded in this analysis. The remaining 197 white prostate
cancer cases included 73 self-reports only, 32 self-reports
confirmed by hospital records, 48 self-reports confirmed by
death certificates, 19 identified through hospital records only,
and 25 identified through death certificates. Analyses were
based on 161 non-Hispanic white cases and 3,367 non-Hispanic
white noncases for whom information on sun exposure was
available.
Statistical Analysis. We examined prostate cancer risk in
relation to solar radiation in state of birth, as a proxy measure of
early-life sun exposure, and several measures of sun exposure
in adulthood, including solar radiation in the state of longest
residence, and sun exposure assessed by self-report, physician
report, and dermatologic examination. Each U.S. state of
residence was assigned an average solar radiation level as
described elsewhere (15), and solar radiation in each state was
classified as low, medium, or high based on the approximate

tertile distribution. The first follow-up interview in 1982 to
1984 collected information on self-reported recreational and
occupational sun exposure rated as never, rare, occasional, or
frequent. In the dermatologic baseline examination, sun-
induced skin damage was rated as absent, minimal, moderate,
or severe, and physician-assessed sun exposure was rated as
unimpressive, moderate, or considerable. We used Cox
proportional hazard regression modeling to estimate relative
risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), adjusting for
age only, because in a previous analysis of the NHANES I
follow-up data (6), we found no evidence of confounding by
family history of prostate cancer, fat intake, or calcium intake.
Because the influence of vitamin D may be different on early-
stage versus advanced disease, we did analyses for all prostate
cancer cases combined and stratified analyses for nonfatal
and fatal cases. For cases, person-years of follow-up were
estimated from the year (midpoint of June 30) of the NHANES
I interview to the year of prostate cancer incidence, defined as
the year of first hospital admission related to prostate cancer,
the year of the self-reported diagnosis for prostate cancers
without hospital record confirmation, and the year of death
for prostate cancers confirmed by death certificate only. For
men without prostate cancer, the person-years of follow-up
were estimated from the year of the NHANES I interview to
the year of last interview, if alive, or to the year of death, if
deceased.
Results
As reported previously (6), high residential sun exposure was
associated with reduced prostate cancer risk (Table 1). Lower
risks were found among men born in a state of high solar
radiation (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.33-0.81) and among men whose
longest residence was in a state of high solar radiation (RR,
0.59; 95% CI, 0.39-0.88). An inverse association with high early-
life solar radiation remained after adjustment for adult solar
radiation (odds ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27-0.90) and was present
for both nonfatal and fatal prostate cancer. Conversely, the
inverse association with solar radiation at the longest residence
was greatly weakened after adjustment for solar radiation at
birth, and no association remained for nonfatal prostate cancer.
A nonsignificant inverse association was found for fatal
prostate cancer only.
The majority of men born in a particular solar radiation
region (i.e., low, medium, and high) reported the longest
residence in the same solar radiation region. The proportions
were 91%, 80%, and 91% for men born in low, medium, and
high solar radiation regions, respectively. Compared with
men who were born and lived the longest in a low solar
radiation region, those born and with longest residence in
a high solar radiation region had a 48% lower risk (RR, 0.52;
95% CI, 0.32-0.83), and those born and with longest residence
in a medium solar radiation region had an intermediate risk
(RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.46-1.05; data not shown). When we
classified solar radiation at birth and longest residence as
high versus low (above or below the median), we found
stronger associations with residential sun exposure for fatal
than for nonfatal prostate cancer (Table 1). A significant risk
reduction was found for men with fatal prostate cancer with
both early-life and adult residence in a region of high solar
radiation (RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.18-0.66 for high versus low
solar radiation).
Associations with other sun exposure variables in adult
life are shown in Table 2. Frequent recreational sun exposure
was associated with significantly reduced risk of fatal
prostate cancer (RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99). A nonsignificant
reduction in risk also was found for men whose usual sun
exposure was rated as ``considerable'' by study physicians
(RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.32-1.20). Nonfatal prostate cancer was not
associated with physician-assessed or self-reported sun
exposure in adulthood.
Discussion
Among several measures of sun exposure examined in this
prospective study, high residential solar radiation in the state
of birth, a proxy measure for early-life sun exposure, was
associated with reduced prostate cancer risk. Among men born
in a region of high solar radiation, risk was reduced by 51%,
with a slightly greater risk reduction noted for fatal than for
nonfatal prostate cancer. Among men with frequent recrea-
tional sun exposure, risk of fatal prostate cancer was reduced
by 53%. Although limited by small numbers, the influence of
sun exposure seemed stronger on fatal than nonfatal prostate
cancer.
The finding of reduced risk associated with early-life sun
exposure is consistent with results from a case-control study
conducted in England where several indicators of childhood
sun exposure, including sun burns and sunbathing, were
inversely associated with prostate cancer risk (7). However, it

is contrary to our recent report from a California-based case-
control study, in which we did not find an association with
residential solar radiation at birth or before age 20 years for
advanced (8) and localized3 prostate cancer. There are
important differences in the residential histories of the two
populations. In the NHANES I cohort, large proportions
(80-91%) of men remained in the solar radiation region where
they were born, whereas, in the case-control study, all men
eventually moved to California, a state with high solar
radiation, and large proportions of cases (75%) and controls
(75%) spent 40 or more years in a high solar radiation region
before the interview. Unlike the NHANES I follow-up study,
the case-control study did not include any men with lifelong
low residential sun exposure.
Our present findings, showing the importance of early-life
sun exposure, and those from studies of adult sun exposure,
are not necessarily in conflict. For example, because many
case-control studies found a damaging effect of sunburns early
in life on risk of melanoma, it had been widely believed that
susceptibility to melanoma was restricted to a ``critical period''
in early life. However, subsequent studies have shown that
after controlling for sunburns early in life, sunburns during
adulthood also confer increased risk (16). Although based on
small numbers, our findings suggest similarly that the
window of opportunity for sunlight to alter prostate cancer
risk is not restricted to adulthood. Although most epidemio-
logic studies have focused on the role of sunlight/vitamin D
exposure in adulthood, it is biologically plausible that
exposure to vitamin D in early life also may contribute to
reduced risk. In particular, it is known that neonatal prostate
cells express VDR [the receptor for 1,25(OH)2
D, the hormonal
form of vitamin D] and that early-life exposure of rats to high
levels of 1,25(OH)2
D results in alterations in the cellular
composition of the prostate gland (17). For example, whereas
the ratio of epithelial to stromal cells in the normal rodent
prostate is 5:1, prepubertal rats exposed to pharmacologic
doses of 1,25(OH)2
D developed prostate glands that were
composed predominantly of stromal cells (18). Because
epithelial cells are the targets of carcinogenesis in the prostate,
a reduction in the epithelial cell population is one mechanism
whereby exposure to vitamin D in early life could reduce
prostate cancer risk.
Stratification of the analysis by nonfatal and fatal prostate
cancer suggests that recent adult sun exposure may be more
important for fatal than nonfatal prostate cancer. Similarly, in
our California-based case-control study, a sun exposure index
based on skin pigmentation measurements was associated
with reduced risk of advanced (8) but not localized prostate
cancer.3 These findings are consistent with experimental
studies that show that 1,25(OH)2
D inhibits prostate cancer cell
invasion (19) and metastasis (20) and warrant future studies
that distinguish between the effects of sun exposure on early-
stage versus advanced/fatal prostate cancer.
