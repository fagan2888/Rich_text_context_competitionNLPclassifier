Objectives: To examine the spatial patterning of the individuals
with gonorrhea or chlamydia infection in the Calgary Health Region
(CHR) to target prevention and control activities.
Methods: A Geographic Information System was used to map the
prevalence rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia infection in the CHR to
2001 Census Tracts in the CHR. Data from the 2001 Canadian Census
were used to describe the socioeconomic status (SES) of these areas.
Results: Low SES indicators correlated with each other (low me-
dian household income, lower education, single mothers) as did high
SES indicators (married, owning a dwelling, high median income,
university education). A correlation was detected between areas of low
SES and areas of high prevalence rates for gonorrhea and for chla-
mydia. These areas clustered primarily downtown and in the northeast
part of the city.
Conclusions: Nodes and corridors of activity in Calgary were
detected in correlation studies of the 2001 Census variables used. The
core (high prevalence) areas should be the areas targeted for sexually
transmitted infection prevention and control. This can be done at the
community level through measures such as more sexually transmitted
infection clinics operating with longer hours in areas identified from
this mapping.
HISTORICALLY, GONORRHEA HAS been a nationally notifi-
able sexually transmitted infection (STI) in Canada since 1924.
However, genital chlamydia infection is a more recently recog-
nized disease: The Public Health Agency of Canada began national
surveillance in 1990.1 Since treatment for gonorrhea is not effec-
tive against chlamydia, many people treated for gonorrhea had a
concomitant, silent chlamydia infection that remained untreated.2
Canadian guidelines now recommend additional treatment for
chlamydia when the presence of gonorrhea is suspected; however,
chlamydia remains a ubiquitous disease.3
In the Calgary Health Region (CHR), gonorrhea and chlamydia
diagnoses increased after years of decline. Gonorrhea infections
decreased from 51.2 to 15.5 per 100,000 between 1990 and 1995,
and then increased to 19.75 per 100,000 in 2001. Chlamydia
infections decreased from 309.7 to 177.4 per 100,000 between
1990 and 1997 and subsequently increased to 200.84 per 100,000
in 2001.1,4,5
Transmission of an STI is not homogeneous across the popula-
tion; for example, a few individuals are rapidly, frequently, or
heavily infected whereas the majority of the population either
evade infection or suffer infrequent or light infections.6­8 In STI
clinics in Alberta, the highest rates of reportable STIs are found in
the 15- to 24-year-old age group and particularly in women.9
Infections with chlamydia and gonorrhea are often difficult to
diagnose in women since they are frequently asymptomatic.10,11
This results in a higher risk of continued transmission due to such
factors as asymptomatic infections, failure to recognize symptoms
of infection, and failure to seek diagnosis and treatment in a timely
fashion.12 These factors may be influenced by high prevalence or
exposure to prostitution, illicit drug use, low economic and aca-
demic achievement, low utilization or limited access to health care
resources, and related socioeconomic and environmental factors.13
There are 2 main approaches to identifying groups who are at
high risk of acquiring an STI: Identify individuals or identify high
prevalence areas.14 Individuals with repeat infections (within a
12-month period) or who are coinfected with gonorrhea and chla-
mydia have been found to be useful markers for identifying indi-
viduals at high risk of acquiring an STI.15 In general, it is difficult
to identify individuals at high risk since most other characteristics
[such as race, socioeconomic status (SES), or age] are risk markers for
behaviors of subgroups and are stigmatizing to individuals.3,5,13,15,16
In addition, the individuals comprising high-prevalence groups
often do not present to the health care system for testing or for
treatment; hence, they continue to transmit the disease. The other
strategy is to identify key geographic areas where STI transmission
rates are highest through mapping of STI prevalence rates. This
geographic clustering of STI infections probably results from the
existence of localized sexual networks at the neighborhood level.
STI control programs targeting these areas will then theoretically
impact high-prevalence group members.6,10,15
Geographic information systems (GIS) are software tools that
allow for the processing of spatial data for visualization and
exploratory data analysis.14,17 Spatial analysis is the ability to
manipulate spatial data (such as Postal Codes, PCs) into different
forms and extract additional meaning as a result. Layers of data,
such as geographic location, type of STI, and SES variables, can be
entered into a GIS and a map generated to identify statistically
significant clusters of disease.14

The purpose of this article is to use an ecological study design
to describe the geographic distribution of people with reported gon-
orrhea and chlamydia infections, and to identify "high-risk" areas for
targeting resources for STI prevention and control programs.
Methods
The STI study sample includes 3 subgroups of the local general
population residing in the CHR: those patients seen through the
Family Planning Clinic, the STI clinic, and the remainder of
service providers of the CHR. Patients attending the STI clinic are
tested because they may be symptomatic and seeking medical
attention or may be asymptomatic contacts of an index case of STI.
Other patients seen through the Family Planning Clinic or in the
remainder of the health care system (private physicians, walk-in
clinics, and hospital emergency rooms) are primarily tested for STI
because they present with symptoms, are tested for routine STI
screening, or are tested at the patient's request. The STI Services
surveillance database also contains data from any positive diag-
nostic test performed by Calgary Laboratory Services or by the
Provincial Laboratory of Public Health (Microbiology) for south-
ern Alberta.
The study population was extracted from the Alberta Health and
Wellness STI surveillance database and consisted of all individuals
reported as having a diagnosis of gonorrhea between January 1,
1998, and June 21, 2002, or having a diagnosis of chlamydia
between December 23, 1997, and July 8, 2002. Individuals were
included who had a valid PC within the Calgary city limits. Only
those individuals with a diagnosis of chlamydia or gonorrhea were
included: individuals with other STIs such as nongonococcal ure-
thritis were excluded from the study population.
The STI data were imported into the GIS, ArcView 8.1
(ArcGIS, ESRI, Redlands CA). The Statistics Canada Postal Code
Conversion File was used to link the cleaned STI data to geo-
graphic coordinates in order to map the data in the GIS software.
The Postal Code Conversion File is a digital file that provides a
link between the 6 character PC and Statistics Canada's standard
geographical areas for which Census data are produced. It also
provides the x, y (latitude/longitude) coordinates for a point rep-
resenting the approximate location of the PC to support mapping.18
The numbers of cases were then aggregated first at the PC level
and then at the Census Tract level. Rates of chlamydia and gon-
orrhea per 100,000 population were calculated at the Census Tract
level. The STI rates were then converted to core (top 25% of rates),
adjacent (next 25% of the rates), and peripheral (bottom 50% of
the rates) categories and plotted on the map of the CHR, replicat-
ing previous authors' methodology.6,14,15
The core model break points were analyzed spatially to deter-
mine the pattern of core, adjacent, and peripheral areas for chla-
mydia and gonorrhea in the CHR. Spatial analysis was performed
using CrimeStat, a program provided on the Internet by the United
States Department of Justice for "hotspot" analysis of GIS data
(www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/crimestat.html). The program an-
alyzed the distribution of gonorrhea or chlamydia cases by PC
using nearest neighbor hierarchical spatial clustering.
Data from the Canadian 2001 Census were used to estimate
mobility, marital status, presence of detached houses in the Census
Tract, employment rate, university education, lone female parent,
median household income, proportion of population 15 to 40
years, and owning a dwelling for Calgary Census Tracts (Statistics
Canada, Microdata Release File). Pearson's correlation coeffi-
cients were calculated at the Census Tract level to look for eco-
logical associations between the calculated STI rates and the
socioeconomic rates derived from the 2001 Census data. The data
were aggregated such that at least 5 cases of chlamydia or gonor-
rhea occurred for each geographic aggregation to provide stable
rates for comparison and to mask individuals to preserve anonym-
ity.10 The aggregation was performed visually by clustering Cen-
sus Tracts that were spatially close together and considering their
similarity in SES variables from the 2001 Census. The correspond-
ing Census data for the clustered Census Tracts were then likewise
aggregated.
Results
Alberta is a province in Canada with a population of approxi-
mately 3.2 million people. Calgary is the larger of the 2 main
centers in the province, with a population of nearly 1 million. The
2001 Canadian Census shows that Calgary is a young, wealthy,
and well-educated city. The city has experienced the largest pop-
ulation increase of all the large Canadian centers when compared
with the last Census done in 1996 with nearly 16% growth. The
median age of the population is the youngest at 34.9 years, while
median family income at $58,861 is amongst the highest in Canada.
There were a total of 7456 records after the data cleaning was
completed. Mapped cases (5890 of 7456; 78.9%) were linked
through a valid residential PC to geographic coordinates and were
able to be mapped in the GIS. Unmapped cases (1566 of 7456;
21%) could not be linked because a valid PC was not included with
the STI data. These were unmapped because the address given was
for the Calgary STI Clinic or a Post Office box (19.7%) or because
the PC given was incorrect (1.3%).
Overall, the mapped and unmapped cases were similar, indicat-
ing no bias in the mapped populations for chlamydia or gonorrhea.
There were more females in the mapped populations than in the
unmapped populations for both chlamydia and gonorrhea with
69.6% versus 53.9% (P 0.0001) females with chlamydia and
37.1% versus 24.7% (P 0.0016) females with gonorrhea.
Within the mapped population, major differences were seen in
the demographic characteristics of individuals diagnosed with
chlamydia and gonorrhea (Table 1). The chlamydia population was
comprised of younger people (23.6 years vs. 27.9 years) and more
females (69.6%) than the gonorrhea population (37.1%). Differ-

ences in ethnic origin reported were also significant but since a
high proportion of the population did not provide this information,
the data should be viewed with caution.
To describe the sociodemographic characteristics of the Calgary
population, Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated. A
pattern of correlations emerged for the 11 independent variables
chosen from the 2001 Canadian Census data. Areas reporting a
larger population between 15 and 40 years of age also were
positively correlated with a reported move within the past 5 years,
indicating Calgary has a young, mobile population. These same
areas were negatively correlated with having a high median in-
come, being married and owning a home, indicating that this
young population is more likely to be single and rent. A positive
correlation existed between a high median income, being married,
owning a dwelling, and the presence of a high proportion of
detached houses in the geographic area. Areas with a high lone
female parent population also reported lower university atten-
dance.
In the analysis of correlations of SES variables from the 2001
Canadian Census, variables indicating high SES (high median
household income, owning a dwelling, lower housing density,
married) were found to be highly correlated with each other. These
high SES variables occurred in suburban Census Tracts in Calgary.
Similarly, variables indicating lower SES (single mothers, lower
education, high housing density, renters, single marital status)
were also found to be highly correlated with each other. These low
SES variables tended to be located in the downtown and northeast
(NE) quadrant of the city.
Correlations between sociodemographic characteristics and the
chlamydia and gonorrhea rates were found indicating some eco-
logical associations (Table 2). For each a strong positive correlation
exists between STI and a young population (population between 15
and 40 years of age) and the presence of lone single female parent
in the Census Tract. High rates of gonorrhea correlated with areas
that had a higher proportion of males in the Census Tract. Strong
negative correlations were found between the areas with high
chlamydia or gonorrhea rates and high income, being married, the
presence of detached houses, and owning a dwelling.
The core (top 25% of chlamydia and gonorrhea rates), adjacent
(next 25% of the chlamydia and gonorrhea rates), and peripheral
(bottom 50% of the chlamydia and gonorrhea rates) points were
plotted on the map of the CHR. The maps are presented in Figures
1 and 2. Hotspot analysis using the CrimeStat program showed a
significant clustering of PCs with high rates of gonorrhea near the
downtown, whereas there was a significant clustering of PCs with
high rates of chlamydia near the downtown and in the NE quad-
rant. Outlier points with high rates were seen in the suburban areas
for each map.
The Census Tracts with high rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea
infection positively correlate with the low SES variables and
negatively correlate with the high SES variables. Those areas with
top 25% of STI rates (core areas) had the lowest SES while those
areas with bottom 50% of STI rates (peripheral areas) have the
highest SES.
Discussion
There were no significant differences in age between the mapped
and unmapped populations with gonorrhea or chlamydia, and
women were more likely to report a mappable PC than men.
However, the mapped population with chlamydia had more fe-
males and was younger than the mapped gonorrhea population.
One possible explanation is that gonorrhea is often symptomatic in
men and so men may present for gonorrhea testing more frequently
than do women. Additionally, women may be screened for chla-
mydia more frequently than men are since there are often oppor-
tunities for screening (such as pregnancy and PAP smear testing)
that do not occur for men. Men who have sex with men is an
important population for gonorrhea,13 but was not a 2001 Census
variable and was not investigated in this study. Other studies have
shown no significant differences in the ages of their study popu-
lations with chlamydia and with gonorrhea,19,20 but this may be an
artefact of the chosen study populations in those centers, such as
only specialty STI clinic patients, rather than the population-based
sample for this study.
The significant SES variables were not fundamentally different
for the chlamydia and gonorrhea positive populations (Table 2).
Jolly et al. have shown differences between these populations,
perhaps indicating multiple reservoirs of infection.21 Further in-
vestigations using a qualitative study design may be needed to
determine if Calgary's core members have stronger network con-
nections than was seen in other centers and whether the similarities
were the result of exposure to a single reservoir of infection
present in the CHR.
Census Tracts with a high prevalence of chlamydia and gonor-
rhea (core areas) were associated with low SES. Individuals in the
populations from these core areas were more likely to be male,
single, have low income, and be less educated than those from the
peripheral area populations. Frohlich found a similar association
between low SES variables and other socially unacceptable behav-
iors in Quebec.22 In addition to being a marker of low SES, living
in single-parent families has also been associated with earlier onset
of sexual activity, which is another risk factor for STIs.23 Although
these associations are ecological, the core area pattern of high
density housing and low SES has been widely reported in the
literature.1,13,15,24,25 Low SES may be associated with an ecolog-
ical risk of exposure to STIs that is independent of individual risk
behavior.21
Spatial analysis of the maps of chlamydia and gonorrhea prev-
alence rates showed that the core (high prevalence) areas clustered
in the downtown core and NE section of the city (Figs. 1 and 2).
The adjacent (intermediate prevalence) rates were geographically
closer to the core areas whereas the peripheral (low prevalence)
rates primarily appeared in the suburban Census Tracts. There
were some outlier core (high prevalence) areas seen in suburban
Census Tracts in the south and Northwest sections of the city. This
may be a result of mapping the residential PCs of people with

CHLAMYDIA AND GONORRHEA INFECTIONS IN CALGARY
reported gonorrhea and chlamydia infection and may not reflect
the areas in the CHR where infection was actually acquired.
The pattern of core (high-prevalence) areas for STIs follows the
pattern of low SES areas within the CHR. The finding of the pre-
dominant core (high-prevalence) areas occurring in areas of the
CHR with lower SES Census Tracts seems intuitive since it is well
known in the literature.13,15,25­27 The core model showing patterns
of high-prevalence STI areas is supported by the Calgary data
where several core (high prevalence STI) areas were detected.
Blanchard et al.15 detected core (high-prevalence), adjacent (inter-
mediate prevalence), and peripheral (low prevalence) areas in
Winnipeg based on average annual incidence rates for gonorrhea
and chlamydia. They found that the 4 PCs in the downtown that
comprised the core areas for gonorrhea and for chlamydia over-
lapped. The Winnipeg core (high-prevalence) area had high pop-
ulation density with greater mobility, higher unemployment rates,
lower mean household incomes, and a higher proportion of male
residents than the peripheral areas. Becker et al.6 repeated this
study in Baltimore and found the core area covered a larger
proportion of the city than in Winnipeg and clustered in 2 primary
areas. In these studies and the CHR study, the adjacent (lower-
prevalence) areas were found at the edge of the core areas and the
peripheral (low-prevalence) areas were outside of the adjacent areas.
STI prevention and control activities typically target decreasing
the number of new sexual partners and exposed individuals (e.g.,
through increased condom usage), and decreasing the duration of
disease through effective diagnosis and treatment of STIs.27,28 To
date, provision of diagnostic services and educating at-risk popu-
lations have been key control strategies for both chlamydia and
gonorrhea.28 The core model of STI transmission suggests that
directing efforts towards members of a core (high-prevalence STI)
group yields the largest decrease in STI rates. However, commu-

nity-based interventions can help to change community social
norms and are more effective than trying to change individual
behavior since it is difficult for an individual to step out of line
with their peers.29,30 This study identified those high prevalence
communities (downtown and NE) where focused interventions
must be directed if the prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea in
the CHR is to decrease.
STIs are spread through an interconnected networks of sexual
partnerships that are strongly influenced by social and geographic
factors.31,32 The geographic clustering of STI prevalence rates
found in this study probably results from the existence of localized
sexual networks at the neighborhood level.15 Geographic ap-
proaches to STI prevention in areas where core groups have
been found to cluster have been advocated as a viable alterna-
tive to case-by-case contact tracing and have shown success in
lowering disease incidence.33 However, this geographic ap-
proach of targeting the high-prevalence areas could miss certain
individuals in a sexual network who then can reintroduce in-
fection into the core group.31 In any sexual network, the risk of
STI depends both on individual behaviors and the environmen-
tal risk, such as the infection status and behaviors of people in
the sexual network with whom the individual interacts.34 The
magnitude of risk for infection with an STI depends on the
prevalence of STI in that population: there is no risk of STI
transmission between 2 individuals with risky sexual behavior
if they are both disease free.23,31,34 A possible intervention to
address both the individual and environmental risk factors for trans-
mission of STIs is an enhanced education program in the school
system that addresses both individual characteristics (enhanced self-
esteem and better decision-making skills for younger age groups) and
group characteristics such as knowledge about STIs and prevention
activities (e.g., condom usage).

CHLAMYDIA AND GONORRHEA INFECTIONS IN CALGARY
This study relied on an objective data source for STI informa-
tion and did not rely on self-reporting, which is notorious for errors
in reporting of socially sensitive diseases. The cases were reported
as part of Alberta's legislated public health reporting requirements
from the entire CHR by physicians and laboratories. Completeness
of the data are critical to ensure that case detection is representa-
tive of the population at large.35 Quartiles of the rates were used to
provide an objective definition for the core (high prevalence),
adjacent (intermediate), and peripheral (low) areas. Other re-
searchers have used subjective, visual aggregations of the STI
prevalence rates but this may not be reproducible in all settings.15
This study was an important first step to establish a baseline of the
spatial pattern of gonorrhea and chlamydia in the CHR. STI
surveillance activities can be supplemented by repeating the study
to determine if there has been a change in the geographic pattern
of chlamydia and gonorrhea over time. This study is a valuable
addition to what was known by the CHR and by Alberta Health
and Wellness about the status of STI infections in Alberta's largest
urban centre. This study also added valuable information to help
guide program delivery and the allocation of resources in the core
geographic areas of high chlamydia and gonorrhea prevalence for
prevention and control of STIs in the CHR.
The rates found in this study, although high in some areas, were
underestimates of the true rates. The STI services database con-
tains only detected cases; therefore, asymptomatic and undetected
cases are not represented. Unmapped cases were not included in
the numerator, and so there was an underestimate of the number of
STI cases. Underreporting by physicians in areas of high SES has
been estimated at 30% to 50%, suggesting that the true rates were
higher than reported11,34 and rendered the core (high prevalence) area
rates and low SES association weaker. The denominator used for rate
calculations was the whole population of each CT. It can be argued
that a smaller population of those most likely to be sexually active
with multiple partners (i.e., the 15­39 years of age population) should
be used to more closely approximate the true STI prevalence rate.6
This study design involved mapping the individuals' residential
PC. This location was not necessarily where sexual activity had
taken place. This may account for some of the high-prevalence
(core) rates that were visible outside the main clusters. Addition-
ally, if all the unmapped cases resided in the same areas, this
would have skewed the locations of the core (high-prevalence) rate
points. Geocoding was performed using the Postal Code Conver-
sion File and then rates were aggregated to the Census Tract level,
which reduced potential error in the true geospatial location of
individual PCs.36 Although rate stabilization in small geographic
areas in public health research is an issue,37 the choice of aggre-
gation to 5 cases was primarily to preserve individual's anonymity
in Census Tracts where there were fewer than 5 cases.
Medical geography serves to increase consciousness about the
community and environment as determinants of health.38 In this
study, the community may be a marker of other characteristics that
place people at high risk of acquiring and transmitting STIs, such
as low SES, low education, close proximity to geographic core
(high prevalence) areas, and an increased likelihood of selecting a
core group member as a sexual partner.
