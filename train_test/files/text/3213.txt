Research Question
While Basel III core capital ratio requires common equity, additional capital buffers may
include convertible debt. Contingent convertible capital (CoCos) is a debt instrument that
converts into equity or is partially or fully written off when bank's core tier 1 capital falls
below some trigger level. A key question among regulators is whether CoCos attenuate
incentives for risk-taking in the same way as equity. While there are specific requirements for
CoCos to qualify as an extra buffer, banks are still free to choose the conversion mechanism:
conversion to equity or principal write-down. Our paper studies whether CoCos reduce banks'
willingness to take risk and also which conversion mechanism is most effective in curbing risk-
taking.
Contribution
The paper focuses on how contractual features of CoCos affect a bank's incentives to take
inefficient risk by choosing a speculative asset purely for risk-shifting reasons. We assume
that CoCos are issued to substitute a part of deposits when an increase in bank equity is
not an option. In the model, conversion of CoCos has a preventive function as it occurs in a
timely fashion when risk choices can still be influenced. We show that going-concern CoCos
reduce risk-taking as they force deleveraging.
Results
A key result is that CoCos are better at reducing ex ante risk than bail-in debt. Going-
concern conversion in high leverage states reduces risk-shifting, while bail-in debt only re-
allocates losses at default among debtholders. The main reason for the endogenous risk
reduction comes from the leverage decrease upon conversion. Unlike principal write-down
CoCos, converted-to-equity CoCos result in the dilution of current equity holders upon a
going concern conversion. Such equity dilution does not reduce inefficient risk-taking but
actually increases it. Our results suggest that principal write-down CoCos should be pre-
ferred, since they ensure no equity dilution which has a positive effect on risk incentives.
The effectiveness of CoCos in reducing risk-taking critically depends on the precision of the
trigger. Equity is equivalent to the conversion at all times and therefore induces safer choices.
This suggests that CoCos are not a substitute for equity, and in fact inferior in their ability
to reduce risk.

Convertible Bonds and Bank Risk-Taking

Abstract
We study how contingent capital affects banks' risk choices. When triggered in highly
levered states, going-concern conversion reduces risk-taking incentives, unlike conver-
sion at default by traditional bail-inable debt. Interestingly, contingent capital (CoCo)
may be less risky than bail-inable debt as its lower priority is compensated by a lower
induced risk. The main beneficial effect on risk incentives comes from reduced leverage
upon conversion, while any equity dilution has the opposite effect. This is in contrast
to traditional convertible debt, since CoCo bondholders have a short option position.
As a result, principal write-down CoCo debt is most desirable for risk preventive pur-
poses, although the effect may be tempered by a higher yield. The risk reduction effect
of CoCo debt depends critically on the informativeness of the trigger. As it should
ensure deleveraging in all states with high risk incentives, it is always inferior to pure
equity.

1 Introduction
During the recent credit boom, bank capital had fallen at historical lows. In the ensuing
crisis, banks could not absorb losses, leading to credit market disruption and spillovers
to the real economy. The regulatory response has focused on higher core bank equity to
absorb losses and protect depositors. While Basel III core capital ratios require common
equity, additional buffers (required for instance for SIFIs, systematically important financial
institutions) may include bail-inable and convertible debt. Issuance of bank convertible debt
has risen rapidly to over 200 billion dollar in the last five years.
Originally proposed by Flannery (2002) and discussed extensively by Kashyap, Rajan,
and Stein (2008), contingent convertible capital (henceforth CoCo debt) is a debt claim that
converts into equity or is partially written off when bank capital falls below some trigger
level. Contingent deleveraging creates a buffer that reduces financial distress and deposit
insurance losses (Pennacchi, 2011; Pennacchi, Vermaelen, and Wolff, 2014; Albul, Jaffee,
and Tchistyi, 2013; McDonald, 2013). A key question is whether CoCo debt shares with
common equity the effect of increasing "skin in the game", attenuating incentives for risk-
taking. The view is endorsed by many authors (Madan and Schoutens, 2011; Glasserman
and Nouri, 2012; Koziol and Lawrenz, 2012; Albul et al., 2013; Hilscher and Raviv, 2014;
Berg and Kaserer, 2015; Chan and van Wijnbergen, 2016), though this conclusion follows
only as a comparative statics exercise on the sensitivity of equity value to exogenous changes
in asset risk.1
The paper focuses on how contractual features of CoCo debt affect a bank's incentives
to take inefficient risk that involves a choice for speculative assets purely for risk shifting
reasons, as they would not be chosen by an unlevered investors. To our knowledge, this is
the first treatment of banks' endogenous asset risk choice in response to CoCo debt.2
While equity would naturally offer the lowest risk incentives, our starting point presumes
that CoCos are issued because an increase in bank equity is not an option.3 We show that
going-concern CoCo capital reduces risk-taking as it forces deleveraging in highly levered
states, when risk-shifting incentives are strongest.
Our structural analysis reveals some surprising effects of CoCo debt's contractual fea-
tures.4 A key result is that CoCo debt can be shown to be better at reducing ex ante risk
than conventional bail-inable debt. Going-concern conversion in high leverage states reduces
risk-shifting, while debt bail-in only reallocates losses at default among debtors. As it does
not affect shareholder payoffs, it does not alter their ex ante risk incentives.
The main contribution to endogenous risk reduction turns out to be the direct effect
of leverage reduction upon conversion. In contrast, equity dilution caused upon a going
concern conversion does not reduce inefficient risk-taking but actually enhances it. This
is in contrast with the result on risk incentives under conventional convertible debt Green
(1984). The insight is that traditional convertible bondholders have a long option position
1Partial exceptions are Chen, Glasserman, Nouri, and Pelger (2017), where equityholders may choose for
strategic default when insolvent, and Chan and van Wijnbergen (2016) who study a bank's trade-off between
probability of conversion and bankruptcy cost.
2We offer an overview of the main assumptions and results in the literature in the Appendix.
3Distinct benefits of CoCos versus equity are its lower after-tax cost and better incentives for effort under
a managerial agency conflict (Kashyap et al., 2008).
4Consistently with a scarcity of bank equity, the trigger on CoCo debt is set so as to avoid conversion in
states when it does not contribute to reducing risk-taking.

and convert only in a favorable outcome, diluting high returns from riskier choices. Instead,
CoCo debt automatically turns into equity when asset values are revealed to be low.5 Equity
dilution upon conversion has a counterproductive effect because it reduces the share of value
accruing to shareholders of a safer asset choice. Thus a main conclusion is that CoCo debt
reduces risk-taking via its debt reduction effect, not through its equity dilution. A separate
debt reduction effect arises because a fixed conversion ratio implies a value transfer from
CoCo holders to equityholders, which we term CoCo dilution (Berg and Kaserer, 2015).6
In practice, such a value transfer to equity occurs in all existing CoCo debt issues, as it is
impossible to fully adjust the conversion by a contingent conversion ratio (in some states
even an infinite dilution would be insufficient). The CoCo dilution has the effect of reducing
equity dilution and thus also banks' risk-shifting incentives. In the extreme case of principal
write down CoCo debt, the equity dilution effect is minimized to zero.
A final consideration is that as CoCo debt has on average a lower priority than other forms
of debt it may be expected to command a higher yield, which increases effective leverage and
thus risk incentives. However, as CoCo bonds induce less risky choices they may be safer in
equilibrium, in which case they would carry a lower yield.
We next compare the two main forms of CoCo debt conversion, namely conversion to
equity versus principal write-down. Our results suggest that a debt write-off upon conver-
sion should be preferred, since debt dilution has a favorable effect and equity dilution has
a negative effect on risk incentives. In general however write-down CoCo debt may have a
higher yield if it suffers larger loss at conversion. A higher yield worsens risk choice, an effect
that must be traded off against the balance of the equity and CoCo dilution effects.7 Numer-
ical calibrations suggest that although converted to equity CoCos are more expensive than
principal write-down CoCos, the risk reduction effect of the latter is usually stronger. The
intuition is that a contingent conversion reduces endogenous risk sufficiently to compensate
for their larger risk bearing.
The effectiveness of CoCo conversion on risk incentives critically depends on the precision
of the trigger, and specifically how frequently it delivers deleveraging in states when risk-
shifting incentives have deteriorated. Equity is equivalent to conversion in all states and
therefore always ensures safer choice. A final conclusion is that CoCo debt will fail to
control risk in the most levered banks, for which there is a clear role for direct regulatory
intervention.
1.1 Model discussion and related literature
Our setup offers a limited welfare analysis. We take initial capital requirements and deposit
insurance as given. Following the literature, insured deposits are assumed to be the cheapest
form of funding as deposit insurance is not properly priced. 8. We also do not seek to explain
5In the model, conversion has a preventive function as it occurs in a timely fashion when risk choices can
still be influenced. A delayed conversion just before default would clearly not influence incentives.
6Berg and Kaserer (2015) study how CoCo debt dilution affects equity valuation near the trigger to assess
the effect of any value transfer to and from CoCo debt.
7It is easy to see that if the yield were the same for both types, a principal write-down version always
induces a safer choice.
8Deposit insurance charges would ceteris paribus increase effective leverage. While the low cost of deposits
has a positive effect on risk incentives, we do not advocate subsidizing bank liability risk. Sundaresan and
Wang (2014) show how even fairly priced insurance will induce banks to take excess risk.

the amount of CoCo issued (although our calibration model may be used to optimize the
tradeoff between a higher equity content and a higher yield). Rather than introducing
an arbitrary rationale for the choice of CoCo debt versus equity, we implicitly presume that
there is a scarcity of equity investors or an unsurmountable reluctance by banks to issue more
equity. Accordingly, in the model the trigger level is set to economize on equity content by
avoiding any CoCo conversion for banks for which it would not improve risk incentives. This
choice could be rationalized in a setting with an increasing cost of risk absorption capacity
and a regulatory goal to minimize the frequency of bank default, a framework we plan to
adopt in future work.
In our basic model CoCos act as a junior debt upon default at maturity rather to convert
in equity. This feature turns out to be desirable as it reduces risk incentives by avoiding
a transfer to old shareholders in near-default states. In an extension we consider a more
conventional CoCo conversion into equity upon default. In this case a riskier asset choice
at the interim date increases the chance of conversion (as it is the case with other models
where conversion may occur in continuous time).
Gone-concern conversion is shown to induce riskier choice for some banks that were pre-
viously playing safe (since it increases the chance of a value transfer from CoCo debtholders),
while some highly levered banks may now be safer precisely to ensure a value transfer. We
show that on average the proper trigger value should be set higher.
In line with the literature, the trigger is based on an observable value of bank assets. All
outstanding CoCo issues are designed to be triggered by accounting value triggers, which
implies that they may convert only at discrete intervals, as in our model. Regulators have not
encouraged continuous time triggers based on market prices, as they may be manipulable
and cause multiple pricing equilibria (Sundaresan and Wang, 2015), a finding challenged
by Pennacchi and Tchistyi (2016). In practice both market and accounting measures are
imprecise and manipulable. Other approaches to conversion are offered in Duffie (2010) and
McDonald (2013), where the case of conversion in a systemic crisis is examined. Glasserman
and Nouri (2012) study the interesting theoretical case of a continuous conversion feature.
Chan and van Wijnbergen (2014) highlight a possible systemic effect of CoCo conversion, as
it may trigger runs when asset risk is correlated across banks.
In our set up (as in all outstanding CoCo debt), conversion never results in a positive
value transfer to CoCo holders. Hilscher and Raviv (2014) argue that a very high equity
dilution rate at conversion may discourage risk-taking. In practice, converting debt into
shares at below book value faces serious legal issues, and is impossible in states when net
equity is negative.
Our approach has implications for pricing of contingent capital. CoCos are usually priced
as a package of conventional bonds and a short position in a put option. This leads to
underpricing as it neglects their risk-reducing effect, which reduces the value of their short
option position.
There is still limited empirical work on CoCo pricing and their effect on bank risk.
An issuance of CoCo debt should reduce the overall chance of bank default. Interestingly,
Avdjiev, Bolton, Jiang, Kartasheva, and Bogdanova (2017) show that the market impact of
a bank issuing CoCo debt is a lower CDS spread, but has no effect on share returns. This
combination of results suggests that issuing CoCo not only absorbs risk but is also associated
with lower expected asset risk.9 The introduction of CoCo debt may also be beneficial by
9Avdjiev et al. (2017) suggest that current CoCo prices do not properly reflect losses at conversion,
3
inducing voluntary equity recapitalization to avoid costly dilution of profits or loss of control,
as shown in Pennacchi et al. (2014) and Calomiris and Herring (2013).
Section 2 presents the basic setup, and Section 3 shows how CoCo design affects the
banker's risk choice. Section 4 prices different contractual forms and compares the yield
among bail-inable debt, principal write-down CoCos and converted to equity CoCos and
compares their effect on risk choice under endogenous yield. Section 5 considers CoCos
that may convert at maturity and compares their risk reduction effect with those that act
at maturity as a junior debt. Section 6 compares the bank risk choice under CoCo versus
equity funding. Section 7 concludes. The Appendix contains all the proofs as well as an
overview of the main assumptions and results in the literature.
2 Model Setup
All agents are risk-neutral. There are three dates: t = 0, t = 1 (interim date) and t = 2.
The bank has initial assets of value 1 at t = 0, financed with 1 - D of equity that satisfies
an exogenous capital requirements. Bank debt D may include CoCo bonds with face value
C and insured deposits D - C.10 The interim CoCo coupon rate, the deposit rate and the
deposit insurance premia are normalized to zero. CoCo debtholders are competitive, so they
break-even in expectation. There is one active agent in the model: the banker/bank owner,
who chooses the interim level of credit risk.11 The banker's payoff is the value of the original
bank equity at t = 2. Borrowers are price-takers.
At t = 1, the asset value v is uniformly distributed over [1 - , 1 + ], so interim leverage
is D
v
. This is initially observed only by the banker, who then chooses whether to exert risk
control effort (e = 1) or not (e = 0). Effort is costless.
Depending on the banker's choice, asset values at t = 2 may be safe or risky. If the
banker exercises risk control, assets produce a safe payoff with gross return 1, and the final
asset value is v. Alternatively, a risky credit strategy has payoff V2
= v - z + Z, where
Z has zero mean and variance 1. Thus, the mean of the final asset value is E(V2
) = v - z,
and the standard deviation is , distribution function is F(V2
) and density function is f(V2
).
Critically, we assume z > 0, so the riskier strategy is a dominated asset that yields less
on average than the safer asset.12 However, when debt exceeds asset values, a risky choice
would enhance equity value.
After the risk choice is made at t = 1, the value v is revealed with probability  to all
investors. (Note that  measures the precision of public information.) We assume that no
bank equity may be raised at this time. This signal is verifiable and may be used as a trigger
for conversion. CoCos are automatically converted into equity when the interim asset value
v is revealed to have fallen below a pre-specified trigger level vT
at t = 1. The trigger value
is initially set lower than the initial book value 1, else there would be immediate conversion
at t = 0. As we study going-concern conversion, we assume that at t = 1 the value of equity
is positive upon conversion of CoCo debt, so v  D - C for any v. After conversion, the
represented in our setting by the CoCo dilution effect.
10We assume that it is mandatory for the bank to issue CoCos.
11We assume the bank manager is the sole equityholder, to focus on risk-taking rather than on other
agency conflicts between managers and equityholders.
12As a result, the distribution of asset return in the safe outcome has second-order dominance relative to
risky outcome, though not first-order dominance.

amount of shares is 1+d, where d is the amount of shares CoCo holders get upon conversion,
equal to the ratio of face value of CoCos over the trigger asset value minus debt: d = C
vT -D
.
This conversion ratio ensures no value transfer when asset value equals exactly vT
, but leads
to a transfer from CoCo holders as soon as v is strictly below vT
which we refer to as CoCo
dilution.13
At t = 2, CoCos repay C(1 + y), where y is initially exogenous (we endogenize the yield
in Section 4). To highlight the pure effect of going concern conversion, we assume that at
t = 2 CoCos act as traditional junior debt, senior to equity.14
The current payoff structure is presented in the Figure 1. The trigger value vT
is set by
Figure 1: Payoffs in case of no conversion vs early conversion (d < 1)
a regulator whose objective is to minimize ex ante risk (i.e. the probability that the banker
chooses the inefficient risky strategy), while avoiding unnecessary conversions.
The sequence of events is presented in Figure 2.
3 Bank Debt Design and Risk-Shifting Incentives
The banker makes her risk decision to maximize her expected payoff upon observing v. Her
risk shifting incentives can be characterized in terms of the range of values for which risk
control is chosen. Under our assumption of going concern conversion v  D - C, when risk
is controlled depositors are always repaid from bank assets, even in default. In contrast,
if the banker chooses the risky asset, losses may fully wipe out CoCo debt and force some
losses on the deposit insurance fund.
3.1 Baseline Case: Deposits
Consider the baseline case when instead of CoCo debt of amount C bank holds deposits, and
thus all debt D is represented only by deposits. We follow the literature in assuming that
13Conversion at par via a contingent conversion ratio is possible only over some range, but in low states
even a conversion in an infinite amount of shares would not be sufficient. Full equity dilution ahead of default
would in any case be illegal.
14In Section 5 we consider CoCos that can convert into equity at maturity.

deposit insurance not properly priced, so that deposit funding is the cheapest form of debt.
The expected banker's payoff from a risky asset choice is:
(1 - F(D|v)) · E(V2
- D|V2
> D, v) =

D
(V2
- D)f(V2
|v)dV2
(1)
which is the sum of its unconditional mean E(V2

= v - z - D -

(V2
- D)f(V2
|v)dV2
= v - z - D + (v, D, ) (2)
where (v, D, ) is the value of the put option (commonly called Merton's put) enjoyed by
bank equityholders under limited liability. It measures the temptation of the banker to shift
risk, defined as the difference in her payoff between a risky and safe strategy:
(1 - F(D|v)) · E(V2
- D|V2
> D, v) - (v - D) = -z + (v, D, ) (3)
We henceforth refer to (v) as the measure of risk-shifting incentives.
Lemma 1. If the risky asset payoff is normally or uniformly distributed, risk-shifting in-
centives (v) are monotonically decreasing and convex in asset value v: -1   (v) 
0,  (v)  0. Moreover, risk-shifting incentives increase with a higher volatility of risky
asset .
Thus, for a normal distribution, risk-shifting incentives are given by:
(v) = (v - D - z) · 
v - D - z

- 1 +  · 
v - D - z

(4)
We assume that f(V2
) is such that the risk-shifting incentive function is convex in asset
value.
Assumption 1. Risk-shifting incentives (v) are decreasing and convex function of asset
6
value v: -1   (v)  0,  (v)  0. Also (v) are increasing with :  ()  0.
Figure 3: Risk-shifting incentives under Gaussian risk distribution
Now consider the risk choice of the banker when bank's debt is represented only by
deposits. The banker's program is:
max
e
e · max (v - D, 0)
equity value if e = 1
+(1 - e) · (v - z - D + (v))
equity value if e = 0
s.t. e  {0, 1} (5)
At (v) = z the net present value of the banker's choice of a risky lending strategy is
zero. Under the Assumption 1, the banker's choice is:
e =
1 if v  max [-1(z), D]  v
D
0 otherwise
(6)
where v
D
is the cut-off interim asset value.
Lemma 2. Under deposit funding, the banker controls risk if interim leverage is sufficiently
low, namely if v  v
D
 max [-1(z), D]. If -1(z) > D, threshold v
D
rises and the ex ante
probability of risk control (defined as 1+-v
D
2
) decreases with the volatility of risky asset .
We now use the threshold v
D
as a measure of risk prevention against which different
forms of bank debt may be compared.
3.2 Bail-inable debt
In our setting CoCo debt resembles bail-inable debt at maturity date t = 2 unless it converts
at t = 1. To establish the effect of the convertibility feature, we first derive the benchmark
case of pure bail-inable debt.
Consider that instead of CoCo debt of amount C bank holds bail-inable debt, promising
a yield Cy at t = 2. As it is never converted, it is equivalent to CoCo debt when conversion
is never triggered (such as when there is never an informative signal  = 0).
7
Then the banker's program is:
max
e
e · max (v - D - Cy, 0) + (1 - e) · (v - z - D - Cy + (v - Cy))
s.t. e  {0, 1} (7)
where (v - Cy) = - D+Cy
-
(V2
- D - Cy)f(V2
|v)dV2
is its risk-shifting incentive under
bail-inable debt.
The optimal risk choice by the banker is to control risk if v  v
D
+ Cy  v
B
.
Proposition 1. (Yield effect) Under bail-inable debt funding, the banker controls risk less
often than under deposits, since v  v
B
 v
D
+ Cy. The frequency of risk control 1+-v
B
2
declines with yield y and the amount of bail-inable debt C.
This result simply reflects the lower effective leverage associated to deposits because of
their lower yield, which is solely due to deposit insurance. The resulting higher leverage
leads to worse risk control. This yield effect is shown in Figure 4 as the difference between
v
B
and v
D
.
Figure 4: Risk choice under bail-inable debt
Note that in both cases of deposit or bail-inable debt, an interim revelation of v has no
effect on risk choice, as this disclosure does not change leverage.15
3.3 CoCo Debt
This section considers the case of an amount C of CoCo debt, triggered by a public signal
with precision . An efficient design of CoCo debt requires that a trigger improves banker's
risk control decision. Intuitively, conversion should be triggered when bank's interim leverage
is high enough. We set the trigger such that no conversion occurs for well-capitalized banks
which have low risk incentives. This choice trades-off the frequency of risk control against
an increasing marginal cost of risk absorbing capital.
3.3.1 Trigger value
We first consider the banker's risk control decision under a given trigger vT
, and use the
result to define the proper trigger level.
From Proposition 1, setting a trigger higher than v

is the interval satisfying vT
< 1 to ensure no conversion at t = 0. Upon conversion, CoCo
holders get the amount of shares d = C
vT -D
, which we refer to as conversion ratio. CoCo
conversion dilutes shareholders' payoff to 1
d+1
share of equity. Further we show that equity
dilution induces riskier choices as it reduces the value the shareholders get under safe strategy.
Such a conversion ratio also ensures CoCo debt dilution, i.e upon conversion holders of CoCo
debt get less than its face value. CoCo dilution enhances safer choice since it has the opposite
effect than equity dilution by increasing shareholders' stake.
Consider the banker's program:

is risk-
shifting incentive under CoCos conversion.
This identifies two critical interim asset values. First, v
B
is the value threshold at which
the banker chooses for risk control even if no conversion may take place, equivalent to the
threshold for bail-inable debt. Second, v
C
is the risk control threshold for CoCo debt. This
value depends on whether the critical asset value v
C
is above the threshold D +Cy, in which
case bank equity is positive even without conversion:

G =  · z-[v+C]

Proposition 2. The introduction of CoCos improves risk control choice for banks relative to
traditional bail-inable debt in the range of asset values v
C
 v  vT
. Banks with extremely
high leverage (v < v
C
) still choose to take risk, while high value banks (v > v
B
) choose to
control risk.
Banks with v < v
C
have such high leverage that they choose to gamble and not control
risk.16 Figure 5 shows how the risk control choice of the banker depends on the trigger, and

< 1 - ), this range does not arise, and all banks with v < vT

in particular how it may not be monotonic in the interim asset value.

measures the expected improvement in risk control induced by
CoCos. It is easy to see that v
C
is in the range [v

] and decreases with the probability
of information revelation  (see Figure 6).
Figure 6: Cut-off value v

Lemma 3. CoCo debt improves bank's risk control more as the trigger precision  goes up.
The intuition is that a more informative trigger forces more frequently a recapitalization
in states with high risk-shifting incentives.
Having characterized the banker's risk control choice under a given trigger, we can identify
the trigger level, which ensures the monotonicity of risk control choice. Setting the trigger
value at vT
= v
B
ensures monotonicity of risk control choice and thus produces expected risk
reduction (1+-v
C
)
2
for a given amount of CoCo debt C (and thus a given conversion ratio d).
Figure 5 shows that unless the trigger vT
is chosen properly, the risk control choice is
not necessarily monotonic in v. If the trigger is too high (above v
B
), CoCos will not affect
risk choice of low levered banks with v > v
B
. If it is too low (below v
B
), there will be no
conversion for an intermediate range of highly levered banks. This is clearly inefficient, as
it is easier to induce risk control for higher v. As a result, setting the trigger to vT
= v
B
guarantees the monotonicity of risk control with respect to asset value, as shown in Figure
7.
Lemma 4. Under the trigger vT
= v
B
, CoCos induce safer choice than bail-inable debt.
Under the monotonic trigger, the risk control improvement under CoCos against bail-
inable debt ranges from 0 (if v
C
= v
B
) to v
B
-(v
D
-C)
2
(if v
C
= v
D
- C). Therefore, CoCos
ensure better risk control than bail-inable debt. However, CoCo debt does not generally
improve risk control relative to insured deposit funding whose yield is subsidized.
10
Figure 7: Risk choice under CoCos with restricted trigger asset value vT
= v
B
Lemma 5. A higher amount of CoCo debt C or a higher yield y require that the trigger
value be raised to maintain the monotonicity of risk control choice.
As in the case of bail-inable debt, a higher promised yield at maturity Cy increases
leverage and thus willingness to take risk. A higher trigger value vT
= v
B
here is needed to
offset this effect subsidized by increasing the CoCo's equity content. However, it also leads
to more frequent conversion and more risk bearing for CoCo debtholders. The next section
endogenizes the yield for a general characterization.
The trigger value should be set higher when the risky asset choice is more volatile. A
higher asset volatility increases the return to risk-shifting when (D) > z.
Having mapped the banker's risk control decision under a properly set trigger, we turn
to decompose the effect of different CoCo debt features on bank's risk choice.
3.4 Forms of CoCo debt
3.4.1 Write-down CoCos
First we consider the extreme case when conversion leads to a full write-down of principal.
When triggered, this type of CoCo debt "disappears". This is equivalent to the case of a
zero conversion ratio d = 0.
When write-down CoCos convert, the bank has suddenly less leverage while shareholders
keep all shares. This is an extreme form of CoCo dilution. The banker's program is similar
to (8) under d = 0. As before, there is a critical value v
WD
for the interim asset value above
which the introduction of write-down CoCos improves risk control (see Figure 8).
Proposition 3 (Debt reduction effect). Under write-down CoCos with conversion ratio d = 0,
the banker controls risk if v  v
WD
. This improves risk control relative to converted to equity
CoCo debt, since the cut-off value v
WD
is lower than v
C
.
Intuitively, when conversion lowers bank leverage, risk incentives are reduced. The risk
reduction relative to bail-inable debt represents a pure debt reduction effect represented as
v
B
-v
W D
2
in Figure 8.
11
Figure 8: Risk choice under write-down CoCos. Debt reduction effect.
3.4.2 Equity conversion CoCos
Next we establish the benchmark of CoCos converted at par, and then discuss more realistic
case of CoCos with the fixed conversion ratio.
Conversion at par
We briefly consider the possibility that the CoCo conversion ratio could be set such that
no value transfer would occur upon conversion, i.e d = C
v-D
. In other words, the CoCo bond
payoff upon conversion is exactly equal to its face value C. This feature is impossible in
practice for very low v, but it is considered here as it sets a useful benchmark.
The banker's program and its solution are equivalent to (8) as well as (9) and (10)
respectively under d = C
v-D
. There is a critical value v
P
, the interim asset value above which
the introduction of at par CoCos improves risk control.
Proposition 4 (Equity dilution effect). Under CoCos converted at par with conversion ratio
d = C
v-D
, the banker controls risk if v  v
P
. Risk control is lower than for write-down CoCos,
since the cut-off value v
P
is higher than v
WD
.
Higher conversion ratio d implies higher equity dilution (the banker gets v-D
v-D+C
< 1 of
the total equity upon conversion). Since upon conversion net equity value is still positive v >
D -C, a greater equity dilution reduces the net payoff to safe asset choice thus discouraging
risk control. In other words, such a conversion increases the risk control threshold and thus
reduces bank's incentives to control risk. We call the banker's risk control reduction from
at par CoCos relative to write-down Cocos an equity dilution effect presented as v
P
-v
W D
2
in
Figure 9. Note that by construction there will be no counteracting effect from CoCo dilution
at conversion.
Conversion with CoCo debt dilution
Conversion at par is not always possible, and it is never attempted in practice. We
consider now the realistic case of going concern CoCos with fixed conversion ratio d = C
vT -D
,
a design feature common to all outstanding CoCo bonds.
The banker's program and its solution are (8) as well as (9) and (10) respectively under
d = C
vT -D
. The critical value is v
C
above which the introduction of converted to equity CoCo
debt improves risk control.
Proposition 5 (CoCo dilution effect). Under CoCos with fixed conversion ratio d = C
vT -D
,
the banker controls risk if v  v
C
. Risk control is higher than for CoCos converted at par,
since the cut-off value v
C
is lower than v
P
.
12
Figure 9: Risk choice under at par CoCos. Equity dilution effect.
This result identifies the CoCo dilution effect, driven by the value transfer from CoCo debt
to equity upon conversion. Since the fixed conversion ratio is lower than the par conversion
ratio C
vT -D
< C
v-D
, upon conversion holders of CoCo debt get less than the promised face
value. As a result, the equity dilution effect is reduced, and the safe asset payoff increases
relative to the risky one. Thus, we can conclude that this produces better risk control. We
can call the banker's risk control increase from CoCos with a fixed conversion ratio relative
to at par CoCos a pure CoCo dilution effect presented as v
C
-v
P
2
in Figure 10.
Figure 10: Risk choice under CoCos with fixed conversion ratio. CoCo dilution effect.
Note that fixed conversion ratio depends on the trigger value.
Lemma 6. The value transfer from the holders of CoCo debt to equity holders (referred to as
CoCo dilution effect) increases with the trigger value vT
, so CoCo debt with a higher trigger
produces (ceteris paribus) greater risk reduction.
Note that because of the CoCo dilution effect, a high trigger reduces risk-shifting in-
centives beyond the direct effect of their higher equity content. The key reason is that
going-concern conversion ensures that equity value is positive under a safe strategy. Since
risk control dominates the risky strategy, this improves the banker's risk choice.
Table 1 summarizes the effects of CoCos on the banker's risk choice under different
formulations. Thus, principal write-down CoCo debt turns out to give the highest risk
reduction possible associated with convertible debt as it maximizes the positive effect of
debt reduction in the absence of equity dilution. However, it may also demand higher yield
to compensate its holders for the loss of value upon conversion.

4 Endogenous Yield
This section solves for the endogenous yield across debt types by a numerical calibration of
the results. Assessing CoCo debt pricing in terms of its contractual features is ultimately
necessary for any policy conclusions. Clearly, the yield depends both on the induced endoge-
nous risk and the relative priority of the different forms of bank debt.
Bail-inable debt
Consider possible payoffs under bail-inable debt (as shown in the upper panels of Figure
11). Under a safe choice debtholders are repaid C(1+y) if there is enough funds (v > D+Cy).
If interim leverage is low (v < D + Cy), then debtholders get what is left after deposits are
repaid v - (D - C). Under the risky choice, their payoff depends on the realization of V2
.
Figure 11: Payoff of CoCo debt converted to equity under different banker's choice
14
We showed earlier that bail-inable debt induces a safe choice when interim asset values
v  v
B
= v
D
+Cy. Thus, debtholders expect to get safe payoff with probability 1+-v
B
2
, and
risky payoff otherwise. Since bail-inable debt does not repay C in all states, the promised
yield must be positive for debtholders to break-even.
Note that for any types of CoCos, the payoff structure of CoCo debt holders is the same
as for the holders of bail-inable debt if no conversion is triggered. However, the distribution
of these payoffs depends on the induced risk choice.
Write-down CoCos
Next consider the case when the banker raises C of write-down CoCos and D - C in
deposits. If conversion is not triggered, holders of write-down CoCos get the same payoff
as bail-inable debt holders (as shown in the upper panels of Figure 11). Holders of write-
down CoCo debt get nothing if conversion is triggered, independently from the strategy of the
banker (see Figure 8). Two differences between bail-inable debt and write-down CoCos affect
their yields. First, in the states when conversion is triggered, write-down CoCos offer no
payment even if the bank is solvent, reducing the payoff to CoCo holders. Second, write-down
CoCos discourage risk, thus enhancing the probability of repayment when the interim value
is not revealed. The chance of getting a certain payoff equal to min {C(1 + y), v - D + C}
is higher in case of write-down CoCos.
Intuitively, these depend on the trigger value vT
and its precision . A higher trigger
as well as a higher precision increase the yield to compensate for the CoCoholders' losses in
conversion. At the same time, they also induce a safer banker's choice, and thus reduce the
required yield.
Equity conversion CoCo debt
We now consider the case of CoCos with a fixed equity conversion ratio.
If conversion is triggered, holders of CoCo debt receive a share of equity d
d+1
. In the case
of safe asset choice when v
C
 v < v
B
, they get a fraction of the safe payoff d
d+1
·(v -D+C).
In case of a risky choice when v < v
C
, their payoff depends on the asset realization at t = 2.
If the CoCos are not converted, holders of converted to equity CoCo debt get the same payoff
as bail-inable debt holders under safe and risky strategies. Those payoffs are shown in Figure
11. Recall that risk control is chosen for v  v
C
(as shown in Figure 10).
There are two critical differences between bail-inable debt and converted to equity CoCo
bonds that affect their yields. First, unlike bail-inable debt holders, CoCo holders face a
debt dilution loss when converted. Second, CoCos induce better risk control, increasing the
probability of some repayment either in the form of equity or debt (for v
C
 v < v
B
).
Comparing risk across CoCo debt types
Finally, we compare write-down CoCo and converted to equity CoCo debt. Again, there
are two effects. Intuitively, write-down CoCos should be more expensive, since conversion
leads to a complete loss of value. The resulting higher yield may reduce incentives to control
risk (and will require a higher trigger). At the same time, write-down CoCo debt induces
higher risk control than converted to equity CoCos because of the absence of any equity
dilution effect.
The comparison of the payoff structure together with the endogenous risk choice is shown
in Table 217. The formulas for implicitly given yields of these three types of debt are given
in the Appendix.
17"Risk" indicates that the banker makes risky choice, "Safe" indicates safe choice, "Conv wp " means
that conversion takes place with probability , "No Conv" means that no conversion takes place.

Table 2: Payoff structure and endogenous risk of debt instruments
Next, we perform a numerical calibration. We focus on the bank's risk control choice as
well as the magnitude of the yield for different forms of debt.
There are two key elements affecting the yield, aside from their contractual priority:
the induced amount of endogenous risk and the resulting amount of risk bearing by the
deposit insurance fund. This quantitative exercise is necessary to define the specific ranking
of required yields for different types of debt a well as their relative effect on endogenous
risk-shifting for the plausible set of parameter values.
First we characterize the yields for different forms of debt for the following set of param-
eter values: D = 0.95, C = 0.025,  = 0.035, p = 0.5,  = 0.05, z = 0.01. Figure 12 illustrates
yields for bail-inable debt, converted to equity CoCos and principal write-down CoCos for
the range of values of bank initial equity 1 - D (upper left panel), risky asset volatility 
(upper right panel) and the amount of certain type of debt C (lower panel).
Quantitative result 1.
The yield for converted to equity CoCos may be higher than that of bail-inable debt if initial
bank equity is high, and the amount of non-deposit debt C as well as risky asset volatility
 are low. In contrast, principal write-down CoCos require higher yield than converted to
equity CoCos or bail-inable debt.
This result points out that the risk reduction effect of converted to equity CoCos may
be sufficiently high to compensate the CoCoholders for the loss they face at conversion. So
that converted to equity CoCo debt may become cheaper than bail-inable debt. In the case
of write-down CoCos the CoCo dilution faced by their holders is so strong that it offsets the
risk reduction effect write-down CoCos obtain. As a result, the write-down CoCo holders will
require a higher yield than the holders of bail-inable debt and converted to equity CoCos.
Next we characterize the bank's risk control choice for different forms of debt. Figure 13
illustrates risk control thresholds for bail-inable debt v
B
, CoCos with fixed conversion ratio
v
C
and principal write-down CoCos v
WD
over the range of initial equity 1 - D (upper left
panel), asset volatility  (upper right panel) and the amount of debt C (lower panel).
Quantitative result 2.
A bank with principal write-down CoCos controls risk for a wider range of asset values
than a bank with CoCos with a fixed conversion ratio, i.e v
WD
< v
C
.
Recall that in the basic model with exogenous yield we get the same result because of
the absence of equity dilution effect. Here we also take into account the difference in yields
for these two types of CoCos. Note from Quantitative result 1 that write-down CoCos pay a
higher yield than converted to equity CoCos. In other words the yield effect (which reduces
incentives to control risk) is stronger in write-down CoCos. Quantitative result 2 highlights
how for our plausible set of parameter values, the yield effect is dominated by the equity
dilution effect.

5 Conversion at maturity
In the basic model we have treated CoCos at maturity as junior bail-inable debt. This
section considers an extension where CoCos convert at t = 2 if the asset value V2
falls below
the trigger vT
. Thus conversion can take place both as going concern at t = 1 as before and
as gone concern at the final date t = 2. Conversion ratio is d = C
vT -D
.
We first characterize the risk control decision for a given yield and trigger vT
.

is the risk-shifting incentive under CoCos
conversion.
18
There are two major differences relative to (8). In the first place, gone concern conversion
is now certain for highly levered banks with v < vT
if they choose risk control. Second, less
leveraged banks that take risk may now face a second chance of conversion at t = 2.
We next solve for the trigger that provides monotone incentives as in the basic model.
Lemma 7. For a bank with CoCos that may convert at maturity the trigger's value vT
=
max[D + Cy, v
M
] ensures monotonicity of the risk control choice. Its value is higher than
for CoCos that act as a junior debt at maturity v
B
.
Intuitively, for low levered banks the risky payoff becomes more attractive since its share-
holders receive a value transfer from CoCoholders upon conversion as long as D - C  V2
<
vT
. To offset this increased risk incentive, a higher trigger is necessary.
As it is not possible to compare analytically the risk control thresholds v
M
and v
C
under
an endogenous yield y, we study them under a numerical calibration.18
Figure 14 illustrates the risk control thresholds for both types of CoCos as a function of
the amount of CoCos C. The following result also holds for the wide range of parameter
values D and .
Figure 14: Risk control thresholds for CoCos with and without gone concern conversion
Quantitative result 4.
CoCos with possible conversion at maturity improve the risk control choice relative to
CoCos acting as junior debt, i.e v
M
< v
C
, but require a higher trigger and thus more frequent
conversion.
Intuitively, for highly levered banks with negative equity at t = 1 a safe choice makes
conversion certain, gaining a value transfer from CoCo debt, while a risky choice reduces the
chance of conversion.
18We calibrate using the following set of parameter values: D = 0.95, C = 0.02,  = 0.045, p = 0.5,  =
0.05, z = 0.01. See the Appendix for the derivation of the CoCos' yield.

6 Contingent Capital versus Equity
In this section we compare the risk reduction effect of converted to equity CoCo debt versus
equity. Specifically, the question we address is what amount of contingent capital is required
to provide the same risk incentives as equity?
Suppose the bank substitutes one unit of deposits by an extra amount of equity , or
by an amount k of CoCos. We solve for the level of k which guarantees an equivalent
improvement in risk control as with equity. The banker's program with extra equity is:
max
e
e · max [v - D + , 0] + (1 - e) · (v - D + - z + (v + ))
s.t. e  {0, 1} (12)
After adding extra equity , the bank has debt D - , so the amount of equity in the interim
period is v - D + . The bank chooses risk control whenever the difference in risky and safe
asset mean return z is higher than the risk-shifting incentives (v + ), or equivalently:
e =
1 if v  v
D
-
0 if v < v
D
-
(13)
where v
D
= max[-1(z), D] is a risk control threshold in the bank funded by deposits of
amount D and equity 1 - D19.
The expected improvement in risk control compared to the case of deposit funding is
2
, which reflects an increased range of asset values for which there is risk control. From
earlier results, the improvement in risk control achieved by CoCos is v
D
-v
C
2
, where v
C
is the
function of k instead of C.
So the condition v
D
-v
C
= guarantees that the expected risk control improvement from
introducing extra equity and CoCos k is the same.20
Proposition 6. The effect of CoCos on risk control is always weaker than of equity, unless
the trigger is perfectly informative ( = 1).
Lemma 8. The substitution ratio k between extra equity and CoCos k decreases in a convex
way with the probability of information revelation  if promised CoCo yield is sufficiently
low. Conditions for decreasing k function are (9) is satisfied and sufficiently low yield from:
yk
[v

· {(k + v
D
- D) · k
[v
D
+ (k - 1)]
+ (z - [v
D
+ (k - 1)])} (14)
and for its convexity - no condition (9) is satisfied and sufficiently low yield from:
y[k

- (1 + ky)) + 1]  -
(v

· {k
[v
D
+ (k - 1)] · (k + v
D
- D)
+ z - [v
D
+ (k - 1)]} (15)
19The banker controls risk whenever v > -1(z)- . However, if -1(z)- < D- , risk control threshold
changes to D - , since for negative net equity the banker never controls risk.
20As before, we set the trigger value to insure monotonic risk control in v, vT
= v
B
.
20
The equivalence ratio is very sensitive to . As  approaches zero, there is no amount
of CoCos that can substitute equity to ensure the same risk control.
Thus a key efficiency factor for CoCos depends on the precision of the trigger to signal a
state where risk-shifting incentives are high, while equity is always risk bearing. When the
trigger is less precise, conversion takes less often when required. As a result, a larger amount
of CoCos must be used to achieve the same risk control. However, when the required yield
is sufficiently high, increasing the amount of CoCos becomes counterproductive as it implies
a higher leverage and ultimately higher risk-taking.
7 Conclusions
This paper assesses how the design of bank contingent capital affects risk-taking incentives.
The issue is extensively discussed in the literature, but in existing models the asset choice
is exogenous (Pennacchi, 2011; Chen et al., 2017; Hilscher and Raviv, 2014). Our model
identifies explicitly the effect of contractual terms of contingent capital, necessary for its
optimal design and pricing. A clear result is that CoCo debt is superior to subordinated
debt that may be bailed in upon default, as it actively discourages ex ante risk. This results
helps to clarify the importance of going concern conversion which reduces leverage while the
bank is still solvent.
The main beneficial effect of conversion is to contain risk-shifting by reducing leverage in
states when risk incentives are high. We show that contrary to more traditional convertible
debt (Green, 1984), equity dilution has here a negative effect on incentives. In contrast, debt
dilution has a positive preventive effect. As a result, CoCo debt with a principal write-down
conversion may achieve a greater reduction in risk exposure than equity conversion CoCo
bonds. A countervailing effect may be caused by a higher yield, which increases effective
leverage. The overall result depends on the precise terms of CoCo debt. A numerical
calibration where the yield is endogenous suggests that principal write-down CoCos are
more efficient in reducing risk.
The framework enables to compare the relative effectiveness of CoCos in risk reduction
versus common equity, as well as other bank debt. While a one for one exchange ratio of
CoCos for equity is equivalent in terms of loss absorption upon default, this is no true for
its preventive effect. Contingent capital is much less efficient than equity because of limited
trigger precision, which does not ensure recapitalization in all states of excessive leverage.
In future research, we plan to study how using an accounting trigger may result in
regulatory forbearance, since bank reporting typically involves regulatory oversight. We are
also interested in how to design CoCo debt under a constrained amount of risk absorption
capacity. In general, research is needed to understand better the effect of CoCos on share
pricing, which is distorted by risk-shifting.

Lemma 1
We consider two distributions of V2
: normal and uniform. Denote x = V2
- D. we consider
x to be normally distributed with mean is v - D - z and variance 2 as well as uniformly
distributed with support [v-D-z-

3, v-D-z+

3]. We assume that v-D-z+

3 
0, else risky asset is never chosen. Moreover, v -D -z -

3  0, else no risk-shifting takes
place.
For a normal distribution, the expected value of bank equity (as defined in (1)) is:

Then the risk-shifting incentive (v) (as defined in (2)) is for a normal distribution:
(v) = (1 - F(0, v)) · E(x|x > 0, v) - (v - D - z) =
(v - D - z) · 
v - D - z

- 1 +  · 
(v - D - z)

whereas for a uniform distribution:
(v) = (1 - F(0, v)) · E(x|x > 0, v) - (v - D - z) =
(v - D - z -

It is easy to show that under these distributions (v)

is non-positive. For a normal
distribution it is:

Note also that (v)

Lemma 2
First, we show that the banker with v > v
D
controls risk. When solving the problem (5),
there are two cases: (1) v > D (positive equity upon safe choice); (2) v  D.
If v > D, e = 1 if z > (v). According to the Assumption 1, (v) is decreasing in v.
Then (v)  z implies that e = 1 if v  -1(z), which is binding if -1(z) > D. If v  D,
for any v e = 0.
Thus, the solution to (5) depends on the relationship between D and -1(z). If (D) >
z, -1(z) > D and the banker controls risk for v > -1(z). Otherwise, if (D)  z,
-1(z)  D and the banker controls risk for v  D. Thus, e = 1 if v > max [-1(z), D] 
v
D
.
Next, we show that if (D) > z (implying that -1(z) > D), the probability of risk
control (1+--1(z)
2
) decreases with . Note that 1+--1(z)
2
decreases in -1(z). Since
-1(z) is given by (v) = z, define H(v, z, )  (v) - z = 0. We use the implicit function
theorem to compute v

.

Proposition 1
First, we show that the banker with v > v
D
+ Cy controls risk. When solving the problem
(7), consider two cases: (1) v > D + Cy (positive equity upon safe choice); (2) v  D + Cy.
If v > D + Cy, e = 1 if z > (v - Cy). According to the Assumption 1, e = 1 if
v  -1(z) + Cy, which is binding if -1(z) > D. If v  D + Cy, e = 0 for any v from this
interval. Thus, the banker controls risk e = 1 if v > max [-1(z), D] + Cy = v
D
+ Cy  v
B
.
Next we show that the probability of risk control for (D) > z (implying that -1(z) >
D) (1+--1(z)-Cy
2
) decreases with . The proof of the of the derivative with respect to  is
identical to the one from Lemma 2.
Finally we show that 1+-v
B
2
declines with C and y. Note that the derivatives of 1+-v
D
-Cy
2
with respect to C and y are equal to - y
2
and - C
2
accordingly and both are negative.
Proposition 2
When solving the problem (8), there are two cases: (1) v > D + Cy (positive equity upon
safe choice); (2) v  D + Cy.
If v > D + Cy, the first order condition to (8) is that e = 1 if:
F =  ·
z - (v + C)
d + 1
+ (1 - )[z - (v - Cy)]  0 (16)
Note that F(v) is increasing in v:
F(v)
v
= -(1 - ) (v - Cy) - 
 (v + C)
d + 1
> 0 (17)
Then (16) is binding if for v = D + Cy it does not hold, i.e if (9) is satisfied. (9) implies
that at v = D + Cy, there is no risk control.
Next, consider the case when (9) is not satisfied. If v  D + Cy, the first order condition
to (8) is that e = 1 if:
G =  ·
z - (v + C)
d + 1
+ (1 - )[z - (v - Cy) - (v - D - Cy)]  0 (18)
Note that it is not clear whether G(v) is increasing in v:
G(v)
v
= -(1 - )[ (v - Cy) + 1] - 
 (v + C)
d + 1
(19)
where the first item is negative, and second is positive. Also note that the second derivative
of G(v) with respect to v is negative:
2G(v)
v2
= -(1 - ) (v - Cy) - 
 (v + C)
d + 1
< 0 (20)
Note however, that if G(v)
v
is non-positive for some v  D + Cy, it is not possible that for
v = D + Cy there is a risk control. Thus, if (9) is not satisfied, G(v) is increasing in v. The
banker controls risk if v is sufficiently high.
25
Thus, the solution to (8) depends on (9) and can be presented by v
C
defined in (10). For
v
C
 v  vT
, the banker controls risk.
Lemma 3
Using implicit function theorem for (10), we demonstrate that higher  reduces v
C
, or
decreases equivalently risk control:
v
C

=
-F/
F/v
if (9) holds
-G/
G/v
otherwise
(21)
where F
v
> 0 and G
v
> 0 from Lemma 2, and
F

=
z - (v + C)
d + 1
- [z - (v - Cy)]  0 (22)
G

=
z - (v + C)
d + 1
- [z - (v - Cy)] + (v - D - Cy)  0 (23)
the first item in (22) and (23) is non-negative, and the second is non-positive due to the fact
that (v - Cy) > (v + C) (recall that v
(v)  0). For F(v) = 0 and G(v) = 0, it must
be that z - (v - Cy)  0 and z - (v + C)  0.
Thus, independent of condition (9), v
C

< 0, and trigger precision reduces v
C
.
Lemma 4
We show that 1) v
C
 v
B
(CoCos induce safer choices that bail-inable debt), and 2) it can
be that v
C
> v
D
(CoCos may induce riskier choice than deposit funding).
First, note that v
C
decreases in  from Lemma 3. Thus, v
C
is at maximum when  = 0,
corresponding to:
F(v)=0
= z - (v - Cy) = 0 if (9) holds
G(v)=0
= z - (v - Cy) - (v - D - Cy) = 0 otherwise
(24)
If (9) holds, v
C
= -1(z) + Cy, otherwise v
C
 D + Cy (as shown in Lemma 2). Thus, for
both cases, v
C
 v
B
.
Second, since v
B
 v
D
for any positive y, for sufficiently low , v
C
> v
D
(the maximum
v
C
is v
B
). This implies that deposit funding may provide better risk control than CoCos due
to the presence of yield effect.
Lemma 5
Recall that the trigger is equal to vT
= v
B
= v
D
+ Cy. Note that if the amount of CoCos
increases, the trigger must go up:
(v
D
+ Cy)
C
= y > 0 (25)
26
The same holds for the increase in exogenous yield y:
(v
D
+ Cy)
y
= C > 0 (26)
Proposition 3
The banker's program is:
max
e
e · [max (v - D - Cy, 0) · (I(v  vT
) + (1 - ) · I(v < vT
))
equity value if no conversion and e=1

)
equity value if conversion and e=1
] +
(1 - e) · [(v - z - D - Cy + (v - Cy)) · (I(v  vT
) + (1 - ) · I(v < vT
))
equity value if no conversion and e=0
+
v - z - D + C + (v + C) ·  · I(v < vT
)
equity value if conversion and e=0
]
s.t. e  {0, 1} (27)
The proof is similar to the one of Lemma 2. This is just a special case when CoCos have
conversion ratio d = 0. The critical value v
WD
depends on condition (28) which describes
when v
WD
is above D + Cy:
[z - (D + C(1 + y))] + (1 - )(z - (D)) < 0 (28)
v
WD
is defined implicitly in (29):
[z - (v + C)] + (1 - )[z - (v - Cy)] = 0 if (28) holds
[z - (v + C)] + (1 - )[z - (v - Cy) - (v - D - Cy)] = 0 otherwise
(29)
This allows us to disentangle the effect of CoCos on risk control when there is no conversion
when trigger is breached.
To show this effect, we assume that introduction of CoCos only affects leverage upon con-
version. Using implicit function theorem for (10), we demonstrate the direct debt reduction
effect on v
C
:
v
C
C
|d=fixed,Cy=fixed

-F/C

decreases v

with the change in leverage only (but not affected by the yield or conversion ratio) compared
to the baseline case of only deposit funding v

Proposition 4
The proof is similar to the one of Lemma 2. This is a special case when CoCos have conversion
ratio d = C
v-D
. The critical value v
P
depends on the condition (36) which describes when v
P
is above D + Cy:
 ·
(z - [D + C(1 + y)](v - D)
v - D + C
+ (1 - )(z - (D)) < 0 (36)
v
P
is defined implicitly in (37):
 · [z-(v+C)](v-D)
v-D+C

 · [z-(v+C)](v-D)
v-D+C
+ (1 - )[z - (v - Cy) - (v - D - Cy)] = 0 otherwise
(37)

To disentangle the effect of equity dilution, we assume that introduction of CoCos only
affects conversion ratio with leverage and yield being fixed. Using implicit function theorem
28
for (10), we show the equity dilution effect on v
C
:
v

d
|C=fixed,Cy=fixed
=
-F/d
F/v
|C=fixed,Cy=fixed
if (9) holds
-G/d

(41)
where F

are given as in (31) and (33), and

(z - (v + C))
(d + 1)2
)  0 (43)
(44)
Independent on (9), v
C
d
|C=fixed,Cy=fixed
 0 implying that the increase in d through higher
amount of CoCos increases the dilution of the banker's share and increases v
C
. We define
equity dilution effect as the reduction in risk control associated with the change in conversion
ratio compared to the case of write-down CoCos with no conversion into shares v
W D
|Cy=0-v
P
2
,
where v
P
|Cy=0
is defined by (37) for a paid yield Cy = 0.
Since higher conversion ratio implies higher risk control, v
P
> v
WD
.
Proposition 5
The proof is based on the one of Lemma 2 for d = C
vT -D
. The critical value v
C
depends on
(45) which describes when v
C
is above D + Cy:
 ·
(z - [D + C(1 + y)](vT
- D)
vT
- D + C
+ (1 - )(z - (D)) < 0 (45)
v
C
is defined implicitly in (46):
 · [z-(v+C)](vT -D)
vT -D+C
+ (1 - )[z - (v - Cy)] = 0 if (45) holds
 · [z-(v+C)](vT -D)
vT -D+C
+ (1 - )[z - (v - Cy) - (v - D - Cy)] = 0 otherwise
(46)
Note that fixed conversion d = C
vT -D
produces lower equity dilution to the banker than
conversion at par with d = C
v-D
, since conversion occurs only for v < vT
. Recall from
Proposition 4 that lower equity dilution results in better risk control. This implies that
changing conversion ratio from at par to a fixed one produces better risk control. As a
result, v
C
< v
P
.
Changing conversion from at par to the fixed one increases the ex ante probability of
bank risk control 1+-v
C
2
. We call this increase a CoCo dilution effect as the risk control
increase associated with the lower equity dilution and value transfer from CoCoholders to
the equityholders (banker). We denote it by v
C
|Cy=0
- v
P
|Cy=0
, where v
C
|Cy=0
is defined by
(46) for a paid yield Cy = 0.
29
Lemma 6
Note that fixed conversion ratio d = C
vT -D
decreases with vT
. Thus, if vT
goes up, conversion
ratio goes down. From Proposition 5, lower d increases risk control by diluting CoCoholders.
As a result, higher vT
enhances CoCos' risk reduction effect.

where vM

is a properly set trigger given implicitly by vT
= max[D + Cy, v
M
].
Proof of Lemma 7
The solution to the problem (11) identifies two new critical interim asset values. First, v
M
is the risk control threshold for those banks with asset value above the trigger, given as a
30
maximum of D + Cy and the asset value given implicitly by:
R
nc
- v - D - Cy = 0 (51)
where
R
nc
= (1 - ) · [(F(vT
) - F(D - C)) · E
V2
- D + C
d + 1
D - C < V2
< vT
+
(1 - F(vT
)) · E(V2
- D - Cy|V2
> vT
)] (52)
is the bank's payoff under no risk control and no conversion at t = 1.
Second, v
M
is the risk control threshold for banks with asset value below vT
, given by :
R
nc
+  ·
v - z - D + C + (v + C)
d + 1
-
v - D + C
d + 1
= 0 (53)
We observe that bank's risk control choice is not monotone in its asset value v: banks
with v  [vT
, v
B
) still do not control risk (as without CoCos), whereas highly levered banks
with asset value v  [v
M
, vT
) choose to exercise risk control. The introduction of CoCos with
conversion at maturity implies that banks with v  (v
B
, v
M
] give up on risk control.
Next we show that v
M
 v
B
. Recall that v
B
is implicitly given by max (v - D - Cy, 0) =
v-z-D-Cy+(v-Cy) from (7), whereas v
M
is implicitly given by max (v - D - Cy, 0) =
R
nc
from (11) and (52).
If R
nc
 v - z - D - Cy + (v - Cy), then the risky payoff is higher for CoCos with
conversion at t = 2, and it must be that v
M
 v
B
. The difference between those payoffs
R
nc
- v - z - D - Cy + (v - Cy) equals to:
(F(vT
) - F(D + Cy)) · E
V2
- D + C
d + 1
D + Cy  V2
< vT

E(V2

) +
(F(D + Cy) - F(D - C)) · E
V2
- D + C
d + 1
D - C  V2
< D + Cy (54)
The item in the last line is positive.The item in the first two lines is non-negative as soon as
V2-D+C
d+1
> V2
- D - Cy for the range D + Cy  V2
< vT
. It is enough to show that
V2
- D + C
d + 1
> V2
- D (55)
which for d = C
vT -D
is
(V2
- D + C)(vT

(V2

vT
- D + C
=
C(vT
- V2
)
vT
- D + C
(56)
which is non-negative for V2
< vT
. This implies that v
M
 v
B
(equality may occur if both
thresholds are equal to D + Cy).

Here we prove that k  1. The proof is by contradiction. Assume that k < 1. Consider
F(v
D
- |k , d) = 0. Note that [v
D
- ]  z, since banker with v < v
D
does not control
risk by definition of v
D
. Since the whole expression is equal to zero, and the second term is
non-negative, the first term should be non-positive. Hence,
[v
D
+ (k - 1)] - z  0
This is true only if v  v
D
. If k < 1, then v
D
+ (k - 1) < v
D
. This is a contradiction.
The same logic applies to G(v
D
- |k , d) = 0, where the second item is also negative, and
even more smaller than z - [v
D
- ].
Thus, it always holds that k  1, and higher amount of CoCos is required to provide the
same effect as equity.
Note that if  = 1, it must be the case that z - [v
D
+ (k - 1)] = 0, which is true only
if k = 1.
