Summary
Background and objectives The profound organ shortage has resulted in longer waiting times and increased
mortality for those awaiting kidney transplantation. Consequently, patients are turning to older living donors. It
is unclear if an upper age limit for donation should exist, both in terms of recipient and donor outcomes.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements In the United States, 219 healthy adults aged 70 have do-
nated kidneys at 80 of 279 transplant centers. Competing risks models with matched controls were used to
study the independent association between older donor age and allograft survival, accounting for the com-
peting risk of recipient mortality as well as other transplant factors.
Results Among recipients of older live donor allografts, graft loss was significantly higher than matched
50-to 59-year-old live donor allografts (subhazard ratio [SHR] 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16 to 2.28,
P  0.005) but similar to matched nonextended criteria 50-to 59-year-old deceased donor allografts (SHR
1.19, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.63, P  0.3). Mortality among living kidney donors aged 70 was no higher than
healthy matched controls drawn from the NHANES-III cohort; in fact, mortality was lower, probably re-
flecting higher selectivity among older live donors than could be captured in National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey III (NHANES-III; HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.65, P  0.001).
Conclusions These findings support living donation among older adults but highlight the advantages of
finding a younger donor, particularly for younger recipients.

Introduction
More than 80,000 patients currently await deceased-
donor kidney transplantation in the United States,
many of whom will die before a suitable organ be-
comes available (1,2). Patients with a willing, healthy
live donor can be spared the morbidity and mortality of
the waiting list. Efforts to expand live donor kidney
transplantation have included incompatible kidney
transplantation (3), kidney-paired donation (4,5), nondi-
rected donation (6), and the use of organs from live
donors who may have previously been excluded be-
cause of hypertension, older age, or high body mass
index (BMI) (7). Specifically, some centers are increas-
ingly willing to transplant kidneys from live donors
ages 70 and older (LD70s).
Two recent studies showed that living donors on
average have comparable survival to matched healthy
controls (8,9). However, no study has specifically
evaluated postdonation survival among LD70s, who
comprise such a small proportion of the living donor
pool that any outcomes related to this subgroup
would be lost in analyses of "average" outcomes.
Furthermore, some studies have suggested an in-
creased rate of chronic dysfunction in allografts from
older donors (10), whereas others suggest that older
live donor grafts perform as well as younger ones
(11­13). Prior studies have been limited in two impor-
tant ways. First, prior studies have defined "older
donors" as those over 60, thereby diluting any contri-
bution from those aged 70; also, existing studies
compare those over 60 to the entire population of
donors under 60, effectively creating too wide an age
range of controls (ages 18 to 60) to generate meaning-
ful inferences. Third, the most intuitive question con-
cerning LD70s is that of late allograft loss: will the
viable, nonsclerotic nephron mass of a kidney from a
70-year-old last as long as that from a 50-year-old?
Prior studies have analyzed either all-cause graft loss
(considering death as a graft-loss event) or death-
censored graft loss; both are inappropriate, because
establishing an independent association between do-
nor age and recipient outcomes is either impossible
(because of inclusion of death when analyzing all-
cause graft loss) or misleading (because of informa-
tive censoring when analyzing death-censored graft
loss).
The goals of this study were as follows: to describe
a national cohort of live donors aged 70 to compare

graft and patient survival of the recipients of these kidneys
with those of kidneys from younger donors using compet-
ing risks models and matched controls, and to compare
donor survival with matched controls from the general
population.
Materials and Methods
This study used data from the Scientific Registry of
Transplant Recipients (SRTR). The SRTR data system in-
cludes data on all donor, wait-listed candidates, and trans-
plant recipients in the United States, submitted by the
members of the Oran Procurement and Transplantation
Network (OPTN), and has been described elsewhere. The
Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), US
Department of Health and Human Services provides over-
sight to the activities of the OPTN and SRTR contractors. It
was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
Study Population: Live Donors
A total of 97,782 live donors were identified between
January 1, 1990, and May 31, 2010. Among these donors,
219 were aged 70 to 84. Two donors aged 95 were excluded
after concluding that there were likely data errors, because
multiple donor and recipient demographic fields were
identical in both entries. Postdonation death in the donor,
as well as posttransplant death in the recipient, was re-
ported by the transplant centers and augmented by linkage
to the Social Security Death Master File.
Study Population: Matched Controls for Recipients
In an attempt to identify an appropriate control group
for recipients of kidneys from living donors aged 70,
matched recipients from among 16,051 live donors age 50
to 59 (LD50s) during the study period were selected. From
this group, three matched recipients were identified for
each recipient from a live donor aged 70, based on recip-
ient characteristics: history of hypertension, age, ethnicity,
years of dialysis, insurance status (public versus private),
peak Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA), and year of trans-
plantation. Matched controls were drawn from this age
group (ages 50 to 59) because living donation is more
common in the age group, but it represents a significant
difference in age, which is our covariate of interest. Simi-
larly, three matched controls were identified from among
21,195 recipients of kidneys from deceased donors ages 50
to 59 who did not meet extended criteria donor (ECD)
criteria in the same time period. Subjects for whom ade-
quate matches could not be found (n  16 for live donors
ages 50 to 59 and n  6 for deceased donors ages 50 to 59)
were dropped from analysis.
Study Population: Matched Controls for Donors
Matched controls were identified from participants in
the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES-III) conducted between 1988 and 1994. All
NHANES-III participants underwent extensive medical
evaluation, including medical history, physical examina-
tion, laboratory studies, and other medical workup. This
group represents an appropriate control when assessing
the primary outcome of death because (1) it is a nationally
representative study including largely healthy individuals;
(2) the granularity of medical data available from this
study facilitates matching based on known variables that
may be associated with the outcome of interest; and (3) it
enrolled a substantial number of participants of similar age
to our study group (8,14). Death in this cohort was deter-
mined in a similar manner to that of the study population.
Of NHANES-III participants, 9364 without contraindica-
tions to live kidney donation were identified. The closest
matched control for each live kidney donor was selected
from this population based on the following donor char-
acteristics, where available: age, BMI, systolic BP, educa-
tion level, ethnicity, and smoking history, using a process
of iterative expanding radius matching as described pre-
viously; availability and missingness of OPTN donor data
over time was carefully delineated in the cited study (8).
Statistical Analyses: Recipient Outcomes
Nonparametric competing risks models as described by
Coviello and Boggs were used to estimate the cumulative
incidence functions (CIFs) for the outcome of graft failure
(15). This approach was chosen to simultaneously model
the risk of two outcomes, each of which precludes the
assessment of the other (in this case, graft failure before
death and death with a functioning graft), and to avoid the
assumption of independent risks (noninformative censor-
ing) made in Kaplan-Meier models (15,16). The cumulative
incidence estimate (I
^
k
) of graft failure was calculated using
the following equation:
^
Ik
(t) 

jPtjt
^
S(tj  1
)
dkj
nj
where ^
S(tj1
) is the overall Kaplan-Meier estimate (sur-
vival with a functioning graft) and dkj
/nj
estimates the
hazard of graft failure (the number of events happening at
a given time tj
divided by the number of individuals at risk
before time tj
(15). Pepe and Mori tests were performed to
establish the statistical significance of any differences in
CIF between groups (16).
To quantify the magnitude of the change in hazard in the
context of a competing risk model, the semiparametric
method of Fine and Gray was utilized to model the hazard
for the competing event of interest (in this case, graft loss)
(17). This method facilitates the modeling of individual
hazards in the subdistribution for the failure of interest (in
this case, the subhazard of developing graft failure before
death) and permits the calculation of a subhazard ratio
(SHR) while statistically adjusting for known confounders.
A visual assessment of the proportionality of subhazards
was checked graphically.
In the case of mortality, the competing risk model pre-
sented above would generate a CIF for death in competi-
tion with graft loss and only models death in those recip-
ients who have not sustained graft loss. Of course, graft
loss itself is an important predictor of mortality, and death
occurring after graft loss is a highly relevant outcome.
Consequently, the competing risks methodology is not an
ideal way to model overall mortality. Therefore, although
death should be considered a competing risk in the assess-
ment of graft loss, it may be inappropriate to consider graft
loss as a competing risk in the assessment of death. As
2888 Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology
such, traditional Kaplan-Meier functions with log-rank
tests and Cox proportional hazards models were used to
model the outcome of death.
Statistical Analyses: Donor Outcomes
Differences between the study population and control
groups were determined using chi-squared analysis for
dichotomous variables and two-sided t tests for continu-
ous variables. To examine center-level clustering of older
live donors, Lorenz curves were generated (18,19). Sur-
vival estimates were obtained by Kaplan-Meier methods,
with administrative censoring at the time of linkage to the
Social Security Death Master File. For live donors, time at
risk was accrued from the date of donation. For NHANES-
III controls, time at risk was accrued from the date of
enrollment into the study. After matching, log-rank tests
and Cox proportional hazard models were used to com-
pare survival.
All analyses were performed using STATA 11.2/MP for
Linux (College Station, Texas).
Results
Study Population: Donors
Between 1990 and 2010, 219 live persons between the
ages of 70 and 84 (mean 72.1, SD 2.3) donated kidneys
(Table 1, Figure 1A). The annual number of live donors
aged 70 ranged from 6 to 19, with an increasing trend
over time (Figure 1B). Compared with live donors ages 50
to 59, live donors aged 70 were less often women (45.2%
versus 63.4%, P  0.001), less likely to have a BMI more
than 30 (8.7% versus 21.7%, P  0.001), more often hyper-
tensive (5.9% versus 1.7%, P  0.001), and more often white
(91.7% versus 82.0%, P  0.001). Of 279 centers that per-
formed live donor kidney transplants during the study
period, only 80 reported using live donors aged 70. Of
these 80 centers, 40 reported only one such donor, and 17
additional centers reported only two. The bulk of live
donors aged 70 occurred at only 17 centers (Figure 1C).
Study Population: Recipients
Recipients of kidneys from live donors aged 70 were
on average older (mean age 56 versus 46, P  0.001). Live

donors aged 70 were also more likely to donate to their
children (36.8% versus 24.3%) and spouse/partner (34.5%
versus 19.5%). Recipients from the two populations were
similar in terms of education, gender, BMI, peak PRA, and
years on dialysis (Table 1).
Recipient Outcomes: Graft Failure
When graft loss and death were analyzed in a nonpara-
metric competing risk model, 1-, 5-, and 10-year rates of
graft failure among recipients of kidneys from live donors
aged 70 were 7.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.2% to
11.6%), 14.9% (95% CI 16.6% to 27.4%), and 33.3% (95% CI
24.9% to 41.8%), respectively (Figure 2A). Among matched
recipients of live donors aged 50 to 59, 1-, 5-, and 10-year
graft failure rates were 5.0% (95% CI 3.4% to 6.9%), 12.0%
(95% CI 9.3% to 15.0%), and 21.6% (95% CI 17.5% to 26.7%),
respectively. Graft failure was significantly higher among
recipients of kidneys from live donors aged 70 than those
who received kidneys from live donors ages 50 to 59 (SHR
1.62, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.28, P  0.005). However, among
recipients age 65, no statistically significant difference
between recipients of live donors aged 70 and live do-
nors ages 50 to 59 was seen (SHR 1.70, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.04,
P  0.07). Among matched recipients of kidneys from
non-ECD deceased donors aged 50 to 59, 1-, 5-, and 10-year
graft failure rates were 7.4% (95% CI 5.5% to 9.6%), 19.4%
(95% CI 16.1% to 22.9%), and 30.8% (95% CI26.3% to
35.4%), respectively, and no statistically significant differ-
ence was found in graft failure between recipients of kid-
neys from live donors aged 70 and those who received
organs from non-ECD deceased donors ages 50 to 59 (SHR
1.19, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.62, P  0.3).
Recipient Outcomes: Patient Survival
Patient survival was calculated using standard Kaplan-
Meier methods, 1-, 5-, and 10-year rates of survival among
recipients of kidneys from live donors aged 70 were
93.1% (95% CI 88.5% to 96.0%), 74.5% (95% CI 66.8% to
80.7%), and 56.2% (95% CI 46.1% to 65.1%), respectively
(Figure 2B). Among matched recipients of kidneys from
live donors ages 50 to 59, 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates
were 96.4% (95% CI 94.5% to 97.6%), 83.3% (95% CI 79.2%
to 86.1%), and 64.2% (95% CI 58.7% to 69.1%), respectively.
No statistically significant difference in recipient survival
was seen between those who received kidneys from live
donors aged 70 and matched recipients of kidneys from
live donors ages 50 to 59 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.31, 95% CI
0.95 to 1.69, P  0.1). Among matched recipients of kidneys
from non-ECD deceased donors ages 50 to 59, 1-, 5-, and
10-year survival rates were 92.7% (95% CI 90.3 to 94.5%),
76.2% (95% CI 72.1% to 80.0%), and 47.7% (95% CI 42.2% to
53.0%), respectively. Again, no statistically significant dif-
ference in patient survival was seen between recipients of
live donors aged 70 and matched recipients from non-
ECD deceased donors ages 50 to 59 (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.60
to 1.03, P  0.1).

the best-fit linear trend across time. The curves in (C) illustrate the distribution of living donor kidney transplants across centers in the United
States, stratified by donor age. The shift of the LD70 curve to the bottom right of the graph indicates that only a few centers performed live
donor kidney transplants using donors aged  70.

Donor Outcomes
Survival among live donors aged 70 was 99.5% (95%
CI 96.6% to 99.9%) at 1 year, 95.8% (95% CI 91.4% to 98.1%)
at 5 years, and 90.0% (95% CI 83.5% to 94.0%) at 10 years.
Among matched nondonor controls from the general pop-
ulation, survival was 99.1% (95% CI 96.4% to 99.8%) at 1
year, 91.8% (95% CI 87.3% to 94.7%) at 5 years, and 73.0%
(95% CI 65.6% to 79.0%) at 10 years. The hazard ratio for
mortality comparing LD70s to matched NHANES-III con-
trols was 0.37 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.65, P  0.001) (Figure 3).
Discussion
Recipients of live donor kidneys aged 70 had a signif-
icantly higher rate of graft loss compared with recipients of
younger live donor kidneys aged 50 to 59. These kidneys
were in fact more comparable to kidneys from non-ECD
deceased donors aged 50 to 59.
Our findings directly contradict recent studies. In a
recently published study that included 73 older living do-
nors (over 60), Young et al. reported no statistically signif-
icant difference in graft loss (both all-cause and death-
censored) but a counter intuitive 2.7-fold higher risk of
recipient death (13). Another that included 117 donors over
60 (with 25 donors over 70) concluded that death-censored
graft loss was not associated with donor age, using a
multivariate model where almost no coefficient was statis-
tically significant (20).
Our analysis should be distinguished from previous
studies for several reasons. Most importantly, our power to
detect differences between the subgroups is significantly
greater than any other study of older living donors of
which we are aware, in terms of sample size, length of
follow-up, and extremes of donor age. For example, sam-
ple size calculations indicate that it requires 199 patients in
each group to have 80% power to detect a one-sided dif-
ference of 30% versus 20% allograft loss between older and
younger live donors; with only 73 patients, this power
drops to 44% (21).
Also, our methodology differs substantially from previ-
ous studies. A matched control study design was chosen to
compensate for the inherent instability of comparing a very
small group (n  219) with a much larger group (n 
16,051) using typical regression models; in the latter, im-
portant covariate effects in the smaller group (which is the
group of interest) are missed. Second, competing risks
models were chosen to make inferences about the indepen-
dent association between older donor age and graft loss.
Modeling choices in previous studies made analyzing the
association between advanced donor age and the allograft
itself either impossible (because of inclusion of death when
analyzing all-cause graft loss) or misleading (because the
assumptions of noninformative censoring that accompany
a death-censored graft loss analysis are violated). Finally,
calculating the cumulative incidence functions nonpara-
metrically (which is possible when competing risks and
matched controls methods are combined), in the manner of
Coviello and Boggess, avoids the assumption of propor-
tional hazards (15).
There are important potential limitations to this study.
The relatively small sample size limits the precision of our
estimates. However, this study represents the patient pop-
ulation in the United States in its totality, and, to our
knowledge, is the largest study of its kind. Missing data
can limit the identification of matched controls; however,
only 16 recipients went unmatched when comparing with
Figure 2. | Cumulative incidence function (CIF) of graft failure (A)
and Kaplan-Meier curve of patient survival (B) among recipients of
kidneys from live donors age >70 (LD70) versus matched controls
from among recipients of live donors age 50 to 59 (LD50) and
nonextended criteria deceased donors aged 50 to 59 (DD50).

live donors ages 50 to 59, only six recipients went un-
matched when comparing with non-ECD deceased donors
ages 50 to 59, and missing data were handled using novel
matching techniques for donors so it is highly unlikely that
missing data contributed to false inferences (8). Also, al-
though we did not find a statistically significant difference
in graft survival between the study and control group
when only matched recipients over the age of 65 were
considered, this may be related to the smaller sample size
in this subgroup. Finally, when interpreting our findings, it
must be remembered that the older donors who represent
our study group represent a highly selected group, which
likely does not represent the unscreened donor population
presenting at any given center. As such, these results
should not be interpreted as implying that all prospective
donors over the age of 70 will have excellent long-term
survival.
Kidneys from live donors aged 70 may not last as long
in younger recipients as kidneys from younger living do-
nors, even although recipients appear to have similar sur-
vival. However, the clinical decision faced by a kidney
transplant candidate might be more complex; for example,
deciding to forgo live donor transplantation from an older
donor might mean waiting several years for a deceased
donor transplant. Because our comparison of recipients of
older living donor versus younger deceased donor kidneys
involves those who received transplants, it does not take
into account the significant morbidity and mortality asso-
ciated with the waitlist. This implies that, although the
performance of grafts from live donors aged 70 may be
less optimal than grafts from live donors ages 50 to 59 and
may be comparable to grafts from non-ECD deceased do-
nors ages 50 to 59, they still are preferable to the well
documented risks of joining a lengthening waitlist where
more than half of candidates over 60 are predicted to die
before receiving a deceased donor transplant (2). Further-
more, avoiding the waitlist and proceeding directly to live
donation has important implications for the economic im-
pact of ESRD both at the individual and societal level. With
a national median wait-time exceeding 3 years, the costs of
long-term hemodialysis and its complications are high (22).
For patients who do not have a young, compatible live
donor, kidney transplantation from a healthy older live
donor remains a reasonable option.
These data have implications that expand the donor pool
in other ways. For instance, a young transplant candidate
may be hesitant to accept a kidney from a compatible
living donor aged 70, as our data suggest that graft loss
may be higher. Such a pair could participate in a kidney
paired donation with an incompatible pair with a younger
donor. In this scenario, both pairs would benefit, as the
younger recipient could receive a younger kidney, and the
incompatible recipient would receive a compatible kidney
(23,24). Compatible paired donation has the potential to
expand the number of pairs participating in kidney paired
donation and thus increase the likelihood that an incom-
patible pair could find a match, while simultaneously di-
recting multiple living donor kidneys to the recipients who
could derive the most benefit from them.
In conclusion, we found that a cohort of appropriately
living kidney donors aged 70 had excellent 10-year over-
all survival rates. However, we also found that recipients
of live donor kidneys aged 70 had a significantly higher
rate of graft loss compared with recipients of younger live
donor kidneys ages 50 to 59. These kidneys were in fact
more comparable to kidneys from non-ECD deceased do-
nors ages 50 to 59. These results suggest that appropriately
selected donor-recipient pairs can benefit from transplan-
tation from live donors aged 70.
