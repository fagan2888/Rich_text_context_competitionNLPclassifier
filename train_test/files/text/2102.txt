Periodontitis, the progressive loss of the alveolar bone around the
teeth and the major cause of tooth loss in adults, is due to oral
microorganisms, including Porphyromonas gingivalis. Periodonti-
tis is associated with a local overly aggressive immune response
and a spectrum of systemic effects, but the role of this condition
in orodigestive cancers is unclear. We prospectively examined
clinically ascertained periodontitis (N 5 12 605) and serum IgG
immune response to P.gingivalis (N 5 7852) in relation to orodi-
gestive cancer mortality among men and women in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III. A detailed oral
health exam was conducted from 1988 to 1994 in survey Phases
I and II, whereas serum IgG for P.gingivalis was measured from
1991 to 1994 in Phase II only. One hundred and five orodigestive
cancer deaths were ascertained through 31 December 2006.
Periodontitis (moderate or severe) was associated with increased
orodigestive cancer mortality [relative risks (RR) 5 2.28, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 5 1.17­4.45]; mortality risks also increased
with increasing severity of periodontal disease (P trend 5 0.01).
Periodontitis-associated mortality was in excess for colorectal
(RR 5 3.58; 95% CI 5 1.15­11.16) and possibly for pancreatic
cancer (RR 5 4.56; 95% CI 5 0.93­22.29). Greater serum
P.gingivalis IgG tended to be associated overall with increased
orodigestive cancer mortality (P trend 5 0.06); P.gingivalis-
associated excess orodigestive mortality was also found for healthy
subjects not exhibiting overt periodontal disease (RR 5 2.25;
95% CI 5 1.23­4.14). Orodigestive cancer mortality is related
to periodontitis and to the periodontal pathogen, P.gingivalis,
independent of periodontal disease. Porphyromonas gingivalis is
a biomarker for microbe-associated risk of death due to orodigestive
cancer.
Introduction
The oral periodontium supports the teeth in the alveolar bone of the
jaws. Periodontitis, the progressive loss of the alveolar bone around
the teeth and the major cause of tooth loss in adults, is due to oral
microorganisms, including Porphyromonas gingivalis (1). There is
growing evidence that poor periodontal health is associated with sys-
temic health deficits (2,3), including cancer (4,5). Although these
disease associations are suspected to have a microbial basis, there is
currently no epidemiologic evidence pointing to specific microbial
etiologic agents.
In a prospective study of a nationally representative US population
sample, we examined whether periodontal disease, assessed by dental
exam, is associated with orodigestive cancer mortality. To directly
address microbe­cancer associations, we also prospectively investi-
gated the relationship of serum antibody levels for P.gingivalis in
relation to orodigestive cancer mortality.
Materials and methods
Study population
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III)
survey, which was conducted in two phases between 1988 and 1994 by the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC), was designed to examine the health and nutritional
status of the non-institutionalized USA population (6), including estimates for
three major racial/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks
and Mexican Americans, by oversampling the latter two populations. Data
were collected by interview and physical examination in Phases I and II,
conducted in Mobile Examinations Centers, including blood sampling in Phase
II for measurement of serum P.gingivalis IgG and other serum constituents. All
procedures were approved by the NCHS Institutional Review Board, and all
subjects provided written informed consent.
For assessment of the relationship of periodontal disease to orodigestive
cancer mortality, we restricted eligibility to those who were of age 17 years
and older and who had completed the periodontal exam (n 5 12 934) in Phase I
or Phase II of the survey. Those who had a prior cancer (n 5 320), had un-
known mortality status (n 5 7) or missing smoking status (n 5 2) were
excluded, resulting in a cohort of 12 605 subjects. For assessment of the
relationship of serum P.gingivalis IgG to orodigestive cancer mortality, we re-
stricted eligibility to Phase II participants included above who were also assessed
serologically for serum IgG antibody against P.gingivalis (n 5 9152). After
restricting for age below 17 years (n 5 1040), unknown mortality status
(n 5 7) and prior cancer (n 5 290), we included for study 7852 participants
in the analysis (exclusion may overlap).
Periodontal disease
For assessment of periodontal disease, periodontal attachment loss and pocket
depth were evaluated by dental examiners trained to follow a written set of
objective standards to minimize examiner variability by eliminating conditions
known to be sources of disagreement (6). If the examiner was equivocal
regarding the appropriate score, the lesser score was assigned. All teeth pres-
ent, excluding roots, were scored. We defined periodontal disease based on the
guidelines of the CDC and the American Academy of Periodontology (CDC/
AAP) (7). Briefly, subjects were classified as having severe periodontitis if at
least two teeth had interproximal (between teeth) attachment loss !6 mm and
at least one tooth had interproximal pocket depth !5 mm. Subjects were
classified as having moderate periodontitis if they did not meet criteria for
severe periodontitis but they had at least two teeth with interproximal attach-
ment loss !4 mm or at least two teeth with interproximal pocket depth !5 mm.
Serum IgG antibody to Porphyromonas gingivalis
Serum P.gingivalis IgG was chosen for study to capture evidence of systemic
exposure to this bacterium because it is a validated NHANES III periodontal
pathogen (8), with well-described periodontal pathogenicity (9). Detailed
information on the assay used to measure P.gingivalis IgG has been provided
elsewhere (10). Briefly, levels of the serum P.gingivalis IgG were assayed with
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay during the baseline survey or shortly
thereafter. Antibody measurements were reported in enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay units of IgG (EU). Based on a previous report in NHANES III
validating this assay for periodontal disease, we assigned three categories of
P.gingivalis IgG (8,11), associated with none or mild (i.e. normal) (,69 EU),
moderate (69.1­119.0 EU) and severe (119.0 þ EU) periodontal disease,
respectively.
End point ascertainment
Follow-up of the cohort was from the date of the baseline physical and peri-
odontal examination (between 1988 and 1994) until 31 December 2006. Mor-
tality was based on the NHANES III Linked Mortality File (ICD-10; with 113
underlying causes of death), ascertained through probabilistic linkage with the
National Death Index (NDI), with cancer deaths coded by the ICD-10 classi-
fication. Orodigestive cancers were as follows: lip, oral cavity and pharynx
(C00-C14), esophagus (C15), stomach (C16), pancreas (C25), liver (C22) and
colon, rectum and anus (C18-C21). Survival follow-up continued until death or
31 December 2006, whichever was earlier.
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed using SUDAAN (release 9.0.1; Research Triangle
Institute) to account for the complex sample design of NHANES III, including
Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; CI, confidence interval; EU, enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay unit; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey; RR, relative risks.

the sample weights that were used to account for the unequal probability of
selecting individuals and for survey non-response (12). v2 tests and multiple
linear regression were used to assess associations of baseline demographic and
health-related characteristics with periodontal disease and serum P.gingivalis
IgG. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to compute mor-
tality relative risks (RR) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) in
relation to categories of periodontal disease and serum P.gingivalis IgG. RR
were calculated with time elapsed since survey date (in months) as the time-
dependent parameter. RR were adjusted for age and sex and additionally for
smoking status (never, former, current and unknown), education, race/ethnicity
(non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American and other)
and body mass index (BMI) [BMI ,25; 25 to ,30; 30­39.9 kg/m2; unknown
or unlikely (BMI ,15 or .40)]. We tested the proportional hazards assump-
tion by modeling interaction terms of time and continuous serum P.gingivalis
IgG levels and found no statistically significant deviations. For visual inspec-
tion, we also applied non-parametric regression using cubic splines (13) to
examine the association between serum P.gingivalis IgG and risk of orodiges-
tive cancer mortality. For this analysis, the number and location of the knots
were identified through a stepwise selection process (14). Statistical signifi-
cance was determined by a two-sided P , 0.05.
Results
Among 12 605 NHANES III participants examined for periodontal
disease, 1826 (14.4%) had moderate and 379 (3.0%) had severe peri-
odontal disease. Among 7852 subjects assessed for serum P.gingivalis
IgG, levels were significantly greater in study participants with mod-
erate (median: 86.1 EU; inter-quartile range: 70.6­120.6) and severe
periodontitis (117.8; 85.3­248.50) compared with normal subjects
(70.2; 62.0­88.3). Compared with subjects with (moderate or severe)
periodontitis, normal subjects tended to be younger, female, non-
Hispanic White, better-educated, never-smokers and of lower BMI
(Table I). Participants with low serum P.gingivalis IgG levels
(,69.1 EU) also tended to follow these patterns, except that gender
differences were not noted and an excess of non-smokers among those
with high P.gingivalis titers were noted (Table I).
Orodigestive cancer mortality was elevated in subjects with peri-
odontal disease, with adjustment for age and sex (RR 5 2.42, 95% CI
5 1.48­3.95), and after additional control for smoking, education,
race/ethnicity and BMI (RR 5 2.28, 95% CI 5 1.17­4.45). There
was also evidence that risks for orodigestive cancer mortality
increased with the severity of periodontal disease (multivariate-
adjusted P trend 5 0.01) (Table II). Subjects with periodontal disease
had excess mortality due to colorectal cancer (deaths 5 39), with
adjustment for age and sex (RR 5 4.34; 95% CI: 1.31­14.44), and
after further adjustment for smoking, education, race/ethnicity
and BMI (RR 5 3.58; 95% CI: 1.15­11.16). Subjects with peri-
odontal disease also tended to have excess risks for pancreas cancer
(deaths 5 18), with adjustment for age and sex (RR 5 4.99; 95%
CI: 1.11­22.5) and following additional adjustment for smoking, educa-
tion, race/ethnicity and BMI (RR 5 4.56; 95% CI: 0.93­22.29). No
excesses were noted for stomach cancer (deaths 5 21), with adjustment
for age and gender (RR 5 1.02; 95% CI: 0.40­2.55) or with the addi-
tional confounders (RR 5 0.99; 95% CI: 0.38­2.58), although statistical
power was limited in the post hoc analysis (,10%). Other sites of
orodigestive cancer had too few deaths for statistical analysis (lip,
oral cavity and pharynx deaths 5 4; esophagus 5 9 and liver 5 14)
(Supplementary Table 1 is available at Carcinogenesis Online).
Participants with high levels of serum antibody to P.gingivalis
(!69.1 EU) also tended to have excess orodigestive cancer mortality
overall (RR 5 3.03; 95% CI: 0.99­9.31) and after exclusion of sub-
jects with clinically apparent periodontal disease (RR 5 2.25, 95% CI
5 1.23­4.14) (Table III). Non-parametric trend analysis for all sub-
jects (Figure 1) showed increasing orodigestive cancer mortality with
increasing P.gingivalis IgG levels, although the dose-response was not
linear, tending to flatten at higher IgG levels.
Discussion
Our investigation in NHANES III, a nationally representative popula-
tion-based cohort study, showed increasing risk for orodigestive cancer
mortality in relation to increasing severity of periodontal disease and in
relation to serum P.gingivalis IgG, a biomarker for exposure to this
periodontitis-related pathogen. The observed associations remained sta-
tistically significant following control for age, sex, smoking, education,
race/ethnicity and BMI. Although numbers were small for cancer site-
specific analyses, clinically defined periodontitis tended to be associ-
ated with colorectal and pancreas cancer in our study.
Several other studies have related cancer risks to periodontal disease
and tooth loss, a generally accepted surrogate marker in adults for
periodontitis (1). In NHANES I, non-significant age- and gender-
adjusted excesses of pancreas cancer were found in subjects with

periodontitis; excesses for colon and stomach cancer were not noted
(15). In a hospital-based case­control study of 14 common cancer types
in Japan (16), self-reported tooth loss was associated with head and neck
(borderline significant) and esophagus cancer. In the Health Professional
Follow-up Study cohort (17,18), self-reported periodontitis was associated
with increased risk for all cancer and for pancreas cancer, whereas tooth
loss was associated with a borderline significant association with all
cancer. Greater tooth loss was associated with excesses of esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cardia and non-cardia adenocarci-
noma, in studies in China (19) and Finland (20), whereas excesses of
pancreas cancer were also reported from the Finnish study (21). Recent
reviews indicate that there is growing evidence of oral health­orodigestive
cancer risk associations, with the strongest evidence for associations
with pancreas cancer (4,5). Farrell et al. (22) recently reported that oral
microbiome profiles significantly differ in pancreatic cancer patients and
controls.
Although several studies are pointing to associations of poor oral
health with increased risk for cancer and other diseases (2­5), our
study is the first to relate a specific oral microbe, P.gingivalis, to
orodigestive cancer. Furthermore, our observation that P.gingivalis
is associated with risk in subjects not exhibiting overt periodontal
disease is a strong indicator that microbial factors play a role in
orodigestive carcinogenesis independent of their association with
periodontal disease. In addition to their role in periodontal disease
and tooth loss, oral bacteria colonize the gut and enter the blood after
mastication, personal oral hygiene and dental procedures (23­27) and
provide source of ligands for toll-like receptors (28), membrane
receptors involved in innate immune regulation by recognition of
pathogen-associated molecular patterns from a wide spectrum of in-
fectious agents. It is also possible that inflammation due to immuno-
logic response to oral bacteria and their toxins (3,29) may play an
important role in oral and gastrointestinal carcinogenesis (30,31).
Alternatively, oral bacteria may be associated with cancer risk by
local metabolism of activating carcinogens from alcohol and smo-
king--risk factors for several orodigestive cancers--and systemic
release of the activated carcinogens, which has been most clearly
demonstrated for alcoholic beverage-associated ethanol metabolism
by oral microbes (32). Finally, oral bacterial profiles could be a marker
of an individual's unmeasured proinflammatory susceptibility related
to inherent genetic and immune system deficiencies.
Our study was limited in that it was based on mortality rather than
incidence and results were derived from small numbers of site-specific
orodigestive cancer deaths, thus we had limited power for evaluation of
mortality risks for specific cancers. Although P.gingivalis is a well-
characterized oral bacteria, serum antibody assessments are indirect
measures for orodigestive bacterial exposure, based on individually

variable vascular exposure and immunologic response. Our study
points to P.gingivalis as a potential etiologic agent, yet we recognize
that this association may be serving as a proxy biomarker for other
pathogenic agents and that definitive conclusions will require direct
microbiome-wide evaluations of oral microbes, as are recently coming
into epidemiologic use (33). Strengths of this study include the pro-
spective design in a nationally representative population, including
ethnic minority groups, a detailed periodontal exam characterizing se-
verity of periodontitis and the availability of pre-diagnostic serum
P.gingivalis IgG levels as a periodontal pathogen biomarker. With these
resources, we were able to evaluate dose-response relationships using
clinic and biomarker-based risk factor measures.
In summary, we found that periodontal disease was associated with
orodigestive cancer mortality and identified P.gingivalis as a specific
and potentially independent microbial marker for risk of orodigestive
cancer death. These findings may reinforce public health recommen-
dations for the maintenance of good oral health as a means of orodi-
gestive cancer prevention and point to the need for microbiome-based
approaches to identify the potentially broad spectrum of microbial
drivers of orodigestive cancer mortality.
