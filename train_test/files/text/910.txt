Background: The American Cancer Society, the National
Cancer Institute (NCI), and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), including the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS), provide the second annual report
to the nation on progress in cancer prevention and control,
with a special section on lung cancer and tobacco smoking.
Methods: Age-adjusted rates (using the 1970 U.S. standard
population) were based on cancer incidence data from NCI
and underlying cause of death data compiled by NCHS. The
prevalence of tobacco use was derived from CDC surveys.
Reported P values are two-sided. Results: From 1990
through 1996, cancer incidence (-0.9% per year; P = .16)
and cancer death (-0.6% per year; P = .001) rates for all
sites combined decreased. Among the 10 leading cancer in-
cidence sites, statistically significant decreases in incidence
rates were seen in males for leukemia and cancers of the
lung, colon/rectum, urinary bladder, and oral cavity and
pharynx. Except for lung cancer, incidence rates for these
cancers also declined in females. Among the 10 leading can-
cer mortality sites, statistically significant decreases in can-
cer death rates were seen for cancers of the male lung, fe-
male breast, the prostate, male pancreas, and male brain
and, for both sexes, cancers of the colon/rectum and stom-
ach. Age-specific analyses of lung cancer revealed that rates
in males first declined at younger ages and then for each
older age group successively over time; rates in females ap-
peared to be in the early stages of following the same pattern,
with rates decreasing for women aged 40­59 years. Conclu-
sions: The declines in cancer incidence and death rates, par-
ticularly for lung cancer, are encouraging. However, unless
recent upward trends in smoking among adolescents can be
reversed, the lung cancer rates that are currently declining
in the United States may rise again. [J Natl Cancer Inst
1999;91:675­90]
On the 25th anniversary of the National Cancer Act in 1996,
the American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), which includes the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) reported the first sustained decline in cancer
mortality since national record-keeping was instituted in the
1930s (1­5). These organizations continue to collaborate, moni-
tor cancer statistics, and produce an annual report to the nation
on progress related to cancer prevention and control in the
United States.
This second report updates and confirms the continuing de-
clines in cancer incidence and death rates in the United States
and presents detailed information on the occurrence of lung
cancer, the leading cause of cancer death, and on tobacco smok-
ing in adults and youth. This report also includes cancer inci-
dence and death rates in five populations: whites, blacks, Asian
and Pacific Islanders, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and
Hispanics.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
All statistics presented in this report are available at the following internet
address:
www-seer.ims.nci.nih.gov
Additional data, such as annual and age-specific rates and trends, are also avail-
able at this address or may be accessed on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results1 (SEER) CD-ROM that may be obtained through the internet ad-
dress.
Cancer Cases
Information on newly diagnosed cancer cases occurring in the United States
is based on data collected by the NCI's SEER Program (5). Briefly, the SEER
Program collects cancer incidence data from 11 population-based registries,
including five states (Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, and Utah) and
six standard metropolitan statistical areas (Atlanta, Detroit, Los Angeles, San
Francisco­Oakland, San Jose­Monterey, and Seattle­Puget Sound), representing
approximately 14% of the U.S. population. Cancer incidence data for Alaska
Natives from Alaska are also included. Estimates of cancer incidence rates and
trends for the total United States are frequently based on SEER data; for this
analysis, we use incident cancer cases diagnosed from 1973 through 1996 (6).
The second edition of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology
(ICDO-2) groupings for the specific cancer sites included in this report have
been published previously (5,6).
Cancer Deaths
Information on cancer deaths in the United States is based on causes of death
reported by the certifying physicians on death certificates filed in state vital
statistics offices. The mortality information is processed and consolidated into a
national database by the NCHS [(7); unpublished data]. The underlying cause of
death is selected for tabulation following the procedures specified by the World

Health Organization in the current Manual of the International Statistical Clas-
sification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death (ICD). For the period from
1950 through 1957, the sixth revision (ICD-6) is used (8); for the period from
1958 through 1967, the seventh revision (ICD-7) is used (9); for the period from
1968 through 1978, the eighth revision (ICDA-8) is used (10); and for the period
from 1979 through 1996, the ninth revision (ICD-9) is used (11). For analyses of
long-term trends in lung cancer death rates during the period from 1950 through
1996, deaths from cancer of the lung and bronchus also include deaths from
cancer of the trachea and pleura. To ensure comparability between the ICDA-8
and ICD-9 codes, ICDA-8 codes on individual records are converted to ICD-9
codes by applying a conversion algorithm used by the NCI, and the ICD-9 codes
are categorized according to SEER site groupings (5).
Cancer Incidence and Death Rates
We use resident population estimates for each year from the U.S. Bureau of
the Census (12) to compute age-adjusted cancer incidence and death rates;
population data for whites are adjusted slightly for an overcount of whites in
Hawaii (Hawaii Department of Public Health: unpublished data). Because in-
formation about Hispanic origin is collected separately from race, persons cat-
egorized as Hispanic are not mutually exclusive from whites, blacks, American
Indians/Alaska Natives, and Asian and Pacific Islanders.
Rates are expressed as per 100 000 population and are age adjusted by the
direct method to the 1970 U.S. standard million population. All rates in this
report are based on at least 25 cases or deaths. For cancer sites that pertain only
to males or females, rates are based on sex-specific data. The term "all sites"
refers to all cancer sites combined, not just to the aggregate of sites included in
each figure. Specific abbreviations include not otherwise specified (NOS) and
intrahepatic bile duct (IBD).
For cancer incidence rates, the denominators are county-level population data
for the geographic areas that participate in the SEER Program. Cancer incidence
rates for American Indians/Alaska Natives are based on data from Alaska plus
all SEER registries.
For cancer death rates, the denominators are population data for the total
United States, except for Hispanic data. Cancer death rates for Hispanics include
cancer deaths that occurred in all states except Connecticut, Louisiana, New
Hampshire, and Oklahoma, which are omitted because of the absence of com-
parable data on Hispanic origin. Cancer death rates for American Indians/Alaska
Natives include data from all states.
Annual Percent Change
The annual percent change (APC) is estimated by fitting a regression line to
the natural logarithm of the rates by use of calendar year as a regressor variable;
i.e., y  mx + b, where y  ln (rate) and x  calendar year. Then, the estimated
APC  100 × (em - 1). Testing the hypothesis that the APC is equal to zero is
equivalent to testing the hypothesis that the slope of the line in the above
equation is equal to zero, i.e., that the rate is not increasing or decreasing. The
hypothesis test statistic uses the t distribution of m/SEm
, where SE is the standard
error of m and the number of degrees of freedom is equal to the number of
calendar years minus 2 (13). The calculation assumes that rates increase or
decrease at a constant rate over time, although the validity of this assumption has
not been assessed. Statistical significance is assessed by use of two-sided
P  .05.
Prevalence of Tobacco Smoking
The prevalence of tobacco smoking is based on data collected by the CDC and
state departments of health and education in three surveys: the National Health
Interview Survey (NHIS), the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS), and the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) (14­18).
NHIS is a continuous nationwide sample survey of the civilian, noninstitution-
alized population that is conducted by NCHS (14). Questions on Hispanic origin
were added to existing questions on race in 1978. From 1992 through 1995,
current cigarette smoking prevalence included persons who reported having
smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and who reported now smoking
every day or on some days. Before 1992, current smokers included persons who
had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and who reported smoking
now.
BRFSS is an ongoing system of surveys conducted by state health departments
in cooperation with the CDC to collect risk factor information and monitor the
effects of interventions over time (15). Every month, each state uses random-
digit-dialing telephone methods to select a probability sample of its civilian,
noninstitutionalized adult population with telephones (15,16). In 1997, all 50
states and the District of Columbia randomly selected a sample of adults aged 18
years and older who had telephones. BRFSS estimates for the total United States
are based on data from 50 states plus the District of Columbia. Of note, BRFSS
estimates presented in this report for the total United States do not agree exactly
with NHIS estimates for the total United States for two reasons: 1) different
survey designs (telephone versus household) and 2) different survey years. Cur-
rent cigarette smoking prevalence includes adults 18 years old and older who had
ever smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and who reported now
smoking every day or on some days.
YRBSS consists of biennial, national, state, and local school-based surveys of
representative samples of high school students (17,18). The national survey uses
a three-stage cluster design, and estimates are weighted to represent students in
grades 9­12 in public and private schools in the 50 states and the District of
Columbia. The state and local surveys involve a two-stage cluster design and are
conducted by state and local education agencies and health departments using
uniform sampling methods but with variable data quality; caution, therefore,
should be used when making direct comparisons of estimates across states and
localities. With an overall response rate of at least 60% and appropriate docu-
mentation for each state and locality, survey data are weighted. In 1997,
weighted estimates from 24 states and 15 cities can be generalized to all public
school students in grades 9­12 in their respective jurisdictions. Data from nine
states and two cities are not weighted and, therefore, apply only to the students
participating in those surveys. Current smoking prevalence includes students in
grades 9­12 who smoked cigarettes on at least one of 30 days preceding the
survey.
RESULTS
Update
SEER cancer incidence. For all cancer sites combined,
SEER incidence rates decreased (-0.9% per year; P  .16) from
1990 through 1996 (Fig.1), although the trend did not achieve
statistical significance. SEER incidence rates appeared to peak
in 1992 and decreased on average -2.2% per year between 1992
and 1996 (P  .001). The incidence rate for males decreased on
average -4.1% per year (P  .001) from the high of 536.4 per
100000 in 1992 to 454.6 per 100000 in 1996. The highest
cancer incidence rate for females occurred in 1991 (351.4 per
100000); between 1991 and 1996, cancer incidence rates for
females declined on average -0.4% per year (P  .079).
Among the 10 leading cancer incidence sites, rates among
males were decreasing for cancers of the prostate, lung, colon/
rectum, urinary bladder, and oral cavity and pharynx and for
leukemia (Fig. 1). From 1990 through 1996, the decreasing
trends were statistically significant for all of these sites except
prostate. Prostate cancer incidence rates peaked in 1992 at 190.8
per 100000 and declined on average -8.5% per year from 1992
through 1996 (P  .007). Trends in male lung cancer are dis-
cussed in more detail in the special section on lung cancer and
tobacco smoking. Colorectal cancer incidence rates in males
began decreasing in the mid-1980s with a peak of 63.0 per
100000 in 1985; rates declined on average -2.0% per year be-
tween 1985 and 1996 (P<.001).
In females, incidence rates decreased for cancers of the colon/
rectum, urinary bladder, and oral cavity and pharynx and for
leukemia from 1990 through 1996 (Fig. 1). However, only the
decreasing trend in colorectal cancer was statistically significant.
Rates of colorectal cancer among females (45.3 per 100 000 in
1985) peaked in the same year as those among males. From 1985
through 1996, colorectal cancer incidence rates decreased on
average -1.8% per year among females (P<.001). Incidence
rates for female breast cancer have remained approximately

level from 1990 through 1996, unlike the
trend of increasing rates that occurred from
1977 through 1987. Trends in female lung
cancer are discussed in the special section on
lung cancer and tobacco smoking.
From 1990 through 1996, incidence rates
for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and melanoma
continued to increase, while the incidence
rate for uterine corpus and uterus NOS can-
cer was approximately level (Fig. 1). Inci-
dence rates for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in-
creased on average +0.6% per year, although
the trend was not statistically significant.
This average annual percent increase was
statistically significantly lower than that ob-
served for the period from 1973 through
1979 (+3.0% per year; P  .001) and for the
1980s (+3.7% per year; P<.001). Trends in
melanoma incidence rates, however, in-
creased substantially from 1990 through
1996 (+2.7% per year; P<.001). The average
APC for the 1990s was not appreciably dif-
ferent from that observed for the 1980s
(+3.1% per year; P<.001) but was substan-
tially lower than the +6.1% increase per year
(P<.001) observed for the period from 1973
through 1979.
The trends in cancer incidence rates var-
ied by sex and age at diagnosis (Fig. 2).
From 1990 through 1996, the largest annual
decreases in incidence rates for all sites com-
bined occurred in males who were 25­44
years old and males who were 75 years old
and older at diagnosis. Age-specific trends in
females were less remarkable, and the largest
and only statistically significant trend was a
decline among those 35­44 years old.
From 1990 through 1996, the four leading
cancer incidence sites for the racial and eth-
nic populations included in this report were
lung and bronchus, prostate, female breast,
and colon/rectum (Fig. 3), which together ac-

count for approximately 54% of all
new diagnoses (19). Examination of
incidence rates for these four sites by
race and ethnicity revealed that, except
for female breast cancer, blacks had
higher incidence rates than the other
racial and ethnic populations. Al-
though cancer of the uterine corpus
and uterus NOS was common to all
five racial and ethnic groups among
the top 10 incidence sites, some sites
tended to be unique to a specific popu-
lation. For example, melanoma and
leukemia were among the top 10 inci-
dence sites only in whites, cancers of
the pancreas and oral cavity and phar-
ynx were among the top 10 sites only
in blacks, liver cancer was among the
top 10 sites only in Asian and Pacific
Islanders and American Indians/
Alaska Natives, cancer of the kidney
and renal pelvis was among the top 10
sites only in American Indians/Alaska
Natives, and bladder cancer was
among the top 10 sites only in whites
and Hispanics.
U.S. cancer mortality. From 1990
through 1996, cancer death rates for all
sites combined decreased (-0.6% per
year; P  .001) (Fig. 4). Cancer death
rates peaked in 1991 at 173.4 per
100000 and, from 1991 through 1996,
decreased statistically significantly on
average -0.7% per year (P  .002).
Male cancer death rates peaked in
1990 at 220.8 per 100 000, and female
death rates peaked 1 year later at 142.2
per 100 000. The decreasing trends
from the peak years were on average
-1.0% per year from 1990 through
1996 for males and -0.4% per year
from 1991 through 1996 for females.
Cancer death rates were decreasing for
all 10 leading cancer mortality sites,
except for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
and female lung cancer. From 1990
through 1996, non-Hodgkin's lym-

phoma death rates continued to increase
(+1.8% per year; P  .001) but at a slower
pace than in the 1980s (+2.4% per year;
P<.001). A lower annual percent increase
in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma death rates
occurred entirely among males; more
specifically, the average APC from 1990
through 1996 among males (+1.5% per
year) was statistically significantly lower
than the average APC during the 1980s
(+2.7% per year). In contrast, the average
APC among females was +2.0% per year for
both time periods. Trends in lung cancer
death rates are discussed in detail in the spe-
cial section on lung cancer and tobacco
smoking.
From 1990 through 1996, statistically sig-
nificant declines in cancer death rates among
males were observed for cancers of the lung,
colon/rectum, prostate, pancreas, stomach,
and brain and other nervous system. Prostate
cancer death rates peaked in 1991 at 26.7 per
100000; rates decreased significantly on av-
erage -2.1% per year from 1991 through
1996. Colorectal cancer death rates in males
peaked in 1978 and declined statistically sig-
nificantly on average -1.3% per year from
then through 1996.
Statistically significant declines in female
cancer death rates were observed during the
1990s for cancers of the colon/rectum,
breast, and stomach. Colorectal cancer death
rates in females have been declining since
the late 1940s (19). Breast cancer death rates
were approximately stable from the 1950s to
1989 when rates began to decline. From
1989 through 1996, breast cancer death rates
decreased statistically significantly on aver-
age -1.7% per year.
Trends in cancer death rates varied by sex
and age. From 1990 through 1996, the aver-
age APC in cancer death rates was statisti-
cally significantly decreasing for males of all
ages except for those who were at least 85
years old at death (Fig. 5). Unlike trends

among males, trends among females were statistically signifi-
cantly decreasing only for those who were younger than age 65
(Fig. 5). The only exceptions were females aged 25­34 years at
death, whose cancer death rate was declining--but the decline
did not achieve statistical significance--and females aged 65
years and older, whose cancer death rates were increasing.
More than half of all cancer deaths involved cancers of the
lung, female breast, prostate, or colon and rectum (19). The top
four causes of cancer death in the United States from 1990
through 1996 for the racial and ethnic groups included in this
report, except Asian and Pacific Islanders, involved the same
sites as for incidence (Fig. 3). Among Asian and Pacific Island-
ers, cancer of the liver and IBD, instead of female breast cancer,
ranked among the four leading causes of cancer death. Exami-
nation of cancer death rates for each of these sites by race
and ethnicity revealed that blacks had higher cancer death rates
than whites, Asian and Pacific Islanders, American Indians/
Alaska Natives, or Hispanics. Among the leading cancer mor-
tality sites, deaths due to leukemia and to cancers of the stomach
and ovary were common to all five racial and ethnic groups (data
not shown). Otherwise, the leading cancer mortality sites varied
by racial and ethnic groups. For example, brain and other ner-
vous system cancers were among the leading cancer mortality
sites only in whites (data not shown), esophageal cancer and

Special Section on Lung Cancer and Tobacco Smoking
Lung cancer incidence and mortality. The lung is the num-
ber 1 cancer mortality site overall and is one of the top four
incidence sites for each racial and ethnic group (Fig. 3). The
incidence rates from 1990 through 1996 varied widely by race
and ethnicity, from a high of 73.9 per 100 000 among blacks to
27.6 per 100 000 among Hispanics (Fig. 3). While the overall
rate for American Indians/Alaska Natives is also low (29.7 per
100000), it obscures the wide range in rates by geographic area
from a low of 10.3 per 100 000 among American Indians in New
Mexico to a high of 76.4 per 100 000 among American Indians/
Alaska Natives in Alaska (data not shown), which is even higher
than the rate for blacks.
From 1990 through 1996, the declines in male lung cancer
incidence and death rates were statistically significant (on aver-
age -2.6% and -1.6% per year, respectively) (Figs. 1 and 4).
Male lung cancer incidence rates peaked in 1984 (86.5 per
100000) and decreased on average -1.4% per year from 1984
through 1996 (P<.001). Male lung cancer death rates peaked in
1990 at 75.2 per 100 000. From 1994 through 1996, male lung
cancer incidence and death rates were lower than in the period
from 1991 through 1993 for all age groups (Figs. 6 and 7) and
all histologic types (Fig. 8).
Further analyses by age revealed that, historically, lung can-
cer incidence rates initially began to decline in men diagnosed
before age 50 years and then peaked and declined for each older
age group in succession over time (Figs. 6 and 7). The earliest
declines in male lung cancer incidence rates occurred among
men diagnosed at ages 20­49 years in the mid- to late 1970s.
Lung cancer incidence rates peaked in the period from 1979
through 1981 for males 50­59 years old at diagnosis, in the
mid-1980s for males 60­79 years old, and in the early 1990s for
males 80 years old and older. Age-specific death rates for male
lung cancer followed temporal patterns similar to those for in-
cidence, but peak years generally occurred later than for inci-
dence (Fig. 7).
Declines by histologic type in males were also remarkable
(Fig. 8). Large declines occurred among men who had squamous
cell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma, the histologic types
most strongly associated with cigarette smoking (20,21). The
rates for these histologic types have been decreasing since the
early to mid-1980s for both black and white males (Fig. 8).
Similarly, large-cell lung carcinoma has been decreasing among
white males since the mid-1980s and among black males more
recently (Fig. 8). Finally, rates of adenocarcinoma of the lung,
which may be associated with using so-called "low tar" ciga-
rettes (22,23), may have peaked in the early 1990s in males (Fig.
8). When these histology-specific trends over time were exam-
ined separately for men younger and older than age 65 years, the
decreases were most pronounced among the younger men for all
histologic types.
From 1990 through 1996, male lung cancer rates were de-
creasing in all racial and ethnic groups except American Indians/
Alaska Natives (Fig. 9). The decreases in incidence rates were
statistically significant for white and Hispanic males, and the
decreases in death rates were statistically significant for white,
black, and Hispanic males.
In contrast, overall female lung cancer incidence and death
rates were increasing throughout the study period (Figs. 6 and 7).
From 1990 through 1996, the average annual percent increase
was +0.1% per year for incidence (P  .70) and +1.4% per year for
mortality (P < .001) (Figs. 1 and 4). The average APC in female
lung cancer incidence rates has slowed in recent years, and rates
may have peaked in 1994 at 43.4 per 100000. From 1994 through
1996, female lung cancer incidence rates appeared to be decreasing
on average -1.3% per year, although this trend was not statistically
significant. Female lung cancer death rates did not follow this same
pattern.

We further examined female lung cancer inci-
dence and death rates by age to assess whether, his-
torically, the age-specific patterns of declines seen
for males were beginning to occur in females. A
downturn in female lung cancer incidence rates was
most apparent for women aged 40­49 years and 50­
59 years; incidence rates for these age groups
peaked in the mid-1970s and late 1980s, respec-
tively. From 1990 through 1996, incidence rates for
women aged 60­69 years old were approximately
level; for older women, they continued to increase
(Fig. 6). Age-specific patterns of female lung cancer
death rates were similar (Fig. 7).
Analyses of female lung cancer incidence by his-
tologic type revealed that rates of squamous cell
lung cancer have been approximately level since the
mid-1980s, rates of small-cell lung cancer decreased from 1991
through 1996, rates of adenocarcinoma of the lung continued to
increase (although the rate of increase may be slowing), and
rates of large-cell lung cancer have been decreasing since the
late 1980s (Fig. 8). The histologic patterns of disease were simi-
lar for both white and black women over time. Like the histol-
ogy-specific trends over time in males, all decreases were more
pronounced among women younger than age 65 years than
among older women.
Finally, we examined trends in female lung cancer by race
and ethnicity. From 1990 through 1996, incidence rates ap-
peared to be level among white and Asian and Pacific Islander
females and declining in the other racial and ethnic groups (Fig.
9); the only statistically significant decreasing trend was among
Hispanic females (-3.2% per year). From 1990 through 1996,
lung cancer death rates were statistically significantly increasing
for white, black, and American Indian/Alaska Native females
(Fig. 9).
Tobacco smoking. According to the 1995 NHIS, about 47
million adults (24.7%) were current smokers in the United
States, either daily (20.1%) or on some days (4.6%) (14). Men
(27.0%) were more likely to smoke currently than women
(22.6%); among racial and ethnic groups, American Indians/
Alaska Natives had the highest prevalence (36.2%) and Asian
and Pacific Islanders the lowest (16.6%). Smoking prevalence
varied eightfold among females (from 4.3% among Asian and
Pacific Islanders to 35.4% among American Indians/Alaska Na-
tives) and less than twofold among males (from 21.7% among
Hispanics to 37.3% among American Indians/Alaska Natives).
The prevalence of current smoking varied inversely with edu-
cation; high school dropouts had the highest prevalence (41.9%
and 33.7% among males and females, respectively), and college
graduates had the lowest (14.3% and 13.7% among males and
females, respectively).
Although the prevalence of current cigarette use generally
decreased over more than 30 years, the pattern of declines varied
by sex and by race and ethnicity (24). From 1965 to 1985,
smoking prevalence declined more rapidly among males than
among females; rates in males decreased from 51.9% to 32.6%
and in females from 33.9% to 27.9%. From 1985 to 1995, the
rate of decline was similar for both sexes; the rate in males
decreased from 32.6% to 27.0% and in females from 27.9% to
22.6%. From 1978 through 1995, smoking prevalence declined
among blacks, Asians and Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, and
whites (Fig. 10) (25), although the rate of decline appeared to
slow in the 1990s. In contrast, smoking prevalence among
American Indians/Alaska Natives did not change appreciably in
males from 1983 through 1995 or in females from 1978 through
1995.
Trend analyses from the national YRBSS indicate that ciga-
rette smoking prevalence among high school students in the
United States increased statistically significantly from 27.5% in
1991 to 36.4% in 1997 (17,18). Prevalence increased from
30.9% to 39.7% among white students, from 12.6% to 22.7%
among black students, and from 25.3% to 34.0% among His-
panic students. In 1997, the prevalence of current cigar use was
22.0%, and the overall prevalence of any use of cigarettes, ci-
gars, or smokeless tobacco was 42.7%.
State-specific lung cancer mortality and tobacco smoking.
Lung cancer death rates varied widely by state (Table 1). From
1990 through 1996, Kentucky experienced the highest lung can-
cer death rate for males (103.4 per 100000), while Nevada had

the highest death rate for females (45.8 per
100000) in the United States. Utah had the lowest
lung cancer death rates for both sexes (31.5 per
100000 among males and 13.9 per 100 000 among
females). Lung cancer death rates in males greatly
exceeded those in females in all states. From 1990
through 1996, male lung cancer death rates were
decreasing in most states, with the largest statisti-
cally significant decrease occurring among males
in Colorado. Exceptions to the decreasing rates
among males occurred in Idaho, Kentucky, and
South Dakota; the trends of increasing rates in
these three states were not statistically significant.
In contrast, female lung cancer death rates were
increasing in most states during the same time pe-
riod, with the largest statistically significant in-
crease occurring in Rhode Island. Only Arizona,
California, and Hawaii experienced any decrease
in lung cancer death rates among females during
this period, and none of these trends was statisti-
cally significant.
The prevalence of current smoking among
adults in the United States also varied by state
(Table 2) (15). In 1997, Kentucky experienced the
highest current smoking prevalence in the United
States for adult males (33.1%), while Nevada had
the highest smoking rates for adult females (29.8%). Utah had
the lowest adult smoking rates for males (16.1%) and females
(11.5%).
Cigarette use in the 30 days preceding the survey among
youth also varied among the states and localities in the United
States that provided data (Table 2). In 1997, the prevalence of
current smoking among high school students was highest in
Kentucky (48.4% for male students and 45.3% for female stu-
dents) and lowest in Utah (17.4% for male students and 15.0%
for female students).
DISCUSSION
SEER Cancer Incidence and U.S. Cancer Mortality
This report confirms continuing declines in cancer incidence
and cancer death rates during the 1990s. The decreases in inci-
dence rates were greatest among males and occurred in most of
the top 10 incidence sites; exceptions were cancer of the female
breast, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, melanoma, and cancer of the
corpus and uterus NOS. Rates for most of the leading cancer
mortality sites were declining; exceptions were cancer of the
female lung and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Decreases in cancer
death rates were statistically significant among males for all age
groups under the age of 85 years. Among females, cancer death
rates were significantly decreasing for women younger than age
65 years but were significantly increasing for women aged 75
years and older. The possible reasons for these decreases have
been described previously (4), although some concerns about the
completeness of case ascertainment persist, particularly for
melanoma and prostate cancer, which are frequently diagnosed
in out-of-hospital settings, and for cancers diagnosed through
pathology reviews that are conducted out of state instead of
within the hospital.
Our study reports cancer incidence and mortality statistics
separately for white, black, Asian and Pacific Islander, Ameri-
can Indian/Alaska Native, and Hispanic populations. However,
we did not address the occurrence of cancer in rural populations,
in populations of low socioeconomic status or low education, or
in populations with limited access to health care. Our inclusion
of cancer incidence statistics for American Indian/Alaska Native
populations is based primarily on residents of New Mexico and
Alaska. Cancer rates vary considerably among American Indian
(26) and Alaska Native (27) populations. Alaska Natives, for
example, have the highest cancer death rates of all populations
served by the Indian Health Service. Lung cancer incidence rates
in Alaska Natives have increased substantially since the 1960s
and show no evidence of slowing, particularly when smoking
behaviors are taken into consideration (28). Between 42% and
46% of Alaska Native men were smoking compared with 26%­
27% of non-Alaska Native men; the comparable smoking per-
centages for Alaska Native and non-Alaska Native women were
36% and 23%, respectively (29).
Continued higher incidence and death rates among some ra-
cial and ethnic groups may be an indication that some popula-
tions have not benefited equally from cancer prevention and
control efforts. Such disparities may be due to multiple factors,
such as late stage of disease at diagnosis, barriers to health care
access, a history of other diseases, biologic and genetic differ-

ences in tumors, health behaviors, and the presence of risk fac-
tors. A commitment to reducing morbidity and mortality from
cancer in the United States will require concomitant dedication
to bridging racial and ethnic disparities related to cancer inci-
dence and mortality. In the future, expanded study of special
populations should be possible through analyses of data aggre-
gated for the North American Association of Central Cancer
Registries (30). As the number of state cancer registries that
contribute data to the North American Association of Central
Cancer Registries increases and the quality of registry data im-
proves, more representative data (e.g., Native American and
other racial and ethnic populations and populations in the South-
eastern United States, Appalachia, and other geographic loca-
tions) should become available.
Limitations of Cancer Incidence and Mortality Data
For the primary analyses, we estimated APC statistics for the
1990s. Because these statistics were computed over the time
interval from 1990 through 1996, the assumption that rates in-
creased or decreased at a constant rate over time did not apply to
both sexes, all sites, or all populations analyzed. There are two
issues here: the peak year and whether or not the data are linear

throughout the time interval. First, we were unable to choose a
single year as the downturn year for the different groups in-
cluded in the analyses because the peak year differed across
groups. For example, female incidence and mortality rates for all
sites combined peaked in 1991. By comparison, mortality rates
in males peaked in 1990 and incidence rates in 1992. To address
the concerns about the linear increase or decrease over time, we
also provided trend analyses based on the peak years for the
major cancers. Although this approach may have satisfied the
required statistical assumptions for these sites, direct compari-
sons of trends involving different peak years are inappropriate.
Second, because the estimated APC statistics based on the time
interval from 1990 through 1996 were not linear for all analysis
groups, the statistical significance of the t test for the beta co-
efficient may be overstated or understated. There is also some
random variation in rates across years. However, trends based on
the period from 1990 through 1996 may be compared across the
cancer sites, sexes, racial and ethnic populations, and other
groups as necessary.
Assessments of the absolute and comparative levels of cancer
incidence and death rates by race and ethnicity need to be tem-
pered by the recognition of potential year-to-year random varia-
tion in the rates and biases in the basic data. First, the listing of
the top 10 sites (Fig. 3) may vary from year to year because of
small random differences in rates across sites for a specific racial
or ethnic population, particularly for Native Americans. For ex-
ample, the rate and SE of the incidence rate for all sites com-
bined for American Indians/Alaska Natives are 194.9 per
100000 (SE  3.2) compared with 402.9 per 100 000 (SE 
0.4) for whites. Second, biases result from misreporting race and
ethnicity and, to a lesser extent, age on the basic records used to
collect information on cancer incidence, mortality, and the popu-
lation at risk (31­34). Rates may be biased because of misre-
porting on death certificates (31) and hospital medical records,
which comprise the numerators of the cancer death and inci-
dence rates, respectively, and on censuses and surveys, which
comprise the denominators of the rates. Evaluation studies
(32,34) suggest that the reporting of race for the white and black
population is generally reliable. However, biases are serious for
the smaller populations, particularly for American Indians
(32,34). While these biases affect comparisons among groups at
a specified point in time, the trend data for both morbidity and
mortality are considered to be relatively reliable.
Lung Cancer and Tobacco Smoking
As much as 90% of all lung cancer is caused by tobacco
smoking, including active cigarette smoking, pipe and cigar
smoking, and exposure to second-hand smoke (35,36). Other
factors, such as exposure to radon and asbestos, also increase
risk (37). The epidemic of lung cancer in this century largely
reflects birth cohort patterns of active cigarette smoking (38,39).
At the turn of the century, lung cancer was a rare disease (40,41).
To understand the evolution of the epidemic of lung cancer in
this country, one must understand the time during which manu-
factured cigarettes were introduced, the successive increases in
cigarette smoking by generations of first men and then women,
and the 20- to 50-year delay between the uptake of regular
smoking and the occurrence of lung cancer (39).
The large increase in the consumption of manufactured ciga-
rettes during the first half of the 20th century is best reflected in
population consumption data. Per capita consumption increased
from approximately 54 cigarettes per adult in 1900 (42,43) to a
peak of 4345 cigarettes per adult in 1963 (42,44). Cigarettes
were an uncommon form of tobacco use early in the century. Of
the nearly 7.5 pounds of tobacco consumed per adult in 1900,
only 0.16 pound (about 2%) was consumed in the form of mass-
produced cigarettes. Factors that contributed to increased con-
sumption of manufactured cigarettes included the introduction
of cigarettes blended from flue-cured tobaccos (which facilitated
inhalation into the lungs and more efficient absorption of nico-
tine) (45), such as Camel in 1913, advertising, and a more effi-
cient marketing and distribution network, including the free dis-
tribution of cigarettes in World War I and World War II (44,45).
The uptake in cigarette smoking occurred first among men
and later among women and then for several decades followed a
generational pattern in which successive birth cohorts began
smoking at progressively younger ages with a larger proportion
of adults becoming smokers (44). Among men born from 1895
through World War II, between 70% and 80% were cigarette
smokers some time during their lifetime, and many smoked
heavily. In contrast, few women born before 1900 became heavy
cigarette smokers, and only about 10%­20% reported ever
smoking. The prevalence of smoking in women lagged behind
men and reached the peak of 55% in the cohort of women born
from 1935 through 1944. In addition, among older birth cohorts,
men and women differed substantially by the age at which they

started to smoke. For example, among women born prior to
1900, the mean age of initiation was well over age 30 years (46).
Almost all birth cohorts of males and younger birth cohorts of
females began smoking before age 20 years, although the ma-
jority of females who started smoking as teenagers began smok-
ing after World War II.
Because experimentation with cigarette smoking and nicotine
addiction usually occurs in adolescence or during early adult-
hood, patterns of smoking behaviors tend to persist as a birth
cohort ages. This accounts for the clear birth cohort progression
in smoking prevalence and the progression in age-specific lung
cancer incidence and death rates 20­50 years later. The patterns
of declining lung cancer in males and the leveling off and pos-
sible future decline in females as reported in this analysis reflect
historical patterns of cigarette smoking, as did the age- and
sex-specific increases in lung cancer observed earlier in this
century (38,39).
Several current trends in tobacco smoking, if unchecked, will
worsen the future occurrence of lung cancer. First, the number of
adults currently smoking cigarettes in the United States (47 mil-
lion) remains high (14), and adult prevalence has changed little
from 1993 to 1997 (14,47). Second, increasing trends in tobacco
smoking among adolescents during the 1990s can only be con-
sidered alarming (18,48,49), although data collected in 1998
suggest that prevalence may be declining slightly (48). Finally,
cigar consumption (mainly large cigars) increased by about 50%
from 1993 to 1997, reversing an almost 20-year decline (50).
Cigar use has regained acceptance among better-educated, up-
per-income men and women, especially among those 18­34
years old who previously had eschewed cigarettes (24,50); in
1997, about one in five high school students smoked cigars (18).
Cigar smoking can cause lung cancer, as well as oral, esopha-
geal, and laryngeal cancers (50­52).
Limitations of Data on Tobacco Smoking
Prevalence estimates of tobacco smoking in adults may have
some limitations. Because interviews are conducted by tele-
phone in BRFSS, the estimates of adult tobacco smoking can be
generalized only to the population of persons with telephones.
However, a recent analysis of NHIS data (53) compared re-
sponses regarding health risk behaviors from households with
telephones with responses from all households in the survey. In
1992, the difference in the prevalence of current cigarette smok-
ers for respondents from all households compared with respon-
dents from telephone households was small (25.4% versus
24.4%, respectively). Another study compared estimates of adult
smoking prevalence from BRFSS with personal interviews from
the Bureau of the Census Current Population Survey (54) that
has collected data on smoking prevalence for all 50 states and
the District of Columbia in the years 1985, 1989, 1993, and 1996
(55,56). In general, findings from the two surveys were similar,
although differences were more pronounced in findings for
males and blacks and also for Southern states where telephone
coverage was lower (54). In 1990, according to the U.S. Bureau
of the Census (57), telephones were present in the homes of 96%
of whites, 87% of blacks, 98% of Asians and Pacific Islanders,
77% of American Indians, Eskimos, or Aleuts, and 88% of His-
panics. Differences in telephone coverage are relevant, since
cigarette smoking prevalence may be higher in persons from
homes without telephones than in persons from homes with
telephones (58).
Prevalence estimates for tobacco smoking in youth from
YRBSS also have limitations. Because state surveys are con-
ducted among public high school students, the estimates can be
generalized only to youth attending public school in the respec-
tive jurisdictions (17). Compared with those enrolled in school,
youth who are not in school have higher rates of tobacco use
(59). However, in 1996, only 6% of persons aged 16­17 years
were not enrolled in a high school program and had not com-
pleted high school (60).
Tobacco Advertising
The tobacco industry has a long history of targeting market-
ing campaigns to selected groups in the U.S population and
abroad. The earliest cigarette-marketing practices were directed
at men; however, by 1928, advertising campaigns targeted
women, often with themes linking cigarette smoking to weight
control (44). In 1996, the cigarette industry spent $5.1 billion on
advertising and promoting its products to virtually all segments
of society (61). Special target populations include women
(44,62­64), racial and ethnic populations (25,62,65), and blue-
collar workers (62). Adolescents are especially susceptible to
cigarette marketing (59,62,66­69). Brands that are popular
among adolescents are more likely than adult brands to be ad-
vertised in magazines with high youth readership (70).
Cigarette companies have also appealed to health-conscious
smokers with so-called "low tar" brand cigarettes (71). Tar,
nicotine, and carbon monoxide levels in U.S. cigarettes have
been determined by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
since the mid-1960s and are derived from a fixed, machine-
based testing protocol. The FTC testing method, however, does
not take into account how smokers adjust their smoking patterns
to obtain nicotine from cigarettes. To get their required level of
nicotine, smokers of low tar and low nicotine cigarettes tend to
take more and longer puffs per cigarette, inhale more deeply, and
block ventilation holes on the filters, which thereby negates the
reason for their switching to low tar brands (71). The increased
promotion of cigarettes yielding 15 mg tar or less (as measured
by the FTC method) was followed by an increased U.S. market
share of these products (61,62) from 3.6% of all cigarettes sold
in 1970 to 44.8% by 1980 (71) and 72.7% in 1995 (61). Recent
studies suggest that smokers' perceptions of tar yields may be
influenced by misleading advertising terms such as "light" and
"ultra-light" (72) and that mistaken beliefs about low tar brands
may reduce intentions to quit (71,73). Following the shift to
lower tar cigarettes, there was a parallel increase in adenocarci-
noma of the lung, which has now become the most common lung
cancer type in the United States (22,23). The U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, in collaboration with the FTC, is
currently conducting a review of the FTC's testing methods.
Strategies for the Future
Trends of decreasing incidence and death rates for the leading
cancer sites are encouraging. However, to meet national goals
for reducing the morbidity and mortality due to cancer (74,75),
increased efforts are needed to identify additional cancer pre-
vention and control strategies, to implement more completely
the interventions that have worked well in the past, and to reach
all segments of society.
Because lung cancer accounts for approximately 14% of new
cancer cases and 28% of cancer deaths each year (19), the largest
impact can be made through programs and policies that deter

smoking initiation, promote cessation, and protect nonsmokers
from environmental tobacco smoke (36,76­80). Efforts to pre-
vent initiation include 1) reducing minors' access to and the
appeal of tobacco products, 2) widely disseminating effective
school-based tobacco use prevention curricula, which would op-
timally be combined with community- and media-based strate-
gies, and 3) increasing the support and involvement of parents
(49,59,81). Raising the cost of tobacco products can also reduce
initiation and promote quitting (36,59,82). In addition, using
excise taxes to finance community interventions and mass-
media strategies can be especially effective in reducing con-
sumption, as demonstrated in California and Massachusetts
(77,83­85). The widespread dissemination of proven quitting
strategies, including reimbursement for safe and effective thera-
pies on the part of health care insurers and managed care orga-
nizations, can also facilitate quitting (79,80,86). Smoke-free
laws and policies protect people from the toxic and carcinogenic
chemicals in environmental tobacco smoke and also establish
smoke-free air as the norm (87­89). Health professionals need to
continue to monitor the patterns, determinants, and conse-
quences of tobacco use. Increased awareness of the activities of
tobacco product manufacturers (e.g., product innovations and
marketing practices) and related environmental influences (e.g.,
economics, policy and legislation, and social norms) are needed
to facilitate appropriate public health actions. Finally, new ad-
vances in genetics may lead to a better understanding of tobacco
addiction and ultimately to more effective cessation strategies.
The rapid increase in cigarette smoking that occurred during
the first half of this century was responsible for the epidemic of
lung and other tobacco-related cancer deaths in the last half of
the century, first among men and a generation later among
women. Male lung cancer deaths and death rates are now de-
clining, and recent data for women show a slowing in the rate of
increase, suggesting an eventual decline in their lung cancer rate
as well. While these data are extremely encouraging, several
notes of caution are in order. Lung cancer is almost exclusively
a smoker's disease, and both incidence and mortality are directly
related to the degree of cigarette use that occurs in a population.
However, the leveling off of tobacco smoking in the 1990s
among adults, the alarming trends among teens, and the in-
creased popularity of cigar use may contribute to higher preva-
lence of long-term smoking among adults in the future. Specifi-
cally, unless steps are taken now to lower adolescent initiation
rates dramatically, the current positive trends in lung cancer
could reverse, and future cohorts could again experience a rise in
lung cancer.

NOTES
1Editor's note: SEER is a set of geographically defined, population-based
central tumor registries in the United States, operated by local nonprofit orga-
nizations under contract to the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Each registry
annually submits its cases to the NCI on a computer tape. These computer tapes
are then edited by the NCI and made available for analysis.
