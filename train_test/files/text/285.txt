Increasing Rates of Dementia at Time of Declining Mortality
From Stroke
Svetlana Ukraintseva, PhD; Frank Sloan, PhD; Konstantin Arbeev, PhD; Anatoly Yashin, PhD
Background and Purpose--Stroke is associated with increased risk of dementia. There has been a decline in mortality
from stroke among persons 65 and over in recent decades in the US. It is not clear, however, how this process has
affected incidence of various dementias.
Methods--We evaluated over time changes in stroke admission rates and survival, and in rates of newly diagnosed
dementias (Alzheimer disease, senile, and cerebrovascular disease­related dementia) in persons with and without stroke
aged 65 and over, using Medicare inpatient records, 1984 to 2001, linked to the National Long-Term Care Survey (about
380 000 person-years totally).
Results--Age-adjusted stroke rate increased from 0.0066 to 0.008 (P0.08) from 1984­1990 to 1991­2001. One-year
survival after stroke improved from 53% in 1984 to 1990 to 65% in 1991 to 1996 (P0.0001). Age-standardized rate
of diagnosed dementias increased from 0.0062 in 1984 to 1990 to 0.0095 in 1991 to 2000 (P0.001). Among stroke
patients the rate rose from 0.043 to 0.080. The relative increase in risk was largest for cerebrovascular disease­related
dementia (3.68). For senile dementia, the increase was small and not significant. Rates of dementia among persons
without stroke rose mainly attributable to Alzheimer disease.
Conclusions--Mortality from stroke declined mainly because of declining stroke case-fatality. In parallel, the rate of
diagnosed dementia increased. The increase was larger for persons with stroke compared with stroke-free population.
Improved survival from stroke may contribute to this trend. Other contributing factors may include better diagnostics,
an increased propensity to make the diagnosis, and increasing dementia risk attributable to factors other than stroke.

Stroke is associated with an excess risk of dementia.
Epidemiological studies suggest a several-fold increased
incidence of various dementias after stroke.1­4 About 700 000
persons in the US experienced a new or recurrent stroke
during 2002.5 The large number of strokes, taken in combi-
nation with the association of stroke and dementia onset, implies
that stroke-related dementia is a major public health issue.
Since the 1980s, there has been an almost 2-fold decline in
mortality from stroke among persons aged 65 and older in the
US.6 This decline could have occurred from a decline in
stroke incidence, or case-fatality rates, or both. Only a few
studies have documented changes over time in stroke inci-
dence and patients' survival, and recent trends are not quite
clear. A decline in stroke incidence rate has been recorded in
several European countries.7­10 There are limited data dem-
onstrating a similar decline among Americans aged 70 years
and older, in particular before the 1990s.11­12 Case-fatality
rate from stroke declined from 12% to 7% to 8% in the US,
during in-hospital stay among patients aged 65 and over
between 1982 to 1996.13 A modest improvement in poststroke
survival from 1985 to 1989 was observed in a study using
Medicare hospital claim records.14 Some European studies
have recorded declining case-fatality rates for stroke (at least
in women).10,15 In several other European studies, case-
fatality did not change significantly over time, so that authors
have attributed the decline in stroke mortality to a reduction
in the incidence rather than in the case-fatality rate.9,11
Although decreasing stroke incidence per se should reduce
the number of new cases of dementia, the effect of improved
survival from stroke is less clear. On the one hand, some
factors associated with improved survival (eg, better differ-
ential diagnostics of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke or
better treatment of stroke consequences) could potentially
reduce the risk of poststroke dementia. On the other hand,
improved survival from stroke could increase the proportion
of stroke survivors with more severe brain injury (who would
have died previously), which might cause an increase in
dementia risks after stroke.
In this article, we examine the age patterns and time trends
in stroke rates during 1984 to 2001, survival after the stroke,

and the rates of newly diagnosed dementias (developed after
stroke as well as in stroke-free population), using data from
Medicare Part A inpatient claims linked to the National
Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) participants. We address
the following question: How did the declining trend in
mortality from stroke affect rates of various diagnosed
dementias in the US elderly in recent decades?
Materials and Methods
Subjects
The NLTCS is a survey designed to measure health status, functional
limitations, disability, and the use of long-term care among the
elderly Americans. It contains longitudinal and cross-sectional data
on a nationally representative sample of 41 947 US elderly persons
(from Medicare enrollees) who were aged 65 years at enrollment.
The surveys were conducted in 1982, 1984, 1989, 1994, and 1999,
with 17 000 to 20 000 age-eligible survivors at each of 5 rounds. At
the time of each new survey, a cohort sample of about 5000 persons
passing their 65th birthday in the prior 5 years was added to the
surviving sample to replace the deaths occurring since the prior
survey and to ensure that the new sample was representative of the
entire elderly population aged 65 and over in the respective year. In
total, there are 17 250 males (41%), 24 697 females (59%), 38 011
whites (91%), 3152 blacks (8%) and 784 persons of other race (2%)
in all 5 waves of the NLTCS.
Each NLTCS participant is linked to Medicare records, containing
information on Part A and B claims. Part A refers to the Medicare
insurance program that covers inpatient hospital care, posthospital
skilled nursing care, home health services, and hospice care for aged
and disabled individuals who meet the eligibility requirements. Part
B pays for physicians' services, outpatient hospital care, durable
medical equipment, and some medical services that are not covered
by Part A (for more information see: http://www.medicare.gov/;
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/). Diagnostic information was not available
on Part B records until 1991. The quality of information for Part A
inpatient (IP) claims was sufficient for the entire study period
(1984­2001). That is, only 0.18% of IP records contained missing
data on ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes in 1984, and 0.1% of records
contained the missing data in the other years. Hence, in our study we
only used IP claims to obtain the information on diagnoses assigned
to the NLTCS participants during hospital stay. In total, about
380 000 person-years were represented in our data (supplemental
Tables I and II, available online at http://stroke.ahajournals.org).
We did not use sample weights in our analyses. The weights were
available for the years 1982, 1984, 1989, 1994, and 1999. However,
the weights were not available for the years between the surveys. In
our study, we had to calculate the rates of Medicare diagnoses for
each of the years between 1984 and 2001. Therefore, for consistency
of estimates through the entire study interval (1984­2001), we did
not use sample weights and calculated nonweighted rates for each
study year.
Diagnoses of Stroke and Dementia
We used the ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes (downloaded from ftp://
ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Publications/ICD9-CM/
2003). The history of changes in ICD-9-CM codes was tracked to
evaluate possible influences on the analyses of data using "Conver-
sion Table of New ICD-9-CM Codes, October 2004" (downloaded
from http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/icd9/icdcnv05.pdf). There was
only 1 change in ICD-9-CM codes that could affect our analyses.
The code 438.0 (Cerebrovascular disease­related cognitive deficit)
was introduced on 10/01/1997. Before then, this diagnosis was
represented by a combination of 2 codes: 294.9 & 438. Two
individuals in our database had such a combination before 10/01/1997.
They were counted as diagnosed with cerebrovascular disease­related
dementia (CBVD) and were included in calculations of respective rates.
The stroke sample consisted of persons with a principal ICD-
9-CM diagnosis of stroke (436), acute intracranial hemorrhage (431),
or iatrogenic cerebrovascular infarction or hemorrhage/postoperative
stroke (997.02). We considered 3 groups of individuals with newly
diagnosed dementia, according to the ICD-9-CM codes: (1) Alzhei-
mer disease (AD)-331.0 (Alzheimer disease) or 290.1 (Presenile
dementia) codes; (2) CBVD-290.4 (Vascular dementia: multi-
infarct, arteriosclerotic dementia) or 438.0 (cerebrovascular disease­
related cognitive deficit) codes; and (3) Senile Dementia-290.0,
290.2, 290.3, 290.8, 290.9, 331.2, or 310.1 codes. The latter group
represents various cases of senility with mental deterioration. We
computed dementia rates for these groups defining them to be
mutually exclusive diagnoses. That is, if the person had an AD, she
or he was assigned to the AD group, regardless of possible presence
of other dementia diagnoses. Individuals diagnosed with both CBVD
and senile dementias were classified as having CBVD. Finally,
persons diagnosed with senile dementia alone (ie, without AD or
CBVD) were placed in the senile dementia category. Thus, in
respective calculations of dementia rates, a person was counted only
once. We separated diagnoses of AD and CBVD from the rest of
dementias ("senile") aiming to reduce the heterogeneity in the AD
and CBVD groups rather than to specify senile dementias as a
homogeneous diagnosis.
Statistical Analyses
We evaluated rates of occurrence of first stroke and newly
diagnosed dementia after stroke--by beneficiary age, and
survival after stroke--by duration since the stroke onset. The
date of a disease onset was the first date after the admission
for which an IP claim was found. Rates of dementia after
stroke were calculated for 1 year after the first admission
for stroke. Persons with dementia diagnosis assigned before
stroke event were excluded from the analyses of dementia
risks after the stroke. We also calculated rates of dementia per
year for persons without stroke. Confidence intervals for the
rates and significance of differences between the rates at
different ages were evaluated using standard asymptotic
formulae for the binomial probabilities. To compute age-
standardized rates, we used data on 1999 US 65 and over
population stratified by age in 5-year intervals and by gender
from the US Bureau of the Census data, (http://www.census.
gov), assessed August 1, 2005.
Results
There was slight increase in age-adjusted rates of stroke
appearance from 1984­1990 to 1991­2001 (from 0.0066 to
0.008; P0.08). Changes in the rate by age are shown in

ferent years.

Figure 1. Survival at 1 year after first diagnosed stroke
increased significantly (P0.0001) from 53% to 65% from
1984­1990 to 1991­1996 (Figure 2). The change in 1-year
survival accounted for almost all the improvement in survival
through 5 years after stroke. Mortality among stroke survi-
vors remained very high; however, during 1991 to 1996, by 5
years after admission for stroke, about 65% had died. Note
that the survival functions were limited by 1996 (not 2001)
because we needed 5-year follow-up after the stroke onset to
calculate these functions.
Age-adjusted rates of newly diagnosed dementia in the
entire NLTCS sample rose from 0.0062 to 0.0095 (P0.001)
from 1984­1990 to 1991­2000 (Table). Age-specific (non-
standardized) rates for different types of dementia increased
over time in the entire sample as well (Figure 3). The most
substantial absolute increase in the rates was observed for AD
(Figure 3a). Increases in CBVD and senile dementia were less
pronounced (Figure 3b and 3c).
Overall risk of dementia was much higher (up to 10 times)
during 1 year after stroke as compared with stroke-free
population (Table; Figure 4). This excess in risk was statis-
tically significant (at 0.05 level) for all ages during 1991 to
2000, and for ages between 70 and 90 during 1984 to 1990.
Age-adjusted rates of poststroke dementia increased from
0.043 during 1984 to 1990 to 0.080 during 1991 to 2000
(Table). The greatest (almost 4-fold) relative increase was
observed for CBVD developing after stroke (95% CI [1.83,
7.41]; Table 1). For persons who did not have a stroke, the
overall rate of dementia has also increased (from 0.0061 in
1984 to 1990 to 0.0084 in 1991 to 2000; P0.024), although
the relative increase was less substantial than for stroke
patients (1.38 and 1.87, respectively; Table). Rates of demen-
tia among the elderly without stroke rose largely attributable
to increases in rates of AD (Table). There were comparable
relative increases in the rates of AD among stroke patients
and in stroke-free population during the study period (1.64
and 1.55, respectively). For senile dementia alone, the in-
creases in rates from 1984­1990 to 1991­2000 were small
and statistically not significantly different in individuals with
and without stroke (the relative increase was 1.1 and 1.19,
respectively; Table).
Discussion
Our study demonstrated that stroke rates did not change
significantly over time, whereas the risk of dementia after
stroke substantially increased. The CBVD accounted for
almost all the relative increase in dementia risks among
individuals with stroke (Table). The improved survival from
stroke might contribute to this trend. The improved survival

could favor an increase in the proportion of people with more
severe brain damage who otherwise would have died in the
past. Such persons might be more predisposed to dementia.
The small relative increase in rates of senile dementia over
time (Table) suggests that no major environmental changes
occurred that might have affected rates of dementia for this
group (representing mixed cases of elderly mental deteriora-
tion that are not AD or CBVD). Expanding use of brain
protective medications among the elderly during recent de-
cades suggests that there may even be protective factors
against dementia in population.16,17 Relevant studies are,
however, limited and do not allow to draw reliable conclu-
sions about this potential influence.
The similarity of the relative increases in rates of AD
among persons with and without stroke (Table) suggests that
factors other than survival from stroke contributed to the
change in rates of AD over time. Possible factors include
improved diagnostic procedures for AD, increasing popular-
ity of the diagnosis, and an increase in AD risk in elderly
individuals in an association with some other disorders.
Relative contributions of these factors in increased rates of
AD are, however, not clear.
Comparisons With Other Studies
Comparing our findings with those of previous studies is
complicated by differences in follow-up periods, variations
among countries, and in observational periods. Our analyses
show that the chances of an elderly person being admitted for
a stroke did not change significantly from 1984­1990 to
1991­2001, whereas the probability of surviving a year after
admission for stroke substantially increased from 1984­1990
to 1991­1996. In an earlier (1994) Medicare claims study,12
stroke incidence declined 9.5% from 1985 to 1989, and then
increased 3.3% to 1991. The authors, however, used a
broader list of ICD-9-CM codes that included chronic cere-
brovascular disorders as well. Survival after stroke based on
the US studies13,14 improved between 1982 and 1996 that is in
accordance with our data. Similar to others,1­4 our study
showed substantial (several-fold) excess in risk of dementia
among stroke patients compared with stroke-free population.
The general increase in diagnosed AD has been reported
previously,18 and it is also shown in present study. Because
the higher rates of AD onset were not limited to persons after
stroke in our study, there are clearly general factors account-
ing for the increased rates of the diagnosis.
Strengths and Limitations
Our study has several strengths. Time trends for different
kinds of dementia after stroke were evaluated for the first
time and compared with the trends in dementia onset in a
nonstroke population. This allowed us to evaluate the relative
contribution of the different kinds of mental impairment to
the increased risk of overall dementia and suggest factors
responsible for observed trends. Another important strength is

(all kinds) in entire sample and in persons with stroke (during a

the study's national scope of the data, which is representative
of the US elderly.
We also acknowledge several study limitations. First, we
measured rates of dementia from diagnoses reported in
Medicare claims. There is likely to be variation in the criteria
and clinical evidence used by physicians to make a dementia
diagnosis which affects clinical decision making, eg, treat-
ment of acute myocardial infarction and personal health care
expenditures more generally.19­23 Second, limiting the study
to Medicare Part A inpatient claims plausibly led to an
underestimate of rates of diagnosed dementia. However, the
study objective was to measure time trends in the rates of
diagnosed dementia rather than to estimate "true" incidence.
To determine the trends reliably, we limited our analysis to
the IP records. Third, all study participants were Medicare
beneficiaries, and a selection bias could have arisen because
of the differential access to the Medicare system according to
race, socio-economic status, education, and income. Finally,
there may have also been differential underreporting (eg,
severe stroke patients are more likely to be readmitted and
thus could more likely be identified as having dementia than
those with milder strokes).
Summary
Mortality from stroke declined mainly because of declining
stroke case-fatality. At the same time, rates of diagnosed
dementia increased appreciably from 1984­1990 to 1991­
2000. The relative increase was larger for persons with stroke
compared with stroke-free population (Table). Improved
survival from stroke might contribute to this difference in
trends. The increase in risk of dementia in stroke-free
population was largely attributable to AD (Table).
The increasing trend in dementia recorded in Medicare
claims data may have occurred for several reasons, including
a true increase in underlying risk or an increase in case
identification or diagnosis popularity. More studies are
needed to identify actual reasons for the increasing rates of
diagnosed dementia in the US elderly.
