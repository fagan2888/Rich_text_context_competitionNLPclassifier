Introduction
In recent years, a growing a number of studies focusing on
male clients have shown that they are demographically
diverse with a wide range of motives and behaviors. A num-
ber of studies have shown that some clients' participation in
commercial sex is motivated by their desire for intimacy.
Bernstein (2007) coined the term bounded authenticity to
describe clients' experience of an authentic emotional and
physical connection with a sex worker. Sander's (2008a)
examination of the sexual scripts of "regular" clients of sex
workers displays a mirroring of conventional relationship
scripts in their interactions.Milrod and Weitzer's (2012)
examination of online clients suggest the possibility for a
shift toward unbounded affection and romantic relationships
between clients and their regular sex workers. Milrod and
Monto (2012, p. 793)define the girlfriend experience (GFE)
as " . . . interactions with (sex) providers mirror those found
in conventional non-remunerative sexual relationships."
Bernstein (2010, p. 158)quoted a sex worker who described
GFE sessions involving " . . . lengthy period of foreplay in
which the customer and the escort touch, rub, fondle, mas-
sage and perhaps even kiss passionately." GFE has become a
universally sought-after commodity by male clients, and a
tool used by sex workers to increase their appeal and demand
(Bernstein, 2010; Hoang, 2010; Joseph & Black, 2012;
Milrod & Weitzer, 2012). These intimate acts challenge the
notion that clients indulge in commercial sex for the sole aim
of domination and exploitation. This study examines the dis-
courses and experiences of 23 Malaysian men who have
formed a relationship with a foreign female sex worker
(FSW) to understand their willingness to transcend the
boundaries of commercial sex at the cost of great personal
risk.
Literature Review
Feminist scholars have until recently focused their attention
on the supply side of the sex trade. Feminist scholars are split
in their views on the women involved in the sex trade. On
one side, there are those that support the abolitionist perspec-
tive arguing that men exploit their positions of power by
allowing the sex trade to continue at the expense of the suf-
fering and victimization of the women. They argue that the
unequal power relations between the men in power and the

Risky Pleasures: Malaysian Male Clients
Transcending the Boundaries of
Commercial Sex With Foreign Female
Sex Workers
Lim Soo Jin1 and Cheah Shu Xu1
Abstract
This ethnographic study explores the discourses and practices of male clients of foreign female sex workers (FSWs) who
carried out relationships with their regular FSW. Situated in an environment that rejects and stigmatizes sex work, this
study explores the paths taken by this small group of men pursuing a relationship with a FSW. Findings from a sample of
23 Malaysian men obtained from an online forum and through snowball sampling display a demand for intimacy that for
some clients transcends conventions of commercial sex, while for others display a desire for consumption of commodified
intimacy within the sex trade. Participants' narratives provide an insight as to how FSWs adapt and utilize emotional labor to
their advantage. The resulting relationship is one of extreme inequality in power relations, resulting in both sides developing
different strategies to compensate for their vulnerabilities.

women have allowed the commodification of women to "sex
objects" (Farley, 2003; Dworkin, 1992; MacKinnon, 1989).
On the other end of the spectrum, feminist scholars argue for
the "right" to capitalize on their sexuality for economic
gains. They argue that by restricting their freedom to choose
sex work limits their freedom as women (O'Connell
Davidson, 1995; Overall, 1992; Weitzer, 2010). They argue
for the freedom to choose sex work, citing many legitimate
"women" occupations are built to capitalize on female sexu-
ality with the aims of maximum profit (see Oerton & Phoenix,
2001). To break the deadlock, scholars shifted their focus to
the demand side of the equation which until recently has
been largely ignored.
The early 20th-century view based on the natural male
sexual drive and the psychopathological model proposed by
Charles Winick (1962) who linked men's desire for sex
workers as a sign of mental disorder has largely been aban-
doned by scholars in light of current empirical literature
which suggest that men who purchase commercial sex are
"normal" "everyday" men spread throughout all social
groups with little distinguishing characteristics (Monto &
Milrod, 2013; Monto & McRee, 2005; McKeganey &
Barnard, 1996; Serughetti, 2013). Studies relying solely on
street-level sex workers have been challenged not providing
a complete picture of the experiences of sex workers (Weitzer,
2005), resulting in greater interest on the less visible sectors
(indoor mid-tier and high-end) of the sex trade. Studies have
revealed that clients within the mid and upper tiers of the sex
trade are nether homogeneous group nor specific in their
motives when purchasing commercial sex (Bernstein, 2007,
2010; Frank, 2003; Mansson, 2006; Sanders, 2008a).
Bernstein (2007) noted that the relationship between con-
temporary markets in commercial sex and the growing vari-
ety of sex services in postindustrial societies shows the
difference in the expectations of clients of street-level sex
workers where the exchange is impersonal and focused on
physical release mid and upper tier indoor establishments
who demand greater amounts of intimacy and personaliza-
tion. Sex work within the mid and upper tiers has shown to
require greater amounts of intimacy and emotional labor
from the sex worker.
Bernstein (2007) coined the term bounded authenticity,
meaning a genuine albeit limited sexual and emotional expe-
rience by both the client and the sex worker within the
boundaries of a paid sexual encounter. What is for sale is not
merely the sexual satisfaction of the client but rather an
authentic emotional and physical connection felt by both
parties constrained within the boundaries of commerce and
time. The demand for intimacy in commercial sex is seen in
the widely used term GFE and is understood to signify ver-
bal and physical acts performed by a sex worker akin to that
of a conventional relationship which suggest a mainstream-
ing and partial normalization of intimacy within the sex
trade. These developments are very different from the sex
services described by "career sex workers" who establish
psychological barriers delineating what is for sale and what
it private (O'Connell Davidson's, 1995), where certain inti-
mate acts like kissing is off-limits. This is not to suggest that
there are no limits enacted by sex workers performing GFE,
rather the encounter is not focused on solely the sexual
release of the client but one that includes mutuality and a
genuine emotional experience.
The categorization of GFE in the field reports with the
intention to quantify the emotional labor provided is so
ingrained in online communities that it is seen in almost
every field report alongside clients' evaluations on the sex
worker's physical characteristics, attitude, and sexual perfor-
mance. It should be noted that while many clients understand
the meaning of GFE, what it actually entails varies from indi-
vidual to individual. To some clients, GFE could represent
purely intimate physical acts (kissing, cuddling, oral sex on
the woman), whereas for others, it could mean the suspen-
sion of time during the encounter for conversation and other
nonphysical acts. Regardless of the definition, sex workers
have recognized the demand and have adapted their practice
to take advantage of the demand for commodified intimacy
in return for favorable reviews, which is translated into more
clients and in turn better monetary gains (Earle & Sharp,
2007; Milrod & Weitzer, 2012; Sanders, 2008b). Integrating
intimacy as part of their service has increased the expecta-
tions of the clients failing, which result in negative impres-
sion of the sex worker affecting their demand (Bernstein,
2007; Peng, 2007; Sanders, 2008b). Scholars argue that in no
way is GFE separate from the economic dimensions of com-
mercial sex (Bernstein, 2010; Zelizer, 2005), rather it pro-
vides boundaries in which men are able to take advantage of
their gender privilege to satisfy their demand for an intimate
encounter through monetary exchange. Bernstein (2010) has
reported that sex workers who attempt to breach the bound-
aries of "bounded authenticity" risk driving their clients
away (see Bernstein, 2010). Milrod and Weitzer (2012) also
reported clients experiencing "off the clock" activities with
their regular sex worker such as extended time, sex without
payment and public excursions; however, their study sug-
gests the possibility of transcending the client­sex worker
business relationship into a long-term romantic relationship
or even a conventional relationship. The men in previous
studies have initiated relations with local sex workers, which
bound them geographically thus reducing the amount of ano-
nymity between the two parties. In this study, the imperma-
nent state of the sex worker is a critical difference that is not
examined by previous studies.
Method
This study uses an ethnographic approach using face-to-face
interviews and participation observations. The semistructured
interviews conducted along with onsite participation observa-
tion collected data on the participant's demographics, experi-
ences with commercial sex, specifically their relationship
Lim and Cheah 3
with a FSW. An online forum discussing commercial sex
activities in Malaysia was used as a secondary source of data.
Fifty participants were reached; however, only 23 participants
fulfilled the requirement of the study, which required men
who were in or had been in a relationship with a FSW. The
extent of the relationships ranged from going on multiple
dates in public areas, to sexual sessions that occur outside the
work venue of the FSW and to living with their regular FSW.
All participants reported regular face-to-face and electronic
communication, unpaid sexual encounters outside the sex
establishment, and had engaged in public social activity with
their regular FSW. Although these factors do not necessarily
constitute a conventional relationship, it indicated that these
men attempted to transcend the boundaries of commercial
sex. Racial composition of the 23 participants were 18
Chinese, two Malay, and three Indian; aged between 27 and
46 years of age; 13 single, eight married, and two divorced.
All had a minimum diploma, professionals ranging from
executive to managerial levels, from middle to upper socio-
economic group. Interviews took place between 2010 and
2014, each interviewed over a number of sessions lasting
between 2 and 3 hr. Participants' participation in this study
was voluntary and their identities confidential; names of the
men were changed in this article. They were also informed
that they could terminate or withdraw from the study at any
time. The interviews took place in a number of settings mostly
in public areas where the men felt the most comfortable. The
interviews were transcribed and emailed to the participants to
review and verify its content.
The main problem I encountered was gaining access to this
elusive group. Initially participants were recruited from an
Internet forum where they had posted questions pertaining to
having relations with a FSW. The forum chosen was a forum
by Malaysians specifically on commercial sex activities in
Malaysia. A thread within the forum where men were seeking
advice pertaining to relationships with sex workers or women
of foreign nationalities provided a starting point for this study.
Request by Private Message (PM) for face-to-face interviews
was unsuccessful with only three agreeing to be interviewed,
and none of the three participants provided additional con-
tacts. Forum administrators and senior members held a signifi-
cant amount reputation and respect; their assistance in this
study was invaluable (see Williams & Lyons, 2008) as it
allowed me to participate in a gathering of forum members in
a specified physical location, which provided an opportunity
to gain face-to-face contact with members of this group.
Methodological Concerns and
Limitations
It was common that during the fieldwork, the participants
would decide on an impromptu visit to a brothel which I par-
ticipated in an attempt to integrate and gain the trust of the
group. "Going native" was an issue which I had to tackle with
each participation observation: the dilemma between gaining
the trust of the participants versus the potential risk of compro-
mising the study. Many times, I was misidentified as a client or
urged to buy a sex worker by the pimps and participants.
Prolonged contact with the group forced me to constantly
renegotiate the boundaries of researcher and participant; as
noted by Sanders (2006), the researchers'identities in this area
are rarely clearly defined. This study forced me to constantly
reevaluate my position as a researcher, my gender role, as well
as my opinions on sex workers. Being male allowed me to
integrate myself into the group without the sexual harassment
reported by female researchers (see Marttila, 2008; Peng,
2007; Sanders, 2006). However, I encountered a different set
of problems; my refusal to participate set me apart from the
group, and the men would in jest question my sexual orienta-
tion and constantly test my resolve to truly understand their
situation. One participant said, "if you really want to know,
step into our shoes and experience for yourself." This allowed
me to experience firsthand the peer pressure experienced by
men visiting sex workers in a group as reported by Zheng
(2006). Another problem was participant's initial instinctive
reaction to maintain a masculine image and to "safe face"
especially when they were in a group or during the first meet-
ing, this resulted in initial narratives being superficial. Only in
the subsequent one-to-one interview was I able to gather
detailed descriptions of their relationships with a FSW along
with their feelings toward the relationship.
A limitation in this study is the high ratio of Chinese men;
this was due in part to the sampling method and the polarized
nature of Malaysian society. The senior members and the
forum administrators who lent their assistance to this study
were all Chinese except for one Malay senior member, which
led to a higher proportion of introductions to Chinese partici-
pants. Furthermore, some of the venues visited in this study
were averse to allowing Malay clients, fearing they could be
undercover authorities. While the two respondents might not
be representative of the Malay community, it nonetheless
allowed me to gain a glimpse into Malay mind-set.
The men interviewed in this study were either currently in
a relationship or have had previously been in a relationship
with a FSW; however, only seven out of the 23 men inter-
viewed reported being currently involved with a FSW. The
remaining 16 men were reiterating their past relationship
experiences with FSW; these men displayed regret and
resentment for their failed relationship while illuminating is
nonetheless clouded with the knowledge of hindsight. Five
men also reported having the relationship as long as 5 to 8
years ago; therefore, the accuracy of their recall may come
into question. I was, however, purview to examine the pur-
suit of four participants from the beginning to the end of their
relationship with a FSW.
Intimate Encounters
Majority of participants formed relations when they were
new to commercial sex; their surprise at the intimacy of the
4 SAGE Open
encounter and the FSW's pleasant attitude is a contrast to
their stereotypical perceptions of the impersonal nature of
commercial sex; Loke, a 27-year-old sales executive, recalls
his first experience with a FSW:
First time . . . was quite scary but yet exciting at the same time.
. . . she was really friendly totally not what I expected. I thought
it was all business but she would talk to you and try make you
feel more comfortable.
Sex workers who are able to put their clients at ease are able
to mask the business nature of commercial sex and provide
an intimate experience. This is vastly different from the por-
trayal by the Malaysian media of sex workers as cheap and
impersonal; Mun's perception of a sex worker was changed
after his first experience:
. . . the normal image of a prostitute that you see in the movies
and on TV are those that are waiting by the side of the street . . .
those arrested in dark and dodgy clubs . . . they [sex workers] are
ugly and unclean. But the prostitute was nothing at all like what
I imagined, she was friendly and cheerful and very pretty. It was
great coz she knew it was my first time and she just said to relax
and she sat down and talked to me and just told me about how
first timers were often nervous and we would just take it slow
and easy no pressure.
Participants' experience with commercial sex challenges
their preconceived ideas of sex workers as victims as por-
trayed by the Malaysian media; Mun describes his first expe-
rience as " . . . an intensely satisfying love-making session . . .
with a friendly and eager woman." First time clients tended
to objectify sex workers, and their narratives focused solely
on sexual and the physical traits of the sex worker. However,
their thoughts after their initial encounter are conflicted. On
one hand, they enjoy the pleasures and convenience of paid
sex; on the other hand, the intimate encounter experienced
made it difficult to completely objectify FSWs. Mun's first
experience with a FSW forced him to consider the FSW as an
individual and not just a sex object:
. . . I could not help but think of her as a person I just met and
we were talking about stuff. I used to think that prostitutes were
rude and rough but . . . she speaks well and she's happy, smiling
at me all the time. It was like a real person . . . I mean I know that
she is a real person but what I mean is that she is a real person
that I would have liked to meet and hang out with.
Marshall (1999) noted that in commercial sex, the client is
engaged in physical and emotional contact with a human
being, which entails some form of mutuality making it
impossible to ignore their humanity.
Beginning a Relationship
The result of the intimate encounter is the desire to repeat the
experience, resulting in increased intimacy which garners
better sexual and nonsexual services (Milrod & Weitzer,
2012). These "extra" services include extra shots, postcoital
stimulation and affection, body to body massages, sex toys,
anal sex, and in the most extreme cases, unprotected sex.
Kong, a 34-year-old executive, was introduced to commer-
cial sex by peers and his relationship began initially because
of the service provided:
Her service was good that's why I continued to visit her. After
my 3rd visit she offered me a second shot which I gladly
accepted. Initially it was about the extras which I got for free but
after a while we would just land up talking and cuddling, kissing
. . . it was like having a real girlfriend. I learnt that she came here
to make some money and start a business when she returned to
China, . . . of course I still took the extras, she trusted me enough
to bring out her personal sex toys to play . . . that is the benefits
of going back to one girl.
All participants had relationships with FSWs working in the
mid-tier sector. The mid-tier sex sector in Malaysia consists
mainly of indoor establishments operating behind the façade
of legitimate businesses such as hotels, karaokes, and mas-
sage parlors in an attempt to avoid attention from the authori-
ties (Lim, 1998). Each establishment had different operating
procedures aimed at deterring authorities, many hotels used
health spas as a cover for commercial sex activities, while
other hotels had designated floors where FSWs lived and ser-
viced their clients. FSWs would be given their own rooms in
the hotel; participants reported that the rooms contained
FSW's personal artifacts, which according to the participants
made the experience more "real." The four participants
whom I had followed from beginning to the end of their rela-
tionship began their relationship with their regular FSW in
such a setting. This setting also provided FSWs some flexi-
bility to extend their sessions during low peak hours, which
allowed for the possibility of more intimate encounters.
Milrod and Weitzer's (2012) reported that men start out with-
out expecting anything from their encounters with their sex
worker but gradually develop intimate connections akin to a
conventional relationship. Many participants reported being
motivated by the "excellent" service; however, with each
subsequent encounter, they began to develop unexpected
emotional ties to their regular FSW. Chris, a 30-year-old
Malay executive, developed a relationship with his regular
because of the combination of highly sexual and nonsexual
intimate acts:
. . . her service was amazing. She really loved having sex. . . .
very different from my ex. And it was not like she was slutty, she
was actually quite shy. You could see this after sex where she
would just cover up and cuddle. People say that prostitutes are
whores who just love sex but she was different . . . she spoke
softly and was gentle. . . . before I knew it I was visiting her over
and over . . . she suggested meeting outside, which I agreed.
Client's desire for more intense displays of intimacy makes
them susceptible to believing the affections displayed by
Lim and Cheah 5
FSW is genuine, and the sessions become what Milrod and
Weitzer (2012) called "quasidating" where the client and
their regular sex worker act out relationship scripts of an
actual date, such as learning about each other's background
through prolonged verbal and physical intimacy. Wan, a
33-year-old Malay executive, reported increased interest in
his regular's personality and background after a number of
visits:
At first it was good service with cuddling then it became "When
am I going to see you again?" . . . at the peak I was visiting her
twice, three times a week . . . sometimes for double sessions. . . .
you can't be having sex all the time. Of course I try to have as
much as possible but we would talk during the breaks . . . the
breaks became longer and longer. . . . she was a really nice
person, very witty and interesting, what surprised me was
despite all the hardship she experienced she still managed to
keep a positive outlook on life.
The men who have become regular clients had obtained their
FSW's phone number, Wechat, or Whatsapp number; mak-
ing communication with their regulars is no longer solely
dependent on physical visits, allowing for greater freedom
and more personal connections to be formed beyond the
physical constrains of the FSWs work establishment.
Dissatisfaction and Placing Blame
Scholars have suggested that clients are attracted by intimacy
provided by sex workers because of lack of affection in their
personal lives, whether it is because of their inability or
unwillingness to form conventional relationships (Mansson,
2006; O'Connell Davidson, 1995). Majority of the partici-
pants' narratives center on the willingness of their regular
FSW to provide boundless sexual and nonsexual affections
that they compare with their current partners, revealing their
dissatisfaction with their partner as well as their conserva-
tive, misogynist mind-set:
Foo: My wife could learn a thing or two from these women . . .
like how to treat a man so that he feels like he matters. . . .
women always talk about men doing their share. It is ironic that
they do not do their share.
Rosh: My girlfriend makes me work for her affections, it is
totally different with Fann [FSW], she is always willing, . . . I
think that is the problem with Malaysian women they are
becoming like Singaporeans.
Participants' narratives on the materialistic and demanding
nature of Malaysian women stem from their reluctance to
adapt to changing gender roles brought on by the rapid social
and economic development. Malaysian Chinese women
have benefitted most significantly from these changes result-
ing in higher education and better jobs, coupled with their
adoption of feminist ideals and a focus on career coupled
with their adherence to ingrained traditional dictates of
"suitable partners" has led to a trend in delayed and nonmar-
riage (Jones, 2007; Tey, 2007). Chinese participants' reluc-
tance to adapt to these developments has made it difficult for
some of them to obtain "suitable" partners, increasing their
scorn for Malaysian Chinese women. Their problem in finding
a suitable partner is made more difficult by racial fencing leg-
islation in Malaysia that prohibits Muslim­non-Muslim mar-
riages (Mohamad, 2010), thus limiting potential partners to
non-Malay women. The desire for more feminine and submis-
sive partner has some participants falling for FSWs believing
they are "untainted" by modern society (Mansson, 2006).
Malaysian policies that focus on Muslims, seen in the
case of Wan who's attraction for local Chinese women, has
resulted with constant failure, due in part to the prohibition
of Muslim­non-Muslim marriages. Unlike the Malaysian
Chinese community that has largely been ignored, the
Malaysian government has placed great interest over the
Malay community's sexuality, primarily as a political tool to
consolidate and maintain their power (see Mohamad, 2010).
This has most significantly affected the Malay women where
conflict arising from their education and exposure to modern
ideals clash with the religious doctrines preached by the
Malaysian authorities. A study by Ong (1990) shows the
immense social pressure experienced by Malay women to
conform to their expected roles has resulted in many Malay
women succumbing to the pressure. The Malaysian govern-
ment emphasizes on Islamic teachings and values that
emphasizes the Malay women's central role in the family
(Ong, 1990). Hence, there is a greater desire for marriage and
a fear of being priced out of marriage because of their higher
education and career among the Malay women, which is
noticeable because Malay women are more willing to marry
downwards compared with their Chinese counterparts (Tey,
2007). This has resulted in Malay women conforming to
expected gender roles, which has led to less friction between
genders in the Malay community, as seen in the Malay par-
ticipants of this study who did not display the level of resent-
ment toward Malay women compared with the Chinese
participants.
Risky Relationships
Most of the participants and forum members recognize the
slim chance of success in forming long-term relations with
FSWs. Warnings by forum members revolve around the
interest of FSWs in monetary gains, believing that the inti-
macy is manufactured performances to eliciting favorable
response from their clients:
. . . man is trading money for sex & warmth & the [FSW] is
trading sex for money, simple as that. There is no such thing as
love with a [FSW]. The moment the money ends, the so-called
love also ends!
Studies have shown that sex workers do manufacture separate
identities as part of their strategy to illicit positive reviews
6 SAGE Open
and to cope and control their work environment (see; Brewis
& Linstead, 2000; O'Connell Davidson, 1995; Sanders,
2005). Participants report that FSWs use tragedy and misfor-
tune to gain sympathy from their clients. Studies have shown
that while some FSWs do enter the sex trade because of pov-
erty and lack of choice, not all come from improvised or
uneducated backgrounds, some sex workers come from mid-
dle-class families with no financial problems (see Hoang,
2010; Liu, 2012). Their choice to participate in sex work is
not solely because of poverty or the lack of jobs but rather a
lucrative economic choice (Davin, 2005; Liu, 2012; Mu, Li,
Han, & Zhao, 1996). Forum members claim that these women
choose to work in Malaysia because of lesser competition and
the ability to resume a "normal" life back in their home coun-
try (see; Davin, 2005; Scambler, 2007).
Despite the warnings, some men willingly enter into a
relationship with a FSW; findings from this study indicate
that men who are new (involvement in commercial sex is
less than 6 months) to the sex trade are the most susceptible
to forming emotional attachments to their regulars. Analysis
of postings on the online forum reveal that not all forum
members are totally against the idea of forming relation-
ships; common themes of being human and second chances
feature regularly:
[FSW] is also a woman and I am sure she has her own reason of
joining the flesh trade. She deserve a second chance . . .
. . . a lot of us have bad impression about [FSW] . . . However,
they are still human, they have feelings as well. When the feeling
developed, they are no other than ordinary woman who wants to
be loved and cared for.
Participants were aware of their risky endeavor and used
conventional courtship rituals as a tool to gauge the sincerity
of their regular FSW; gifts and "dates" instead of cash is used
to profess their romantic intentions as well as to gauge their
FSW's interest in material gains. Participants rationalize that
FSWs who are overly interested in monetary gains are insin-
cere, whereas displays of concern over the men's financial
welfare are proof of genuine commitment, as seen in the case
of Ray who formed a 6-month relationship that continued for
another 3 months after his regular FSW left Malaysia:
. . . she never asked for anything. She always just said that it was
enough that I spend my hard earned money visiting a girls like
her and that she was happy with the time we were together. . . .
when I did give her extra she would not refuse but just take it
and look away. It was those little things she did that convinced
me of her sincerity . . .
Ironically, once participants were convinced of FSW's sin-
cerity, monetary exchange played a larger role in their narra-
tives. Ngah says that his "girlfriend" never directly asked
him for money, rather he volunteered to help out with her
financial problems because he did not want to see her
working so hard; Chris felt his relationship with his regular
improved greatly after he helped her with her family's finan-
cial problems; Mun gave RM10,000 to help his FSW's moth-
er's medical bills; according to him, she did not ask for the
money, rather she said that she had to work doubly hard and
could not take time away to be with him; Ray continued to
send money to his regular after she returned to China with a
promise to return as soon as her family affairs was in order;
according to Ray, she decided to enter the sex trade to help
her family especially her mother who struggled to support
her family because of her "useless" father. Hoang's (2010)
study on mid-tier Vietnamese sex workers suggest that deep
acting by sex workers allowed them to capitalize on their
origins to create an imaginary fantasy world where their cli-
ents live in as heroes or saviors to these poor, unfortunate
women.
Conflicting Emotions
All participants anticipated problems arising from family,
peers, and society; while they initially thought they were pre-
pared for the repercussions, findings from this study showed
that they underestimated the amount of pressure experienced
because of their highly stigmatized relationship; approxi-
mately half of the participants reported intense pressure by
family and peers as a cause for the termination of the rela-
tionship. Leong's relationship with a FSW lasted only 3
months; when he ignored the advice from friends, his friends
informed his family members about his relationship with a
FSW which led to heated argument and threats to disown
him if he continued with the relationship:
My friends thought I was just crazy. They continuously pointed
out the problems with the relationship and how it would never
work . . . I began avoiding them. . . . I knew I had to choose
between my friends and my "girlfriend" and I choose her. . . . the
real problem came when my family got word of my "girlfriend's"
background. . . . friends can ignore. Family cannot. . . . she
understood my situation she's Chinese too. . . . until now I feel
that it was my lack of courage that ended the relationship.
Leong's case is unique because of the involvement of his
family; all other participants kept their relationship with their
FSW away from their families, only revealing their relation-
ship to like-minded peers believing that they would better
understand their situation; this, however, was not the case.
Ngah's peers felt that he was being irrational and illogical to
risk his marriage for a relationship with a FSW and they
began avoiding him to distance themselves from the fallout
of the inevitable failure of the relationship. However, Ngah
continued his relationship with his FSW until she left him to
return to China; for some participants, their voluntary isola-
tion from family and friends leave them little choice but to
pursue the relationship to its bitter end, leaving some like
Chris regretful of their decisions: " . . . savings gone, and
nothing to show for it. . . . Never will I fall for the trap of
Lim and Cheah 7
these women, . . . it is true what people say it is all about how
much money they can get." Not all participants regret their
relationship, instead they report positive personal develop-
ment as a result of their failed relationship; Ngah's fulfill-
ment of his deeply rooted desire for his "ideal" woman
justified his relationship:
You must understand I was living the dream that I never had
when I was younger. It felt fantastic walking with a hot chick in
the shopping mall, going for movies and stuff. You feel like a
total stud. My friends were laughing at me but I'm the one
fucking this hot ass.
Ngah's relationship served to boost and reinforced his mas-
culine self-image. Ray was disappointed by the sudden loss
of contact even though he knew it was unlikely to go the
distance; his narratives attempt to justify his "poor" decision
through his monetary contributions and playing up his role as
her savior in time of need:
. . . friends say I'm stupid. Sometimes I feel they are right but I
also know that I helped her in her time of need. . . . at least I
know I did some good.
Others like Wan who was involved with a FSW for 3 months
viewed his experience in a positive manner even though his
relationship with his regular FSW ended when she returned
to her home country:
Firstly I would not be married now . . . I realized [through my
relationship with my FSW] that all women are in it for the
money. . . . she made me realize that to a woman security is what
matters, in the past I would have never thought that I would
agree to marriage setup by my parents. . . . but if I can love a
FSW I'm sure that I can learn to love my wife.
Wan's deference to the selection of a partner by his par-
ents suggests a greater compliance with familiar pressures
and traditional marriage arrangement although highly
uncommon but still accepted by the Malay community.
Pushing the Boundaries
Although all participants use the personal information they
have obtained from their regular FSW as proof of their inti-
mate relationship not all are genuinely interested in pursuing
a long-term relationship (see Mansson, 2006; McKeganey &
Barnard, 1996; Milrod & Weitzer, 2012). Huang, a 42-year-
old business owner, reported having relations with two
FSWs, and his narratives began with themes revolving
around affection and intimacy; however, when his regular
began demanding more time and commitment, he committed
to the role knowing that it would eventually end. Huang's
strategy takes advantage of the impermanent nature of FSWs:
"It was like a real relationship except the sex was better. . . .
It ended when she returned to China. . . . now I have another
`girlfriend.' One leaves another arrives, that's the beauty of
[FSWs]." For Yann, the excitement of the relationship with
his regular FSW is how far he can push the boundaries of
commercial sex while still operating within the provision of
"bounded authenticity":
. . . when you have gotten their trust it is easy to get better
service. By service I don't just mean more "action" but it is the
personal connection. . . . something you cannot get by just
visiting a spa, let me put it this way have you ever had a girl iron
your clothes in the nude.
When queried about whose idea it was to get her to iron his
clothes, his reply was that she wanted to do it herself seeing
as how they had intercourse with their clothes on and he had
to go for a meeting later on. Yann's relationship with his reg-
ular FSW leaves him feeling virile, attractive, and powerful;
" . . . no one knows she is a [sex worker] for all anyone else
knows she is my girlfriend. . . . considering what we do and
what I know about her she is my `girlfriend.'" Yann uses his
relationship as a playground where women not only conform
to traditional gender roles but also are highly sexual.
Conclusion
The conditions that exist in Malaysia varies greatly from
other studies where legislation that drives sex trade under-
ground and transitory nature of FSWs has resulted in greater
inequality in power between FSWs and clients making a
"genuine" long-term relationship highly unlikely. Although
Sanders (2008b) suggested commercial sex does not neces-
sarily result in corruptive, abusive, exploitation of either
party, in this study, the sex worker­client relationships often
end with the exploitation of one or both parties.
Clients who involve themselves with FSWs suspending
their positions of power take great risk for a chance at "love."
It is unsurprising that participants report they do not feel that
their position offers any form of privilege when dealing with
FSWs. They feel that they are exposed to similar, if not more
vulnerable, situation as their FSWs; their role as client is ille-
gal and is not afforded any form of protection if caught.
Participants' narratives attempt to project an image of being
"victimized" as a means to deflect their relationship failure
with FSWs which would result in ridicule and negative self-
image (Worchel, 1984). These findings are parallel to that
reported by Bernstein (2010) where sex workers attempting
to transgress the preset boundaries are met with negative
repercussions; in this study, it is the clients who are "pun-
ished." Findings in this study are similar to that reported by
Milrod and Weitzer (2012) where participants in a relation-
ship with FSWs struggle to gauge the authenticity of the inti-
macy and commitment of their regular FSW to the
relationship. Some participants adopt a strategy which takes
advantage of the limited time FSWs have in Malaysia push-
ing the boundaries of "bounded authenticity" by having
8 SAGE Open
short-term relationships that mirror conventional relation-
ship, which suggests a commodification intimacy that lies
somewhere in between "bounded authenticity" and the
boundary-breaking relationship suggested by Milrod and
Weitzer. The conditions which FSWs operate in Malaysia is
significantly different and while participants display cues of
a conventional relationship, the relationship is constrained
by the transitory nature of the FSWs which prevents it from
manifesting into a truly genuine long-term conventional
relationship.
