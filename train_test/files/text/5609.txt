Introduction
The emergence of the transgender rights movement has
drawn political science and public opinion scholars to
empirically assess public attitudes about transgender peo-
ple and their rights. This growing literature in observational
studies has provided many insights in regards to the impact
of disgust and authoritarianism (Casey, 2016; Miller et al.,
2017), interpersonal contact (Flores, 2015; Pierceson and
Kirzinger, 2015; Tadlock et al., 2017), and body politics
(Miller et al., 2017), on attitudes, as well as support for
transgender candidates for public office (Haider-Markel
et al., 2017). We have also learned how attitudes about
transgender people and transgender rights differ from atti-
tudes about gay people and gay rights (Lewis et al, 2017).
Experimental studies have found that canvassers can dura-
bly reduce transphobia (Broockman and Kalla, 2016),
exposure to information and images of transgender people
can also reduce transphobia (Flores et al, 2017), and that
value frames and identity have the potential to affect sup-
port for transgender people's access to public restrooms
(Harrison and Michelson, 2017a; 2017b).
We contribute to this growing literature by testing a pro-
posed causal mechanism between exposure to transgender
people and increased support for transgender rights: preju-
dice reduction. Prejudice reduction, as used here, is when
negative attitudes and phobias towards marginalized groups
are lowered (Allport, 1979[1954]). We use a survey experi-
ment to assess how prejudice reduction serves as a vehicle
for individual support for transgender rights.

Abstract
Fears, phobias, and dislikes about minorities should be strong determinants of whether Americans support policies
protecting such minorities. Studies suggest that discussions and information about transgender people can reduce
transphobia. However, these studies also indicate that experimental treatments do not necessarily affect individual
attitudes on policies concerning transgender rights. Scholars contend that durably reducing prejudice should increase
public support for minority rights. In this study, we examine this causal mechanism utilizing an experiment. We find that
reducing transphobia is a reliable mechanism to increase public support for transgender rights. These results are robust
to causal identification assumptions, suggesting that this mechanism provides a clear avenue for stigmatized groups to
increase public support of rights for those groups.

theory of interpersonal contact. Subsequent studies, espe-
cially studies about the rights of sexual minorities and
more recently gender minorities, investigate the way per-
sonally knowing someone who is lesbian, gay, bisexual,
and/or transgender (LGBT) is associated with attitudes on
LGBT rights. The presumed, though often untested, mech-
anism linking contact to greater policy support is prejudice
reduction. However, is this assumption correct? Does prej-
udice reduction serve as a vehicle to greater support for
rights for marginalized groups? Our experiment tests this
causal mechanism by exposing individuals to short infor-
mational vignettes and facial images of people presumed
to be transgender. Our post-test then measures transphobia
and support for transgender rights policies. We find that
prejudice reduction is a mechanism for support for
transgender rights. We further show that our results are
robust to key assumptions related to the causal mecha-
nisms of attitude change.
Mere exposure and prejudice reduction: A
mechanism to increased policy support?
Although our treatments are not the same as the contact
hypothesis, studies have shown that simple exposure to
out-groups can reduce prejudices (Zajonc, 1968; 2001;
Zebrowitz, White, and Wieneke, 2008). Previous studies,
for example, have shown that exposure to the lives of lesbi-
ans and gay men via television increases both positive atti-
tudes toward gay men (Schiappa, Gregg, and Hewes, 2006)
and support for lesbian and gay rights (Garretson, 2015).
The mere exposure hypothesis contends that simply expos-
ing people to new concepts has the tendency to increase
likeability toward those objects. Indeed, an experimental
study shows that mere exposure to facial images and infor-
mation about transgender people can reduce discomfort
with transgender people and transphobia (Flores et al,
2017). However, both Flores et al. (2017) and Broockman
and Kalla (2016) failed to find any direct effect of treat-
ments affecting individual attitudes on transgender rights.
In follow-up surveys and a subsequent survey experiment,
Broockman and Kalla (2016) later defined the term
transgender to both treated and untreated households and
randomized exposure to negative transgender campaign
advertisements to connect their canvassing experiment to
individual support for transgender rights. We add to these
studies by more fully examining this mechanism.
A puzzle in both previous experiments is that respond-
ents' prejudices toward transgender people were reduced,
yet there is little evidence of a direct effect on attitudes on
transgender rights. Possibly, there are multiple mechanisms
underlying the direct effect of mere exposure or canvassing
on transgender rights. Some of these effects may be com-
peting. For example, people with higher disgust levels tend
to be opposed to gay rights (Adams, Stewart, and Blanchar,
2014), and LGBT rights may also increase people's disgust
(Casey, 2016). If the experimental treatments simultane-
ously increased disgust levels and reduced transphobia,
then the direct effect may be washed out by these compet-
ing mechanisms. Thus, our study decomposes this direct
effect using a mediation model. The mediation model sepa-
rates the specified causal mechanism--in the current case,
transphobia--from the remaining, unobserved mechanisms
linking treatment to support for transgender rights.
Data and analysis
We fielded a survey experiment that was jointly sponsored by
some of the institutions affiliated with the authors. Clear
Voice Research (CVR) conducted the survey experiment
12-15 June, 2015. CVR maintains a panel of respondents
who serve as a subject pool for research purposes. This pool
was pre-screened with a member profile survey, and CVR uti-
lized numerous validation methods, such as Internet Protocol
(IP) and street address verification to minimize duplicate
respondents and ensure the overall quality of the data. The
sampling methodology is an enhancement over student and
online convenience samples such as Amazon Mechanical
Turk.1 We note that this sample, while an improvement, was
not selected using traditional probability-based methods.
CVR sent 51,492 recruitment emails to empaneled survey
participants. A total of 2102 subjects participated in the sur-
vey, which provided a response rate of 10.82% (AAPOR
RR#2). All subjects consented to participate in the study.
Research design
Treatment:Informationalvignettesandfacialimages.Respond-
ents were randomly assigned to one of four conditions
(three treatment groups and one control group). The three
treatment groups each received an information vignette that
defined gender identity and transgender as follows.
Gender identity refers to how a person identifies their own
gender (as a man, woman, or some other label). For many
people their gender identity may not match their birth sex. For
example, a man may identify more as female, or a woman may
identify more as male. Transgender is a general term for people
whose gender identity or expression is different from their
birth sex. Some transgender people may undergo gender
transition with medical procedures like hormone therapy or
surgery (often commonly called a `sex change'), but others do
not seek such medical assistance. Transgender includes groups
you might have heard before, including transsexual, cross-
dressers, or gender queer people.
The control group received a vignette about Japanese eco-
nomic growth. Subjects in two of the three treatment groups
also received images of gender-congruent or gender-incon-
gruent male and female faces (see Figure 1).2 Respondents
in the Congruent condition received both facial images of
Figure 1(a), and respondents in the Incongruent condition
Flores et al. 3
received both facial images of Figure 1(b). The other treat-
ment group (No Image) received no images but got the gen-
der identity-defining vignette. Flores et al. (2017) previously
showed these exposures have the effect of reducing
transphobia and discomfort toward transgender people, but
did not find any significant direct treatment effects on sup-
port for transgender rights. In this study, we expected the
treatments to cause positive shifts in attitudes consistent
with the mere exposure hypothesis. Our goal in this analysis
was to show how exposure might cause support for transgen-
der rights by way of reducing transphobia. We expected that
transphobia would mediate the relationship between expo-
sure and attitudes about transgender rights.
Mediator variable: Genderism and transphobia. In the survey
post-test, we measured transphobia with questions from
the Genderism and Transphobia Scale (GTS) designed to
gauge people's general tolerance for gender non-conform-
ity (Hill and Willoughby, 2005). The entire GTS contained
32 questions to measure two or three correlated constructs:
genderism, transphobia, and gender-bashing.3 We used a
subset of five items from the GTS to measure transpho-
bia--an emotional dislike against people who violate gen-
der norms. Each of the questions utilized a seven-point
strongly agree to strongly disagree scale. The five items
scaled onto a single construct  =
( )
0 91
. . We rescaled the
items such that positive values indicate higher levels of tol-
erance for gender non-conformity. Full question wordings
are provided in Supporting Information (SI) 2. The media-
tor variable was measured utilizing structural equation
models (i.e., factor analysis) with its mean set to zero and
variance set to one for identification purposes.
Dependent variables: Equality and
accommodations policies
We also included a set of questions about transgender rights
after the measurement of transphobia; these questions were
first asked in a 2011 Public Religion Research Institute sur-
vey on transgender rights (see Flores 2015, Table 1). We
also adapted questions relating to gay rights from sources
like the Gender Social Survey or American National
Election Studies, and we developed questions that were
unique to transgender rights (e.g., public accommodations
and access to public restrooms). These indicators were
measured on a four-point scale, ranging from completely
agree to completely disagree that had no neutral category.
We created scales of these policy questions by first assess-
ing whether transgender rights should be treated as unidi-
mensional or multidimensional (see also Miller et al.,
2017). These policies were more easily grouped into two
dimensions: policies relating to equality and policies
uniquely relating to accommodations (see Flores et al,
2017; Appendix D). Our analysis of transgender rights used
these subsets, and positive values related to greater support
for transgender rights.
Equality policies were defined as policies that ensure the
equal treatment of transgender people. This included
whether transgender people should be protected from job
discrimination, allowed to serve openly in the military, and
included in equal rights generally as would be the case for
lesbians, gay men, and other citizens. Accommodations
policies were defined as policies that would offer additional
protections for transgender people.4 These policies involved
both public and private accommodations, including the use
of public restrooms, medical treatment for transgender
health issues, and businesses' right to use religious reasons
to refuse services to transgender people.
Methods of analysis
Propensity score weighting.We initially conducted a full
assessment of balance checks based on responses to the
pre-test questionnaire and demographics. Our experiment

was a part of a larger survey, and 267 respondents failed to
complete the questionnaire prior to the treatment adminis-
tration. The balance checks indicated some significant dif-
ferences across our treatment groups in responses to the
pre-test, so we created covariate balance propensity scores
(CBPS) to reduce these differences (Fong, Ratkovic, and
Imai, 2014; Imai and Ratkovic, 2014).
Covariate adjustment. We also used covariate adjustment to
increase the efficiency of estimated effects (Gerber and
Green, 2012; Ho et al., 2007). We adjusted for pre-test lev-
els of moral traditionalism by combining four questions
into a single scale  =
( )
0 75
. ; the question wordings came
from the American National Election Studies. We included
partisanship by using a traditional seven-point indicator
ranging from strongly Democratic to strongly Republican.
We additionally controlled for age, race, sex, and whether
someone identifies as LGBT.5
Structural equation modeling.Structural equation modeling
(SEM) allowed us to simultaneously estimate a measurement
model for our dependent variables, examine the structural
parameters of the treatment effects, and decompose effects
for causal mechanisms. SEM used the responses to sets of
indicators to form constructs that correct for potential
measurement error in any single item. The resultant con-
tinuous constructs were then used as dependent variables in
regression models. Since the items forming the constructs
were ordinal, we use a weighted least square with mean
adjusted variance (WLSMV) estimator, which is the best
multivariate estimator with ordinal data (Brown, 2006). We
standardized all of the constructs to have a mean of zero
and variance of one. The linear structural equation model
might carry with it untenable assumptions in identifying
causal mechanisms (Imai et al., 2011). As such, we also
presented results from sensitivity analyses on the key causal
assumption of exogeneity of the mediator and outcome
variables given that both are in the post-test also referred to
as sequential ignorability.
The model schematic is plotted in Figure 2, which shows
the role of the mediator on transgender rights. Our goal was
to examine the role of causally reducing transphobia as an
underlying mechanism of increasing support for transgen-
der rights. Given previous research findings, we expected
the treatments to reduce transphobia, and we anticipated
exposure effects to induce greater support on both transgen-
der rights scales. We conducted two mediation models: the
first with the dependent variable being equality policies and
the second with the dependent variable being accommoda-
tions policies. We estimated the mediation models relying
on the Imai et al. (2011) framework as implemented by
Muthén (2011). Thus, the indirect effects were also the
Average Causal Mediation Effects.

Results
Both models converged and showed adequate model fit
with both the Comparative Fit Index and Tucker-Lewis
Index above 0.95. Consistent with expectations, transpho-
bia had an effect on people's attitudes on transgender rights.
A one standard deviation reduction in transphobia corre-
sponded with a 0.58 standard deviation increase in support
of equality policies (standard error [s.e.] = 0.02, p<0.01)
and a 0.68 standard deviation increase in support of accom-
modations policies (s.e. = 0.02, p<0.01). Also consistent
with expectations, the treatments had reductions in
transphobia relative to the control. The No Image treatment
reduced transphobia by 0.19 standard deviations (s.e. =
0.07, p<0.01); the Congruent treatment reduced transpho-
bia by 0.13 standard deviations (s.e. = 0.13, p<0.05), and
the Incongruent treatment reduced transphobia by 0.18
standard deviations (s.e. = 0.07, p<0.01).6
These results are consistent with our earlier finding that
the effects of the treatment have little direct relationship to
views about transgender rights (Flores et al., 2017). Yet the
mediation analysis presented in Table 1 suggests this null
relationship may be driven by the mediated relationship
between the treatments and transgender rights. The treat-
ments in the present analysis showed statistically insignifi-
cant overall effects on transgender rights, but statistically
significant effects on reducing transphobia. The results
showed that there is a negative, but often statistically insig-
nificant direct effect of exposure to transgender informa-
tion and images on support for transgender rights.
Importantly, we found statistically significant indirect
effects on transgender rights by reducing transphobia.
Exposure tended to increase support on both transgender
rights constructs about one-tenth of a standard deviation,
which is a relatively small effect size. This pattern was con-
sistent in both equality policies and accommodations poli-
cies, and the exposure effect sizes are similar across
treatment groups. The effects of the congruent image were
slightly smaller than that of the other treatments, but they
did not differ in any statistically significant way. As docu-
mented in SI 5, we found that these effects were similar for
Democrats, larger for independents, and were null for
Republicans.
When assessing the effect size relative to the total effect
of treatment on our dependent variables, Alwin and Hauser
(1975) recommended reporting the percent mediated out of
the sum of the absolute value of these effects in models
where the direct and indirect effects are of opposite signs.
We find that the indirect effect ranges from 42.2% to 68.0%
of the total absolute effect of treatment on transgender
rights. This suggests that a substantial portion of the effect
of the treatment is mediated by transphobia.
Since transphobia was measured in the post-test along
with transgender rights, there may be unmeasured confound-
ers in both levels of transphobia and support for transgender
rights. We only observed an individual's responses on
transgender rights and transphobia after receiving treatment,
so the potential outcomes of individual support for transgen-
der rights in a treatment group given that person's level of
transphobia had they been in the control group remained
counterfactual. A key identification assumption for causal
mechanisms was that there is no residual correlation between
the mediator and outcome variables or sequential ignorabil-
ity (Imai et al., 2011). This assumption, however, can be
evaluated by varying how much of a residual correlation
would have to be present to alter or reverse the results. A
robust relationship will not be sensitive to causal identifica-
tion assumptions. We find that our findings are relatively
insensitive to the underlying assumptions to estimating
causal mechanisms (see SI 4).
Discussion
Public attitudes on transgender rights have become a rela-
tively recent area of inquiry and these attitudes are conse-
quential to whether states have transgender-inclusive policies
(e.g., Flores, Herman, and Mallory, 2015). Yet, experimental
studies fail to show their treatments have any direct effect on
transgender rights. Following Broockman and Kalla (2016),
we suggest that this is because experimental treatments affect
attitudes on transgender rights indirectly.
Our findings offer some guidance for those seeking to
influence public attitudes on transgender rights. First,
reducing transphobia is a key mechanism for garnering
support for transgender rights. Second, a way to reduce
transphobia is to humanize transgender people by exposing
individuals to information about them and representations
of them. Finally and consistent with our earlier findings
(Flores et al., 2017), attitudes about transgender people are
likely not dependent on perceived gender conformity.
Exposure to both our perceived congruent and incongruent
images had similar effects on reducing transphobia. We do
note that this does not mean that in highly sensitive circum-
stances, such as when transgender people are in public
restrooms, that the potential for harassment, discrimination
or assault is not dependent on perceived conformity (Miller
and Grollman, 2015). Such contexts may be unique circum-
stances. In addition, because we show both images of gender-
conforming males and females to our respondents rather
than putting them into separate treatments by sex, treatment
effects might actually differ for gender-conforming/non-
conforming transmen and transwomen. Anecdotally, that is
very plausible.
Fully unpacking the causal mechanism from exposure to
policy support has eluded previous research. We provide
some evidence that prejudice reduction is indeed a vehicle
for enhancing support for marginalized groups. Further
research should undertake more robust experimental designs
that would clearly account for sequential ignorability and
6 Research and Politics 
post-treatment bias. Our sensitivity analyses suggest our
results are robust to the former assumption but do little to
address the latter. Alternative research designs as suggested
by Imai et al. (2011) would facilitate in clearly specifying
the ways in which prejudice reduction enhances public sup-
port for the rights of minority groups.

Notes
1. We pre-tested the survey experiment with a sample of 247
people recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. While
many of the results are similar to what we report here, the
MTurk sample tended to exaggerate treatment effects.
2. The facial images selected for our treatment groups came
from a social psychological study (Gerhardstein and
Anderson, 2010). We received permission from the authors
to use these images in the study.
3. The factors are two or three because Hill and Willoughby
(2005) initially found that genderism and transphobia were
separate constructs but a follow-up study found they were a
single construct.
4. We have alternatively conceptualized these measures as
relating to transgender bodies (Miller et al, 2017).
5. The age cohorts are 30-44, 45-64, 65-older with 18-29 as
the reference group. The race categories are black, Hispanic,
Asian, Native American, and multiracial with white as the
reference group.
6. The effect of the Incongruent treatment reduced transphobia
by 0.19 standard deviations in the Accommodations policies
model (s.e. = 0.07, p<0.01). All other treatment effects on
transphobia are the same in both models.
