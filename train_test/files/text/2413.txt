Research examining the factors that precipitate gang membership has contributed substantially to our understanding of gangs and
gang-related activity, yet we know little about the factors influencing intentions to rejoin a gang after having being incarcerated.
This study examines the relationship between gang characteristics, number of incarcerated friends, and family characteristics and
gang reengagement intentions, while controlling for ethnicity. Participants were 206 male serious juvenile offenders interviewed as
part of the Pathways to Desistance Study. The model explained between 35% and 47% of variance in gang reengagement intentions.
However, only three variables made a unique statistically significant contribution to the model (punishment if gang rules are broken,
importance of gang membership, and moral disengagement), with the strongest predictor being importance of gang membership.
The results suggest that challenging young offenders' perceptions about the importance of gang membership might be particularly
effective in reducing gang reengagement intentions after incarceration.
1. Introduction
Research to date has largely focused on identifying the
factors associated with initial gang involvement and the
criminological outcomes of gang membership [1]. Although
past research has established that self-reported intentions to
remain in a gang is a correlate of continued gang involve-
ment, factors associated with the intention to rejoin a gang
after being incarcerated, however, have not been studied
systematically. Intentions are self-instructions to perform
particular behaviours or to obtain certain outcomes [2]
and are, according to the theory of planned behaviour [3],
the theory of reasoned action [4, 5], and the model of inter-
personal behaviour [2], the most immediate and important
determinants of behaviour. Bagozzi [6] further suggested
that intentions or self-predictions were superior predictors
of behaviour than desires, attitudes, subjective norm, and
perceived control over behaviour. Given the robust associ-
ation between gang membership and delinquency [1], the
detrimental effects of prolonged gang membership (e.g.,
increased violent behaviour, precocious transitions, violence
victimization, suicide ideation, and unemployment), and the
potential for these negative effects to accumulate over time
(e.g., [7, 8]), it is imperative that researchers and practitioners
alike learn more about this behavioural intention.
Although hampered by a lack of consensus about how
to define "gangs" and "gang membership" [9, 10], recent
research estimates that in the United States there are an
estimated 25,000 gangs with nearly 750,000 members; 30­
40% of those are adolescents [11]. Previous research exam-
ining what motivates youth to join gangs has identified a
multitude of intersecting variables, including the community
or neighbourhood context (e.g., availability or perceived
availability of drugs, community arrest rate, and availabil-
ity of firearms), family dynamics (e.g., parental proviolent
attitudes, child maltreatment, low attachment, and poor
monitoring), socioeconomic variables (e.g., low education,
poverty, and ethnic minority status), peer influences (e.g.,
association with peers who engage in delinquency or other
problem behaviour), school factors (e.g., low academic
achievement and aspirations, low commitment), and indi-
vidual characteristics (e.g., violence involvement, antisocial

beliefs, substance use, and conduct disorder) (see [12, 13]).
Researchers, however, have advised that the factors associated
with initial gang joining may not prove useful in predicting
sustained gang involvement and continued gang involvement
after reentry to the community following incarnation [14].
Consequently, research examining the factors associated with
the intention to rejoin a gang after incarceration is an
important direction for research so that policy can be directed
at youth most likely to remain in a gang for extended periods
of time, in an effort to prevent the detrimental physical,
behavioural, and psychological outcomes that prolonged
gang involvement has on both individuals (e.g., involvement
in delinquent activity, high risk sexual activity) and society
(i.e., serious and violent offences, homicides, sale and distri-
bution of drugs, and perceptions of disorder and fear).
A small number of studies have linked having run away
from home to youth gang involvement. For instance, in a
sample of gang involved youth, three quarters of girls and
one-third of boys reported having run away from home at
least once [15, 16], while other research has found that many
gang-affiliated youth have run away from home and joined
gangs to obtain protection from dysfunctional and/or abusive
family environments [17]. Research to date has not examined
the relationship between having run away from home and
duration of gang involvement/desistance. However, assuming
that youth join gangs to escape from dysfunctional family life,
it seems likely that such youth are more likely to intend to
rejoin a gang after incarceration.
Ethnic minority youth are disproportionately represented
in gangs, particularly Hispanic/Latino and African American
youth [13, 18]. Indeed, recent figures provided by law enforce-
ment agencies indicate that approximately 46% of gang
members are Hispanic/Latino, 35% African-American/black,
11% white, and 7% other race/ethnicity (The National Youth
Gang Survey, 2011; [11]). Moreover, Pyrooz et al. [19] found
that ethnic minorities' gang involvement persists longer. A
higher rate of gang affiliation among minority youth has been
suggested to be in part a by-product of population migration
[20, 21]. Vigil [22], for instance, suggested that immigrant
youth may experience difficulties in dealing with life in a new
culture, as well as language, cultural, and economic barriers,
and as a result, they may perceive that they have "few options
or resources to better their lives" and "seek a place where they
are not marginalized" (p. 7).
1.1. Characteristics of Family. Although the family character-
istics (structural variables and social process variables) of
gang involved youth have not been well documented [23],
solace from a violent family life, including frequent conflict
and abuse among parents, has been found to be a major moti-
vation for gang joining [24]. Furthermore, Patterson et al. [25]
suggested that when family members use violence to control
the behaviour of others within the family unit, children learn
to control others in a similar manner and carry this forward
into their interactions with others, which leads to rejection
by more conventional peers and the weakening of prosocial
bonds (see also [26]). As a result of this rejection, individuals
might have to cope with adverse circumstances on their
own, thus making them more vulnerable to both short- and
long-term pressures from antisocial influences (e.g., delin-
quent peers, which may include youth gang members)
and the internalisation of antisocial values (e.g., delinquent
beliefs).
1.2. Peer Influences. Research indicates that peer delinquency
(which may result in incarceration) is one of the strongest
predictors of individual delinquency [27], and that gang
involvement is related to affiliation with delinquent peers
(e.g., [28]). However, gang membership has also been
observed to be a significant predictor of individual delin-
quency while controlling for associations with delinquent
peers [29], suggesting that gangs might be distinct from other
deviant peer groups, and indicating the need to examine the
impact of delinquent peer associations (as indexed by number
of incarcerated friends, in this case), on the intention to rejoin
a gang after incarceration.
1.3. Gang Membership Characteristics. Extensive research
suggests that even in the presence of money sharing, gang
membership is unlikely to offer any substantial monetary
rewards. Papachristos [30], for instance, found that gang
members typically make around $50 per day by selling drugs.
Given the hazards associated with drug dealing (i.e., the
possibility of being arrested, robbed, or assaulted), Venkatesh
[31] suggested that lucrative financial rewards are often not
realised by gang-involved youth, and, consequently, pro-
longed gang affiliation is unlikely if money was a driving
force behind the decision to join a gang. Thus, given the low
probability of gang members making substantial amounts of
money, it is unlikely that money sharing will significantly
influence the intention to rejoin a gang after incarceration,
regardless of the gang's capacity to fulfil the social needs of
youths.
It is well documented that gang members face the risk
of violence from within their own gang for breaking rules.
Decker and Van Winkle [32], for instance, reported that
rule violators were expected to walk through a line of other
gang members who took turns beating the transgressor for
rule transgression. Although the impact of rule-breaking
punishment has on the intention to rejoin a gang following
incarceration in unclear, research by Putnam [33] suggested
that gang members who violate rules may be less able to
return to familiar communities to take advantage of family
ties and the social capital accumulated. Thus, this potential
consequence may increases the relative cost of leaving a gang
and result in the intention to rejoin a gang following release
into the community subsequent to incarceration in prison.
An important characteristic of organized groups, such
as gangs, is meetings. Meetings serve variety of func-
tions, including enhancing group cohesion, communicating
responsibilities, and disseminating information. More fre-
quent gang contact has been suggested to lead to a decline
in prosocial networks, resulting in reduced information
flow, opportunities to fill structural holes, and the ability to
accumulate prosocial capital (e.g., [19, 34]). Consequently,
increased frequency of gang contact might reasonably be
expected to be associated with an increased intention to
rejoin a gang after incarceration.
Journal of Criminology 3
The intention to rejoin a gang following incarceration
may also vary according to level of social embeddedness/
position within a gang. Horowitz [35], for instance, found
that it was more difficult for core members (or those in a
leadership position) to leave a gang than peripheral members,
a finding consistent with Klein's [36] research in Los Ange-
les which found that core members were more criminally
active and better integrated into, and perhaps dependent
on, the group than peripheral members. In line with this,
Pyrooz and colleagues [19] reported a robust relationship
between "embeddedness" and continuity of gang member-
ship. Specifically, individuals weakly embedded in gangs were
found to desist at a faster rate than those more deeply
embedded in gangs. Embeddedness was defined as an indi-
vidual's "immersion within an enduring deviant network,
restricting involvement in prosocial networks" (p. 241) and
included items assessing frequency of gang contact, position
in the gang, importance of gang membership, proportion of
friends in the gang, and frequency of gang-involved assaults.
Importantly, however, Pyrooz and colleagues looked at the
factors associated with desistance for both males and females
simultaneously.
Alternatively, rather than core members intending to
rejoin a gang because of attenuated connections to more
prosocial networks, core members may be more likely to
feel the need to reassert their status within a gang following
release from prison than more peripheral members [37].
Whatever the case may be, however, the pull back into a
gang can be seen as amplified for more central members. By
contrast, members at the fringe of a gang may find it easier
to drift in and out of the gang because of less allegiance
or weaker bonds to the group or other gang members [38].
Given this research, it is expected that youth who report that
they have more central roles in their gangs (i.e., a leadership
position) will be more likely to report intentions to rejoin a
gang than those reporting regular membership.
Since membership is structured and gangs typically have
both core and peripheral members, level of commitment
and importance of gang membership may plausibly affect
reengagement intentions. In general, the more favourable an
individual's attitude towards a given behaviour, the stronger
their intention to perform it [39]. Thus, individuals who view
gang membership as more important should be more likely
to report greater intentions to rejoin following incarceration.
Research by Moffitt [40] has also found that the importance
of gang affiliation to individuals can lead to the "knifing-off"
of previously held prosocial attachments (i.e., conventional
peers, school, and parents), which are robust correlates of
delinquency.
The attenuation of prosocial bonds is also important
because of the effect such ties have on conventional beliefs
[26]. In light of this, we suggest that importance of gang
membership will be inversely related to the likelihood of
desistance from gangs (i.e., those individuals who view
gang membership as particularly important should be the
individuals least likely to report not intending to rejoin a gang
following incarceration).
Over time, group processes and related functions
lead gang members to shed their nongang friends and
acquaintances [32]. Indeed, Thornberry et al. [14] referred
to gangs as "social networks that embed their members in
deviant routines and isolate them from prosocial arenas"
(p.7). Consequently, as a result of a decline in alternative
sources of support and resources, times spent with a gang
might reasonably be expected to be associated with an
increased intention to rejoin a gang following a period of
incarceration and release back into the community.
Research on the friends of gang members has found that
gangs do not typically encourage active members to have
friends, particularly close ones, outside of the gang (e.g.,
[41]). As positive peer relationships (nongang friends, in
this case) may be an important component of the identity
transformation that may prevent juvenile offenders from
wanting to return to the lifestyle, which may have included
gang membership, which resulted in their incarceration [42],
we expect that having fewer nongang member friends will
be associated with intentions to rejoin a gang after incarcer-
ation. Conversely, and in line with Wood and Alleyne [10],
desistance, or the intention to not rejoin a gang, might occur
when prosocial opportunities and institutions are restored
(i.e., stable nongang relationships) or remained intact during
gang membership.
1.4. Moral Disengagement. When individuals encounter sit-
uations requiring immoral behaviour to obtain benefits, they
experience moral conflicts [43]. This may lead them to engage
in what Bandura [44] described as moral disengagement
strategies, which consist of "cognitive restricting of inhu-
mane conduct into a benign or worthy behaviour" [44, p.
101]. Social cognitive theory [44], much like neutralization
theory [45], describes eight strategies that individuals may
employ to rationalise and justify their harmful acts against
others. "Moral justification," "euphemistic labelling," and
"advantageous comparison" refer to mechanisms that serve to
cognitively restructure harmful acts so that they appear less
damaging. "Dehumanization," "distortion of consequences,"
and the "attribution of blame" mechanisms serve to reduce or
eliminate the distress one perceives to be causing a victim.
There is some data to suggest that gang members employ
these techniques to cope with the negative consequence of
their actions [46, 47]. Alleyne and Wood [9], for instance,
found that moral disengagement strategies were more preva-
lent among gang-involved adolescents than their non-gang-
affiliated peers. Furthermore, results of Alleyne and Wood's
study indicated that although moral disengagement as a
whole did not have a significant main effect, at an individual
strategy level, gang members used more euphemisms and
blamed their victims more than nongang youth.
1.5. Psychopathy. Research has shown that certain psycho-
pathic traits (e.g., low empathy and poor impulse control)
may be important in determining who will join a gang
(e.g., [48, 49]). Indeed, youth with psychopathic traits have
been found to be five times more likely to join a gang than
youth without such traits [50]. Youth with greater levels of
psychopathy have been noted to be less sensitive to informal
social controls (e.g., parental supervision), which have been
observed to contribute (albeit modestly) to gang membership
4 Journal of Criminology
[51]. Furthermore, Valdez et al. [49] reported that gang
members have greater Psychopathy Checklist-Screening Ver-
sion (PCL-SV; [52]) total scores, as well as higher scores
on the Interpersonal-Affective and Antisocial-lifestyle sub-
scales of the measure. Similarly, another study comparing
the criminal attitudes and psychopathic traits of gang- and
non-gang-affiliated offenders ( = 168) recruited from
youth correctional institutions in Singapore found that gang-
affiliated youth scored significantly higher on the Impulsive-
irresponsible subscale of the Youth Psychopathic Trait Inven-
tory (YPI; [53]) than their non-gang-affiliated counterparts
in univariate analysis. However, when criminal attitudes (as
indexed by the Measure of Criminal Attitudes and Associates;
[54]) and attitudes toward gangs were controlled for, this rela-
tionship became nonsignificant [48]. Thus, although research
has shown that certain psychopathic traits may be important
in determining who will join a gang, it is unclear whether
such traits may influence gang reengagement intentions.
1.6. The Present Research. Given the risks associated with
lengthier gang membership, the current study adds to
the literature by focusing on isolating the specific factors
associated with juveniles' intentions to rejoin a gang--an
important predictor of continued gang involvement [19],
to inform intervention efforts in detention facilities. The
present study uses cross-sectional data from the Research on
Pathways to Desistance (RPD) project--a large-scale study of
serious adolescent offenders--to investigate the relationship
between gang characteristics (money sharing, punishment
for rule breaking, frequency of contact, position in the
gang, importance of gang membership, number of nongang
friends, and time with gang), number of incarcerated friends,
and family characteristics, having run away from home and
parental physical fights, controlling for ethnicity, and gang
reengagement intentions. The focus of the current research is
not on the effects of incarceration, because participants were
interviewed within 75 days after their adjudication (for those
in the juvenile system) or 90 days after their decertification
hearing, but instead on previously mentioned predictors of
gang reengagement after incarceration.
2. Method
2.1. Sample. As described in more detail elsewhere (e.g., [55]),
participants were serious adolescent offenders from Philadel-
phia, Pennsylvania, and Phoenix who were interviewed as
part of the Pathways to Desistance Study. Participants were
included in the study if they (a) had been adjudicated guilty
of a serious felony (excluding less serious property crimes),
misdemeanour weapons, or misdemeanour sexual assault
offense in juvenile or adult courts in Philadelphia or Phoenix
and (b) were between the ages of 14 and 17 at the time
of their offence. A total of 3,807 youths met the inclusion
criteria, 1,799 of whom were excluded because of operational
or design constraints. Of the youths that were located and
contactable, 80% agreed to take part in the study (N =
1,355). Participants were administered a baseline interview
over 2 days in two, 2 h sessions within 75 days after their
adjudication (for those in the juvenile system) or 90 days
after their decertification hearing in Philadelphia or an adult
arraignment in Phoenix (if in the adult system). Interviewers
and participants sat side by side facing a computer, and
questions were read aloud to avoid any potential difficulties
arising from reading difficulties. Participants could answer
the questions aloud or, to maximize their privacy, enter their
responses on a keypad (although in some facilities, this option
was not available). Of 1,335 participants included in the study,
we selected only those reporting having been part of a gang
before incarceration. Furthermore, due to very small number,
we excluded females ( = 28) from the analysis, which
resulted in a sample of 206 male gang members.
2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Gang Membership Characteristics. A series of questions
adapted from studies by Thornberry et al. [56] and Elliot
[57] were used to assess characteristics of gang membership.
Consistent with a long line of gang research, self-nomination
was used to operationalize gang membership (i.e., partic-
ipants were asked if they were "ever in a gang"). If gang
involvement was endorsed, additional items were asked to
explore individual's subjective experience of the gang and
gang cohesiveness. For this study, we focused on the following
items: "does your gang/posse share money?" (yes/no); "does
your gang/posse have punishments for breaking the rules?"
(yes/no); "in the past six months, before you came into the
system on this charge, how often did you have contact with
the gang/posse?" (less than monthly, once per month, less
than weekly but more than monthly, once per week, twice per
week, 3­6 times per week, and daily); "what is/was your posi-
tion in the gang/posse?" (leader/member); "how important is
the gang/posse to you?" (1 = not at all to 5 = extremely); "how
many of your friends are not members of the gang/posse?"
(none, a few are not members, half are not members, most
are not members, and all). The item "do you expect to be a
member when back on the street?" (yes/no) was used to assess
the intention to rejoin a gang following incarceration.
2.2.2. Number of Incarcerated Friends. Participants were
asked to report the number of friends that they had who have
been in prison (count variable).
2.2.3. Run Away from Home. Participants were asked to
respond to a single item which asked, "Have you ever run
away from where you were living?" (yes/no).
2.2.4. Characteristics of Family. Family characteristics were
assessed using two binary coded (yes/no) items which asked
"has anyone in your family been in jail or prison?" and "did
your parents have physical fights?"
2.2.5. Psychopathy. The Psychopathy Checklist-Youth Ver-
sion (PCL-YV; [58]) was used to assess youths' psychopathic
traits. This 20-item rating scale is based on two sources: (1)
an interview with the youth and (2) charts and collateral
information. The original semistructured interview guide
was adapted for use in this study and reviewed with the

interview's developer. Following the interview and a review
of records/collateral information, the interviewer used
a 3-point ordinal scale to indicate how well each of the
20 items applied to the youth (0 = does not apply, 1 =
applies to a certain extent, and 2 = applies). A two-factor
solution (Factor 1: Interpersonal-Affective and Factor 2:
Antisocial-lifestyle) to the PCL-SV was adopted in the
present research, although 3- and 4-factor solutions have
been found to provide better model fit (see [59]) due to these
researchers being unable to access all PCL-SV item scores (see
http://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/codebook/pcl-sb.html).
Internal consistency of Factor 1 ( = .76) and Factor 2 ( =
.78) was good.
2.2.6. Moral Disengagement. The Mechanisms of Moral Dis-
engagement [60] was used for this study to measure ado-
lescent's attitudes concerning the treatment of others. The
self-report measure contains 32 items to which participants
respond on a 3-point Likert scale (1 = Disagree to 3 = Agree),
with higher scores indicating a greater moral detachment.
Mean item total scores were used as an overall scale measure
of moral disengagement ( = .88).
2.2.7. Demographics. We control race/ethnicity (dummy
coded as Hispanic or Non-Hispanic) and gender. To control
for gender, we excluded females from the analysis, since they
exhibited much lower levels of gang activity.

Hispanic (62.1%), and of the 152 regular members and 54
leaders/top men in a gang, more than half (53.4%) reported
the intention to rejoin a gang following incarceration.
3.2. Binary Logistic Regression. Direct binary logistic regres-
sion was used to assess the impact of ethnicity, having run
away from home, parental fighting, number of incarcerated
friends, gang characteristics (money sharing, punishment for
rule violation, frequency of contact, position, importance
of gang membership, time spent with gang members, and
number of nongang friends), moral disengagement, and
the two psychopathy factors on the likelihood of reporting
intentions to rejoin a gang following incarceration. Prelimi-
nary analyses were conducted to ensure no violation of the
assumption of multicollinearity (see Table 3). Little's MCAR
test (1998) indicated that data was not missing completely at
random (2 = 214.99, df = 78;  < .001). Consequently,
missing values were problematic and regression analysis was
conducted without imputation being made (missing cases
were removed from final analysis).
A test of the full model containing all predictor variables
against a constant-only model was statistically significant
(2 = 82.27,  < .001), indicating that the model was able

to distinguish between individuals reported intentions to
rejoin a gang after being incarcerated and those not reporting
such intentions. The Cox and Snell R2 value was .35 and
Nagelkerke R2 was .47. The model displayed satisfactory
positive predictive value correctly classifying 80.1% of cases.
As shown in Table 4, only three of the variables made
a unique statistically significant contribution to the model
(punishment if gang rules are broken, importance of gang
membership, and moral disengagement). The strongest pre-
dictor to belonging to the gang reengagement intention group
was importance of gang membership (OR = 2.55,  <
.001). This result indicates that for every unit increase in
importance of gang membership, an individual was 2.55 times
more likely to express the intention to rejoin a gang group,
while controlling for all other factors in the model. Moral
disengagement was also positively related to reengagement
intentions (OR = 1.11,  < .05), while number of nongang
friends was negatively related to reengagement intentions
(OR =.67,  < .05), while controlling for all other factors in
the model. This suggests that for every unit increase in moral
disengagement, an individual was 1.11 times more likely to
endorse the intention to rejoin a gang group, while for every
unit increase in nongang friends, individuals were less likely
to rejoin the gang.
4. Discussion
Although research has established that intentions are the
most immediate and important determinants of behaviour
action (e.g., [4, 5]), and work by Pyrooz et al. [19] established
Journal of Criminology 7
the relevance of behavioural intentions for continued gang
involvement, the correlates of this important indicator have
not been previously examined. The aim of this research,
therefore, was to specify and test a model to explain why
young offenders intend to reengage with gangs to which
they previously belonged. The model explained between 35%
and 47% of variance in gang reengagement intentions and
successfully distinguished rejoiners from those not signalling
an intention to rejoin.
Although the model overall explained a sizeable about of
variance of gang reengagement intentions, only punishment
if gang rules are broken, importance of gang membership, and
moral disengagement made unique statistically significant
contributions to the model. The significant influence of fear
of retribution for gang rule infringements on intentions
to remain a gang member supports the hypothesis that it
may be perceived by gang members to be safer and less
costly to rejoin rather than to leave [33]. It is not clear,
however, if respondents expressing this view had knowingly
broken the rules or were concerned that if they refrain from
rejoining the gang on release, this would feed the suspicion
that information about the gang had been disclosed to the
authorities whilst in custody putting them at even greater risk.
Neither psychopathy factor significantly influenced the
intention to rejoin the gang postincarceration. Consequently,
despite research suggesting that youths with psychopathic
traits are five times more likely to join a gang than those
without [50], results of the present research indicate that
psychopathy is neither a risk factor for reengagement nor an
influence on the intention to sever links. This suggests that
prioritising working with young offenders displaying psy-
chopathic traits would be an ineffective means of attempting
to prevent reengagement with gangs following incarceration.
This is a useful finding, particularly if it is replicated in other
studies, in that it potentially spares criminal justice and social
work practitioners from concentrating their efforts and scarce
resources on psychopathic young offenders who are at no
greater or lesser risk of resuming gang membership, following
release from prison, than any other gang member.
By contrast, the number of friends of young offenders
had, who were not involved with gangs, was, as hypothesised,
a significant factor in the extent to which offenders were likely
to reengage with gangs following incarceration. The lack of
"normal" friends meant a greater likelihood of rejoining a
gang. This suggests that the exposure of young offenders
to lifestyles and behaviours other than those associated
with the close-knit culture and daily experience of gang
membership reduced their need to rejoin gangs following
release from prison. It is interesting to speculate on how this
effect arises. One explanation might be that commitment
to a gang is somewhat weaker among young offenders with
non-gang-involved friends and that this is later reflected
in a diminished desire to rejoin postincarceration. Youth
diversion programmes that steer youth away from gangs and
boost their exposure to a wider range of lifestyles and role
models may have some success, even among gang members,
in severing their links with gangs after release [9]. This
begs a question about the presence of nongang members
and prosocial role models among peer groups within the
communities in which the young offenders live. It may be
more difficult to avoid recruitment by gangs or escape their
influence in highly criminogenic ethnically segregated poorer
neighbourhoods [61]. Within the prison environment, the
implication of this finding suggests that there might be some
merit in ensuring that gang-involved young offenders are not
placed in the same cells.
The positive relationship between moral disengagement
and reintegration suggests that this cognitive mechanism
is a particularly effective "moral shield" for gang-involved
young offenders, whether on the streets, during imprison-
ment, or following release. This relationship is also entirely
consistent with the negative association between the number
of non-gang-involved friends and the decision to rejoin.
The moral disengagement of young offenders from society,
at large, is likely to be preserved within a close-knit gang
community, isolated from prosocial influences and governed
by strict rules, but challenged and potentially weakened,
when exposed to the cultural norms, values, and behaviour
of nongang members.
Even though risk factors for rejoining a gang may be
identifiable, knowing how and when to intervene to neu-
tralise or reverse them is a considerable challenge. The
timeline for intervention is potentially lengthy, involving
action preincarceration, during imprisonment and following
release. Ideally, the most desirable outcome would be to
prevent gang formation and recruitment at the outset but
there may be options to intervene during a period of incar-
ceration to reduce the likelihood of reintegration after release.
Identifying which factors influence young offenders to rejoin
gangs, as this paper has demonstrated, does not automatically
lead to the implementation of appropriate interventions and
countermeasures. The success of interventions in reducing
recidivism generally is mixed and the evidence base of "what
works" is sparse, although there is evidence that incarcerating
gang members, curriculum-based prevention programmes,
and using adult prison visits to scare minor juvenile offenders
do not reduce the chances of reoffending and in some cases
can be harmful [62, 63]. However, the findings from this
paper do provide some clues about the general direction
preventive approaches might take.
The most significant finding is the discovery that psy-
chopathy among young offenders has no influence on their
intention to reengage with gangs, once they have left prison.
This is important because it suggests that psychopathy would
not be an obstacle to steering young offenders away from
reengagement with gangs. Unlike psychopathy, other drivers
of reengagement may be more amenable to attenuation
through targeted projects and interventions.
The intention to reengage with gangs, and indeed their
perceived importance, indicates that they fulfil a need in
young people for belonging and identity. But their attraction
also signals that there is a lack of alternatives to gang
membership and opportunities for young people, which
become particularly marked at the point of release. It is at
this stage, that they need help with resettlement, health, and
housing needs, support with skills and training, access to
employment opportunities, and other forms of assistance
that provide attractive alternatives to gang membership. A
8 Journal of Criminology
recent systematic review of "focused deterrent strategies"
targeting gangs and criminally active groups suggests that
offering gang members job training, employment, substance
abuse treatment, housing assistance, and a variety of other
services and opportunities produces large statistically sig-
nificant reductions in violent crime [64]. Other approaches,
using a varied menu of law enforcement sanctions to curtail
violent behaviour (so-called "pulling levers") and incentives
focusing social services and community resources to targeted
offenders have shown promising results [65].
The findings from this study also indicate a need to
challenge young offenders' perceptions about the importance
of gang membership, particularly its disadvantages and the
costs of membership for familial relationships and quality
of life. The impact of having non-gang- involved friends on
the intention not to rejoin gangs also suggests that there may
be merit in demonstrating to young offenders that there are
alternative, more rewarding lifestyles to gang culture and that
it is possible to exit from gangs without coming to harm.
The findings also suggest that promoting young offenders'
moral reengagement would have a significant effect on the
likelihood that young offenders will not rejoin gangs on
release. The objectives are clear but the means by which they
might be realised is another matter entirely.
Notwithstanding these suggestions, it is necessary to
highlight some caveats surrounding the broader applicability
of this research to policy. Firstly, additional studies are
required to corroborate the findings (the sample was drawn
from a limited young offender population that was primarily
Hispanic). Secondly, it would be advantageous to undertake
an analysis with a larger array of measures to create a
more extensive evidence base on risk and protective factors
influencing gang reintegration. Thirdly, as gang members
were incarcerated for no more than 90 days, further studies
examining gang members' responses to the intention ques-
tion are advisable because participants' responses may change
significantly after "fully" experiencing incarceration. Finally,
as the question on the intention to resume gang membership
was dichotomous, future research might usefully explore
conditions attached to rejoining in order to test the determi-
nation, by the offender, to become a gang member once again.
