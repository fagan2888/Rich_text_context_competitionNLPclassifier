Introduction
An increasing number of studies analyze traditional politi-
cal institutions and representatives, that is, chiefs, elders,
or councils and courts made up of traditional leaders
(Acemoglu et al., 2014; Baldwin, 2013, 2014, 2015;
Baldwin and Mvukiyehe, 2015; Koter, 2013). Traditional
institutions and leaders can have a significant influence in
mobilizing their constituencies, since constituents per-
ceive them as legitimate political actors in otherwise weak
states (Logan, 2013).
In this paper, we explore the causal mechanisms through
which traditional institutions increase cooperation in their
constituencies. We argue that a better understanding of how
traditional institutions affect cooperation will provide key
insights into how mobilization plays out in local communi-
ties. Specifically, we posit that traditional institutions but-
tress cooperation by providing the selective incentives
necessary to solve collective action problems. To test this
argument, we worked with the Buganda Kingdom in
Uganda, one of the oldest and largest pre-colonial institu-
tions remaining in Africa, and employ a lab-in-the-field
experiment using modified public goods games. The exper-
imental design allows us to test two possible causal mecha-
nisms through which traditional institutions might affect
cooperation and mobilization: a horizontal mechanism
driven by peer-to-peer effects; and a vertical mechanism
driven by access to social hierarchies. We find evidence for
the latter, and none for the former. This suggests that tradi-
tional institutions increase cooperation because individu-
als' expect that their cooperation and investment will be
rewarded by social elites, rather than through an increase in
the salience of ethnic identity among co-ethnics. Our find-
ings not only speak to the role of traditional institutions in
these communities, but may also be informative for other
contexts in which culturally-based institutions and recog-
nized representatives of identity-based groups (e.g., reli-
gious leaders) can align individual interests to increase
social cooperation in their constituencies to overcome col-
lective action problems.
Traditional institutions and social
cooperation: Experimental evidence
from the Buganda Kingdom
Mitchell Goist1 and Florian G. Kern2
Abstract
Recent studies show that traditional institutions and their representatives--such as chiefs or elders--are influential
political forces in Sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere. In this paper, we explore the causal mechanism through which
traditional institutions increase cooperation and mobilization. We employ a lab-in-the-field experiment using modified
public goods games involving the Buganda Kingdom of Uganda. We incorporate references to traditional authority
to measure whether participants contribute more when traditional institutions are involved. We explicate and test
two possible mechanisms through which traditional institutions might affect cooperation and mobilization: a horizontal
mechanism driven by peer-to-peer effects; and a vertical mechanism driven by access to social hierarchies. We find
evidence for the latter. This suggests that traditional institutions increase cooperation, because individuals expect that
their cooperation and investment will be rewarded by traditional social elites.

Linking traditional authorities and
social cooperation
When discussing traditional institutions, we do not neces-
sarily refer to ancient, static institutions, but rules and
regimes that constituents of an ethnic group deem legiti-
mate based on narrative, history, or custom. While in Sub-
Saharan Africa, traditional institutions have undergone
significant changes during colonial and postcolonial peri-
ods, several scholars have recently shown the persisting
importance of traditional political institutions (for an over-
view see Holzinger et al., 2016).
Regarding contemporary traditional institutions, using
data from the Afrobarometer, Logan (2013) demonstrates
that constituents across the continent see traditional leaders
as influential local actors. In her work, Baldwin (2013,
2014, 2015) provides an extensive analysis of traditional
leaders as "development brokers," and how they leverage
public goods provision to mobilize constituents. Koter
(2013) shows that where strong traditional leaders exist,
cross-ethnic allegiances can emerge when political candi-
dates, via these intermediaries, reach out to non-co-ethnic
communities. Baldwin and Mvukiyehe (2015) demonstrate
that chiefs selected by customary mechanisms perform bet-
ter in providing public order in Liberia.
Yet, the link between traditional institutions and collec-
tive mobilization in contemporary politics is still insuffi-
ciently understood. For instance, in explaining the positive
effects that Gennaioli and Rainer (2007) find linking central-
ized traditional institutions with local public goods provi-
sion, they are careful to highlight their findings as association,
not causation. Similarly, in their analysis of regional devel-
opment patterns, Michalopoulos and Papaioannou empha-
size that, while robust, their results do not imply causation
(Michalopoulos and Papaioannou, 2015: 62). They call for
further research into the causal channels behind their find-
ings. Our study constitutes an attempt to identify the causal
mechanisms by which contemporary traditional institutions
affect social cooperation by using an experimental design.
Theory and hypotheses
We assume that traditional institutions provide the mecha-
nism through which co-ethnics can better solve collective
action problems. We hold that signalling to constituents
that traditional institutions are involved in collective action
scenarios cues the trust individuals have in their traditional
polity, and assures participants that greater utility through
cooperation--the collectively and individually more desir-
able outcome than mutual defection--is achievable. This,
in turn, increases the potential of constituents to cooperate
for a collective cause.1 In other words, if constituents find
themselves in situations of uncertainty which may lead to
collectively inefficient outcomes, the involvement of tradi-
tional institutions and their representatives may offer
assurance that individual contributions and investments
will be rewarded, thereby fostering cooperation. Thus, our
general hypothesis H
1
is:
H
1
If the involvement of traditional institutions in col-
lective action is signaled to constituents, cooperation
among constituents increases.
We assume that traditional institutions in general foster
social cooperation. We use a stronger and a weaker defini-
tion of constituents: the stronger definition entails individu-
als whose ethnic identification matches that of the
traditional polity (co-ethnics). That is, respondents of the
Baganda ethnic group may place trust in the institution of
the Kabaka and the Kingdom. The weaker definition refers
to individuals who live within the geographic sphere of
influence of the traditional polity (co- and non-co-ethnics).
For example, an individual identifying as Munyankole who
lives in Kampala among a majority of Muganda may also
adhere to calls for immunization by the Buganda Kingdom.
Using the stronger and weaker definitions reflects recent
evidence, showing that ethnic identification can go beyond
one's core group if linked to potential public goods provi-
sion because of the local ethnic geography (Ichino and
Nathan, 2013), and that governance authorities are strategic
in their activities regarding the provision of public goods
depending on the ethnic setup of their constituency
(Ejdemyr et al., Forthcoming).
We identify two causal mechanisms which may foster
ethnic identification and cooperation involving traditional
institutions: (a) a horizontal "peer" effect; and (b) a vertical
effect based on social hierarchies of the polity. We discuss
each related hypothesis in order:
H
2.1
Horizontal signaling of support for the traditional
institution to peers increases cooperation among
constituents.
Constituents can signal their support for the involved
traditional institution to each other. This horizontal signal-
ing may increase contributions to the public good, as it cues
a coherent group identity, and fosters a constituent's trust in
her/his peers' contribution. Constituents may rally even
without their traditional leader instigating mobilization, by
referencing their institution to each other. This horizontal
signaling may trigger an increase in the salience of group
identity, which would buttress cooperation. This increased
salience could provide a greater psychological utility to the
individual, thereby balancing the cost the individual incurs
from engaging in collective action.
H
2.2
Vertical signaling of support for the traditional
institution to traditional representatives increases coop-
eration among constituents.
Goist and Kern 3
That is, constituents can signal their support for the
involved traditional institution to that institution's repre-
sentatives. This vertical signaling may increase contribu-
tions to the public good, with constituents under the hope or
expectation that their contribution is rewarded at some
future point, given their previous experience with public
goods provision of traditional institutions and their legiti-
mate representatives. Signaling can happen via popular
elections, although these frequently do not exist in more
centralized traditional polities. Alternatively, constituents
can voice their support or critique to representatives of the
organization of the traditional polity, for example, village
level chiefs or traditional bureaucracies who communicate
the critique through the ranks, similar to mechanisms in
smaller, more decentralized polities. This theory suggests
that selective incentives, in the form of increased favor with
superior traditional representatives, provides the benefit to
override costs incurred from collective action. Mares and
Young (2016) provide related evidence that traditional
leaders provide these selective incentives, in the form of
both positive and negative inducements, to further clien-
telistic practices. Similarly, Gottlieb (2017) suggests that
traditional leaders can employ threats of retribution to
encourage pro-social behavior in a lab-in-the-field experi-
ment in Senegal.
Experimental design
The Buganda Kingdom as a target polity
The Buganda Kingdom represents a prominent case of a tra-
ditional polity, since it plays a significant role in Ugandan
politics (Englebert, 2002; Lindemann and Goodfellow,
2013). Buganda is the most influential of the constitutionally
recognized traditional institutions in Uganda. With about
17% of the population identifying as Baganda, the ethnic
group constitutes the largest in the country. Over 40% of
Muganda constituents surveyed in the Afrobarometer (2009)
say they trust their traditional leaders "a lot," and a majority
of about the same percentage would like their influence to
"increase a lot." The king (kabaka), his administration, and
parliament (lukiiko) are based in Kampala, Uganda's capital.
Today, the Kingdom lays claims to much of the land in
Uganda's Central Region, and is frequently in open conflict
with the Ugandan government, which is dominated by
President Museveni's co-ethnics, the Muyankole.
The partner in our experiment, the Buganda Cultural and
Development Foundation (BUCADEF), was established by
the Buganda Kingdom as a non-governmental organization
in 1994 "spearheading and directing social economic devel-
opment in communities."2 To fund some of its activities in
areas such as food security or sanitation, the BUCADEF
provides certificates to recognize individual donations and
contributions. For their donation to the Kingdom, benefac-
tors receive a formal certificate stating the amount of the
donation, and displaying a text in Luganda language "bless-
ing" the donor, the seal of the Buganda Kingdom, as well as
the signature of the prime minister of Buganda (the Katikiro).
Both the success of the BUCADEF's efforts and previous
work suggest that these certificates are highly prized and
considered a badge of social honor.3
Sample and experimental game
To tease out the causal mechanisms linking traditional
institutions and social cooperation, we employ an experi-
mental design. While observational methods might allow
us to test hypothesis H
1
, without experimental manipula-
tion, it would be impossible to disentangle horizontal and
vertical effects, as both are a large part of the Kingdom's
official recruitment strategies. Therefore, a lab-in-the-field
approach provides an opportunity to disentangle the iso-
lated effects of each theoretical mechanism in a controlled
environment. Due to space constraints, the online
Appendices B, C, and D present the sample selection strat-
egy and sample details, the enumerator instructions, and the
accompanying survey questionnaire employed several days
prior to the intervention. Overall, we aimed at a sample of
225 participants with 75 individuals for each of three treat-
ment conditions (see below), to which participants were
assigned randomly upon arrival at the experimental site.
Our primary outcome of interest is cooperative social
behavior. Following the behavioral economics literature,
we operationalize this outcome with a public goods game.
In the classic public goods game set-up, each individual is
provided with an endowment, from which they can allocate
any amount to a central pot, keep it themselves, or split
their endowment between the two options. All contribu-
tions to the central pot are multiplied by 1.5, and then
divided evenly among the participants. In this set-up, it is
individually rational to defect and keep one's entire endow-
ment. However, we suggest that due to the salience of the
Kingdom, our treatment conditions may cause individuals
to select the socially optimal solution and contribute a
greater portion of their endowment to the public goods pot.
At this point, our design diverges from the classic public
goods game set-up. In addition to the contributions being
divided evenly and returned to the players, in our design
participants are informed that all contributions would be
matched and given to a charitable organization. This does
not alter the individual payouts that would be received from
a standard public goods game. There are three groups or
experimental conditions, to which participants were
assigned at random. The first, or secular condition, is that all
contributions to the central pot would be matched, and the
sum donated to a local school that caters to orphans and
other disadvantaged children within Nansana district (the
location of our experiment). Any individual who chooses to
contribute could also opt to receive a certificate bearing
their name, the seal of the school, and the amount of their
4 Research and Politics 
donation. The second, or horizontal condition, also matches
each player's contribution to the pot, but instead donates the
money to the BUCADEF. In this condition, respondents are
also given the choice to receive a certificate closely resem-
bling the original, bearing their name, the original Buganda
Kingdom seal, and the amount of their contribution.4 The
final, or vertical condition, also matches each player's con-
tribution to the pot and donates the money to the BUCADEF,
but instead of a certificate, the player is given the choice to
sign a letter to the Director of the BUCADEF, disclosing
their name and the amount that they contributed.5 These
conditions are summarized in Table 1, and the materials
(i.e., sample certificates in Luganda and letter in English)
provided to the recipients are shown in Figure 1 (Panels 1
and 2) and Figure 2.
The control condition--that is, where matched contribu-
tions to the public goods game are provided to the local
school--is designed to isolate the effect of altruism. In
other words, this allows us to distinguish whether or not
respondents are responding to an explicitly ethnic appeal to
contribute to a good cause, or whether they only wish to
contribute to local public goods provision, and are indiffer-
ent as to the ethnic character of that contribution.
The first treatment, corresponding to the horizontal
hypothesis, is ecologically valid, due to the previously dis-
cussed policy of the BUCADEF providing similar certifi-
cates to benefactors. We argue that this proxies peer-to-peer
effects, as individuals can only display the certificates to
friends and acquaintances, thereby signaling their commit-
ment to the ethnic institutions, but not garnering them spe-
cial favor with representatives of the Kingdom. Our
argument is that this provides the potential for a positive
inducement towards cooperation, as individuals receive a
psychological utility for contributing to the Kingdom's
efforts and receiving an official certificate from the
Kingdom, and/or that individuals receive a social utility
from displaying this certificate, which would be widely
recognized throughout the territorial jurisdiction of the
Kingdom, to members of their social network.
The second treatment does the opposite. The letters were
collected at the end of the game and hand delivered to the
head of the BUCADEF. This does not allow the individual
to signal to their peers that they contributed to the ethnic
institution, but instead allows them to potentially curry
favor, receive recognition, or encourage service provision
by Kingdom institutions. It is this potential for future ser-
vice delivery, or the chance to make a contact with a power-
ful agent of the Kingdom, that we suggest will induce
cooperation under the vertical hypothesis. It is important to
note that our design somewhat differs from findings by oth-
ers studying traditional leaders, in that the design itself, due
to anonymity concerns, explicitly rules out the chance for
retribution or negative inducements towards cooperation
(Gottlieb, 2017; Mares and Young, 2016). Therefore, the
appeal to traditional institutions under the vertical condi-
tion only contains the potential for positive, or reciprocal,
inducements to cooperate, and precludes the possibility that
individuals would be sanctioned for their lack of
contribution.
A similar condition, that is, a letter provided to the school
headmaster was deemed unnecessary, as the headmaster was

present when we played the games, in the general intake
area, but was not present in the room where the actual games
were being played.6 This allowed individuals who donated
to the school to discuss their contributions with him, thereby
obviating the need for a formal letter. The dual effect of the
control condition, providing both peer-to-peer and vertical
recognition of a contribution to a secular institution, biases
against a finding in either of the BUCADEF conditions.
Discussion of the design
Before turning to the analysis, we ease two possible con-
cerns with our design at the outset. The first would be that
respondents were induced to contribute, not, as we hypoth-
esize, to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the
Baganda polity (the vertical condition), or benefits they
would receive from displaying the certificate to their peers
(the horizontal condition), but rather by the threat of social
sanctioning. We argue that these concerns are misguided.
Contributions were made confidentially, with only the enu-
merator able to determine the amount each individual con-
tributed. Furthermore, certificates were handed out after the
experiment concluded, and on an individual basis. Finally,
during this entire process, no names were ever recorded.
The only exception--if an individual chose to provide his
or her name on the letter to the BUCADEF--would have
taken place after the game concluded. The lack of names
and the secrecy with which contributions were recorded
strongly minimized the threat of sanction as a potential
mechanism driving our results.
The second, and perhaps more serious matter, is that we
do not have a fully saturated design by eschewing a sepa-
rate secular analogue to the vertical condition. The concern
here may be that treatments included only a letter to the
BUCADEF, and, because they were not provided with a
letter to the school, that this some how biases our findings.
Figure 2. Buganda Cultural and Development Foundation sample letter.
6 Research and Politics 
However, this was a conscious design choice on our part to
enhance ecological validity.As stated before, we argue that,
with the headmaster present after the debriefing, we create
a stronger control condition that potentially biases against
our results.
To illustrate our argument, it is helpful to consider pos-
sible confounding explanations that would explain a posi-
tive finding for the vertical condition. The first is that
respondents chose to donate more, not due to any features
of the Kingdom itself, but rather out of a sense of altruism.
By including the secular control condition benefiting the
local school, if altruism were driving our results, we would
expect even contributions among all conditions. A critical
reader might suggest that altruism is still driving our results,
however, as it produces greater contributions to the
Kingdom because individuals judge the BUCADEF as a
more reliable provider of community goods. If this were the
case, then we would expect even contributions in both the
vertical and horizontal conditions.
The only plausible confounding relationship that would
produce a false positive finding in favor of the vertical
condition would be that individuals have a strong prefer-
ence to write letters, for the sake of writing letters. For
example, one could argue, if there was an increase in con-
tributions under the horizontal treatment, this could be
explained by people merely preferring certificates, which
could have some utility in and of themselves. This is why
we provided a similar treatment for the horizontal condi-
tion. However, we see no reason to suspect that individu-
als value a letter, a copy of which they do not get to keep
or ever see again, for the sake of a letter itself, and rather
eschew an analogous, secular control for the vertical treat-
ment. In other words, our assumption is rather that the
letter is useful only insofar as it allows access to social
hierarchies that the respondent deems advantageous,
which is exactly the theoretical mechanism that we pro-
pose under the vertical hypothesis. For this effect to be
observed without the social-hierarchy explanation being
true, there would have to be a plausible explanation for
people preferring to contribute under the vertical condi-
tion independent of: (a) altruism; (b) ethnic affiliation (as
this would suggest equal contributions under both the ver-
tical and horizontal treatment); or (c) perceived social
pressure from other participants (since the contributions
under the vertical and horizontal treatments go to the same
place, it is assumed that any social desirability bias
towards increasing contributions would be the same).
Analysis
The results confirm the vertical hypothesis, and show no
significant difference (substantively or statistically) for the
horizontal hypothesis. Table 2 provides the mean and stand-
ard deviations of the outcome, or the amount of money con-
tributed by each individual during the public goods game.
Each of the three experimental conditions consisted of 75
individuals, each randomly assigned to playing one round
of the public goods game ­ thus, overall our experiment
involved 225 participants. Figure 3 shows the distribution
of the outcome, as well as the horizontal and vertical condi-
tions. This figure shows that the larger mean of the vertical
group is largely due to the increased density in the amount
of individuals that contributed their entire endowment,
which is the social optimum of the public goods game. This
is reassuring, because it suggests that increased cooperation
is actually leading to greater payouts to all members, and is
not about sacrificing individual benefit. Furthermore, this
gives us confidence that participants understood the game
and correctly weighed their incentives.
In addition to the Student's t-test, we avoid making par-
ametric assumptions by using a permutation test to com-
pare the observed values from the experiment with
potential other draws from the resampled outcome distri-
bution. As discussed in the design section, each individual
in the experiment was randomly assigned to one of the
experimental conditions. The permutation test re-assigns
experimental conditions for the 225 other values resam-
pled from the outcome distribution. In other words, a per-
mutation test mimics the logic of counterfactual analysis,
by illustrating the distribution of outcomes if respondents
in the control group were assigned treatment and vice
versa. Unlike a t-test, which assumes a sampling distribu-
tion in order to generate null-hypothesis significance tests,
a permutation test rebuilds a sampling distribution from
observed data. In this regard, it is similar to bootstrap or
jacknife methods of inference.
The logic of the permutation test is illustrated in Figure
4, which confirms the earlier result: there is no discernible
or significant difference in average contributions in the
horizontal condition, but there is a significant and positive
shift in contributions in the vertical group. Figure 4 dis-
plays the sampling distribution calculated by resampling
2000 times from observed outcomes, and then shuffling
treatment and control conditions to obtain a distribution of
potential effect sizes. The blue line illustrates the observed
effect given the actual assignment of treatment and control
conditions. As is evident from Figure 4, this effect in the
vertical condition represents one of the strongest possible
effects given the observed data, where it falls roughly in the
center for the horizontal condition.

Discussion and conclusion
Signaling to constituents the involvement of traditional
institutions and their representatives in collective action
may indeed increase cooperation among individuals (H
1
).
The presented results suggest the relevance of the mecha-
nism put forward in hypothesis H
2.2
: vertical signaling
between ethnic constituents and traditional institutions can
be a crucial instrument for collective action. This speaks to
studies assuming the path dependence of pre-colonial polit-
ical setups and related effects on public goods provision
today (e.g., Gennaioli and Rainer, 2007). Our analysis of
the vertical mechanism contributes to the understanding of
the contemporary significance of traditional political insti-
tutions and how they assure individuals to take part in
collective action and the provision of public goods. These
theoretical and empirical claims are corroborated by recent
events, for example, the involvement of the Mogho Naba,
king of the Mossi, in the deal to re-establish an administra-
tion after a military takeover in Burkina Faso.7 We find no
significant difference in effects for hypothesis H
2.1
on the
horizontal signaling between constituents for mobilization.
Overall, this may indicate that the identification mecha-
nism primarily runs between constituents and the tradi-
tional polity, rather than between constituents.
Our findings and theoretical propositions show the
potential for further exploration of the link between tradi-
tional institutions, social cooperation, and mobilization.
First, moving forward, similar dynamics could be tested
Figure 3. Outcome distribution.
8 Research and Politics 
Figure 4. Permutation test for vertical and horizontal groups.
across ethnic groups with varying degrees of organiza-
tional hierarchy. Second, the mobilization potential of tra-
ditional institutions could be compared with those of other
actors, such as state or religious authorities. Our findings
regarding traditional institutions' role point to the more
general potential of other recognized cultural institutions
and their representatives to solve collective action prob-
lems in their communities, for example, religious leaders.
Such knowledge could be informative for practitioners
trying to involve stakeholders for development purposes.
Third, it may be insightful to compare whether traditional
authorities do not only increase mobilization with their
co-ethnics, but also among non-co-ethnics in the same
community, reflecting previous findings of Ichino and
Nathan (2013).

Notes
1. Throughout the manuscript, we follow the local custom and
denote the individual constituent of the Buganda Kingdom
as Muganda and the ethnic group or several constituents as
Baganda. Similar conventions apply to other ethnic groups,
for example, the Toro Kingdom constituents are described as
Mutoro (sing.) and Batoro (pl.).

Cultural and Development Foundation kindly provided us with
the original certificate design; the experimental certificate ver-
sion also included a validating signature from one of us.
5. To be sure, in each of the three separate treatment conditions, opt-
ing for a certificate/letter was entirely voluntary, that is, no par-
ticipant was forced or encouraged to accept a certificate or sign
a letter, and their choice was not communicated to other partici-
pants. Thus, concerns, for example, about subjects contributing
because they feared negative consequences of non-contributing
can be excluded. In fact, all participants who contributed in the
letter treatment also opted to sign, which in our eyes shows the
trust participants have in the Buganda Cultural and Development
Foundation and Buganda Kingdom institutions.
6. To provide further context: we used one school block, consist-
ing of four classrooms, for the experiment. The headmaster's
office is attached to that block of classrooms. Following the
experiment, we provided a tent with some refreshments as an
enumerator answered any questions and provided reimburse-
ment money for transportation costs. This tent was situated
directly across from the headmaster's office, who was present
during the entire weekend that the experiment was conducted.
