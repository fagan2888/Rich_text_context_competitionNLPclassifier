Introduction
As a nation, obesity prevalence data indicate Americans not
only are failing the objectives set forth in Healthy People 2010
(1), but achievement of national health goals may still be dec-
ades away reflecting what is now commonly known as the
American obesity epidemic (1­3). In fact, newer cohorts are
developing obesity and related health risks at an accelerated
rate compared to earlier generations (4). Youth and young
adults may be the key to improving overall health in the United
States and should be prime targets of prevention efforts (4) as
obesity rates double during the transition from adolescence to
adulthood with recent studies indicating rates may even 
triple
(3,5). Obesity has been associated with >50 various health
issues and comorbidities, and individuals are being treated for
obesity-related health problems at increasingly younger ages
(2,6,7). Although childhood obesity and illness are a major
concern, illness and disease prevalence may be more devas-
tating as at-risk youth emerge into adulthood, a period when
physical activity declines and obesity has greatly increased
(5,8). Thus, researchers currently are focused on the variety of
specific health deficits and developmental trajectories associ-
ated with obesity that are less understood beyond prevalence
statistics (9).
An estimated 1.6 million adolescents reach obese status
prior to age 18 and three million adolescents either become
or remain obese as they transition to young adulthood; <1%
of that number move out of the obese BMI range (10,11). The
purpose of the current research is to examine the relation-
ship between obesity trajectories and physical health from a
developmental and cohort-specific standpoint. Specifically,
it is unknown how obese and nonobese individuals differ in
regard to physical health during the transition to young adult-
hood. Cohorts of interest include individuals obese during
adolescence only, those obese during young adulthood only,
those obese during both developmental periods (i.e., continu-
ously obese), and young adults who were never obese. For the
purpose of this study, these different experiences of obesity are
referred to as obesity categories. Results will illustrate what
Weight Status Continuity and Change From
Adolescence to Young Adulthood: Examining
Disease and Health Risk Conditions
Michael J. Merten1
This study examined weight status during adolescence and young adulthood, and young adult health condition
diagnosis. Data are from 10,439 African-American, Hispanic, and white men and women participating in the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health during Waves 1 (adolescence: ages 12­19) and 3 (young adulthood: ages
19­26). Categories were created differentiating individuals based on their weight status during adolescence and young
adulthood: (i) obese during adolescence and young adulthood (i.e., continuously obese), (ii) obese during adolescence
only, (iii) obese during young adulthood only, and (iv) never obese. Multilevel random intercept regression models
were used to examine the impact of obesity category, sex, and race/ethnicity on young adult asthma, diabetes, high
cholesterol, and high blood pressure. Continuous obesity increased the likelihood for young adult disease and health
risk conditions compared to individuals who were never obese. Obesity isolated to adolescence (Wave 1) increased
the likelihood for high cholesterol and high blood pressure, whereas obesity isolated to young adulthood (Wave 3)
also increased the likelihood for diabetes--all increases were relative to nonobese weight status during both periods.
Associations varied in direction and degree when sex and race/ethnicity were considered. Findings clarify some of the
mixed understandings regarding the associations between age of onset and stability of obesity, and health outcomes
with important public health implications. Although results indicate obesity isolated to a single developmental period
does have health repercussions, obesity experienced continuously during adolescence and young adulthood greatly
intensified risk across all health conditions.

relative influence each category has on disease and health risk
conditions in young adulthood. Similar methods of chrono-
logically categorizing obesity status have been used in previous
studies examining relative influence of developmental weight
status on future outcomes (11,12).
The link between obesity and physical health is complex and
can vary by sex, ethnicity, age, and biological or genetic 
factors
(13). African Americans are consistently over-represented in
reports of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and related con-
ditions, particularly black women (14). Prevalence of poor
health also varies between men and women, regardless of race.
Men generally exhibit increased prevalence for the majority
of heart-related conditions (14,15), whereas women are more
likely to develop asthma, particularly if they are or have ever
been obese (16), and physical activity does not appear to lower
this risk (17). Therefore, investigators will stratify analyses
by sex and race because, although excess weight and obesity-

related risk of poor health are stable across demographics, the
intensity of risk varies based on these factors (4,18,19).
Previous findings are mixed, and it is still unclear what
relative influence age of onset and stability of obesity has for
future health outcomes (9,10,20). Identifying when obesity has
the strongest impact on adult physical health conditions and
disease is critical to the appropriate and effective design and
delivery of interventions aimed at improving public health. In
this study, researchers expect continuous obesity to increase
the likelihood of poor health in young adulthood more so
than obesity isolated to adolescence or young adulthood, or
never experienced during either developmental period. This
hypothesis is based on the proposition by Jeffreys et al. (21)
that, although obesity at any age increases the risk for adult
disease, cumulative health risks develop from persistent obes-
ity across the lifespan.
Methods and Procedures
Survey design
The data for this study were derived from the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health, a nationally representative study of adoles-
cents. Both adolescents and parents were interviewed at home, where
an array of information was obtained on health and lifestyle. This study
uses in-home interview data from adolescents and parents, collected
in 1995 (Wave 1) and 2001 (Wave 3). The Adolescent Health Survey is
comprised of data collected from a nationally representative sample of
high school students; data collection was based on a complex cluster
sampling frame. A sample of 134 middle and high schools was selected
through stratified sampling. The total sample size was 20,745. To ensure
diversity, the sample was stratified by region, urbanicity, school type
(public vs. private), racial composition, and size. Sample weights were
used to ensure the national representativeness of the sample. Further
details regarding the data set are available at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/
projects/addhealth.
During the time of Wave 1 data collection, adolescents ranged in age
from 12 to 19 years. At the time of Wave 3 data collection, the initially
interviewed adolescents were young adults as they ranged in age from
19 to 26. Interviews with 15,170 Wave 1 respondents were completed at
Wave 3. The Wave 3 questionnaire was designed to obtain relationship,
marital, childbearing, educational histories, and key labor force events.
Some questions were unchanged from earlier waves. To enhance longi-
tudinal measures, new sections focus on topics more relevant to young
adults. The Wave 1 sample included 55% whites, 22% African Americans,
16% Hispanics, 6% Asians, and ~1% Native Americans. About 51.1%
of the adolescents were boys and 48.9% were girls. For the purposes of
examining racial differences in the association of obesity status and health
conditions in young adulthood, the sample for the current study was
10,439. This included whites (6,245), African Americans (2,402), and
Hispanics (1,792) of whom 5,401 were female and 5,038 were male. The
mean age of the participants in this study during adolescence and young
adulthood was 15 and 22 years of age, respectively.
Study variables
Weight status. Adolescents' report of height and weight during Wave
1 allowed for the calculation of BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2). BMI has the advantage
of being very reliable and easily calculated. BMI also correlates well
with direct measures of excess weight in children and adolescents (22).
Importantly, BMI status also depends on age and sex. Reference BMI
percentile curves that enable age- and sex-specific percentiles to be
determined have been published by the Centers for Disease Control
(23) and are used to define overweight and obesity. Children or adoles-
cents with a BMI more than the 95th percentile for age and sex should
beconsideredobese.BMIhasgoodspecificitysothatitseemstoexclude
subjects who are not overweight or obese, but it misses some who are
obese (poorer sensitivity; 24). Adolescents with a BMI more than the
95th percentile for their age and sex during Wave 1 were 
categorized
as obese. The current study uses age- and sex-specific percentiles to

categorize adolescents as 0 (nonobese) or 1 (obese). In addition, to
compute young adult obesity status, a BMI of >30 was used. Based on
this, three dummy variables were created: D1 (1 = individuals obese in
both adolescence and young adulthood, 0 = otherwise); D2 (1 = indi-
viduals obese in adolescence but not obese in young adulthood, 0 =
otherwise); and D3 (1 = individuals not obese in adolescence but obese
in young adulthood, 0 = otherwise). Each dummy variable has to be
interpreted as the influence relative to the reference or comparison
group (
individuals not obese in adolescence and young adulthood).
Young adult disease and health risk conditions. Young adult

disease and health risk conditions were measured by participant's self-
reported responses to having ever been diagnosed with the following
diseases and health risk conditions during young adulthood: asthma,
diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. Participants were
asked the following questions: "Have you ever been diagnosed with...
(a) asthma... (b) diabetes... (c) high cholesterol... and (d) high blood
pressure?" Possible responses to these four questions were 0 = no or
1 = yes.
Race. Race/ethnicity was measured using self-reports from adoles-
cents. A set of two dichotomous variables (coded 0 and 1) was used to
contrast race/ethnicity categories of African Americans and Hispanics
against the reference group, whites.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences software (SPSS release 15.0.0, 2006; SPSS,
Chicago, IL). Before analyses were run, distributions of each variable
were examined for skew. All variables with skewness values 2s.e. above
or below the expected mean of zero were normalized by natural log
transformation before any inferential statistical analyses. In addition,
tests for multicollinearity were conducted among all study variables.
Subsequent tolerance and variance inflation factor values indicated
that multicollinearity was not a problem. The percentage of individu-
als reporting a particular disease or health risk condition by weight
category, race/ethnicity, and sex was compared across all participants.
Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for the probability that
weight status, race/ethnicity, and sex are independently associated with
the presence of disease and/or health risk condition in young adult-
hood. Two-way interactions among these factors were also assessed.
Subsequent logistic regression analyses were performed separately for

health outcomes by sex.
Results
A total of 6,245 white, 2,402 African-American, and 1,792
Hispanic adolescents with complete data across Waves 1 and 3 of
Add Health data collection were included in the study analyses. A
cursory examination of the data revealed never-obese individuals
had the lowest percentages of disease and health risk condition,
whereas those experiencing persistent obesity generally had the
highest percentages (asthma = 21%, high cholesterol = 10%, and
high blood pressure = 16%). Additionally, women appeared to
demonstrate consistently higher percentages of disease and risk
condition than males (asthma = 18%, diabetes = 1.48%, and high
blood pressure = 6%). Table 1 shows the percentage and number
of young adults at various levels of weight status, race/ethnicity,
and sex according to each health condition.
Table 2 presents results of factors contributing to young adult
health conditions. Individuals who were continuously obese
during adolescence and young adulthood were significantly
more likely to be diagnosed with asthma in young adulthood
than individuals who were never obese during adolescence or
young adulthood (OR = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (1.16,
1.51)). Individuals only experiencing obesity during one
developmental period (adolescence or young adulthood) were
not more likely to have asthma than individuals never obese

during either period. No differences regarding race/ethnicity
were observed. Females were more likely than males to report
having been diagnosed with asthma (OR = 0.85; 95% confi-
dence interval (0.79, 0.93)). There was a two-way interaction
between continuous obesity and sex. There was also an interac-
tion between individuals only obese during young adulthood
and sex. Table 3 illustrates the differing effects weight status
had on asthma contingent upon sex.

Regarding diabetes, continuously obese individuals were

significantly more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes in young
adulthood than individuals who were never obese (OR = 2.35;
95% confidence interval (1.65, 3.32)). Individuals only obese
during young adulthood were more likely to have diabetes than
individuals never obese during adolescence and young adult-
hood (OR = 2.14; 95% confidence interval (1.63, 2.92))--in-
dividuals only obese during adolescence were not more likely
to have diabetes. No differences regarding race/ethnicity were
observed. Females are more likely than males to report having
been diagnosed with diabetes (OR = 0.48; 95% confidence inter-
val (0.38, 0.61)). All possible two-way interactions among study
variables were tested, and there were no significant interactions.
Individuals who were continuously obese were significantly
more likely to be diagnosed with high cholesterol in young
adulthood than individuals who were never obese during ado-
lescence and young adulthood (OR = 3.14; 95% confidence
interval(2.56,3.82)).Individualsonlyobeseduringadolescence
(OR = 1.81; 95% confidence interval (1.22, 2.75)) as well as
those only obese during young adulthood (OR = 1.86; 95% con-
fidence interval (1.52, 2.27)) were both more likely to have high
cholesterol than individuals never obese during either period.
Hispanics are more likely to have high cholesterol compared to
whites (OR = 1.30; 95% confidence interval (1.03, 1.52)). There
was a two-way interaction between individuals obese in both
adolescence and young adulthood, and sex. There was also an
interaction between individuals not obese in 
adolescence but
obese in young adulthood and sex. Additionally, there was an
interaction between African-American status and sex. Table 3
illustrates the differing effects that weight status has on high
cholesterol contingent upon sex.
Continuous obesity significantly increased the likelihood of
high blood pressure in young adulthood compared to nonobese
weight status during both adolescence and young adulthood
(OR = 5.22; 95% confidence interval (4.44, 6.11)). Individuals
only obese during adolescence were more likely to have high
blood pressure than individuals never obese during adolescence
andyoungadulthood(OR=2.11;95%confidenceinterval(1.46,
3.06)). Individuals only obese during young adulthood also
were more likely to have high blood pressure than individuals
never obese in adolescence and young adulthood (OR = 3.19;
95% confidence interval (2.72, 3.74)). African Americans were
more likely to have high blood pressure compared to whites
(OR = 1.35; 95% confidence interval (1.11, 1.65)). No signifi-
cant two-way interactions were found among study variables
with respect to the outcome variable, high blood pressure.
Table 3 shows the ORs for factors associated with disease and
health risk conditions by sex. The results show that individu-
als who were continuously obese were significantly more likely
to have asthma; however, this was only found among women
(OR = 1.48 vs. OR = 1.10). Among men, obesity 
isolated to
young adulthood significantly increased the likelihood of
asthma (OR = 1.30; 95% confidence interval (1.11, 1.52));
however, among women, no differences were found. Regarding
high cholesterol, among men, those who were obese in both
adolescence and young adulthood were 3.86 times more likely
than nonobese men to be diagnosed with high cholesterol.
Among women, continuous obesity during both adolescence
and young adulthood increased the likelihood of high choles-
terol 2.39 times compared to women who were never obese
during both adolescence and young adulthood.
In addition, women who were not obese during adolescence
but obese in young adulthood were 1.35 times more likely than
women who were not obese during both waves to have high cho-
lesterol(95%confidenceinterval(2.72,3.74)).However,menwho
were not obese in adolescence but obese in young adulthood were
2.72 times more likely to be diagnosed with high cholesterol than
men who were not obese during both periods. African-American
men were significantly less likely than white men to be diagnosed
with high cholesterol (OR = 0.65; 95% confidence interval (0.48,
0.90)). There were no differences among African-American
women and white women in regard to high cholesterol.

between age of onset and stability of obesity, and adverse health
conditions. Prior studies conflict regarding whether obesity
elevates risk of poor health when experienced during adoles-
cence or when developed after adolescence (9,20). Results from
the present analysis suggest experiencing obesity, even when
isolated to a single developmental period, increased the risk
for disease in young adulthood. However, obesity experienced
continuously during adolescence and young adulthood greatly
intensifiedriskacrossallyoungadulthealthconditionsassessed.
In the case of high blood pressure, obesity continuing into
young adulthood more than doubled the risk. Results support
Jeffreys et al.'s (21) cumulative health risk hypothesis where per-
sistent obesity significantly enhances the relationship between
weight and health outcomes. It is not that obesity isolated to any
specific period of time does not incur lifelong physical health
risks, but that continuity of obesity greatly enhances the odds of
diagnosed health conditions. Obesity experienced early in life
not only creates a lifelong risk for poor health, but can promote
a chronic and intergenerational cycle of weight struggles (4).
Thus, findings are particularly concerning when considering
the high probability of an obese adolescent becoming an obese
adult, an obese parent, and then parent to obese children with
the odds of poor health stacked against them (4,10,25,26).
The association found between women and asthma is consist-
entwithpreviousresearch(16)--particularlyconsideringwomen
who were continuously obese. However, when examining asthma
risk for males, the only men 
demonstrating increased risk were
those obese during young adulthood. Asthma is an important
indicator of physical health because the condition can serve as a
"hallmark of severe disease and poor outcomes" (27) and often is
associated and shares similar antecedents with obesity (28).
Regardless of sex, obesity at any age increased the risk for
high cholesterol. Yet, when men's and women's health risks
were stratified by obesity category, it became evident that
obesity was especially detrimental for men whose odds of high

cholesterol were considerably higher regardless of when obes-
ity was experienced. Existing diabetes prevalence data have
mixed results regarding men and women. Although most
studies suggest men are at increased risk (e.g., 14,15), Mokdad
et al. (29) found that, overall, women were more likely to
develop diabetes. Present findings support Mokdad et al., but
when considering conflicting research, it is hard to contextual-
ize the importance of the difference. Sex differences in physi-
cal health ailments are a complex issue, and results from the
present analyses reflect this complexity, particularly when sex
and obesity categories were considered together. Macintyre,
Hunt, and Sweeting (30) urge researchers not to oversimplify
differences in health risk conditions between women and men
as they found direction and significance of sex differences to be
dependent on specific health condition, developmental period,
method of assessment, and country of study. Amid an array of
potentially arbitrary sex differences, obesity surfaces as an even
stronger predictor of young adult health ailments, especially
when experienced across multiple developmental periods.
Current health statistics paint a bleak picture of African-
American health outcomes (31). Recent data from the American
Heart Association indicates black women are at increased risk for
hypertension, stroke, heart failure, as well as general heart-related
disease (14). The same study found black women were less likely
to be physically active and more likely to be obese. Racial/ethnic
variations in young adult health risk conditions are yet another
demonstration of the complex relationship between individual
characteristics and disease. Overall, African-American status was
only a predictor of increased risk for hypertension in the present
study. Closer examination revealed that differences do exist, but
only when comparing African-American and white men and
women separately. One explanation for the lack of consistent and
pervasive race/ethnicity differences that have been observed in
previous studies (14,31) is that certain health risk conditions may
take longer to present among African-American populations; so,
even though risk or prevalence does not appear to elevate dur-
ing adolescence or young adulthood, that does not prohibit risks
from intensifying later in adulthood (e.g., 
obesity rates among
black men; 4). Although only small differences were found for
Hispanic participants compared to whites, this does not mean
they do not exist. Outcomes of this study were dependent on par-
ticipants' reporting they had been diagnosed with a health con-
dition. Researchers have found that Hispanic health conditions
often go untreated and/or undiagnosed (32) that, if true for this
sample, may have masked ethnic differences in health outcomes.
Limitations
Thereareseverallimitationsinvolvingself-reportdata
collection
that warrant consideration. First, BMI during both adolescence
and young adulthood were obtained based on self-report data.
However, this should not impair findings considerably as obese
individuals tend to underestimate their BMI--or BMI com-
ponents (i.e., overestimate height and underestimate weight;
33,34). Thus, significant associations found in the present
study would likely strengthen with objective BMI measure-
ment. Second, outcome variables also are based on self-report
in that participants reported whether they had ever been diag-
nosed with specific diseases and health risk conditions. Thus,
all respondents who answered "yes" to any of the conditions
indicated they had been tested for and diagnosed with the con-
dition by a medical professional during the Wave 3 assessment
period. Thus, outcomes are based on the diagnosis and not the
actual presence of a disease or health condition. This means
that participants, who have not been diagnosed with a condi-
tion and responded "no" to the outcome variable, may actually
have the condition. Additionally, obese individuals are more
likely to have been treated by a medical professional than non-
obese individuals due to obesity-related comorbidities (35).
However, this likely is only an issue for health risk conditions
that lack overt symptomatology (i.e., blood pressure, high cho-
lesterol) as more symptomatic conditions would likely prompt
medical attention. Future studies would benefit from a more
clinical approach to objectively assess physical health; how-
ever, such an approach was beyond the scope of the present
study. In spite of these limitations, findings from this analysis
highlight a promising direction for health research as well as
health education and intervention.

Conclusion
Results imply public health research and initiatives must become
more specific teasing apart individual characteristics to deter-
mine true correlates of poor health. Taking a one-dimensional
approach to health studies by isolating weight status, sex, or
race/ethnicity may obscure major differences among popula-
tions. Research needs to consider these variables in tandem
accounting for unique health outcomes based on a combination
of factors. Other variables such as education and socioeconomic
status may also interact with individual characteristics changing
relationshipsamongindicatorsandhealth(19).Healthinitiatives
and interventions can directly benefit from tailored knowledge
of health conditions--specifically, for whom certain diseases are
a concern and during which developmental period associations
have the most strength. This type of information will provide
clear direction for targeted awareness campaigns, health educa-
tion programs, as well as direct intervention efforts.
