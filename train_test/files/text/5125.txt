Background
Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common cardio-
vascular disease with a multifactorial pathogenesis. Recent
studies have confirmed that a large number of EH cases
are closely related to the development of inflammation.
Activation of inflammatory cells was shown to be involved
in the development of hypertension,1,2 and it has been
proposed that hypertension is a chronic, low-grade

Abstract
Introduction: Activation of T lymphocytes, for which potassium channels are essential, is involved in the development
of hypertension. In this study, we explored the inhibitory effects of telmisartan on the culture and proliferation of and
Kv1.3 potassium channel expression in peripheral blood CD4+ T lymphocytes derived from Xinjiang Kazakh patients with
hypertension.
Methods: CD4+ T-cell samples from hypertensive Kazakh patients and healthy Kazakh people were divided into healthy
control, case control, telmisartan, and 4-aminopytidine groups. Changes in the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-6
and IL-17 in the blood of the healthy control and case control subjects were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay. Peripheral blood CD4+ T lymphocytes were first activated and proliferated in vitro and then incubated for 0, 24,
and 48 h under various treatment conditions. Thereafter, changes in CD4+ T-lymphocytic proliferation were determined
using Cell Counting Kit-8 and microscope photography. Changes in messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression
of the Kv1.3 potassium channel in CD4+ T lymphocytes were detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction and Western blots, respectively.
Results: The IL-6 and IL-17 expression levels were significantly higher in the blood of the hypertensive Kazakh
patients than in the healthy Kazakh people. Telmisartan inhibited T-lymphocytic proliferation, as well as the mRNA
and protein expression of the Kv1.3 potassium channel in CD4+ T lymphocytes, and the inhibitory effects were
time-dependent, with the strongest inhibition observed after 48 h and significantly weaker inhibition observed after
24 h of treatment.
Conclusions: Telmisartan may potentially regulate hypertensive inflammatory responses by inhibiting T-lymphocytic
proliferation and Kv1.3 potassium channel expression in CD4+ T lymphocytes.

inflammatory disease.3,4 Animal studies have shown that
activation of massive inflammatory cells was obvious in a
spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model, and the acti-
vation was more significant in adult SHRs than in young
SHRs.5 In fact, massive inflammatory mediators are
upregulated in hypertensive patients, and their levels can
be used to predict the development of hypertension.
Inflammatory reactions in hypertensive patients are char-
acterized by the expression and activation of cytokines.6,7
T lymphocytes play an important role in the etiology
and development of hypertension and vascular remode-
ling,8 and they are important for immune regulation. It is
well known that T lymphocytes can be divided into two
subsets, CD4+ and CD8+. CD4+ T lymphocytes account for
35­50% of the total peripheral blood lymphocytes and
regulate the biological activity of the immune system by
secreting cytokines and expressing cell surface molecules.
CD4+ T lymphocytes secrete interferon gamma (INF-),
which can stimulate the expression of major histocom-
patibility complex (MHC) in endothelial cells (ECs) and
smooth muscle cells. This activates the antigen-presenting
function of ECs and initiates immune responses. INF-
also improves T lymphocyte migration through the EC
monolayer.
The activation function of T lymphocytes depends on
ion channels located on their cell surfaces. Studies have
shown that there are mainly three kinds of membrane ion
channels on T lymphocytes, a voltage-gated potassium
channel (Kv1.3), calcium-activated potassium channel
(KCa3.1), and calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC)
channel. In 1984, DeCoursey et al.9 reported the presence
of Kvl.3 potassium channels on T cells. The Kv1.3 volt-
age-gated potassium channel is essential for the activation
of T lymphocytes and is involved in some physiological
processes, such as T-lymphocytic differentiation and pro-
liferation.10,11 Kv1.3 on CD4+ T lymphocytes plays a key
role in lymphocyte activation in patients with acute coro-
nary syndrome.12 Opening of the Kv1.3 potassium channel
is essential for the membrane depolarization and mainte-
nance of the resting potential. It has been reported that
Kv1.3 is involved in the development of various diseases,
such as acute coronary syndrome, multiple sclerosis,
asthma, tumors, etc.13­20 The forkhead transcriptional fac-
tor FoxP3, expressed in T lymphocytes, is critical for the
production of angiotensin II, which is essential for the pro-
gression of EH.8 Some studies have shown that besides
lowering blood pressure, angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs), which are widely used to treat hypertension, also
have anti-inflammatory effects.21­24
Kazakh individuals are the second largest minority in
Xinjiang, and they have a high incidence of hypertension,
with EH prevalence rates of 40.5­52.39%.25 However,
rates of disease awareness, cure, and control appear to be
lower among Kazakhs than in other ethnic groups.
Therefore, studying the pathogenesis of hypertension in
Kazakh individuals has social significance. However, few
studies have assessed the effects of telmisartan, one of the
ARBs, on the proliferation of peripheral blood CD4+ T
lymphocytes, as well as messenger RNA (mRNA) and
protein expression of the Kv1.3 potassium channel in
CD4+ T lymphocytes derived from Xinjiang Kazakh
patients with EH.
In this study, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) to detect changes in the expression levels
of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-17 in the blood of hyperten-
sive Kazakh patients. We used magnetic-activated cell
sorting (MACS) to isolate CD4+ T lymphocytes from
peripheral blood of Xinjiang Kazakh patients with EH and
healthy Kazakh people. Then, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-
8) and microscope photography were used to analyze the
culture and proliferation of the CD4+ T lymphocytes.
Real-time quantitative reverse transcription­polymerase
chain reaction (qRT­PCR) and Western blotting were
used to determine the mRNA and protein expression
levels of the Kv1.3 potassium channel in the CD4+ T
lymphocytes. Our results may provide the theoretical
mechanisms and experimental evidence for the anti-
inflammatory effect of telmisartan.
Methods
Subjects
We selected Kazakh hypertensive patients and healthy
Kazakh people as the subjects for our experiments. Thirty
Kazakh hypertensive patients (mean age: 50.4±3.5 years)
and 10 healthy Kazakh people (mean age: 48.8±4.5 years)
attending the cardiology clinic of the First Affiliated
Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University were enrolled in
the study between January­August 2015. The healthy sub-
jects were all assigned to a healthy control group, while the
hypertensive subjects were randomised into the following
three groups: (a) case controls; (b) telmisartan; and (c)
4-aminopytidine (4-AP). There were 10 individuals (five
males and five females) in each group, and they were not
undergoing antihypertensive therapy.
The diagnostic criteria of hypertension, used as the
inclusion criteria, were as stated in the 2010 Chinese
guidelines for the management of hypertension.26 Briefly,
systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133
kPa) and/or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg, with-
out treatment with antihypertensive medication, were con-
sidered the diagnostic criteria of hypertension.
Subjects with the following types of diseases were
excluded from our experiments: (a) secondary hyperten-
sion; (b) cerebrovascular disease; (c) coronary, rheumatic,
or congenital heart disease; (d) acute or chronic infection;
(e) autoimmune disease; (f) important organ failure; (g)
diabetes; and (h) carotid atherosclerosis.
The study was conducted in accordance with the World
Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. All proce-
dures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the First
Huang et al. 3
Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University
(approval number 20141011-2), and informed consent was
signed by each subject before the trial.
Reagents
IL-6 and IL-17 ELISA kits were from eBioscience (San
Diego, California, USA). Human lymphocyte isolation
medium, recombinant human IL-2 (rIL-2), phytohemag-
glutinin (PHA), and 4-AP were purchased from Sigma­
Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, USA). The MACS kit was
from Miltenyi Biotec (Germany), and telmisartan was
from Boehringer­Ingelheim (Germany). Fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute
(RPMI) 1640 medium were obtained from HyClone
(New Zealand). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-
labelled mouse anti-human CD3 and FITC-labelled
mouse anti-human CD4 were from Becton, Dickinson
and Company (USA). TRIzol was from Life Technologies
(USA). The RT kit, Radio-Immunoprecipitation Assay
(RIPA) lysis buffer, protease inhibitor, bicinchoninic acid
(BCA) protein assay kit, and enhanced chemilumines-
cence (ECL) Western blotting kit were from Thermo
Fisher (USA). The real-time fluorescent qPCR kit was
from Qiagen (Germany). Sodium dodecyl sulphate poly-
acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS­PAGE) reagents
were purchased from Bio-Rad (USA). Anti-human mon-
oclonal antibodies against the Kv1.3 potassium channel
and -actin and secondary antibodies were obtained from
Abcam (UK). The 5-bromo-4-chloro-3'-indolyphosphate/
nitro-blue tetrazolium chromogenic reagent was from
Invitrogen (USA).
CD4+ T lymphocyte isolation
Peripheral venous blood (10 ml) was collected from each
subject into a heparinized vacutainer tube. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells were isolated using human lym-
phocyte isolation medium and density gradient centrifu-
gation. Using the Pan T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi,
Germany), human T lymphocytes were isolated by deple-
tion of non-target T cells (negative selection). Non-target
T cells were magnetically labelled with a cocktail of bio-
tin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies and the Pan T cell
microbead cocktail. They were retained on a MACS sep-
aration column in the magnetic field of a MACS separa-
tor (Miltenyi, Germany), while unlabeled T lymphocytes
passed through the column. The purity of the enriched T
lymphocytes was evaluated by flow cytometry (Beckman
Coulter, USA). The cells were fluorescently stained with
FITC­CD3 and analyzed using a MACSQuant analyzer
(Miltenyi, Germany). Cell debris and dead cells were
excluded from the analysis based on scatter signals and
propidium iodide fluorescence. The results showed that
>95% of the cells were T lymphocytes. T lymphocytes
were incubated with CD4 monoclonal antibodies. The
suspensions were then incubated with magnetic beads
coated with goat anti-mouse Immunoglobulin G (IgG),
which bind to antibody-coated cells. Subsequent expo-
sure to a strong magnetic field removed unwanted cells,
leaving the desired cell population. The cell-coated mag-
netic beads were resuspended in complete medium. Anti-
human FITC-CD4 was added, and the T lymphocytes
were analyzed using flow cytometry. The results showed
that >95% of the cells were CD4+ T lymphocytes, which
were used for subsequent experiments.
Cell culture
CD4+ T lymphocytes were seeded into 24-well plates con-
taining RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS, rIL-2, and
PHA and cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2
in an incubator
(Thermo, USA) for 48 h to promote T lymphocyte activa-
tion. The cultured CD4+ T lymphocytes were treated as
follows: telmisartan (final concentration, 100 mol/l),
4-AP (final concentration, 3 mmol/l), or an equal volume
of a dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) vehicle was added to
the culture media of cells from the telmisartan, 4-AP, and
control groups, respectively. The CD4+ T lymphocytes
were then cultured for 0, 24, and 48 h, and the suspensions
were harvested. Changes in the T-lymphocytic growth sta-
tus, shape, and quantity were observed and recorded by
microscope photography using an inverted fluorescent
microscope (Leica, Germany). Then, the samples were
divided into three portions, for CCK-8 analysis and extrac-
tion of RNA and protein, respectively.
ELISA assay
Peripheral blood (5 ml) from the healthy Kazakh people
in the healthy control group and from the hypertensive
Kazakh patients in the case control group was incubated
at room temperature for 30 min and then centrifuged at
3000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant serum was
collected and stored at -80°C. Then, levels of IL-6 and
IL-17 were analyzed in the serum using the ELISA kits
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both test
samples and standard samples were tested in duplicate.
Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate
reader (Bio-Rad). Then, standard curves were estab-
lished, and levels of IL-6 and IL-17 were calculated from
the standard curves.
CCK-8 analysis of T-lymphocytic proliferation
CD4+ T lymphocytes, precultured with PHA and rIL-2 for
48 h, were seeded into 96-well plates in 100 l of medium
(less than 2000 cells per well). The cells were treated with
telmisartan, 4-AP, or DMSO as described previously (eight
replicate wells per treatment) for 0, 24, and 48 h. After the
incubation, 10 l of the CCK-8 reagent was added to the
wells. The culture plate was incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2
in

RNA extraction and qRT­PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted from CD4+ T lymphocytes using
TRIzol, and the A260
/A280
ratios of the resulting RNA sam-
ples were approximately 1.8­2.0. RT reactions were per-
formed using 1 g of RNA at 42°C for 60 min, followed by
incubation at 70°C for 5 min. The total volume of qPCR
reactions was 20 l, including 10 l of SYBR Green PCR
master mix (2×), 2 l of cDNA template, 0.5 l of each for-
ward (F) and reverse (R) primer, and 7 l of H2
O. The
sequences of the genes encoding the Kv1.3 potassium chan-
nel and -actin (ACTB gene) were obtained from GenBank.
The primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech
(Shanghai). ACTB was used as an internal reference control
gene (Table 1). PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis were
performed with the cDNA templates, and standard curves
were established using the PCR products. The qPCR pro-
gram was as follows: 95°C for 5 min, followed by 39 cycles
of 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 30 s. Amplification efficien-
cies were approximately 90­100%. After qPCR, the ampli-
cons were separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The
data was analyzed using the 2-Ct method as follows:

Western blots
Total protein was extracted from CD4+ T lymphocytes
using RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibi-
tors. Protein concentrations were measured by the BCA
protein assay. Protein samples (20 µl=30 g) were mixed
with 5 µl of loading buffer, then denatured in a water bath
at 95°C for 5 min, and separated by SDS­PAGE. Then,
proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride mem-
branes, and the membranes were blocked with 5% skim
milk for 1 h. The primary antibodies were diluted as fol-
lows: anti-Kv1.3 potassium channel, 1:200; anti--actin,
1:5000. The blots were incubated with the primary antibod-
ies overnight at 4°C with shaking and then washed with
Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBS-T), fol-
lowed by incubation with secondary antibodies (both
1:4000) at room temperature for 1 h and washing with
TBS-T. Visualization of protein bands was performed by
the addition of 5 ml of the ECL reagent, followed by the
analysis using a Quality Image Analysis System (Bio-Rad).

defined as one or more family members (parent or sibling)
of the subject having hypertension.27 Smoking was defined
as a current or previous smoking history.27 Alcohol con-
sumption was defined as drinking at least once per week
for more than half a year.27
Levels of IL-6 and IL-17 in peripheral blood
The results showed that the expression of the inflamma-
tory cytokines IL-6 and IL-17 was significantly higher in
the peripheral blood of the Kazakh hypertensive patients
than in that of the healthy Kazakh people (IL-6: 61.0±4.1
vs 43.0±5.3; IL-17: 72.4±1.9 vs 50.8±2.6, respectively,
p=0.002) (Figure 1).
CD4+ T-lymphocytic proliferation
The cellular activities of the control groups significantly
increased, while those of the telmisartan and 4-AP groups
significantly reduced over time (p<0.05; Table 3).
Morphological observations of CD4+
T-lymphocytic proliferation with and
without drug treatment
CD4+ T-lymphocytic proliferation in the healthy
and case control groups stimulated with
PHA+rIL-2
There were obvious changes in the growth status, shape, and
quantity of CD4+ T lymphocytes, and these changes were
similar in the healthy control and case control groups.As the
culture time progressed, the cellular volume became larger,
and most of the cells were round or could be irregular in
shape, such as multi-tentacled. Cytoplasm vacuolization
was observed, and the cells aggregated to form a massive
T-lymphocytic mass. A large cellular mass formed by hun-
dreds of cells was visible under macrography, which indi-
cated that the cells were in vigorous growth. The aggregated
cells could easily be dispersed to single ones. There also was
a significant increase in cell numbers.
CD4+ T-lymphocytic proliferation in the
telmisartan group
Before the telmisartan treatment, the CD4+ T lymphocytes
grew in good condition, and there were no significant dif-
ferences with the cells in the control groups under microg-
raphy. After 24 h of telmisartan treatment, there were some
changes in the growth status, shape, and quantity of CD4+
T lymphocytes. After 48 h, the differences became more
obvious as telmisartan started showing an inhibitory effect
on T-lymphocytic proliferation. The cellular activity
became weaker, the cell numbers were significantly
reduced, and there was scattered cell debris, which was
apoptotic, on the bottom of the culture dish.
CD4+ T-lymphocytic proliferation in the 4-AP
group
At 0 h, the CD4+ T lymphocytes had good cellular activity,
and there were large numbers of cells, with large round cells
densely populated. At 24 h of 4-AP treatment, the cell num-
bers were slightly reduced, but there was still some aggre-
gated T-lymphocytic mass, which was sensitive to PHA. The
cellular volume became smaller, and there was some cell
debris deposited on the bottom of the culture dish. At 48 h,
the cell numbers were significantly reduced, and cell debris,
which was apoptotic, could be observed on the bottom of the
culture dish. There were scattered single cells and some
small cell mass of aggregated cells with a low cellular

Effect of telmisartan and 4-AP on
mRNA expression of Kv1.3 potassium
channel in CD4+ T lymphocytes
Expression of Kv1.3 potassium channel mRNA in the
peripheral blood CD4+ T lymphocytes was examined in
the four experimental groups. Amplicons of the correct
size were observed after agarose gel electrophoresis. The
results demonstrated that the mRNA levels of the Kv1.3
potassium channel were lower in the telmisartan and 4-AP
groups after 24 h and 48 h of treatment than those in the
healthy control and case control groups (p<0.05). There
were no statistically significant differences in the expres-
sion of Kv1.3 potassium channel mRNA at different time
points in the healthy control and case control groups
(p>0.05). In addition, the mRNA expression levels of the
Kv1.3 potassium channel were significantly reduced in the
CD4+ T lymphocytes at 24 h and 48 h compared with the
levels at 0 h in the telmisartan and 4-AP groups (p<0.05)
(Figure 2). Telmisartan inhibited the mRNA expression of
the Kv1.3 potassium channel in CD4+ T lymphocytes at 24
h and 48 h by 47.2% and 78.5%, respectively.

demonstrated that the protein levels of the Kv1.3 potassium
channel were lower in the telmisartan and 4-AP groups
after 24 h and 48 h of treatment than those in the healthy
control and case control groups (p<0.05). There were no
statistically significant differences in the expression of the
Kv1.3 potassium channel protein at different time points in
the healthy control and case control groups (p>0.05). In
addition, the protein expression levels of the Kv1.3 potas-
sium channel were significantly reduced in the CD4+ T
lymphocytes at 24 h and 48 h compared with the levels at 0

Discussion
EH is a chronic, low-grade inflammatory disease with
abnormal activation of inflammatory cytokines and
inflammatory signaling pathways.3,4,28 Expression of
inflammatory factors causes vascular inflammation and
promotes development of hypertension, which further
changes the structure and function of blood vessels and
causes damage to the heart, kidney, and other target organs.
Harrison and Gongora29 have proposed that the release of
various lymphocyte cytokines causes vasoconstriction and
sodium and water retention, which further increases the
blood pressure to promote the development of EH.
Elevated IL-1 and CRP levels are also associated with
hypertension. Thus, it has been confirmed recently that
tumor necrosis factor alpha increased the activity of
reduced coenzyme II oxidase in polymorphonuclear leu-
kocytes, which led to oxidative stress, an inflammatory
response, and elevated blood pressure.30 Under various
conditions, activated T lymphocytes will produce multiple
inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-17.
Consistent with most studies, here we found that the levels
of IL-6 and IL-17 in peripheral blood were higher in
Kazakh hypertensive patients than in related healthy per-
sons, which indicated that there was an activation of
inflammatory cytokines in the hypertensive patients.
The T lymphocyte function depends on the electrical
activity of ion channels in their cell membrane.31 Studies
using patch clamps have suggested that Kv1.3 potassium
channels are the key effectors of the sustained activation of
CD4+T lymphocytes.32 The main effects of Kv1.3 potas-
sium channels are to maintain the membrane potential and
intracellular calcium signaling, which regulates the cell
proliferation and cytokine production. Kv1.3 potassium
channels are likely targets for the immune or bi-directional
prevention of EH and are associated with many clinical
diseases. Thus, Beeton and others33,34 studied peripheral
blood of multiple sclerosis patients and postmortem brain
lesions and found that the antigen-specific CD4+ T cells
were mainly CCR7­CD45RA effector memory T cells,
which exhibited increased expression of Kv1.3 channels.
Guo et al.35 detected increased levels of Kv1.3 potassium
channel mRNA in rat lymphocytes, suggesting that the
elevated expression of Kv1.3 on T lymphocytes plays an
important role in atherosclerosis in rats. Xu et al.14 found
that CD4+/CD28- T lymphocytes were potential immu-
nomodulatory targets in patients with acute coronary syn-
drome and suggested that selective blocking of CD4+/
CD28- T lymphocytes could be used to treat the disease.
Therefore, this study focused on Kv1.3 channels on CD4+
T lymphocytes derived from Kazakh hypertensive patients.
As a Kvl.3 potassium channel inhibitor, 4-AP can
inhibit the activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes
and regulate the cytokine production and immune
responses by inhibiting the Kvl.3 potassium channel.
Some studies have shown thatARBs can effectively inhibit
the Kvl.3 potassium channel, regulate the immunity
through anti-inflammation and antioxidation, and play an
important role as anti-atherosclerosis drugs. By observing

blocking of Kvl.5/Kvl.3 potassium channels in Xenopus
oocytes, Li et al.36 found that telmisartan blocked the open-
ing state of the Kv1.3 potassium channel, which is one of
the mechanisms that can regulate the immune system and
anti-atherosclerotic effects.
Data from our preliminary study37 have indicated that
the mRNA expression levels of the Kv1.3 potassium chan-
nel are significantly increased in lymphocytes of SHRs,
along with an elevated potassium current density, demon-
strating an increase in functional potassium channels in
SHR lymphocytes. Moreover, we have also previously
reported that the mRNA and protein expression levels of
the Kv1.3 potassium channel are significantly elevated in
lymphocytes from hypertensive Kazakh patients from
Xinjiang38 and that the Kv1.3 potassium current densities
in peripheral blood T lymphocytes of this population
were also higher.39 These studies support the concept that
potassium channels of T lymphocytes are involved in the
pathogenesis and progression of hypertension through
their role in T lymphocyte activation. We have also per-
formed studies demonstrating that telmisartan can block
Kv1.3 potassium channels in lymphocytes of SHRs in a
concentration-dependent manner.40 In addition, telmisar-
tan effectively inhibited potassium current densities in
peripheral blood T lymphocytes of Kazakh patients
with EH in a time-dependent manner.41 Hence, ARBs,
including telmisartan, have the potential to elicit potent
anti-inflammatory effects by blocking Kv1.3 potassium
channels on T lymphocytes, although the specific underly-
ing mechanisms remain unclear.
In the present study, there were no significant differ-
ences between the healthy control and case control groups,
which indicated that the findings reflect a general phenom-
enon characteristic of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Electron
microscopy revealed that after the incubation with 4-AP at
an effective concentration for 0, 24, and 48 h, the numbers
of CD4+ T lymphocytes were gradually reduced, their cel-
lular activity gradually lowered, the shape condensed and
gradually shrank, and many apoptotic cells could be seen.
qRT­PCR and western blotting revealed that after the incu-
bation with 4-AP at an effective concentration for 0, 24,
and 48 h, the mRNA and protein expression levels of the
Kv1.3 potassium channel in CD4+ T lymphocytes were sig-
nificantly reduced. The results showed that 4-AP had an
obvious inhibitory effect on T-lymphocytic proliferation, as
well as on mRNA and protein expression of the Kv1.3
potassium channel in CD4+ T lymphocytes, which indi-
rectly indicated that the Kvl.3 potassium channel is the key
factor of T lymphocyte activation. The 4-AP group was
used as a positive control group, and the telmisartan group
showed similar changes, although the changes in the
T-lymphocytic proliferation and mRNAand protein expres-
sion of the Kv1.3 potassium channel in CD4+ T lympho-
cytes were slower and weaker with telmisartan relative
to those in the 4-AP group. This indicates that the anti-
inflammatory function and inhibitory effects of telmisartan
on the T lymphocyte Kv1.3 potassium channel are unlikely
to affect the normal immune function in hypertensive
patients. The CCK-8 analysis, qRT­PCR, and Western
blotting showed that the cellular activities and mRNA and
protein expression of the Kv1.3 potassium channel in the
telmisartan and 4-AP groups were significantly lower at 24
and 48 h than at 0 h, with a slow, time-dependent, descend-
ing tendency. Compared with the data for the same time
points in the healthy and case control groups, the cellular
activities and mRNA and protein expression of the Kv1.3
potassium channel were significantly reduced in the tel-
misartan group. This indicates that the drug can effectively
inhibit the proliferation of CD4+ T lymphocytes, as well as
the mRNA and protein expression of the Kv1.3 potassium
channel. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of telmisartan
on the T-lymphocytic proliferation and mRNA and protein
expression of the Kv1.3 potassium channel were time-
dependent over a 48-hour period.
Nataraj et al.42 demonstrated that the angiotensin II type
1 receptor (AT1R) is strongly expressed on T lymphocytes.
AT1R can increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration by
activating T lymphocyte potassium channels, which trig-
gers the Ca2+-mediated activation of the calcineurin/
nuclear factor (CaN/NFAT) signalling pathway, leading to
T lymphocyte activation and proliferation. We conclude
that increased expression of potassium channels on CD4+
T lymphocytes enhances potassium ion efflux, and the
increased gradient of the electric potential on both sides of
the cytomembrane generates hyperpolarization to promote
calcium ion influx. This causes a transient increase in the
calcium concentration, with subsequent CaN-mediated
dephosphorylation of NFAT and activation of the CaN/
NFAT signaling pathway. The activated CaN/NFAT signal-
ling pathway mediates T lymphocyte proliferation and the
release of inflammatory cytokines to promote develop-
ment of hypertension. Telmisartan can inhibit T lympho-
cyte potassium channels, which results in decreased influx
of extracellular Ca2+ into the cytoplasm and inhibition of
the CaN/NFAT signalling pathway. Consequently, the acti-
vation and proliferation of CD4+ T lymphocytes are
strongly suppressed, which promotes an anti-inflamma-
tory environment.
Taken together, here we found that telmisartan could
inhibit the culture and proliferation of CD4+ T lympho-
cytes from Xinjiang Kazakh patients with hypertension,
as well as the mRNA and protein expression of the Kv1.3
potassium channel, to exert anti-inflammatory effects.
This suggests that hypertension is an inflammatory dis-
ease and provides experimental support for the anti-
inflammatory activity of telmisartan based on cellular and
ion channel biology. However, certain limitations exist in
our study. In particular, our experiments were performed
in vitro, and the number of subjects was insufficient.
Therefore, we plan to complete a clinical follow-up or in
vivo study to provide evidence for the antihypertensive
effects of telmisartan.
