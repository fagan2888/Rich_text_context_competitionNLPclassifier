Abstract
Laboratory ethnography extended the social scientist's gaze into the day-to-day accomplishment of
scientific practice. Here we reflect upon our own ethnographies of biomedical scientific workspaces
to provoke methodological discussion on the doing of laboratory ethnography. What we provide is
less a `how to' guide and more a commentary on what to look for and what to look at. We draw
upon our empirical research with stem cell laboratories and animal houses, teams producing robotic
surgical tools, musicians sonifying data science, a psychiatric genetics laboratory, and scientists
developing laboratory grown meat. We use these cases to example a set of potential ethnographic
themes worthy of pursuit: science epistemics and the extended laboratory, the interaction order of
scientific work, sensory realms and the rending of science as sensible, conferences as performative
sites, and the spaces, places and temporalities of scientific work.

Introduction
The 1970s saw the first ethnographies of scientific laboratories by early proponents of
Science and Technology Studies (STS). This body of work set about demonstrating the
local accomplishment and social construction of scientific knowledge. In this article, we
reflect upon our own ethnographic practice in biomedical laboratories and the wider
circuits of bioscientific work. Our aim is to provoke methodological discussion on how

to approach the complex ethnography of laboratories. We do not propose here to provide
any sort of `how to' guide on access, data collection or writing. Instead, we hope to help
attune potential laboratory ethnographers to some of the themes they may choose to col-
lect data about and to analyse. In doing so we take lead from Atkinson (2015), in that we
seek to identify `some generic phenomena, some generic social processes, that repay
close and systematic attention'(2015: 2). We do so through a set of ethnographic vignettes
that report novel findings from our own laboratory ethnographies to explicate certain
ways of thinking. Key to our perspective is the commitment to the interactionist tradition
in ethnographic work that focuses upon interactive practice and the detailed observation
of how scientific work is accomplished through interaction (Atkinson, 2015; Atkinson
et al., 2008).
We begin with a brief introduction to the STS tradition of laboratory ethnography
before outlining the specific field sites we have worked in that we draw upon later in the
article. We then articulate a set of related themes through which the ethnographer may
wish to situate their own fieldwork: the epistemic and the extended laboratory; the inter-
action order; sensory ethnography (both learnt and created); spaces, places and rhythms,
and the performativity of conferences. Each of these accounts develops themes articu-
lated in Atkinson (2015) by applying them in the context of STS through our own field-
work sites. Importantly, by stressing the themes interrelated nature, we re-emphasise that
good ethnography should never try to explain all that is observed through one explana-
tory mechanism, nor should it try to explain what is observed through every explanatory
mechanism.
Knorr Cetina (1995) claims the first published laboratory study was Thrill (1972),
although Lynch's 1974 fieldwork was the first true to the STS tradition (Lynch, 1985a).
She divides early STS work into (i) the controversy studies of Bloor (1976), Collins
(1975) and Barnes (1977) that looked at how scientists assert legitimacy for their knowl-
edge claims during disputes, and (ii) `the study of unfinished knowledge' that closely
inspects science in the making (Knorr Cetina, 1995: 140). This second group, led by
Knorr (1977) herself, as well as Latour and Woolgar (1986 [1979]), Lynch (1985a) and
Traweek (1988), most keenly employed the detailed ethnographic observation of day-to-
day work to document how normal scientific knowledge is accomplished. This given,
these authors still adopt different approaches to their laboratory studies, with Latour and
Woolgar employing the `anthropologist of science'(1986: 27) perspective through which
mundane scientific practice is treated as a strange and alien culture, in contrast to Knorr's
(1977) focus on understanding the scientific work as the scientists do. Lynch, a student
of Harold Garfinkel, pursued an ethnomethodological approach.
Hess (2001) labels all of these early studies `first generation' STS ethnography, with
their focus on `the way in which concerns with evidence and consistency were interwo-
ven with situationally contingent events, local decision-making processes, ... the inter-
pretative flexibility of evidence ... and other social or non-technical factors' (2001:
234). He contrasts this with `second generation' STS ethnographies that are orientated
towards social problems, with a wider range of field sites beyond the physical working
spaces of scientists to study lay groups, social movements, and political activities. The
work we describe here remains within the working spaces of scientists, fitting Hess's
204 Qualitative Research 17(2)
`first generation', and continuing an ongoing strain of STS pursuing ethnography within
laboratories (cf. Harrington, 2013; Sormani, 2014). Following Atkinson (2015), we
argue the importance of fieldwork, in our case in scientific workspaces, as a rewarding
and satisfying research endeavour, and we hope to inspire further work in this form. In
what follows, we articulate what to observe and how to think about scientific work-
spaces through examples from our own work.
In the remainder of this article we draw upon five of Neil Stephens' projects: (i) an
ethnography with an interdisciplinary team of stem cell scientists, engineers, and physi-
cists, who sought to produce novel imaging technologies for cell culturing; (ii) Neil's
current work in a laboratory developing robotic surgical tools to aid the implantation of
cochlear implants; (ii) a yearlong project seeking to sonify the culturing practice of cell
biologists in order that other scientists could better understand the protocol used through
sound alone; (iv) a four-year ethnography of the UK Stem Cell Bank, an institution that
holds all human embryonic stem cell lines in the UK and regulates their use (Stephens
et al., 2008, 2011); and (v) an ongoing eight-year study of scientists who seek to tissue
engineer meat for human consumption (O'Riordan et al., 2015; Stephens, 2013,). We
also use two of Jamie Lewis'ethnographies: (vi) a twelve-month study of a Huntington's
Disease research laboratory and animal house (Lewis and Atkinson, 2011; Lewis et al.,
2013; Lewis et al., 2014); and (vii) a laboratory conducting work in the genetics of neu-
ropsychiatric conditions. While our ethnographies have been conducted independently,
we have also written comparative work on Jamie's Huntington's disease (HD) study and
Neil's work in the UK Stem Cell Bank (Stephens et al., 2013). These two projects also
involved Paul Atkinson as a team member.
We report previously unpublished findings from these ethnographic sites as a set of
vignettes to provoke reflection on what laboratory ethnography can do, and how ethnog-
raphers can go about doing it.
Ethnography of the epistemic
The classic theme of laboratory ethnography is that scientific knowledge production is
an accomplishment and, as such, the epistemic is situated and cultural (Hess, 2001;
Knorr Cetina, 1995). While we believe ethnographic work can fruitfully move beyond
focusing upon this alone, it remains vital that this fundamental focus upon the epistemic
is not lost, and that new ethnographies continue to explore knowledge production as situ-
ated within new technical domains and new political contexts. The epistemic component
of laboratory ethnography was foregrounded in Jamie's work in a laboratory testing the
efficacy of cells grafts to alleviate symptoms of HD. The laboratory functioned through
a set of relations between four spaces: the `dry' laboratory, where mathematical analysis
is conducted; the `wet'laboratory, where experiments are conducted, and in this case, the
brains of rodents are analysed; the `clinic', where patients were enrolled into clinical tri-
als; and the `animal house', where rodents are kept, cared for, and prepared for experi-
mental procedure.
Central to Jamie's analysis is the production and use of what are known as `animal
models': animals - frequently rodents ­ that have been subject to physical
Stephens and Lewis 205
interventions and discursive and documentary regimes to configure them as models of
human disease states. Jamie was told that in the case of HD the disease is reduced to a
limited set of phenomena ­ for example, gait, attention span, balance - that are ren-
dered observable in the animal models. These models are induced using three main
strategies: inactivating an existing gene (knock-out rodents), inserting a foreign gene
(transgenic rodents), or making a non-genetic change (lesioned rodents), with each
strategy intended to mimic the observable cognitive and motor deficits of patients with
HD. As Jamie has shown elsewhere, typically establishing such equivalence involves
accepting good-enough solutions based upon the judgements and skillsets that inform
them (Lewis et al., 2013). Here, we analyse an instance when Jamie observed these
judgements and skillsets in action in the animal house while watching the training of
mice for a balance test.
A technician was busy with four small cages containing a mixture of normal and
transgenic grey mice. The technician explained that the next day she would be running
the test `for real' during which she would not know which ones were transgenic. For
now, however, it was fine for her to know as she focused upon training the mice to
walk up a raised thin ramp leading to a fixed box at the top. The ramp was tapered,
getting thinner as it went, allowing her to test the hypothesis that transgenic mice
would struggle with the ascent as their feet, mirroring some of the behaviours associ-
ated with HD, slipped off the beam. She explained to Jamie that initially the bar was
not raised, but the experiment did not work, because the mice simply remained at the
end they were placed. She suggested raising the ramp to encourage the mice to move.
As each mouse was placed with their tail facing the box (their heads facing away), they
were encouraged to turn and scuttle up the beam into the house where they would be
rewarded with a treat. The technician tested all twenty mice and timed their ascents,
with some moving with agility and others more clumsily. Jamie asked the technician
whether those that struggled to walk up the beam were the transgenic mice. She smiled
saying `yes, well, for the most part', but explained that some mice are simply not that
good at walking up the bar. Presumably, some mice, like some humans, are more com-
fortable with heights than others. The time data of all the ascents were sent to the PI to
run some statistics, with the technician explaining that the PI is `brilliant at finding
patterns in numbers'.
The role of technicians is often under-represented in the scientific process (Shapin,
1989). It was clear, though, that the technician's skills and judgements were paramount
to modelling aspects of HD in the laboratory. There are clearly multiple reasons why a
mouse may or may not walk up a beam swiftly with some of these nothing to do with any
genetic manipulation. As someone who has studied, cared for, and trained the mice, the
technician was able to provide further context about the mouse's performance, gaining
an insight into its personality, its walking ability, its likes and dislikes. This tacit knowl-
edge, gleaned from the day-to-day labour and skilled handling of animals, is constitutive
of the epistemic work of HD. In concert with the statistical and observational work of the
other laboratory spaces, the animal house, as part of the extended laboratory, contributes
to the accomplishment of scientific knowledge, which is made not discovered, through
situated and culturally informed practice. This is a well-made point in ethnographic STS,
but still one to which ethnographers should remain attentive.

The interaction order of scientific meetings
Central to the work of any ethnographer is the study of interaction. Team meetings are
key sites of the interaction order (Goffman, 1983); they are local and intimate encoun-
ters that deserve detailed ethnographic inspection. To achieve this, the laboratory eth-
nographer can draw upon the insights of conversation analysis, and analysis of the
embodied and material aspects of performance, without necessarily engaging in fully-
fledged conversation analysis transcript work (Atkinson, 2015). Neil's study with the
interdisciplinary group of stem cell scientists, physicists, engineers, and chemists
explored this in terms of the boundary-work and performative display of disciplinary
identity during the project's day long group meetings. Importantly, the account not only
argues that interdisciplinary work is performed, but details how this performance occurs,
and how asymmetrical relationships within it are embedded within a mundane interac-
tional grammar.
The meetings Neil observed were intended to bring together the entire consortium
(normally based in three separate campuses across two cities) to update each other on
progress, ensure all team members were getting the support they needed, check where
the group were in relation to their milestones, and to foster an interdisciplinary environ-
ment. They occurred every three months, with each hosted by a different disciplinary
group, in their respective departmental building. Such mobility was intended to capture
the sharing of disciplinary spaces and the non-hierarchical environment sought by the
team. Despite different geographical settings, the meetings retained a standardised pat-
terning in their temporal, spatial, and interactional structuring. While the rooms used
took various shapes - from long and narrow, to square - the team members frequently
formatted the furniture around a rectangle of tables, allowing each attendee to face each
other for discussion or face a speaking position and projector for presentations.
The meetings also retained a formal structure starting with a greeting by the Principal
Investigator (PI) who would remind the group of the milestones and the project timeline.
This was followed by two or three forty-minute talks from postdocs, followed by lunch
and then another two forty-minute talks, before a closing PI raises once more the mile-
stones set for the next three months. An informal structure also quickly arose featuring a
layered use of language based around disciplinary expertise. During presentations, or in
conversations addressing the whole group, speakers would typically soften the most eso-
teric terminology in an attempt to develop a mutually accessible repertoire. Often during
formal presentations, or during group discussion, subsets of more specialised discourses
would occur concurrently. The physicists, the engineers, or the cell biologists, would
have hushed conversations employing specialist terminology accompanied by gestures
such as moving the hands close to the face, and lower volumes of talk, to minimise intru-
sion of this disciplinary talk into the group space.
This layering of a shared group repertoire and closed specialist repertoire, the differ-
ing material and embodied practices that support them, and the occasional interruptions
that disrupt it, are both performative of, and responsive to, the doing of the interaction
order of this interdisciplinary meeting space. However, Neil notes it was clear that one
specialist terminology ­ that of cell culturing ­ held a privileged position above other
disciplines, in that the esoteric cell biological terminology interrupted and dominated the
Stephens and Lewis 207
shared discussion space more frequently, and for longer durations, than any other phras-
ing. Group esoteric physics discussions, for example, were held between few speakers,
rarely lasted long, and typically handed topic control back to the shared group through
repair work like `we'll discuss this later', accompanied by hand gestures identifying a
small subset of team members. In contrast, group esoteric cell biological discussions
could be extended, with turns exchanged between multiple speakers with expertise in
cell culturing unhindered by interruptions from others, or a sense that such language
excluded non-biologists. This asymmetric intrusion and turn-taking captures a moral
order within the team meeting; in this case, prioritising cell biology, but potentially
favouring other disciplines when found as a structural component of interaction in other
settings. The work of the ethnographer is to note not only its occurrence, but also the
mundane interactional features upon which its performance is based.
Sensory ethnography: learning what's sensible
STS is increasingly attentive to multimodality, with long standing interests in the visual
(Lynch, 1985b; Stephens and Ruivenkamp, 2016; Vertesi, 2015) recently being comple-
mented with a growing literature on the audible (Mody, 2005; Pinch and Bijsterveld,
2012), and new works focusing upon touch, taste, and smell (Alac, 2011; Greiffenhagen,
2014; Nishizaka, 2011).Afocus upon the sensory remains in ethnographic work, with some
reminding us to retain the long-standing tradition of sensory attentiveness (Atkinson,
2015;Atkinson et al., 2008; Stoller, 1989, 1997); while others promote the use of sensory
ethnography attuned to emplacement (Pink, 2015).
Neil has conducted two laboratory ethnographies that focus on how epistemic and
technical innovation is rendered sensible through interaction, employing the dual mean-
ing of sensible as both perceivable and comprehensible. The first is an example rendering
the imperceptible as sensible, and is based on an account of his very first encounter in the
robotic surgery laboratory.
The robotic surgical tool laboratory developed a range of devices, but the main focus
of their work at the time of the ethnography was a drill designed to cut through human
tissue (skin, fat, muscle) with high precision and the capacity to predict what tissue lay
just ahead of its current position. The primary purpose the laboratory developed it for
was to aid in operations to insert cochlear implants into the inner ear while reducing
damage to the hearing tissues.
Within the first ten minutes of being by the laboratory bench, Neil was shown the
robotic surgical drill. The silver handheld device was rectangular; around 16cm in
length, with a small drill bit extending a few cm from one end, with coiled wires run-
ning from the other end to a laptop perched above more computer hardware. It had
already been explained to him that, based upon existing modelling of tissue, the drill
and its software could predict what tissue type lay just ahead of it as it drilled into the
body basing its calculations on force and torque readings from the drill bit itself. In use,
the drill could be held by a surgeon pushing it into the inner ear and towards the sensi-
tive and important hearing tissue of the endosteal membrane. The one automated func-
tion of the drill was to stop, based on its prediction of the immediate tissue environment,
just as it touched the membrane, but without damaging it. This precision, Neil was told,
208 Qualitative Research 17(2)
would be impossible for a surgeon unaided. The measurements were imperceptible to
humans because they were so small.
Over the course of the ethnography, it became clear that the laboratory had a number
of strategies for rendering this imperceptible precision sensible. On day one, Neil partici-
pated in what had become something of a welcoming ceremony for visitors to the labora-
tory, and a key guided practice in experiencing the drill's sensitivity: the act of drilling
into an egg. The lead scientist retrieved an egg from the laboratory fridge, and demon-
strated how the tool could drill through the shell of the egg but would stop when it
touched the membrane that separated shell from the egg white without damaging the
membrane. Neil was then given the opportunity to try himself. Pressing the drill, as it
drilled into the eggshell, the soft vibrations of the tool were perceivable, as was the drill-
ing sound. Neil had never drilled into an egg before, and knowing how much pressure to
apply was not obvious. The scientist encouraged him to push harder as the shell pow-
dered and a small hole less than 2mm wide was created. Holding the drill straight was no
simple task for a complete beginner, and Neil had several aborted attempts as the drill
slipped, leaving half-finished holes in the egg's surface. The moment of the first success-
ful drill was marked by the predictive capacity of the drill itself, as its algorithms deter-
mined the membrane had been reached, and the drill, and its accompanying noise and
vibrations, ceased.
Removing the drill, the scientist gestured toward the successful hole as evidence of
the tool's precision. Neil, again demonstrating no native competency, was not sure what
he should see and how this confirmed anything. To him, the successful hole, and the
holes from the multiple aborted attempts, all looked the same. The scientist assured him
they were different, and took the egg to a microscope so the holes could be better
inspected. After a few moments of balancing the egg, finding the holes, and focusing the
microscope, the scientist invited Neil to view the magnified image, which again to Neil
appeared as a set of white circles. Explaining the image, the scientist provided an account
of how the white of the membrane was different to the white of the shell. Neil surmised
that, since this membrane tone of white extended continuously across the hole, that the
membrane was, as suggested, undamaged and that the drilling was successful.
This account then demonstrates just one strategy of how the drill's imperceptible
sensitivity is rendered sensible, both perceivable and comprehensible. This was accom-
plished through a choreographed demonstration based upon multi-sensory experience.
The sensory alignments of feeling and hearing the drill, seeing the white circles (by
naked eye and microscope), and having their interpretation narrated, was performative of
the drills capabilities. It invoked a particular interpretation of a sensory realm, which was
taught and enacted through interaction.
Sensory ethnography: creative sensory alignments
The second of Neil's ethnographies on the sensory in scientific work explored what those
involved in the project called `the Stem Cell Orchestra'. Here, Neil was both participant
in, and ethnographer of, the research team. The core interdisciplinary group consisted of
two musicians, two biologists, Neil, and a bioinformatician. Bioinformatics is a special-
ism that applies computing to biology, often in the context of `big data' (Lewis and
Stephens and Lewis 209
Bartlett, 2013). This project was based upon developing the team's in-house bioinfor-
matics software `ProtocolNavigator'. The programme was designed to replace cell biol-
ogists' lab books with an electronic version that could record the procedure of each
experimental protocol, share it with other scientists, and display the protocol via a novel
flowchart based graphical interface. The challenge of the Stem Cell Orchestra was to add
sonification to the software so that protocols could be translated into an audible represen-
tation as opposed to a visual one, and to articulate why the audible version improved
scientific practice. Like the robotic egg surgery example, this account again highlights
the sensory alignments required in sharing interpretations of an epistemically productive
sensory realm. However, the two cases differ in that while the egg example performed a
pre-scripted set of actions, interpretations, and sensitising practices, the Stem Cell
Orchestra case examples the creative production of a sensory realm and the interactional
encounters invoking the alignments that render their interpretation sensible.
Cell culturing research is usually conducted at a hooded cell culture bench. Cells are
seeded into wells in a plate, expanded within the well, harvested out of the well, washed,
and seeded again into new wells. During this ongoing reseeding process, drugs, dyes or
growth factors can be added to some of the wells (while others are left untouched as
comparative controls) to record what difference the added materials make. Experiments
can last several weeks, and typically involve short bursts of reseeding activity separated
by long periods of incubation during which the cells remain untouched. In this case, the
laboratory was working with cancer cells and adding the dye DRAQ7. As an ethnogra-
pher, Neil observed and audio recorded team meetings. As a contributor to the project
from an STS perspective, he articulated the challenges of recording, sonifying, and then
sharing an essentially tacit cell culture practice.
To help sonify the DRAQ7 protocol the musicians would first have to understand how
it worked. This involved lengthy discussions at team meetings and visits to the cell cul-
ture laboratory to watch and video record the experiment being conducted. They observed
pipetting, felt the warmth of the incubator, and knelt down to hear the clicking of the
fridge as it cooled down to the appropriate temperature. They asked questions, joked
about the complexity, and articulated the rhythms of seeding, harvesting, and incubating.
Back in team meetings, they would sit with synthesisers, pre-recorded sounds, or impro-
vised vocalisations to suggest soundscapes and earcons that capture both the essence,
and some epistemically valuable content, relating to the cell culture work (cf. Supper,
2015 on how sonification experts do similar in conferences).
Over the course of a year, a sonic repertoire of rhythms, melodies, and harmonic
ratios were developed that led up to a defining moment in the first feedback session,
when cell culturers from outside the core group joined a project meeting to hear the
results, and discuss whether they could make sense of them. During this meeting, a
novel sensory realm was articulated, through playing sounds, watching an accompany-
ing visual animation, conversation, and the embodied work of gesturing, humming, and
tapping out rhythms. Through these processes of in situ negotiation, the group agreed
that some key components of cell culturing practice were recognisable, and thus sensi-
ble, in the sonification, while others were said to be missing the mark. For example, the
rich sustained string sound was agreed to capture the warmth of incubation, and the
cymbal recognised as demarking the passage of time, although the exact amount of time
210 Qualitative Research 17(2)
remained unclear. Through re-listening, suggestive comments, and invocations of prior
experiences of laboratory work or musical environments, the group agreed on the par-
tial emergence of a sensible sensory realm; one in which new alignments between cym-
bal rhythms and hours of incubating, and piano chords and cell culture well plates,
made the sonification of bioinformatics cell culture protocol software a perceivable and
comprehendible practice.
As both the robotic surgery and the Stem Cell Orchestra examples show, laboratories
are sensory spaces, replete with both phenomena to be sensed and technologies that
sense. They are also sites of interaction and shared sense-making around the proper inter-
pretation and enactment of these sensory alignments. Laboratory ethnography offers the
opportunity to document not only the work these sensory realms achieve, but also how
they are accomplished through interaction. By attuning their analysis to a multi-modal
sensuousness the ethnographer can work to further extend the reach of STS beyond the
visual into the interconnections of sensory epistemics.
Spaces, places and rhythms
Ethnographic fieldwork is not conducted in vacuum, it is situated, and we should con-
sider the choreography of social life in these spaces (Atkinson, 2015). Space bannisters
­ simultaneously constrains and guides ­ social life and work, shaping the organisation
of everyday life in situ. The scientific workspace is no different in this regard to any other
place of work. Laboratory ethnography therefore benefits from attending to the rhythms
of day-to-day work, the movements and flows of matter and matters, transformations and
transitions, and boundaries and barriers.
Scientific work is accomplished, furnished and anchored in the laboratory. These
come in different shapes and sizes: some are large and spacious; others small and con-
fined, some are busy and heavily populated, others quiet and conspicuous by the absence
of workers. Many are gated communities; others are linked closely to clinics and hospi-
tals. Some are distant from the city and prying eyes (for example, the UK Stem Cell
Bank, Stephens et al., 2008) and some are transient spaces that pop-up as portable pack-
ages (Lewis et al., 2014).
To reflect the importance of place and space in biomedical work, Neil, with col-
leagues, coined the term performative architecture to describe how the organisation and
architecture of buildings reflects and frames the social actions within it (Stephens et al.,
2008). The UK Stem Cell Bank building is therefore simultaneously symbolical and
practical, performing aspects of cleanliness, sterility and safety. These ideas develop
upon Thrift (2006) who comments on the `radical redesign of scientific space, reflected
in the construction of numerous new performative buildings' (2006: 292). New life sci-
ence buildings such as these, he argues, are designed not only to intentionally produce
intense social action between scientists, but are also built to reflect the state and status of
bioscientific innovation.
Jamie's ethnographic work articulates another, different, example. He studied a group
working on psychiatric genetics that recently left their old laboratory space in an early
2000s building attached to a working hospital, to move to a purpose-built, state-of-the-
art construction, similar to those described by Thrift. Architecturally, the laboratory's
Stephens and Lewis 211
new building has clean lines and razor sharp edges symbolising the cutting-edge work
conducted inside. The glass exterior is not only modern but enacts the transparency and
accountability of the work inside. The cathedral like atrium on the bottom floor has a
large white space that performs openness, welcoming visitors and publics, yet the revolv-
ing access door means that guests cannot simply slip in unaccounted. There is also a
coffee shop, a large lecture theatre, two training rooms and a hub for postgraduate
research activity.
The building has a rhythm; weekday mornings and afternoons are the domain of the
researcher and support staff, public events are confined to late afternoons/early evenings,
and only the deadline or experimental protocol-tied researcher and the occasional secu-
rity guard are seen at night or weekend. The building also has multiple purposes: it is
home to a hospital research clinic as well as an out-of-sight animal house.
The different functions of the building's spaces are contested. The open plan offices
on floors 1, 2 and 3 are shared between the laboratory and another research institute.
They work to provide durability to the social networks, symbolising collaborative and
interdisciplinary research by creating a critical mass of expertise. Big science, we are
told, requires scientists coming together co-located in these innovative incubators
(Thrift, 2006). However here the symbolic and the functional come into conflict, as the
symbolic openness of glassless windows in the shared atrium allows the noise of mul-
tiple users to reverberate through the offices spaces upstairs. This is escalated during
late afternoon and early evening public events downstairs, in which film showings,
choirs, or school visits create an overlapping sensory realm of differing interpretations
of what constitutes reasonable noise. Staff complain about the volume inhibiting their
concentration, through informal conversations, emails, and formal requests for action.
Some seek alternative working spaces. This contestment overlays the hierarchies of the
broader institution. Senior researchers and academics are provided with their own,
quieter, offices, mid-career academics with shared offices, and early career researchers
are located in the hubbub of the open plan area. When the flows of noise lead to the
underuse of the building, the spare office space is offered to PhD students from other
departments, for whom space restrictions mean they have no desk in their own disci-
plinary spaces. In this way, the building becomes a different type of interdisciplinary
space, more performative of the frustrations of resource limitations and design blun-
ders than innovative capacity.
Spaces, places and temporalities are locally occasioned, locally ordered and locally
negotiated. Architectures, as physical things, give durability to the functional and sym-
bolic work imagined by their creators, but they retain some flexibility in the reconfigura-
tion of their physical and symbolic ordering, which occurs through the interactions of
people in, around, and through these spaces (cf. Gieryn, 2002). They can be contested
and reconfigured, be that through the simple rearranging of furniture in the `three
monthly meetings' or the move to install glazing in open plan areas. Ethnographers
should be attentive to these spaces, places and temporalities. In studying their choreog-
raphy and interactional forms orchestrated through them we see that place is always in
the making (Hurdley, 2015), often sedimented, but rarely settled; it is an accomplishment
worthy of study.
212 Qualitative Research 17(2)
Conferences as performative sites
Conferences are a key set of encounters in which scientific fields come together to inter-
act, yet they remain under-analysed in STS (González-Santos and Dimond, 2015; Supper,
2015). Claims and counter-claims are made, bonds are confirmed or broken, and new
ideas are presented as part of the pathway to rendering them legitimate and knowable.
Both presenting papers, and being an audience member, are types of performance that
require analysis of how they are put together (Atkinson, 2015; Dimond et al., 2015).
Eating spaces, hotel lobbies, and mingling opportunities are also important sites of sci-
entific work.
Conferences form part of the calendar, frequently on an annual basis, and, beyond just
presentations, host award ceremonies, early career researcher support opportunities,
journal editorial board meetings, and academic society AGMs. In established disciplines,
the conference works to reinforce a field's identity through performances of progress that
retain continuity with the past. They have a grammar, an interaction order, which is rec-
ognisable across multiple disciplines.
Here, we focus on Neil's research on a new, emergent, field: `cultured' or `in vitro'
meat. The technology involves the application of tissue engineering (a typically bio-
medical practice) to producing meat. Cells are taken from an animal (typically an agri-
cultural animal, but any animal is possible) and expanded under laboratory conditions
into larger quantities of muscle tissue that is then presented as food. Laboratory research
in the field began just after the millennium, beginning with as few as two laboratories
active and today perhaps as many as ten. The field had its highest profile moment in 2013
when the world's first laboratory grown hamburger was cooked and tasted at a London
press conference intended to publicise the potential environmental, ethical, and health
benefits of a meat made `outside of a cow' (O'Riordan et al., 2016). The field remains
small, and spreads across the university and private sector. Every so often, a new labora-
tory will display its latest prototype product accompanied by promissory accounts of
how close it is to commercialisation (often tempered by issues about how much future
funding could be made available). The field remains optimistic that progress is being
made and that initial high end products will be delivered in the near future.
Neil's work studies the ontological ambiguity of this technology to explore how the
field seeks to establish a stable categorisation of tissue engineered muscle as food and, in
some instances, as meat as we know it today (Stephens, 2013). Here, we explore the role
of conferences as key sites of this work as participants operate to produce a shared nar-
rative among themselves, and perform that narrative beyond the field.
Between 2008 and 2015, four key conference-like international events occurred in the
field. The second, the `European Science Foundation Exploratory workshop in In Vitro
Meat'was held in Gothenburg in 2011, with Neil in attendance. The event was genuinely
a meeting place; many of the scientists present had never met (or in many instances even
emailed) the scientists from other countries. The workshop's introductory character was
felt across the event through those initial handshakes, the presentations on preliminary
findings, and the closing press conference in which the technology was introduced to the
Swedish press.
Stephens and Lewis 213
The event featured an explicit conversation among attendees on the naming of
their technology and, by implication, their field. The merits of many names were
articulated, but the main contenders were the existing `in vitro meat' and the keenly
advocated for (by a small portion of attendees) `cultured meat'. More than `a name'
were at stake in this discussion, as the very status of the technology and the partici-
pants' research programmes were implicated. The term `in vitro' remained the prefer-
ence for some participants as it was seen as the scientifically accurate phrase. That
said, it was recognised that the term could alienate some people in a way less likely
with `cultured', which benefitted from the combined meanings of `cell culture', `fer-
mented' and `artistic or classy' (cf. Datar, 2015). `Cultured' was embraced by some
who deemed it more appealing to potential consumers, and was accepted by others
because the cell-culturing element meant it remained within a scientific repertoire.
However, it was clear many in the room would not accept a term that distanced the
science altogether; many present identified themselves as basic science researchers,
not marketers, and that any name would need to be of the scientific realm, with a
subsequent renaming of the technology to be led by a different set of professionals
(perhaps in public relations) in a future moment once the technology shifted from
research to commerce. As such, through the exchange on naming, the field were
defining themselves, the proper category of work they engaged in, and the status of
the technology and the tissue itself.
All conferences do work: they site interaction and perform and enact moments of
science-in-the-making. For the ethnographer, they provide valuable research opportuni-
ties whatever the status of the field. In studying what is accomplished and how accom-
plishment happens at conferences the laboratory ethnographer can only enrichen their
understanding of scientific practice and improve their studies.
Conclusion
Ethnography should be attentive to the diversity of practices, orders, and frames of inter-
pretation enacted in the contexts studied, while still producing a focused account that
does not try to explain everything through everything (Atkinson et al., 2008). This is true
of the laboratory as it is of any other field site. In this article, we have provided a set of
ethnographic vignettes intended to provoke reflection upon some of this diversity, while
retaining a focus upon how scientific work is accomplished through interaction, set in
and through spaces, places and rhythms, including the extended laboratory and the con-
ference. We have no problem with Hess' second wave of STS ethnography moving
beyond the laboratory and encourage this work, although we do not report on it directly
here. Instead, we have reasserted the classic STS focus on the epistemic context of
knowledge in the making and controversial science, while emphasising the interaction
order and the sensory realm. We have done so to provoke laboratory ethnographers to
consider the structural forms that routinely shape scientific practice in their own work. In
this regard, the article is a call for the continued reinvigoration of laboratory ethnogra-
phy. We hope people will be confident in their ethnography, attentive to diversity, and
continue to produce ethnographically grounded STS.
