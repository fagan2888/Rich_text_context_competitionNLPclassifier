Indian paradox:
Rising education, declining women's employment

Abstract
BACKGROUND
Theories of human capital would suggest that with more education, women acquire
greater skills and their earnings increase, resulting in higher labor force participation.
However, it has been long known that in India, women's education has a U-shaped
relationship with labor force participation. Part of the decline at moderate levels of
education may be due to an income effect whereby women with more education marry
into richer families that enable them to withdraw from the labor force.
OBJECTIVE
The paper uses the first comprehensive Indian income data to evaluate whether the
other family income effect explains the negative relationship between moderate
women's education and their labor force participation.
METHODS
Using two waves of the India Human Development Survey, a comprehensive measure
of labor force participation is regressed on educational levels for currently married
women aged 25­59.
RESULTS
We find a strong other family income effect that explains some but not all of the U-
shape education relationship. Further analyses suggest the importance of a lack of
suitable employment opportunities for moderately educated women.
CONCLUSION
Other factors need to be identified to explain the paradoxical U-shape relationship. We
suggest the importance of occupational sex segregation, which excludes moderately
educated Indian women from clerical and sales jobs.

1. Introduction
The low rates of Indian women's labor force participation have long been a magnet for
academic inquiry. Most recent studies have noted the generally J-shaped or U-shaped
relationship of women's education with their labor force participation (Reddy 1979;
Sathar and Desai 2000; Das and Desai 2003; Kingdon and Unni 2001; Das 2006;
Klasen and Pieters 2015). As national participation rates have continued to decline over
the last few decades (Abraham 2013; Chatterjee, Murgai, and Rama 2015), cohort shifts
out of low levels of education to intermediate and secondary education have been
blamed for much of this decline (Afridi, Dinkelman, and Mahajan 2016).
Nevertheless, the curvilinear relationship itself has received surprisingly little
direct research attention. Most studies note the U-shaped relationship, but they usually
fail to take the next step of trying to explain it empirically. This is especially surprising
since the downward sloping part of the curve is so counter-theoretical. Neoclassical
theory predicts that increases in women's education should usually lead to a rise in
women's labor force participation rate. More education makes you more productive, so
your potential earnings rise, creating a greater incentive to join the labor force and
substitute employment for leisure or home labor.
India is unusual but not unique for having lower rates of labor force participation
among adult women with secondary education. Among 71 countries with appropriate
census data in the IPUMS-I data archive (Minnesota Population Center 2017), only 14
countries have lower rates of labor force participation for adult women with secondary
education than for women who complete less than primary school. India has the second
largest gap (19% vs. 35%), exceeded only by Rwanda (72% vs. 92%). But several other
countries also show lower rates of labor force participation for secondary educated
women (e.g., Indonesia, 47% vs. 63%; Turkey, 34% vs. 46%; and Ghana, 76% vs.
84%). So, this counter-theoretical result deserves more research attention than it has
been given.
Past studies have suggested that both cultural factors, such as norms restricting the
mobility of women, and structural factors, such as a lack of appropriate job
opportunities for educated women, play important roles in determining the U-shaped
relationship between women's education and labor force participation in India (Das and
Desai 2003; Das 2006). But these cultural and structural explanations are more often
asserted than tested.
Theory also predicts that the relationship between education and employment is
governed by both an income and a substitution effect. The substitution effect implies
that educated women command higher wages that would encourage them to substitute
participation in the labor force for leisure or home work. The income effect, on the
other hand, posits that educated women have higher incomes for the same amount of
Demographic Research: Volume 38, Article 31
http://www.demographic-research.org 857
work, encouraging them to devote more time to leisure or home work. In addition, and
more importantly, educated women tend to marry educated men with higher incomes,
so the higher (unearned) family incomes would further discourage women's
participation in the labor market. Combined with a cultural norm that confers higher
status on women at home, other family income can act as a powerful deterrent to
educated women's labor force participation. Where patriarchal norms are less dominant,
the substitution effect should overshadow the income effect (Brinton, Lee, and Parish
1995). But in India, we would expect the income effect to be especially strong.
However, most past studies in India have used National Sample Survey data in
which it is not possible to separate other family members' income from a woman's own
earnings, thus making it difficult to distinguish income and substitution effects. The
present study uses the India Human Development Surveys (IHDS), which measure both
a woman's own earnings and other household income, thus permitting a better
separation of income and substitution effects for educated women. While the results
confirm a strong negative effect of other family income on women's labor force
participation, they again find a U-shaped relationship between women's education and
her labor force participation, even after taking into account other family income. The
other family income controls make the negative sloping part of the curve flatter and the
positively sloping part steeper, but the relationship remains curvilinear rather than
uniformly positive.
A further analysis examines the relationship between women's education and three
different categories of work: salaried positions paid monthly, casual wage work, and
work in family farms or businesses. For salary work, the expected positive linear
relationship is observed: the more education she has, the more likely she is to work in a
salaried position. However, for women employed in their family farms and businesses,
or as wage labor, the relationship is also linear but negative. The observed U-curve is a
resolution of these separate linear relationships.
The negative relationships are likely because more educated women do not want to
work in jobs that do not match their aspirations. The positive relationship with salaried
positions is not sufficient to produce the expected overall positive relationship because
there are not enough salaried positions open to women with moderate levels of
education. The paper concludes by noting the possible importance of occupational sex
segregation in excluding women from clerical and sales jobs that in most countries have
been a major source of employment for moderately educated women.

2. Literature review
While "economic factors largely determine male participation in employment, the
factors that influence a woman's participation in work are varied and include
reproductive, demographic, social, religious and cultural factors" (Srivastava and
Srivastava 2010). Of these, education and family income are especially important
because of their prominent role in labor supply theory.
2.1 Education
Theories of human capital predict that an increase in skills would provide women a
greater opportunity to earn higher wages, and this in turn would increase women's labor
force participation (Smith and Ward 1985; Goldin 1990; England, Garcia-Beaulieu, and
Ross 2004). In most developed countries, increases in education cause an increase in
women's labor force participation (Cain 1966; Tienda, Donato, and Cordero-Guzman
1992; England, Gornick, and Shafer 2012). Interestingly, however, the story is often
quite different in the low and middle-income countries. In Peru, King (1990) reported
that while education was associated with a decline in women's labor force participation,
it did increase the proportion of women in paid employment. On the other hand, in
Ecuador, Jakubson and Psacharopoulos (1992) find that schooling has a positive effect
on women's labor force participation, even though the effect is small. The predicted
probability of labor force participation of a woman with 16 years of schooling (other
traits unchanged) is 11 percentage points higher than for a woman with no schooling.
Reports from South Asia have often highlighted a generally negative relation
between increased levels of education and decreases in women's workforce
participation rate, noting that illiterate women are more likely to be employed than
educated women (Sathar and Desai 2000; Das and Desai 2003). Other studies with
more educational detail (e.g., Reddy 1979) find a J-shaped relationship between
women's education and their labor force participation with increases only at the highest
educational levels. Others (Mathur 1994; Kingdon and Unni 2001; Das 2006) find a U-
shaped relationship with schooling beyond the junior/middle level enhances women's
wage work participation.
Complex socioeconomic phenomena underlie this paradox. Explanations generally
rely on some combination of structural and normative ideas: the disincentives from
other family income, restrictive gender norms (especially those that attribute higher
social status to nonworking women), greater emphasis on domestic duties and child-
rearing in a newly competitive educational system, and the lack of `suitable' work for
Demographic Research: Volume 38, Article 31
http://www.demographic-research.org 859
educated women. But it is difficult to test these explanations empirically with existing
data.
2.2 Other family income
Increases in women's labor force participation as education increases (as predicted by
human capital theory) could be depressed somewhat due to the income effect of other
family income. More educated women are likely to marry more educated men with
higher incomes. If family income is high, women would have less incentive to work
(Goldin 1990; England, Gornick, and Shafer 2012). Abraham (2013) argues that the
rising incomes of Indian households have enabled Indian women to withdraw from the
labor market and focus on their role in `status production.' As with the United States at
the turn of the century, one of the markers of the household having attained a middle-
class status may be to ensure that women from these burgeoning middle classes do not
have to work (Treas 1987). Using unit level data from the National Employment Survey
in urban areas of India, Klasen and Pieters (2015) have confirmed that rising levels of
household income play an important role in declining rates of women's labor force
participation.
2.3 Other factors
It has always been more socially acceptable for women of lower castes (such as
Adivasis, Dalits, and Other Backward Classes) to be in the labor market (Kingdon and
Unni 2001). Women from the higher castes tend to face greater restrictions on their
mobility. However, women from families of the middle and lower castes with improved
social standing also prefer to stay at home as an effort at `Sanskritization' (Srinivas
1966; Chen and Dreze 1995), an attempt to follow a more Brahminical way of life. The
greater the seclusion for the woman, the greater would be the prestige for the family
(Chen 1995).
Caste also has an impact on the educational opportunities women face (Dunn
1993). Thus, part of the higher rates of labor force participation among illiterate women
may be a result of their lower caste status. Similarly, some of the decline in labor force
participation with more education may result from the higher concentrations of higher-
status Forward Castes (such as Brahmins, Kayasthas, Kshatriyas, etc.) among
moderately educated women.
Historical perspectives on women's labor force participation in India note that a
majority of female workers have been involved in agriculture (e.g., Nath 1968).
Chatterjee, Desai & Vanneman: Indian paradox: Rising education, declining women's employment
860 http://www.demographic-research.org
Consequently, women's labor force participation has always been higher for rural then
urban areas. Few women have been employed in the modern sector, where educational
credentials are more important. India is one of the exceptional countries where the
modern sector has experienced a fall in women's work force participation despite
women's rising education (World Bank 1991; Swaminathan 1994).
A slow shift in the industrial structure out of agriculture (Abraham 2013) has been
a leading cause of recent declines in women's labor force participation (Mehrotra and
Perida 2017). Critics of India's Structural Adjustment Program, introduced in 1991,
have argued that these policies also led to a decline in women's employment because of
declines in the unorganized sector (Mundle 1992). Others (e.g., Papola 1994), on the
other hand, proposed that a newly restructured economy could favor the unorganized
sector. where wages were low and working conditions poor, perhaps having a favorable
impact on women's employment. In India, the growth in the female share of
employment in industries and services is behind other South and Southeast Asian
countries (other than Nepal), although declines in female employment have long been
theorized to follow the early stages of development (Boserup 1970). Pampel and
Tanaka (1986) and Mammen and Paxson (2000), for instance, observe the expected U-
shaped relationship between women's labor force participation and GDP per capita. All
of these studies point to the importance of the type of jobs available as a central
moderating influence on the relationship between education and women's labor force
participation.
3. Why IHDS?
The IHDS enjoys several advantages over other surveys for analyzing employment. It
gains a more complete measure of women's labor force participation by reviewing each
household economic activity (own farm work, nonfarm businesses, wage or salaried
labor) and asks which members participate in each activity. This gives a clearer picture
of who is participating in the labor force than does a single question about each
person's principal or secondary activity. Even if a woman's principal and secondary
activities are household work, she could still be engaged in seasonal farm work or
assisting other household enterprises. Another advantage of IHDS is that unlike
previous studies that have information only on total household consumption (which is
endogenous to the woman's own earnings) or husband's and other family members'
wage earnings, IHDS has more complete estimates of other family incomes. Abraham
(2013), for instance, recognizes the theoretical importance of other family income, but
can only use household consumption ("a robust proxy") from the NSS. He finds an
unexpected curvilinear U-shape relationship of women's labor force participation with
Demographic Research: Volume 38, Article 31
http://www.demographic-research.org 861
household consumption levels for urban households, a result that we suspect is driven
by the additional women's income in high consumption households. In the IHDS
measure, the relationship is consistently linear and negative, as theory would predict.
Klasen and Pieters (2015) measure total other household earnings in their NSS
data but try to avoid problems of self-employed incomes by restricting their sample to
urban areas and imputing self-employed earnings based on earnings of similar
employees ("a fairly rough approximation"). The IHDS has a more direct measure of
self-employed incomes and also has several additional measures of unearned income
(e.g., remittances, rents, pensions). According to the two waves of IHDS, about 45% of
households are engaged in own farm work and 20% have at least one nonfarm business
(29% in urban areas). Moreover, 46% of households report some type of unearned
income. Thus, it is difficult to measure the impact of other household income effects if
these income sources are ignored.
4. Hypotheses
The present study uses the IHDS data to test the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: More women's education is associated with a decline in women's
labor force participation rate (LFPR) up to secondary education, with a slight
uptick for postsecondary education.
Hypothesis 1 restates the often-observed relationship between Indian women's
labor force participation and education as U-shaped. The next hypotheses evaluate two
theories that could explain the U-shaped relationship. While Hypothesis 2 evaluates the
`income effect,' Hypothesis 3 examines a labor market hypothesis.
Hypothesis 2a: Higher levels of other family income are associated with a decline
in women's LFPR.
Hypothesis 2b: Women with more education live in households with higher levels
of other family income, and those higher income levels explain the initial declines
in their labor force participation.
As husband's and other family income increases, women's incentive to work
declines. Holding constant other family income should straighten out the U-curve and
reveal the more theoretically conventional positive increases with increasing education.
Chatterjee, Desai & Vanneman: Indian paradox: Rising education, declining women's employment
862 http://www.demographic-research.org
Hypothesis 3a: An increase in education is associated with an increase in women's
employment in salaried jobs.
Hypothesis 3b: An increase in education is associated with a decline in women's
employment in their own family farms and businesses.
Hypothesis 3c: An increase in education is associated with a decline in women's
employment in agricultural and nonagricultural wage work.
It is difficult for women with little education to get high-quality salaried jobs. With
postsecondary school education better quality jobs become more accessible, so the
higher returns to a better-quality job and the increase in social status associated with it
lead to more employment. On the other hand, educated women would not want to work
in outside jobs perceived to be below their educational level, as it lowers their social
status. Therefore, employment in manual labor or even household enterprises would
decline.
Hypotheses 3a to 3c explain the U-shaped relationship only when different types
of work are aggregated together. While on one hand there will be a steady increase in
demand for white-collar jobs among educated women, these jobs would be available
only to women with the highest levels of education. Because there is a limited supply of
such jobs, women with moderate levels of education are left out of the labor market.
5. Data and variables
The present study uses data from the two waves of IHDS (India Human Development
Survey 2016a). IHDS1 is a nationally representative sample of 41,554 households in
2004­2005, spread across all the states and union territories of India (except for the
small territories of Andaman Nicobar and Lakshadweep). The sample covers 384
districts, 1503 villages and 971 urban blocks. These 41,554 households include 215,754
individuals. In 2011­2012 a second wave reinterviewed the same households with an
83% recontact rate. The IHDS2 sample was augmented slightly to adjust for higher
attrition in urban areas. The analysis sample is restricted to married women ages 25­59.
Many women below 25 are still enrolled in an educational institution, and women
above the age of 59 would be likely to retire.
The IHDS is a multitopic survey that encompasses different modules related to
health, education, employment, marriage, gender relations, economic status, social
capital, and other issues. The household economic questionnaire was usually answered
Demographic Research: Volume 38, Article 31
http://www.demographic-research.org 863
by the head of the household or by someone who had sufficient knowledge about the
income, expenditure, and employment status of household members.
Measuring women's employment can be especially challenging because often
women are involved in part-time or seasonal jobs, or they could work from home, or
they may participate in the labor market only in times of a family crisis (Benería 1982;
Folbre 1995; Hirway 2002; Das 2006). As noted above, the IHDS measure of
workforce participation is more detailed than for other surveys. Unlike the NSS, which
asks for a woman's principal and secondary status activities, the IHDS has separate
modules for different types of work (e.g., on the household farm, wage labor, in
household nonfarm businesses) and asks which household members participated in each
type of work during the previous year. In the present study anyone who worked for at
least 240 hours in the previous year across all types of work is considered to be in the
labor force. Caring for household animals, collection of firewood or other fuels, and
fetching water from public sources were not included as labor force participation as
these are usually regarded as normal household chores in India.
In addition to the overall measure of labor force participation, the analysis also
disaggregates work participation into three types: self-employment in own farm and
nonfarm businesses, salaried work (defined as monthly remuneration), and casual
agricultural and nonagricultural wage labor paid daily. For each category of work, if the
woman works for more than 0 hours per year in that type of work and for greater than
240 hours per year in any kind of work, they are considered to be working in that work
category. It should be noted that women can be considered employed in multiple work
categories.
Women's education is divided into six categories: illiterate, preprimary (0­4
years), primary and postprimary (5­9 years), secondary (10­11 years), higher
secondary (12+ years with no degree), and college graduate or higher.
Like employment, personal earnings and household incomes are also aggregate
measures built up across many survey modules. In addition to income and benefits from
each type of work, the survey also asked about household income from remittances,
rental and property income, pensions, and government programs (India Human
Development Survey 2016b). Other family income was calculated for each household
member by subtracting that person's earnings from total family income. For household
enterprises with multiple household workers, each member's own earnings were
calculated as their proportion of total household hours worked multiplied by the net
income from that enterprise. The log of other household income was calculated except
for a small percentage (2.1%) of women with negative or negligible other household
incomes below Rs.1000 (usually households with crop failures resulting in negative net
incomes). A separate dummy variable identified these women, who were then assigned
the floor value of ln(1000) for other household incomes.
Chatterjee, Desai & Vanneman: Indian paradox: Rising education, declining women's employment
864 http://www.demographic-research.org
The analysis also includes controls for years of husband's education (a continuous
variable ranging from 0 to 15); the number of children under six and six to fifteen in the
household; the number of married women in the household; age in five-year categories;
four caste groups (Forward Castes, Other Backward Castes, Scheduled Castes ­ SCs or
Dalits ­ and Scheduled Tribes ­ STs or Adivasis); three religious groups (Hindus,
Muslims, and other minority religions); urban or rural residence; and dummy variables
for state fixed effects.
6. Analysis
6.1 Descriptive statistics
Table 1 gives descriptive statistics of all variables for the sample of 72,620 currently
married women aged 25­59. Of these, 41.6% are employed in some kind of work for at
least 240 hours in the preceding 12 months: 4.8% are employed in salaried work, 26.9%
work in family farms or businesses, and 20.3% in agricultural and nonagricultural wage
work. In the sample, 47.4% of women are illiterate, 26.7% have completed primary
school education, and only 5% are college graduates.

The bivariate relationship between women's LFP and their education is J-shaped,
as has been found in most previous research. Table 2 shows that increases in education
from none to completed secondary school are associated with a steady, steep decline in
women's labor force participation from 53.3% to 22.4%. There is a slight increase in
women's labor force participation thereafter; 28.1% of women who are college
graduates are employed.

866 http://www.demographic-research.org
As expected, a married woman's education is also closely related to her husband's
education and, thus, the income of her family. Column 2 reports the close relationship
between wives' and husbands' education ­ the familiar fact of marriage homogamy.
Partly as a result of this homogamy, column 3 reports the quite linear relationship with
the logarithm of other family income. Each year of a woman's education is associated
with a similar proportional increase of her family's income. For convenience, column 4
translates those annual averages to rupees at 2012 prices. The bivariate association of
other family income with women's labor force participation is also predictably negative
and linear (results not shown). Of women whose families have less than Rs 8000
income, 62.2% are in the labor force; for women in families with over Rs150,000
income, only 21.5% are in the labor force. The research question is whether these other
family income relationships are sufficient to explain the steep decline of women's labor
force participation in column 1. We address that question in the next section.
Finally, columns 5 through 7 show the bivariate relationships of a woman's
education with the three types of employment: salaried work, family enterprises (farm
or nonfarm), and casual wage labor. Each of these is a fairly linear relationship. With
rising education, employment in salaried work increases steadily, falls dramatically for
casual wage labor, and falls more gradually for work in family farms and businesses.
What is important here is that whereas each relationship is quite linear, aggregated
together the relationship becomes the familiar curvilinear J-shape (column 1).
6.2 Logistic regressions of labor force participation
Three logistic regression models predicting the log odds of a woman being employed
are estimated. In the first model, the log odds of a woman being employed are estimated
using only the education categories. The estimated coefficients reflect the J-shape curve
seen in the bivariate relationship of Table 2. The odds decline steadily from illiteracy to
secondary completion and then bend upwards for higher secondary and college
graduates.

The second model adds other family income to the education categories. Not
surprisingly, the estimated effect is quite large: a doubling of other family income (a
little more than half a standard deviation) would reduce the average woman's labor
force participation rate from 41.6% to 33.4%. Our interest, however, is mainly in the
consequences for the education estimates. The estimated decline in the log odds of
employment from illiteracy to completed secondary schooling is reduced from ­1.403
in Model 1 to ­1.038 in Model 2. The estimate is still sharply negative, however;
controlling for the income effect does not transform the education association into the
expected positive linear relationship (i.e., Hypothesis 2b is not supported). A more
noticeable change can be seen for the observed uptick among women with higher
secondary education and college diplomas. The log odds for college graduates being in
the labor force are 0.65 greater than those with secondary education after controls for
other family income as compared to only 0.34 in Model 1.
The third model adds basic control variables: husband's education, wife's age,
number of children under 6 and under 16, number of married women in the household,
religion, caste, area of residence, and dummy variables for state fixed effects. Several of
these relationships are quite strong. Dalits and especially Adivasis are much more likely
to be in the labor force than Forward Castes, even at the same levels of education and
other family income. Because Dalit and Adivasi women are clustered at lower levels of
education, some of the steep negative relationship at lower levels of education is a
consequence of these disadvantaged caste backgrounds, not educational levels.
Similarly, the Forward Caste concentration among college graduates masks some of the
positive effects of higher education on labor force participation. With controls, the
education relationship assumes a clear U-shape so that college graduates are now the
group most likely to be in the labor force, other factors being equal.
The effect of the income and other controls on the education relationship can be
seen more clearly in the predicted probabilities displayed in Figure 1. In comparison to
the bivariate relationship (the heavy line), the graph after controls is more U-shaped.
Though the control for other family income doesn't make the association completely
positive, it does reduce the negatively sloped part of the curve and shows a much
greater increase in the probability of being employed at higher levels of education. The
predicted probability of a woman college graduate being employed after controlling for
other family income and background controls is 0.55 compared to 0.28 in the case
without controls. This gives support to the `income effect,' whereby women belonging
to richer families have higher education but withdraw from the labor force because they
do not have as great a need to work for additional income as compared to women
belonging to poorer families.
Demographic Research: Volume 38, Article 31
http://www.demographic-research.org 869
Figure 1: Predicted probabilities of a married woman aged 25­59 being
employed by education levels
Even though the income effect does explain a part of the paradoxical relationship
between a woman's LFPR and her educational level, it doesn't explain it fully.
Secondary school matriculates are still less likely to be in the labor force than the
uneducated despite their higher human capital that should make employment more
attractive.
Urban residence has a powerful negative effect on women's labor force
participation, but, interestingly, a similar U-shape relationship with education is
observed in both urban and rural areas (results not reported). In both rural and urban
areas, women with completed secondary school have the lowest levels of labor force
participation, which rise with postsecondary education in both rural and urban areas
(slightly stronger in urban areas) and decline from no education in both rural and urban
areas (slightly stronger in rural areas). The strong but mostly additive effect of urban
location suggests that to understand the U-shape curve, it may be necessary to observe
the different kinds of jobs that educated women perform compared to the jobs of
illiterate women.

6.3 Types of work
Table 2 above on the types of jobs held by working women shows that less educated
women more often work on the family farm or as wage laborers; college graduates
more likely are found in the more secure (and prestigious) salaried positions. As a next
step, the study evaluates the role of job types by estimating three multivariate logistic
regression equations to predict the log odds of a woman being employed in each type of
work. Each equation controls for the same variables as Model 3 of Table 3 for overall
work. Table 4 shows the results of the three logistic regressions. Again, calculating
predicted probabilities for each educational level provides a more accessible picture of
the education relationships (see Figure 2).

For salaried positions, more education has the expected positive relationship with a
greater likelihood of work. The predicted probability of a currently married woman
aged 25­59 being employed in a salaried position increases from 0.02 to 0.24 as her
education level increases from being illiterate to being a college graduate. On the other
hand, all other kinds of work show declining probabilities as her education level
increases. The predicted probability of her being employed in a family farm or business
decreases from 0.22 to 0.13; and in agricultural or nonagricultural wage labor from 0.13
to 0.01.
These results are consistent with an explanation of women's labor force
participation that educated women look mainly for better quality jobs, especially
salaried work. The inference might be that if all or most available jobs were salaried,
Indian women would show the usual positive relationship of higher rates of
employment with more education. However, such jobs are limited and are accessible
mainly with higher levels of education. If appropriate jobs were available for women
with intermediate levels of education, we might expect higher levels of their labor force
participation. The answers to the remaining paradoxical U-shape relationship should
best be sought in the demand side of the Indian labor market.
7. Discussion and conclusion
The present study examined the often-observed J-shaped relationship between
education and Indian women's labor force participation. This relationship, especially
the strong decline from illiteracy to secondary completion, is contrary to what would be
predicted by most human capital theory. Secondary school graduates have more skills
and human capital than those with only primary education; and those with completed
primary schooling have some literacy and numeracy compared to those without any
education. These skills should make them more productive workers with higher
earnings and thus more likely to be in the labor force. But the opposite is the case for
Indian women.
The analysis takes advantage of the IHDS as the only national survey in India that
has direct measures of other household income. The results show support for the other
income effect; the greater the income women's households have apart from their own
earnings, the lower the chances of the woman being in the labor force. But other family
incomes hardly explain all of the lower labor force participation of women with
moderate levels of education. Caste and other background factors also explain some of
these differences. But even after taking into account other family income, caste, and
other background characteristics, the relationship between education and women's labor
force participation becomes just U-shaped but not uniformly positive. Although the
Demographic Research: Volume 38, Article 31
http://www.demographic-research.org 873
lower participation rates of secondary school graduates are attenuated after the controls,
they do not disappear. However, after controls, education beyond secondary levels does
lead to a much steeper increase in the predicted probabilities of being a part of the labor
force.
Further analysis points to the kinds of work available and the lack of demand for
moderately educated women's more skilled labor as the main suspect for explaining the
declining segment of the U-curve. For salaried work, the probability of being employed
steadily increases as a woman's education increases, whereas for casual wage labor and
for work in family farms and businesses, women's LFPR decreases with an increase in
education. Once they attain moderate levels of education, women do not work in
manual labor. The decline in women's LFPR with more education is greatest for
agricultural and nonagricultural wage work, even more than for work in family
enterprises. It is especially manual work outside the household that is perceived to be
below one's educational attainment. The preference for salaried jobs as women attain
moderate education could reverse the downward part of the U-curve, but such jobs are
limited for women.
The lack of demand in India, despite economic growth, has been noted by other
researchers (Klasen and Pieters 2015). But why economic growth has not generated
these jobs remains mostly an unanswered question. One place to look for answers that
has not been sufficiently appreciated would be the high levels of occupational
segregation. In India, as everywhere, a major employer of moderately educated workers
is white-collar employment in clerical and sales jobs. But in India, these jobs are still
reserved for men. The 2001 census reports that 87.3% of office clerks and 93.1% of
sales jobs are held by men (Census 2001). It is not so much the lack of adequate jobs
for moderate levels of education but the exclusion of women from these jobs that
explains the low rates of labor force participation for these women.
In contrast, skilled work in education and health sectors is not nearly so gender
segregated, perhaps in part because this type of work conforms better with gender
stereotypes of women's nurturing roles. But much of this work requires education
beyond secondary school, so the weaker sex segregation in these jobs results in a
greater demand for educated female labor and the observed rise in labor force
participation among female graduates. Over three-quarters of teachers, for instance,
have education above secondary level, and over one-third, 36.8%, are women.
Much of the recent work on Indian women's labor force participation has focused
on the important issue of declining rates over recent years. The U-shaped relationship
between education and women's labor participation receives notice in these studies and
is recognized as one of the causes of the declining rates. Women's increasing levels of
education in recent years has put a larger share of women in the lowest portion of the
U-curve (Andres et al. 2017). But the U-curve itself has received surprisingly little
Chatterjee, Desai & Vanneman: Indian paradox: Rising education, declining women's employment
874 http://www.demographic-research.org
research attention. The observed difference between illiterate women and women with
some secondary education in fact exceeds the over time decline, but has not inspired the
same level of research attention. This lack of interest is all the more surprising given its
discrepancy with most labor supply theory. Explanations in the literature often cite
restrictive gender norms or the lack of `suitable' work for educated women, but a lack
of adequate data means that these explanations usually go untested. And the role of
occupational segregation and the possibility of discrimination and exclusion of women
from white-collar work is almost absent from this literature.
The IHDS results do show that an adequate measure of other family income does
explain some of the paradoxical decline in women's labor force participation with more
education. But the U-curve remains, so we need a renewed focus on explaining why
these additional levels of human capital are not brought into the labor market. Much of
labor supply theory derives from high-income countries' (especially the United States')
experience; the Indian results offer an opportunity to expand that limited background.
