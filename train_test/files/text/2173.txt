Purpose: Given the paucity of research on the
role of geography in mental health care, this study
examined whether racial differences in mental health
service use varied across geographic regions among
older adults. Design and Methods: Drawn
from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology
Surveys (CPES), blacks (n = 1,008) and whites
(n = 1,870) aged 60 and older were selected for
analysis. Logistic regression analyses were con-
ducted. Results: Results showed significant
racial disparities in mental health service use in the
overall sample, as well as significant variation by
region. Although no racial differences were observed
in the Northeast, West, or Midwest regions, black
elders in the South were significantly less likely than
whites to use mental health services (odds ratios
[OR], 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34­
3.23). Implications: The findings suggest that
improving the access to mental health care in certain
regions, the South in particular, may be essential to
reduce racial disparities at the national level. Policy
implications are discussed.

This study addressed the national priority of
reducing or eliminating disparities in health and
health care between racial/ethnic minority and
nonminority older adults. Despite inconsistent
findings on racial/ethnic differences in mental health
problems (Barrio et al., 2008; Miranda et al., 2008;
Vega & Lopez, 2001; Williams & Earl, 2007),
racial and ethnic minorities--especially blacks and
Latinos--continue to utilize mental health services
at only half the rate of non-Hispanic whites, even
after accounting for their mental health status
(AHRQ, 2010; Alegría et al., 2002; Cooper-Patrick
et al., 1999; Dobalian & Rivers, 2008; Neighbors
et al., 2007; Snowden, 1999, 2001; U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, 2001; Wang et al.,
2005). It is especially alarming in the field of
gerontology that older adults in general are less
likely to use mental health services than younger
adults (Mackenzie, Pagura, & Sareen, 2010).
Studies investigating factors associated with use
of mental health services often rely on Andersen's
(1968, 1995) behavioral model of health service
utilization, a theoretical framework employed in
the present study. Many studies have focused on
individual-level factors to explain mental health

tus), enabling (income, poverty, and educational
attainment), and need factors (physical and men-
tal health need and perceived health status; Crabb
& Hunsley, 2006; Kim, Jang, Chiriboga, Ma,
& Schonfeld, 2010; Kim et al., 2011; McAlpine
& Mechanic, 2000; Segal, Coolidge, Mincic, &
O'Riley, 2005; Sentell et al., 2007; White-Means,
2000). However, Andersen's model implic-
itly emphasizes the importance of geographic
(area-level) factors that affect service use in addi-
tion to the individual-level factors.
An emerging body of literature suggests that geog-
raphy influences mental health (Curtis, 2004; Joe,
Baser, Breeden, Neighbors, & Jackson, 2006; Philo,
2005). For example, Philo (2005) suggested that
geographic areas that have stressful environments
are associated with mental illness. Curtis (2004)
also noted in her study conducted in urban areas in
the United Kingdom that mental health problems in
certain areas are exacerbated by geographic char-
acteristics such as "physical and biological risks,
material deprivation, and social fragmentation or
anomie." Joe and colleagues (2006) reported that
blacks in the Midwest had a significantly higher risk
for suicidal attempt than those in the South. This
line of research underscores that geographical con-
text is crucial in understanding variations in mental
health and access to mental health care.
Despite its importance, little is known about the
role of geography in racial and ethnic disparities in
mental health care. There are, however, some recent
studies on geographic differences in physical health
care relating to racial/ethnic disparities. Baicker,
Chandra, and Skinvner (2005) demonstrated the con-
tribution of geography to black­white disparities in
health care by exploring care for diabetic Medicare
beneficiaries in 306 hospital referral regions of the
United States.The authors found that areas with large
racial disparities in monitoring of hemoglobin A1c
often had overall rates of monitoring that were higher
than average and, conversely, that areas with small
disparities had lower-than-average overall rates. This
implies that to reduce disparities at the national level,
improving the overall quality of care in low-quality
regions may be more effective than attempting to
achieve equal rates of care across racial/ethnic groups
within regions.Semrad,Tancredi,Baldwin,and Green
(2011) also documented racial/ethnic disparities in
colorectal cancer screening across geographic regions.
These studies consistently emphasize the importance
of considering geography when racial and ethnic dis-
parities are examined.
To our knowledge, there is no published research
on geographic variations in mental health service
use among racially/ethnically diverse older adults.
Therefore,thepresentstudyexaminedwhetherracial
differences in mental health service use among older
adults varied across geographic regions. Specifically,
we examined the use of mental health services as a
function of geographic region in a national sample
of black and white elders. Given the lack of previ-
ous research on this topic in the United States and
the exploratory nature of the present analyses, we
did not present specific hypotheses regarding which
geographic regions might differ.
Methods
Sample
The present study was based on nationally
representative samples from the Collaborative
Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES, 2001­
2003). Funded by the National Institute of Mental
Health (NIMH), the CPES consists of three national
surveys: (a) the National Comorbidity Survey
Replication (NCS-R), (b) the National Survey of
American Life (NSAL), and (c) the National Latino
and Asian American Study (NLAAS). Face-to-face
interviews were conducted unless the respondent
specifically requested a telephone interview or if a
face-to-face interview was not feasible. The CPES
provides a unique opportunity to understand mental
health disparities because it is the first nationally
representative data set with sufficient power to
allow investigation of cultural influences on mental
disorders and utilization of mental health care, with
special emphasis on racial/ethnic minority groups.
The CPES sample frame was based on a four-stage
national area probability sample conducted in a
total of 252 geographic areas or primary sampling
units (PSUs) across the United States. More detailed
informationonsamplingdesignisavailableelsewhere
(Heeringa et al., 2004; Pennell et al., 2004).
For the present study, we selected adults aged 60
and older who are blacks (n = 1,008) and non-His-
panic whites (n = 1,870).As displayed in Table 1, our
sample represents 4 regions, 38 states, and 216 coun-
ties. Thirteen states were not sampled. The South has
the largest number of study participants as well as the
highest percentage of counties represented (46.8%).
Our use of the general data set along with the unique
geographicidentifiers(FederalInformationProcessing
Standard [FIPS] codes) included in a restricted data
set has been approved by the Institutional Review
Board (IRB) at the University of Alabama.

Measures
Mental Health Service Use.--The CPES assessed
use of the following mental health services to repre-
sent three service sectors: (a) specialty mental health
sector (psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, and
social workers seen in mental health settings, other
mental health professionals, and mental health hot-
lines), (b) general medical sector (general practition-
ers, family doctors, nurses, occupational therapists,
and other health professionals seen for mental health
problems), and (c) any other service sector (religious
or spiritual advisors, counselors, social workers seen
in nonmedical settings, or any alternative services).
Respondents were asked to report whether or not
they used these services during the past 12 months.
Their answers were dichotomized to indicate
whether they had used any mental health services
listed earlier (coded as 1) or not (coded as 0).
Geographic Areas.--The CPES provides
county-level FIPS codes, which are unique geo-
graphic identifiers, that can provide geographi-
cal units (e.g., states and counties) in the United
States, where each participant may reside. Using
these FIPS codes, we were able to classify individu-
als living in four main regions of the United States
(Midwest, Northeast, South, and West) as defined
by the U.S. Census Bureau. Although state-level
analyses were conducted for descriptive purposes
in the present study, county-level analyses were not
conducted due to the small sample sizes of older
blacks and whites in many counties.
Covariates.--Participants' background charac-
teristics were employed as covariates. The variables
includedintheanalyseswereage(years),sex(women/
men),marital status (married or cohabiting/divorced,
separated, widowed, or never married), educational
attainment (0­11 years/ 12 years/13­15 years/16 or
more years), annual household income (less than
$20K/$20K­$34K/$35K­$74K/$75K, or more),
and diagnosis of any Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) psychiat-
ric disorder in the past year (yes/no).
Data Analysis
Pearson's chi-square tests of proportional differ-
ences and independent sample t tests were used to
describe sample characteristics and the use of men-
tal health services and to note statistical differences
between blacks and non-Hispanic whites. In order
to examine the likelihood of using mental health
services, logistic regression analyses were con-
ducted for the entire United States and stratified
by region after adjusting for covariates. The pro-
posed model included all covariates and did not
use an incremental approach. This approach was
chosen due to the relevance of all covariates in the
study and there was no violation of Hosmer and
Lemeshow's goodness of fit. The logistic regres-
sion procedure for the entire United States was

Results
Background Characteristics of the Sample
Table 2 summarizes sample characteristics by
race. In concordance with the racial profile of the
United States (U.S.Census Bureau,2001),the South
shows the highest percentage of blacks followed by
the Northeast. The proportion of blacks residing
in the South (49.7%) and Northeast (26.3%) was
significantly higher than that of whites residing in
these regions (34.2% and 18.3%, respectively),
although both regions have a white majority.
Socioeconomic variables indicated significant
racial differences with blacks both being less edu-
cated and having lower levels of income. No racial
difference was found for DSM-IV diagnosis. In
addition, no significant regional differences were
found in the prevalence of DSM-IV diagnosis (²
= 1.71, df = 3, p = .635; not presented in tables).
Mental Health Service Use for All United States
and by Background Characteristics
Table 3 displays mental health service use bro-
ken down by background characteristics. Of the
2,878 participants, 17.4% reported having used
mental health services. Region was significantly
related to service use, such that individuals in the
Northeast and South reported lower mental health
service use than did those in the Midwest and West.
Race was significantly related to service use, such
that blacks' utilization rate was 6.4% lower than
the rate for whites.
All covariates except marital status were
significantly related to mental health service use.
Those who used services tended to be younger
and more educated, and to have greater income.
Women were more likely to report using services
than men.Those who reported having any DSM-IV

Logistic Regression of Mental Health Service
Use for Entire United States and by Region
Table 4 summarizes the probability of using
mental health services as a function of geographic
region. Results from logistic regression analy-
ses without controlling for covariates show sig-
nificant racial and regional differences in mental
health service use: older adults who are white
(odds ratios [OR], 1.49; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.20­1.86) and who reside in the Midwest
(OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.18­2.09) and the West (OR,
1.35; 95% CI, 1.05­1.73) were more likely to use
mental health services than those who are black
and reside in the South (not presented in tables).
After controlling for all covariates, no regional dif-
ferences were found in mental health service use
in the entire United States. Compared with our
finding on significant regional differences from
descriptive statistics and logistic regression analy-
ses without covariates, this finding may be related
to the differential effects of certain covariates
such as sex, education, income, and psychiatric
disorders across regions controlled in multivari-
ate analyses. However, racial differences persisted
with whites being almost twice more likely to use
mental health service than blacks.
Among covariates, women were more than 2.5
times more likely to use services than men.Of the soci-
oeconomic status variables (education and income),
only education was found to be a significant predictor
of mental health service use, with participants with
16 or more years of education being more than twice

a high school education. Again, having any DSM-IV
psychiatric disorder within the last 12 months was the
strongest predictor of using mental health services in
the overall sample.
When examining disparities within each region,
significant racial differences were found only in the
South, with the odds of whites' using mental health
services being 2.08 times greater than that of blacks.

covariates, older adults residing in the South showed
more disparities in using mental health services than
the other regions. There were sex differences in both
the South and the West, with women more likely to
use services than men. Educational differences existed
in the Northeast and the South with those having
the highest levels of education utilizing service more
than those in the lowest category. The West was
the only region to show income as a predictor of
mental health service use; the odds of using mental
health services for those with greater than or equal to
$75,000 annual income were 2.59 times greater than
those for individuals with less than $20,000 annual
income. Having any DSM-IV psychiatric disorders in
the past 12 months was predictive across all regions,
with those having disorders being more likely to use
mental health services.
Southern states included in the present study
were analyzed to explore the states that specifi-
cally contribute to black­white disparities at the
national level. Among 15 southern states included
in the study, we were able to conduct additional
analyses for four states having at least five par-
ticipants in each cell (black vs white/yes vs no on
service use in the past year) of the state-level con-
tingency table. All four states (Florida, Georgia,
Texas, and Virginia) consistently showed lower uti-
lization rates among older blacks compared with
their white counterparts. The black­white gaps
in utilization rates were most apparent in Florida
(9.27%) and least apparent in Georgia (1.36%).
Discussion
Racial differences in mental health service use
differ substantially by region. To our knowledge,
this is the first study reporting the interactive role
of race and geography in mental health service use
among older adults. Using a nationally representa-
tive sample, we found clear evidence that black­
white disparities in mental health service use at the
national level were largely due to racial disparities
in the South. Older whites in the South were much
more likely to use mental health services than their
black counterparts, but there were no significant
racial differences in the rest of the country. The
findings suggest that to reduce black­white gaps
in mental health service use at the national level,
special attention should be paid to improve access
to mental health care in the South.
Potential reasons for the black­white disparities
in mental health service use in the South deserve
further discussion. Regional differences in race
and culture may influence attitudes toward men-
tal health service use. Previous research suggests
that culture is an important predictor of receiving
preventive care among racial and ethnic minori-
ties (Goel et al., 2003; Kandula, Wen, Jacobs, &
Lauderdale, 2006). Thus, older blacks and whites
may have different attitudes toward mental health
service use, which may in turn affect willingness to
seek professional help for mental health problems.
Distrust and poor information regarding general
health care procedures (Ibrahim, Siminoff, Burant,
& Kwoh, 2002) may contribute to racial disparities
in mental health care. Regional variations of racial
disparities across the United States may also reflect
problems with access to mental health care and
limits on the availability of mental health services
in communities with large proportions of blacks.
Our additional analyses on the four southern
states (Florida, Georgia, Texas, and Virginia) con-
sistently showed lower utilization rates among
older blacks compared with their white counter-
parts. This clearly suggests that we need to inves-
tigate local- or area-level barriers that impair
mental health service utilization rates among older
blacks in the South more so than in other areas.
It should be also noted that we were not able to
test these potential causal factors in the present
study because CPES did not measure such vari-
ables. Future research should elucidate reasons for
the lower mental health service use among older
blacks in the South.
The present study has policy implications. In
order to reduce racial disparities in the mental
health service use across the United States, policy
interventions targeting certain geographic areas are
needed. Given that racial/ethnic minorities live dis-
proportionately in areas with low quality of care
(Baicker et al., 2005), racial disparities in mental
624 The Gerontologist
health service use across the United States could
be reduced by addressing the problem of regional
variations in the utilization of services. Therefore,
policymakers should target reducing disparities in
mental health care arising from geographic areas,
which may in turn improve mental health care
received by all U.S. older adults and by minor-
ity older adults in particular. Further research is
required to provide more information about how
geographic and regional factors relate to disparities
in mental health service use. More detailed analyses
at the county or local level would be desirable to
support development of policy interventions.
Some limitations should be noted. First, the
lowest level of geography analyzed was the state.
Although the CPES provides county-level FIPS
codes, sample sizes for older blacks and whites
in some areas were not adequate for meaningful
comparisons. Second, subgroup differences among
older blacks were not examined in the present
analysis. Previous research suggests the importance
of examining subgroups in health disparities
research, reporting evidence of cultural differences
between Caribbean blacks and African Americans
in the United States (Joe et al., 2006). Future
research should consider examining potential
subgroup differences. Third, other racial/ethnic
groups were not considered in the present study.
Future research should examine how geography
influences mental health service use in other racial/
ethnic groups, such as Latinos/Hispanics and
Asians. Fourth, future studies might benefit from
analyzing larger numbers of individuals who have
DSM-IV diagnoses to allow sufficient statistical
power to examine how his might relate to mental
health disparities. Our logistic regression model
suggested that use of mental health services by
those with DSM-IV diagnoses might be affected
by different factors compared with those without
diagnoses. However, given that the sample is
small (n = 134), we did not have enough power to
detect an association if one exists. Fifth, although
the CPES is a nationally representative data, 13
states were not included in our analyzed sample.
Finally, the present study did not control for the
effects of other important covariates such as
religiosity, cultural factors, and local area­level
characteristics (e.g., availability of mental health
services such as mental health specialists and
community mental health centers, rural vs urban
differences, percentage of insured populations) that
might affect service utilization for mental health
problems. A related limitation is that the present
study did not include any variables on regional
structure of African American and non-Hispanic
whites in the United States, for example, more than
50% of all African Americans in the United States
resided in the South region in the 2000 census (the
closest one to the data used in the present study;
U.S. Census Bureau, 2001). Future research should
examine whether these factors are responsible for
observed regional differences.
In sum, we found clear evidence that regional
variations in mental health service use among
older blacks contribute to the black­white dis-
parities in service use at the national level. Future
research should examine local and regional bar-
riers that affect mental health service use among
older blacks in geographic areas where greater dis-
parities exist. Given that racial disparities existed
only in the South across the four regions in the
United States, future research should focus on the
southern states to conduct more detailed analyses
at the state-level to elucidate potential reasons for
disparities.
