Introduction
Preschool education in Turkey has been improved by the
recent initiatives of governmental and nongovernmental orga-
nizations. The general aim of these initiatives was to increase
the nation's young children's enrolment rates in preschool as
much as possible. The national education statistics of formal
education for the education period of 2013-2014 published by
the Turkish Republic Ministry of National Education (MoNE;
2014) revealed that the 27.71% of children between 3 and 5
years, 37.46% of children between 4 and 5 years, and 42.54%
ofchildren5yearsoldreceivedpreschooleducation.Following
the initiatives to improve preschool education, in the educa-
tion year of 2006-2007, the Council of Higher Education
(CoHE; 2007) revised the national teacher education curricula
to increase the quality of teacher education in Turkey's univer-
sities. Although the preschool education undergraduate pro-
gram in use was revised in 2006, there is still a need for another
revision since the Turkish education system was reshaped in
2012 and the preschool age range was specified from 37
months to 66 months (MoNE, 2012b). Students graduating
from Turkish preschool teacher education programs are
granted their preschool/kindergarten teaching license, and are
entitled to teach in public and private preschools and kinder-
garten classes.
MoNE (2011) defines professional qualities for preschool
teachers in seven major areas: child development, communi-
cating with families and involving families of young children,
assessment, communication skills, creativity/aesthetic, col-
laboration with school and community, and professional
development. Although the professional qualities in early
childhood and preschool education vary from country to
country, those cited by the MoNE (2011) are common and
universal areas for high-quality early childhood teaching
(e.g., Center for the Study of Child Care Employment
[CSCCE], 2008; European Commission, Directorate-General
for Education and Culture [EC, DGEC], 2011). However,

A Program Review: Turkish Early
Childhood Education Preservice Teachers'
Perceptions About Teacher and Teaching
Jale Aldemir1 and Gökçe Kurt2
Abstract
The purpose of this study was to discover the transformation preschool teacher candidates go through in their perceptions
about teacher and teaching during their teacher education program. The participants of the study were 35 senior students
enrolled in the preschool teacher education program at a university located in the Eastern Anatolian Region of Turkey. A
qualitative survey instrument was conducted to examine the preservice teachers' perceptions. The data collected from the
survey were analyzed by adopting a constant comparative coding method. The study revealed a change in the participants'
perceptions about preschool education before and after they enrolled in the program. The hardest parts of teaching in
preschool were the need of high level of energy, patience, and skills to manage the classroom while the most pleasurable
sides were having fun, play opportunities, and the positive impact teachers make on children. The qualities of an ideal
preschool program listed by the participants involved curriculum, physical environment, and social-emotional atmosphere
while the themes regarding the ideal preschool teacher were revolved around the personal qualities, professional attitude,
and professional knowledge and skills. Hence, the findings of this qualitative study can only be generalized in the context the
study was conducted; however, the study could have important implications for preschool teacher education in Turkey and
in other countries, and help the international readers perceive preschool teacher education from a different perspective.

city of Turkey brings the challenge of qualitative and quanti-
tative shortage of human resources, and environmental facili-
ties in turn lower the quality of teachers trained by the same
institutions (Mother Child Education Foundation [MCEF],
2007). Therefore, preschool teacher education programs must
review their program outcomes through different means and
resources to improve the quality of the preschool teacher edu-
cation in Turkey.
Problem of Research
It has been widely acknowledged that the process of pre-
service training greatly influences the formation of novice
teachers' professional identities (Early et al., 2007;
Fukkink & Lont, 2007). Richardson (2005) emphasizes the
quality of the experience with formal knowledge during
the professional training as a factor affecting teachers' per-
ceptions about teaching. Black and Halliwell (2000), how-
ever, accentuate the importance of teachers' past
experiences in shaping their teacher image. The research-
ers indicate that documenting and reflecting on individu-
als' past educational experiences could help them discern
their images about teaching. Similarly, Joram and Gabriele
(1998) point to that teacher candidates use their previously
constructed ideas and perceptions to interpret the theoreti-
cal and practical information they gain throughout their
teacher education programs. While the research literature
on perceptions about teacher and teaching mostly focus on
elementary and upper level, little known is preschool pre-
service teachers' perceptions about teacher and teaching,
and how those perceptions affect formation of their profes-
sional qualities.
Research Focus
As teacher educators, the authors of this article believe that it
is imperative to discover the kinds of transformation pre-
school teacher candidates go through in their perceptions
about teacher and teaching during their teacher education
programs so that the preschool teacher education programs
review and revise their approach to training Turkey's grow-
ing preschool teacher workforce.
Method
General Background of Research
In the present study, the authors worked with the senior stu-
dents of the preschool education program at an Eastern
Anatolian University to answer the following research
questions:
Research Question 1 (RQ1): What are the demographic
characteristics and previous experiences of the students in
the field of preschool education?
Research Question 2 (RQ2): Why the students chose
preschool teaching as a profession?
Research Question 3 (RQ3): What were the most bene-
ficial courses for the students?
Research Question 4 (RQ4): What were the most influ-
ential theories for the students?
Research Question 5 (RQ5): What were the changes in
the students' thoughts about preschool education before
and after the program?
Research Question 6 (RQ6): What were the hardest and
pleasurable sides of teaching young children?
Research Question 7 (RQ7): What are the qualities of
their ideal preschool teacher?
Research Question 8 (RQ8): What are the students' per-
ceptions of a preschool teacher's qualities?
Research Question 9 (RQ9): What are the students'con-
cerns about teaching in the future?
Participants
Out of 45 senior students enrolled in the preschool education
program at an Eastern Anatolian University, 35 students
agreed to participate in the study.
Instrument and Procedures
In this study, the authors used a qualitative approach to
investigate preschool preservice teachers' perceptions about
teaching and teacher in the context of Turkish culture. The
authors used a survey instrument, which was used in another
study to investigate the perceptions of a culturally and lin-
guistically different group of early childhood preservice
teachers (Aldemir, 2007). The instrument was independently
translated from English to Turkish by the authors of the
study. The authors consulted each other on each item of the
instrument. Later, the Turkish version of the survey was sent
to three different university professors at the preschool
teacher education programs in Turkey to get more insights
about whether the instrument items were conveyed the
intended meanings in Turkish Language. Upon feedback, the
revisions were made on the instrument. Both authors were
Turkish and studied their master's and doctoral degrees in
the United States; therefore, they were capable of translating
documents from English to Turkish and from Turkish to
English.
Using survey method as a qualitative means to collect
data works differently than using the same method in quanti-
tative studies. Jansen (2010) defines qualitative survey
method as follows:
The qualitative type of survey does not aim at establishing
frequencies, means or other parameters but at determining the
diversity of some topic of interest within a given population.
This type of survey does not count the number of people with
the same characteristic (value of variable) but it establishes the
Aldemir and Kurt 3
meaningful variation (relevant dimensions and values) within
that population. (p. 3)
The qualitative survey instrument utilized in this study
was prepared according to predetermined categories as
Jansen (2010) suggests. This approach is called "deductive"
or "predetermined" survey method. Such instrument allows
the researcher to observe the selected population from a
more refined eye to study the values reflected by the popula-
tion as they relate to those predetermined categories. In the
present study, the authors formed the questions in the instru-
ment in three sections: (a) demographic information (e.g.,
gender, age, academic- and job-related experiences, pre-
school experience as a child, and reasons to choose preschool
education as a major), (b) program experience (e.g., courses
taken, theories learned, favorite courses and theories, and
before and after thoughts in the program about preschool
education), and (c) perceptions (e.g., qualities of preschool
and preschool teacher, and concerns about future teaching).
Sections 2 and 3 included open-ended questions.
The surveys were applied to the students in the academic
year of 2009-2010 in the context of Parent Education course
at the appropriate class times. Some students preferred to
complete the surveys at their convenient times and e-mailed
them back to the instructor. The instructor was the second
author of the article and already had a well-developed rap-
port with the students. The researchers were eager to conduct
such a study to gain information about the students' feed-
backs on the experiences during their educational journey.
The participants were in their last year of preschool educa-
tion undergrad program and they were equally eager to fill
out the surveys and share their experiences. The students also
stated that the results of this study were important and need
be taken into consideration by the professionals and lawmak-
ers in the preschool education field.
Data Analysis
The data collected from the open-ended questions of the sur-
vey were analyzed by adopting a constant comparative cod-
ing method (Glaser & Strauss, 1999). Coding a set of
qualitative data helps the researcher define the similar occur-
rences throughout different cases and thereby make mean-
ingful interpretations (Charmaz, 2005). Through constant
comparative coding method, initially each piece of data was
analyzed and compared with the previous incidents that have
already been analyzed. This process helped the authors refine
the predetermined categories and their properties.As the data
analysis progressed, the authors compared each new piece of
data with the categories previously formed. The NVIVO 7
qualitative data analysis software was utilized in categoriza-
tion of the data. The software was useful in saving time that
could be lost with hand-coding.
The credibility of the survey instrument was assured
through back translation method and feedbacks from the
experts in the field as mentioned in the research instrument
section. Furthermore, the integrity of data analysis was main-
tained through the investigator triangulation. The researchers
cross checked the credibility of their interpretations of the
meanings in the participants' responses to the survey. The
second author was the gatekeeper for this research since she
had a well-developed rapport with her students and was
familiar with the research site culture. Thus, she was able to
provide better insight about the meanings the students con-
veyed through the survey instrument. In addition, the
"Findings" section include rich, thick descriptions of the par-
ticipants' answers (Whittemore, Chase, & Mandle, 2001).
Findings
The findings of the study are presented in three sections:
"Demographic Information," "Program Experience," and
"Perceptions." Below, the relevant research questions are
presented for each finding.
Demographic Information
RQ1: What are the demographic characteristics and previous
experiences of the students in the field of preschool educa-
tion? Thirty-five senior preschool preservice teachers, 29
females and 6 males, participated in the study. The ages of
the participants ranged from 21 to 25, except 3 students who
were in the 26-to-29-year age range. Of the 35 participants,
only 5 attended a kindergarten program before their enrol-
ment in first grade, and 2 participants received center-based
child care as a child. Although the majority of the partici-
pants were from the working-class households, they did not
work to support their education expenses at the time the
study was conducted. Only 2 participants were full-time
employees in the state agencies. Two other participants were
volunteers at rehabilitation centers for children with special
needs. Eight participants mentioned practica/field experi-
ence courses as the only source of experience in which they
had gained insight into working with young children.
RQ2:Why did the students choose preschool teaching as a pro-
fession? The participants were asked to state why they chose
preschool education as their future profession. Table 1 dis-
plays the responses provided by the participants, explaining
why they chose preschool teaching as a profession and rat-
ings for each reason.
The analysis showed that the first reason to choose pre-
school teaching as a career was love for children. This find-
ing echoed the findings from previous studies (Gürbüztürk &
Genç, 2004; Özbek, 2007) that the Turkish preservice teach-
ers chose the teaching profession as a career path because of
the personal reasons such as that teaching is a respected pro-
fession or love for children. The second reason to choose
preschool teaching was the job guarantee. The graduates of
teacher education programs in Turkey are mostly employed
4 SAGE Open
by the state public schools (Yüksel, 2012), which provide
them with job security, benefits, and a standard living level.
The third reason to choose preschool teaching was the par-
ticipants' scores in the Student Selection and Placement
Examination. The higher education institutions in Turkey are
centralized under the CoHE. Acceptance to undergraduate
programs of the universities, either state or private, is cen-
tralized by the Student Selection and Placement Centre
(SSPC). Enrolment to an undergraduate program requires a
composite score of the central exams and high-school grade
point average (CoHE, 2010). Because the scoring system
determines the type of program a student would be enrolled
in (World Bank, 2007), some participants in this study chose
the preschool teaching profession because their composite
score matched with the preschool education program
entrance score.
Program Experience
RQ3: What were the most beneficial courses for the stu-
dents? The first section of the open-ended questions in the
survey intended to explore the participants' program experi-
ence. One student did not respond to this question. Table 2
shows the courses with their listing rates.
RQ4: What were the most influential theories for the stu-
dents? The students were asked to list the theories that they
thought were the most influential in their teaching philoso-
phy and to explain the effects of those theories in their teach-
ing philosophy. Two students did not respond to this question.
Many of the participants listed more than one theory and
explained the effects of those theories in their teaching
philosophy.
Erik Erikson's psycho-social theory was listed in the
30.30% of the responses. One of the participants stated that
she felt much closer to Erikson's theory about child develop-
ment "because his theory explains how social environment
can impact children's development." Piaget's cognitive
learning theory was the second most popular theory with a
rating of 27.27%. A student explained that,
learning comes from inside of a child and that it is an active
exploration process. Therefore, instead of trying to load the
information to the child, a teacher must prepare materials that
interest children and help them solve problems by themselves.
A total of 18.18% of the students chose not to mention
any specific theory but stated that they were eclectic in
applying theories of child development in their teaching.
One student stated that she valued all the theories and she
would like to apply them according to children's different
needs. Howard Gardner's multiple intelligences theory
received attention from the 15.15% of the participants. A
participant stated, "I feel closer to his ideas about learning.
When I plan and implement activities, I consider individ-
ual variations and do not expect the same performance
from all the students." As popular as Gardner's theory was
Carl Roger's humanistic theory. One of the participant
stated that each person had a potential for self-actualiza-
tion when appropriate conditions were provided. Albert
Bandura's social learning theory captured the attention of
12.12% in the responses. One of the students indicated, "I
think a child learns from his family and close surrounding.

Because of this, I find Bandura's theory closer to my
views." Vygotsky's social development theory was listed
in the 9.09% of the responses. A participant stated, "I find
Vygotsky's development theory closer to my views.
Because children gain information by constructing it.
Development cannot be separated from the social context.
Learning helps development. Language plays a fundamen-
tal role in the development of mind." Finally, 9.09% of the
participants mentioned that they found Freud's Stages of
Psychosexual Development closer to their views. One of
the students wrote, "I find Freud's Stages of Development
true. Personality development occurs 0 to 6 years old
period."
Perceptions
RQ5: What were the changes in the students' thoughts about
preschool education before and after the program? The partici-
pants were asked to state the change in their thoughts about
preschool education before their entrance to the program and
after their education in the program. All the participants stated
a change in their perceptions about preschool education
before and after. The dichotomy between before and after
thoughts was drastic in the participants' perceptions about
preschool education. Seven change areas emerged from the
students' responses. The themes were put in Table 3 with cor-
responding statement examples from the participants.
Table 3. Changes in the Participants' Thoughts About Preschool Education.
Themes Before After
Necessity of preschool
education
"I used to think that preschool education
was not a big deal."
"Now I believe preschool education is a
must."
 "I used to think preschool education was
unnecessary."
"Now I know it is necessary for the child's
development, creativity, unfolding hidden
talents, and school readiness."
 "I did not know how much preschool
education benefits children. I also used
to think preschool teaching as a very
comfortable and easy teaching job."
"Now I believe that preschool education is a
must and preschool teaching requires hard
work."
Behavior management "I used to think that strict disciplining and
punishment were the most effective ways."
"Now I believe that alternative methods are
more effective."
 "I did not know how wrong it is to say `no,
don't do that' to a child every time."
"Now I know education must start early
or it could be too late." "Now I became
more patient. I can get down to their level
and communicate with them."
 "I used to be very impatient toward
children."
"Now I know that children do not learn
because of lack of rules. They can become
cooperative with a good behavior
management plan."
 "I used to think that children cannot think
learn, are stubborn and naughty."

Curriculum in preschool
education
"I used to think that children's songs did
not have any effect on children's language
development."
"Now I believe that songs help improve
language skills in children."
 "I used to think music, art, and play were
activities to entertain children." "I used to
think learning though play ineffective."
"Now I know those activities (music, art,
and play) are very important in children's
development."
 "Now I know how much learning through
play is effective."
Characteristics of development
in early childhood period.
"I never thought that children are egocentric,
animistic, and use their senses."
"During my education, I learned a great deal
about children and feel as if I am more
knowledgeable."
Children's level of
comprehension
"I used to think that children are not able to
understand issues as adults do."
"Now I think when we explain issues to
them they can understand and can help
us."
Theories of child development "I did not know the importance of theories." "Now I know how important they are."
Field experience in preschool
teacher education
"I used to think that theories were more
helpful in teaching."
"Now I know practicum experience is more
important."
6 SAGE Open
Mainly three themes surfaced as more important among
nine: "Necessity of preschool education, behavior manage-
ment, and curriculum in preschool education." The partici-
pants transformed their ideas about the necessity of preschool
education. Some of them used to believe that the education in
this period of life was not very important. After their educa-
tion in the program, they became advocates of preschool
education for young children.
Another drastic change was in their perceptions about
behavior management. Prior to their program entrance, the
participants did not have a good understanding about what
might cause children's misbehaviors. After their education
in the program, they were able to better analyze young chil-
dren's behaviors and propose ways to communicate with
them. Another change was observed in their perceptions
about preschool curriculum. Previously, they were not aware
of the value of children's play, songs, and games on chil-
dren's development. With their education, they were able to
understand how play and musical/movement activities in
early ages could contribute to children's development.
RQ6:What were the hardest and the most pleasurable sides of
teaching young children?
The participants shared their
thoughts about the hardest and the most pleasurable sides of
teaching young children. Thirty-four students answered this
question, and several listed more than one aspect for the
answer. The themes emerged from the participants'responses
about the hardest and most pleasurable sides of teaching are
displayed in Table 4 with the students' response rates.
Majority of the responses (38.64%) pointed out that main-
taining a certain level of physical energy and patience was the
hardest part of teaching young children.Aparticipant stated, "I
am afraid that I will not be patient and loving when I get older
doing this job." Having adequate professional knowledge and
skills to teach young children appeared as the second theme
(22.73%). One of the students mentioned that the hardest side
of preschool teaching is "fear of giving wrong knowledge and
not being able to getting down at their level." Classroom man-
agement followed with 18.18% of the responses. A student
stated, "The hardest part is not being able to control the class."
Interestingly, under the program experience section, the
"classroom management" course was among the least rated
courses by the students. A total of 13.64% of the responses
revolved around the perception that the hardest side of teach-
ing young children was the thought of their impact on chil-
dren. A participant wrote, "Children are very open to take in
negative things therefore we need to be very careful." Finally,
6.82% of the responses mentioned working with families as
the hardest part of preschool teaching.
The responses about the most pleasurable parts of
teaching young children revealed four themes (Table 4):
positive impact on children, having fun with children,
young children, and approaches to teaching. A total of
32.65% of the participants stated that the most pleasurable
side of teaching preschool children was to see the positive
impact of their teaching on young children. A participant
stated, "We will shape those children's personalities and
we will teach children all the right, good, and nice things."
Almost equally rated was having fun and playing with
children (30.61%). One of the participants mentioned,
"You are always happy and it is possible that you may
laugh all day. Being on the go and having fun are very
nice." Young children were mentioned as the most plea-
surable side in 20.41% of the responses. "Most pleasur-
able side is to see children's purity that they hug to show
their love . . ." a participant wrote. Finally, 16.33% of the
responses referred to the nature of teaching in preschool
as the most pleasurable side.Astudent stated, "Creativeness
is at the highest level. It [preschool education] is not a
passive education."
When the themes for hardest side and most pleasurable
sides of teaching young children were compared, the former
focused on more concrete issues related to professional
knowledge and skills, guiding children's behavior, and main-
taining physical strength to keep up with young children's
energetic nature, whereas the latter seemed to idealize pre-
school as an environment that is always fun and that children
are pure, innocent, and fun creatures. In fact, this thought
pattern is a recurring theme throughout teacher education
studies conducted in different cultures (Aldemir, 2007; Cook
& Young, 2004; Knowles & Holt-Reynolds, 1991).
RQ7: What are the qualities of their ideal preschool educa-
tion? The participants were asked to list the qualities of their
ideal preschool education. One participant did not respond to
this question, and two participants listed the qualities of their
ideal preschool teacher instead of preschool education; there-
fore, 32 responses were coded for this question. All the
responses revolved around six areas, and some responses
included more than one quality (Table 5).
Curriculum theme received a rating of 33.33%. Being
child-centered, supporting creativity, and being play based,
hands-on, and planned according to multiple intelligences
and constructivism were the qualities of an ideal preschool

curriculum mentioned by the participants. Physical environ-
ment was the focus of 19.70% of the responses. Providing
independence to make choices, and having rich stimuli and
adequate materials were the qualities of a preschool environ-
ment listed by the participants. Social-emotional atmosphere
also received 19.70% of the responses. According to the par-
ticipants, an ideal preschool education should provide a
social-emotional atmosphere that is also democratic, social-
izing, and trustful. Responsiveness theme emerged from
18.18% of the participants'responses. Developmental appro-
priateness and appealing to children's interests have been
listed by the participants to emphasize the responsiveness of
a preschool education. Only 6.06% of the participants men-
tioned family involvement and focused on the quality that a
program must collaborate with families and recognize family
as a unit. The last theme teacher factor was mentioned by
only 3.03% of the participants. Having teachers who hold at
least a bachelor's degree in early childhood education (ECE)
and encouragement for teachers to research were two quali-
ties related to teacher factor mentioned by the participants.
RQ8: What are the students' perceptions of a preschool
teacher? All the students responded to this question with
more than one quality area (Table 6).
The responses were categorized under three themes: per-
sonal qualities, professional attitude, and professional
knowledge and skills. Personal qualities (40.40%) appeared
as the most important professional quality with professional
attitude being the second (32.45%), and professional knowl-
edge and skills is the third (27.15%). Among the personal
qualities, being patient was the most frequently (36.07%)
mentioned quality. Being loving, although it was the highest
second quality, was mentioned in only 19.67% of the
responses. These two qualities by far surpassed the others
listed (e.g., tolerant, genial, cheerful, energetic, etc.) under
the theme of personal qualities.
As for the professional attitude theme, the participants
mentioned love for children most frequently (26.53%) in
their responses. Being creative was the second most fre-
quently (16.33%) mentioned quality. The professional quali-
ties theme seemed to be more concrete in revealing specific
knowledge and skill areas preschool teachers must possess.
For instance, knowledge about profession was mentioned in
the 24.95% of the responses while good communication
skills/using Turkish language properly was perceived almost
equally important (21.95%). In addition, 19.51% of the par-
ticipants thought updating professional knowledge on a reg-
ular basis should be part of professional knowledge and
skills.
RQ9:What are preservice teachers' concerns about teaching in
the future?The last question asked the participants to state
their concerns about their future teaching. Two students did
not mention any concern. The rest of the responses focused
on eight concern areas (Table 7).
One of the areas the students were most concerned was
working with families (21.15%). A participant stated that his
biggest concern is "having to work with families who think
they know everything but do not know anything." Concerns
about professional knowledge and skills were equally impor-
tant in the 21.15% of total responses. The students seemed to
lack the confidence about their knowledge, pedagogical
skills, and planning and instructional skills. For example, a
student mentioned that her concern was "not being able to
answer their [children's] questions adequately." The third
concern category was classroom management (15.38%). A
student stated, "What I am most concerned is whether I will
be able to maintain classroom control." Some of the answers
(13.46%) focused on concerns over maintaining a profes-
sional attitude throughout the years that they will be in the
profession. A participant mentioned, "I am concerned about
whether I will be able to have the same attitude toward my
profession and show the same performance when I get older."
Materials, resources, and funding were another concern area
found in the 11.54% of the responses. A total of 7.69% of the
responses were about working with children with special
needs. As 5.77% of responses were about concerns related to
working with administration and other staff members in the
school, problems in the education system in general was a
concern for 3.85% of the participants.
Discussion
The demographic data showed that the majority of the stu-
dents came from working-class families with little to no pre-
school experience as a child. Although the Elementary
Education Regulations in Turkey (MoNE, 2012b) authorizes
each elementary school to open kindergarten classrooms
depending on the need in their respected locations, kinder-
garten entry is still not compulsory in Turkey. Considering
the fact that this group of preservice teachers are the first
graduates of preschool teacher education programs after the
revision of teacher education curricula in Turkey in 2007, it
is very critical for these teacher candidates to advocate the
preschool education's positive impact on children's aca-
demic performance and social-emotional adaptation to for-
malschooling.Anotherfindingfromthestudents'background
information showed that the love for children was the most
important reason to choose preschool teaching as a career.

This finding was parallel to the participants' listing of love
for children as one of the most important qualities a pre-
school teacher must possess.
To understand their program experience, the participants
were asked to list the courses they favored the most.
While art courses (e.g., drama, music, rhythm, and dance)
were among the most favored courses, the students paid little
attention to practica/field experience courses, classroom
management, and parent education. Furthermore, the course
on children with special needs did not receive any recogni-
tion from the students. Interestingly, when the students' con-
cerns about their future teaching were examined, it was
found that the main concern areas were revolved around
working with families, professional knowledge and skills,
and classroom management. Practica/field experience as part
of teacher training is to help preservice teachers continue the
transformation they experience throughout their program
courses and gain crucial professional dispositions to work
with young children and their families, teach in preschool
classroom, and be an advocate for the profession. More col-
laboration with local education directories and schools could
help communicate goals and expectations of practicum
courses and create volunteer opportunities for teacher candi-
dates to apply their knowledge and skills that they gained
during their program experience. Also such collaboration

could increase teacher candidates' confidence about their
professional capabilities.
The participants were asked to explain the changes in
their perceptions about preschool education before their
enrolment and after their education in their teacher education
program. The changes revolved around three themes: neces-
sity of preschool education, behavior management, and pre-
school curriculum. Without any exception, all the participants
mentioned a drastic change in their pre- and after-program
perceptions. The authors implicate that in many cases, peo-
ple need an outside agency to make them aware of the
changes and transformations that took place in their attitudes
and perceptions. Teacher educators may help preservice
teachers discover the transformation in their perceptions
throughout their program experience. Morrison (2006) called
this process as "reflective practice," which is a cycle of
thinking before teaching, thinking while teaching, and think-
ing after teaching. As the teacher candidates observe this
positive transformation in their perceptions, they can be
more self-confident and have high self-efficacy in facing the
challenges their professional teaching career may bring to
them.
One of the recurring issues throughout all the themes that
emerged from the students' responses was the lack of recog-
nition of families. As mentioned previously, working with
families was a subject, course area, and a professional qual-
ity that gained little recognition from the participants, yet it
was one of the highest rated concern areas about their future
teaching. Graue and Brown (2003) mentioned preservice
teachers' limited perceptions about families of children.
Morris and Taylor (1998) explain that lack of course work to
prepare preservice teachers effectively to work with parents
was one of the reasons for teachers' lack of knowledge and
skills for parent involvement. In case of inadequate course
work and practica/field experience to work with families,
teacher candidates may rely on their observations and per-
ceptions that they formed through their cultural upbringings
and their 12 or more years of schooling experience to com-
municate with families of young children. Preschool educa-
tion is where parent involvement occurs at the highest level;
therefore, preservice teachers should be presented with
opportunities to challenge their existing perceptions about
families of young children and study culturally appropriate
ways of involving them in the education of their children.
One of the points emerging from this study was the par-
ticipants' lack of confidence about classroom management.
This subject also appeared as one of the hardest sides of pre-
school teaching in the participants' responses. Classroom
management has also been cited as an important concern for
other Turkish preservice teachers by Çakmak (2008). The
authors of this study propose that preservice teachers should
be able to realize that the effective classroom management
skills are part of designing a developmentally appropriate
preschool curriculum. Therefore, each curriculum and
method course and practicum/field experience course needs
to emphasize integrating classroom management strategies
in unit and curriculum plans. Further support should be pro-
vided by mentor teachers and student teaching faculty by
providing immediate feedback to preservice teachers upon
their curriculum implementation. A healthy mentor teacher
and preservice teacher relationship has been defined as cru-
cial for the practicum/field courses (Loizou, 2011).
The participants listed some qualities that they think a
preschool teacher must possess. As three themes (i.e., per-
sonal qualities, professional attitude, and professional
knowledge and skills) emerged from this area, the partici-
pants listed more qualities for the areas of personal qualities
and professional attitude than they did for professional
knowledge and skills. Unfortunately, knowledge and skills
such as knowledge of child development, planning activities
for different intelligences, capturing children's attention, use
of technology, knowledge about children's interests, being a
good observer, and communicating with families were men-
tioned only once by different participants. Love for children
appeared as the most important personal and professional
quality, which received a higher rating than all the qualities
for professional knowledge and skills, in the students'
response. Certainly, one cannot deny the fact that love for
children must be one of the prerequisites to teach and care for
young children. However, as Morrison (2006) indicated, an
early childhood professional needs to have competence in
"personal characteristics, educational attainment, profes-
sional practice, and public presentation" (p. 5). A teacher's
personal qualities and professional dispositions cannot be
separated from the teacher's professional identity as one
must acknowledge that professional knowledge and skills
are also part of this identity. To maintain the balance across
those three areas, teacher candidates should examine differ-
ent dimensions of the teaching profession and what makes a
teacher highly qualified to teach young children. Teacher
education programs can help preservice teachers examine
effective teaching practices via case studies, real classroom
experiences, and vignettes, and, most importantly, analyze
their own teaching implementations. Such reflective practice
(Morrison, 2006) will help teacher candidates comprehend
the different dimensions of preschool teaching and give
equal importance to each area in this profession.
Perceptions about working with children with special
needs hardly gained attention from the participants.Although
there is state support, incentives, and subsidies provided to
children with special needs and their families, many schools,
classrooms, and teachers are unprepared to accommodate the
varying needs of children with exceptional needs
(Er-Sabuncuolu & Diken, 2010). Perhaps this is a good
opportunity to address and reemphasize the importance of
training future preschool teachers adequately to work with
children with special needs and their families. Preschool
education is the period where problems in development and
learning are detected, and the preschool teachers are the ones
who need the ability to observe and detect potential risks and
10 SAGE Open
delays in children (Er-Sabuncuolu & Diken, 2010).
Therefore, teacher education programs in Turkey have a
great responsibility to help teacher candidates gain skills and
knowledge to accommodate the needs of all children. In fact,
recently there has been more emphasis on special education
and inclusion applications in the preschool classrooms for
young children with special needs in the last revision of the
preschool teacher education program in 2012 (MoNE,
2012a).
In sum, the purpose of this study was to examine pre-
school preservice teachers' perceptions about teacher and
teaching in the Turkish teacher education context. The data
collected through a survey instrument were coded into cate-
gories to explore the patterns in a group of Turkish preschool
preservice teachers'perceptions. The results of the study pro-
vided important insights on Turkish preschool preservice
teachers' perceptions about teacher and teaching. Yet, the
study had its limitations. Perhaps one and the most important
limitation of the study was the subject size. It would have
been more robust to conduct the survey with the graduates of
the program few years back. However, currently, there is no
organized system in this program to keep in touch with the
program alumni; therefore, the possibility of reaching out to
the recent graduates did not exist. The researchers are aware
that the findings of this qualitative study can only be general-
ized in the context wherein the study was conducted.
Nevertheless, the study can have important implications for
preschool teacher education in Turkey and in other countries
as well, and help the international readers perceive preschool
education from a different cultural perspective. This study
and other studies on preservice teachers' perceptions within
specific cultural contexts could present valuable information
and insights for academicians, teachers, administrators, and
lawmakers in the field of preschool education around the
world.
