Abstract
Objective: To examine the potential relationship of EPCR polymorphisms and the risk of sepsis in
a Chinese population.
Methods: Snapshot SNP genotyping assays and DNA sequencing methods were used to detect
polymorphisms of the EPCR gene, rs2069948C/T (2532C/T) and rs867186A/G (6936A/G), in 64
patients with sepsis and in 113 controls. Soluble EPCR (sEPCR) was measured by ELISA.
Results: There were significant differences in the allele and genotype frequencies of EPCR gene
rs2069948C/T and allele frequencies of rs867186A/G between male and female patients and
controls. Females carrying rs2069948 C/T genotype or T allele and males carrying rs867186 A
allele were associated with a significantly increased risk of sepsis. Plasma sEPCR levels of sepsis
patients were higher than controls and showed no correlation with EPCR gene polymorphisms.
Conclusions: EPCR polymorphisms may be associated with increased risk of sepsis, but this has
no effect on the release of sEPCR in patients with sepsis.

Introduction
Sepsis is a clinical syndrome caused by
infections.1 The pathophysiology of sepsis
is triggered by the components of bacteria,
viruses, fungi and parasites. These sub-
stances activate cell transmembrane recep-
tors and cellular signaling pathways to
increase the release of pro-inflammatory
cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6 and

kines such as IL-1RA, IL-10 and IL-4.2­5
The inflammatory response of the body can
lead to sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock and
multiple organ failure and eventual death.6
Early diagnosis and intervention can
improve the outcome, but the incidence
and mortality rate of sepsis are still
unacceptably high.7­9
Activated protein C (APC) plays a role in
the response of the host against sepsis.10,11
As part of the coagulation system, anoma-
lies in the functions of the endothelial
protein C receptor (EPCR) have been
demonstrated in developing sepsis.12,13
EPCR is a PC/APC high-affinity receptor
mainly expressed on the surface of endothe-
lial cells in most organs of the human
body.14 It not only participates in the acti-
vation of PC,15 but also mediates anti-
inflammatory and cytoprotective effects in
sepsis through APC.16
EPCR is a type I transmembrane pro-
tein, homologous to the major histocom-
patibility complex class I (MHC I)/CD1
family of proteins,17 which are related to
immune and inflammatory responses.
Decreased EPCR or blocking of APC
binding to EPCR in septic animal models
could enhance the inflammatory response
to LPS, resulting in an increase in mortal-
ity.18 Plasma sEPCR levels are associated
with EPCR polymorphisms, whereby
patients with elevated sEPCR levels are
more likely to develop sepsis.19
EPCR has three main haplotypes,
referred to as A1, A2 and A3.20,21 The A3
haplotype is associated with venous
thromboembolism (VTE)22 and idiopathic
recurrent miscarriage.23 Elevated levels of
sEPCR were observed in subjects carrying
the A3 haplotype and this was more
common in Asian Indians than in white
Europeans.24­26 Low levels of plasma
sEPCR are related to the A1 haplotype,
which is a protective factor associated with
many different diseases.27 Carriers of A1
and A3 haplotypes may have a reduced risk
of developing myocardial infarction and
sepsis.28,29
Rs867186A/G is one of the main SNPs of
the A3 haplotype and rs2069948C/T is clas-
sified as the A1 haplotype. The EPCR gene
polymorphism rs2069948 has been reported
to be associated with estrogen and proges-
terone receptor positivity in breast cancer.30
Another study showed that rs2069948 was
associated with lymphoid PROCR mRNA
expression and a decrease in survival of
healthy subjects during follow-up.31 The
mutant genotypes (AG and GG) as well as
allele G of rs867186 are associated with
susceptibility to deep vein thrombosis.32
However, another study showed that the
rs867186 A/G polymorphism was not asso-
ciated with the risk of VTE.33
In the present study, we hypothesize that
rs2069948 C/T and rs867186 A/G poly-
morphisms of EPCR are associated with
susceptibility to or protection against sepsis,
and that certain alleles might affect the
production of sEPCR. The study also aims
to assess the clinical relevance of poly-
morphisms of the EPCR gene, the incidence
of sepsis and the effects of sepsis on EPCR
production in vivo.
Materials and methods
Patients
This study was approved by the ethics
committee of the Affiliated Hospital
of Youjiang Medical University for
Nationalities, Guangxi, PR China. All par-
ticipants provided written informed consent.
One hundred and seventy-seven patients and
controls (120 males and 57 females) were
enrolled in this study. Sixty-four patients
(26 females and 38 males, average age
57.45 Æ 15.80 years) with sepsis were
recruited from July 2014 to December 2015
in the intensive care unit at the Affiliated
Hospital of Youjiang Medical University for
Nationalities, Guangxi, PR China. The
Liang et al. 505
patient characteristics are shown in Table 1.
The inclusion criteria followed the diagnos-
tic criteria for sepsis, severe sepsis and septic
shock as defined by the American College of
Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care
Medicine (ACCP/SCCM).34
Exclusion criteria were as follows: aged
<18 years or >80 years, a history of
cardiac arrest, undergoing emergency sur-
gery and receiving an immunosuppressive
therapy. One hundred and thirteen subjects
(31 females and 82 males, average age
55.34 Æ 11.69 years) were recruited into
the control group over the same period of
time. All subjects in the control group
underwent a routine medical check-up in
the outpatient clinic of the hospital. None
of the control subjects had any medical
conditions associated with infection, a his-
tory of immunosuppressive therapy or
cardiac arrest.
DNA extraction and PCR assay. Five milliliters
of venous blood was obtained from controls
and patients during the first 24 h after ICU
admission. DNA was extracted using a
DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen,
Germany) in accordance with the manufac-
turer's instructions. Extracted DNA was
stored at À70C for further assays.
Nucleotide sequences of EPCR (Gene
ID: 10544) obtained from GenBank were
used as reference sequences. The primer
sequences used for this study are shown in
Table 2. The PCR reaction in 20 mL con-
tained 1xGC-I buffer (Takara), 3.0 mmol/L
Mg2þ, 0.3 mmol/L DNTP, 1 U HotStart
Taq polymerase (Qiagen Inc.), 1 mL of
DNA samples and 1 mL of multiple PCR
primers. The PCR procedures were as fol-
lows: 95C for 2 minutes; 11 cycles of 94C
for 20 sec, 65C for 40 sec and 72C for
90 sec; followed by 24 cycles of 94C for
20 sec, 59C for 30 sec and 72C for 90 sec;
then 72C for 2 min followed by 4C until
the reaction mixtures were removed from
the cycler.
Genotyping procedure. Purified PCR products
(SNaPshot Multiplex Kit, ABI, USA)
were sequenced using the ABI3730XL
sequencer, in accordance with the instruc-
tion manual. GeneMapper 4.1 (Applied
Biosystems Co., Ltd., USA) was used to
analyze the data collected from the genetic
analyzer.
Soluble EPCR assay. Plasma levels of patients
and controls were measured by using
commercially available human sEPCR
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kits (CSB-E09901h, CUSABIO,
China), in accordance with the manufac-
turer's instructions.
Statistical analysis. All data were analyzed by
Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS
17.0). Conformity to Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium was determined to assess the

goodness-of-fit of models to data by com-
paring the detected genotype frequencies
with the theoretical genotype frequencies
in the control participants (Table 3).
Differences in genotype and allele frequen-
cies of EPCR were analyzed by chi-square
(2) test and Fisher's exact test (two-sided
analysis) when appropriate. Multivariate
logistic regression analysis was performed
with the haplotypes while controlling for age
(continuous variable). Odds ratios (ORs)
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
determined to assess the relative risk con-
ferred by a particular allele or genotype.
Comparisons between sepsis cases and con-
trol participants were performed by
Student's t-test and chi-squared test. Phase
program was used for estimating the haplo-
types and their frequencies based on a
Bayesian algorithm.35 For ELISA data,
one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's mul-
tiple comparison test was used for compari-
sons. Two-tailed P values<0.05 were
considered as statistically significant.
Results
There were no statistically significant differ-
ences between the control and patient
groups in gender and age (each P > 0.05).
The frequency of the genotypes studied also
showed no difference by using Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium analysis in the control
group (P > 0.05), which indicated that the
subjects used in these experiments were
representative of the population (P > 0.05;
Table 3).
The genotypic and allelic frequencies for
SNPs are shown in Tables 4, 5 and 6. There
were no significant differences of genotype
and allele frequencies of EPCR rs2069948C/
T and rs867186A/G between the sepsis
and control groups (P > 0.05; Table 4).
The distributions of allele and genotype
frequencies of EPCR rs2069948C/T and
allele frequencies of rs867186A/G were sig-
nificantly different between men and women
with sepsis (P < 0.05; Table 5). Females

were found between plasma sEPCR levels
and EPCR gene polymorphisms (results not
shown).
Discussion
In this case-control study, the EPCR
polymorphisms of rs2069948C/T and
rs867186A/G were analyzed and compared
regarding their associations with the sEPCR
levels. The results showed that females
carrying the rs2069948 T allele and C/T
genotype and males carrying the rs867186 A
allele had an increased risk of sepsis.
Although the levels of sEPCR in patients
with sepsis were higher than in controls,
there was no significant difference between
the two groups and no correlations were
found between plasma sEPCR levels and
EPCR gene polymorphisms. These findings
suggested that EPCR gene polymorphism
may be associated with susceptibility to
sepsis, but has no effect on the release of
sEPCR in patients with sepsis.
Many risk factors for the development of
sepsis have been identified, including burns,
pathogens, surgeries and hemorrhages.36­39
Genetic factors have also been reported to
be involved in the pathophysiology of
sepsis,40 with clinical outcomes being asso-
ciated with genetic variability.41 The TLR2
16934TA genotype tends to be associated
with susceptibility to infections in severely
injured trauma patients.42 In addition,
PECAM-1 373C/G polymorphism is
known to be significantly associated with
increased susceptibility to septic shock and
also increased serum levels of sPECAM-1.43

polymorphisms were also shown to be sig-
nificantly associated with the development
of sepsis.44
The protein C anticoagulant system is
involved in the pathophysiology of sepsis.16
As a member of the protein C system, EPCR
regulates protein C by activating it to play a
role in many pathological processes such as
anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic path-
ways and reduce the overall permeability of
endothelial cells.45­48 Mutations in the
EPCR gene have been reported to be rele-
vant to the occurrence and development of
sepsis by regulating the cytoprotective and
anticoagulant effects of APC to influence the
expression of EPCR and sEPCR.28,49
Plasma sEPCR competes with the mem-
brane form of EPCR (mEPCR) to bind to
PC/APC to inhibit the effect of mEPCR.50
In this study, no correlation was found
between plasma sEPCR levels and EPCR
gene polymorphisms. It is possible that the
loci chosen here are responsible for these
negative results. Variations in the genes that
encode the EPCR functional proteins may
be located in other as-yet-undiscovered loci.
The limited number of sepsis cases in this
study and the inclusion of patients from
different regions may be further reasons for
the results obtained.
A previous study showed that rs867186
was associated with higher sEPCR levels
and higher levels of circulating protein C
antigen, and that there was no association
between rs867186 and the risk of coronary
heart disease (CHD), stroke or mortality,
while rs2069948 was associated with an
increased risk of stroke and all causes of
mortality.31 It has also been reported that
the rs867186-GG genotype was signifi-
cantly associated with protection against
severe malaria.51 In contrast, another study
has shown that the rs867186-G allele may be
correlated with cerebral infarction.52 The
presence of the rs867186-AG genotype in
patients with venous thromboembolism may
be considered to be a risk indicator
of thrombosis.53 Moreover, it has been
demonstrated that rs2069948 C/T was
associated with breast cancer,30 which is
consistent with our findings. The results
from our study suggested that females
carrying the rs2069948 T allele or C/T
genotype and males carrying the rs867186
A allele had an increased risk of sepsis.
However, the results of these studies
are inconsistent, which is probably due
to ethnic differences in the Chinese popu-
lations studied, so more research is
warranted.
Our results indicate that there was no
relationship between different genotypes
and plasma sEPCR levels in sepsis patients
as well as in control groups. These results are
similar to those in other recent studies
carried out on Germanic and American
populations.33,54
Conclusions
The rs2069948 T allele and C/T genotype
and the rs867186 A allele may contribute to
the development of sepsis, but appear to
have no effect on the release of sEPCR in
patients with sepsis.
