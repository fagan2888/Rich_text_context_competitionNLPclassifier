Abstract
Researchers have speculated that negative life events are more common in troubled neighborhoods, amplifying adverse
effects on health. Using a clustered representative sample of Chicago residents (2001­03; n = 3,105) from the Chicago
Community Adult Health Survey, we provide the first documentation that negative life events are highly geographically
clustered compared to health outcomes. Associations between neighborhood context and negative life events were also
found to vary by event type. We then demonstrate the power of a contextualized approach by testing path models in which
life events mediate the relation between neighborhood characteristics and health outcomes, including self-rated health,
anxiety, and depression. The indirect paths between neighborhood conditions and health through negative life event
exposure are highly significant and large compared to the direct paths from neighborhood conditions to health. Our results
indicate that neighborhood conditions can have acute as well as chronic effects on health, and that negative life events are
a powerful mechanism by which context may influence health.

Introduction
Negative life events are powerful potential triggers in producing
stress-related health effects [1,2]. These stressful and potentially
traumatic events occur more frequently and earlier among those
with low socioeconomic status [2­7]. In a review of mechanisms
linking psychological factors and health, Miller and colleagues [8]
hypothesized that negative life events may also be more common
in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Variation in neighborhood
conditions due to segregation may also be a key contributor to
health disparities [9,10]. Context may to some extent itself predict
or condition stress, emotions, and coping behaviors directly [11­
13]. We provide the first evidence that neighborhood conditions
are related to the prevalence of recent negative life events, and
demonstrate the importance of this link for psychological well-
being.
Most survey-based research on life events has implicitly treated
life event risk as a risk faced by individuals. We argue that
individuals are embedded in communities, that some communities
experience disproportionate social, demographic, and physical
hazards (6­8), and that these hazards are intertwined. The phrase
``riskscape'' [14] conveys the idea that particular physical and
social risks (or resources) in a place are not independent but rather
interact and accumulate. This growing appreciation that contex-
tual risk is more than the sum of risks from individual toxicants or
stressors has given rise to a new emphasis on documenting the
nature of these cumulative exposures [15]. Just as a concentration
of poverty, social dysfunction, and crime in a community may lead
to worse health outcomes [16], we expect that certain neighbor-
hood conditions may independently increase the risk of future
negative life events. Meanwhile, negative life events may also have
triggered downward social mobility. Downward social mobility
may co-occur with moves to worse neighborhoods or staying in
declining neighborhoods. Hardships and traumatic experiences in
certain communities may be associated with subsequent social,
psychological, and health problems. Thus, we hypothesize strong
links between recent negative life events and neighborhood
conditions.
Life events are not purely exogenous shocks but rather are
correlated with exposures to other risks and resources in one's
environment. Variation in recent experience of negative life events
is one important mechanism by which deleterious neighborhood
effects may relate to downstream health outcomes. However,
existing research has not yet assessed whether neighborhood
conditions are linked with negative life event experience. Using
data from a representative sample of adults clustered in 343
contiguous Chicago neighborhoods, we report the prevalence of a
variety of negative life events in a representative urban sample and
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93539
examine which life events are most clustered geographically. To
facilitate comparison with prior literature, we present individual
sociodemographic predictors of any recent life event, followed by
predictors of 4 categories of life events, based on typologies
commonly used in the trauma literature. We report on how a wide
range of neighborhood conditions is differentially related to
exposure to the life event categories. Finally, we use path models
to demonstrate that the indirect association of neighborhood
conditions and multifaceted psychological well-being mediated
through life event experience are stronger than the direct
neighborhood ``effects.''
Life Events in Spatial Context
Importance of Life Events. Exposure to negative life events
has been associated with a variety of adverse physical and
psychological health outcomes, including symptoms of depression
[17] and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [18], reduced life
satisfaction [19], inflammation [20], and chronic physical condi-
tions [21]. In addition, research has shown that traumatic
experiences over the life course can exert greater adverse effects
on psychological and physical health outcomes compared to single
incident events [22­24]. Given that the majority of individuals
exposed to stressful and traumatic events experience more than
one event during their lifetime [25], it is important to understand
the cumulative effects of exposure to multiple negative life events
as well as the differential impact of exposure to various types of
events separately.
Life Events in Context. Life events have typically been
viewed as individual risks. However, life event risks and
experiences take place in physical locations which carry different
risks for exposure to certain types of events. Negative life events are
more common in places that are undergoing periods of violence
and hardship, such as war and natural disaster. Dropping out of
school and teenage childbearing are also much more common in
troubled neighborhoods [26]. Durkheim's classic work on suicide
[27] demonstrated differences in suicide rates between Catholic
and Protestant places. Also, characteristics of individuals' social
networks (embedded in place) may increase the risk of experienc-
ing a negative life event. For instance, older adults are particularly
likely to experience the death of social contacts, simply because
many of the people they know are also older adults.
Thus, life events occur within socially- and spatially-variant
contexts. While a few papers have discussed a specific context in
which life event data were collected (place; i.e. [28]), research has
rarely considered how various conditions in locations in which
respondents spend time (space) may relate to their experience of life
events. Life experiences may vary across neighborhoods as a result
of variations in worldviews, economic opportunities, physical
safety, social support, and access to resources (e.g., transportation,
health care, child care). Certain aspects of family dynamics, such
as the role of older adults in the family structure and the amount of
responsibility placed on children and young adults, may also vary
culturally across neighborhood contexts. These differences may in
turn influence the risk (and impact) of negative life events. Only
one prior study looked at life events in context, finding
neighborhood disadvantage and disorder amplified the association
between negative life events and the onset of major depression
among African-American women [29].
Health in Context. Advancing research concerning contex-
tual effects on health will require greater attention to concrete
mechanisms by which specific features of neighborhoods ``get
under the skin'' [9,30]. One way to begin looking for contextual
causal mechanisms is to investigate the geographic clustering of
risks, resources, and outcomes. When residential neighbors have
more similar values of a variable than those who live farther away
(geographic clustering) [31], this suggests the potential for a
neighborhood mechanism. To some extent, geographic clustering
can be spurious ­ the result of composition effects. For instance,
neighborhoods populated by older adults will have higher
mortality because older adults have higher mortality. Neighbor-
hood effects could also be due to selective migration related to the
variable being studied. For example, the life event ``death of
spouse'' would be more common in Sunbelt retirement towns
because older adults migrate there in later life expecting to live
well, not because retirement towns are dangerous. Negative life
events may also be contagious, rather than causal or composi-
tional, such as when gang violence results in a string of reprisals.
Once geographic clustering has been documented, identifying
which of these mechanisms is at play and to what extent should be
an important research goal.
To illustrate, crime rates vary substantially across intra-urban
neighborhoods [32], and living in a high-crime area may influence
health in multiple ways. The effort to avoid crime may influence
health behaviors ­ to avoid being victimized, residents may avoid
walking for exercise or transportation and spending time outdoors.
Continual fear of crime may also result in chronic activation of
stress processes, which may lead to physiological dysregulation and
later disease [33]. Fear of crime may also influence social
behaviors such as avoiding interacting with neighbors, community
participation, and moving away, triggering a reciprocal effect such
that fear of crime induces conditions which may foster social
disorganization [34], which in turn leads to higher crime rates.
Although prior research has focused on chronic pathways like fear,
our goal is to examine the acute effects of neighborhood conditions,
which are experienced only in the instance in which the feared
event occurs (e.g. a resident is a victim of a crime) (Figure 1). This
distinction between chronic and acute effects applies to many
aspects of place, such as fear of police vs. being unnecessarily
frisked, traffic stress vs. having an accident, or anxiety while home
alone vs. being robbed. It is likely that the health effects of actually
experiencing the feared event (the acute exposure) is much greater
than the effect of the fear (the chronic exposure), even though far
more people are exposed to the chronic than the acute stressor.
Pathways. Figure 2 illustrates potential pathways between
neighborhood characteristics and health outcomes through life
events. Crucially, we do not know the comparative amount that
stress- or event-based pathways influence downstream health. As a
result, we might overestimate the contextual effect of fear of
Figure 1. Acute Versus Chronic Effects of Neighborhood
Conditions. If the event does not occur, health outcomes may be
affected negatively by stress and by the opportunity costs of steps
taken to avoid the event or to mitigate its effects if it did occur. For
example, fear of crime may lead someone to avoid leaving home to
make friends, or to install a burglar alarm. This is the chronic path. In
contrast, if one is criminally victimized, there is a potential for
immediate effects on psychological or physical health. This is the acute
path.

negative events because sometimes those events actually occur,
and both fear of and exposure to the event may influence the same
health outcome. Thus life events might mediate and or moderate
neighborhood conditions. For example, a higher crime rate
increases the risk of victimization, and having been victimized
might increase the stress response to exposure to further crime risk.
The pathway through life events may also suppress a direct effect.
Failing to account for acute as well as chronic effects might thus
result in model misspecification. Most neighborhood studies
include individual controls and neighborhood predictors, and
many recognize potential confounding between the two levels (i.e.,
between individual and neighborhood income/wealth and race/
racial composition [35]). But little attention has been given to
potential confounding between individual and contextual stressors.
Researchers interested in stress mechanisms typically introduce a
neighborhood measure into a model, understanding the direct
pathway to be the total effect. Our main goal is to draw attention
to a potential additional pathway not previously emphasized in the
literature. Increased risk of a negative life event having occurred to
respondents in a certain neighborhood (causal or spurious) may
result in an individual experiencing the event, and experience of
the event may influence their health in an acute way that is distinct
from the chronic effect. Alternatively, a negative life event may
propel an individual into worse contexts. In other words, life
events may mediate/confound/suppress the relationship between
neighborhood characteristics and health outcomes. (Confounding
and mediation are computationally equivalent in cross-sectional
models, and attribution of the effect type depends on the
researchers' understanding of the pathways involved [36].)
Specifically, our aim is to illustrate that when neighborhood
predictors are entered into a model predicting a health outcome,
those neighborhood predictors are correlated with the recent
experiences of individuals in prior contexts. For this reason we use
retrospective rather than prospective data, and focus on where
respondents live at the time of data collection rather than when the
event occurred, consistent with the data framework used in
research on stress and neighborhood effects on health.
Materials and Methods
Sample
To assess the association of negative life events with neighbor-
hood characteristics and health, we use a multilevel probability
sample of 3,105 adults age 18 and older, with analyses weighted to
represent the Chicago population in 2000. The Chicago
Community Adult Health Study (CCAHS) consists of face-to-face
interviews (71.8% response rate), systematic social observation, a
community survey, and linkage with archival data. The survey
elicits individual level data about socioeconomic, psychosocial,
behavioral factors, health, and perceived social and physical
characteristics of neighborhoods. Neighborhoods in the CCAHS
are operationalized as clusters (NCs) of contiguous census tracts,
based on the clustered sampling framework of the Project on
Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods [37] and
reflecting physical barriers, local cultural knowledge, and cluster
analyses of census data so that the NCs are relatively homogeneous
and cover the entire city [38]. On average 9 respondents live in
each of the 343 NCs. Analyses are weighted to represent Chicago's
2000 Census population in terms of age, race/ethnicity, and sex.
The sociodemographic composition of the sample has been
reported elsewhere [13]. There are substantial numbers of
minorities and a broad range of adult ages and socioeconomic
statuses [39]. Data collection for the CCAHS was approved under
the University of Michigan Health Sciences and Behavioral
Sciences Institutional Review Boards. Respondents gave written
informed consent, and data were deidentified prior to public
release.
Measurement
Negative Life Events. Respondents were asked about their
experience of 16 specific negative life events in the last 5 years
(Table 1). CCAHS selected events using a preliminary field study
based on the Duke Life Events Inventory [1,40]. To examine the
extent to which neighborhood conditions differentially relate to
various types of life events, events were classified into several
dichotomous categories (Table 1). First, events were classified as
respondent-directed or other-directed (i.e., events that affected the self
primarily through their impact on others). Negative and traumatic
events that are directly experienced are generally associated with
greater adverse outcomes (e.g., symptoms of depression, PTSD)
compared to negative and traumatic events directed at others [41].
Second, in accordance with the A1 PTSD diagnostic criterion
(DSM-IV-R, [42]), an event was categorized as a trauma if it was
life threatening for the individual or someone else involved. Events
that meet the A1 criterion are generally associated with greater
PTSD symptoms than non-A1 events [43,44]. Events that were
non-life threatening were classified as a hardship.
Neighborhood Conditions. The 11 measures of neighbor-
hood conditions are standardized across NCs. Based on recent
research reporting distinct relations between multiple dimensions
of contextual socioeconomic conditions and outcomes, neighbor-
hood disadvantage and affluence are assessed separately [38,45].
Principal components factor analysis of 2000 Census NC-level
measures yielded two factors [46]. The neighborhood disadvan-
tage factor loads negatively on high family incomes, and positively
on low family incomes, high levels of poverty, public assistance,
unemployment, and vacant housing. The affluence factor loads
positively on measures of the proportion of employed civilians ages
16 and over in professional or managerial occupations, the
proportion of individuals ages 25 and over who have completed 16
or more years of education, and median home values. Disadvan-
tage and affluence capture distinct but correlated aspects of
neighborhood socioeconomic status, much as income and
education represent distinct aspects of individual socioeconomic
status. Many neighborhoods low in disadvantage are also low in
affluence [47]. The traditional family structure scale is composed
of percent of families headed by females (reverse-coded), and
percent of residents married. The physical disorder measure used
here comes from the Systematic Social Observation (SSO) [48,49]
component of the CCAHS, in which trained raters assessed 9
ecological conditions (i.e. graffiti, litter, abandoned cars, broken
glass) using standardized criteria.
The perceived measures are aggregated to the neighborhood
level from individual responses to the Community Survey section
of the CCAHS. Scales are based on the PHDCN [50] and use
approximately five questions for each scale. Aggregation of reports

from all respondents within the NC minimizes the importance of
each respondent's response, so that the respondent's own
perceptions of neighborhood will not overly influence results
[11]. To aggregate individual item responses to factors at the
neighborhood level, empirical Bayesian hierarchical linear models
were used [51]. The procedure adjusts for missing items, controls
for individual socioeconomic characteristics, and improves neigh-
borhood-level estimates by borrowing information from across
locations [51]. A perceived disorder measure was also studied
because both measures are widely used; social stigma can amplify
perceptions [52]. The ``collective efficacy'' scale includes 10 items
from two subscales and assesses a shared willingness (social
cohesion) to take action to enforce collective norms (social control)
[53]. The total victimization scale captures experiences of being a
victim of crime (i.e. assault, property theft, robbery) in the
neighborhood. Anomie assesses the extent to which residents
report a disconnection from basic societal rules (e.g. agreeing with
``Laws are made to be broken''). Reciprocal exchange focuses on
the exchange of favors, advice, material goods, and information
which make up a social support network within the community
[54].
Sociodemographics. Previous research has shown that
individual sociodemographic factors predict both the experience
of negative life events [2] and the kinds of neighborhoods in which
individuals live [55]. We therefore adjust for individual sociodem-
ographics: race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, non-
Hispanic other, with non-Hispanic White as the reference
category), variables indicating whether the respondent is female
and is a first generation immigrant, and dummy variables for age
(30­39, 40­49, 50­59, 60­69, and 70 years and over, with 18­29
as the reference group), education (12­15 years or 16+ years, with
0­11 years as the reference category), and annual income (of
respondent and their spouse if applicable) (less than $5,000,
$15,000­$39,999, $40,000 and over, and missing, with $5,000­
$15,000 as the reference category). Categories are used for age in
order to highlight non-linearity.
Health Outcomes. Three health outcomes were selected as
commonly studied with respect to both life events and neighbor-
hoods. Descriptions of the depression (CESD) [56], anxiety [57],
and self-rated health [58] measures used are given elsewhere.
Analytic Plan
The analysis was organized in several stages. First, the
prevalence of exposure to each life event in the five years prior
to the interview is reported, along with the level of neighborhood
similarity of exposure to each event. Neighborhood (i.e. NC)
similarity is assessed using intraclass correlations (ICCs), where the
classes are neighborhoods. ICCs are reported for each life event
category, without and with adjustment for sociodemographics.
This method partitions variance in multilevel models attributable
to individual versus neighborhood levels as a ratio of the between-
neighborhood variance to the sum of the between-neighborhood
variance and the between-individual, within-neighborhood vari-
ance. The ICC for logit models is calculated as t/(t+3.29), where t
is the variance of the random intercepts [59]. ICCs can only be
compared within a given dataset, and comparison with other
findings from the CCAHS are discussed. Particularly given the
level of statistical complexity in the measure and the low

prevalence of some events, the ICCs should be treated as general
indicators of the magnitude of clustering rather than as absolute
ranks.
Second, a binary indicator of whether the respondent has
experienced a recent life event is aggregated to the neighborhood
level using the method previously described, and the results
mapped. Third, population-weighted regression models assess
associations between individual-level characteristics (e.g. socioeco-
nomic status) and life event categories. Fourth, mixed-effects
models are estimated to assess the relationship between neighbor-
hood characteristics and life event categories. Mixed-effects
models are necessary because multiple respondents living in each
neighborhood violates the regression independence assumption.
These population-average robust models with population weights
include controls for individual socio-demographics not shown.
Fifth, to check for sensitivity to neighborhood spatial boundaries,
the association between life events and disadvantage is assessed at
various spatial scales. Finally, path analyses of the associations
among 2 of the most frequently studied [60] neighborhood
characteristics (disadvantage and perceived disorder), any recent
life event, and 3 health outcomes (self-rated health, depression,
and anxiety) are presented. These population-weighted models
were estimated using Mplus software [61], with controls for
individual sociodemographics not shown.
Results
Overall, 72.7% of the sample experienced at least one negative
life event in the last 5 years. Table 1 reports the prevalence of each
life event in Chicago in 2001­3. Frequencies of individual life
events varied widely across event type, with some events occurring
among less than 1% of the sample (e.g. life-threatening illness/
accident of a spouse/child) and other events occurring among
more than 20% of the sample (e.g. financial difficulties, life-
threatening illness of someone else close). For each event in
Table 1, ICCs are reported with and without adjustment for
covariates. Previous reports of geographic clustering using the
same dataset (CCAHS) indicate that most measures of neighbor-
hood physical and social conditions have ICCs above 0.13, some
negative emotions (e.g. pessimism) have ICCs of 0.06­0.09, while
some physical health and psychological measures have ICCs under
0.05 [13,62]. Thus, the level of clustering of job loss without
adjustment for covariates (0.18) is substantial, almost reaching the
range of purely neighborhood-based characteristics such as
perceived violence in the neighborhood (0.23). The clustering of
death of child (0.13) and life-threatening illness/accident to
spouse/child (0.13) approximates that of neighborhood-level
variables with stronger links to individual characteristics, such as
perceived social cohesion (0.14). A moderately high level of
clustering was observed for another group of life events, including
a move to a worse neighborhood, assault, financial difficulties,
robbery/burglary, life-threatening illness/accident of respondent,
legal trouble, and unemployment of respondent or household
member), which may be consistent with a high degree of clustering
of factors at the individual level, and is comparable to the level of
geographic clustering previously reported in the same dataset
(CCAHS) for negative emotions [13], drinking [63], and exercise
[63]. Finally, events including divorce, personal job loss, life-
threatening illness/accident of someone else close, and death of
someone close, have lower clustering, similar to rates of clustering
observed in the CCAHS for measures such as smoking [63],
systolic blood pressure, and hopelessness [13].
To assess whether the comparatively high level of clustering
observed for negative life events is primarily driven by the
tendency of similar individuals and households to live near each,
Table 1 also presents ICCs adjusted for sociodemographic
variables. In Chicago much of the demographic sorting is due to
racial/ethnic and income segregation. Thus, the difference in the
levels of clustering between the unadjusted and adjusted ICCs
gauges the contribution of segregation and other sorting by
neighborhoods to similarity in the experience of negative life
events. When adjustment produces larger ICCs, as for divorce and
death of someone close, they are interpreted as resulting from
disparities running counter to neighborhood selection (e.g. when
Whites report greater fear of crime and also live in safer
neighborhoods [63]). Overall, our results indicate that clustering
of events persists even when adjusted for sociodemographic
clustering, suggesting that life events are spatially dependent in
their own right.
To visually illustrate the extent to which negative life events are
geographically clustered, Figure 3 presents a map of the empirical
Bayes estimates of the neighborhood prevalence of any recent life
event. The highest quartiles of prevalence are colored darker.
Consistent with our other results, life events are not randomly
distributed with respect to geography. Rather, a clear spatial
distribution is discernible such that recent life events are more
common in more disadvantaged areas of the city, as well as
downtown. Chicago is bounded by Lake Michigan on the east,
and the central business district is centrally located on the shore.
Respondents living in the outlying areas of the city (distant from
downtown, with more single-family houses and wealthier residents)
have experienced few recent life events, adjusted for sociodemo-
graphics. These are the same outlying areas previously identified
as having high levels of social capital [64]. Meanwhile, the central
business district (``The Loop'') area also has a comparatively high
prevalence of negative life events, despite the low disadvantage of
its residents.
To facilitate comparison with prior research, Table 2 reports
associations of socio-demographic variables with life event
categories. Consistent with previous research [2,25,65], men were
significantly more likely to report respondent-directed events,
hardships, or any negative life event. Compared to non-Hispanic
Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks were more likely to report respon-
dent-directed events and hardships, and Hispanics were more
likely to report hardships. Compared to third generation
immigrants, first generation immigrants reported far fewer events
across all categories, and second generation immigrants reported
fewer events overall and respondent-directed events. Older adults
also reported having experienced fewer events in the last five years,
except for traumas, consistent with findings that negative life
events are more common early in the life course [3,65,66]. Having
moderate ($30,000­$50,000) and higher ($50,000 or higher)
income also predicted having recently experienced fewer negative
life events, compared to those in the lower income group
($10,000­$30,000), while the very low income group (often the
young and the old) was not significantly different from the lower or
higher group (not shown).
Given the high levels of clustering reported in Table 2, the next
analytic phase focuses on the relation between negative life events
and conventionally studied neighborhood measures. Table 3
examines associations of specific features of neighborhoods with
life event categories. Several neighborhood conditions (both
objective and perceived) are strong predictors of any recent life
event. Certain types of events, specifically hardships and respon-
dent-oriented events tended to be related to the neighborhood
measures. The types of events which were significantly associated
with neighborhood predictors also tended to be those which were
more geographically correlated. Respondents do not necessarily

live in the same neighborhoods as those emotionally close to them,
consistent with there being few significant associations of
neighborhood characteristics and events to others. Also, many of
the traumatic events are related to illness, which is among the
more spatially diffuse phenomena studied here. Residents of
disadvantaged neighborhoods have greater odds of having recently
experienced any event (except other-oriented events). However,
affluence is not associated with the risk of negative life events,
consistent with a literature showing distinctive findings for
disadvantage and affluence.
Other social composition measures also predict life events:
having a greater proportion of older adults in the neighborhood is
associated with lower odds of respondent-oriented events, hard-
ships, and overall events. Perhaps neighborhood family composi-
tion is related to the likelihood of reporting an event to an
acquaintance if non-traditional family composition increases the
number of people viewed as family. This finding is also consistent
with a protective effect of traditional family contexts. Conditions
linked with crime (robbery rate and total victimization) and
disorder (objective or perceived) strongly predict greater odds of an
event directed at the respondent, hardships, and any event, with
weaker or no relationships with events directed at others and
traumatic events (probably because of the importance of health in
this category). The three measures of neighborhood norms and
behaviors show divergent patterns of prediction. Anomie increases
odds of events directed at the respondent, but not hardships.
Collective efficacy decreases odds of respondent-oriented events,
hardships, and any event, while reciprocal exchanges between
neighbors are non-significant, lending support to the literature on
the benefits of collective efficacy beyond other forms of social
interaction.
Several studies have found differences in neighborhood
``effects'' as a function of how neighborhoods are defined [67].
As a cross-check, additional models (not shown) were estimated in
which disadvantage and affluence were assessed in concentric rings
(``buffers'') around the respondents' geocoded home addresses with
diameters of 250 m, 500 m, 1 km, 1.5 km, 2 km, and 3 km. At
each spatial scale, disadvantage coefficients in Poisson models
predicting the count of recent life events, adjusting for sociodem-
ographics, were nearly identical (1.1,b,1.2; p,.001). Affluence
remained non-significant across spatial scale in the buffer models.
This indicates that neighborhood definition does not drive results.
Finally, illustrative results from path analyses of neighborhood
characteristics (disadvantage and perceived disorder), life events
(any recent event), and 3 health measures (worse self-rated health,
depression, anxiety) are given in Table 4. In each model, the

neighborhood characteristic strongly predicts a recent life event,
and a recent life event strongly predicts the health outcome. By
contrast, direct associations of the neighborhood variable with
health are smaller. Analogous results appeared in models on the
subsample of respondents who had lived in their neighborhoods
for 5 years or more (not shown). The highly significant Sobel [68]
test statistics (which tests the indirect effect of neighborhood
conditions on health outcomes through recent negative life events)
indicate that recent life events partially mediates the associations of
neighborhood conditions and health outcomes.
Discussion
These findings illustrate the importance of considering acute
rather than only chronic pathways between context and health.
Experience of negative life events ­ to varying extents ­ are
patterned by residential neighborhood context. Previous research
on the prevalence of stressful and traumatic life events has tended
to consider individuals as the unit of analysis. The evidence in this
paper suggests a new direction linking research in a variety of fields
(criminology, social networks, urban geography) with the literature
on neighborhood health and health disparities. Exposure to actual
negative life events is a distinct neighborhood-health pathway
beyond fear of events, and may serve as an important mechanism
by which context influences stress levels.
Several features of the analysis limit the ability to draw causal
links between neighborhoods and events, which is not our goal.
Cross-sectional models cannot directly assess risk of event
occurrence in neighborhoods. The survey questions do not specify
where the events took place. Future data collection may be able to
more explicitly capture how events relate to dynamic spatial and
social contexts. Respondents who experience negative events
closely linked to place, such as muggings, may be more likely to
move to places where they feel safer or where they have no
unpleasant memories. Or, negative life events may lead to
downward socioeconomic mobility, resulting in residence in less
desirable areas. These issues do not detract from our aim to
demonstrate the association between recent exposure to negative
life events and contextual conditions. Future prospective studies
could help establish any dynamic longitudinal relationship
between residential attainment/choice and life events.

It is also important to note that respondents are not equally
exposed to all events, and not all potential negative events are
measured. For instance, divorced respondents must have first been
married, and context is associated with both divorce and marriage.
Contextual conditions are associated with not only occurrence of
an event conditional on eligibility but also eligibility itself. This is
because we are interested in the population-level relationship
between neighborhood conditions and occurrence of an event.
While the structured interview questions covered a broad range of
events, many other stressful and potentially traumatic life events,
as well as a range of positive events, may be consequential.
However, when prompted with an open-ended question, respon-
dents reported relatively few events not previously queried.

Our goal is to quantitatively demonstrate the potential for
embedded and interactive experience of conventionally-measured
negative life events in risky and resourceful places. Extensive prior
ethnographic work has previously described the cumulative nature
of life experience burden in poor communities [69]. Whereas
ethnographic work can help elucidate stress pathways in individ-
uals and specific communities, spatial demographic work can
provide prevalences necessary for comparison across space. The
ability to consider spatial variation in life events is required in
order to investigate how geographic factors cause life events, how
spatial clustering of life events may result in biased estimation of
spatial effects, and how life events may lead to further events for
those nearby. The results also show that some life events are
spatially clustered in ways not driven by poverty, and future work
is needed to understand the reason.
Both chronic strain and acute life events may influence physical
and mental health over the life course. Preventive efforts may
benefit from a careful discourse distinguishing between the impact
of fear of events and objective experience of events on health. The
work presented here lays a foundation of basic findings on which
to bridge research concerning trauma with the literature on
neighborhoods and health. We urge stress researchers to consider
the embedded nature of specific events within spatial and social
network contexts.
