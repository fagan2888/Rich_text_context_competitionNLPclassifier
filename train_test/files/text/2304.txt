Objective: To study immigration, U.S. nativity, and return migration as risk factors for violence among
people of Mexican origin in the U.S. and Mexico.
Methods: Cross-sectional surveys in the United States (2001-2003; n=1,213) and Mexico (2001-
2002; n=2,362). Discrete time survival models were used. The reference group was Mexicans living in
Mexico without migrant experience or a migrant relative.
Results: Mexican immigrants in the U.S. have lower risk for any violence (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.5,
95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.4-0.7). U.S.-born Mexican-Americans were at higher risk for
violence victimization of a sexual nature (for sexual assault, HR = 2.5, 95%CI 1.7-3.7). Return
migrants were at increased risk for being kidnapped or held hostage (HR = 2.8, 95%CI 1.1-7.1).
Compared to those without a mental disorder, those with a mental disorder were more likely to suffer
any violence (HR = 2.3, 95%CI 1.9-2.7), regardless of the migrant experience.
Conclusions: The impact of immigration on the occurrence of violence is more complex than usually
believed. Return migrants are more likely to suffer violence such as being held hostage or beaten by
someone other than a partner.

Introduction
International migration is associated with a broad range of
changes in health status and exposure to health risks.1,2
One area of concern is exposure to violence. Prevention
of violence is an important public health goal and
exposure to violence is a risk factor for a variety of
physical and mental health conditions, including post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).3-5 The vulnerability of
migrants during transit between countries,6-8 both from
and to sending countries, and the risks associated with
social disadvantage in their destination country9 put this
group at a particular risk.
Previous studies have focused on exposure to violence
in refugee populations.10,11 In these populations, expo-
sures tend to be extremely high, largely due to pre-
migration stresses which were the underlying causes of
displacement.12 However, little is known about violence
exposures among labor migrants, who comprise the large
majority of international migrants in the world today. It is
uncertain whether the immigration process is associated
with an increase or decrease in all forms of violence.10,13-16
Ongoing connections between immigrants and the
families they left behind provide an additional potential
mechanism for migration to influence suicidality in the
migrant-sending populations,17 but there is no prior
research on other forms of intentional violence.
This study examines migration and violence in the
context of the largest sustained labor migration in the
world today, that between Mexico and the United States.
Mexico is a society that has witnessed a large increase in
violence in recent years18,19 as well as an extraordinary
migration movement to the U.S.20 We are especially
interested in testing whether immigration would increase
the likelihood of a first episode of violence in newcomers,
i.e., first-generation immigrants, because of the uncer-
tainty and negative life events that may occur in the
migration process12 and settlement into a society where
Hispanics in general have a lower socioeconomic status
than those of an Anglo ethnicity. On the other hand, we
might also expect that with increasing social ties, better
jobs, and educational attainment, all forms of violence
would decrease in the second generation, that is, among
U.S.-born Mexican-Americans. Migration from Mexico to
the U.S. has been shown to be associated with large
increases in risk for psychiatric disorder,21-23 an established
risk factor for exposure to violence,24,25 so that assessment

of prior psychiatric disorders is needed, though rarely done,
when studying the role of immigration on the first onset of
violence. In order to test these hypotheses we make use
of a unique dataset, which includes assessments of timing
of migration, a large list of violence experiences, and a
broad range of psychiatric conditions in population samples
of the Mexican general population and the U.S population of
Mexican origin.
Our main goal is to examine the first onset of violence
among Mexicans and U.S.-born persons of Mexican
origin residing both in Mexico and the U.S. We took
advantage of our study design to consider whether the
age at migration preceded the age of onset of violence
and whether a psychiatric disorder increased the like-
lihood of suffering violence. Our main hypothesis is that,
when compared to Mexicans nationals in Mexico,
violence will be higher among Mexican immigrants in
the U.S., but lower among U.S.-born persons of Mexican
origin. Other comparisons of interest among two under-
studied groups, the possible increase in violence among
return migrants and family of migrants, will also be
addressed here.
Methods
Sample
We combined data on 2,362 participants from the
Mexican population who answered questions related to
violence from the Mexican National Comorbidity Survey
(MNCS)26 with data on 1,213 respondents of Mexican-
origin population in the United States from the closely
related Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys
(CPES), which included the National Comorbidity Survey
Replication (NCS-R) and the National Latino and Asian
American Study (NLAAS).27-29 All surveys follow the
methodology of the World Health Organization's World
Mental Health Survey Initiative.30 The combined sample
is weighted to represent the U.S. Mexican-American
population using weights developed for this purpose.27,31
Full data on nativity and age at immigration are available
for a total of 3,575 respondents from both the U.S. and
Mexico. The response rate for the MNCS was 76.6%,
70.9% for the NCS-R and 75.5% for the Latino sample in
the NLAAS.22,23 Study procedures were approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of Harvard Medical School,
the University of Michigan, and the National Institute of
Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente.
Definition of migrant groups
We define five mutually exclusive groups representing a
range of exposure to the U.S. across this transnational
population23: 1) U.S.-born Mexican-American respon-
dents; 2) migrants from Mexico; 3) return migrants living
in Mexico after having spent at least 3 months in the U.S.
for work or study; 4) non-migrants in Mexico with a
migrant among their immediate family members; and 5)
non-migrants in Mexico with no migrant in their family.
The first two groups are from the CPES population and
the last three groups from the MNCS population.
Assessment of violence
The World Mental Health version of the Composite
International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI)32 mea-
sures 21 different lifetime traumatic events, out of which
eight types were considered here as violence-victimiza-
tion: ever been kidnapped or held hostage; ever been
badly beaten by parents; ever been badly beaten up by
spouse or romantic partner; ever been beaten up by
anyone else; ever been mugged, held up, or threatened
with a weapon; ever been raped; ever been sexually
assaulted (other than rape); and ever been stalked. We
studied here only the first episode of these traumatic
events.
Assessment of other covariates
Analyses also used sociodemographic information col-
lected in the WMH-CIDI on gender, age, marital status,
education, and DSM-IV psychiatric disorders, categorized
as any mood disorder (major depressive disorder and
dysthymia) and any anxiety disorder (panic disorder,
agoraphobia without panic disorder, social phobia, gen-
eralized anxiety disorder and PTSD), any substance use
disorders (alcohol abuse, drug abuse, alcohol depen-
dence with abuse, and drug dependence with abuse),
and conduct disorder. A term for any mental disorder was
added as a control variable in all models that estimated
the risk of violence for the five migration groups. Given
the importance of mental disorder as a possible risk factor
by itself, we included the estimates for this term in the
final models presented below. This term represents the
risk of suffering violence (any violence and by type) for
those with a mental disorder compared to those without a
mental disorder, and it is adjusted for the migration
groups.
Statistical analysis
We used a design-based statistical analysis strategy for
point and variance estimates and hypothesis testing,
using standard survey data analysis procedures to
account for design effects arising from the use of
stratification, clustering and unequal selection probabil-
ities in the component surveys.33 We used weights
developed by CPES biostatisticians34 for use in design-
based analyses that combine the NCS-R and NLAAS to
estimate that a total 15.76 million Mexican Americans
were in the U.S. sampling frame.34 The Mexican
sampling frame does not overlap with the U.S. sampling
frame, so in the combined sample we treated each frame
as separate domains for purposes of design-based
variance estimation.33,35 Hence, we calibrated the
MNCS weights to represent 40.6 million individuals,
based on the estimated number of 18 to 65 years old
lived in households in towns . 2,500 inhabitants in the
Mexican Census of the Populations and Households,
2000.36
We used a discrete-time event history analysis with
time-varying covariates, implemented using a discrete
proportional hazards regression model on a dataset with

person-years as the units of analysis,37-39 to study
variation in risk of first onset of violence across the five
migration groups defined above while statistically adjust-
ing for covariates. The main outcomes that we studied
were lifetime violence-victimization (any and by type of
violence). The key predictor is immigration group, in five
categories. The person-years analyses allow us to take
account of the temporal ordering of migration, onset of
psychiatric disorders, and first occurrence of violence of
specific types38 and to use design-based estimation
methods to account for survey design effects.33 Our
use of discrete time event history analyses38 relied on
retrospective age-at-onset reports to establish a temporal
order between the predictors and the outcomes. Design-
based standard errors for logistic regression coefficients
and for pairwise contrasts between them were estimated
using the Taylor linearization method40 with SUDAAN
version 10.0141 and were used in Wald tests for statistical
significance and for producing 95% confidence intervals
(95%CI) for adjusted hazard ratios.
Results
While the families of migrants and the Mexicans living in
Mexico without a migrant experience or a migrant relative
(Mexican population for short) have larger proportions of
females than males, the opposite is true for the other
three groups, especially the return migrants (Table 1).
The U.S.-born population has the largest proportion of
respondents in the older group, while the families of
migrants and the Mexican population tend to be much
younger and the current migrants are more concentrated
in the middle years.
Table 2 shows the lifetime prevalence of any violence
and violence by type, for the total population and
separately for males and females. Starting with the total,
about 43.6% reported any experience of violence, with
the highest prevalence of any violence found among the
return migrants (51.7%) and the lowest among the
current immigrants from Mexico (31.8%), with the
Mexican population in the middle (41.6%). In all groups,
the most common experience was ever mugged, held up
or threatened with a weapon, and in most groups, the
least common was ever kidnapped or held hostage.
Males were only slightly more likely to report any violence
(45.5%) compared to females (41.6%), but large differ-
ences in the prevalence by type of violence experienced
were found for male and female groups. Among males,
being mugged, held up, or threatened with a weapon and
being badly beaten up by anyone else was much more
common than among females, who were in turn more
likely to experience being beaten up by a spouse or
romantic partner and violence of a sexual nature.
We present a survival curve of one of the most
common outcomes with a middle and early-age of initial
victimization, i.e., rape (Figure 1), for which an unex-
pected result was found. Here, the U.S. born group was
the most affected, followed by the Mexican population
and the current migrants in the U.S. (with current
immigrants showing rape rates that followed those of
U.S.-born among females, data not shown).
Considering all violence types together among current
immigrants, most events (60.9%) occurred before migra-
tion, especially because most cases of being beaten by
parents and being raped occurred while in Mexico
(Table 3). On the other hand, most of the violence from
being kidnapped, beaten up by a partner, threatened with
a weapon and stalked happened after immigration.
Table 4 presents the results of survival models that
estimate differences in risk for violence across immigration
groups, adjusted for sex, age and any mental disorder, for
the total population and separately for males and females.
The variable any mental disorder was introduced in this
multiple regression equation as a time-varying dummy
variable, in which those without a mental disorder are the
reference group. Marital status and education were also
considered as possible confounders, but did not affect the
estimates for migration groups and psychiatric disorders
and were dropped from the final model for simplicity and to
obtain more stable estimates. The reference group for all
comparisons was the Mexican population living in Mexico
without migrant experience or a migrant relative. A similar
model was also fitted separately by sex and we tested for
the presence of interactions. In two instances we could not
fit an interaction term (for ever badly beaten up by spouse
or romantic partner and for ever raped, neither of which
had occurred to males in some of the immigrant
categories) and in all other instances no significant
interaction term was found. We therefore focus here on
the results for the total sample.

risks. The U.S. born had increased risk for all violence of
sexual nature, but was less likely to suffer from being
beaten by parents. Immigrants currently in the U.S. were
less likely to report ever mugged, held up or threatened
with a weapon and being beaten by parents. The return
migrants were less likely to be beaten up by a romantic
partner, but more likely to suffer from being held hostage
and for being beaten by anyone else. The families of
migrants were more likely to have ever been beaten by
parents, but less likely to have ever been beaten up by a
romantic partner.
In all models from Table 4, a term for any mental
disorder was introduced and was associated with higher
risk of any violence with a hazard ratio of 2.3 (1.9-2.7) for
the total population. For the total population, those with a
mental disorder also had higher risk for all specific types of
violence, with odds ratios ranging from 1.8 (1.4-2.2) for the
risk of ever mugged, held up or threatened with a weapon
to 3.9 (2.8-5.4) for badly beaten up by anyone else.
Discussion
We found violence to be quite common among this
population, in both males and females, but with some
important differences in the type of violence by sex.
Secondly, although violence was associated with immi-
gration, the nature of this association varied across the
specific type of violence. Contrary to our expectations,
exposure to violence tended to be lower rather than
higher among the current immigrant group and higher
rather than lower among the U.S. born of Mexican origin.
Third, we found that having a mental disorder was a
predictor of exposure to violence victimization throughout
this population.
Our overall prevalence (43.6%) for violence was much
higher than the one reported in a large metropolitan U.S.
city3 (37.7%) or the prevalences reported recently for five
ethnic groups in the U.S. population, which ranged from
16.3 to 29.3%.13 An analysis of more specific types of
violence reported by other surveys24,42-44 also suggest
higher prevalences in our survey, with one exception.42
The U.S. born in our sample reported a higher prevalence
of rape than those of previous American surveys,24,43
including the Hispanic population in Roberts et al.13 The
reasons for such high prevalence are not immediately
apparent, but differences in survey methodologies,
definitions of violence, location of surveys, and timing of
inquiry should also be considered.
We did not corroborate our main hypothesis that
identified current immigrants in the U.S. as the group
most prone to suffer violence. In fact, our findings suggest
that current Mexican immigrants in the U.S. are less
affected by all sorts of violent acts, especially those that in
Mexico are common during early childhood (child
maltreatment) and the middle years (mugged, held up,
or threatened with a weapon); at the same time, they are
unlikely to have experienced sexual violence, which
becomes surprisingly common among the second gen-
eration of Mexican-Americans. Though surprising, this
finding is consistent with those from a study of a diverse
Hispanic sample in South Florida.45 The experience of
violence among the Mexican immigrant groups, pre- and
post-migration, has been linked to their rates of sub-
stance use in the U.S.,45,46 suggesting that lower levels of
traumatic experience among immigrant females of
Mexican origin may be related to the low prevalence
of substance use disorders in this group. An analysis of
the possible impact of the immigration experience on
disorders such as depression22 or substance use,23
controlling for specific types of violence, is beyond the
scope of the present paper, but clearly a promising
avenue for future research. Our second hypothesis, that
U.S.-born respondents of Mexican origin would have
lower rates of violence when compared to Mexican
nationals in Mexico, was only corroborated for being a
victim of parental violence. Five of eight forms of violence
were increased among this group. One of the most
surprising results of our survey was the high risk for
violence of a sexual nature among the U.S.-born of
Mexican origin. It is interesting that national results13
suggest that Hispanics have lower rates of unwanted sex
compared to Whites, and we add now that second-
generation Mexicans may be approaching the rates seen
among Whites, with consequences for the future occur-
rence of PTSD, among other mental consequences of
victimization. The reasons associated with this increase
in such an extreme form of violence in the second
generation are unknown, and we can only speculate on
such causes at this moment. A driving idea among
Mexican nationals is that immigration to the U.S. will bring
a better standard of living and a more secure environment
for those settling in the U.S. Our results do not coincide
wholly with this idea, as those settling in the U.S. may be
at greater risk than Mexicans in Mexico.
Those immigrants that return to their home country and
the families that the immigrants leave back home are
traditionally understudied groups in migration and mental
health research, because data from sending countries are
necessary but seldom available. The lack of other studies
focusing on these groups precludes comparison of our
results, but we can nevertheless point to main findings
and avenues for future work. Return migrants in Mexico
are a vulnerable group for victimization such as kidnap-
ping and being beaten, as we showed here, and this
should be a great concern to Mexican public health
authorities and those responsible for violent crimes in the
country. The perception that those immigrants are, by
Mexican standards, a wealthy group that brings with them
financial resources after a life of hard work in the U.S.
may put this group at high risk of being targeted by
organized crime, as their high rate of being beaten by a
stranger also suggests. We also showed that the relatives
of migrants are more likely to show violence to their
children, and that this violence itself may be related to the
migration process when deciding within the family which
of its members will emigrate.47 The dynamics of these
families and the decision process that culminates in
choosing the family member that will migrate are usually
seen solely as an economic process, but subjective
reasons are also at play, as this work has shown.

It is well known that the occurrence of violence may
lead to PTSD3 and other forms of psychopathology,42,48
such as depression,49 substance abuse,50 and suicid-
ality,51 and violent events such as rape and sexual abuse
may also impact an array of mental disorders.52 On the
other hand, serious mental disorders have been shown to
increase the risk for violent victimization, such as that
studied here.53 Other more common forms of psycho-
pathology, such as drug use disorders, are associated
with lifestyles that may put someone at increased risk of
suffering from violence such as being beaten up or
threatened with a weapon,49,54 and alcohol use and
alcohol use disorders are associated with all sorts of
accidents and violence-related death.55,56 Our results
somehow extend the findings from Hiday54 on victimiza-
tion among persons with serious mental disorders such
as psychosis, but are unique in that we used a large
series of other, more common mental disorders. These
disorders are not usually thought to be associated with
increased personal vulnerability, but we showed that they
are related to most forms of victimization when taking into
account whether the disorder precedes the occurrence of
violence. Models to explain why psychopathology may be
related to violence are complex,57 and digging into the
specific link between each disorder and the occurrence of
each form of violence is beyond the scope of this paper,
but our results clearly show that mental disorders may
have a broad negative consequence for this population.
Monitoring the safety of patients with these common
mental disorders should also be an important task in
clinical settings and among professionals dealing with
their re-insertion into the community.
The limitations of this survey are worth mentioning.
First, these analyses used data on retrospectively
reported ages of first occurrence of experiences of
violence that are subject to recall error, which probably
means that the results we report are conservative.
Multiple episodes of violence, sometimes referred to as
chronic violence, are not covered in this report. Second,
retrospective data on the exact ages at immigration and
return migration are lacking in the MNCS, which limited
our ability to more fully model the relative timing of
outcomes and exposure in these subgroups. Third, the
MNCS sampling frame did not include the most rural
parts of the country, which lessens the representative-
ness of the MNCS target population for the entire source
population of Mexican immigrants to the U.S., limiting our
ability to control for pre-migration factors. Fourth, despite
using the same diagnostic interview, both surveys
differed in several ways, including the auspices of the
survey. We cannot rule out the possibility that these
methodological differences contributed to the observed
differences in prevalence estimates of violence in the
CPES compared to the MNCS. A special concern is the
report of sexual-related violence and whether females in
Mexico would experience and report some less extreme
forms of sexual aggressions and coercions as violence
against themselves. The fact that forms of severe
violence, including rape, that are equally prosecuted in
Mexico and the U.S. are still more reported among the
U.S.-born lead us to believe that differential reporting of
less extreme forms of sexual violence, if present, should
not account for all of our findings here. Finally, Mexican
migration to the U.S. is driven by economic reasons and
the search for a better standard of living, and whether our
results could be applied to other samples of migrants,
homeless, and displaced persons is a matter for further
studies.
Despite these limitations, we found that the impact of
immigration on the occurrence of violence is more
complex than usually believed, with differences across
migration groups varying across different types of
violence. Each migration group should be targeted for
specific interventions for reducing specific forms of
violence, but, at the same time, all members of this
population with a prior mental disorder should be a focus
of interventions.
