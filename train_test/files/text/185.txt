ABSTRACT. Objective. To measure the effect of envi-
ronmental tobacco smoke (ETS) on respiratory health in
a national sample of young children.
Methods. The study evaluated children 2 months
through 5 years of age participating in the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988 to 1994.
The group was a representative sample of the US popu-
lation (N  7680). A parental report of household smok-
ing or maternal smoking during pregnancy ascertained
ETS exposure. Respiratory outcomes were based on pa-
rental report of wheezing, cough, upper respiratory in-
fection, or pneumonia in the last 12 months and chronic
bronchitis or physician-diagnosed asthma at any time.
Logistic regression was used to adjust for age, sex, race/
ethnicity, birth weight, day care, family history of al-
lergy, breastfeeding, education level of head of house-
hold, and household size.
Results. Approximately 38% of children were pres-
ently exposed to ETS in the home, whereas 23.8% were
exposed by maternal smoking during pregnancy. ETS
exposure increased chronic bronchitis and three or more
episodes of wheezing among children 2 months to 2
years old and asthma among children 2 months to 5 years
old. For household exposure, a consistent effect was seen
only at >20 cigarettes smoked per day. Adjusted odds
ratios for increased risk (95% confidence interval) for
household exposures (>20 cigarettes smoked per day vs
none smoked) and maternal prenatal exposure (prenatal
smoking vs no smoking), respectively, for children 2
months to 2 years old were chronic bronchitis, 2.5 (1.6,
4.1); 2.2, (1.6, 3); three or more episodes of wheezing, 2.7
(1.7, 4.2), 2.1 (1.5, 2.9); and for children 2 months to 5 years
old were asthma, 2.1 (1.4, 3.2); 1.8 (1.3, 2.6). Reported use
within the past month of prescription medications for
asthma (-agonists or inhaled steroids) was not different
between those with asthma reporting ETS exposure and
those reporting no exposure; percent of patients with
asthma reporting use of medication by household expo-
sure was 0, 25.7%; 1 to 19 cigarettes smoked per day,
32.9%; and >20 cigarettes smoked per day, 23.1%; percent
of patients with asthma reporting use of medication by
maternal smoking during pregnancy was no, 28.9%; yes,
22.7%. Among children 2 months to 2 years of age ex-
posed to ETS, 40% to 60% of the cases of asthma, chronic
bronchitis, and three or more episodes of wheezing were
attributable to ETS exposure. For diagnosed asthma
among children 2 months through 5 years old, there were
133 800 to 161 600 excess cases. Among exposed children
2 months through 2 years of age, there were 61 000 to
79 200 excess cases of chronic bronchitis and 126 700 to
172 000 excess cases of three or more episodes of wheez-
ing.
Conclusions. ETS exposure is common among chil-
dren in the United States. The reported prevalence of
asthma, wheezing, and chronic bronchitis was increased
with ETS exposures. No statistically significant increase
in the prevalence of upper respiratory infection, pneu-
monia, or cough was associated with ETS exposure. ETS
exposure has little effect on the respiratory health of
children between 3 and 5 years of age, with the exception
of asthma. ETS appears to increase the prevalence of
asthma rather than the severity as measured by medica-
tion use. These findings reinforce the need to reduce the
exposure of young children to ETS. Pediatrics

Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is a highly
prevalent respiratory irritant. A recent meta-
analyses concluded that ETS plays an impor-
tant role in the health of children.1 However, in re-
gard to respiratory health, the report noted there
were gaps in the literature. Many of the samples
studied were small and may not have been suitable
to generalization. Few studies have data on the many
factors that contribute to respiratory health in the
first 5 years of life (eg, birth weight, socioeconomic
status, family history of atopy, day care attendance,
and so forth), thus making it impossible to identify
the independent contribution of ETS. The effect of
ETS appears to change depending on the age stud-

ied. Much of the work in young children has focused
on the first year of life, when a strong effect has been
reported consistently.2­4 The few studies that have
attempted to evaluate the change in the effect of ETS
over the first 5 or so years of life have found the effect
of ETS is limited primarily to the first several years of
life.5,6
The Third National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nations Survey (NHANES III), a representative sam-
ple of the US population, offered a unique dataset in
which information on ETS exposure, respiratory
health, and cofactors was collected. The objectives of
these analyses are to evaluate the effect of ETS expo-
sure on the reported respiratory health of children 2
months through 5 years of age in the United States
while taking into account the relevant cofactors and
to calculate the excessive number of cases of the
various respiratory conditions attributable to ETS
exposure.
METHODS
Study Population and Sample Design
NHANES III was conducted from 1988 to 1994 by the National
Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, Atlanta, GA.7 A stratified multistage clustered prob-
ability design was used to select a sample of the civilian noninsti-
tutionalized US population 2 months of age. A total of 81 loca-
tions were selected for inclusion in the final sample. The protocol
included a home interview followed by a physical examination in
a mobile examination center. The study was approved by the
National Center for Health Statistics' Institutional Review Board.
Demographic Characteristics
Age at the time of interview is reported as age in years at the
last birthday, except for children 1 year of age, for whom age in
months is reported. Self-reported race/ethnicity was categorized
as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American, or
other. The education level of the head of the household was the
highest grade completed. Household size was based on the num-
ber of persons living in the house regardless of relationships.
Variable Definition
Parents were asked whether the child was ever breastfed or fed
breast milk and the age when the child stopped breastfeeding
completely. Children who were breastfed until at least 1 month of
age were classified as ever breastfed. A family history of allergies
was the self-report of asthma or hay fever at any age in either
biologic parent. Day care was defined as attendance at a day care
center or nursery school where there were six or more children for
at least 10 hours per week for 1 or more months. Birth weight was
derived from birth certificates (87.2%) and maternal report at the
time of the household interview (12.8%), when the birth certificate
was not available. Birth weight was used as a categoric variable in
the analyses: 2500 g, 2500 g. Medication use was defined as the
self-reported use of -agonists or inhaled steroids within the
month before the household interview. Asthma and chronic bron-
chitis required the self-report of a physician's diagnosis at any
time in the past. The number of self-reported episodes of wheez-
ing or whistling in the chest, cough, and upper respiratory infec-
tion (URI) during the past 12 months were categorized into two
groups: none to two, and three or more. Self-reported pneumonia
during the past 12 months was categorized as none, one or more,
because of its infrequent occurrence.
ETS Exposure
Reported ETS exposure was classified in two different ways:
current household exposure and maternal smoking at any time
during the pregnancy. Current household exposure was defined
as the total number of cigarettes smoked by household members
in the house per day. Smoking by visitors or guests was not asked.
Three categories were defined: none, 1 to 19 cigarettes smoked per
day, and 20 cigarettes smoked per day. Previous analyses from
NHANES III reported that household exposure was significantly
associated with serum cotinine levels and accounted for most of
the explained variance in the regression models among partici-
pants 4 years of age.8
It was not possible to identify the mother among the reported
smokers in the household. However, information was collected on
the biologic mother's smoking during pregnancy. Maternal smok-
ing during pregnancy was used as a surrogate for current mater-
nal smoking, because a high percent of women who smoking
during pregnancy continue smoking through at least the first 5
years of the child's life.9,10
Statistical Methods
All estimates were calculated using the sampling weights to
represent children 2 months through 5 years of age in the United
States. The sampling weights were created to adjust for unequal
probabilities of selection and adjusted to account for nonresponse
and poststratified to the US population as estimated by the Bureau
of the Census. Statistical analyses were performed using
SUDAAN,11 a program that adjusted for the complex sample
design when calculating variance estimates. All confidence inter-
vals shown are at the 95% level.
Modeling and Attributable Risk
The association between exposure and outcome was evaluated
by analyzing stratified two-way contingency tables, testing the
hypothesis of independence versus general association. Linear
contrasts were used to evaluate differences in outcome propor-
tions between groups exposed to ETS and those not exposed.
Logistic regression models were then developed to account for
other factors that might affect the association between ETS expo-
sure and each respiratory outcome. Separate models were devel-
oped for the age groups 2 months through 2 years, 3 years through
5 years, and 2 months through 5 years, which included main
effects other than exposure only when they or interactions be-
tween them were significant at P  .05.
Finally, the proportion of the prevalence of each outcome
among exposed groups that can be attributed to ETS was calcu-
lated from the logistic model parameters.12 The resulting propor-
tions were multiplied by the estimates of the exposed population
to obtain the number of excess cases attributable to ETS. Totals for
observations with missing values were distributed among the
categories in proportion to the distributions of outcome by expo-
sure for the sample of observations with complete information.
Response Rate of the Interview Sample
Among white, black, and Mexican-American children 2 months
through 5 years of age (N  8238) selected for the NHANES III
sample, 94.2% (n  7763) participated in the interview. Of those
participating in the interview, 98.9% (n  7680) had complete
information on ETS exposure. The nonresponse for all other vari-
ables used in the analyses within the group with complete data on
ETS exposure was 2.1%.
RESULTS
Exposure to ETS varied by the measure evaluated.
Based on current household exposure, 61.6% of the
children lived in homes with no smoke exposure,
whereas 23.9% lived in homes where 1 to 19 ciga-
rettes were smoked per day and 14.5% in homes
where 20 cigarettes were smoked per day. Smoking
during pregnancy was reported by 23.8% of the bi-
ologic mothers. Mexican-American children were ex-
posed to the lowest levels of ETS, whereas non-
Hispanic white children were exposed to the highest
levels. Little difference was seen by age or sex.
Among all children, diagnosed asthma, chronic
bronchitis, and three or more episodes of wheezing
increased with increased ETS exposure, regardless of
which measure of exposure was used (Table 1). For
household exposure, the effect was seen most con-

sistently when ETS exposure was 20 cigarettes per
day. Exposure to 20 cigarettes appeared to be pro-
tective for URI, whereas smoking during pregnancy
had no effect. The negative association of ETS with
URI disappeared after adjusting for breastfeeding,
day care, and race (data not shown). Pneumonia and
three or more episodes of cough showed no signifi-
cant association to ETS and were excluded from ad-
ditional analyses.
The effect of ETS varied by age (Table 2). When the
sample was divided into two age groups (children 2
months to 2 years of age and children 3 years to 5
years of age), ETS was associated with diagnosed
asthma, chronic bronchitis, and three or more epi-
sodes of wheezing in the younger age group. In the
older age group, only the association between ETS
and diagnosed asthma remained statistically signifi-
cant.
Logistic regression analyses were performed to
evaluate the role of potential confounders on the
relationship observed between ETS and respiratory
outcomes (Table 3). Models were created for the
all-ages group of children, for children 2 months to 2
years of age, and for children 3 years to 5 years age
groups separately, using both definitions of ETS ex-
posure. When ETS was defined as household expo-
sure, the strongest effect was seen consistently in the
2 months to 2 years age group among children living
in households where 20 cigarettes were smoked
per day, with the exception of diagnosed asthma, for
which the adjusted odds ratios were similar in the
younger and older age groups. Similar results were
seen when ETS was defined as smoking during preg-
nancy.
Additional analyses investigated whether expo-
sure to ETS increased the use of asthma medication
among children with asthma. Reported use within
the past month of prescription medications for
asthma (-agonists or inhaled steroids) was not dif-
ferent between those with asthma reporting ETS ex-
posure and those reporting none; percent of those
with asthma reporting use of medication by house-
hold exposure: none, 25.7%; 1 to 19 cigarettes
smoked per day, 32.9%; and 20 cigarettes smoked
per day, 23.1% (P  .4); percent of those with asthma
reporting use of medication by maternal smoking
during pregnancy: no, 28.9%; yes, 22.7% (P  .30).
Attributable Risk
The excess number of cases attributable to ETS
exposure after adjustment for the relevant confound-
ers was calculated. The findings were similar regard-
less of the measure of ETS. The attributable risks
ranged from 0.4 to 0.6 among children exposed to
ETS at age 2 months to 2 years (Fig 1); that is, among
children exposed, 40% to 60% of the cases of asthma,
chronic bronchitis, and three or more episodes of
wheezing were attributable to ETS exposure. For
diagnosed asthma among children 2 months through
5 years old, there were 133 800 to 161 600 excess
cases, whereas among children 2 months through 2
years old, there were 61 000 to 79 200 excess cases of

DISCUSSION
ETS exposure in the home is widespread among
US children 6 years of age (38%), and it plays an
important, independent role in the respiratory health
of children 2 years of age. The levels of exposure
reported here are lower than those from the 1988
Child Health Supplement (CHS) of the National
Health Interview Survey (NHIS), in which 42% of
children 5 years of age were currently living in a
household with a smoker.13 Part of the difference
may be attributable to the 1.2% decrease in smok-
ing levels between 1988 and 1992 among women
18 years of age in the United States.14
There is no ideal method to quantify a child's
exposure to ETS. Comparison of self-report with co-
tinine measures have found that both give equivalent
results when classifying children in regards to ETS
exposure.15­18 At the first well-child visit (6 to 8 weeks
of age), urine cotinine levels 10 g/L were found in
8% of nonsmoking homes, 44% in homes where
someone other than the mother smoked, 91% where
only the mother smoked vs 96% where the mother
and another household member smoked.19 The au-
thors concluded that a screening questionnaire about
household smoking was sufficient to define a group
of infants with urine cotinines 10 g/L. Previous
analyses on Phase I (1988 to 1990) of NHANES III
showed that among children 4 to 11 years of age,
serum cotinine levels were higher in children with
reported household exposure versus those with none
reported.8
Reported smoking during pregnancy has been
shown to be an excellent surrogate measure for cur-
rent maternal smoking during at least the first 5
years of life. A telephone follow-up study performed
on participants from the 1985 NHIS reported that
70% of women who quit smoking during any part of
their pregnancy resumed smoking within 1 year of
delivery, with 93% of those resuming in the first 6
months.10 Data from the 1970 Child Health and Ed-
ucation Study in the United Kingdom, a birth cohort
of all children born from April 5 to 11, 1970, found
that 90% of the women who smoked during preg-
nancy were still smoking when their child reached 5
years of age.9
The number of smokers in the house is highly
correlated with cotinine levels among children.20,21
However, maternal smoking has been shown to be
the chief source of ETS exposure for children in the
home.17,21 Maternal smoking behavior influences the
smoking behavior of others. In a study of 433 infants
at age 18 days, 75% of smoking mothers smoked near
their infant and the amount smoked near the infant
by the mother was correlated with the amount
smoked by others near the infant.22

Day care does not seem to be a significant source
of ETS exposure. Among English school children 5 to
7 years of age, only 8.7% of the children received
child care from a smoker, and in 66% of the cases, the
parent was also a smoker.21 Among children with
asthma 8 months through 13 years of age studied in
an allergy clinic, reported ETS exposure in day care
was not an important determinant of the child's co-
tinine level once household exposure was accounted
for.16 However in a nationwide study, day care has
been shown to be an important factor contributing to
the number of respiratory infections experienced by
children 6 weeks through 17 months of age.23
In addition to the potential misclassification with
respect to ETS exposure, a number of other issues
may influence the findings of this study. Self-report
was used to classify individuals in regards to their
respiratory problems. Misunderstanding of the ques-
tions or use of unfamiliar terms may have resulted in
nondifferential misclassification, which would tend
to obscure any underlying association. Conversely,
the effect of smoking on ETS may be attributable to
an overreporting of symptoms by parents who
smoke. Lebowitz and Burrows24 reported that the
association between ETS and smoking exposure was
no longer significant after controlling for the respi-
ratory symptoms of the parents. Other studies have
reported that the association of ETS on respiratory
symptoms is not eliminated when taking into ac-
count parental respiratory symptoms.5,25 Finally, ei-
ther the low prevalence of some of the respiratory
effects or a small true effect of ETS on a particular
respiratory outcome would reduced the power of
this study to detect any true difference between the
exposed and unexposed groups.
The NHANES III data add to the growing litera-
ture that with the exception of asthma, the respira-
tory effects of ETS are limited to the first few years of
life among children 5 years of age. The reported
incidence of pneumonia and bronchitis was influ-
enced by ETS only during the first year of life in a
birth cohort of 2200 children in England followed
to age 5 years.5 Maternal smoking was associated
with an increased rate of medical consultations for
bronchitispneumonia and maternal report of lower
respiratory symptoms only in the first 2 years of life
after adjustment for confounders in a birth cohort of
1100 children followed annually from birth to 6
years of age in the Christchurch, New Zealand Child
Development Study.6 Although pneumonia was not
statistically significantly related to ETS in the
NHANES III, even in the 0 to 2 years age group,
there appeared to be a tendency for pneumonia to
increase with increasing ETS exposure.
Similar results are seen from analyses of studies
focusing on active wheezing or wheezy bronchitis. In
a case­control study of children 2 months to 16 years
of age presenting to an emergency room with wheez-
ing, ETS exposure (salivary cotinine 10 ng/mL)
was found to be associated only with wheezing in
children 2 years of age.26 A case­control study of
children 4 months to 4 years of age hospitalized for
the first time for wheezy bronchitis reported that
parental smoking, especially maternal, was an im-
portant factor in children 18 months of age.18 Data
from the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey
showed that maternal smoking was significantly as-
sociated with asthma and wheezing combined only
in the 0 to 2 years age group but not in the 3 to 18
years age group.27
Only diagnosed asthma is associated with ETS
exposure during the first 5 years of life. Interestingly,
wheezing, the major symptom of asthma, was not
associated with ETS in the older group. Other studies
have reported previously that ETS exposure approx-
imately doubles the prevalence of asthma in chil-
dren.28,29 However, studies linking ETS to the inci-
dence of asthma have found conflicting results. In
Arizona, ETS exposure was associated only with the
development of asthma if the mother had 12 years
of education, but not among the children of more
highly educated women.30 In Canada, only children
with atopic dermatitis exposed to ETS developed
asthma, whereas others exposed to ETS did not de-
velop asthma31 and in New Zealand, ETS was not
associated with the development of asthma.32
The role of ETS exposure on asthma severity is
unclear. A previous report from the 1981 CHS of the
NHIS reported that ETS was associated with the
greater use of physician-prescribed asthma medica-
tion in the last 2 weeks,29 whereas no association was
seen in the NHANES III. The variation in defining
medication use may explain the differences. In the
1981 CHS, a parent had to report the use of any
medication prescribed by a physician for asthma.
This form of the question does not eliminate the
reporting of over-the-counter medications such as
decongestants or cough suppressants. The NHANES
III asked specifically about the name of the medica-
tion; the parent could either show the bottle or report
the name verbally. In our analyses, we looked spe-
cifically at -agonists and inhaled steroids, which are
specific therapies for asthma. It is also possible that a
sufficient number of sample persons whose asthma
was aggravated by ETS avoided exposure to ETS and
thus remove any association between ETS and sever-
ity in this cross-sectional study.
Studies using other measures of severity have re-
ported conflicting results. Lower pulmonary func-
tions and more reported acute exacerbations were
found with ETS exposure among patients with
asthma attending an allergy clinic.16 Among low-
income urban children with asthma in New York
City (average age, 9 years), passive smoking was
associated with emergency room visits for asthma,
but not with hospitalizations or abnormalities in pul-
monary function.33 The effects of ETS on severity of
asthma varied with age among patients evaluated at
a Canadian allergy clinic. In the youngest group (1 to
6 years of age), no significant effect was found with
exposure to smoke; in the middle age group (7 to 11
years of age), the children of smokers had an increase
in their asthma score; and in the oldest group (12 to
17 years of age), the asthma symptom score was
increased and the pulmonary functions were de-
creased in the children exposed to smoke.34 In a
recent report on 22 children (mean age, 5 years)
followed for 1 month after being hospitalized for
http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/101/2/e8 5 of 6
asthma, children living with a smoker reported 1.9
fewer days of daytime symptoms than those not
living with a smoker (P  .05); however, no statisti-
cally significant difference was found in the mean
number of nighttime symptoms.35 Other studies re-
porting changes in ETS exposure did not find an
association with acute attacks of asthma.36,37
A previous study used a national dataset to esti-
mate the number of excess cases of disease from ETS.
Approximately 38 000 excess cases of asthma and
wheezing in children 18 years of age were reported
from the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Sur-
vey.27 This probably is an overestimate because ETS
was statistically significantly associated with ETS ex-
posure only in children 0 to 2 years of age. However,
the nonsignificant association in the older age group
was included in their calculation.27 Our findings in-
dicate 13 400 to 16 200 excess cases of asthma
among children 2 months through 5 years old.
Among children 2 months through 2 years old, there
were 61 000 to 79 000 excess cases of chronic bron-
chitis and 127 000 to 172 000 cases of three or more
episodes of wheezing.
SUMMARY
ETS exposure is common among children in the
United States. The reported prevalence of asthma,
wheezing, and chronic bronchitis was increased with
ETS exposures. No statistically significant increase in
the prevalence of URI, pneumonia, or cough was
associated with ETS exposure. The exposure has little
effect on the respiratory health of children 3 years
through 5 years of age with the exception of asthma.
ETS appears to increase the prevalence of asthma
rather than the severity, as measured by medication
use. These findings reinforce the need to reduce the
exposure of young children to ETS.
