Access And Affordability: An
Update On Health Reform In
Massachusetts, Fall 2008
Access, affordability, and coverage have improved since 2006, but
rising health costs have eroded some gains in affordability of care.
by Sharon K. Long and Paul B. Masi
ABSTRACT: Massachusetts continues to move forward on comprehensive health reform.
Uninsurance is at historically low levels, despite the recent economic downturn. Building on
that coverage expansion, access to and affordability of care in the commonwealth have im-
proved. Notwithstanding these successes, some of the early gains in reducing barriers to
care and improving the affordability of care had eroded by fall 2008, reflecting trends that
predate health reform in Massachusetts: constraints on provider capacity and increasing
health care costs. Because these are national concerns as well, Massachusetts continues
to offer lessons for national reform efforts. [Health Affairs 28, no. 4 (2009): w578­w587
(published online 28 May 2009; 10.1377/hlthaff.28.4.w578)]
Health reform remains a top priority on the national agenda,
with many proposals drawing on Massachusetts' 2006 health reform leg-
islation. That initiative, with its goals of near-universal health insurance
coverage and improved access to affordable, high-quality health care, includes
shared individual, employer, and government responsibilities. Key elements in-
clude Medicaid expansions (called MassHealth), subsidized private insurance
coverage (called Commonwealth Care, or CommCare), a new purchasing pool
(called Commonwealth Choice, or CommChoice), required actions for employers,
and an individual mandate.1 By summer 2008 the uninsurance rate among all resi-
dents in Massachusetts was estimated to be down to 2.6 percent.2
Although much is known about the initial impacts of reform in Massachusetts,
the initiative continues to evolve.3 Some key components have been put in place
only recently, and others have been modified over time.4 Drawing lessons from
Massachusetts' experiences requires examining its reform initiative over time.
This paper provides an update as of fall 2008 on health reform in Massachusetts
as it affected working-age adults--the primary target population of the reform

initiative. The high levels of insurance coverage in the state have been documented
elsewhere.5 The focus here is on the impacts of health reform on access to and
affordability of care for residents of the state.
Study Data And Methods
n Data. The study used three rounds of interviews with adults ages 18­64, con-
ducted in fall 2006 (N = 3,010), just prior to the implementation of many of the key
elements of reform; fall 2007 (N = 2,938); and fall 2008 (N = 4,041). The surveys, de-
scribed elsewhere, collected information on insurance status, access to care, out-of-
pocket health spending, medical debt, and more general financial problems.6
n Methods. Determining the effect of health reform in Massachusetts requires
comparing the outcomes under reform (for example, access to care) to the outcomes
that would have occurred in the absence of reform. This study compares the out-
comes for a cross-sectional sample of adults in periods following the implementa-
tion of health reform (fall 2007 and 2008) to the outcomes for a similar cross-
sectional sample of adults in fall 2006.7 Under this pre-post framework, differences
between the pre- and post-implementation periods are attributed to the state's re-
form efforts. An important limitation of this model is that other changes over the
time period that also affected the outcomes of interest will be captured in the
estimates, confounding the estimates of the reform's impacts.
An analysis using national data for 2006 and 2007 from the Current Population
Survey (CPS) found that earlier pre-post estimates of the impacts of health reform
were not affected by such confounding factors.8 However, economic trends may be
more of an issue here, because the Massachusetts economy had slowed by fall
2008: the share of working-age adults employed in October (the first month of the
field period for the surveys) was 64.0 percent in 2006, 63.7 percent in 2007, and
62.6 percent in 2008.9 Thus, the estimates reported here likely reflect the effects of
both health reform and the early phase of the recent economic downturn.10 Unfor-
tunately, the analyses needed to disentangle the effects of health reform from those
of the recession require data that will not be available until late 2009 and 2010.
An economic downturn would be expected to lead to a drop in health insurance
coverage (as unemployment increased and people lost employer-sponsored cover-
age) and, as a result, poorer access to health care, all else equal.11 In fall 2008 there
was no evidence of a decline in insurance coverage in the state. Thus, any early ef-
fects of the recession were not large enough to offset the gains in coverage that had
been achieved under health reform.
We report estimates based on multivariate regression models that control for
characteristics of individuals and their family members and for characteristics of
the local health care market and economy in each year. The analysis sample was
limited to observations with complete data for the regression models; 3.1 percent
of the cases were dropped because of missing data for one or more explanatory
variables. Because the outcome measures we examined were binary variables (for

example, any doctor visit), probit regression models were estimated, controlling
for the complex design of the sample using the survey estimation procedures (svy)
in Stata 10. In presenting findings, we report the regression-adjusted impact esti-
mates in the text (these estimates are different from simple differences calculated
by subtraction); both unadjusted estimates (simple differences) and regression-
adjusted estimates are reported in appendix exhibits online.12
Study Findings
n Access to and use of health care. Consistent with the sustained increase in
coverage in Massachusetts, there also have been sustained improvements in access
to care (Exhibit 1).13 Under health reform, working-age adults (ages 18­64) in Mas-
sachusetts were more likely than before to report that they had a usual place to go
when sick or in need of advice about their health, a measure of continuity of health
care (up 5.0 percentage points between fall 2006 and fall 2008 [these are regression-
adjusted estimates; see Appendix Exhibit 1]). They were also more likely than before
to have had doctor visits in the past twelve months: the likelihood of having any doc-
tor visit rose 5.7 percentage points and multiple doctor visits, 5.1 percentage points.
Similarly, the likelihood of having a preventive care visit (up 6.5 percentage points)
and a dental care visit (up 7.8 percentage points) rose by fall 2008.
Although there were gains in health care use in the first year (between fall 2006
and fall 2007), many of the gains in doctor visits occurred in the second year (be-
tween fall 2007 and fall 2008), when people were more likely to have continuous
insurance coverage. During the second period, there were significant increases in
the likelihood of any doctor visit in the past twelve months (up 4.6 percentage
points) and multiple doctor visits (up 6.5 percentage points).
The gains in access under health reform were strongest for lower-income adults
(those with family incomes less than 300 percent of the federal poverty level);
however, higher-income adults were also more likely to report doctor visits in the
past twelve months (up 5.3 percentage points) and visits for preventive care (up
5.2 percentage points) in fall 2008 than in fall 2006 (data not shown).
These estimates are for all adults in Massachusetts, not just those who gained
coverage under health reform. Although we would expect most of the gains in ac-
cess to have been among those who obtained coverage, gains in access were also
reported by those who were continuously insured during the year, which suggests
that the improvements in access to care reflect both gains from having coverage
and improvements in existing insurance coverage under health reform (data not
shown). Further, the improvements in existing coverage affected both those with
public coverage (who reported gains in dental care use--consistent with the ex-
pansion of dental coverage under MassHealth) and those with private coverage
(who reported gains in the use of preventive care--consistent with the require-
ment that preventive care visits be covered without a deductible under the "mini-
mum creditable coverage" standards; data not shown).

n Barriers to care. Paradoxically, the increases in health care use from fall 2007
to fall 2008 were coupled with indications that some adults were having more diffi-
culty obtaining care in fall 2008 than in fall 2007. The shares of adults who reported
that they did not get care that they thought they needed in the past twelve months
tended to increase between fall 2007 and fall 2008, after having declined between
fall 2006 and fall 2007 (Exhibit 1).14 Although those increases were statistically sig-
nificant for only a few types of care (specialist care and medical tests, treatment, or

follow-up care), they were large enough to offset some of the earlier reductions un-
der health reform. By fall 2008, the reductions in unmet need under health reform
were limited to lower levels of unmet need for doctor care, preventive care screening,
and prescription drugs; unmet need for other care had moved closer to pre-reform
levels.
The increased demand for care between fall 2007 and fall 2008 (as indicated by
the simultaneous increases in use and unmet need for some types of care) may re-
flect several factors, including attempts by newly insured adults to obtain care for
the first time, attempts by adults with newly covered benefits to access those ben-
efits, and, as a result of both of those factors, increased demand for follow-up care
based on initial visits. To the extent that these factors are driving the increased de-
mand, there would be greater stress on the supply of providers in the early period
under health reform, as more people sought and used health care in a short period
of time. However, under a system in which people have continuous coverage (as is
more likely in Massachusetts under health reform), we would expect ongoing de-
mand for care to stabilize between the lower levels of the pre-reform period and
the higher levels of this transition period.
To better understand barriers to care in Massachusetts in fall 2008, the 2008
survey asked about problems trying to obtain health care during the past twelve
months (Exhibit 2). About one in five adults in Massachusetts reported that they
were told that a doctor's office or clinic was not accepting patients with their type
of coverage or was not accepting any new patients. These problems were reported
for both primary and specialty care (67 percent and 43 percent of those reporting
such problems, respectively; data not shown).
Difficulties finding a provider were much more common for lower-income than
higher-income adults (29 percent/15 percent) and for adults with public and other

coverage than those with private coverage (32 percent/16 percent). Adults with
public and other coverage were much more likely than those with private coverage
to be told that the provider was not taking their type of insurance (25 percent/7
percent) and to face closed panels (24 percent/12 percent).
These differences likely reflect multiple factors, including lower provider reim-
bursement rates under the public programs and access to a limited set of providers
under the four health plans that were serving public enrollees during this period.
The constraints imposed by the latter were likely exacerbated by the rapid in-
crease in coverage under health reform in 2007, which was largely concentrated
within public programs and, therefore, within the networks of the four plans.
Reported problems finding a provider in fall 2008 varied across the state, with
more problems reported in the west (29 percent) and southeast (23 percent) re-
gions, as compared to the Boston (20 percent), central (21 percent), metro west (17
percent), and northeast (16 percent) regions.15 Reported difficulties finding a pro-
vider tended to be more common in areas with lower provider supply, especially in
areas located farther from Boston, with its concentration of providers.16
Consistent with the reported difficulties in obtaining community-based care,
we saw no change from pre-reform levels in emergency department (ED) use for
nonemergency conditions (that is, conditions that the respondent felt could have
been treated in the community if a provider had been available; Exhibit 1). Such
use remained as high in fall 2008 as it was in fall 2006, at 15 percent for all adults
and 22 percent for lower-income adults.17 Thus, the changes to date under health
reform have not translated into reductions in ED use for nonemergency condi-
tions. When asked the reasons for ED visits for nonemergencies in fall 2008, 55.8
percent of adults reported going because they were unable to get an appointment
as soon as one was needed (data not shown).
n Financial burden of health care. In the first year under health reform, the fi-
nancial burden of health care on individuals dropped significantly, particularly for
lower-income adults. By fall 2008, however, some of those gains in affordability had
eroded: the shares reporting problems paying medical bills and problems with med-
ical debt they were paying off over time moved back toward the fall 2006 levels for
all adults and for lower-income adults (Exhibit 3).18 Furthermore, there were no lon-
ger reductions in the shares of adults overall who were spending high shares of fam-
ily income out of pocket for health care between fall 2006 and fall 2008.19 Among
lower-income adults, the decline in the share spending 5 percent or more of family
income out of pocket continued through fall 2008 (down five percentage points
from fall 2006 [these are regression-adjusted estimates; see Appendix Exhibit 3]),
but the share with out-of-pocket spending of 10 percent or more of family income in
fall 2008 was no longer significantly different from the fall 2006 level.
Consistent with the evidence of some increases in the burden of health care
costs in Massachusetts between fall 2007 and fall 2008, there were also some in-
creases in unmet need for care because of costs over that period. In particular, un-

met need for specialist care and for medical tests, treatment, or follow-up care rec-
ommended by a doctor were significantly higher in fall 2008 than in fall 2007 for
all adults. The net result is that although unmet need because of costs remains rel-
atively low in the state, some of the reductions under health reform in fall 2006
had been offset by increases between fall 2007 and fall 2008.
Discussion
Roughly two years after Massachusetts began implementing its ambitious
health reform initiative, there are sustained signs of success. Uninsurance is at his-
torically low levels, and there have been widespread improvements in access to
health care for working-age adults. Those adults are more likely to have a usual

source of care and to have had doctor visits, preventive care visits, and dental care
visits under health reform than before. These gains in access reflect both increases
in insurance coverage and improvements in the coverage that is available.
There have also been gains in the affordability of health care for adults in Massa-
chusetts under health reform. However, unlike the sustained gains in insurance
coverage and access, some of the early gains in the affordability of health care had
eroded by fall 2008, as health care costs continued to increase--as they have in the
nation as a whole--potentially jeopardizing the gains under health reform.
In August 2008 Gov. Deval Patrick signed into law An Act to Promote Cost
Containment, Transparency, and Efficiency in the Delivery of Quality Health Care,
which seeks to contain health care costs as well as to improve access to and qual-
ity of care.20 The current proposal being developed would undertake fundamental
reform of the health care payment system, moving away from fee-for-service to a
global payment system that emphasizes care coordination and collaboration.
The proposed systematic change in the payment system in Massachusetts, by
emphasizing coordination of care, offers the potential for addressing problems
with access to care and inefficiency in care delivery in Massachusetts, both of
which predate health reform. In this study we found that adults in Massachusetts,
although more likely to have health care visits under health reform than before, re-
ported difficulty finding providers who would see them and difficulty obtaining
timely appointments for care. Problems obtaining care occurred across all income
levels but were concentrated among lower-income adults, particularly those en-
rolled in public programs. These findings are consistent with an ongoing survey of
physicians in Massachusetts that found the shares of internists accepting new pa-
tients and MassHealth patients dropped under health reform, while wait times for
appointments increased.21 Similarly, some community health centers reported lon-
ger waits for appointments under health reform.22
Difficulty obtaining care in the community was reported to be an important
factor in the use of ED care for nonemergency conditions in Massachusetts in fall
2008. Such use has not increased under health reform, but the high levels suggest
that inefficiency persists in the care delivery system. Addressing such use,
whether through payment reform or other measures, should translate into im-
provements in the quality of care for individuals and cost savings for individuals,
health plans, and state programs.
n Limitations of the study. This study provides interim estimates of the im-
pacts of health reform in Massachusetts. Most notably, these estimates are for the
time period before the larger penalty for not complying with the individual mandate
went into effect, before small businesses gained access to CommChoice, and before
the "minimum creditable coverage" standards for insurance coverage went into ef-
fect. The estimates also predate any efforts at reforming health care payments,
which is essential for the long-run sustainability of health reform.
Further, as noted above, the study design assigned all changes over time to the

impacts of health reform. Separating the effects of health reform from those of the
recession requires making use of data from national sources that will not be avail-
able until late 2009 and 2010. However, the data available now suggest that the ef-
fects of the recession were relatively limited in Massachusetts in fall 2008.
Finally, we relied on survey data, which are subject to several types of error
(coverage error, sampling error, measurement error, and nonresponse error).
n Lessons for national reform. Two key lessons can be drawn from the most re-
cent year of health reform in Massachusetts. First, although major expansions in
coverage can be achieved without addressing health care costs, cost pressures have
the potential to undermine the gains under reform. With its current focus on health
care costs, Massachusetts once again looks to be at the forefront of developing inno-
vative strategies that will provide guidance to national reform efforts.
Second, in preparing for health reform at the national level, it will be important
to ensure that the care delivery systems in communities across the country are
ready to support the planned expansion in coverage. As was true in Massachu-
setts, it is likely that existing constraints on provider supply across the country
would be exacerbated by an influx of newly insured people. There will no doubt
be much debate as to whether this means increasing the supply of physicians, as
some argue, or more fundamental changes in the health care system that address
the organization and delivery of health care, as others contend.23

4. Most notably, the penalty for failing to comply with the individual mandate was implemented in 2008
based on coverage as of 31 December 2007. The penalty in 2008 was relatively small, and a larger penalty in
2009 was based on coverage for all of 2008. Components modified over time include increases in premi-
ums and cost sharing under CommCare and CommChoice, along with increases in the "affordability
schedule" that determines the amount an individual is expected to be able to pay for health insurance un-
der the individual mandate. Further, as was true in the rest of the country, health care costs and health in-
surance premiums in Massachusetts continued to increase during the 2007­2008 period.

7. The fall 2006 survey was fielded as the CommCare program was beginning for adults with family incomes
under 100 percent of poverty; however, enrollment started slowly.

employment Data," http://lmi2.detma.org/Lmi/lmi_lur_a.asp (accessed 6 April 2009). The Federal Re-
serve's "Beige Book," which provides an assessment of local economic conditions, also reports that the
state's economy had slowed by the end of 2008. See Federal Reserve Board, "Summary of Commentary on

10. As in the U.S. as a whole, the impact of the recession in Massachusetts was felt most strongly after 2008.
11. Although some would obtain other coverage (for example, coverage through a spouse or public coverage),
others would become uninsured.
12. Appendix tables are available at http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.28.4.w578/DC2.
13. Exhibit 1 shows the rates for each year based on the survey. Appendix Exhibit 1 (online; ibid.) provides un-
adjusted impact estimates (simple differences) and regression-adjusted impact estimates. All differences
reported in thetext areregression-adjusted estimatesand thusdifferslightlyfromthefiguresin Exhibit 1.
14. This is care that the individual thought he or she needed. It might or might not be medically necessary.
15. For a map, see online Appendix Exhibit 2, as in Note 12. The comparison controls for differences in age,
gender, and health and disability status across the regions.
16. The number of primary care physicians per 100,000 people ranged from 60 in the southeast to 251 in the
Boston region in 2006, with the average for U.S. counties at 81 (86 in metropolitan counties and 53 in
nonmetropolitan counties). Data from the 2007 Area Resource File, Health Resources and Services
Administration.
17. High levels of emergency department use overall and for nonemergency conditions are not unique to Mas-
sachusetts. See S.R. Pitts et al., "National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey: 2006 Emergency De-
partment Summary," National Health Statistics Report no. 7, 6 August 2008, http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
data/nhsr/nhsr007.pdf (accessed 12 May 2009)
18. Exhibit 3 shows the rates for each year based on the survey. Appendix Exhibit 3 provides the unadjusted
and regression-adjusted impact estimates. The reported changes in the affordability of health care may
capture both actual changes and changes in consumers' perceptions of their economic circumstances in an
economic downturn. However, the finding that there were no changes in the share of adults reporting
problems paying other (non­health care) bills suggests that the increased problems with medical costs are
not due to changes in perceptions. Appendix Exhibit 3 is available online as in Note 12.
19. Because of the way data on family income are collected in the survey, the measure of out-of-pocket health
care costs relative to family income cannot be constructed for adults with family incomes of 500 percent of
poverty or more.
