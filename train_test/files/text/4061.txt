Aesthetic objects on
display: the objectification of
fashion models as a situated
practice

Abstract
This article unravels the process of objectification by empirically examining a social context
where it occurs almost incessantly: fashion modeling. Drawing on an ethnography of
fashion modeling in Amsterdam, Paris and Warsaw, I argue that objectification is neither
ubiquitous nor one-dimensional: it takes place in specific social contexts and unfolds itself
differently under different social conditions. Moreover, objectification is not unidirectional:
it is done by and happens to both men and women. By taking an experiential perspective
which involves models' subjective responses to being objectified, I call into question
theoretical arguments of objectification pertaining to disempowered subjects, and the
assumption that objectification is inherently negative or immoral. Instead, I argue that
objectification is socially rooted in institutions and specific situations and that this matters
considerably for its varying forms, levels of intensity and the emotional and practical
responses it evokes in people. This does not imply that objectification is less compelling
as a process, or easy to avoid. Objectification might be all the more effective exactly
because the process is embedded in different social contexts, and adapts itself accordingly.

They don't have to be very skinny, just straight, without very pronounced forms.
(Lucy, Amsterdam fashion designer)
Visible and mobile, my body is a thing among things; it's caught in the fabric of the
world, and its cohesion is that of a thing. But, because it moves itself and sees, it holds
things in a circle around itself. (Merleau-Ponty, 1964: 163)
Amsterdam fashion designer Lucy objectifies the models she works with, describing
them as `things among things': bodies, coat racks, pieces of earth to showcase her
designs, the products of her individual, creative subjectivity. This article unravels
this process of objectification by empirically examining a social context in which it
is almost incessant: fashion modeling. I argue that just as there are many ways in
which people can be used or seen as things, objectification is a multifaceted process,
experienced in a wide range of ways. Unlike in early feminist literature, in this
article I suggest that objectification is not necessarily a bad thing: models working
for Lucy may enjoy their work, may even be proud of being `a coat rack'.
Objectification has been studied extensively in (social) psychological, socio-
logical and feminist studies. In the latter, it is often interpreted as resulting from
an (internalised) male gaze (Mulvey, 1975; Chapkis, 1986; Bordo, 1993;
Fredrickson and Roberts, 1997) and has frequently been conflated with sexual
objectification: women are reduced to sexual instruments to be used or looked at
by others, predominantly men (Coy, 2009). In early feminist theory, objectification
was attacked as harmful and immoral because of its dehumanising effects
(Dworkin, 1981; MacKinnon, 1987). Contemporary feminists like Gill (2003,
2007) and McRobbie (2008) continue this, interpreting women's positive accounts
of objectifying experiences as misguided, even as examples of false consciousness.
For them, celebratory accounts of being looked at or sexualised are instances of
internalised misogyny (Cahill, 2012: x), or caused by consumerist ideology.
While all these studies tend to reduce objectification to a common, generalisable,
negative phenomenon, philosopher Ann Cahill argues that rather than seeing them
as an a priori negative event, detrimental to the self, objectifying experiences are
better understood `as often crucial elements to a flourishing sense of self' (2012: x).
I follow this line of thought in an empirical analysis of objectification.
Acknowledging that objectification is an integrated aspect of social interaction
enables an empirical interrogation of the idea of objectification as `good or bad'.
I also look at how fashion models subjectively experience objectification
(cf. Mahmood, 2001), and in doing so I draw on Martha Nussbaum (1995), who
unpacks the notion of objectification into at least seven distinct forms to explore
objectification in situated, institutionalised practice.
Building on Mears's (2011) ethnographic work on the creation and valuation of
`looks' in fashion modeling, I further argue that modeling is an extreme case, a field
where objectification happens almost continuously. However, there are different
forms and levels of intensity under different conditions: objectification may entail
models being treated as only a body, unacknowledged as persons; being highly
2 Feminist Theory 0(0)
replaceable; or not being seen or heard at all. My analysis shows that, in many
cases, while being objectified is not an enjoyable experience, it is not fundamentally
bad, and more `active' forms can be experienced as empowering, potentially pro-
ductive to the self.
Drawing on an ethnography of fashion modeling in Amsterdam, Paris and
Warsaw, I demonstrate that objectification is neither ubiquitous nor one-dimen-
sional, but rather takes place in specific social contexts, unfolding differently under
different conditions. I argue that instead of being unidirectional, objectification is
done by, and happens to, both men and women. At the same time, female models
often face different kinds of objectification simultaneously and experience it as
more challenging. Thus, rather than the practice of objectification, it is the sub-
jective experience of it that is gendered.
Considering how being objectified is subjectively experienced leads to a theor-
etical exploration of what it means to be objectified. Although fashion modeling is
often associated with oppression and victimisation, in society modeling is a high-
status profession and, more importantly, models do not see themselves as victims.
Here an experiential angle enables a move beyond theoretical discussions about
power and agency.
Theories of objectification
Objectification has been theorised by feminist scholars who have engaged with
displays of, and gazes upon, women in particular (cf. Mulvey, 1975; Rubin,
1975; Dworkin, 1981; Chapkis, 1986; MacKinnon, 1987; Bartky, 1990; Bordo,
1993; Van Zoonen, 1994). This article responds to several controversies arising
from these by integrating insights from Nussbaum's (1995), Butler's (1997),
Cahill's (2012) and Mahmood's (2001) analyses of objectification, subjectivation
and subjectivity to enable new questions about objectification as a socially situated
practice. I relate objectification to three issues: first, the subjective experience
of objectification; second, its genderedness; and third, its multifaceted and
situated nature.
According to Cahill, feminist thinkers have paid little attention to objectification
by means of direct, empirical analysis (2012: 1), often employing the concept with-
out explicit or detailed articulation of its meanings. In fact, most research and
theorising broadly defines objectification as a negative event, emphasising its
de-humanising effects. For Fredrickson and Roberts, objectification is `the experi-
ence of being treated as a body, valued predominantly for its use to ­ or consump-
tion by ­ others' (1997: 174). Similarly, Bartky states that it occurs when `a body is
separated from a person, reduced to the status of instrument or commodity, or
regarded as if it is capable of representing the entire person' (1990, cited in
Fredrickson and Roberts, 1997: 175). Dworkin (1981) and MacKinnon (1987)
argue that instrumentalisation undermines individuals' ability to decide what is
valuable and to find ways to realise and promote this value, leading to the reduc-
tion of individuals to the status of things without autonomy or subjectivity, that
Holla 3
exist solely to be used, and possibly violated and abused, by others. This denial
of humanity makes objectification immoral (Papadaki, 2010: 17, 21. For more
agentic depictions of women on display, see: Rubin, 1975; Chapkis, 1986;
and Mears, 2011). Other accounts, usually from (social) psychology, repeatedly
demonstrate how objectification has negative psychological outcomes, including,
but not limited to, disordered eating and low self-esteem (Noll and Fredrickson,
1998; Muehlenkamp and Saris-Baglama, 2002). Some scholars, however,
have found people finding pleasure in being objectified, as, for example, when
it occurs in appreciative or sexually arousing ways (such as Strossen, 1995;
Mears, 2011).
Much of this work makes a strong case for objectification as disempowering and
highly unfavourable. However, from Cahill's perspective, being perceived and trea-
ted as an object is inevitable, precisely because the human self is embodied. Our
subjectivity is material: we are body-subjects and -objects. Feona Attwood notes
that the exposure of the body ­ male and female ­ has become so central to forms
of popular representation and individual self-expression (2010: 2) that presenting
oneself as an object, and being perceived as one, has become inescapable. Cahill
also argues that the experience of being an object, a bodily being whose material
appearance arouses the (for example sexual) interest of another, is potentially
enhancing to one's sense of self (2012: x). Building on these, this article considers
the possibility that being (seen as) an aesthetic object with aesthetic meaning might
contribute to feelings of self-worth, legitimacy and acknowledgement. By consider-
ing models' subjective responses, whether negative or positive, objectification
becomes an empirical question. Some theorists of postfeminism reject this, arguing
that objectification today also involves tricking women into accepting or even
celebrating their own objectified status. According to Gill, objectification today
is disguised as sexual subjectification (2003: 5), giving a (false) sense of being
`knowing, active and desiring' while actually marking a shift from `an external
male judging gaze to a self-policing narcissistic gaze' (Gill, 2003: 104, cited in
Attwood, 2010: 2). McRobbie too argues that new forms of constraints and regu-
lation of popular and consumer culture are concealed under a `quasi-feminist
vocabulary' that uncritically celebrates the proliferation of female `freedoms'
(2008: 548). However, this perspective denies the (female) subject agency and
excludes the subject's voice (Duits and Van Zoonen, 2006: 114). The claim that
women are deceived into believing that they have individually and freely chosen
their own situation ­ by patriarchy, neoliberal ideology or, as McRobbie sees it, by
a `quasi-feminist' discourse ­ is a claim to `know better than the subject', rendering
women unconscious of their own oppression.
Following Mahmood (2001: 225), I believe that empirically studying subject-
ive experience is especially important when these practices are precipitately con-
sidered objectionable from an outsider perspective. This is generally true for
fashion models, who are easily depicted by outsiders as subordinate to a restraining
beauty system. Their job may be hard, but as high-status individuals and holders of
aesthetic capital, they may not experience their work as merely oppressive.

Models' emotive reactions are fundamental to how they practically respond to
objectification. Possibilities for dealing with objectification are enabled and created
by institutional and situational contexts. In Butlerian (1997) terms, while object-
ification entails a power relation that may dominate the subject, it also forms the
conditions for dealing with it. Interpreting Butler, Mahmood argues that agency is
more than a synonym for resistance: it is the capacity to resist, endure, suffer and
persist (2001: 217). Again, whether objectification is met with resistance, cooper-
ation, escape or indifference is a matter for empirical investigation. This analysis
therefore starts from how objectification occurs in relation to both the emotive and
practical responses of fashion models.
The second debate addressed here is objectification's relationship with gender.
Objectification is generally associated with femininity, and authors like Mulvey
(1975), Dworkin (1981), Chapkis (1986), MacKinnon (1987) and Bordo (1993)
have argued that the objectified position is mainly held by women, because in
patriarchal societies men have the power to subjectively watch and define (cf.
Papadaki, 2010: 19). Objectification is thus gendered and unidirectional, happening
to women and done predominantly by men, and, when done by women, a conse-
quence of internalising the male gaze. Consequently, (social) psychological research
tends to focus on how female objectification comes about in mass media, and how
it affects women's self-perceptions (Fredrickson and Roberts, 1997; Harper and
Tiggemann, 2008). Feona Attwood critiques this, arguing that explaining bodily
display merely as an index of male sexual fantasy or female discomfort is simplistic.
In fashion modeling, an industry dominated by women, men can also become
objectified and women can be the objectifiers. Since who objectifies whom and
how should be empirically investigated (Attwood, 2010: 2), this article considers
both female and male models.
The third debate concerns multiplicity. Objectification is frequently depicted as a
one-dimensional process, entailing being reduced to only a body, or, in the case of
women, to a mere sexual body. While various, mainly feminist, scholars have
demonstrated how objectification coincides with sexualisation of female subjects
(Gill, 2007; Coy, 2009), other studies emphasise its multiple dimensions. Van der
Laan (2015), for instance, shows how visual objectification occurs in multiple,
distinctive forms, of which sexual objectification is but one. She also identifies
`decorative' and `disengaged' objectification, which relates to a model's aesthetic/
decorative function ­ their `thingness' and lack of personhood ­ much more than to
their being a sexual object (Van der Laan, 2015: 163, 166­167). Following this, this
article asks whether objectification in practice has multiple dimensions, and how
these take form under different social conditions. I draw on Nussbaum's (1995)
work on objectification in literature, and her seven forms: instrumentality, where
the object is a tool; denial of autonomy, where the object is treated as lacking in
autonomy and self-determination; inertness, where the object is treated as lacking
in agency, and perhaps also in activity; fungibility, where the objectified is treated
as interchangeable with other objects of the same type or of other types; violability,
where the objectiEer treats the object as lacking in boundary integrity, as
Holla 5
permissible to break up, smash and break into; ownership, where the object is
treated as something owned by someone else, to be bought or sold; and denial
of subjectivity, where the objectified is something whose experiences and feelings
are irrelevant. In cases of one or more of these seven ways, which can overlap and
co-occur, Nussbaum argues that we can speak of objectification (1995: 258).
Nussbaum's idea is a useful starting point. Since different conditions and
forms of objectification might arouse different subjective ­ practical and emotional
­ responses, acknowledging the diverse forms allows exploration of the
possibilities for various subjective experiences of, and practical engagements
with, objectification.
The field of fashion modeling: an extreme case of
objectification
In contemporary Western societies, increasingly focused on appearance and aes-
thetics, fashion models have become prominent cultural icons as symbolic carriers
of beauty ideals (Brenner and Cunningham, 1992; Mears, 2011), while being sim-
ultaneously critiqued. Popular news media, for instance, attribute both positive
and negative characteristics, describing models both as beautiful, glamorous and
natural, and also as artificial, effortless, obsessed, unhealthy or superficial. Within
modeling itself, models are rarely seen as `icons of ideal beauty' but predominantly
as physical surfaces to be showcased and improved, subjected to the scrutinising,
critical gazes of surrounding professionals. Agencies measure models' hips, waists
and chests, and only after the beauty standards have been met and a successful
`look' has been created are the models given praise and admiration. However,
whether the appreciation is positive or negative, inside or outside the field,
models ultimately fulfill a primary role of `aesthetic objects on display', to the
world and to professionals around them.
The model's job is, in essence, to be looked at. They enter and exit various
situations in which they are objectified and objectify themselves: castings, agency
visits, on sets before cameras, on runways, at home in front of the mirror. They are,
however, not objectified to the same degree in all situations, nor all of the time.
Models are selected on the basis of the industry's aesthetic conventions of white-
ness, slenderness, height and youthfulness, their bodies purposefully disciplined
and monitored. They preserve their object status through aesthetic labour
(Entwistle and Wissinger, 2006), involving diverse practices, from invasive `body
technologies' (Wesely, 2003) like plastic surgery or dietary hormonal therapy, to
more quotidian body practices like shaving, `watching your food', sleeping enough,
drinking water and exercising (Holla, 2016). The aesthetic goals are set by profes-
sionals other than the models: fashion designers, agents (`bookers'), photographers,
stylists and fashion clients. While the structure of the field and the profession
makes models prone to objectification, the asymmetrical power relations are sub-
jectively experienced in different ways, with situational dynamics playing an
important role. The subjective experience depends on how and where the
6 Feminist Theory 0(0)
objectification happens, and by whom: backstage by other professionals; front-
stage by wider, more or less informed audiences; or at home, where models are
their own critical observers.
The empirical context of fashion modeling is a strategic case to understand
objectification in practice as it is a central activity in the field: objectifying
images, objectifying professionals and (self-) objectified fashion models simultan-
eously produce each other (cf. Mears, 2011). Drawing on the experiences of male
and female models, this article unpacks objectification, asking how it is institution-
ally and situationally entrenched, and how is it subjectively experienced.
An ethnography of experience and practice
This study uses in-depth interviewing and participant observation. Between March
2011 and March 2013, I interviewed thirty-six models in Amsterdam, Paris and
Warsaw, cities in the transnational field of fashion modeling. I also spoke to fash-
ion photographers, bookers, fashion designers, magazine editors, stylists, make-up
artists and a fashion modeling coach. Most informants were recruited during fash-
ion events, with some recruiting further informants from their social networks. This
chain-referral sampling allowed insights into the social network connecting these
actors and provided access to people who might otherwise have been unreachable.
In terms of selection, as far as possible I paid attention to factors likely to influence
informants' practices and experiences, such as gender, age, ethnicity, nationality,
city and position in the field (commercial or high-end). However, as variation in
fashion models is limited by conventions of gender, class, age and ethnicity, the
informants consisted mainly of young, tall, slim, mostly white fashion models, most
of whom were female (twenty-two, or 61 per cent). Interviews lasted between one
and two hours, were recorded with the informants' permission and mostly took
place in restaurants and cafes in the city centre. Relevant themes, topics and issues
were identified by transcribing and inductively coding all the interviews.
Participant observation was an additional method to make the process of aes-
thetic production, and the strategic decisions and interactions between models and
beauty producers involved, comprehensible. Most observations were made in the
presence of my interview informants, often during fashion shows. Backstage
I observed models' professional practices and interactions with, for example, styl-
ists, make-up artists and hairdressers. I also engaged in various body practices with
models, especially those discussed during the interviews, like eating, drinking and
exercising, which showed how models `do beauty' outside official working hours.
All observations were recorded as field reports and analysed along the same lines
as the interviews. These complementary sources resulted in comprehensive, `thick
descriptive' ethnographic narratives and situational accounts of the practices and
experiences of a wide variety of informants. This provided a person-centred, experi-
ential understanding of fashion modeling from the viewpoints of persons in par-
ticular situations (Hollan, 2001).

Neutral body-objects on display
Castings, where fashion models present themselves to clients, typically designers or
fashion label representatives, are the primary professional situation where models
are simultaneously objectified in multiple ways. A model's job search typically
begins here. In preparation, agents (usually women) sometimes advise models to
downplay personal taste and style: `When I started at my agency in the
Netherlands, I was an alternative looking girl. They wanted me to adapt how
I dressed. Because, when you visit a client, you must give the impression that
you are a model, not just a pretty girl wearing baggy pants' (Keesje, 23,
Amsterdam). Fashion professionals like bookers, stylists and designers use meta-
phors like `canvas', `dress up doll' and `coat hanger' to describe models' function as
objects. Models themselves use similar terms: `I think saying whether you're beau-
tiful is a difficult thing. I know I'm pretty, but [. . .] Well, I'm just a good, neutral
basis to work with' (Jolanda, 22, Amsterdam).
You have to be pretty natural, you can't show up at castings wearing thick eyeliner
and red lipstick, because then you're already too much a character. You must always
give the impression of a clean slate, that they can form you how they want to. But you
must also adapt to the specific customer. If someone wants a tough girl, and you arrive
in a sweet flowery dress, some clients simply cannot imagine how you can be different.
Their lack of imagination is unbelievable! (Chantal, 22, Amsterdam)
Neutrality allows clients to `imagine' various possible looks. For other beauty
producers too, uniformity and neutrality are beneficial to the creation of new
fashions. Models are thus required to be `chameleons' (Soley-Beltran, 2004: 317),
with a stable, neutral look `to show a million different faces' (Katrina, 26, Warsaw).
Modeling for eight years, Keesje explains: `I have a pretty expressive face. I can
look very different in one picture compared to another. You could easily think it's
someone else [. . .] You need to be adaptive to the situation. To look very different.
That makes you work a lot' (Keesje, 23, Amsterdam).
The beauty standards of this `neutral basis' are incongruent with how many
models wish to look. Chantal distinguishes `industrial' demands from her own
ideal. Although considered beautiful by others, she feels that her looks are incon-
sistent with `who she is'. Her subjectivity, her sense of self, is compromised:
I've always been jealous of black girls with afro hair. Precisely what I am not. I just
don't like this very white, pale skin. But this look is very dominant in fashion, which is
very discriminatory [. . .] a kind of uniform everybody has to adhere to [. . .] When you
become a model, you think: of course I must be pretty, because I'm a model. You
represent something, beauty. But my own ideal is different. The beauty that I have in
the eyes of others is just not who I am. (Chantal, 22, Amsterdam)
The demand to be a `blank slate', to downplay personal style, can be seen as a
denial of autonomy (Nussbaum, 1995). Clearly, if a model cannot look as she
8 Feminist Theory 0(0)
wants, her self-determination is limited. By being chameleons, models cede part of
their autonomy, limiting their space to define and make choices. While this form of
being objectified exists in service-providing sectors ­ flight attendants, counter staff
and shop floor workers are all required to adjust both looks and behaviours
(Warhurst and Nickson, 2001) ­ models work in an industry characterised by
constant change and renewal. According to fashion designer Lucy, `Fashion's a
hungry monster [. . .] the tempo of renewal is terrible. It's like a big war' (Lucy, 25,
Amsterdam). Models continuously deal with different clients with different
demands, resulting in constantly changing guidelines (Neff et al., 2005). To survive,
they have to be `fresh', flexible and adaptive. The requirement of adaptability and
continuous flexibility is exactly what is defined as chameleonism.
Another form of objectification that models are constantly subjected to is repla-
ceability, Nussbaum's `fungibility' (1995: 257). Due to the constant influx of aspir-
ing models, staying `fresh' becomes ever more arduous. `New faces' constantly
appear, eager to replace `old' models. In response, modeling industries have ever
shorter cycles, models are recruited ever younger, competition increases and
chances of rejection rise. The pressure on models to present their freshest, cleanest,
most `mouldable' manner increases: `The annoying side is having to attend cast-
ings, where there are many younger boys. And you sit there, and then this beautiful
boy comes walking in, looks at you, arrogantly, with a smirk, you know. That's
rather unpleasant. It's such a meat auction. Every time you sit there, with like, a
hundred pretty boys. You become very self-conscious' (Victor, 21, Amsterdam).
Paradoxically, models also have an interest in displaying uniqueness as this
improves their chances (Mears, 2013): `You have to show some character some-
how. Those other guys on the casting were like, empty. There were 250 boys. But
I had this attitude . . . so they picked me' (Brett, 22, Amsterdam). At the same time,
body practices like dieting, exercising or grooming actually diminish individuality
and differences. Ultimately, models work hard to look like each other, further
reducing their competitiveness and increasing their replaceability.
Since models cannot really differentiate themselves through outward appear-
ance, they employ emotional labour strategies. Victor purposefully manages
his emotions, projecting a charming, easygoing personality: `As a model I've
learned I have to be social. You can't just show up as your grumpy old self.
If you have a bad day, get over it, or don't go. You must give those people the
impression that you're a nice, laidback kind of person to work with' (Victor, 21,
Amsterdam). This emotional labour is, however, only occasionally successful.
Clients are often uninterested in personalities. At castings models are often
required to be silent and motionless. This implies and causes inertness: during
castings they are passive objects, to be watched and judged (Nussbaum, 1995:
257). Jolanda recounts:
My agency in Paris gave me a lesson on how to behave during castings, like a role
play. So, I introduced myself, and they said `oh that's nice of you, but not really
necessary'. It was too much. Like it doesn't matter who you are. I was too smiley, too
Holla 9
enthusiastic for Paris. At castings you really have to feel what's the right thing to do,
and adapt yourself to those situations. It's pretty hard. (Jolanda, 22, Amsterdam)
So, besides personal clothing styles, models' speech is often interpreted as `noise'.
While at some castings a limited ­ relaxed, upbeat ­ version of personality is
acceptable, at others a model's subjectivity is deemed entirely irrelevant. This dis-
interest is Nussbaum's denial of subjectivity (1995: 257).
Castings organise models as lined-up objects for sale, implying they can be hired
and temporarily owned by clients. That models become `possessed' by others is
ownership, another of Nussbaum's seven ways. Castings, a large proportion of
models' time `on the shop floor', are, significantly, referred to as `cattle calls'.
Usually overcrowded, they involve fierce competition and considerable chances
of rejection. Competition with many other, similar looking models, reminds
models of their interchangeability. Besides, modeling is project-based, making it
highly unpredictable (Neff et al., 2005). Clients can `take an option', `opting out' at
the last minute free of charge. The rationales are seldom shared, rendering models
unable to understand what they need to change. This replaceability causes perpet-
ual uncertainty and feelings of powerlessness. High-end model Rita, from Warsaw,
recounts how she was left uninformed till the last minute:
I was going to do a show for [a designer] in Paris. Backstage it was all very sophis-
ticated. There was no food and it was kind of not done to say, like, `hello, how are
you'. There was this tension. So I'm waiting for a fitting, I've taken off my clothes. I'm
naked with all those people around me. You try on a dress but it's not clear if they
want it, because they don't look at you. So I start walking around, showing the dress.
But you cannot really do this, it's not how it works. You're supposed to wait like a
beautiful mannequin. Then, they take off the dress in front of everybody, and you wait
for one, two, three hours, sitting there naked, because you don't know if you [. . .] will
show the dress. I try to cover myself but you must wait, you cannot get into your own
clothes again. You have to stay available. And I was hungry. At a point you're
supposed to eat something. And then finally someone comes to tell you the dress is
already on somebody else. But you still wait around, something might still happen
[. . .] After four hours of waiting and changing, this casting guy came to me, saying `oh,
don't worry, here you have a sweet. You can go home now, we aren't using you for
this show'. He gave me a fucking sweet! I didn't even get to know why they didn't
want me. (Rita, 27, Warsaw)
For models, who are often denied basic insights into creative decisions, their work is full
of surprises. Understandably, they experience this as neither enjoyable nor exciting.
Physical scrutiny and violability
Using Nussbaum's seven dimensions, the previous section demonstrated that
fashion models are objectified incessantly, simultaneously, in different ways.
10 Feminist Theory 0(0)
As different forms of objectification pile up, the experience becomes more persist-
ent. When models' subjectivity is unrecognised to the point of feeling invisible, it
weighs on them. Even when their presence is acknowledged, their appearance is
often contested. Agents, clients and designers stress physical imperfections, sug-
gesting practices of improvement to `make it work'. Being physically scrutinised is
experienced as an integral part of the job: `Skinny, skinny, skinny. They just want
me to be more skinny [. . .] I am the most skinny person I know, of all my friends!
I don't think it is nice. They measure me and say I must lose weight. I am too fat'
(Nancy, 20, Warsaw). Maintaining a strict boundary between one's own body and
the altering creative hands of other professionals is not feasible for models, and
their bodily boundaries are inevitably exceeded when a look is collectively created.
While models carry out body practices like dieting and exercising in private, on the
set they are `worked upon' by others. In Paris, I observed four fashion models
backstage, chatting and fiddling with mobile phones. Stylists and make-up artists
interfered to adjust or apply something to their bodies or faces without ever asking.
In fact, the models were never verbally addressed. Although none of the work was
explained or discussed, the models knew exactly what was expected. Efficiently,
almost automatically, they adopted the right posture to facilitate the restyling of
hairdos, the updating of make-up or the taking of photographs, not appearing the
least distressed about ceding part of their bodily autonomy or becoming `violable'
(Nussbaum, 1995: 257). Instead, they appeared resigned to temporarily abandon-
ing their physical boundaries.
In some cases, however, aesthetic requirements exceed personal boundaries,
impairing physical integrity. Lynn recounts:
I have many beauty spots on my face. It's a problem. My agency wanted them
removed by a plastic surgeon. But my friends and family said `that's what makes
you you, don't do it'. I was also like, they use Photoshop for just about everything
on a photograph, so why not remove my beauty spots digitally? Then I can keep them.
Surgery will leave scars anyway, so they'll have to brush that away too. But they
didn't accept this, so they removed me from their files. (Lynn, 19, Amsterdam)
Objecting preserved Lynn's bodily integrity but also led her to involuntarily and
prematurely quitting modeling.
Violability shows how other professionals view models: as tools, thus fore-
grounding models' instrumentality (Nussbaum, 1995: 258). Monique, a Parisian
booker, reduces models' bodies to their use-value, describing them as `practically
no more useful than a coat rack [portemanteau]'. This can lead to models like Macy
internalising this:
My appearance is a means. It's not my own accomplishment, I'm born this way.
Intellect is something that you can develop, you can work on to accomplish some-
thing. Looks are just genetics. Of course you can work on your appearance, like going
to the hairdresser, getting your eyebrows plucked, going on a diet. But for me,
Holla 11
4 kilograms more or less is not what makes me more beautiful or ugly. Either way,
I still have an unnatural weight, so it's not really . . . something to be proud of.
(Macy, 21, Amsterdam)
Macy takes no credit for her looks or success. Interestingly, this also exempts her
from personal accountability in cases of failure, protecting her against criticism or
rejection. This suggests that objectification as self-instrumentalisation is a strategy
to cope with being a critically scrutinised aesthetic object, susceptible to failure.
Gendered experiences of objectification
Although both male and female fashion models are objectified, female models are
more preoccupied by it, and refer to it more often during interviews, expressing
vexation. Male models speak of it less, and when they do, seem to experience it less
problematically. Brett, for example, has little difficulty with being put `up for bids':
`My picture was in the Cosmopolitan, with a little story. It was funny, people could
bid money to get a date with me. I was totally fine with that, except, I didn't want
to go out with a guy. But of course, the highest bidder was a guy! I kinda knew that
was going to happen' (Brett, 22, Amsterdam). While this is objectification as own-
ership, Brett seems unoffended, even describing it as `funny', because although he
would have preferred a woman, he feels it was for a good cause, the proceeds going
to charity.
While Rick from Amsterdam is less indifferent, he has learned to be apathetic
towards people disinterested in his subjectivity, and also sees benefits in being
appreciated for his looks:
They only treat you that way because of your looks, which feels kinda weird. But on
the positive side, I also get many things done because I look good. You know, I'm
always open to getting to know people for who they are, whether it's a lady cleaning
the toilets at McDonald's or a fashion company director. But in this industry people
judge you only based on your exterior. And they assume I'm stupid. I think that's a
shame. In the beginning this worried me, but now I don't care anymore. Everything is
fake. Those people are fake and not that important anyway. (Rick, 28, Amsterdam)
Joey tells how, compared to female models, male models have more opportunities
to resist:
Amongst guys there is less competition. Most girls are pretty young and inexperi-
enced. They have to sell themselves in a super competitive industry and many are
really insecure. They should try not to get overruled all the time by those fashion
people who think the world of themselves. If you disagree with something, go against
it [. . .] There was this stylist telling a girl to go topless for a sexy picture. Obviously she
wasn't comfortable with it. But for girls, when things go too far, it's far more difficult
to say no. The competitive pressure is very high for them. So they do it anyway.

I've never really experienced that myself, but I think this happens a lot to girls. (Joey,
24, Amsterdam)
Joey correctly signals that male and female models operate in different market seg-
ments, with different levels of competition. Female models experience at least two
forms of objectification to a greater extent: they are more replaceable (fungible), and
consequently, more violable. So, while all models experience objectification, female
models are likely to experience a wider variety of forms, have fewer resources to
resist them and therefore tend to experience it more problematically.
How objectification becomes bearable and pleasurable
As models can experience objectification as unpleasant and even dehumanising,
they try to cope in several ways. First, they resist feelings of alienation by redefining
their work as `active performance' instead of as `passive appearance' (Mears, 2011):
Posing comes naturally, I'm not shy in front of the camera. It's like acting, especially
on a bad day. There are only a few faces they want, like smiling or sensual. But they
never want to see a sad face! I work with memories to change my mood, to manipulate
what I express on a picture [. . .] Modeling is a good way to practice to become an
actress. (Manon, 24, Paris)
This framing allows models to protect themselves from the uncertainty and criti-
cism inherent in their job: in case of rejection, it is their performance that falls
short, not their entire `embodied selves' (cf. Mears, 2013: 138). This armouring
strategy is similar to how Macy instrumentalised herself.
Second, models can use withdrawal, separating their emotive, `feeling self' from
their physical body, an almost `Cartesian move' (Gillies et al., 2004). Nahima, a
former high-end model from Paris, sometimes achieves this through cocaine. Her
account of how professionals around her respond is illuminating: `It was like I was
there, but at the same time I wasn't. And it turned out that they ``so loved my
look''. To see this absence in your gaze, the arrogance and indifference you convey
when you've done a line. So in the end, me and everybody on the set benefited from
it' (Nahima, 32, currently living in Brussels). Magdalena from Poland, who is
modeling for a haute couture fashion show in Paris, also uses withdrawal. Unlike
in a regular runway show, here, models stand motionless on a stage, statue-like, for
about twenty minutes each time. Afterwards, Magdalena tells me about her phys-
ical discomfort: standing still for so long wearing high-heeled shoes caused cramps
in her limbs. Nevertheless, she is not particularly bothered because she escaped by
withdrawing: `I let my imagination run free, by making up all kinds of stories. And
later, when I'm alone, I write them up. So actually I'm creating things in my head
while I'm standing still. And nobody sees it, it's like, my little secret' (Magdalena,
19, Warsaw). In Mahmood's terms, Magdalena exerts `docile agency': rather than
passivity or abandonment of agency, her withdrawal involves effort, exertion and
Holla 13
achievement, and indicates a certain malleability while carrying out the skilful
practice of being an aesthetic object on display (2001: 210). Withdrawing helps
Magdalena to endure situations where being an object is dreadful. A year later, in
Warsaw, Magdalena proudly tells me that her stories have been published.
Models do not, however, need to act out creativity on a completely different
plane. Under certain conditions, being objectified coincides with creative practice,
giving a strong sense of empowerment. Models can find gratification when they can
`work it' before a camera, for example: `I feel beautiful when I feel like ``okay, I did
a good job''. There was this difficult photo shoot, where they wanted some new
qualities or some new attitude. So I had to work. The whole thing needed some
extra preparation. Finally, this shoot changed me. I learned new things and I got
people's acceptance, even their adoration' (Kathy, 21, Warsaw). Kathy is encour-
aged by the photographer to `show him what she's got'. By actively and creatively
contributing, Kathy feels acknowledged as a skilful subject. She takes an active
part in her objectification, which, in her experience, changes her for the better. In
Cahill's terms, her objectification enhances her sense of self (2012: x). Jolanda
describes similar feelings of empowerment:
I just had a shoot for ELLE. For me that was like, wow! And I noticed how much
more self-assured I had become from my experience in London. I did everything that
came to mind, and just worked it. I gave it all, and it went very naturally. It was a
beautiful moment. Finally I achieved that I could pose, naturally and with self-con-
fidence. It was really very nice. (Jolanda, 22, Amsterdam)
The runway show is the ultimate situation where models experience excitement,
pride and empowerment as a display object. Liberated from the scrutinising gazes
of stylists, agents, designers and make-up artists, a model's power position is com-
pletely inverted. During those few minutes under the spotlights, models are sub-
jected to the appraising, usually admiring, gazes of a broader audience of fashion
consumers and devotees. As Victor exclaims: `Yes! On the runway, it is just my time
to shine!' (Victor, 21, Amsterdam).
While walking runways is nerve-wracking, it also gives an adrenaline rush.
The shows are often complemented by loud, rhythmic music directing the tempo
at which models walk. At the end of the catwalk is the `pit', full of ­ mainly male ­
photographers, their cameras snapping at the models, who usually pause to pose,
to shoot looks, making sure the photographers get a good shot. The audience is in
darkness, the only light is on the runway. Models rarely smile or make eye contact
with the public while walking; instead, all eyes are on them.
Being regarded with praise and admiration gives powerful, positive feelings.
Understandably, models are drawn to, and draw energy from, such situations.
Katrina from Warsaw even reports intense feelings of relief: `When you're on the
runway, then you can just forget about all that. It is almost like giving birth! You
go through all that trouble, just for those few minutes of walking' (Katrina, 26,
Warsaw). Walking a show involves walking in high-heeled shoes without

stumbling, maintaining a confident physical comportment and keeping a straight
face. Like models who speak about `working it' during photo shoots, runway
models describe walking as a skilful practice, requiring training. The objectification
that certainly occurs becomes bearable, even pleasurable, as it coincides with
experiences of being acknowledged as skilful, creative subjects.
For objectification to become less tedious and more enjoyable for models, three
modes of objectification must be absent: being treated as passive or inert, not being
acknowledged as a subject and being denied one's autonomy. Unfortunately for
most models, especially `new faces' with little experience, this is rare, although
experienced models have the leeway to `work it'. Keesje (23, Amsterdam), who
calls herself `a fossil', can make suggestions about lighting techniques and make-up:
`I know my face by now, so I know what works. These people trust me if I say
something is probably not going to look good'.
Conclusions
Analysing the extreme case of fashion modeling, this article empirically demon-
strated how objectification occurs in professional practice, shedding light on object-
ification as a multifaceted, situationally and institutionally embedded practice that
is experienced in a range of ways. In line with Nussbaum, objectification manifests
itself through various distinct but related forms, a multiplicity most observable at
castings, where different forms accumulate and coincide with the scrutinising gazes
of clients, making it an unsettling experience.
This article contributes to existing feminist perspectives, arguing that objectifi-
cation is often, but not inevitably, related to subordination. However, it is not
necessarily unpleasant: when models perform as aesthetic objects on a runway,
they feel admired, empowered and proud. While this demonstrates the importance
of the gaze, it also highlights the importance of the body in practice under different
conditions. When models actively engage in being objectified (Cahill, 2012) through
creatively and skilfully `working it', they feel appreciated, fulfilled and empowered,
even when treated as things. Objectification thus potentially contributes to a `flour-
ishing sense of self'.
This study raises new questions about subjectivity and selfhood. The multiplicity
of objectification in this specific institutional context raises the question of object-
ification in nonprofessional, private settings, as well as in other work settings,
where objectified people may have fewer resources and less symbolic status than
models, whose `aesthetic capital' makes their objectification a source of profit.
This analysis leads to reconsideration of the effects of objectification: how do
people subjectively experience viewing the images of objectified models? Like the
experience of models, the consumption of objectifying images is a situated, multi-
faceted process. This may lead to self-objectification, as social psychologists have
argued, but even this may be experienced and enacted in different ways. The sub-
jectivities provoked and produced by fashion's influential visual culture are worth
considering from an ethnographic, experiential angle.

This article also contributes to studies of aesthetics. While in feminist literature,
objectification is often equated with sexualisation, this study shows how models are
predominantly aesthetically objectified. This is consistent with the findings of
Kuipers et al. (2016) that all models, male and female, are increasingly objectified
in fashion photographs, but not necessarily in a sexual way. While aesthetic object-
ification is central to fashion modeling, the `aestheticised body' is also of growing
significance in society at large, as it becomes a job qualification in post-industrial
`aesthetic economies'. Future research could consider aesthetic objectification in
relation to recent aesthetic economies (Entwistle, 2002).
Models are high-status individuals and, ultimately, symbolic holders of aesthetic
capital. Although they do not necessarily see themselves as victims, from an out-
sider perspective their practices are easily depicted as a surrendering of power.
Investigating how models emotionally and practically respond to objectification
­ a process which Cahill considers part and parcel of social interaction ­ shows that
models enact `docile agency' (Mahmood, 2001). Unlike explicit resistance to sub-
ordination, this entails subtler forms of coping. For example, when objectification
is troublesome, models engage in self-instrumentalisation or withdrawal, or rede-
fine their work as acting. All these strategies involve the construction of a `split
self', containing a personal, emotive, authentic, creative self, and a physical, instru-
mental, emotionless, malleable self. Such a `Cartesian move' helps models to cope.
The willingness to endure annoying situations, to suffer when work is stressful or
demeaning and to persist in acquiring skills, are powerful ways for models to deal
with objectification and to be successful.
Finally, this experiential perspective, which involves models' different emotional
and practical responses, calls into question theoretical arguments about the object-
ification of disempowered subjects, and assumptions about objectification being
inherently immoral. Objectification is socially rooted in institutions and specific
situations. This matters considerably for its varying forms and levels of intensity.
Besides, it can be experienced in diverse ways by different people. This does not
make objectification less effective: situations of collaborative social action (in this
case, collective aesthetic production) are by no means less successful when people
have different subjective experiences of them (Mol, 2008). Thus, this study does not
imply that objectification is less compelling as a process, or is easy to avoid, but
rather that objectification might be all the more effective because it is embedded in
different social contexts, and adapts itself accordingly.
