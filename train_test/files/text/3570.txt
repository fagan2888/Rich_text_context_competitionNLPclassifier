Abstract
A 71-year-old man presented with a thymic mass involving the superior vena cava.
A mediastinoscopical biopsy initially suggested a diagnosis of type A thymoma. After neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, the patient underwent en-bloc thymectomy and vascular resection for a pathology-
confirmed type B3 thymoma involving the superior vena cava, the left brachiocephalic vein and the
distal part of the right brachiocephalic vein. Adjuvant radiotherapy was administered. Two years
after the primary surgery, abdominal computed tomography (CT) and whole body fluorodeox-
yglucose (18-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scans showed a single hepatic lesion that
was treated with wedge liver resection. Pathological examination confirmed metastatic type B3
thymoma. Almost 4 years later, abdominal CT and 18-FDG PET revealed a 2.9-cm solid mass
involving the body of the pancreas. Distal pancreatectomy with lymph node dissection was
performed. Pathological examination showed a pancreatic metastasis from a type B3 thymoma,
without lymph node involvement. The patient is alive and free of disease 6 months after the
pancreatectomy (68 months after the initial thymectomy surgery). Intra-abdominal recurrence and
pancreatic metastases are very uncommon manifestations of thymoma, but this event should be
kept in mind when an abdominal mass is seen during follow-up.

Introduction
Thymic neoplasms are extremely rare, rep-
resenting less than 1% of all human malig-
nant tumours and there are different
subtypes of thymic neoplasms described in
the literature.1 Thymic carcinoma is a pri-
mary malignant epithelial tumour of the

Organization,2,3 and it is the most common
histotype in adults.1 Thymoma is commonly
considered a relatively indolent tumour and
it is only in the advanced stages that it
spreads locally in the chest cavity.
Extrathoracic metastatic localizations are
uncommon4 and usually associated with
thymic carcinoma or thymic neuroendocrine
tumours.5,6
The present case report describes a patient
with thymoma who developed liver and
pancreatic metastases after thymectomy.
Case report
A 71-year-old man was admitted in June
2010 to the Department of Thoracic
Surgery, University of Padua, Padua, Italy
complaining of chest pain, shortness of
breath and recurrent episodes of arm and
facial swelling. Computed tomography (CT)
of the thorax showed a mediastinal solid
mass involving the superior vena cava.
Fluorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG) positron
emission tomography (PET) revealed a
mass showing the pathological uptake of
18-FDG with a standardized uptake value
(SUV) of 12.49. A mediastinoscopical
biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of type A
thymoma. Because of the extension of the
neoplasm, the patient underwent neoadju-
vant chemotherapy with a cisplatin, epiru-
bicin and etoposide regimen, which resulted
in stable disease. In December 2010, the
patient underwent thoracotomy: the mass
involved the superior vena cava (SVC), the
left brachiocephalic vein and the distal part
of the right brachiocephalic vein (RBV). En-
bloc total thymectomy with segmental exci-
sion of the superior lobe of the right lung
was performed, together with a Gore-tex
prosthesis bypass between the RBV and
SVC. Histopathology showed type B3 thym-
oma, Masaoka stage III.7 Adjuvant radio-
therapy (54 Gy) was administered.
In January 2012, a routine 18-FDG PET/
CT showed a pathological uptake of the
radiotracer in the fourth liver segment with
no other site of disease (SUV 8.83). Four
months later the lesion became bigger, with
a higher SUV (14.4). In July 2012, a wedge
resection of the hepatic lesion was per-
formed. Pathological examination showed
liver metastasis of type B3 thymoma.
In November 2015, during regular
follow-up, an abdominal CT showed a
2.9 cm solid mass involving the body of the
pancreas (Figure 1). Pathological examin-
ation of the ultrasonographic guided-
percutaneous aspiration biopsy of the mass

showed a epithelial neoplasm compatible
with a thymic origin. The patient was
referred to the Department of Surgery,
Oncology and Gastroenterology,
University of Padua, Padua, Italy. 18-FDG
PET/CT showed pathological accumulation
of the radiotracer in the peripancreatic
mass, with an SUV of 14.72 (Figure 2).
In February 2016, the patient underwent
laparotomy. A solid mass involving the
body of the pancreas was confirmed and a
spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy was
performed. Final histopathology revealed a
pancreatic recurrence of type B3 thymoma
involving the peripancreatic connective
tissue with no lymph node metastases. The
thymic neoplastic cells had a spindle/oval
shape, lacking nuclear atypia, with very few
non-neoplastic lymphocytes. The cells had
oval or slightly elongated nuclei, finely
dispersed chromatin, and inconspicuous
nucleoli. Cells were arranged in ill-defined

bundles and mitotic figures were extremely
rare (Figure 3).
The postoperative course of the patient
was complicated by type B pancreatic fis-
tula,8 which was treated with drainage
replacement under radiological guidance.
Six months after the pancreatectomy (i.e.
68 months after the initial thymectomy) the
patient is alive and free of disease. A recent
whole body PET/CT scan did not show any
pathological uptake of the 18-FDG
radiotracer.
Discussion
Metastatic tumours to the pancreas are
increasingly being recognized in clinical
practice and patients with isolated pancre-
atic disease are candidates for pancreatic
resection.9 A recent review of the English
literature found several malignant tumours
metastasizing to the pancreas and many of
these were single case reports.10 In this
present paper, the case of very uncommon
intra-abdominal metastases from a thym-
oma in an asymptomatic patient is pre-
sented; he had a wedge liver resection and
a distal pancreatectomy for metastatic
thymoma, 2 and 5 years after primary
tumour resection, respectively. Although
the follow-up is too short, this case empha-
sizes the role of surgery for selected, fit
patients with limited disease, especially for
tumours not responsive to chemotherapy
and/or radiotherapy.
Thymic epithelial tumours are classified
into thymoma, thymic carcinoma and
thymic neuroendocrine tumours.6 The inci-
dence of thymic tumours is 0.15/100 000
cases per year and they represent 20% of all
mediastinal tumours.6 Thymoma is com-
monly considered a slow growing tumour
with a relatively benign biological behav-
iour.6 Thymomas are subclassified into five
types (A, AB, B1, B2, B3) according to the
WHO histological classification system.1,3
This classification is related to prognosis:
type A and AB show disease-free survival at
10 years in 100% of patients, type B1 and B2
in 83% and type B3 in 36%.11,12
In the present case, there was a discrep-
ancy between type A thymoma diagnosed at
mediastinoscopical biopsy and type B3 at
the final pathological examination of the
surgical specimen. Biopsy is not representa-
tive of the entire tumour so a definitive
diagnosis can only be accurately performed
after the evaluation of the resected tumour.
Another important prognostic factor is cap-
sular invasion. Noninvasive thymoma recur-
rence is estimated between 0% and 7%,
while invasive thymoma recurrence is
between 11% and 36%.13
Disease progression in thymomas is
mainly characterized by locoregional
spread involving the mediastinum and/or
the pleural cavity.4 The majority of distant
metastases occur in the lung.7 Extrathoracic
recurrences are extremely rare (3­6%)4 and
strongly associated with the B subtypes.11,12
Disease progression can be diagnosed years
after the resection of the primary neo-
plasm.13­16
Pancreatic metastatic thymomas are only
described in case reports and, to the best of
our knowledge, only three cases have been

A previous report described a case of pan-
creatic metastatic thymoma associated with
myasthenia gravis.13 Another report
described a case of pancreatic metastatic
thymoma not associated with myasthenia
gravis.14 In a series of pancreatic metastatic
cancers, one case of thymoma metastasis to
the body-tail of the pancreas was
described.15 Clinical details of the three
published cases and the present patient are
described in Table 1. Two patients were
asymptomatic, one presented with myasthe-
nia gravis and one presented with jaundice.
Two patients underwent radical pancreatec-
tomy, one received a biliary bypass, while one
patient with concomitant pancreatic and
brain metastases, received only supportive
care. Survival details were available for only
two patients, both were alive after 6 and 36
months, respectively. One patient died sev-
eral, unspecified, months after surgery.14
Liver metastases are also rare, but among
the extrathoracic metastatic localizations,
liver is the second most common site.16
Reviewing the English literature identified
fifteen cases of metastatic thymoma to the
liver,7,16­22 but only in six cases was the liver
the only site of extrathoracic recurrence; and
detailed information was only available for
four cases.17,19­21 Three case reports
described metachronous single liver metas-
tases after primary resection of the thym-
oma;19­21 and a fourth report described a
case of multiple metastatic thymoma to the
liver (Table 2).17 Neoadjuvant chemother-
apy was administrated and it resulted in
regression of the primary lesion, which was

completely resected, and one persistent hep-
atic nodule was treated with radiofrequency
ablation.17 The patient was alive and free of
disease 7 months after surgery.17 Another
case report described a patient with meta-
static thymoma to the lung, lymph nodes,
bone and liver treated with surgery, radio-
therapy and polychemotherapies who sur-
vived 10 years after the initial diagnosis.22 In
contrast to the present case, there have not
been any cases reported in the literature
describing a double haematogenous meta-
chronous metastatic abdominal localization
originating from a type B3 thymoma.
In conclusion, the extrathoracic recur-
rence of thymoma is very rare and may
occur years after resection of the primary
tumour. Therefore, lifelong follow-up is
strongly recommended for all patients with
a history of thymoma and, in cases of
isolated abdominal recurrence, surgery
appears to be the treatment of choice.
