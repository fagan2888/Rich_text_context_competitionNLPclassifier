Abstract
Objective: To clarify the association between atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI) and the
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs1234313 and rs1234314 (in TNFSF4) and rs17568
(in TNFRSF4).
Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of patients with ACI and healthy
control subjects. The presence of carotid plaque was determined. Rs1234313, rs1234314 and
rs17568 were characterized via SNP genotyping assay and verified by DNA sequencing.
Results: Genotype distributions were in Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium. There were no significant
differences in the allele and genotype distributions of rs1234313, rs1234314 and rs17568 between
patients with ACI (n ¼ 450) and healthy control subjects (n ¼ 378), or between patients with ACI
and carotid plaque (n ¼ 342) and controls.
Conclusions: There were no significant associations between rs1234313, rs1234314 and rs17568
and ACI risk in a Han Chinese population.

Introduction
The TNFSF4 gene (tumour necrosis factor
ligand superfamily member 4; also known as
OX40L) is expressed by activated B cells,
endothelial cells, and activated CD4þ and
CD8þ T-cells.1­3 The TNFSF4 receptor,
TNFRSF4 (tumour necrosis factor receptor
superfamily member 4; also known as
OX40) is also expressed on activated T
cells.4 TNFSF4 is a T-cell activator that
promotes the survival of CD4þ T-cells at
sites of inflammation5 and plays a role in
diseases with an inflammatory component.6
When activated, T cells produce proinflam-
matory cytokines, which are largely respon-
sible for plaque rupture and thrombus
formation.7
Evidence suggests that TNFSF4 and
TNFRSF4 influence susceptibility to athero-
sclerosis and atherosclerotic disease.6,8­13
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in
TNFSF4 are associated with myocardial
infarction8,10 and venous thromboembol-
ism.14 In addition, there is evidence that
TNFSF4 mRNA levels are significantly
higher in human carotid atherosclerotic
lesions, but the TNFSF4 SNP rs3850641 is
not associated with ischaemic stroke risk.9
We have shown that the TNFSF4 SNP
rs3861950 is associated with the risk of
atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI),
but that rs3850641 is not associated with
ACI risk.15 In contrast, others have found
no significant association between TNFSF4
SNP (including rs3850641, rs3861950 and
rs1234313) and the severity of coronary
heart disease,16 myocardial infarction,17
and carotid atherosclerotic plaque thicken-
ing.18 A study in a Chinese population
found that the TNFRSF4 SNP rs17568 is
associated with coronary syndrome risk,
whereas the TNFSF4 SNP rs3850641 is
not.8 TNFRSF4 has also been shown to be
a susceptibility gene in essential hyperten-
sion.19 Little is known about the role of
TNFSF4 and TNFRSF4 in ACI, however.
Worldwide, ACI is the most common
form of stroke, and stroke is the leading
cause of death in China.20 The inflammatory
response plays a decisive role at different
stages of atherosclerosis and throughout the
progression of ACI.21 Carotid plaque, which
is a distinct phenotype of subclinical ath-
erosclerosis, is an inflammatory lesion asso-
ciated with a significantly increased risk of
ACI.22,23 The aim of the present study was
to clarify the potential association between
ACI and the SNP rs1234313 and rs1234314
(both located in the TNFSF4 promoter
region) and the TNFRSF4 SNP rs17568,
via SNP genotyping assay and genomic
DNA sequencing, in patients with ACI and
age-matched healthy control subjects.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study recruited ethnically Han Chinese
patients with ACI, diagnosed according to
the classification of acute stroke.15,24­26
Patients were recruited from the
Department of Neurology, Xiangya
Hospital, Central South University,
Changsha, China, between June 2007 and
December 2012. ACI was diagnosed via
brain magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic
resonance angiography, carotid artery ultra-
sonography, ophthalmoscopy and cardiac
colour ultrasonography, and was confirmed
by at least two neurologists. Exclusion
criteria were: cerebral infarction (CI) asso-
ciated with cardiac arrhythmia, arteritis,
trauma, haematopathy, medication,
Huang et al. 437
tumour, cerebrovascular malformation or
aneurysm; haemorrhagic infarct; liver or
kidney dysfunction; autoimmune disease;
pregnancy; CI of indeterminate cause.
Intima­media thickness and plaques were
assessed by high-resolution B-mode ultra-
sonography using a VolusonÕ 730 (GE
Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) with a
6­12 MHz linear-array transducer. Bilateral
carotid bifurcations, and internal and
common carotid arteries, were examined.
The presence of carotid atherosclerotic
plaque was defined as an area of focal wall
thickening more than 50% greater than
surrounding wall thickness.18,22
The control population included age- and
sex-matched unrelated subjects undergoing
routine health screening at Xiangya
Hospital during the same period. Exclusion
criteria were: carotid plaque disclosed by
ultrasonography; atherosclerotic retinop-
athy disclosed by ophthalmoscopy; history
of cerebrovascular or cardiovascular dis-
ease; family history of stroke; cardiac
arrhythmia; haematological disease; endo-
crine or metabolic disorders; pregnancy.
For all participants, total serum cholesterol,
triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C) were quantified
according to standard procedures.
The study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of Central South University and
written informed consent was obtained from
all participants.
Genetic analyses
Peripheral blood (5 ml) was collected in
sterile tubes containing disodium ethylene-
diaminetetra-acetic acid and stored at
À20C until analysis. Genomic DNA was
extracted using a DNA blood kit (Qiagen,
Venlo, Netherlands) according to the manu-
facturer's instructions. Allele-specific
TaqManÕ (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) probes and primers were used
for the allelic discrimination of specific SNP.
Primer and probe sequences are shown in
Tables 1 and 2 (Shanghai Gene Core Bio
Technologies Company, Shanghai, China).

and genotyping analysis were performed on
an Applied Biosystems PrismÕ 7900HT
PCR System (Life Technologies) according
to the manufacturer's instructions; the
results were analysed using an allelic dis-
crimination assay program (Applied
Biosystems SDS 2.0; Life Technologies).
Genotyping accuracy was confirmed by
direct DNA sequencing of 150 randomly
selected samples using an ABI PrismÕ 3100
sequencer (Life Technologies).
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as mean Æ SD or n (%).
Continuous variables were compared using
Student's t-test; between-group differences
in genotype and allelic frequencies were
analysed via 2-test. Genotype frequencies
were tested for Hardy­Weinberg equilib-
rium. Odds ratios and 95% confidence
intervals were determined via Pearson's 2-
test. Statistical analyses were performed
using SPSSÕ version 19.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) for WindowsÕ. P-
values <0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
The study included 450 patients with ACI
(277 male/173 female; mean age 60.4 Æ 11.2
years; age range 41­86 years) and 378 con-
trol subjects (223 male/155 female; mean age
58.6 Æ 10.7 years; age range 43­85 years).
Baseline characteristics of the participants
are shown in Table 3. There were no statis-
tically significant between-group differences
in age,sex distribution, body mass index
(BMI) or LDL-C. Tobacco use, alcohol
consumption, blood sugar and triglycerides
were significantly higher and total choles-
terol and HDL-C were significantly lower in
patients with ACI compared with controls
(P < 0.05 for each comparison; Table 3).
Carotid atherosclerotic plaque was present
in 342/450 (76.0%) of the patients with ACI.
The distributions of rs1234313, rs123414
and rs17568 were in Hardy­Weinberg equi-
librium in both the patient and control
groups. DNA sequencing indicated that
the TaqManÕ PCR technique was highly
reproducible, with good sensitivity and spe-
cificity (data not shown).
Genotypic and allelic frequency distribu-
tions of the three SNP are shown in Table 4.
There were no statistically significant differ-
ences in genotype or allele frequency
between control subjects and patients with
ACI (with or without carotid plaque). In
addition, there were no significant between-
sex differences in genotype or allele fre-
quency (data not shown).
Discussion
Data from the present study indicate that
there were no significant differences between

jects in genome or allele frequency of
TNFSF4 rs1234313 and rs1234314, and
TNFRSF4 rs17568. In addition, there were
no significant differences between controls
and patients with both ACI and carotid
plaque. This finding suggests that these gene
polymorphisms are not associated with ACI
in the Han Chinese population.
The TNFSF4/TNFRSF4 pathway plays
a key role in atherosclerosis and atheroscler-
otic disease.8­13,27,28 Targeted TNFSF4
mutation attenuates the atherosclerotic pro-
cess in mice, while TNFSF4 overexpression
exacerbates atherosclerosis.8 It is unclear
which TNFSF4/TNFRSF4 polymorphisms
are associated with atherosclerotic dis-
ease, however.8,12,17,18 We have shown that
the TNFSF4 SNP rs3861950 (but not
rs3850641) was associated ACI risk in a
Han Chinese population.15 The present
finding that TNFSF4 rs1234313 and
rs1234314 were not associated with ACI is
consistent with findings from Chinese16
Swedish,9 and German populations17 that
found no relationship between these two
SNP and myocardial infarction.
There is evidence that TNFRSF4 co-
localizes with an atherosclerosis quantitative
trait locus in mice29 and with a myocardial
infarction locus in humans.30 There was no
significant difference in genome or allele
frequency of TNFRSF4 SNP rs17568
between patients with ACI and control
subjects in the present study. This finding
is in accordance with a study from Sweden,
in which the less-common allele of rs17568
did not affect the protein product and was
not associated with myocardial infarction.11
In contrast with the present data, a study of
a Chinese population found that carriers of
the rs17568 G allele had a significantly
increased risk of acute coronary
syndrome.12
Carotid plaque is a distinct phenotype of
subclinical atherosclerosis that is strongly
associated with increased risk of ACI,22,23
but the role of TNFSF4/TNFRSF4 in car-
otid plaque-associated ACI is unclear.
TNFSF4 mRNA levels were found to be

significantly higher in human carotid ath-
erosclerotic lesions than normal tissue, but
TNFSF4 rs3850641 was not associated with
ischaemic stroke risk.9 Although rs1234313
may be associated with carotid plaque
thickening,18 there was no relationship
between rs1234313 and ACI risk in the
present study. The interaction between gen-
etic and environmental factors may
explain the variation in prevalence of ath-
erosclerotic diseases in different popula-
tions. Indeed, we have previously provided
evidence for an association between
TNFSF4 rs3861950 and ACI risk in a Han
Chinese population.15 ACI has a complex
aetiology involving multiple genes and
nongenetic factors.18,20 Given the role of
TNFSF4/TNFRSF4 as regulators of
immune and inflammatory processes
involved in atherosclerotic disease, further
studies involving larger populations are
warranted, to clarify the impact of poly-
morphisms on the risk of ACI.
In conclusion, the present study found no
significant association between ACI risk in a
Han Chinese population and the TNFSF4/
TNFRSF4 SNP rs1234313, rs1234314 and
rs17568.
