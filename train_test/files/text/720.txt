Within the field of aging, the conceptualization and measurement of functioning has been
dominated by the disability model. In this paper, one limitation of that model is described by
calling attention to a distinction between three "tenses" of functioning. Inadequate attention
has been paid to the distinction between the capacity to function in the abstract (hypothetical
tense) and actual performance in daily life (enacted tense). Failure to attend to this distinction
has obscured considerable discordance between what people say they are able to do in
standard functional disability assessments, and what they actually do at home. To illustrate
this point, data from the MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging comparing the hypothetical
to the enacted tenses are presented. These data show a consistent pattern of discordance
between these two tenses.

Discordance Among Hypothetical,
Experimental, and Enacted Function
in Older Adults
Thomas A. Glass, PhD1
Substantial discordance can be observed be-
tween the level of functioning older persons are ca-
pable of (based on self-reports), and how actively
and independently they function in the "real"
world. Recognition of this discordance has given
rise to the distinction between pathology, impair-
ment, disability, and handicap featured in the World
Health Organization's taxonomy of functioning, the
International Classification of Impairments, Disabil-
ity, and Handicap (ICIDH) (World Health Organ-
ization, 1980). This article argues that the WHO dis-
tinction has not gone far enough in sensitizing
gerontologists to the complexity of late life func-
tioning. This has resulted in a gap in conceptualiza-
tion and research due to the failure to differentiate
among three "tenses" of functioning (hypothetical,
experimental, and enacted). This article presents a
model to elucidate the distinctions among these
tenses in an effort to fill this gap. Empirical evidence
of the existence of this phenomenon will also be
provided through a report on a data set which asks
questions of high-functioning elderly persons from
the perspective of more than one tense.

conceptual scheme for thinking about functioning
has been the disability model (Branch, Katz, Kniep-
mann, & Papsidero, 1984; Clark, Stump, & Wolinsky,
1997; Hubert, Bloch, & Fries, 1993; Jette, 1987; Jette,
1994; Jette & Branch, 1985; Katz, Downs, Cash, &
Grotz, 1970; Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, & Jaffe,
1963; Lawrence & Jette, 1996; Nagi, 1965; Pinsky,
Branch, Jette, Haynes, Feinleib, Cornoni-Huntley, &
Bailey, 1985; Verbrugge & Jette, 1994; Verbrugge,
Lepkowski, & Konkol, 1991). An indication of the im-
portance of this model is the fact that the term dis-
ability has become nearly synonymous with the con-
cept of functioning or functional status (McDowell
& Newell, 1987). The disability model grew out of the
work of Nagi in sociology (Nagi, 1965; Nagi, 1976;
Nagi, 1991) and Katz and others in medicine (Katz et
al., 1970; Katz et al., 1963) as an attempt to move
beyond the narrow focus on the presence or absence
of disease. Katz developed the activities of daily liv-
ing (ADL) index to measure both the effectiveness of
treatments and the underlying mortality risk in frail
elderly populations. That the ADL index would be-
come synonymous with functioning was foretold in
the subtitle of Katz's first article, "The index of ADL:
A standardized measure of biological and psychoso-
cial function" (Katz et al., 1963). Today more than
fifty ADL scales have been developed and most, in-
cluding the Katz and the Barthel Indices, were
specifically intended to measure functioning among
institutionalized patients (Mahoney & Barthel, 1965).
The disability model, as exemplified by the ICIDH,
is pictured as a linear pathway leading from disease
to handicap (in Nagi's framework) (see Appendix,

Handicap (ICIDH).
Note 1). The emphasis is on the probabilistic rather
than deterministic nature of those transitions (Fig-
ure 1). The model begins with disease (pathology),
which predisposes to impairment (loss of structure
or function), which predisposes to disability (re-
striction or lack of ability), and finally to handicap
(disadvantage). Research which is informed by the
disability model shares the idea that functioning
should be understood in terms of functional capa-
bilities in relation to the constraints placed on the
individual by the outside world. In both its concepts
and its measures, this model reflects an emphasis
on functional ability as a hypothetical construct,
rather than actual performance in daily life. As an
example, in a recent test of the disability model
using data from the Longitudinal Study of Aging,
Lawrence and Jette (1996) excluded subjects who
reported that they did not engage in ADL activities
because "it was not possible to determine if they
were abled or disable." This tendency to emphasize
functional capability and to ignore functional per-
formance reflects the history of the disability model
as grounded in studies of functional status among
older patients in hospitals and nursing homes, far
removed from the real-world constraints which both
enable and dampen functional performance out-
side of the institutional setting.
While the disability model continues to predomi-
nate the research and policy arenas, several impor-
tant criticisms of this model have emerged. Among
these concerns is that it remains focused on a nar-
row band of functioning, too closely linked to phys-
ical function and the presence of disease. Numerous
researchers have sought to broaden the definition
of functioning beyond the limited scope of self-care
(ADLs). First among the revisions was instrumental
activities of daily living (IADL), developed in the
1970s, which were designed to better capture do-
mains of functioning among persons living in the
community through the addition of domestic main-
tenance tasks (Lawton & Brody, 1969; Lawton, Moss,
Fulcomer, & Kleban, 1982).
Motivated primarily by concerns over measure-
ment problems, another group of researchers have
argued for performance-based measures of func-
tioning (Curalnik, Branch, Cummings, & Curb, 1989;
Reuben, Valle, Hays, & Siu, 1995; Tinetti, 1986). These
measures have sought to minimize the difficulties
arising from the use of self-reports, and are an
attempt to move beyond the assessment of the hy-
pothetical tense to which most standard self-
reported ADL scales are limited. Yet, while the shift
to performance-based assessments has been an im-
portant extension into the experimental tense, this
has not lead to a generalized interest in perfor-
mance outside the laboratory.
Still others have called for a broadening of our
concepts of function toward social functioning
(Bortz, 1989; Jette & Branch, 1981). Verbrugge and
Jette (1994) have recently called for the inclusion of
higher-level activities including social and leisure
activity, trips, child care, and recreation. Other inves-
tigators have begun to examine productive activity
as one dimension of higher-level functioning (Butler
& Gleason, 1985; Class, Seeman, Herzog, Kahn, &
Berkman, 1995; Herzog & House, 1991; Kahn, 1986;
Myers, Manton, & Bacellar, 1986).
A second area of criticism of the disability model
has been that the emphasis on capabilities and diffi-
culties has the unintended effect of removing the in-
dividual from the social and physical context in which
functioning actually takes place. In this way, the mea-
surement of functional status has resulted in a de-
contextualized view of functioning in older adults. As
a result, there has been a tendency to de-emphasize
compensatory strategies, work-arounds, and the vari-
ous coping strategies employed by persons in their
home settings. Feinstein, Josephy, and Well (1996) re-
viewed forty three indices of functional disability
concluding that "... the most striking omission in in-
dexes of disability is the absence of attention to the
collaborative role of the patient.... With uncommon
exception, the roles of personal effort and external
support are constantly overlooked ..." (p. 414).
Conjugating the Tenses of Function:
Enacted Function Explained
According to Webster's dictionary, to conjugate a
verb is to "recite or display all or some subsets of
the inflected forms of a verb in a fixed order." The
conjugation of a verb describes the different forms
102 The Gerontologist
of action as they relate to the temporal context of
use. In linguistics, distinctions are drawn between
past, present, and future forms of verbs. For the
purpose of this article, a different type of conjuga-
tion is proposed in order to elucidate the meaning
of functioning for the field of aging. For the pur-
poses of this discussion, the idea of conjugation is
not used in its temporal meaning (past, present, and
future). Rather, the idea of conjugation refers to
different aspects of what might be termed "action
potential." The three tenses described below may
each exist in past, present, and future forms.
Figure 2 provides a typology of how the concept
of functioning might be conjugated in this manner.
Traditional measures of functional status, as a con-
sequence in part of the disability model, are primar-
ily examples of the hypothetical tense. Subjects are
asked a range of questions about whether they are
able to perform tasks, how difficult those tasks
might be, and whether they require help from peo-
ple or from assistive technologies. In each case, the
resulting answer is the product of the respondent's
abstract calculus based, presumably, on that sub-
ject's ability to average across situations and con-
texts. This calculation is most often unmeasured
and unobserved.
The second tense might be called the experimen-
tal tense in that instead of asking hypothetical ques-
tions about presumed ability, respondents are
asked to demonstrate functional capability in a clin-
ical (or experimental) setting. In the experimental
tense, respondents are asked to simulate activities
that are thought to be representative of true func-
tioning. As has been observed, this approach has
the advantage of offering direct observation of the
subject's ability and avoids some of the problems of
self-reports. However, while this tense may ade-
quately describe what a person is able to do under
the inspection of the clinical examiner, it tells us lit-
tle about the reality of that respondent's function-
ing at home. The experimental tense refers, then, to
the demonstrated performance of what is hypothet-
ically possible, albeit subject to the conditions and
limitations of the experimental setting.
A third tense, referred to here as the enacted
tense, refers neither to hypothetical ability nor to
what the individual is able to perform under special
and circumscribed conditions. Instead, enacted func-
tion refers to the functional performance realized
by an individual within the home context. Enacted
function, whether physical, cognitive, emotional or
social, refers to the end result of the confluence of
situational and ecological factors which shape the
moment to moment performance of functional tasks
in the real world. As such, enacted function is a lower
level of abstraction. It requires no abstract calculus
of what is possible, but requires instead the accurate
recollection of what has been or is now.
The central argument of this article is that within
the field of aging, the study of functioning has fo-
cused almost exclusively on just one tense. We
have conceptualized functioning in terms of the in-
dividual's capacity in the abstract, rather than what
that individual is doing now or has actually done in
the past. Researchers have constructed tests which
assess the capability or difficulty of certain actions,

but exclude the question of whether those actions
are actually performed. In short, a conceptual frame-
work has emerged within gerontology based on the
hypothetical rather than the enacted tense of func-
tion. Further, the predominant measurement tools
in common use in the field reflect and are driven by
this framework.
The usefulness of this approach to conceptualiz-
ing function is not to argue that any one perspec-
tive is inherently superior to the others. In fact, the
very quality that makes one tense better suited to
one application may be its weakness in another. For
example, Guralnik and colleagues (1989) correctly
assert that one advantage of performance-based
measures (experimental tense) over ADL scales (hy-
pothetical tense) is that the former are less influ-
enced by "cognition, culture, language, and educa-
tion." However, in another research context, these
same factors may be of primary interest. If an inves-
tigator wishes to research how factors such as lan-
guage, culture, education, cognition, social support,
or other host characteristics impact levels of func-
tional performance, measures based on either the
hypothetical or the experimental tense may be insuf-
ficient. All three tenses may represent different and
independent ways in which individuals think about
functioning. If that is true, gerontologists need to
develop parallel and complementary measurement
tools to accommodate those perspectives.
To a large extent, these alternatives already exist.
Any standard textbook on questionnaire design will
include a discussion of how question construction
impacts the resulting data that is generated (this
was pointed out by an anonymous reviewer of an
earlier draft of this paper). Research on functioning,
as well as public policy, however, continues to rely
almost exclusively on the hypothetical tense. Only
recently have attempts to further elucidate the ex-
perimental tense become widespread. Rarely has
this led to extensive investigation of the enacted
tense. The purpose of this article, moreover, is to
draw out the importance of the distinction among
the three, and to make a case for the importance of
the enacted tense.
Emphasis on the hypothetical tense has produced
considerable progress in the field. The ADL disabil-
ity scales were designed to capture gross depar-
tures from optimal functioning for purposes of pre-
dicting those at increased risk for nursing home
admission or death (Applegate, Blass, & Williams,
1990). Most of these scales, including Katz, the
Barthel index, and the original PULSES scales were
developed for use among hospitalized patients
(Wagner, 1987). In the hospital setting, the hypo-
thetical nature of these instruments is clearly more
appropriate; although as several commentators have
noted, the emphasis ought to shift to actual perfor-
mance of functional tasks as the patient moves from
the hospital to home (Fuhrer, 1987). As a predictor,
rather than as an outcome, the disability indices are
well suited to this task.
Traditional disability scales also have advantages
for public policy because they allow for the identifi-
cation of environmental barriers and impediments
more easily. As a basis for deciding who is eligible
for health or social services, it may be best to ex-
clude the contingencies of the home environment,
or at least to minimize their influence as a way of
ensuring equity in resource allocation. In this sense,
asking subjects if they are able to perform a task in
the hypothetical allows us to separate, or to hold
constant, the complexity which arises from the in-
troduction of the social, physical, and cultural con-
texts that shape and modify actual performance.
A Graphical Representation of Two Tenses
To further illustrate the importance of this distinc-
tion, Figure 3 depicts a simple 2-by-2 table which
contrasts the hypothetical tense (functional capac-
ity), as measured by most commonly used ADL
scales, with the enacted tense. Enacted function
refers to the extent and quality of functional perfor-
mance realized by an individual within a particular
socio-physical context. Individuals who fall on the
diagonal (Types I and IV) may be said to be concor-
dant between the hypothetical and enacted tenses
of functioning. For these individuals, ADL scales
would be valid and reliable measures of both func-
tional capability and actual performance. The term
actual performance here refers to functional perfor-
mance within a naturalistic social setting, as con-
trasted to performance achieved in a clinical setting
or under experimental conditions.
Types II and III, on the other hand, represent a
substantial measurement challenge that has seldom
been explicitly addressed in aging research. Type II
individuals enact high levels of functional perfor-
mance despite significant difficulty, disability, or di-
minished capacity. The reasons for this discordance
are many, and are not well understood. These indi-
viduals might be thought of as "over-achievers" in
the sense that within the context of their home envi-
ronment, they are functioning at a higher level than
that which they are presumed to be capable. Type III
individuals, on the other hand, actually function at

lower levels than would be predicted by ADL scales.
Despite the absence of limiting factors such as dis-
ease, impairments, or disability, these individuals do
not actually perform the tasks about which they are
being asked. These "under-achievers" may lead sed-
entary, immobile lives, and potentially are quite de-
pendent on others. Again, the reasons for this dis-
cordance are numerous.
Evidence from Previous Research
While a general awareness of this issue can be
seen throughout the literature on functioning, very
few investigators have studied the problem directly.
This author's own interest in this phenomenon was
catalyzed during qualitative interviews with surviving
members of the New Haven EPESE cohort. Among
them was a gentleman in his late 80s who reported a
high level of ADL impairment, yet spent most of his
days sailing his boat up and down the Connecticut
river. When asked about how he maintained the
boat, he demonstrated how he would use duct-tape
to affix a paint brush to his cane to apply a new coat
of paint to his boat every Spring. Equally common
was the story of a woman in her 70s who reported
that she was able to do everything for herself, while
maintaining that all she really did was watch televi-
sion all day while her 60 year old son with conges-
tive heart failure "waited on her hand-and-foot."
During these interviews, it became increasingly
clear that it is an error to assume that functional ca-
pacity and performance are the same.
Several commentators have noted the lack of
studies which investigate the reliability and validity
of functional disability measures in general (Mc-
Dowell & Newell, 1987). Beyond these general criti-
cisms, a number of researchers have noted a differ-
ence between functional capacity and performance
(Hickey, 1980; Jette, 1994; Kelly-Hayes, Jette, Wolf,
D'Agostino, & Odell, 1992; Patrick, Darby, Green,
Horton, Locker, & Wiggins, 1981; Verbrugge & Jette,
1994; Ziebland, Fitzpatrick, & jenkinson, 1993). For
example, some evidence suggests that those who re-
port impaired capacity in one or more domains are
simultaneously quite active and high-functioning in
other domains which are assumed to require high
degrees of capacity. In a study of religious participa-
tion among members of the New Haven EPESE co-
hort, Idler (1987) concludes that "... functional dis-
ability does not entirely determine behavior: 98 of
the sample's 358 severely disabled women (who re-
ported that they needed assistance in crossing a
room, feeding themselves, bathing, etc.) also report
a frequency of attendance at services of once a
week or more often." Miner, Logan, & Spitz (1993)
also found that functional disability is unrelated to
frequency of attending senior centers. Findings from
the Health Insurance Study (HIS) have shown that
some subjects who report limitations in physical
activity report no corresponding limitations in role
activities (Stewart, Ware, & Brook, 1981). In each
case, these findings were seen as anomalies, and
were not interpreted as signs of the weakness of a
more general model of functioning.
In their influential study of the correlation among
self-reported, interviewer-administered, and perfor-
mance-based testing of functional abilities, Reuben
et al. (1995) found the relationships to be "inconsis-
tent and weak, suggesting that these instruments
are not measuring the same construct." It is pos-
sible that differences between self-reports, inter-
views, and performance testing reflect more than
measurement error. They may also reflect differ-
ences in the meanings of different questions asked
in various ways. Several investigators have shown
that subjects will tend to interpret questions about
functioning in ways that are often different than
what researchers intend (Keller, Kovar, Jobe, &
Branch, 1993), and that the same subjects within the
same disease group, who are given different disabil-
ity questionnaires, will evidence substantially differ-
ent levels of disability (Ziebland et al., 1993). These
discrepancies may also reflect the inherent unrelia-
bility of asking questions in the hypothetical tense
(Anderson, Bush, & Berry, 1989). They also reflect, in
part, differences in the "tacit models" (Ziebland et
al., 1993) which underlie the construction of disabil-
ity instruments.
The few studies that have examined multiple
tenses suggest that reduced function in the enacted
tense may be more prevalent than is observed in
the hypothetical tense (Type III discordance). In a
recent study, Kelly-Hayes et al. (1992) used Nagi's
distinction between functional limitation (capacity)
and disability (closest to enacted) to look at data
from the Framingham study. Their findings suggest
substantial discrepancies between the two and, in
most cases in which differences were observed, re-
spondents reported a disability (enacted tense) and
not a functional limitation (hypothetical tense). In
addition, they found that psychosocial factors were
more strongly associated with disabilities than they
were with limitations. This last finding is important
because it suggests that the impact of psychosocial
factors may be greater in determining the enacted
rather than hypothetical tense of function. This ob-
servation is supported by Mendes de Leon et al.
(1996) who studied both the experimental tense
(physical performance) and the hypothetical tense
(ADL questions) over time and found the relation-
ship to be mediated by self-efficacy.
In another study, Patrick et al. (1981) looked at
data from two community surveys of a London bor-
ough and found considerable differences across the
two waves based on what they termed "capacity
wording" versus "performance wording" of their
disability questions. In the study that used the per-
formance wording (enacted tense), investigators
found as much as a two-fold increase in the preva-
lence of disability, leading the authors to suggest
that studies based on capacity wording may sub-
stantially under-estimate the true prevalence of dis-
ability in populations. A similar conclusion was
reached by Anderson et al. (1989) who found that
"capacity wording" of questions produced an under-
reporting of dysfunction of at least 10%. Based on
the studies by Patrick, Kelly-Hayes, Anderson, and
Vol. 38, No. 1,1998 105
others, it is likely that discrepancies between the
two tenses of function may be substantial, and that
reliance exclusively on instruments which assess
only the hypothetical tense may lead to biased esti-
mates of disability rates as well as an underestima-
tion of the importance of psychosocial factors in
late-life functioning.
Three Examples of Discordance: Data From
the MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging
We now turn to an empirical example that illus-
trates the importance of what has been argued so far.
In order to estimate the magnitude of discordance
between reported capacity and actual functional per-
formance, we would ideally choose data that were
drawn from a randomly chosen and community-
based study of the elderly. We would hope to have
indicators of functional capacity and enacted func-
tioning that would be sensitive to higher-level activ-
ities as well as gross impairments and disability in
the physical domains. And, we would hope for mea-
sures of both capacity and actual performance that
were directly observed or performance based (on
both counts) rather than self-reports alone. Data
that meet all of these criteria are currently unavail-
able. However, for the purpose of illustration, data
from the MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging
have several important advantages. First, although
not intentional, the MacArthur battery asked two
sets of questions about several domains of function
in both the hypothetical and enacted tenses. First,
traditional functional disability questions were
asked about the extent to which the respondent
feels that they are able to accomplish a task. Then,
much later in the interview, under items which are
part of a battery of productive activity questions,
subjects were asked whether and how often those
same tasks were actually performed. These data
then afford the opportunity to explore the extent of
discordance between the hypothetical and the en-
acted tenses of functioning. It should be stressed
that while these data offer a rich opportunity to esti-
mate the magnitude of concordance or discor-
dance, the MacArthur study was not designed to
investigate this question and there are several no-
table limitations associated with these data. For ex-
ample, both sets of questions are self-reports and
are therefore subject to the problems associated
therewith.
Aging researchers have begun to study produc-
tive activities -- or those activities which generate
goods and services of economic value -- as a marker
of "successful" aging (Cutler & Danigelis, 1993;
Class et al., 1995; Herzog, Antonucci, Jackson, Kahn,
& Morgan, 1987). For the purpose of this study,
questions about productive activity are good indica-
tors of enacted functioning because they ask the
frequency and duration of routine activities as they
were actually performed. Productive activity is also
an ideal indicator of global enacted functioning be-
cause it represents high-level functioning which re-
quires performance in the social, physical, and cog-
nitive domains.
Methods
Subjects
The data used in these analyses are from the
MacArthur Research Network on Successful Aging
Field Study, a longitudinal study of high func-
tioning men and women aged 70-79. Details of the
study design are available elsewhere (Berkman,
Seeman, Blazer, Kahn, Mohs, Finch, Schneider, Cot-
man, McClearn, Nesselroade, Featherman, Gar-
mezy, McKhann, Brim, Pragar, & Rowe, 1993). Sub-
jects were drawn from three sites of the Established
Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the El-
derly (EPESE): Durham, NC; East Boston, MA; and
New Haven, CT. Men and women aged 70-79 were
selected on the basis of physical and cognitive func-
tion at the time of their 1988 EPESE interview. Age-
eligible men and women (N = 4,030) were screened
on the basis of six criteria to identify a relatively
"high functioning" cohort, representing approxi-
mately the top third of their age peers in terms of
physical and cognitive function. Of the 1,313 sub-
jects who met all criteria, 1,192 (90.8%) agreed to
participate and provided informed consent. Base-
line data collection was completed between May
1988 and December 1989 and included a ninety
minute, face-to-face interview covering detailed as-
sessments of physical and cognitive performance as
well as information regarding health status. A three
year follow-up interview was conducted in 1991.
However, this study uses only data from the base-
line interview.
For comparison purposes, a smaller subsample of
subjects was interviewed at baseline (n = 163) who
were chosen to represent the middle and low ter-
tiles of functioning using the same criteria. This
group was chosen to permit comparisons with the
high functioning subjects in order to determine
those physical and psychosocial factors that dis-
criminate "successful" from "usual" patterns of
aging. The medium and low functioning groups
were not re-interviewed at follow-up.
Measures
Features of the data collection and sampling stra-
tegies for the EPESE studies have been well de-
scribed regarding sociodemographic characteristics
(Cornoni-Huntley, Ostfeld, Taylor, Wallace, Blazer,
Berkman, Evans, Kohout, Lemke, Scherr, & Korper,
1993). Variables used in these analyses include age,
sex, race, and marital status. Age was recorded as of
the date of the subject's 1988 MacArthur interview,
and is dichotomized in these analyses (0 = 70-74,
1 = 75-79). Marital status is also dichotomized (1 if
married at baseline, 0 if not).
Our objective in this study was to cross-classify
indicators of functioning across two distinct tenses.
To accomplish this goal within the limitations of the
MacArthur data, three comparisons were made
using data from questions both about hypothetical
and enacted tenses. Functional disability scales in-
cluded in the MacArthur battery include a 7-item

(Rosow & Breslau, 1966), all of which use wording
that reflects the hypothetical tense. Among high-
functioning respondents, there was no variance on
the Katz ADL index, and only limited variance on
the Nagi and Rosow-Breslau scales (see Appendix,
Note 2).
First, we focused on two items from the Rosow-
Breslau index which include: 1) "Are you able to do
heavy housework like washing windows, walls, or
floors without help?" [coded yes, no, or refused];
and 2) "Are you able to walk 1/2 mile without help?"
[coded yes, no, and refused]. For the third compari-
son, summary indices of potential versus enacted
tenses were used, including self-reported limita-
tions in ability to function in either the Nagi and the
Rosow-Breslau scales and a summary index of pro-
ductive activities (enacted tense).
To measure enacted function, or the level of
functional performance as realized by each subject
in their home, 18 items from the productive activi-
ties battery developed by the MacArthur Successful
Aging network in conjunction with colleagues from
the Americans Changing Lives study (Herzog, Kahn,
Morgan, Jackson, & Antonucci, 1989). For our first
two comparisons, individual items from the produc-
tive activity battery which paralleled items from the
Rosow-Breslau scale were used, including questions
which asked "Do you currently do any heavy house-
work?" and "Do you walk at least 1/2 city block per
day?" [both items coded yes, no, refuses, don't
know]. For the third comparison, a summary index
of productive activities developed in an earlier
study was used (Glass et al., 1995). This scale com-
bines information on five dimensions of productive
activity chosen to represent the activities commonly
engaged in by older people which produce eco-
nomic goods or services including: 1) housework, 2)
yard work, 3) child care, 4) paid work, and 5) volun-
teer work. In the present study, the summary index
was divided into tertiles for the high-functioning
group, as well as the medium- to low-fuctioning
comparison group.
pothetical and enacted function are presented in
Tables 2, 3, and 4. In Table 2, the ability to perform
heavy housework is cross-tabulated with the actual
performance of heavy housework. Note that the
data are presented for the high-functioning group
(HF) and the medium- to low-functioning group
(MLF) separately. Only 6% of the HF group say they
are not able to do heavy housework. Of that group,

Results
Table 1 shows the socioeconomic and selected
functional characteristics of the two in total as well
as by gender. In comparing the high-functioning
sample (labeled successful agers in the MacArthur
study) to the medium- to low-functioning group
(usual agers), the high-functioning group, as ex-
pected, is younger, less likely to be of minority de-
scent and less cognitively impaired. With the ex-
ception of a difference in education among women,
the two groups are not notably different in educa-
tion or income. Among the high-functioning group,
women were more likely to be married. In both
groups, just over half (55%) of the sample is female.
The results of the three comparisons between hy-

Approximately one-third of the sample of both
high- and low-functioning groups report hypotheti-
cal and enacted tenses which are consistent with
one another. Again, however, our focus is on the
off-diagonal cells of the Table. Among those HF
who report 1-2 functional limitations, nearly one
third (27%) performed in the highest tertile of pro-
ductive activity. Similarly, among those with no limi-
tations, 30% are in the lowest tertile of productivity.
Among medium- to low-functioning respondents,
31% are in the highest tertile of productivity despite
reporting three or more functional limitations. Fi-
nally, 28% of those with no limitations are among
the least productive subjects.

however, 60% report later in the questionnaire that
they do perform heavy housework. Among the MLF
group, just over half say they are not able to do
heavy housework, while 38% of that group reports
that they do heavy housework. Conversely, among
those who said that they were able to do heavy
housework, 7% of the HF group and 23% of the MLF
group reported that they, in fact, did not do any
heavy housework.
Table 3 presents results of a similar analysis for
walking. In this case, the wording of the two ques-
tions was not exactly the same. Here we contrast
those who said they were or were not able to walk
one-half mile without help, with those who walk at
least one-half city block per day. Among the HF
group, only 3% said they were not able to walk one-
half mile without help. Among that group of 37 re-
spondents, 65% said they walk one-half city block
per day. Among the MLF group, 40% of those who
said they are not able to walk one-half mile, re-
ported that they did walk at least one-half city block
each day. Among those who said they are able to
walk one-half mile, nearly one-quarter walk less
than one-half city block per day.
Finally, Table 4 presents a similar analysis which
looks at any self-reported impairment in the hypo-
thetical tense with a summary index of enacted
function. We contrast those who report 0 versus 1-2
versus 3 or more functional limitations (Nagi or
Rosow-Breslau), with the index of productive activi-
ties broken into tertiles. In first looking at the diago-
nal cells of the Table, a consistent pattern is visible.
Discussion
The purpose of presenting these data has been to
call attention to the possibility of substantial dis-
cordance between answers to questions about func-
tional capacity and actual performance in the home
context. A thorough and comprehensive examina-
tion of this discordance is beyond the scope of these
data and this study. These data are clearly not with-
out limits. However, although others have pointed
out the importance of question design in studies of
functional status (Anderson, Bush, & Berry, 1989;
Hickey, 1980; Kovar, 1991; Robine, Michel, & Branch,
1992), few investigators have taken seriously the idea
that functional performance may be as important as
functional capacity. In the absence of better data,
these analyses suggest a relatively consistent picture.
Across multiple comparisons, the degree of discor-
dance between hypothetical and enacted tenses of
function appears to be between the range of 25%
and 35%. That is, many older persons appear to be
both overachieving and underachieving in their
functional performance relative to self-reports of
functional capacity as measured by standard in-
dices. This discordance appears to be relatively
symmetrical in that the magnitude of overachieving
roughly matches the magnitude of underachieving.
This suggests that failure to include separate assess-
ments of performance may lead to considerable
misclassification and measurement error.
Why Does This Matter?
Is the distinction between hypothetical, experi-
mental, and enacted tenses simply a linguistic trick,
or are the implications of this argument important?
Is there anything here beyond simple measurement
error? In the remainder of this discussion, eight rea-
sons for the significance and importance of this
phenomenon are presented.
Missing Information. -- Social and behavioral sci-
entists have increasingly moved toward a broader
and richer conception of aging. The new themes
have been heterogeneity, fluidity, adaptation, modi-
fiability, and "successful aging" (Berkman, 1988;
Maddox, 1987; Rowe & Kahn, 1987). From large-scale
epidemiological data sets, much has been learned
108 The Gerontologist
about the plasticity of human aging. Old notions of
aging as an inevitable process of decline and loss
of capacity are being replaced. Many of these ideas
confirm and reiterate the conventional wisdom that
as we age, the mind matters. Regrettably, the devel-
opment of new multidimensional instruments for
the assessment of global functioning in all its facets
has lagged behind. Instead, aging researchers have
relied on measures designed in the 1960s largely for
clinical purposes, which are based almost exclu-
sively on the hypothetical tense. Designed to cap-
ture the physiological substrata underlying func-
tional status, these instruments have been less
successful at capturing how elderly people are actu-
ally functioning in their daily lives. As a result, a rig-
orous assessment and subsequent investigation of
the contribution of psychosocial factors to function-
ing has been lacking. A new sensitivity to the impor-
tance of multiple tenses of functioning is needed as
well as new and innovative tools for disaggregating
those tenses.
Will the Real Disability Please Stand Up? - It is
widely recognized that the definition and measure-
ment of disability has a profound impact on the
rates of disability observed in a given population.
For example, Jette (1994) shows that wording based
on "difficulty" as opposed to the need for "human
assistance" resulted in disability estimates that were
1.2 to 5 times greater. Given the importance of
wording, it may be especially important to measure
actual performance of self-care tasks independently
of difficulties and help, both human and non-human.
And while some studies clearly focus appropriately
on the identification of impairments at the hypo-
thetical tense, it may be equally important to begin
to recognize that what really matters most, both in
relation to quality of life, and as a true marker of un-
derlying risk of poor outcome, is not what people
can do, but what they do do.
Evaluation of Interventions: A Better Mousetrap.
-- The main goal of health interventions is the opti-
mization or restoration of the actual, functional per-
formance of life activities. As Kane and Kane (1987)
observe, "If long-term care is directed at improving
or maintaining functioning, then its success can be
measured by functional outcomes" (p. 107). Yet, our
evaluation tools often pertain only to whether help
is needed, not whether it is received; whether diffi-
culties are encountered, not whether they are over-
come; and whether performance is possible, not
whether it is achieved. By definition, outcome mea-
sures which tap into performance will be more ap-
propriate and definitive than those that ask only
about the hypothetical ability to function. The re-
verse is also true. As observed by Anderson et al.
(1989), "Treatment programs should not take credit
(and resources) for restoring function that does not
exist." (p. 15). Interventions which do not translate
reductions in capacity into corresponding incre-
ments in performance are clearly less effective than
those that do.
In addition, interventions targeted at the enacted
tense may require different strategies and ap-
proaches. As the work of Mendes de Leon and others
have shown (Mendes de Leon, Fillenbaum, Williams,
Brock, Beckett, & Berkman, 1995), attention to issues
such as self-efficacy may be necessary in order to
translate the benefits of increased capacity into the
ultimate goal of increased function as realized in the
residential context.
The Underestimation of Life-Context -- In addi-
tion to the survey data shown here, this research is
based on in-depth interviews conducted by the au-
thor in an effort to determine the meanings of vari-
ous types of questions about functioning and their
relation to quality of life in late life. As a conse-
quence of this qualitative work, it became increas-
ingly clear that functional performance is substan-
tially shaped by the social and cultural context of
the home-world and that functioning cannot be un-
derstood in the absence of that context (Class, 1991;
Keith, 1985,1988). However, because aging research
has relied so heavily on large-scale survey studies
that include little information about that social con-
text data, it is perhaps not surprising that the field
has tended to underestimate its importance (Kasl,
1995). By integrating qualitative data collected in
naturalistic settings with large scale survey data, a
level of richness and insight can be achieved which
is lacking when either type of data is examined
alone. In many interviews, subjects answered ques-
tions about the hypothetical tense, then gave much
different answers when asked to describe what they
actually did. There exists a need for more qualitative
studies of functioning in the real world which ex-
plore explicitly the different tenses of function and
how discrepancies are understood as meaningful by
older persons.
Compensatory Strategies. -- Aging specialists have
long recognized that older persons cope differ-
ently, and vary in their use of compensatory strate-
gies and technologies in dealing with the challenges
of late life. The concept of compensation is particu-
larly important for identifying factors which help
disabled persons overcome those challenges and
avoid the handicaps that can result. Forms of com-
pensation might include substitution of goals, slower
timetables, help from equipment or from others,
environmental modification, avoidance of hazard,
or even greater effort. The concept of compensa-
tion is appealing if for no other reason than it casts
the disabled person in a heroic light. However, to
the extent that enacted function is not measured in-
dependently of the hypothetical tense, it becomes
nearly impossible to fully explore the impact of these
compensatory strategies. It may be argued that the
discordance observed in these data represents little
more than the effects of these various strategies
(i.e., help from people or specialized equipment).
Certainly the need to perform productive activities
depends on more than the ability to do so, but also
on the need to produce as dictated by one's socioe-
Vol. 38, No. 1,1998 109
conomic resources. It is possible that the failure to
measure the two tenses separately has led to a sys-
tematic myopia, whereby the real importance and
significance of those types of help may be substan-
tially underestimated.
Determinants of Under and Over Achievement. --
It is not a novel observation that some elders seem
to overcome seemingly extraordinary challenges,
while others appear to be devastated by only minor
disabilities (Hickey, 1980). This observation should be
obvious and compelling to clinicians, as it is to any-
one who has known a "super" grandparent. How-
ever, the disability model, which ends with handicap,
leaves off prior to the endpoint of actual perfor-
mance within broad fuctional domains. As such, we
currently lack the tools, both methodologically and
conceptually, to study those factors most closely as-
sociated with these two discordant types. What are
the factors that are associated with overcoming im-
pairments among those living in the community?
What are the factors which are associated with low
levels of enacted function, despite the relative ab-
sence of disease or disability? This may be an espe-
cially important risk group as is indicated by studies
showing the deleterious consequences of inactivity
(Hartley, 1985; Kannel, Belanger, D'Agostino, & Israel,
1986; Kiely, Wolf, Cupples, Beiser, & Kannel, 1994; Lee
& Markides, 1990; Leon, 1985; Paffenbarger, Hyde,
Wing, & Hsieh, 1986; Simonsick, Lafferty, Phillips,
Mendes, Kasl, Seeman, Fillenbaum, Hebert, & Lemke,
1993). By developing new tools for the assessment of
enacted function, the capability to address these
questions will be substantially enhanced.
Differential Discordance Across Age Categories.
-- There is evidence that the discrepancies between
hypothetical and enacted tenses may be greater in
older people than in younger people. That is, mea-
sures based on the hypothetical tense alone may
be especially poor markers of actual functioning in
older populations, therefore leading to unwarranted
conclusions about the prevalence of dysfunction. For
example, in a study of stroke recovery Ferrucci and
his colleagues (Ferrucci, Bandinelli, Guralnik, Lam-
poni, Berttini, Falchini, & Baroni, 1993) looked at the
relation between motor impairment (an index of
functional capability as it relates to the stroke's sever-
ity) and functional performance (measured using the
Barthel Index of ADL). Their findings, based on a
prospective study of 50 first-time stroke survivors,
show that motor impairment predicts most of the
recovery that is observed among younger people
(<65), while older subjects were "more likely to em-
ploy compensatory strategies to overcome some of
the neural impairment that remains after stroke" (p.
200). Older persons kept pace with the recovery of
younger persons in terms of enacted function, de-
spite demonstrating significantly less improvement
at the motor level. Studies such as this one suggest
that the need to look at enacted and hypothetical
function independently may be more acute among
the oldest old.
A Strategy for Measuring Successful Aging. -- Re-
search in aging over the last decade has emphasized
population heterogeneity and a widening of the
scope of factors thought to determine functioning
(Maddox, 1979, 1987). The distinction between "suc-
cessful," "normal," and "pathological" patterns of
aging is now widely recognized (Baltes & Baltes, 1990;
Berkman, 1988; Roos & Havens, 1981; Rowe & Kahn,
1987; Rudinger & Thomae, 1990). Yet, the concept of
successful aging has not been fully translated into
operational measures and testable hypotheses, with
some notable exceptions. The distinction between
hypothetical and enacted function may be a key to
further specifying (and measuring) the mechanisms
underlying successful aging. In this study, discrep-
ancies were observed between what respondents
say they are able to do, and how they actually per-
form. The observation of these discrepancies is
especially important among a cohort of older sub-
jects who were selected to be homogeneous and
high-functioning. Many of the psychosocial factors
that have been linked with successful aging includ-
ing social networks and supports, resiliency, per-
sonality characteristics, motivation, and self-efficacy
may be more closely associated with enacted func-
tion than with its more hypothetical forms. A new
method of measuring enacted function will create
additional avenues for the empirical study of suc-
cessful aging beyond what has yet been achieved.
Conclusions and Implications
This article has proposed a conceptual model to
describe and understand differences between func-
tional capacity and actual functional performance in
the home. Although the importance of the wording
of survey questions is commonly recognized, the
development and implementation of new measures
of enacted function have lagged. Cerontological re-
search has remained focused on standard measures
of function which are limited to the assessment of
capability (hypothetical tense). The absence of inde-
pendent measurement of the separate tenses of
function may lead to misclassification of risk, mea-
surement error, and a gap in research on the im-
portance of psychosocial factors and compensatory
strategies. It has been argued that the distinction
among hypothetical, experimental and enacted func-
tion is more than semantic, and more than a techni-
cal detail of question design, but addresses the
ways in which the field of aging has tended to con-
ceptualize functioning and how the history of the
field informs our understanding of that conceptual-
ization. Several empirical examples were provided
from the MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging
which suggest a consistent pattern of substantial
discordance between the hypothetical and enacted
tenses of functioning. The full extent of, and expla-
nations for, these discrepancies remain poorly un-
derstood and, in large part, masked by the concepts
and measures currently in wide use.
The implications of this argument for researchers,
interventionists, and policy makers are potentially
110 The Gerontologist
far-reaching. Research is needed to compare inde-
pendent assessments of the three tenses of function.
This will require the development of additional mea-
surement tools specifically designed to capture en-
acted function to complement established methods
for the assessment of disability (hypothetical tense)
and physical performance (experimental tense).
Measures of enacted function could be developed in
both self-report and observer-rated formats. In ei-
ther case, these new measures must be designed to
capture functional performance in the home setting,
and must be sensitive to both the frequency and du-
ration of functional performance. These new mea-
sures may be quite useful for designers of interven-
tions. As an outcome, enacted function can be used
to assess the efficacy of interventions more precisely
because in tapping actual performance, rather than
just capability, they capture the complex influences
of the social and physical milieu, all of which are rel-
evant to the ultimate efficacy of any intervention. In
the policy domain, many programs utilize standard
ADL scales to determine eligibility, despite evidence
which suggests that "capacity wording" leads to un-
derestimation of the true extent of functional diffi-
culties (Anderson, Bush, & Berry, 1989; Kelly-Hayes et
al., 1992; Patrick et al., 1981). The addition of separate
measures of enacted function would allow for more
valid and reliable estimation of true disability in pop-
ulations, and would lead to the identification of
under-served groups. Finally, dual assessments of
hypothetical and enacted function will identify the
prevalence of discrepant patterns II and III (over-
and under-achieving) which constitute, in one case,
an important new category of risk and, in the other
case, an important new phenomenon for study. In
short, much can be learned from those individuals
for whom assessments of how they might function
and how they do function do not coincide.

Notes
1. There are minor differences in the language used by
different authors in the disability tradition. Where Nagi
uses the terms "disability" and "handicap" (Nagi, 1965),
Verbrugge and Jette use instead the terms "functional
limitations" and "disability" (Verbrugge & Jette, 1994).
2. Subjects were considered to be high-functioning if
they met several criteria including a) no disability on
the Katz ADL scale, b) not more than one disability
item on either the Rosow-Breslau or Nagi scales of
gross mobility and physical performance, and c) a
score of 6 or higher on the 9-item test of cognitive per-
formance developed by Pfieffer.
