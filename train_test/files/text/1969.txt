Abstract
While researchers have developed more effec-
tive programs and strategies to prevent the
initiation of substance use and increasingly
communities are delivering these interventions,
determining the degree to which they are deliv-
ered as they were designed remains a significant
research challenge. In the past several years,
more attention has been given to implementa-
tion issues during the various stages of program
development and diffusion. This paper presents
the findings from a substudy of an evaluation of
a newly designed middle and high school sub-
stance abuse prevention program, Take Charge
of Your Life delivered by local Drug Abuse
Resistance Education officer instructors. A key
aspect of the study was to determine the extent
to which implementation fidelity, using the
measures of content coverage and appropriate
instructional strategy, was associated with im-
provement in the program mediators of real-
istic normative beliefs, understanding the
harmful effects of substance use and the acqui-
sition of decision-making and resistance skills.
Although it was found that higher fidelity was
associated with better scores on some of the
mediators, this was not a consistent finding.
The mixed results are discussed within the con-
text of the lesson activities themselves.
Introduction
The March 2004 issue of Prevention Science in-
cluded a number of articles based on presentations
given at a conference jointly sponsored by the Na-
tional Institute on Drug Abuse and the Center for
Substance Abuse Prevention entitled, `What Do
Schools Really Think about Prevention Research?
Blending Research and Reality' [1]. The authors of
these papers listed challenges to the progress of
prevention science including dissemination and dif-
fusion of strategies found to be effective through
rigorous designs and resultant concerns about
implementation fidelity and adaptation [2­4].
The concern about implementation fidelity and
adaptation or reinvention is based on the results
of national studies which found that evidence- or
research-based programs taken `to scale' at the com-
munity level often are not implemented as they were
designed and evaluated. Two recent national studies
conducted in 1997 and 1999 indicate that although
many schools are meeting mandates to implement
evidence-based prevention programs, they are not
doing so with fidelity. Hallfors and Godette [5]
found in their survey of Safe and Drug Free School
Coordinators, located in 104 school districts in
12 states, that only 19% were implementing curric-
ulum with fidelity. In another study of staff who
taught substance abuse prevention in a nationally
representative sample of 1795 public and private
schools, Ennett et al. [6] found that 62.2% taught
effective content which included social influence or
comprehensive life skills materials and activities
and 17.4% used effective interactive delivery meth-
ods. Only 14.2% reported using effective content
materials, activities and delivery methods [6].

Although fidelity of implementation is recog-
nized as important [7,8], few studies have exam-
ined the relationship between level of fidelity and
program outcomes. Tobler and Stratton [9] sug-
gest that decreases in the effect sizes they found in
their meta-analysis of school-based substance
abuse prevention programs taken to scale may
be due to implementation issues. Pentz and
Trebow [10] found that children exposed to a pro-
gram delivered by instructors who maintained
high implementation fidelity had better outcomes
than those exposed to the program delivered by
instructors who implemented the program with
low fidelity. Furthermore, children exposed to
the program delivered by low implementers had
better outcomes than children in the control con-
dition. Botvin et al. [11] found that children
who experienced 60% of the program had better
outcomes compared with the control children.
Hansen et al. [12] found that program integrity
(the term used for fidelity) was significantly re-
lated to three of seven program mediators for a re-
sistance skills program. While in a later pilot study
of the All Stars Community Program, Hansen
et al. [13] found that instruction with higher pro-
gram fidelity had better outcomes.
As the field of prevention continues to dis-
seminate theory- and research-based interventions,
the combined issues of fidelity and reinvention
will become increasingly important. However, as
Dusenbury et al. [14] emphasize, although the field
has fair agreement on the definition of fidelity (`.
the degree to which teachers and other program
providers implement programs as intended by the
program developers'. p. 240), there does not appear
to be consensus regarding the specific dimensions
of fidelity nor of their measurements. The authors
list the five most frequently mentioned definitions
as `. (1) strict adherence to methods or implemen-
tation that conforms to theoretical guidelines ., (2)
completeness and dosage of implementation, (3)
the quality of program delivery (the way a teacher
implements a program), (4) the degree to which
participants are engaged and (5) program differen-
tiation (the degree to which elements which would
distinguish one type of program from another are
present or absent)' (p. 240). As variable as the def-
initions of fidelity are, their measures remain even
more complex [15­22].
It is appropriate to point out that assessing
implementation fidelity or adherence to the design
and intent of an intervention is important during
every phase of development from efficacy trials
through to replication studies to assure that the
research results can be related to the intervention
and not to other factors. The most effective pre-
ventive interventions available today are based
on strong theoretical or conceptual frameworks.
These frameworks specify not only the targets
for the intervention such as normative beliefs or
skills building but also the processes and mecha-
nisms through which participants of the interven-
tion integrate and internalize desired attitudes and
behaviors. Of particular importance is measuring
the degree to which a newly developed interven-
tion achieves both short- and long-term objectives
as through mediational analyses and to assess ad-
herence to delivery style, coverage of materials
and participant involvement in the intervention
processes. For this reason, for instance, in efficacy
studies, investigators control the training and de-
livery of the intervention. As one moves along the
developmental phases to field trials or replication
studies, where delivery is less well controlled,
investigators need to assess the extent to which
the intervention is delivered as designed, how
the deliverer may alter any component of the in-
tervention and what impact revisions may have on
the intervention's outcomes.
The purpose of this paper is to present findings
regarding the association of implementation fidel-
ity and the targeted mediators of a substance
abuse prevention program, Take Charge of Your
Life (TCYL) delivered to students when they
are in the seventh and ninth grades by Drug
Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) officers.
Implementation fidelity data were collected by
specially trained independent observers using
standardized forms. Data for the program's tar-
geted mediators come from student surveys com-
pleted at seven points in time over the 5-year
study period.

Background
The Adolescent Substance Abuse
Prevention Study
The evaluation
The Adolescent Substance Abuse Prevention Study
(ASAPS) funded by the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation and conducted by a research team at
The University of Akron is designed to assess the
impact of a substance abuse prevention program
with components delivered to students when they
are in the seventh and ninth grades (TCYL). The
program was delivered by D.A.R.E. officers. The
study was conducted in 83 school districts (with 83
clusters of high schools and their 122 feeder middle
schools) located in six metropolitan areas (Detroit,
Houston, Los Angeles, Newark, New Orleans and
St Louis) and began in the 2001­02 school year
with a cohort of seventh graders who were surveyed
through the 11th grade year school districts in the
inner city and other districts within a 50-mile radius
around the inner city district were randomly se-
lected and then recruited to participate in the study.
Once letters stating agreement to participate in the
study were received from district superintendents,
school principals and police departments within the
respective jurisdiction, school clusters were ran-
domly assigned to receive the TCYL curriculum
or to continue with the substance abuse prevention
program in place in their school, to provide a new
program or not to provide any program at all. Forty-
two high schools and their 63 feeder middle schools
were assigned to the control condition while 41
high schools and their 59 feeder middle schools
were assigned to the treatment condition. At base-
line, 19 200 seventh graders with positive parental
consents and student assents (56.3% of those con-
sidered eligible from school rosters at the beginning
of the 2001­02 school year) participated in the
study. Of these, 11 118 attended the treatment
schools and 8082 attended the control schools.
Students completed self-administered surveys in
a classroom setting at seven time points: at baseline,
after the seventh grade intervention in the treatment
schools and ;60 to 90 days after the baseline sur-
vey in the control schools, ;1 year later when stu-
dents were in the eighth grade, prior to and after the
delivery of the ninth grade TCYL curriculum in
the treatment schools and about the same time in
the control schools, ;1 year later when students
were in the 10th grade and, finally, when students
were in the 11th grade. All surveys were adminis-
tered by the research staff; no school personnel or
D.A.R.E. officer instructors were present during sur-
vey administration.
The curriculum
TCYL draws heavily from both education and sub-
stance abuse prevention research and emphasizes
normative beliefs about the prevalence and social
acceptability of the use of tobacco, alcohol, inha-
lants, marijuana and other drugs (ATOD); the per-
ceptions of the consequences associated with the
use of these substances and the acquisition of social
skills including communication skills, decision-
making skills and resistance strategies. The pro-
gram is designed to address ATOD use through
a series of scenarios representing problem situations
which were drawn from focus groups of middle and
high school students. The seventh grade curriculum
consists of 10 lessons and the ninth grade curricu-
lum includes seven lessons.
The program content is intertwined throughout
the lessons to help students form an understanding
of the risks involved when substances are used,
particularly by young people whose bodies and
brains are still developing. The lesson content also
supports students' understanding that most adoles-
cents do not use ATOD on a regular basis and
provides opportunities for students to practice the
social and communication skills that enable them to
resist the use of substances.
The program fosters interaction and active learn-
ing through large and small group discussions and
role-play to stimulate students to `try on' and think
through problematic situations guided by the
D.A.R.E. officer instructors. The program's spiral
structure allows concepts and skills to be revisited
throughout the lessons such that the skills are in-
troduced, revisited and practiced in increasingly
more complex problem situations.

Homework is provided so that students can fur-
ther refine the skills and understandings being de-
veloped in the classroom and to keep parents fully
informed about the lessons and their students'
work. Follow-up in-class sessions weave the home-
work and class activities into a meaningful se-
quence of learning activities.
Training of instructors
The training of instructors to understand, to em-
brace and to teach the seventh grade curriculum
occurred in the fall of 2001 and for the ninth grade
curriculum in late August of 2003. Officers who
participated in the training consisted of D.A.R.E.
officers who were available to serve the study
school districts. In a few instances where local
law enforcement agencies did not have a D.A.R.E.
program, D.A.R.E. officers were recruited from
nearby agencies. The study paid for all travel
expenses associated with the training. Salaries for
the D.A.R.E. officers during training were paid by
their local agencies or by D.A.R.E. America. There
were a total of six 3-day sessions with 67 officers
receiving training for the seventh grade curriculum
and three 3-day sessions with 73 officers in training
for the ninth grade curriculum. Instructors were
given a curriculum manual which included not only
the curriculum but also the information and resour-
ces covering tobacco, alcohol and other drugs and
their effects and describing the purpose, rationale,
as well as developmental criteria of the curriculum.
In addition, training consisted of teaching each of
the lessons, demonstrating how to teach the lessons
and practicing the lessons in a simulated setting
with fellow officers serving as `students'. All offi-
cers had been trained previously by D.A.R.E.
America in the D.A.R.E. elementary curriculum
and all officers signed consent forms agreeing to
being observed in the classroom.
The principal philosophy of the training was that
officers would best understand and be able to teach
the program if they had ample opportunities to have
significant dialog about the design of the curricu-
lum and content of each lesson, to observe demon-
strations by colleagues as to how the lessons are
intended to be taught and to teach each of the les-
sons and receive instructive feedback about their
teaching.
Careful planning and instruction were taken into
consideration when training the instructors as the
new curriculum, TCYL, employs instructional
strategies which are quite different from those em-
phasized by D.A.R.E. America in prior curricula.
The officers were being asked to make a switch
from a curriculum which required a more didactic
approach to one more highly interactive, from one
which was instructor focused to being student fo-
cused and to one which allows time to practice and
master resistance skills. Moreover, the curriculum
team emphasized the importance of understanding
the curriculum design and theory to be effective
instructors of this new curriculum.
As the curriculum design and structure were key
components to the success of the program, a sub-
study was incorporated into the evaluation to assess
the extent to which the officer instructors imple-
mented the program as they were trained to do.
There was particular concern regarding the high
reliance on interactive and constructivist instruc-
tional style which was counter to the officer instruc-
tors' prior training and experience that was less
interactive [23]. In addition, the research staff and
curriculum developers wanted to know if there was
an association between fidelity of implementation
and achievement of the aims of each lesson.
Methods
Implementation fidelity study
In the ASAPS, fidelity included multiple dimen-
sions including content coverage, use of appropri-
ate instructional strategy, the expected responsive
behaviors of the students and time on task. For this
paper, the focus will be on content coverage and
use of appropriate instructional strategy. The de-
cision to focus on these measures is in part guided
by the findings from studies discussed above by
Hallfors and Ennett and their colleagues that
addressed content and use of interactive instruc-
tional methods.
Implementation fidelity
397
In this paper, we utilize the observation data
from the substudy above and data from student
surveys to address the following two questions:
(i) to what extent do the officer instructors cover
all the material and activities in the program lessons
and use the appropriate instructional strategies to
deliver the lesson components and (ii) do students
exposed to officer instructors who deliver the les-
son content with fidelity and who adhere to the
appropriate instructional strategies have better
scores on the lesson mediators than those who are
exposed to officer instructors with lower levels of
fidelity and adherence.
Sample
Although 140 officers were trained to deliver the
new curricula, 86 officers actually taught TCYL. Of
these, 58 taught the seventh grade curriculum and
61 taught the ninth grade curriculum. Thirty-three
officers taught both the seventh and ninth grade
curricula. At the end of training, officers were asked
to complete an anonymous training assessment
form which measured the extent to which they were
ready to teach the curriculum. The latter form con-
sisted of statements regarding the quality of their
training and level of preparedness to teach the new
curricula. Each statement was followed by a five-
point Likert scale. The statements were (i) I under-
stand the purpose of the curriculum, (ii) I feel ready
to use the teaching strategies, (iii) I believe that the
content of the lessons will help prevent substance
abuse among adolescents, (iv) I believe that most
students will become involved in the activities of
the lessons, (v) I believe the training was effective,
(vi) I am enthusiastic about this curriculum and (vii)
the trainers were knowledgeable.
Officer instructors who taught the curriculum
(n = 86) had an average age of 40 and were more
likely to be male (73.3%), white (73.3%) with some
college (33.7%) or higher education (39.6%). The
mean number of years as a police officer was 14.6
years and as a D.A.R.E. officer was 6.0 years. These
findings are consistent with the profile of D.A.R.E.
officers reported in a paper by Merrill et al. [24]. It
is interesting to note that 36% of the officers had
taught a prevention program other than a D.A.R.E.
curriculum and 27.8% had some graduate level
courses in education.
After completing the training to deliver the sev-
enth grade curriculum, 96% of the officer instruc-
tors agreed that they understood the purpose of the
curriculum, and the same percentage indicated that
they felt ready to use the teaching strategies pre-
sented during training. Ninety-two percent of them
believed that the content of the curriculum would
prevent/reduce substance use among middle and
high school students, and 96% indicated that they
believed most students would get involved in the
activities. Ninety-four percent agreed that the train-
ing was effective, and 96% agreed that they were
enthusiastic about teaching the new curriculum.
Similarly, 94% thought the trainers were prepared
and knowledgeable.
After the training for the ninth grade curriculum,
97% of officer instructors agreed that they under-
stood the purpose of the curriculum, and 93% felt
they were ready to use the new teaching strategies.
Ninety-three percent thought that the content cov-
ered would prevent/reduce substance use among
middle and high school students, and 97% believed
that students would get involved in the activities.
Further, 93% of the officer instructors agreed that
the training was effective, and 97% felt enthusiastic
about teaching the curriculum.
Only a few of the officer instructors had prior
teaching experiences in high school, and many
expressed concerns about management of high
school students during the ninth grade training.
However, in debriefing interviews with the officer
instructors between 6 and 9 months after their ex-
periences teaching high school students, >85%
reported that they enjoyed these older students
and would teach them again.
Measurement and data collection
Content coverage and instructional strategy
For purposes of this study and for consistency with
the curriculum design, the dimensions of imple-
mentation fidelity encompassed content coverage
and instructional strategy. To measure these com-
ponents, officer instructors were observed in the
Z. Sloboda et al.
398
classroom. Two key lessons (second and sixth in
sequence) were selected for observation from the
seventh grade curriculum because of their focus
and the different instructional strategies required.
The first lesson observed (Lesson 2) includes the
types of activities, didactic instructional strategies
and level of student engagement similar to the
D.A.R.E. officers' previous experiences. Con-
versely, the second lesson observed (Lesson 6) on
the other hand focuses on skills building and its
activities are more student centered and highly in-
teractive requiring a different set of instructional
strategies and facilitation techniques. These two
lessons also emphasize key elements of the curric-
ula's theoretical foundation with Lesson 2 focusing
on the effects of drugs on the body and Lesson 6 on
building decision-making skills.
For the ninth grade curriculum, a similar ap-
proach was taken. The ninth grade curriculum
was designed to actively engage students in group
problem solving and discussion and heavily focuses
on the current and future consequences of substance
use. Again, Lessons 2 and 6 were selected for ob-
servation. Lesson 2 addresses the effects of mari-
juana and ecstasy on the brain and in turn on
emotions and behaviors. In addition, normative
beliefs about peer use of these drugs are discussed.
Lesson 6 examines the social and legal consequen-
ces of substance use with a heavy emphasis on
alcohol use.
Instructors were observed teaching each of the
two selected lessons twice. The lessons chosen for
observation were to be sequential and neither the
first class of instruction nor the last class of instruc-
tion for that day was observed. Each instructor was
observed a total of four times in each observation
year. Standardized observation coding sheets were
created for each of the lessons being observed. Be-
cause of the size and scope of the study in terms of
school sites, focus on reliability of coding of obser-
vations was placed on instrumentation development
and training of the observers. Two pilot studies
were conducted in a total of 13 Ohio middle schools
with nine officer instructors and 13 high schools
with 11 officer instructors and included >1200 mid-
dle school students and >700 high school students.
The purpose of the pilot studies was to have trained
Ohio D.A.R.E. officer instructors deliver the curric-
ula, to test our consenting procedures and to pre-test
data collection instruments including the student
survey and the observation forms for the two se-
lected lessons. Two observers independently rated
officer instructors. On the first round of observa-
tions, the ease of using the forms was assessed.
On the second round, reliability of the instrument
was determined. Interrater agreement with two
raters ranged from 82 to 94% for observation forms
for the seventh and ninth grade curricula.
During training for the national study, University-
employed observers reviewed the lessons which
would be observed. Emphasis was placed on
noting what the officer instructors and students
were doing during the lesson. The trainees then
viewed a video of an officer instructor delivering
the lessons in a real classroom setting. Their codes
were shared and discussed. The training ended with
another viewing of the video and codes reviewed.
Trainees who were outliers were not used to make
the observations.
The observers recorded for each activity whether
the activity and its subactivities were covered, the
amount of time involved with that activity, the
officer's instructional strategy (from a check-off
list--non-interactive, lecture/listen, ask questions,
discuss, model or facilitate) and the students' be-
havior (also from a check-off list--non-interactive,
lecture, answer questions, discuss, model or prob-
lem solving). Observers were provided with a defi-
nition sheet for the instructional strategies with
examples of behaviors for each instructional strat-
egy/code. The observers also recorded the number
of students who were off-task during an activity. In
addition, they recorded `any interesting, unusual or
other information which is pertinent to the study'.
Lastly, the observers were asked to rate the instruc-
tors on the following six questions, using a five-
point Likert scale (agree, kind of agree, neutral,
kind of disagree and disagree): (i) was the instructor
enthusiastic? (ii) did the students appear to be com-
fortable talking with the officer? (iii) did the stu-
dents and the officer smile and laugh while staying
on task? (iv) did the instructor appear to listen

399
attentively? (v) did the officer seem well prepared to
teach? and (vi) did the students understand the offi-
cer's directions, explanations and questions. During
training, officers were told about the observations
and signed consents agreeing to be observed.
Analyses were conducted to determine the
within-observer consistency and between-observer
correlation between observations of the lessons for
content coverage and officer instructor instructional
strategy. Among these analyses were analyses of
variances (ANOVAs) with the observer serving as
a fixed-effect, paired t-tests for the two observations
and correlations between all observations. There
were no significant findings on the ANOVAs and
the t-tests, and the correlations were all in the mod-
erate range indicating that the observers showed no
systematic bias in scoring.
Content coverage was measured by summing the
number of activities and subactivities presented for
each lesson observed. Items were coded 0, did not
cover, and 1, covered. Content items were added
together and divided by the total number of activi-
ties to be covered, producing the proportion of ac-
tivities covered for each lesson. The seventh grade
curriculum included 16 content items in Lesson 2
and 21 content items in Lesson 6 while for the ninth
grade, the number of content items was 25 for Les-
son 2 and 26 for Lesson 6.
Adherence to appropriate instructional strategy
was coded for each activity for each of the lessons
observed. First, each activity was scored as to
whether it was covered or not. Then, each activity
was scored 0 if the officer was non-compliant and 1
if the officer was compliant, i.e. the officer's in-
structional strategy matched the strategy indicated
in the teaching manual.
Lesson mediators
The mediator measures came from the self-admin-
istered surveys completed by students participating
in each of the observed classes. For these analyses,
comparisons of measures of the targeted mediators
were made between the seventh pre- and post-test
surveys for the observed seventh grade lessons and
the ninth grade pre- and post-test surveys for the
observed ninth grade lessons. Students who were in
classrooms observed for fidelity were selected and
matched to the officer instructor who delivered the
curriculum in those students' classrooms. The re-
lationship of interest is estimated at the classroom
level (seventh grade Lesson2, n = 101 observed clas-
ses; seventh grade Lesson 6, n = 104 observed
classes; ninth grade Lesson 2, n = 120 observed clas-
ses and ninth grade Lesson 6, n = 120 observed
classes).
Lesson 2 of the seventh grade curriculum for
TCYL was intended to impact perceptions of the
consequences of the use of substances and for Les-
son 6, decision-making skills while Lesson 2 of the
ninth grade curriculum targeted resistance skills,
consequences of substance use and normative
beliefs regarding substance use among peers, and
Lesson 6 focused primarily on the social and legal
consequences of alcohol use. The questions used to
measure these mediators (described below) were
taken from national studies such as the Monitoring
the Future Study.
`Normative beliefs' were measured using two
scales. The first scale, normative beliefs I, was com-
puted using the mean of five ordinal items asking
students to estimate how many eighth graders (or in
the case of the ninth grade surveys, 10th graders)
used cocaine, alcohol, tobacco, inhalants or mari-
juana in the prior 30 days (alpha = 0.81). Scores
ranged from one (none) to five (most eighth graders
used this substance in the prior 30 days). The sec-
ond scale, normative beliefs II (alpha = 0.90), was
constructed using the mean of seven items complet-
ing the statement: `Most students my age think it's
okay to.'. Examples of responses to this statement
include `smoke one or more cigarettes a day' and
`smoke marijuana once in a while'. Scores range
from one (agreement) to five (disagreement). These
scales were reverse coded so that higher scores in-
dicate better program outcomes.
The `perceived consequences of substance use'
measure focused on the negative effects of tobacco,
alcohol and other drugs on the functioning of the
brain and perceptions of social consequences as
a result of the use of alcohol. For the former mea-
sure, we used the mean of five ordinal items asking
students how much they think using a specific drug
Z. Sloboda et al.
400
has an effect on the functioning of the brain (alpha =
0.86 in seventh grade and 0.88 in ninth grade).
Scores range from one (none) to five (a lot). For
the other consequences measure, we asked students
to respond to six statements measuring negative
alcohol expectancies such as `If I drank alcohol, I
might do things that I wouldn't normally do' and `If
I drank alcohol, I would get into trouble with
parents/caregivers'. Response categories were `dis-
agree, kind of disagree, neither, kind of agree and
agree'. These items were combined by taking the
mean across the six items.
`Knowledge of resistance skills' was measured
by responses given to three hypothetical scenarios
involving the opportunity to use tobacco, alcohol or
marijuana. Students were asked to read a scenario in
which a given substance was offered by a peer and
to select the most appropriate refusal response to
the offer `given the person being offered does not
want to use'. Each response was weighted accord-
ing to the level of assertiveness it demonstrated. For
example, a response of `no, maybe later' was
assigned a lower score than a response of `no
thanks, I don't want to smoke'. Scores ranged from
zero (least appropriate response) to two (best re-
sponse chosen) for each scenario and then summed
for a final score ranging from zero to six.
`Decision-making skills' were measured in the
seventh grade by a single item with a choice of five
responses weighted to reflect the level of decision-
making skill for that response. Scores include
0 (worse response), 1 (second best response) and
2 (best response).
Results
Coverage
The range of scores (representing the proportion)
for content coverage for Lesson 2 of the seventh
grade curriculum was 0.34­1.00 and Lesson 6,
0.36­1.00. The median coverage for instruction of
the seventh grade curriculum was 0.81 for Lesson 2
and 0.72 for Lesson 6.
Coverage for the ninth grade curriculum for Les-
son 2 ranged from 0.12 to 1.00 and from 0.13 to
1.00 for Lesson 6. The median coverage of activi-
ties for the ninth grade curriculum was 0.70 for
Lesson 2 and 0.78 for Lesson 6.
Instructional strategy
The median score for the proportion of activities
delivered using the appropriate instructional strat-
egy was 0.63 for Lesson 2 and 0.44 for Lesson 6.
That is, half of the officers used the correct instruc-
tional strategy for about two-thirds of the activ-
ities in Lesson 2. In addition, half of the officers
used the correct instructional strategy for at least
0.44 of the activities in Lesson 6. However, as seen
for content coverage, the range of scores was large
(0.31­0.94 for Lesson 2 and from 0.10 to 0.83 for
Lesson 6).
The median score for use of the appropriate in-
structional strategy was 0.50 for Lesson 2 and 0.60
for Lesson 6. That is, half of the officers utilized the
appropriate instructional strategy for at least half of
the activities in Lesson 2 and in at least 0.60 of the
activities in Lesson 6. Again, the range of scores
for the lessons was similar to those for content
coverage, 0.12­0.96 for Lesson 2 and 0.12­1.00
for Lesson 6.
Higher content coverage was positively corre-
lated with the use of appropriate instructional strat-
egy (r = 0.93, P < 0.001). There were no significant
correlations between officer instructor's age, sex,
race or level of education and the mean level of
curriculum content coverage or use of the appropri-
ate instructional strategy at either the seventh or
ninth grade.
Relationship of content coverage and
adherence to appropriate instructional
strategy and the targeted lesson mediators
The analyses examining the relationship between
content coverage and use of the appropriate instruc-
tional strategy and the scores on the targeted lesson
mediators were conducted using hierarchical linear
modeling (HLM) to estimate two-level random in-
tercept models (individuals nested within observed
classrooms). These models are necessary to take
into account the nested nature of the data. HLM

models produce unbiased estimates of standard
errors and corresponding significance tests [25].
This is accomplished by the inclusion of a second-
level error term (l0
) that allows the individual
level errors (rij
) to be uncorrelated. Higher scores
on content coverage and adherence to instructional
strategy variables represent higher coverage and
adherence during the specific lesson being ob-
served. Thus, we would predict positive relation-
ships between the coverage and adherence
variables and the mediators. In addition, we control
for the pre-test scores on each of the program medi-
ators when estimating the effect of implementation
fidelity on the mediators measured at the post-test.
The effect of the pre-test on the post-test score is
estimated at the individual level and the effect of
implementation fidelity (content coverage and ad-
herence to the appropriate instructional style) is es-
timated at the classroom level. For that reason,
student data used in the analyses came from the
surveys for students who were in the classroom at
the time of observation. The number of observed
classrooms was 101 and 104 for Lessons 2 and 6,
respectively, of the seventh grade curriculum and
120 for both Lessons 2 and 6 of the ninth grade
curriculum. Table I provides summary statistics
for these items measured prior to and after the
intervention.
The HLM analyses showed that for Lesson 2 of
the seventh grade curriculum, there was no relation-
ship between content coverage and perceptions of
consequences (see Table II). For Lesson 6, how-
ever, we found a statistically significantly better
outcome on decision-making skills for students ex-
posed to higher content coverage. The findings for
adherence to appropriate instructional strategy par-
alleled those for content coverage in the seventh
grade, with use of appropriate instructional strategy
related significantly to improved decision-making
skills. Specifically, the odds of giving the second
best answer (1) as opposed to giving the best an-
swer (2) are multiplied by 0.51 (eÀ0.666) for every
one unit increase in appropriate instructional strat-
egy. Alternatively, a 10% increase in appropriate
instructional strategy would decrease the odds of
being in the worst answer category (as opposed to
being in the best answer category) by 0.04 (0.10 3
eÀ0.986).
The analyses for Lesson 2 of the ninth grade
curriculum showed that while coverage did not
make a difference on resistance skills or the norma-
tive belief measures, students exposed to higher
content coverage scored significantly higher on
the consequences measure. That is, students ex-
posed to a higher proportion of the content had
significantly greater perceptions of negative conse-
quences of substance use compared with students
exposed to less content. Similar results were found
when the measure of appropriate instructional strat-
egy was examined.
Finally, we examined whether content coverage
and the use of the appropriate instructional strategy
impacted negative alcohol expectancies, as targeted
in Lesson 6 of the ninth grade curriculum. Results
from hierarchical regression models suggest that

both content coverage and instructional strategy
were significantly related to negative alcohol ex-
pectancies, in the expected direction. That is, expo-
sure to more content and appropriate instructional
strategy leads students to perceive more negative
expectancies for alcohol use.
Summary and discussion
The purpose of this paper is to explore the issue of
implementation fidelity within the context of a large
study designed to evaluate a substance abuse pre-
vention program, TCYL, delivered by officer
instructors (D.A.R.E.). The focus was on two meas-
ures of implementation fidelity--content coverage
and adherence to the appropriate instructional strat-
egy. TCYL's programmatic conceptual design was
based on principles of substance abuse prevention
which include addressing misconceptions held by
students regarding the normative nature of the use
of substances and helping students understand the
negative consequences of substance use. In addi-
tion, the program provides opportunities to discuss
this decision and to practice skills to resist use in
a variety of age-appropriate and relevant situations.
Therefore, the emphasis of TCYL, as with other
recently designed substance abuse prevention pro-
grams, is on specific content and the use of instruc-
tional strategies which help students internalize the
skills and knowledge that is provided. D.A.R.E.
officers have traditionally used didactic teaching

aFor the decision-making skills outcome, we utilized a multinomial logistic hierarchical regression model. This model compares giving
a worst answer (0) or a second best answer (1) to a best answer (2). Negative coefficients in these models indicate that students with
exposure to higher fidelity are less likely to be in the 0 or 1 (worst answer or second best answer) categories than in the 2 (best answer)
category. For all other outcomes, we utilized a hierarchical linear model. Z scores in bold are significant at the P = 0.05 level, using
a two-tailed test.
bBriefly, normative beliefs I refers to the objective beliefs students hold about the proportion of students their age using drugs.
Normative beliefs II refers to the idea that most adolescents think it is ok to use drugs. See the measurement section for a full description
of these two measures.

techniques and the use of interactive strategies
which more fully engage students in the learning
process is a challenge. The substudy allowed us to
determine to what extent the officer instructors de-
livered TCYL as it was intended both in content and
instructional strategy and to relate fidelity with tar-
geted program mediators.
We found that the scores for these components of
implementation had large ranges, skewed toward
the higher implementation levels. Overall, the me-
dian scores indicate that the officer instructors were
stronger in covering the content of the curricula
than in their use of appropriate instructional strate-
gies. This may be due to the officer instructors'
prior experience in didactic teaching methods as
used with other D.A.R.E. curricula. For the ob-
served Lessons 2 which required more didactic
and modeling instructional strategies, the scores
were better than those for observed Lessons 6
which required more interactive and guiding in-
structional strategies.
The relationship between implementation fidelity
and the targeted mediators, although not always con-
sistent, showed promising results. Although higher
scores for content coverage and use of appropriate
instructional strategies for Lesson 2 of the seventh
grade curriculum did not show any impact, Lesson 2
of the ninth grade curriculum and Lessons 6 for both
the seventh and ninth grade curricula did show sta-
tistically significant differences on decision-making
skills, perceived negative consequences of sub-
stance use and alcohol expectancies. These findings
suggest that the greater the adherence both to the
curricula as designed and engagement of students
as prescribed appear to produce the desired impact
on those elements or targeted mediators of the
intervention.
The similarities in findings across the two dimen-
sions of implementation fidelity are not surprising
given the high correlations between more complete
content coverage and use of appropriate instruc-
tional style. However, the inconsistency of the re-
lationship between how the program was delivered
and the mediator scores are difficult to assess. Les-
son 2 focuses heavily on consequences of substance
use showing how these substances impact brain
functioning. Students participate in teams as emer-
gency medical technicians and must determine
what substance a hypothetical student has taken
by reviewing that student's symptoms. It may be
that involvement in the activities of the lesson may
be sufficient alone and that it does not matter how
the officer instructor presents the material. In con-
trast, Lesson 6 of the seventh grade curriculum
emphasizes two aspects of decision making. First
is learning the steps involved in making decisions
while the second is to apply these steps through
group discussion using a scenario as an organizing
framework. In this way, decision making is rein-
forced using different instructional strategies.
The major thrust of Lesson 2 of the ninth grade
curriculum is on the consequences of substance use
within the context of impeded brain functioning.
Resistance skills in this lesson address both external
and internal pressures to use alcohol and drugs. The
activities for the session were primarily done in
teams with `go around' brainstorming around strat-
egies to resist these pressures. The idea is to have
the students talk about the pressures and within the
context of several scenarios suggest how to avoid
use of alcohol or drugs. Perhaps the options within
the question responses are not sufficiently sensitive
to reflect changes.
There are several limitations to the substudy
which should be mentioned. First, as noted previ-
ously, the decision-making skills' outcome is mea-
sured by a single item indicator. This item does not
have the psychometric properties of a multiple item
scale and thus measurement reliability cannot be
assessed. In spite of this limitation, we did find
significant associations between implementation
fidelity and this outcome. It is unlikely that imple-
mentation fidelity is correlated with measurement
error. It is more likely that this relationship is mis-
estimated due to our inability to estimate a measure-
ment model. Structural equation models, with
a multiple item indicator of decision-making skills,
would likely show stronger relationships than those
estimated here. However, despite of this limitation,
the observed association is statistically significant.
Also related to this issue is the measure of resis-
tance skills for the ninth grade curriculum. We drew

from other research in developing these measures.
However, as we mentioned earlier, our approach
needs to be revisited.
A second limitation of the current project is the
limited number of lessons observed each year. Be-
cause of time and cost, we decided to sample the
lessons choosing those lessons which focused on
some of the mediators and which represented dif-
ferent instructional strategies. Therefore, we only
observed 20% of the lessons (two of 10 lessons)
in seventh grade and 28% of the lessons (two of
seven lessons) in ninth grade. It would have been
interesting to observe a greater number of lessons to
see if the results found for these four observed les-
sons held. We do believe that these lessons do re-
flect the broader curriculum and, indeed, high
correlations were found between lessons for indi-
vidual officer instructors with r values of 0.535
being the lowest between the two observations of
use of appropriate instructional strategy for the
ninth grade curriculum to 0.926 for use of appro-
priate instructional strategy for the ninth grade cur-
riculum. These high values suggest that the number
of observed lessons may be sufficient. Future stud-
ies may want to assess more program lessons, al-
though we acknowledge that this is a costly
endeavor.
This project is unique in that we had a large sam-
ple of observed classrooms. Current statistical tech-
niques, such as the hierarchical linear models,
utilized in the current project require relatively large
sample sizes. Unfortunately, even with such a large
sample of observed classrooms, we may not have
had sufficient power to detect effects at the 0.05
level. A larger sample of classrooms would have
increased power. This is of real concern for future
research and smaller projects, where implementa-
tion quality will be assessed across fewer class-
rooms. Techniques, such as the multilevel models,
estimated here are not recommended for sample
sizes <15.
One explanation of why the D.A.R.E. officers
would adhere to the curriculum so closely may be
due to the organization's regimented training and
heavy reliance on the printed teaching manuals
(e.g. officers were taught outlining skills during
training with D.A.R.E. America as part of prepa-
ration for teaching). However, of concern are the
moderate scores for using the appropriate instruc-
tional strategies, particularly those which are
highly interactive. It is possible that more positive
experience with such strategies will give the offi-
cers more confidence. Clearly, the officers need to
have feedback to reinforce their good techniques
and to correct those which are problematic. It is
therefore important to have teachers within the
schools or D.A.R.E. mentors available to provide
this assistance.
However, the information needed to guide train-
ing of deliverers of substance abuse prevention pro-
gramming requires the field to develop standard
definitions and measures of the components which
constitute fidelity of implementation and the meth-
odologies best suited to collect these data. The
approaches used in this study to examine imple-
mentation were drawn heavily from those reported
in the literature. Many former studies rely on self-
report of the instructors using a checklist. There are
obvious limitations of such an approach. Further-
more, few studies include more than one dimension
of implementation, primarily examining some as-
pect of content coverage or exposure. The curricu-
lum design of TCYL included as key features not
only content but also instructional strategy using
the most appropriate strategy to enhance the learn-
ing process.
Although implementation fidelity has been
addressed by individual investigators, there are no
standardized definitions, measurements or data col-
lection methodologies to guide this research. As
programs go from controlled `laboratory' settings
into the `real world', it will be more important to
develop these standards to determine to what extent
programs are implemented in the field as they were
designed to be delivered under research controlled
conditions.
