Childcare Patterns
and Issues for Families
of Preschool Children
With Disabilities
Cathryn Booth-LaForce, PhD; Jean F. Kelly, PhD
A longitudinal investigation of childcare for children with developmental disabilities (N = 89) was
conducted, with in-person assessments at 12, 15, 30, and 45 months of age, and phone interviews
with mothers at 14, 29, 37, and 44 months. When compared with typically developing children
from another sample, and with census data, the participants entered childcare at an older age and
for fewer hours; they were more likely to be in "informal" (father, relative, in-home nonrelative)
care; and they were less likely to transition into more formal care (childcare center, childcare
home) with increasing age. Finding good-quality care, the cost of care, distance/transportation
issues, and integration with other services/special needs received the highest ratings for childcare
issues. Children who were not in childcare had lower adaptive behavior scores if their mothers
cited their child's special needs as an issue in keeping them out of care, compared with children
whose mothers did not indicate that special needs were an issue. These 2 groups did not differ
in their diagnoses, mental, or motor development scores. Results are discussed in the context
of family leave policies and welfare work exemptions, and the need for high-quality caregiving
options. Key words: childcare, developmental delay, developmental disability, special needs
RELIANCE on nonmaternal childcare has
become a normative aspect of childrea-
ring in the United States. In the most recent
childcare data report from the US Census Bu-
reau, Smith (2002) found that 63% of children
under 5 years of age were spending time in
some form of regular childcare arrangement
for an average of about 37 hours per week.

dramatic increases in maternal employment in
the past few decades have led to a concomi-
tant increase in the need for childcare arrange-
ments for infants and young children.
Although there are no national statistics on
childcare usage among families with children
with disabilities, Landis (1992) found that the
mothers of these children entered the labor
force at the same rate as the general popula-
tion. In an earlier report on the present sam-
ple of children with disabilities, as well as chil-
dren with biomedical risk factors, we found
that more than 58% were in some form of
nonmaternal childcare by 15 months of age
(Booth & Kelly, 1998). Thus, it would appear
that the need for childcare is no less evident
among families of children with special needs
than it is for families of typically developing
children. In fact, childcare issues have been
among the most important problems reported
by parents of children with disabilities in
survey research (Axtell, Garwick, Patterson,
Bennett, & Blum, 1995; Bailey, Blasco, &

Warfield, 1995; Herman & Thompson, 1995;
Horner, Rawlins, & Giles, 1987; Palfrey,
Walker, Butler, & Singer, 1989).
Like many other families with young chil-
dren, families of children with disabilities are
faced with a variety of childcare issues, such
as finding good-quality, affordable care that is
within a reasonable distance from home or
work. Additionally, they are faced with logisti-
cal problems such as transportation between
early intervention (or special education) and
childcare programs, and with limited avail-
ability of childcare options due to their chil-
dren's special care needs. Despite federal
mandates that all early childhood programs
must be accessible to all children (Americans
with Disabilities Act, P.L. 101­336), many pro-
grams are not equipped to meet the needs
of these children (Bredekamp, 1993), and
many caregivers lack the appropriate train-
ing (Crowley, 1990; Dinnebeil, McInerney,
Fox, & Juchartz-Pendry, 1998; Fewell, 1993;
Warfield & Hauser-Cram, 1996). Additionally,
the severity of the child's disability or ill-
ness compounds these problems (Breslau,
Salkever, & Staruch, 1982; Stoiber, Gettinger,
& Goetz, 1998; Warfield & Hauser-Cram,
1996). Although model training and consul-
tation programs have yielded encouraging re-
sults (eg, Giovinazzo & Cook, 1995; Jones &
Meisels, 1987; Klein & Sheehan, 1987; Richey,
Richey, & Webb, 1996; Ross, 1992), the ma-
jority of caregivers have not received such
training.
EARLY CHILD CARE STUDY OF
CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS
In order to find out more about patterns of
childcare usage and the childcare needs and
challenges of families of children with disabil-
ities, we examined data from the Early Child
Care Study of Children with Special Needs, a
longitudinal study conducted by the present
authors. The main purpose of this ecological
study was to examine the complex interac-
tions among child and family characteristics,
and the effects of varying quantity and quality
of home and childcare environments on the
development of children with disabilities and
biomedical risk factors from 12 to 45 months
of age (see Booth & Kelly, 2002). In the con-
text of this study, we collected a wealth of lon-
gitudinal data about the age at which these
children entered nonmaternal childcare, the
weekly hours spent in care, and the type of
care, as well as interview data about mothers'
reasons for not using childcare, the problems
and issues of mothers who chose to use child-
care, and the particular problem of integrating
childcare with other services. In this report,
we focus on the children who had diagnosed
disabilities by the age of 12 months.
COMPARISON DATA
In describing patterns of childcare usage,
we have included data for comparison pur-
poses from the typically developing children
enrolled in the NICHD Study of Early Child
Care, a 10-site national longitudinal investiga-
tion of over 1300 children and their families
(see NICHD Early Child Care Research Net-
work [ECCRN], 2001). This is a particularly
appropriate comparison sample because we
patterned the research design and data collec-
tion methods for the Special Needs study after
the NICHD study, for which we are investiga-
tors also. We have included some additional
comparisons with the most recent US cen-
sus data about childcare, based on the Spring
1997 Survey of Income and Program Partici-
pation, which provide a "snapshot" of fami-
lies' patterns of childcare usage in the previ-
ous month prior to the survey (Smith, 2002).
SPECIAL NEEDS STUDY SAMPLE
AND PROCEDURES
Children with disabilities (n = 89) and their
mothers enrolled in the Special Needs study
when the children were approximately 12
months old, and we collected data through
45 months of age. In-person visits and as-
sessments occurred at 12, 15, 30, and 45
months, and a staff member contacted fam-
ilies by phone at 14, 29, 37, and 44

months to update demographic and childcare
information.
At the beginning of the study, the mothers
had an average of 13.8 (SD = 2.2) years of ed-
ucation, and 84% were married or had a part-
ner. Family income was below the poverty
line for 37.5% of the sample, and 18.2% of
the sample was in the near-poor category.
More boys (64%) than girls were enrolled,
reflecting the tendency for boys to be over-
represented in samples of children with spe-
cial needs. Most of the children (81%) were
European American non-Hispanic (7% were
Hispanic, 7% African American, 2% Asian, and
3% Other).
The children's specific diagnoses at 12, 30,
and 45 months are shown in Table 1. At 12
months of age, children qualified for the study
if they were enrolled in an early interven-
tion program because of their identified spe-
cial needs. We did not include children who
had severe visual or hearing impairments, be-
cause of assessment difficulties. We included
children in the present report at 30 and 45
months only if they had demonstrated a 25%
or greater developmental delay.
PATTERNS OF CHILDCARE USE
Participation in childcare
Our first question concerned the extent to
which families used nonmaternal childcare
over time in this sample. We found that more

45 months, children were included in the delayed group if they had a 25% or greater developmental delay.
than half of the families had children in some
form of childcare arrangement by 14 months,
and use of childcare increased over time, as
shown in Fig 1. Specifically, at 14 months, 56%
of the children were in some form of nonma-
ternal childcare, and this figure increased to
74% by 45 months. The average across ages
was 65%, which is comparable to the 63%
reported in the census data. Although the
percentage of children with disabilities in
childcare increased over time, as shown in
Fig 1, these numbers were considerably lower
than the percentage of typically developing
children in childcare in the NICHD study. On
average, 80% of the latter children were in
childcare, increasing from 72% at 15 months
to 90% at 46 months.
Age of entry and hours
As shown in Table 2, the average age of en-
tering any form of nonmaternal childcare was
11.5 (SD = 12.6) months. In contrast, the typ-
ically developing children in the NICHD sam-
ple tended to enter care much earlier, at an
average age of 5.3 (SD = 6.7) months. The
children with disabilities spent an average of
21.4 (SD = 13.9) hours in childcare per week
during the months that they were in a child-
care arrangement. The number of hours per
week of childcare in the NICHD sample from
3 to 54 months of age was higher, with a
mean of 27.0 (SD = 15.4) hours per week. In
fact, the latter figure may be an underestimate,

because it includes hours for months that
the child was not in childcare (ie, 0 hours),
whereas the mean for the Special Needs study
does not. The recent census data reported an
even higher figure for hours in care--37 hours

Type of care
Table 3 shows the proportion of children
in each type of nonmaternal care at 14, 29,
37, and 44 months. At each age, the most
common type was care by a nonparental rel-
ative, averaging 32% of the sample (ranging
from 28% to 35% across ages). The second
most common type at each age was care
by the child's father (or mother's partner),
with an average of 24% of the sample (rang-
ing from 21% to 27% across ages). Children

in center care comprised 18% of the sam-
ple (range = 16%­20%); home-based nonrela-
tive care, 15% (range = 10%­20%); and child-
care homes (ie, family daycare homes), 11%
(range = 5%­14%).
In contrast, in the NICHD study the most
common type was center care (33%; range =
17%­48%), followed by childcare homes
(24%; range = 15%­30%). Father care com-
prised 18% (range = 15%­21%), followed by
relative care at 16% (range = 12%­20%) and
home-based nonrelative care at 9% (range =
5%­12%).
In addition to the differences between sam-
ples in the average types of care used, there
were notable differences in the patterns of
care types over time. These differences are
illustrated in Figs 2 to 4. Figure 2 shows

the proportion of each sample in "informal"
(father/partner, relative, in-home nonrelative)
care across time. It is clear that informal care
decreased with age in the NICHD sample, but
it remained high and relatively stable in the
delayed sample.

Childcare Patterns 11
Finally, Fig 4 shows the proportion of chil-
dren in center care over time. Although the
proportion of children in center care was very
similar in the 2 samples at 14 months, there
was a dramatic increase in center-care use
in the typically developing sample over time,
while the proportion of children in center
care in the delayed sample remained relatively
stable with increasing age.
We also compared types of care in the
Special Needs sample with the most recent
census data. Because the census data were
collected at only one point in time for a cross
section of preschoolers of all ages, we com-
pared these figures with the average across
time for the Special Needs sample. We found
that children with disabilities were less likely
to be in center care (18% vs 24%), more likely
to be in informal care (71% vs 64%), and about
equally likely to be in childcare homes (11% vs
12%).
CHILDCARE ISSUES
For those mothers whose children were in
childcare, we asked them to rate (from 1 = no
problem to 5 = a very big problem) the ex-
tent to which 7 childcare issues were prob-
lematic for them. These issues were: (a) find-
ing good-quality care, (b) confidence in staff,
(c) integration with services, (d) cost, (e) spe-
cial equipment or needs, (f) distance, and (g)

transportation. These data appear in Table 4.
Although there were a range of ratings for
each item, it is interesting that the average
score for each item was less than 3. In other
words, mothers did not find these issues to
be particularly problematic. Nonetheless, the
rank order of the ratings is interesting.
The item that received the highest (ie, most
problematic) rating at each age was find-
ing good-quality care. At 15 months of age,
the cost of childcare, distance to childcare,
and transportation issues were the next most
frequent problems. However, at 30 and 45
months, integration with services received
an increasingly high problem rating. This may
reflect changes in services provided for these
children, as they transition into more formal
special education programs.
As of 37 months of age, 61% of the children
had entered a special education program, and
this number increased to 95% by 44 months.
Of the children enrolled in special education,
the majority (69% at 37 months and 54% at
44 months) were also participating in some
form of nonmaternal childcare. Thus, families
were faced with the challenge of coordinat-
ing childcare with special education. Still, it
should be noted that the ratings for integrat-
ing services were still relatively low, and this is
reflected in mothers'specific responses about
whether they had a problem coordinating spe-
cial education with childcare. At 37 months,

only 6% of the mothers reported coordination
problems, and at 44 months, 23%. Interest-
ingly, at 37 months, only 9% of the mothers
whose children were enrolled in special edu-
cation plus childcare indicated that their Indi-
vidualized Family Service Plan specifically ad-
dressed the coordination between programs;
at 44 months, this figure was only 5%.
CHARACTERISTICS OF CHILDREN
NOT IN CHILDCARE
A final question concerned the extent to
which the children's special needs were a fac-
tor in families' decision to not use childcare.
These data are shown in Table 5. At 15 months
of age, 36% of the mothers who had made the
decision not to use childcare cited their chil-
dren'sspecial needs as a reason. At 30 months,
42% gave this reason, and at 45 months, 46%.
Table 6 shows a series of comparisons
of children whose mothers said that special
needs were an issue in deciding against child-
care, and children whose mothers did not give
this reason. We expected that children in the
former group would have more severe impair-
ments or perhaps would have different diag-
noses than would children in the latter group.
Chi-square analyses at each age indicated
that the groups did not differ in their di-
agnoses. A series of t tests comparing the
groups on mental, motor, and adaptive be-
havior scores at each age produced signifi-
cant group differences only for adaptive be-
havior at 30 months, t (47) = 2.19; p = .04,
and 45 months, t (35) = 2.60; p = .01. Specifi-
cally, mothers who cited their children's spe-
cial needs as a reason for not using childcare
had children with lower adaptive behavior
scores than did mothers who did not give this
reason.
Although we expect adaptive behavior to
be related to mental and motor development
scores, and to some extent, diagnoses, it is
interesting that adaptive behavior was the sig-
nificant one discriminating the group of chil-
dren whose mothers kept them out of child-
care because of special needs. That is, it was
the children's day-to-day functioning that ap-
peared to be of primary concern when con-
sidering childcare.
DISCUSSION
Patterns of care
From our longitudinal analyses of data from
the Early Child Care Study of Children with
Special Needs, we found that families of chil-
dren with disabilities have needs for child-
care that are comparable to the needs of fam-
ilies with typically developing children. Even
though the percentage of children with dis-
abilities participating in childcare during the
preschool years was lower than the percent-
age of children in the NICHD study (means of
65% vs 80%), the former figure was very simi-
lar to the percentage reported in the census
data (63%). Regardless of these differences,
it is clear that participation in nonmaternal
childcare during the preschool years is as

normative for children with disabilities as it is
for typically developing children.
Although the average percentage of chil-
dren experiencing childcare across the
preschool years was relatively high in this
study, the longitudinal nature of our data
revealed that the children with special
needs had different patterns of childcare
participation over time than did the typically
developing children. On average, the children
with disabilities entered childcare about 6
months later and, by conservative estimate,
for at least 6 fewer hours per week. Notably,
the 21.4 average weekly hours in the present
report is very similar to the 22.2 hours
reported in the Warfield and Hauser-Cram
(1996) study of preschool children with
disabilities.
The children with disabilities also were
more likely to be in informal care through-
out the first few years of life, rather than tran-
sitioning to more formal care as did many
of the typically developing children. These
findings echo other reports in the literature.
Specifically, Landis (1992) found that spouses
provided the largest proportion of type of
care among young children (birth to 3 years)
with special needs; in an older (5-year-old)
group of children with disabilities, Warfield
and Hauser-Cram (1996) found that care pro-
vided by relatives was most common and
center-based care the least common.
Childcare choices
Families of children with special needs may
choose informal care for a number of reasons.
One is that much of this care is provided by
fathers or other relatives and parents may be-
lieve that family members know best about
how to meet the child'sspecific special needs,
and/or appropriate alternative care may not
be available. The fact that finding good qual-
ity care was the most prominent concern of
mothers of children in childcare supports the
latter idea. This issue is a recurring theme that
has been found in prior research (Cuskelly,
LWW/IYC AS237-01 November 25, 2003 16:34 Char Count= 0
14 INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN/JANUARY­MARCH 2004
Pulman, & Hayes, 1998; Warfield & Hauser-
Cram, 1996).
Regardless of federal mandates about in-
clusion of children with disabilities in child-
care programs, many are not equipped to
meet the needs of these children (Bredekamp,
1993) and many caregivers lack the appro-
priate training (Crowley, 1990; Dinnebeil
et al., 1998; Fewell, 1993; Warfield & Hauser-
Cram, 1996). The inadequate supply of ap-
propriate childcare arrangements may be
especially problematic as the children with
disabilities approach school age. The NICHD
data showed a trend toward participation in
more formal childcare arrangements as the
children aged. These arrangements may pro-
vide more structured educational experiences
as well as opportunities to develop social
skills with peers, which would be expected
to provide important benefits in the transi-
tion to school. The continued reliance over
time on informal care in the Special Needs
sample might be less beneficial in the sense
that these children would be missing out on
important experiences, including daily inter-
actions with their typically developing peers,
and their transition to school might be more
problematic.
It is also interesting that families who chose
not to use childcare because of their child's
disability had children with lower adaptive be-
havior scores than did children whose moth-
ers did not indicate that their child's special
needs were a reason to keep their child out
of childcare. Once again, these data point
to the need for providing appropriate child-
care alternatives for families of children with
more severe disabilities. This is especially
problematic in light of evidence from the
present project about the effects of childcare
on children'sdevelopment (see Booth & Kelly,
2002). We found that after taking the child's
initial level of adaptive behavior into account,
increases in adaptive behavior were related to
children's participation in high-quality child-
care. Thus, these data suggest that given ap-
propriate high-quality childcare alternatives,
children functioning at a lower level of adap-
tive behavior may benefit from participation
in such care, and lack of such alternatives may
place these children even further behind their
peers when they enter school.
Childcare costs
Another reason that parents may choose
care by family members is that it is "free" or
far less costly than other types of care, and
this may be an economic necessity for fami-
lies. In fact, we found that the cost of child-
care was another one of the primary concerns
of mothers of children in childcare. At the
same gross income level, families of children
with special needs have additional expenses
such as medication, special services and activ-
ities, transportation, etc, resulting in a lower
net income than do families of children with-
out special needs (Gunn & Berry, 1987). Thus,
mothers' income may be even more neces-
sary in families in which the child has a dis-
ability than it is in other families. Adding the
cost of childcare to these additional expenses
may be highly problematic for families, par-
ticularly for those who are low-income, and
children with special needs are overrepre-
sented in poverty samples (Bennett & Gural-
nick, l991). For example, in Washington State,
75% of children under the age of 3 who are
enrolled in Infant/Toddler Early Intervention
Programs (children with established disabili-
ties or at environmental or biological risk of
disability) are Medicaid recipients (Washing-
ton State Department of Social and Health Ser-
vices [DSHS], l997).
In some families, the decision for the
mother to stay at home and care for a child
with a disability is one that can be made with-
out adverse financial consequences. How-
ever, in other families, maternal employment
may be absolutely necessary for the economic
well-being of the family. In fact, in a small
Australian study, Cuskelly et al., (1998) found
that 100% of mothers of children with special
needs, but only 60% of mothers of children
without disabilities indicated that they were
employed because their "wage is needed." In

such cases, families may have few options
about the type and quality of care arrange-
ment to select.
These data suggest the importance of
strengthening family leave policies to include
more families who might benefit from job-
protected leave under the provisions of the
Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). In l995,
only 54.9% of workers met the FMLA em-
ployee eligibility requirements, which include
continuous, full-time work for a covered em-
ployer (Department of Labor, l995). In addi-
tion, the FMLA provides only unpaid leave,
which is not sufficient for mothers depen-
dent on their own contributions to the family
income.
In low-income families, particularly those
with single mothers, the need for the mother
to stay at home and care for her young child
with special needs may result in the need
for government assistance. Ironically, the cur-
rent welfare-to-work Temporary Assistance to
Needy Family (TANF) regulations may pro-
vide only a few months' respite from work
requirements, unless families can qualify for
a hardship exemption. However, not all fam-
ilies of children with disabilities living in
poverty will be able to obtain a hardship ex-
emption, and the lack of provision for child-
care assistance for mothers who are forced
to enter the workforce despite their chil-
dren's special needs, compounds the prob-
lem of inadequate care alternatives (Ohlson,
1998).
Integrating services and programs
Another issue for families was the problem
of integrating other services with childcare,
especially as the children transitioned into for-
mal special education programs. These data
point to the need not only to address the is-
sue of appropriate childcare alternatives, but
also to assist families in coordinating their
childcare choices with educational programs
that are not scheduled around parents' work
hours. Very few of the mothers in this study in-
dicated that their IFSP addressed the need for
coordination of childcare and other services,
suggesting the need for improvement in this
area.
CONCLUSIONS
Taken together, our study results suggest
that families of children with disabilities
would benefit from increased options about
whether and when to initiate childcare, and
the type of care to use. From a policy per-
spective, this may mean increased funding
for hands-on caregiver training and education
(Stoiber et al., 1998), on the one hand, and
increased funding for family leave and wel-
fare work exemptions, on the other. Every
child with a disability should have access to
the most optimal care for their specific needs,
whether that means care by the mother, by
another family member, or by another well-
trained care-provider.
