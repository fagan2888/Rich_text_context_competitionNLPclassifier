Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the 1-year clinical outcomes of patients who received the Resolute
OnyxTM stent.
Methods: This was a single-centre, retrospective registry analysis that reviewed the clinical data
from all patients who were implanted with a Resolute OnyxTM stent between March 2015 and
February 2016. Clinical follow-up was performed at 1 year post-implantation.
Results: A total of 252 patients received a Resolute OnyxTM stent and two patients were lost to
follow-up. The mean age of the cohort was 66.9 years and 113 (45.2%) had diabetes mellitus.
Thirty-eight patients (15.2%) had left main disease and 73 (29.2%) had three-vessel disease. A total
of 175 patients (70.0%) had small vessel disease (<2.75 mm) and 210 (84.0%) had long lesions
(>20 mm). The 1-year target lesion failure was 4.4% (11 of 250), cardiovascular death occurred in
eight patients (3.2%), ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularization was undertaken in five
patients (2.0%) and stent thrombosis occurred in one patient (0.4%).
Conclusion: The Resolute OnyxTM stent showed a favourable 1-year clinical performance in a
real-world population.

eluting technology has improved the efficacy
and safety of second-generation DES.1,2 The
ResoluteTM Integrity zotarolimus-eluting
stent (R-ZES; Medtronic Inc., Santa Rosa,
CA, USA) has been extensively studied in
the Resolute Global Clinical Program,3
which demonstrated favourable clinical out-
comes in an all-comer population. The latest
version of R-ZES, Resolute OnyxTM, was
launched in November 2014. This study
investigated the 1-year clinical outcomes of
patients who had received this new
technology.
Patients and methods
Study design and population
This was a single-centre retrospective
registry analysis. From the launch of
Resolute OnyxTM, all patients treated in
the Division of Cardiology, Queen Mary
Hospital, University of Hong Kong, Hong
Kong who had been fitted with a Resolute
OnyxTM stent between March 2015 and
February 2016 were identified in the hospital
database and recruited to the analysis. There
were no exclusion criteria except patients
lost to follow-up or those who could not
be contacted for assessment at 1 year after
stent implantation. Baseline demographics,
procedural details and follow-up data
were recorded. All treatment and clinical
decision-making processes were subject to
the attending cardiologists.
The study was approved by the
Institutional Ethics Committee of Queen
Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong,
Hong Kong (no. UW 17-026). Written
informed consent was waived by the
Institutional Ethics Committee as this was
a retrospective analysis without any alter-
ation in patient management.
Study endpoints
The primary endpoint was 1-year target
lesion failure (TLF), defined as a composite
of cardiac death, myocardial infarction
(not clearly attributed to a non-target
vessel), or a clinically indicated target
lesion revascularization by percutaneous or
surgical methods at 12 months. All clinical
outcomes were defined according to the
Academic Research Consortium (ARC).4
Deaths were considered cardiac unless an
unequivocal non-cardiac cause could be
established. Secondary endpoints included
individual components of the primary out-
comes: target vessel myocardial infarction;
clinically-driven target lesion revasculariza-
tion (TLR), defined as repeat revasculariza-
tion within the stented segment including
5 mm proximal and distal border zones;
clinically-driven target vessel revasculariza-
tion (TVR) and stent thrombosis defined
according to the ARC as definite, probable,
or possible.4 A revascularization was con-
sidered clinically-driven if repeat angiog-
raphy showed a diameter stenosis !50%
with at least one of the following: (i) history
of recurrent angina pectoris, presumably
related to the target vessel; (ii) objective
signs of ischaemia at rest or during exercise
test by electrocardiogram, presumably
related to the target vessel; (iii) abnormal
test results of invasive functional diagnostic
test (fractional flow reserve); or (iv) a TLR
with a diameter stenosis !70% even in the
absence of the aforementioned ischaemic
signs or symptoms.
Study device
Resolute OnyxTM (Medtronic Inc., Santa
Rosa, CA, USA) is a zotarolimus-eluting
stent designed for higher procedural success
and better acute performance. The design is
based on its predecessor, the ResoluteTM
Integrity drug-eluting stent, which was
extensively studied in the Resolute Global
Clinical Program.3 In brief, the stent is
manufactured using continuous sinusoid
technology that employs a single strand of
wire to form a sinusoidal pattern of crowns,
458 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
which is laser fused at selected crowns. This
distinctive wire-forming facilitates smooth
tracking in tortuous vessels and allows
excellent conformability.5 The drug polymer
BioLinx is highly biocompatible with a
hydrophilic surface designed to minimize
inflammation.6 The polymer elutes the drug
zotarolimus, which is a synthetic analogue
of sirolimus, over 180 days, with >85% of
the zotarolimus dose released by day 60.7
The latest version Resolute OnyxTM utilizes
core-wire technology in which the cobalt
alloy incorporates a platinum iridium core
for increased radiopacity. Moreover, the
strut thickness is further reduced to 81 mm
(0.0032 inches) with maintained radial
strength and the crossing profile is
0.037 mm for the 2.5 mm stent. The
Resolute OnyxTM stents used in patients
included in this registry study ranged from
2.0 mm to 5.0 mm diameters and the stent
lengths were up to 38 mm.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed
using the SPSSÕ statistical package, version
19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Continuous variables are as
mean Æ SD. Categorical values are pre-
sented as absolute values or percentages.
Comparison of continuous data was per-
formed by one-way analysis of variance,
Mann­Whitney U-test or independent-
samples t-test depending on data distribution.
2-test and Fisher's exact test were used
to compare categorical data. A two-sided
P-value of 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
From March 2015 to February 2016, 252
patients were implanted with Resolute
OnyxTM stents. Two patients were lost to
follow-up, so 250 patients completed the
1-year assessment and were entered into this
analysis. A total of 577 Resolute OnyxTM
stents were implanted. Baseline demograph-
ics are presented in Table 1; 89 patients
(35.6%) had type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM), 24 (9.6%) had type 1 diabetes
mellitus and 21 patients (8.4%) with end-
stage renal failure (ESRF) were on dialysis
(haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis).
Interventional procedures and lesion details
are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.
A total of 83 patients (33.2%) presented
with acute coronary syndrome including ST
elevation myocardial infarction and eight
patients (3.2%) had cardiogenic shock. With
regard to lesion characteristics, 38 patients
(15.2%) had left main involvement,
73 (29.2%) had three-vessel disease; and
175 (70.0%) had small vessel diseases
with Resolute OnyxTM 2.5 mm (n ¼ 164),
2.25 mm (n ¼ 111) and 2.0 mm (n ¼ 42)
stents implanted. At 1 year, 228 of 239
surviving patients (95.4%) were on dual
antiplatelet therapy.

Table 4 shows the 1-year clinical out-
comes. The primary endpoint of 1-year TLF
was observed in 11 patients (4.4%). One
patient suffered from ARC probable
subacute stent thrombosis. When patients
were stratified according to vessel size, the
demographics and 1-year clinical outcomes
were similar for patients with and without
small vessel disease (Table 5). Of the 21
patients with ESRF who were receiving
dialysis during the index procedure, five
patients (23.8%) suffered from TLF within
1 year.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
report of the medium-term clinical perform-
ance of the latest evolution of R-ZES, the
Resolute OnyxTM stent. These present data
demonstrated that the Resolute OnyxTM
stent achieved similar efficacy and safety
compared with most contemporary DES
with a 1-year TLF rate of 4.4%.1 In the
Resolute All Comers trial,8 the Resolute
zotarolimus-eluting stent and an everoli-
mus-eluting stent had 1-year TLF rates of
8.2% and 8.3%, respectively. Although this
current retrospective registry has its inherent
limitations, this post-marketing study
allowed the analysis of all patients including

those with ultra-high-risk characteristics.
For example, this current cohort included
patients with cardiogenic shock, patients
with ESRF receiving dialysis, a high pro-
portion of patients with T2DM and even
patients who presented with cardiac arrest
requiring haemodynamic support. This cur-
rent cohort reflects real-world coronary
intervention practices, which is difficult to
study in prospective randomized clinical
trials. In this present study, many of the
TLFs occurred in those ultra-high-risk
patients and this further provides insight
into the use of the Resolute OnyxTM stent in
a real-world population.
In the present study, 45% of patients had
diabetes mellitus and 70% had small vessel
disease. Small vessel stenting has tradition-
ally been associated with higher rates of
restenosis and repeat revascularizations.9,10
The degree of neointimal proliferation is
relatively independent of the reference vessel
size and hence the proportion of cross-
sectional luminal narrowing is higher in
small vessels compared with large vessels.11
The problem is further complicated by the
presence of T2DM that predisposes to
neointimal hyperplasia while patients with
T2DM tend to have diffuse small vessel
disease.12 These current data suggest that
the Resolute OnyxTM stent had similar
outcomes in small and large vessel diseases,
which is similar to its predecessor stent as
demonstrated by the Resolute Global
Clinical Program small vessel subgroup
analysis.13 Even in ultra-small vessels
implanted with a 2.0 mm Resolute OnyxTM
stent, the results were satisfactory and fur-
ther studies will be required to investigate
the optimal treatment of ultra-small vessel
diseases.
Of the patients in the current study who
experienced TLF within 1 year, a significant
proportion were patients with ESRF receiv-
ing dialysis (five of 11 patients). Chronic
kidney disease (CKD) is known to be
associated with increased mortality and
morbidity from coronary artery disease.14
Particularly in those with ESRF on dialysis,
who are frequently excluded from clinical
trials, treatment failures are common after
revascularization no matter whether percu-
taneous coronary intervention (PCI) or cor-
onary bypass grafting are performed.15 Even
with second-generation DES, the 1-year
TLF rate approached 15% and more than
30% needed repeat revascularization in
longer term follow-up.16­18 In this current
registry, five out of 21 ESRF patients (24%)
suffered from TLF within 1 year, which is
quite a high proportion. With the aging
population, increasing prevalence of T2DM,
CKD and better renal support, the incidence
of coronary artery disease in patients
with ESRF is set to increase. Further
advancements in coronary revascularization
technology including PCI and stenting is

imminently needed to address this future
healthcare demand.
This study had several limitations. First,
a lack of a control group prevents compari-
son with other stents. Secondly, the small
sample size and low event rates render
conclusive outcome and independent pre-
dictor analyses difficult. Furthermore, the
retrospective study design was subject to
selection bias, although it allowed recruit-
ment of a real-world PCI practice cohort
and only two patients were lost to follow-up.
In conclusion, the Resolute OnyxTM stent
showed a favourable 1-year clinical per-
formance in a real-world population.
