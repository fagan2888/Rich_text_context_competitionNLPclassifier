Objective To determine the prevalence of smoking among adolescents with asthma and
smoking's psychosocial risk factors (environmental smoking exposure, autonomy, depression).
Method Participants were 2,039 adolescents with asthma and 2,039 matched controls from
the Add Health study. Results The prevalence of ever smoking among adolescents with
asthma was 56%. Among ever smokers with asthma, the prevalence of current smoking was
48%, and the prevalence of current smokers having made a recent attempt to stop smoking was
57%. Having parents who have smoked, exposure to friends who smoke, and depression were
significant psychosocial risk factors for ever smoking. Asthma and exposure to friends who
smoke were significantly associated with current smoking, and attempts to stop smoking were
significantly associated with asthma and depression. Conclusions Psychosocial risk factors
for smoking among adolescents with and without asthma appear similar. Research on the role
of illness in tobacco control is warranted.

Tobacco use has been the leading preventable cause of
death and disease in the United States for decades (McGin-
nis & Foege, 1993; US Department of Health and Human
Services, 2000). This risky behavior is often initiated dur-
ing childhood and adolescence, as more than 70% of adult
smokers report that they started smoking on a daily basis
prior to age 18 (Lynch & Bonnie, 1994). According to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
nearly 64% of high school­aged adolescents nationwide
have ever smoked, and almost 29% are current smokers
(Grunbaum et al., 2002). These and other statistics have
prompted the U.S. Public Health Service to adopt a youth-
centered tobacco control policy advocating increased to-
bacco prevention and intervention programming at the
national, state, and local levels (Lynch & Bonnie, 1994).
Although tobacco use is considered harmful to all
children, adolescents, and adults, there are subgroups for
whom smoking is particularly risky. Included among these
subgroups are persons diagnosed with chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary diseases (COPDs), including asthma. Ac-
cording to a 1997 report issued by the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Insti-
tutes of Health, asthma is an inflammatory disorder of the
airways resulting in frequent episodes of wheezing, breath-
lessness, chest tightening, and coughing. These symptoms
most often begin in childhood, though they can develop
throughout life. In addition to medication, self-management
strategies can successfully control asthma, through such
steps as identifying and avoiding environmental irritants
that trigger or exacerbate asthma symptoms. As tobacco
smoke tops the list of potential irritants, the NHLBI rec-
ommends that persons with asthma not smoke or be ex-
posed to tobacco smoke in their environment.
Unfortunately, several studies have concluded that
the prevalence of smoking among persons with asthma
is the same as the prevalence of smoking among persons
without asthma (Backer, Nepper-Christensen, Ulrik, von
Linstow, & Porsbjerg, 2002; Brook & Shiloh, 1993; Forero,
Bauman, Young, & Larkin, 1992; Martin, Landau, & Phe-
lan, 1982), or in some instances higher (Forero, Bauman,
Young, Booth, & Nutbeam, 1996; Kaplan & Mascie-Taylor,
1989, 1997; Sherman, Tosteson, Tager, Speizer, & Weiss,
1990). Though many possible explanations for this dis-
turbing association exist, the topic has received surprisingly
little empirical attention. In one of the few studies to di-
rectly assess reasons why adolescents with asthma might
be drawn to smoking, Zbikowski, Klesges, Robinson, and
Alfano (2002) examined smoking status and a host of
psychosocial risk factors (approval of smoking, accessi-
bility of cigarettes, value of smoking, rebelliousness, social
support, sadness, stress) among 3,234 adolescents ranging
in age from 15 to 18 years, approximately 16% (n = 505)
of whom had a positive asthma history. In their sample, the
overall prevalence of current smoking was 20%. Adoles-
cents with asthma were significantly more likely to smoke
(17% to 22%) than were those without asthma (17%).
Factors associated with an increased likelihood of smok-
ing did not differ between the two groups, leading to the
conclusion that adolescents with or without asthma may
smoke for similar reasons.
Among the factors affecting the decision to smoke
that have consistently received support in the tobacco
control literature are: (a) one's level of exposure to smok-
ers in the social environment, (b) the degree of parental
oversight or adolescent autonomy in the parent-adolescent
relationship, and (c) an adolescent's level of psychological
distress. For example, exposure to smoking among family
members and among friends has been shown to highly
influence adolescent smoking practices, including initia-
tion of smoking and progression to greater levels of smok-
ing (Chassin, Presson, Rose, & Sherman, 1996; Choi,
Pierce, Gilpin, Farkas, & Berry, 1997; Distefan, Gilpin,
Choi, & Pierce, 1998; Tercyak, Goldman, Smith, &
Audrain, 2002). Wang and colleagues (1999) reported
that parental smoking was associated with a 30% increase
in the likelihood of adolescents becoming current smok-
ers, and the number of friends who smoked was associated
with a 44% increase. Smoking among family members
and friends may increase smoking acceptability and ciga-
rette availability (Flay, 1993; Jackson, Henriksen, Dick-
inson, Messer, & Robertson, 1998), thereby laying a foun-
dation for the adoption of regular smoking.
In terms of autonomy, data suggest that adolescents
with less parental involvement in their day-to-day activi-
ties and thus more decision-making autonomy are more
likely to experiment with tobacco and other drugs (Baum-
rind, 1985; Chilcoat & Anthony, 1996; Cohen, Richardson,
& LaBree, 1994; Griffin, Botvin, Scheier, Diaz, & Miller,
2000). Radziszewska, Richardson, Dent, and Flay (1996)
found that adolescents with unengaged parents (i.e., ado-
lescents high in decision-making autonomy) experienced
the poorest adjustment as indexed by a number of factors
including smoking. This relationship was particularly ro-
bust, as it held up across ethnic, gender, and socioeco-
nomic status groups.
Along with these social factors, psychological distress
has been associated with adolescent smoking as well
(Brown, Lewinsohn, Seeley, & Wagner, 1996; Covey &
Tam, 1990; Patton et al., 1996). Depression, the most
commonly studied form of such distress, has been shown
to be a predictor of smoking initiation (Escobedo, Kirch,
& Anda, 1996), may be associated with nicotine depend-
ence in adolescents (Kassel, 2000), and can have a nega-
tive impact on stopping smoking (Glassman et al., 1990).
In a study by Kandel and Davies (1986), it was found that
lifetime and current smoking were significantly higher in
young adults (ages 24­25 years) who had had elevated
depression symptoms as adolescents (ages 15­16 years).
This suggests that depression may make an individual
vulnerable to initiating smoking and maintain his or her
smoking behavior over time. Indeed, nicotine contained in
cigarettes is a stimulant and may induce feelings of eu-
phoria and relaxation, which could ameliorate depression
symptoms (Anda et al., 1990).
As adolescents with asthma are strongly discouraged
against smoking, and against being around others who
smoke, it remains unclear how these well-established
smoking risk factors might operate in this context. For
example, are adolescents with asthma just as likely as
their peers without asthma to be exposed to parents who
have smoked and/or to socialize with friends who smoke?
Or, are they less likely to experience these influences given
their illness? Further, because self-management strategies
are a critical element of asthma control, one might expect
to see increased decision-making autonomy in the rela-
tionships of adolescents with asthma with their parents.
While some degree of autonomy is likely to be beneficial
in terms of caring for asthma symptoms, the autonomy
of these adolescents might also extend to other behav-
iors, including tobacco use, that are more risky. Adoles-
cents with asthma often strive to maximize their autonomy
(Randolph & Fraser, 1999), and smoking is viewed by
adolescents as a means to achieve it (Grube, Rokeach, &
Getzlaf, 1990; Nichter, Nichter, Vuckovic, Quintero, &
Ritenbaugh, 1997). And finally, since some adolescents
with asthma experience psychological distress related to
their illness (Creer & Bender, 1995), this too might in
turn affect their smoking risk.
In addition to these questions, there are uncertain-
ties about attempts to stop smoking made by adolescents
with asthma who currently smoke. Not all adolescents
who smoke wish to continue to do so, and many regret
496 Tercyak
starting. According to the 1989 Teenage Attitudes and
Practices Survey, nearly three-quarters of youth who smoke
had seriously considered stopping smoking and almost
one-half made a recent attempt to stop (CDC, 1994,
p. 120). In 2001, 57% of adolescent current smokers
nationwide had tried to stop smoking within the past
year (Grunbaum et al., 2002). Data from adult current
smokers with asthma suggest that the prevalence of
their recent attempts to stop smoking is similar to that
of current smokers without asthma (Wakefield, Ruffin,
Campbell, Roberts, & Wilson, 1995). But at present, no
data on the prevalence of attempts to stop smoking among
adolescents with asthma are available. Further, it is un-
known how the psychosocial risk factors mentioned above
might deter or promote attempts to stop among adoles-
cents with asthma relative to their peers without asthma.
O'Byrne, Haddock, and Poston (2002) found autonomy in
the parent-adolescent relationship to be positively asso-
ciated with adolescents' attempts to stop smoking, sug-
gesting that further research in this area is warranted.
In light of these issues, the goals of the present study
were to: (a) determine the prevalence of lifetime and cur-
rent cigarette smoking and recent attempts to stop smok-
ing among adolescents with asthma, (b) compare these
prevalence estimates with those of adolescents without
asthma, and (c) explore potential psychosocial risk fac-
tors for smoking in these youth, compared with adoles-
cents without asthma. Consistent with the prior litera-
ture, it was hypothesized that adolescents with asthma
would be more likely to smoke relative to their peers with-
out asthma despite the fact that smoking is strongly con-
traindicated among adolescents with asthma. It was further
hypothesized that exposure to environmental cigarette
smoking (i.e., smoking among parents and friends), greater
decision-making autonomy, and greater symptoms of de-
pression would be positively associated with smoking and
negatively associated with recent attempts to stop smok-
ing, as they are key factors shown to be related to tobacco
use in prior literature.
Method
All data for this study were obtained through a contractual
arrangement with the proprietors of the National Longi-
tudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) Wave I
dataset (Carolina Population Center, 1998). Some ado-
lescents enrolled in the Add Health study and their parents
completed extensive in-home interviews about adoles-
cent health and well-being (Udry & Bearman, 1998). This
included information about exercise and physical activ-
ity; drug, alcohol, and tobacco use; hereditary conditions
of health; physical disabilities; mental health; and chronic
health problems. As such, the Add Health study offers pe-
diatric psychology an unprecedented opportunity to iden-
tify the prevalence of tobacco use and other health be-
haviors within a large and well-defined population of
adolescents.
Participants
During the parent in-home interview of Wave I (conducted
from September 1994 through December 1995), parents re-
ported on a number of parent-, child-, and family-specific
factors, including whether the child was currently expe-
riencing the health problem of asthma or emphysema
(yes/no). Based upon parents' response to these questions,
2,073 adolescents were identified. The in-home interview
did not distinguish between asthma and emphysema as
different forms of COPD. However, it is assumed that the
majority of affected adolescents were diagnosed with
asthma and not emphysema, as emphysema usually de-
velops in adulthood, often after many years of exposure to
cigarette smoke and other air pollutants.
Adolescents included in the control sample were ran-
domly selected via a computer program from the Wave I
dataset after the cases of adolescents with asthma had
been identified. The computer program sought to exactly
match controls to cases on four vital statistics: (a) gen-
der (male or female), (b) race (Hispanic, black/African
American, Asian, Native American, other, white), (c) age
(11 to 21 years), and (d) the U.S. census region in which
the school the adolescent attended was located (West,
Midwest, South, Northeast). A total of 2,039 out of 2,051
cases (99%) could be matched in this manner. Limita-
tions in the Add Health study dataset prevented a complete
determination of the health status of these controls, other
than that they did not have asthma. However, adolescents
with diabetes (n = 78) could be excluded prior to the se-
lection of the sample of controls as the Wave I in-home
parent interview asked parents to identify whether their
adolescent was affected with diabetes.
Procedure
In the Add Health study, the sampling frame included all
high schools in the U.S. meeting certain eligibility criteria
(N = 26,666). A systematic random sample of 80 high
schools and 52 middle schools was then selected with un-
equal probability of selection for participation. Incor-
porating systematic sampling methods and implicit strat-
ification into the Add Health study design ensured that
the sample was representative of U.S. schools with respect

to region of country, urbanicity, school type, ethnicity, and
school size. Overall, 79% of schools agreed to participate
(Resnick et al., 1997).
Measures
All of the following variables/scales were extracted/
created from the Wave I adolescent in-home interview.
Environmental Smoking Exposure. As exposure to smok-
ing among family members and friends has been shown to
be strongly associated with adolescent cigarette experi-
mentation and continued use, two items assessing resi-
dent mother and resident father lifetime cigarette smoking
(yes/no) and one item assessing the number of best friends
who smoke at least one cigarette per day (none, one, two,
or three) were included in the analysis.
Decision-making Autonomy. Greater autonomy in decision
making has been shown to be positively related to tobacco,
alcohol, and other drug use in community samples of ado-
lescents. As such, a decision-making autonomy scale was
constructed from seven yes/no items that asked adoles-
cents whether or not they viewed their parents as letting
adolescents make their own decisions about curfew, friends,
clothing, television watching, and daily routines. On this
scale, higher scores indicated greater autonomy. The multi-
item scale creation process followed the example of Siev-
ing et al. (2001), which is recommended when using Add
Heath data. The decision-making autonomy scale had an
internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) reliability of .63.
Depression Symptoms. Resnick et al. (1997) created a
reliable (Cronbach alpha .73) multi-item scale of psy-
chological distress/depression symptoms over the pre-
ceding week for the Add Health dataset. This 19-item, 3-
point Likert scale (0 = never or rarely, 1 = sometimes, 2 = a
lot of the time, 3 = most of the time or all of the time) is
based, in large part, on the Center for Epidemiologic Stud-
ies Depression Scale (Radloff, 1977), which is commonly
used with adolescents (Myers & Winters, 2002); higher
scores indicated greater depression symptoms. Items in-
clude "You felt depressed" and "You felt sad."
Tobacco Use. Adolescent tobacco use was assessed by a
series of standard epidemiological items regarding life-
time and current cigarette smoking and recent attempts to
stop smoking. These items included: "Have you ever tried
cigarette smoking, even just 1 or 2 puffs?" "During the
past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke ciga-
rettes?" "During the past 6 months, have you tried to quit
smoking cigarettes?"
For the purposes of the data analysis, three succes-
sive tobacco-use outcome variables were created. The first
variable divided the entire sample into those adolescents
who either had or had not reported a positive lifetime his-
tory of ever having tried cigarette smoking ("ever smoker").
Among those who reported they had ever smoked, these
adolescents were further subdivided into those who were
current smokers (those who had smoked cigarettes on 5 or
more days within the past 30 days) and those who were
not. As there is no consensus in the published literature on
the most acceptable definition of adolescent current smok-
ing (Kaufman et al., 2002; Grunbaum et al., 2002; Lloyd-
Richardson, Papandonatos, Kazura, Stanton, & Niaura,
2002; Zbikowski, Klesges, Robinson, & Alfano, 2002), a
relatively stringent definition was applied. Finally, among
current smokers only, the 6-month prevalence of having
made at least one attempt to stop smoking was deter-
mined by adolescents' responses to the single yes/no item.
Data Analysis
The first step in the data analysis was to describe the de-
mographic characteristics of the sample (see Table I).
Next, univariate analyses (frequency counts) were used
to determine the prevalence of tobacco use outcomes (ever
smoking, current smoking, and recent stop-smoking at-
tempt). Bivariate analyses (chi-square tests and Student t
tests) tested for differences in these outcomes among the
illness status, demographic, smoking exposure, auton-
omy, and depression variables. In addition to illness status,
variables with significant (p < .05) associations at the bi-
variate level were then tested in a multivariate fashion us-
ing logistic regression. These equations generated odds
ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) in order to esti-
mate the variable's influence on the likelihood of an ado-
lescent being an ever smoker, a current smoker, and/or
having made a recent attempt to stop smoking.
Results
Univariate Analyses
Fifty-six percent of the total sample of adolescents was
classified as ever smokers; the prevalence of ever smoking
among adolescents with and without asthma was identical.
Among ever smokers overall, 45% were classified as cur-
rent smokers; the prevalence of current smoking was 48%
among adolescents with asthma (42% among adolescents
without asthma). Among current smokers overall, 53%
had made a recent stop-smoking attempt (57% among
current smokers with asthma, 49% among current smok-
ers without asthma) (see Table II).
Bivariate Analyses
As shown in Table II, older and white adolescents, t(3,
612) = ­9.7 and X2(1) = 54.9, respectively, were more
likely to be ever smokers than were younger and non-
498 Tercyak
white adolescents. In addition, adolescents exposed to
mothers, X2(1) = 71.4, fathers, X2(1) = 89.7, and friends
who smoked, t(3, 889) = ­24.3, as well those with higher
levels of decision-making autonomy and depression, t(3,
661) = ­6.7 and t(3, 985) = ­8.6, respectively, were also
more likely to be ever smokers compared with adoles-
cents who had little or no exposure to these influences.
In terms of current smoking, a similar pattern of find-
ings to the ones noted above emerged, with the inclusion
of adolescents with asthma being more likely to be current
smokers relative to adolescents without asthma, X2(1) = 5.5.
With respect to recent stop-smoking attempts, only ill-
ness status and depression yielded significant findings.
Specifically, adolescent current smokers with asthma were
more likely to have made at least one attempt to stop
smoking compared with adolescent current smokers with-
out asthma, X2(1) = 5.0, and adolescent current smokers
with elevated levels of depression were more likely to have
attempted to stop smoking compared with those with
moderate levels of these symptoms, t(754) = ­2.9.
Multivariate Analyses
The results of the multivariate analyses of the tobacco use
outcomes are presented in Table III. To ease their inter-
pretation in these models, the two parental smoking his-
tory variables were combined into a single variable repre-
senting whether either the resident mother, father, or both
parents were ever smokers (yes), and this was contrasted
to cases where neither the mother nor the father ever
smoked (no). Similarly, exposure to smoking among friends
was dichotomized as 0 (no friends who smoke) versus 1
(one or more friends who smoke). And finally, a median-
split procedure was performed on the continuous scores of
the decision-making autonomy and depression scales to

create groups of adolescents with low and high autonomy
and low and high depression.
After controlling for the effects of age and race, sig-
nificant predictors of ever smoking were exposure to par-
ents who had ever smoked, smoking among friends, and
depression. Specifically, parental smoking was associated
with a 70% increase in the likelihood of being an ever
smoker, friends' smoking was associated with a threefold
increase, and high symptoms of depression was associ-
ated with a 40% increase. Among ever smokers, illness
status and smoking among friends were strongly associated
with being a current smoker, after the effects of age and
race were controlled for; having asthma was associated
with a 30% increase in the likelihood of current smok-
ing, and exposure to one or more friends who smoked
was associated with a sevenfold increase in the likelihood
of being a current smoker. With respect to current smok-
ers' attempts to stop smoking, adolescents with asthma
were 40% more likely to have made at least one attempt
within the past 6 months, and adolescents with high
depression were 50% more likely to have made at least
one attempt. The interactions between illness status and
each psychosocial risk factor tested in these models were
nonsignificant.
Discussion
Study results suggest that the prevalence rate of ever smok-
ing among adolescents with asthma was 56%. Among ever
smokers with asthma, the prevalence rate of current smok-
ing was 48%. Comparable prevalence rates among ado-
lescents enrolled in the Add Health study without asthma
were 56% for ever smoking and 42% for current smok-
ing.1 The data indicate that adolescents with asthma were
just as likely to experiment with smoking in their life-
times as were adolescents without asthma. The data also
indicate that adolescents with asthma were significantly
more likely to be current smokers than their peers without
asthma. While both of these findings are of concern, the
latter is perhaps more troubling, as it suggests that asthma,
in and of itself, may be a risk factor for more advanced
forms of tobacco use.
The results of multivariate analyses imply that the
psychosocial risk factors for ever smoking were similar
among adolescents with and without asthma. There are
several possible explanations as to why these risk factors
may be operating in the observed manner. It might be
that adolescents with asthma are psychologically reacting
against the self-management of their illness by engaging in
a risky behavior known to negatively impact their asthma
control. Other work has shown that risk taking and re-
belliousness are positively associated with current smok-
ing among adolescents with asthma (Zbikowski et al.,
2002). Further, Creer and Bender (1995) note that rates of
nonadherence to the pediatric asthma regimen can be as
high as 70%, and that nonadherence among pediatric
asthma patients has been viewed as an attempt to assume
greater control over their illness. Though these statements
regarding nonadherence are meant to apply to medica-
tion usage, when combined with the data on risk taking
and rebelliousness, it might reflect a general tendency

among some adolescents with asthma to engage in other
health-compromising behaviors, including tobacco use.
Another possibility is that adolescents with asthma
experience greater levels of psychological distress, and
that cigarette smoking represents one (albeit unhealthy)
way in which adolescents cope with this distress. Indeed,
when Forero and colleagues (1996) reported on the health
behaviors of a large community-based sample of Aus-
tralian adolescents with asthma, they found that both to-
bacco and alcohol use were highest among adolescents
with asthma, and that these adolescents also reported el-
evated psychological distress. Nevertheless, the results of
the present study do not support the relationship between
distress and tobacco use, as depression was not signifi-
cantly related to an increased likelihood of current smok-
ing (p = .16). Zbikowski et al. (2002) also did not find
that adolescents with asthma smoked to relieve distress;
only adolescents without asthma were more likely to be
current smokers as a result of their beliefs that smoking
was relaxing. Also contrary to the hypothesis, the pres-
ent study did not find support for the relationship be-
tween autonomy in decision making and tobacco use
when other factors were controlled for.
Perhaps the most intriguing finding pertains to at-
tempts to stop smoking among current smokers. Both ill-
ness status and depression were positively associated with
having made a recent attempt to stop. It is encouraging that
adolescents with asthma were 40% more likely to try to
stop smoking, but, given the addictiveness of tobacco, it is
not surprising to find that their attempts were unsuc-
cessful. In the adult literature, there is little relation be-
tween previous attempts to stop smoking and the proba-
bility of success on a current attempt (Cohen et al., 1989);
for adolescents, multiple attempts are common and should
be viewed as beneficial in that they are likely to lead to
eventual success in remaining abstinent over time (Burt &
Peterson, 1998).
Interestingly, the presence of high depression was
positively associated with attempts to stop smoking. It is
possible that adolescent smokers regretted having started
smoking, which partly gave rise to their distress and may
have motivated their stop attempt. However, as their at-
tempt was unsuccessful, this distress may, in turn, have in-
hibited their ability to stop. These data suggest that the role
of depression in stopping smoking among adolescents is
complex, possibly serving both motivational and inhibitory
functions.
Regarding the limitations of this work, it is important
to keep in mind that the Add Health study did not distin-
guish asthma from emphysema as different forms of COPD,
and more detailed health and diagnostic information were
unavailable. As such, the true extent of adolescents' asthma
severity cannot be determined. It was also assumed that
parental reports of asthma diagnoses were reliable and
valid, and that the majority of affected adolescents were di-
agnosed with asthma and not emphysema given the ill-
nesses' trajectories, though this too could not be confirmed.
Further, though the multi-item scale creation process fol-
lowed the example of Sieving et al. (2001), which is rec-
ommended when using Add Health data, the validity of the
decision-making autonomy and depression scales is lim-
ited. In addition, changing patterns in the prevalence of
smoking among U.S. high school students since the time
these data were collected in the mid-1990s also limit the
application of these findings. Finally, the cross-sectional na-
ture of this work limited the ability to draw conclusions
about the directional nature of the relationships observed.
For example, in this study it was not possible to deter-
mine if asthma caused smoking or vice versa. However, it
is more likely than not that the diagnosis of asthma pre-
ceded the onset of tobacco use. That is because asthma
is most often first identified in childhood, whereas a ma-
jority of cigarette smoking occurs during adolescence
(Lynch & Bonnie, 1994; NHLBI, 1997). Nevertheless, the
role of tobacco as a causal factor in the onset of asthma re-
mains a possibility (Backer et al., 2002; Larsson, 1995). In
the future, additional waves of Add Health data should
be able to answer these questions more fully.
The implications of this study for the control of to-
bacco use among adolescents, especially those with asthma,
are clear: All should be discouraged from smoking, and
professional assistance in stopping smoking should be
provided to those who have started. Tobacco use is highly
contraindicated among adolescents with asthma (NHLBI,
1997). Recommendations to educate and counsel patients
with asthma about the risks of smoking, and the benefits
of stopping, have been included in several professional
groups' clinical practice guidelines and policy statements,
including those of the American Academy of Pediatrics
(AAP, 1998) and the Society for Adolescent Medicine
(Rosen, Elster, Hedberg, & Paperny, 1997). In the con-
text of adolescent health care visits, such education and
counseling can be accomplished by incorporating into
standard care the "5 A's for brief intervention" (Commit-
tee on Substance Abuse, 2001; Fiore et al., 2000). These in-
clude: asking all adolescents about tobacco use at every
health care visit; advising all tobacco users to stop smok-
ing; assessing their willingness to make a stop-smoking
attempt; assisting them in stopping (via behavioral coun-
seling, pharmacotherapy, or both); and arranging follow-
up. Klein, Levine, and Allan (2001) reported that the ma-
jority of adolescent health care providers ask their
Tobacco Use Among Adolescents with Asthma 501
adolescent patients about smoking, and most assess ado-
lescents' motivation to stop smoking. However, fewer
provide assistance or arrange follow-up. Preliminary data
suggest that pharmacotherapy can be safely provided to
adolescent smokers (Smith et al., 1996), though addi-
tional research is necessary. As behavioral counseling to
promote stopping smoking among adolescents often in-
cludes an emphasis on understanding the social influ-
ences of smoking, providing coping skills training, and
identifying other, healthier sources of reward (Sussman,
Lichtman, Ritt, & Pallonen, 1999), this mode of inter-
vention seems particularly relevant for those with asthma
in light of the psychosocial risk factors identified herein.
The results of this study confirm that adolescents
with asthma are at least as likely to be ever smokers as
are adolescents without asthma, and are more likely to be
current smokers. Adolescents with asthma are more likely
to attempt to stop smoking, and these tobacco outcomes
are mediated by psychosocial risk factors. Hence, addi-
tional research on the role of illness in tobacco control is
necessary, including ways to incorporate tobacco use pre-
vention and intervention into the care of adolescents with
asthma.

Note
1 In Wave I of the Add Health study, the overall
prevalence of smoking on 5 or more days within the past
30 days was approximately 45%. In 1995, the prevalence of
current smoking (defined as smoking 1 cigarette within
the past 30 days) was approximately 35% overall; in 2001,
the prevalence of current smoking was approximately 29%
overall (www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dash/yrbs/about_yrbss.htm).
Thus, the current smoking prevalence estimate was actu-
ally lower than norms circa 1995, but this is likely due to
the more stringent definition of current smoking applied to
this dataset.
