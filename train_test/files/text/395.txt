Abstract: A theoretical review provides a rationale for examining self-
agency as a developmental foundation underlying processes of self-regulated
change and a potential moderator of intervention effectiveness among
participants in a nurse home-visitation program. Self-agency is defined as
the conceptual understanding of self as an agent capable of shaping motives,
behavior, and future possibilities (Damon & Hart, 1991). Availability of a
sample of 186 mothers who received nurse home visitation provided an
opportunity to test the relationship between participant self-agency and
enactment of targeted health behaviors. Self-agency items from the Pearlin
Mastery Scale (1978) were used to differentiate mothers who endorsed self-
agency from those who did not. Consistent with the theoretical premise,
mothers who endorsed self-agency at an established threshold were
significantly more likely to enact health behaviors promoted during nurse
visitation. Results provide support for the relationship between the develop-
ment of self-agency and enactment of health behaviors targeted by a nurse
home-visitation program. ß 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Res Nurs Health 26:20­29,

A primary aim of programs of health promotion

Programs of nurse home visitation for at-risk
mothers target health promotion in the areas of
maternal and child health and development. These
programs strive to help mothers change their
behavior in such areas as substance abuse, rapid
successive pregnancies, and neglectful parenting
(Olds et al., 1998). An extensive body of research
supports the efficacy of nurse home visitation
(Gomby, Culross, & Behrman, 1999). Yet not all
mothers who participate in these programs utilize

the interventions to realize the desired changes in
health behaviors. The next generation of research
on nurse home visitation is focused on under-
standing patterns of differential intervention utili-
zation and effectiveness (Korfmacher, Kitzman,
& Olds, 1998). This type of research includes
returning to intervention group data in an effort
to identify characteristics that differentiate sub-
groups of intervention ``responders'' from ``non-
responders'' (Barnard et al., 1988; Cole, Kitzman,
Olds, & Sidora, 1998; Olds & Korfmacher, 1998;
Osofsky, Culp, & Ware, 1988).
Theoretically derived constructs are needed
to help researchers focus on characteristics that
hold promise in predicting the readiness and/or
ability of participants to benefit from designed
interventions. The aim of this study was to test the
construct of self-agency as a potential moderator
of intervention effectiveness when interventions
are directed toward a purposeful change in health
behavior.
Among the common themes in literature on
behavior change, those relevant to this study
include: (a) the developmental readiness to envi-
sion a future self and recognize the capacity for
self-agency and self-regulated change (Damon &
Hart, 1982, 1991; Demetriou, 2000; Rubin, 1984;
Zimmerman, 2000), (b) the influence of social
contexts on self-agency development (Emde,
1990; MacLeod, 1995; Maslow, 1970; Winnicott,
1965), and (c) the qualities of relationships that
inspire hope that change is possible (Beitman,
1987; Emde; Howard, Lueger, Maling, & Marti-
novich, 1993) and offer the supportive scaffold-
ing and tools for behavior change (Beitman;
Demetriou; Prochaska & Norcross, 1994; Rubin,
1984).
The source of self-regulated behavior change
has been attributed to transformations in the indi-
vidual's conceptualization of self (Bandura, 1977,
1997; Damon & Hart, 1991; Katakis,1989; Markus
& Nurius, 1986; Rotter, 1966; Zimmerman, 2000).
Damon and Hart's (1982, 1991) theory of self-
understanding offers a developmental explanation
for self-transformations that bring about the re-
adiness to engage in processes of self-regulated
change. They view self-understanding as a domain
of social-cognitive knowledge; cognitive repre-
sentations of self are constructed within a social
context. Damon and Hart found evidence of the
developmental basis for self-understanding by
studyingtheself-definitionsofchildrenandadoles-
cents. They reported that children's definitions of
self acquire greater organization, complexity, and
differentiation as they progress from early child-
hood to late adolescence. Self-agency is a char-
acteristic of self-understanding that first appears in
the definitions of young adolescents. Self-agency
is defined as the conceptual understanding of self
as an agent capable of shaping motives, behavior,
and future possibilities. The capacity for abstract
thinking, associated with cognitive development
during adolescence, makes possible the awareness
of a continuous self, existing from the past into
the future. This sense of self-continuity allows
the individual to envision a future self that is the
culmination of current motivations, intentions,
and actions.
The realization of self-agency assumes the
capacity for the self-regulatory skills of fore-
thought,self-instruction,self-monitoring,andself-
reflection (Zimmerman, 2000). Demetriou (2000)
located the emergence of the capacity for self-
regulating cognitions within the adolescent stage
of development, a view consistent with Damon
and Hart's (1991) findings relative to self-agency.
However, Damon and Hart allowed that not all
adolescents endorse a belief in self-agency; the
self-definitionsofsomeadolescentsretaintheview
that forces beyond their control largely determine
their behavior and life circumstances. Sociocultu-
ral differences in endorsement of self-agency have
been documented by researchers applying Damon
and Hart's theory (Damon, Hart, & Levitt, 1991;
Hart & Edelstein, 1992). Their findings are con-
sistent with a social-cognitive perspective of de-
velopment; although stages of development may
be associated with age-typical characteristics
across individuals, variability in experience and
opportunity in a social context can account for
differences in how developmental potential is
realized. In particular, the development of higher-
order self-representations during adolescence
depends on social scaffolding that supplies the
necessary support, experience, and instruction
(Harter, 1999).
Social context contributes to self-development
through the provision of basic needs, facilitative
relationships, social norms, and opportunities.
Maslow's theory of the hierarchical nature of
human needs established the potency of basic,
lower-order needs for survival, safety, and security
(1970). According to Maslow, living situations in
which disrupted physical, economic, and emo-
tional states persist over time may evoke a more
or less continuous activation and arousal of basic
needs and affects. Winnicott's (1965) theory of
emotional development within facilitative envir-
onments supplied a link in understanding the rela-
tionship between the arousal of basic needs and
processes of self-development. Winnicott identi-
fied qualities of facilitative environments that
RELATION BETWEEN SELF-AGENCY AND HEALTH BEHAVIORS/DESOCIO ET AL. 21
promote self-development as a sense of ``going-
on-being.'' He identified a state called the quiet
continuity of experience, a time when needs are
adequately met and an individual is free from
physiological impingement; this is an essential
state, according to Winnicott, in which individuals
become aware of the ongoing nature of self. Suf-
ficient periods of low-key sensations encourage
awareness of the continuity of self through time
and space, from past to future. In contrast, when
basic needs are aroused, they take center stage
and may evoke intense affects that interrupt this
smooth, continuous sense of self. The pull of
attention toward basic, lower-order needs may
confine the individual to a reactive, ``now time''
orientation that temporarily, or more or less con-
tinuously, distracts him or her from processes of
ongoing self-development.
Beyond the immediate and disruptive impact of
unmet needs, an impoverished social environment
may impose a more insidious influence on self-
agency by eroding individual aspirations. Accord-
ing to Bourdieu (1972, 1977), the ``habitus,'' or the
social context to which individuals belong and
affiliate, conditions their thoughts, perceptions,
and actions by a common code of understanding
and experience. These common experiences in-
form group members in many subtle ways about
what they can do or cannot do, what is possible or
not possible, and what is beyond any chance of
success. An individual's aspirations for self are
thus conditioned by the norms of his or her most
familiar social groups, the family and neighbor-
hood, long before these expectations are brought
into personal consideration as an aspect of self-
agency. MacLeod (1995) identified the tendency
of individual adolescents to reproduce and defend
the aspirations of those in their social group as the
most reasonable possibilities for their own lives.
Social contexts associated with poverty and social
disadvantage thus may provide life experiences
that stifle personal aspirations and negate beliefs
in one's ability to purposefully change future out-
comes through self-effort.
Emde's position (1990) is of particular rele-
vance in considering the possibility that lack of
self-agency may result from suppressed aspi-
rations and thwarted opportunities in socially
disadvantaged environments. Emde defines de-
velopment as an integrative process that is con-
tinuously organizing toward higher levels of
complexity and self-differentiation throughout
life. When faced with difficult life circumstances,
an individual's development may be blocked but
can be remobilized at a later point given an ap-
propriate facilitative context. According to Emde,
empathic availability is the hallmark of relation-
ships capable of mobilizing individual develop-
ment. Empathic availability also inspires a sense
of hope that change is possible (Beitman, 1987;
Emde; Howard et al., 1993).
Empathic relationships provide the scaffolding
that engenders self-development, but to experi-
ence the capacity for self-agency, individuals also
need the tools of purposeful behavior. One such
tool is language, a sufficiently well-developed
vocabulary for defining and differentiating self.
Demetriou (2000) emphasized the importance
of self-regulating language in private, internal
speech. Internal dialogue is used to focus one's
attention and provide self-instruction in the per-
formance of purposeful behavior. Rubin (1984)
identified the importance of language in formulat-
ing an image of a future self, to which purposeful
action is directed. According to Rubin, mental
representations that have not been transformed
into language remain inaccessible to productive
problem solving. ``When language is inadequate,
ambiguous, or vague, the [internal] dialogue can
be circularly repetitive, frustrating in its amor-
phousness and in its nonproductive consumption
of energy'' (p. 12). It is through dialogue with
others that amorphous hopes and possibilities
are brought into language for the purpose of
speech and thereby made accessible to cognitive
processes. Relationships offer the context for
giving and receiving the language of self-under-
standing, which is necessary to envision and
commit to a desired future self.
Although language to define self is necessary,
it is not sufficient to realize goals. When a child
says, ``I want to be an astronaut'', he or she is
already using language to describe a future self-
possibility, but speaking of this possibility does
not necessarily make it so. Beitman (1987) and
Prochaska, Redding, and Evers (1997) identified
the value of structured activities that facilitate
processes of behavior change. Such activities
include opportunities to envision possibilities for
self,formulategoals,deviseplans,preparethrough
cognitive review, practice behavior in context, and
evaluate the effectiveness of behavior.
Beitman (1987) and Katakis (1989) suggested
a final requisite for relationships that foster self-
responsibility in the processes of behavior change.
The individual must locate the source of change as
emanating from self, apart from the facilitative
other and the relationship that provided the sup-
portive scaffolding for change. This prepares
the individual to act with conviction in his or her
own capacity and responsibility for self-regulated
change.
22 RESEARCH IN NURSING & HEALTH
From this review of literature it can be postulated
that self-agency is engendered when individuals
with developmental readiness experience social
norms, opportunities, and relationships that pro-
mote the understanding of self as a purposeful
agent capable of shaping future possibilities.
Environments that supply adequate provisions,
facilitative relationships, and opportunities to
exercise self-influence can prompt and mobilize
the development of self-agency. In contrast, envi-
ronments that suppress aspirations and threaten
basic needs can impinge on self-development by
evoking disruptive emotional states and limiting
opportunities. Without the development of self-
agency, individuals may continue to subscribe to
beliefs that external forces and circumstances be-
yond their control largely determine what happens
in their lives. If self-agency is fundamental to
purposeful action, then the development of self-
agency may predict the readiness of individuals to
benefit from interventions that target a purposeful
change in health behaviors.
Although the role of self-agency per se in
affecting behavior change has not been widely
investigated in the literature on nurse home visi-
tation for maternal and child health, researchers
have reported a number of maternal characteristics
that moderate participant engagement and inter-
vention utilization. Their findings support the
importance of factors associated with self-agency
development: maternal age and developmental
readiness, supportive relationships, and facilita-
tive social contexts. For example, Osofsky, Culp,
and Ware (1988) reported that young mothers (age
16 and younger), by definition developmentally
immature, were those least likely to engage in a
nurse visitation intervention.
Olds and Korfmacher (1998) identified a com-
posite of maternal psychological resources that
predicted intervention participation. The compo-
site offactors included maternal IQ, mental health,
coping skills, and self-efficacy. Some factors,
such as coping skills and self-efficacy, may have a
developmental basis, thus lending support to the
idea of developmental readiness underlying the
processes of intervention utilization. A quadratic
relationship between maternal psychological re-
sources and intervention participation was identi-
fied from the results of this study: as psychological
resources increased, intervention participation
decreased, but as maternal psychological re-
sources reached a high level, participation again
increased.
The role of supportive relationships in inter-
vention utilization was investigated by Barnard
et al. (1988). These researchers identified a sub-
group of mothers who were more likely to realize
targeted outcomes when the intervention was
delivered through a supportive relationship with
the nurse. Mothers with lower IQs and fewer social
skills demonstrated greater gains from a mental
health model of intervention that emphasized
relationship development than in a model that
focused primarily on providing information and
resources. In contrast, mothers with higher IQs
and better social skills fared better with an
information-based model of intervention.
Cole et al. (1998) examined social context as
a condition influencing intervention utilization.
They found that family structure influenced the
likelihood that mothers would bring about healthy
changes in their home environments. Mothers
whose family structures were complex, with
many adults and children sharing the same house-
hold, experienced less freedom and had less
authority to make the changes in the home envi-
ronment that were encouraged by the nurse home
visitor.
Thus, the literature on this subject, both theore-
tical and intervention, supports the examination of
self-agency as a participant characteristic that
might distinguish which individuals respond to
interventions that promote a purposeful change in
health behaviors. The aim of our study was to test
the role of self-agency in the enactment of health
behaviors targeted by intervention, using existing
data from one program of nurse home-visitation
research.
Availability of data from the New Mothers'
Home Visitation Study in Memphis, Tennessee
(Kitzman & Olds, 1990), allowed us to test
the theorized relationship between participant
self-agency and enactment of health behaviors.
We examined program outcomes targeted in the
Memphis study and identified two outcomes
(subsequent pregnancies and maternal responsive-
ness) in which mothers could reasonably exercise
control through purposeful effort. We set forth
hypotheses to test the relationship between
maternal self-agency and the enactment of these
outcomes. We predicted that self-agency would
moderate a mother's response to interventions that
targeted purposeful change in health behaviors
and thereby would contribute to differential out-
comes among mothers within the intervention
group. We hypothesized that mothers who had
achieved a clinically relevant threshold of self-
agency at intake would demonstrate a significantly
greater probability of enacting the outcomes of:
(a) delaying subsequent pregnancies at least
through the second birthdays of their infants and
(b) displaying responsive maternal behavior.

METHOD
Research Design and Sample
The primary study from which data were used for
the secondary analysis was conducted in 1990.
Pregnant women ( 28 weeks gestation) with no
previous live births were recruited from a public
health clinic in Memphis. To be in the socially
disadvantaged sample group, women had to meet
at least two of these three criteria: (a) be un-
married, (b) have less than 12 years of education,
and (c) be unemployed. Eleven hundred and
thirty-nine women were enrolled in the study
and randomly assigned to one of four groups.
Groups 1 and 2 were designated as the control
groups: group 1 received free transportation to the
clinic for prenatal care; and group 2 received both
free transportation and developmental screening/
referral for their children at 6, 12, and 24 months of
age. Groups 3 and 4 were the intervention groups:
group 3 received free transportation and devel-
opmental screening plus intensive nurse home
visitations throughout their pregnancies; and
group 4 (n ¼ 224) received the same services as
group 3, with the intensive nurse home visitations
continuing until their infants' second birthdays
(Kitzman et al., 1997).
Consistent with our purpose, to determine
whether self-agency was associated with out-
comes targeted by intervention, only data from
mothers in group 4, one of the intervention groups,
were used for this analysis. After elimination of
mothers for whom there were missing data on the
variables of interest, the secondary analysis was
conducted on data from 186 mothers. All these
mothers had received intensive nurse home visi-
tation from 28 weeks of pregnancy through
infant age of 2 years. Table 1 displays demo-
graphic data for the 186 mothers at the time of
enrollment in the primary study.
Description of the Nurse
Home-Visitation Intervention
Interventions for the New Mothers' Home Visi-
tation Program are described in manualized proto-
cols. In total, 57 nurse visits were prescribed for the
Memphis study: 12 visits during pregnancy, 25
visits during the child's first year, and 20 visits
during the child's second year (Kitzman &
Olds, 1989). Interventions were delivered through
a purposeful relationship between the visiting
nurse and new mother directed toward increasing
the mother's sense of competence in achieving life
goals and realizing healthy outcomes for herself
and her baby. Among the healthy behaviors pro-
moted through nurse visitation were planning sub-
sequent pregnancies and engaging in behaviors to
promote the infant's social and emotional devel-
opment. Mothers received information about the
value of playing and talking with their babies and
respondingtotheiremotionalneeds.Nursesmodel-
ed ways torecognize and respond toinfantcuesand
encouraged mothers to report their experiences in
responding to their infants. Each visit ended with a
review of goals and plans for practicing healthy
behaviors before the next visit, and the subsequent
visit began with a review of activities directed
toward these goals. Program outcomes addressed
three areas of maternal functioning: (a) health-
related behaviors during pregnancy and early child
development, (b) maternal responsiveness and
parenting, and (c) the mother's life course devel-
opment through education, employment, and delay
of future pregnancies. Additional details about the
New Mothers' Home Visitation Program may be
found in earlier publications from this program of
research (Kitzman et al., 1997; Olds et al., 1998;
Olds & Kitzman, 1993).
Measures
Self-agency. For this analysis we adopted
Damon and Hart's (1982, 1991) definition of self-
agency as a developmentally based transforma-
tion in conceptualizing self as a purposeful agent
capable of shaping motives, actions, and future
possibilities. We examined instruments from the
Memphis study to determine if scales or items
were consistent with this definition of self-agency.
The Pearlin Mastery Scale (1978) had been ad-
ministered at intake and at 6, 12, and 24 months
postpartum. Pearlin and Schooler's definition of

24 RESEARCH IN NURSING & HEALTH
mastery was found to be consistent with Damon
and Hart's definition of self-agency. Pearlin and
Schooler define mastery as ``the extent to which
the individuals regard life-changes as being under
their own control, in contrast to being fatalistically
ruled'' (1978, p. 5). The Pearlin Mastery Scale
contains seven items; five of the items elicit beliefs
about self-control over current life circumstances
and the ability to solve problems through self-
effort. The other two items elicit beliefs about the
ability to influence future possibilities for self.
Participants were asked to select their level of item
endorsement from a 4-point continuum of re-
sponse options ranging from strongly disagree to
strongly agree. Scale scores were computed by
summing the item scores and dividing by the
number of items completed by each participant.
Scale scores ranged from 1 to 4. Pearlin reported
the original Cronbach's alpha for the Mastery
Scale as .72 (personal communication, October 4,
2002). The Cronbach's alpha for the Pearlin
Mastery Scale used in the Memphis study was .75.
Subsequent pregnancies. Maternal self-
reports were the basis for determining subsequent
pregnancies for mothers from the birth of the index
infant through that infant's second birthday. Every
pregnancy was counted, whether or not it resulted
in a live birth.
Maternal responsiveness. The Maternal Re-
sponsivity subscale of the Infant/Toddler version
of Caldwell and Bradley's Home Observation for
Measurement of the Environment (HOME, 1979)
was used to measure the verbal and emotional
responsiveness of mothers toward their infants.
Caldwell and Bradley reported a Kuder­Richard-
son internal consistency coefficient of .72 for the
Maternal Responsivity subscale of the HOME
(1984). Cronbach's alpha for this subscale in the
Memphis study was .64. Trained observers asses-
sed maternal responsiveness within the mothers'
home environments at infant ages 12 and 24 months.
An interrater reliability of 96% was achieved
before beginning observations.
Categorical variable coding at relevant
thresholds of effect. Categorical variables were
created to test the probability of enacting targeted
health behaviors by endorsement of self-agency.
Variables were split at expected thresholds of
effect. The goal was to identify a threshold that
would likely represent a substantial expression
of the construct and a noticeable difference in
behavior. To maintain the integrity of the re-
search design, variable thresholds were estab-
lished a priori and external to the data through
systematic examination of scale items and possi-
ble response patterns. Establishing thresholds, or
cut points, of clinical significance has been applied
in other areas of social science research and can be
useful in evaluating behavior at levels of function-
ing pertinent to everyday life (Kazdin, 1999).
Establishing a threshold for measurement of
self-agency was believed to be consistent with the
tenets of developmental theory. Levels of con-
ceptual understanding are expected to become
more complex as individuals develop. Individuals
are not expected to return to earlier, less diffe-
rentiated levels of self-understanding after more
complex representations of self have emerged.
Yet some fluctuation in self-agency scores from
measurement to measurement can be anticipated
because of variations in mood and stress or be-
cause of artifacts of the events immediately pre-
ceding the measurement situation. By imposing
threshold and sustainability rules, the magnitude
of each individual's self-agency endorsement and
anyfluctuations in scores over timewere evaluated
in relationship to an overall pattern of evidence
that a level of self-understanding consistent with
self-agency had been achieved.
The threshold score for self-agency was estab-
lished through examination of individual items on
the Pearlin Mastery Scale and analysis of possible
response patterns that might yield a scale score of
1­4 (see above for a description of scale score
computation). This process resulted in establish-
ing a threshold scale score of 3 out of a possible 4.
We reviewed response patterns that could con-
tribute to a scale score of 3 and concurred that
patterns yielding a score of 3 or higher would
likely represent a substantial expression of self-
agency. To overcome the potential error of in-
terpreting maternal self-agency from an isolated
score at a single measurement point, sustainability
rules were applied that required maternal self-
agency scale scores to be maintained at 2.75 or
higher through subsequent measurement periods
once the established threshold score of 3 had been
achieved. For example, a mother might exaggerate
her endorsement of self-agency at intake, receiv-
ing an intake scale score of 3, but score a much
lower 1.5 on the Pearlin Mastery Scale at a subse-
quent measurement period (at 6, 12, or 24 months
postpartum). Because the threshold established
for self-agency was not maintained through sub-
sequent measurements, this mother would not be
identified as achieving and sustaining the thresh-
old for self-agency.
A threshold score for maternal responsiveness
was derived in a similar manner, through systema-
tic examination of the 11 items on the Maternal
Responsivity subscale of the Caldwell and Brad-
ley HOME (1979). A clinically relevant threshold
RELATION BETWEEN SELF-AGENCY AND HEALTH BEHAVIORS/DESOCIO ET AL. 25
score for responsive maternal behavior was set
at 9 out of a total possible subscale score of 11.
Sustainability rules were again applied, requiring
that a threshold score of 9, achieved at 12 months,
be sustained with a subscale score of 8 or higher at
24 months. If the threshold score was not achieved
until 24 months, a subscale score of 8 or higher on
the Maternal Responsivity subscale was required
for the previous 12-month HOME observation.
Categorization by subsequent pregnancies was
established through counting each mother's sub-
sequent pregnancies from the birth of the index
infant through that infant's second birthday. The
threshold score was set at 0. Mothers were assign-
ed to either the ``no subsequent pregnancies'' or
``oneormoresubsequentpregnancies''categories.
Data Analysis
Categorical variables were submitted to proba-
bility analyses using the Fisher exact test of
probabilities, with alpha established at .05. The
statistical model was set up as a 2 Â 2 table, ex-
amining the likelihood of enacting each targeted
health behavior by mothers' self-agency endorse-
ment at intake (threshold met and sustained or
threshold not met). The Fisher exact test deter-
mines the significance of probabilities by testing
observed cell frequencies against the possibility
of extreme marginal frequencies. This is a useful
procedure when any cell in a 2 Â 2 table contains
a value of 5 or less. Geometric formulations for the
Fisher exact test of probabilities correct for the
possibility that extreme values may be distributed
to one or more of the mutually exclusive cells or
categories (Roscoe, 1975; Siegel, 1956).
RESULTS
Descriptive Data
Applying the established threshold and sus-
tainability rules for self-agency, 76 (41%) of the
186 mothers in this analysis met the criteria for
achievement of the self-agency threshold on
intake, whereas 110 (59%) did not. The mean in-
take self-agency score for the 76 mothers who met/
sustained the self-agency threshold was 3.43
(SD ¼ .34). The mean intake self-agency score
for the 110 mothers who did not meet/sustain
self-agency threshold was 2.74 (SD ¼ .37). By
24 months postpartum the mean self-agency score
for the 76 mothers who met/sustained the self-
agency threshold from intake was 3.49 (SD ¼ .37),
and the mean 24-month self-agency score for the
110 mothers who did not meet/sustain the self-
agency threshold from intake was 3.05 (SD ¼ .49).
Although group parameters, such as the mean
and the standard deviation, are of interest in com-
paring differences between subgroups of mothers
in this analysis, group statistics were not applied
in the determination of threshold achievement.
Each mother's pattern of self-agency scores was
examined independently to determine if/when she
met and sustained the established threshold. It
should be reiterated that, by definition, achieving
self-agencythreshold onthePearlinMasteryScale
at intake carried the requirement of sustaining
a substantial level of self-agency endorsement
through the 24-month postpartum measurement.
By the completion of the nurse visitation in-
tervention and the infants' second birthdays, 69
(37%) of the 186 mothers had experienced at
least one subsequent pregnancy. The remaining
117 mothers (63%) delayed subsequent pregnan-
cies for at least the 2-year period following the
birth of their infants.
Dataoneitherthe 12-month or24-monthHOME
was not available for 5 of the 186 mothers in
the group; therefore they could not be evaluated by
the established threshold and sustainability rules
for maternal responsiveness. Threshold scores
for maternal responsiveness were achieved and
sustained by 104 (57%) of the 181 mothers by
the 24-month measurement. The remaining
77 mothers (43%) did not achieve and sustain
the established threshold for the outcome of
maternal responsiveness.
Analysis of Probabilities
Probabilities of enacting the targeted health be-
haviors were examined in relationship to partici-
pants' self-agency endorsement on entry into the
program. We anticipated that mothers who had
achieved the self-agency threshold at intake would
be more likely to utilize the nurse home-visitation
intervention to purposefully direct their behavior
toward desired program outcomes.
A probability analysis was conducted to ex-
amine the likelihood of mothers experiencing
subsequent pregnancies based on their self-agency
endorsement at intake. It was determined that
mothers who met and sustained the threshold for
self-agency from intake through subsequent
measurement periods were significantly less likely
to have experienced subsequent pregnancies by
their infants' second birthdays (Fisher exact,
p ¼ .014). The power to detect the observed dif-
ference was examined, assuming two-sided and

one-sided tests of significance, with alpha .05
(Hintze, 2000). Table 2 displays the results.
In a second analysis we examined the probabi-
lity of demonstrating responsive maternal beha-
vior based on mothers' self-agency endorsement
at intake. It was determined that mothers who met
and sustained the threshold for self-agency from
intake through subsequent measurement periods
were significantly more likely to meet and sustain
the threshold for responsive maternal behavior
(Fisher exact, p ¼ .047). The power to detect the
observed difference was examined, assuming two-
sided and one-sided tests of significance, with
alpha .05 (Hintze, 2000). Table 3 displays the
results.
DISCUSSION
To test the relationship between participant self-
agency and the enactment of health behaviors, this
secondary analysis was conducted with data from
socially disadvantaged mothers in the interven-
tion group of the Memphis New Mothers' Home
Visitation Study (Kitzman & Olds, 1990). Our
findings supported participant self-agency as a
characteristic associated with differential inter-
vention effectiveness in achieving the targeted
health behaviors of one nurse home-visitation
program. Further research on other study samples
is necessary to extend the implications of these
findings.
Findings from this study contribute to a body of
literature directed toward examination of maternal
characteristics that account for differential in-
tervention utilization and outcomes in programs
of nurse home-visitation research. Nurse home-
visitation programs apply broad population pa-
rameters when identifying individuals at risk for
adverse maternal and child outcomes (Olds &
Korfmacher, 1998). Participant recruitment casts a
wide net and typically gathers a heterogeneous
sample of individuals who meet population cri-
teria associated with a risk (e.g., criteria for social
disadvantage). Once in the study, individual char-
acteristics and levels of functioning may interact
with intervention processes in unforeseen ways
and contribute to unexplained variance in treat-
ment group effects. In this study we established
a rationale for examining the development of
self-agency as a theoretically derived character-
istic that might moderate participant readiness
to benefit from health-promoting interventions.
We found support for this premise in testing the

relationship between self-agency and enactment
of program outcomes in one program of nurse
visitation research. These findings are consistent
with those of other researchers who have linked
differential intervention utilization to maternal
age, which may be considered a broad marker for
developmental differences (Osofsky et al., 1988).
Findings related to self-agency may encourage the
pursuit of developmental explanations for other
variables associated with differential program out-
comes, including maternal social skills (Barnard
et al., 1988) and psychological resources (Olds &
Korfmacher, 1998).
The purpose of our study was to examine
whether self-agency makes a difference in enact-
ing change in health behaviors. The significant
findings from this analysis generate additional
research questions. For example, if participant
self-agency does matter in the probability of re-
alizing program outcomes, then questions about
how or if the development of self-agency can be
mobilized are of interest. In this analysis we
identified self-agency achievement as a partici-
pant characteristic at intake. Additional research
will be needed to examine the impact of the nurse
visitation intervention on the development of self-
agency.
Also of interest for future analysis is the re-
search question about self-agency development as
a mediator of intervention effects. For example,
does intervention mobilize self-agency devel-
opment among participants who do not endorse
self-agency at intake, thereby increasing their
likelihood of achieving program outcomes? Re-
search onself-agency as a mediator ofintervention
effects would require analysis of both the inter-
vention and control groups.
The limitations of this analysis merit discus-
sion. In conducting a secondary analysis of data,
we were limited to the measures used in the
primary study. Additional tools and/or items to
measure self-agency would strengthen the find-
ings of this study. We identified the Pearlin
Mastery Scale as an instrument that could re-
present the construct of self-agency as defined
by Damon and Hart (1991). Examination of the
Pearlin Mastery Scale items revealed two under-
lying dimensions consistent with the self-agency
construct: (a) beliefs in the ability to solve current
problems through self-effort and (b) beliefs in the
ability to shape future possibilities through self-
effort. The availability of the mothers' scores over
four measurement points allowed us to establish
rules for meeting and sustaining a threshold of
self-agency achievement. For this analysis thresh-
old and sustainability criteria were established
a priori and were based on the face validity of
items. Normative thresholds, derived from ana-
lyses of populations representing different ages,
have not been established for the Pearlin Mastery
Scale. Although findings from this study sup-
ported the usefulness of threshold methodology in
detecting the relationship between maternal self-
agency and enactment of program outcomes,
additional research with other study samples is
needed to test the merit of the threshold and
sustainability rules for this scale.
This analysis of self-agency and enactment of
health behaviors adds to the body of research on
maternal characteristics associated with diffe-
rential intervention utilization and effectiveness
in programs of nurse home-visitation research.
Our findings support the value of self-agency as
a construct of interest in research on behavior
change and suggest new areas for instrument
development and measurement methodologies.
These findings contribute to an awareness of indi-
vidual differences in self-agency as a potential
source of variance in treatment outcomes.
