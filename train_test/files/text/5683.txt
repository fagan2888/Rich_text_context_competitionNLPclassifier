Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the
leading contributors to cancer incidence and mor-
tality worldwide [Torre et al. 2015] and is particu-
larly prevalent in China, given the recent rise in
chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and cir-
rhosis [Cui and Jia, 2013]. Surgical resection is a
major treatment for patients with early- and mid-
dle-stage HCC that produces good results.
However, the majority of patients are medically
inoperable at the time of diagnosis, and few
meaningful therapeutic options are currently
available. Traditionally, radiotherapy (RT) was
infrequently used for treatment of HCC due to
early reports that the radiation tolerance of the
liver was far less than the therapeutic radiation
dose [Koo et al. 2010]. Since three-dimensional
conformal RT (3DCRT) was introduced for the
treatment of HCC, it has achieved encouraging
clinical outcomes [Sharma, 2014]. Due to its
increased benefits, RT has been recommended for
the treatment of all HCC tumours irrespective of

Abstract
Background: Peripheral blood lymphocytes play an important role in antitumour
immunity. We examined the relationship between the minimum absolute lymphocyte
counts (Min ALCs) during radiotherapy (RT) and clinical outcomes in patients with
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Methods: Data from a total of 69 HCC patients who had received RT were retrospectively
analysed. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were measured before RT, weekly during RT and
after RT. Regression and mixed-effect models were used to assess the relationships with and
potential predictors of overall survival (OS). Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve
analysis was used to define optimal cut-off points of continuous variables for outcomes.
Results: The median follow up was 30 months (range, 4­68 months). The median survival time
(MST), 1-year OS rate and 2-year OS rate of the whole group were 25 months, 51% and 39%,
respectively. The average circulating lymphocyte counts declined during RT (1493.19 versus
503.48 cells/µl, p < 0.001). A lower Min ALC was associated with worse OS (p = 0.001), with
a cut-off value of 450 cells/µl (sensitivity and specificity, 50% and 70.6%, respectively). The
MSTs, 1-year OS rates and 2-year OS rates were 15 months versus 47 months, 27% versus
78% and 4% versus 71% for patients with relatively lower (450 cells/µl) and higher Min ALCs
(>450 cells/µl), respectively (p < 0.001). After adjusting for potential confounders, multivariate
Cox regression analysis demonstrated that Min ALC independently predicted patients' OS (HR,
0.32; 95% CI, 0.15­0.69).
Conclusions: Lower Min ALCs during RT may act as a worse prognostic factor for HCC after RT.

Lymphocytes, which belong to a population of
radiation sensitive cells, account for approxi-
mately 30% of the normal human white blood
cell population and play an important role in anti-
tumour immunity [Topalian et al. 2011]. In a
study by Nagai and colleagues, peritransplant
lymphopenia was found to predict HCC recur-
rence after liver transplantation [Nagai et al.
2014]. A low absolute lymphocyte count (ALC)
was also used as an indicator of malnutrition and
poor immune response in patients with chronic
liver disease [Fernandez-Ruiz et al. 2009]. In
addition, increasing evidence has shown that
radiation-related lymphopenia is correlated with
tumour progression and prognosis in several types
of advanced cancers [Kitayama et al. 2011; Cho
et al. 2016a, 2016b]. From these studies, we can
hypothesize that peripheral ALCs will decline
during RT, and the degree of decline may exhibit
some clinical significance. However, the relation-
ship between the minimum absolute lymphocyte
count (Min ALC) during RT and clinical out-
comes in patients with HCC has not been charac-
terized. Therefore, the aim of this retrospective
analysis was to validate our hypotheses and to
investigate the clinical significance of Min ALCs
during RT in HCC patients.
Methods
Study populations
The study was conducted with the approval of the
Shandong Tumour Prevention and Control
Institutional Ethics Committee, Shandong Cancer
Hospital affiliated to Shandong University. Written
informed consent was obtained from the patients
or their legal representatives. Data from patients
who were diagnosed with HCC based on pathology
results or who were diagnosed via the diagnostic
criteria of the American Association of the Study of
Liver Guideline [Fitzmorris et al. 2015] at
Shandong Cancer Hospital affiliated to Shandong
University between January 2009 and January 2015
were retrospectively analysed. The clinical data
were obtained from medical records. All patients
satisfied the following inclusion criteria: (i) 18
years of age; (ii) Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status of 0­1 [Gil-Alzugaray
et al. 2013]; (iii) received RT with a conventional
fraction at our institution; (iv) available baseline
clinical, laboratory and follow-up data; (v) the
peripheral white blood cell counts were all above
2000 cells/µl during RT treatment and didn't
receive any prophylactic or remedial treatment; and
(vi) a survival time after RT of at least 3 months.
Patients were excluded if they had a history of other
malignancies, failed to complete RT, had evidence
of distant metastasis, had received surgical treat-
ment for HCC, had splenomegaly, a fever or an
elevation of C-reactive protein during RT or had an
HBV reactivation during RT that was attributed to
HBV infection. A total of 69 patients with HCC
were finally included and evaluated. All patients
had undergone a standardized evaluation, includ-
ing abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan-
ning, chest X-ray or CT, brain magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and bone radionuclide imaging,
and the disease stage was identified according to
the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system.
RT was delivered via sliding window 3DCRT or
intensity-modulated radiation therapy. A total dose
of 39.60­63.48 Gy (Gray) was administered at
1.8­2.0 Gy per fraction for 5 days a week. The
gross tumour volume was delineated by CT accord-
ing to the primary lesion or the lipiodol deposit
from transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and
the positive enlargement of retroperitoneal lymph
nodes. All plans were completed using the Varian
Eclipse version 8.6.23 treatment planning system.
Additionally, treatment plans including RT dose,
number of fractions and the start and the end date
of RT were recorded for each patient.
Assessment of absolute lymphocyte counts
Detailed clinical and laboratory data that were
obtained prior to the initiation of RT were col-
lected from enrolled patients and included demo-
graphic data, tumour status, haematologic
parameters, biochemical parameters and serum
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. Blood samples
were obtained by venous puncture and were col-
lected 0­3 days before the start of RT for the
quantification of lymphocytes, as well as once a
week during RT and after RT. Changes in lym-
phocyte counts during RT were evaluated.
Additionally, the Min ALCs and the days when
Min ALCs were measured were analysed.
Follow up and definition
Patients underwent a standardized follow up after
RT until the end of December 2015, their last visit
to our hospital or death; the follow-up evaluations
Q Zhao, X Xu et al.
http://tag.sagepub.com 233
included physical examinations, peripheral blood
cell counts, liver function tests, serum AFP meas-
urements, HBV-deoxyribonucleic acid test results
(HBV-DNA test), X-rays every 3 months for the
first year and every 6 months thereafter and abdom-
inal and pelvic CT or MRI every 6 months.
RT-related toxicity was documented during and
after RT and was evaluated according to radiation
therapy oncology group criteria. Radiation-induced
liver disease (RILD) was defined as either an anict-
eric elevation of alkaline phosphatase levels of at
least twofold and nonmalignant ascites (classic
RILD) [Lawrence et al. 1995] or elevated transami-
nases of at least fivefold of the upper limit of normal
or of pretreatment levels (grade 3 or 4 hepatic tox-
icity of the Common Toxicity Criteria Version 2.0
by the National Cancer Institute), in the absence of
documented progressive disease (nonclassic RILD)
[Trotti et al. 2000]. Patients who experienced dis-
ease progression or recurrence were treated appro-
priately with TACE, chemotherapy, or sorafenib.
Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the time
of the initiation date of RT to the date of death
regardless of cause or the censored date of the last
contact for surviving patients.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS sta-
tistical software (version 17, SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA). Quantitative variables are presented as
medians and ranges and compared using the
Mann­Whitney U test (nonparametric).
Qualitative variables are presented as frequencies
and analysed using the Pearson chi-square test.
Cut-off values for laboratory data demonstrated
the maximum sensitivity and specificity for sur-
vival based on the receiver-operating characteris-
tic (ROC) curve [Budczies et al. 2012]. The
primary endpoint of this study was OS. Actuarial
survival was obtained using the Kaplan­Meier
method and was compared with the results of the
log-rank test. We conducted univariate and mul-
tivariate analyses using the Kaplan­Meier method
and the Cox proportional hazards model to assess
factors related to patients' survival. Potential risk
factors with a p value of <0.1 in the univariate
analysis were entered into a multivariate analysis
to determine their independent effect. The sam-
ple size for the current study was not based on
predetermined power calculations. The sample
size from our analyses (n = 69) had 96% power to
detect a hazard ratio (HR) for the effects of Min
ALC on OS. A value of p < 0.05 in the two-tailed
analysis was considered to indicate a statistically
significant difference.
Results
Baseline characteristics of patients and clinical
outcomes
Between January 2009 and December 2014, 154
patients were diagnosed with HCC and received
RT at the Shandong Cancer Hospital affiliated to
Shandong University. A total of 69 patients met
the study criteria and were fully evaluated. The
baseline characteristics of these patients are
detailed in Table 1. The median follow-up period
was 30 months (range, 4.0­68 months) for all
patients and 37 months (range, 11­68 months) for
living patients. After radiation, six patients devel-
oped RT-related complications and they all recov-
ered after effective symptomatic treatment. As for
postradiotherapy treatment, 65 patients received
TACE (number of times were 2­5), two patients
received chemotherapy and two patients received
sorafenib as a result of distant metastasis.
ROC curve analysis was performed to determine
the threshold Min ALC for the prediction of OS
[Budczies et al. 2012]. The most predictive Min
ALC was determined to be 450 cells/µl (sensitiv-
ity and specificity, 50% and 70.6%, respectively),
and the area under the curve of the Min ALC was
0.56. To evaluate the prognostic role of Min
ALCs, we divided the whole group into a lower
Min ALC (450 cells/µl) (n = 37) and a higher
Min ALC (>450 cells/µl) group (n = 32). The
characteristics of patients with respect to the cut-
off Min ALC of 450 cells/µl are shown in Table 2.
No significant differences were observed between
the two groups for most baseline characteristics,
except for the BCLC stage. The results indicated
that the BCLC stage was positively associated
with lower Min ALCs during RT in patients with
advanced BCLC scores (p = 0.008).
Absolute lymphocyte counts during radiation
We examined the peripheral lymphocyte counts
during RT. This is a retrospective study, and the
timing and frequency of blood tests were therefore
different in each patient. We analysed the medical
data of all patients according to the number of
days from the initiation of RT. As expected, the
average circulating lymphocyte counts declined
after RT (1493.19 versus 503.48 cells/µl, p <

0.001) (Figure 1a). The Min ALCs during RT
and on the days when Min ALCs were measured
are plotted in Figure 1(b). According to this graph,
it is clear that most of the Min ALCs appeared
between 20 and 50 days after the initiation of RT.
Associations between patient characteristics
and survival
At the end of the follow-up period, 22 (31.9%)
patients were still alive. The median survival time
(MST), 1-year OS rate and 2-year OS rate in the
whole group were 25 months, 51%, and 39%,
respectively. The MSTs of different subgroups and
the results of univariate and multivariate analyses
are detailed in Table 3. Survival was worse in
patients with relatively lower Min ALCs (450
cells/µl) than in those with higher Min ALCs (>450
cells/µl); the MSTs, 1-year OS rates and 2-year OS
rates were 15 months versus 47 months, 27% versus
78% and 4% versus 71%, respectively, (p < 0.001)
in the lower and higher Min ALC groups. No cor-
relation of survival with age, gender, Karnofsky
performance status (KPS), prognostic nutritional
index (PNI), -glutamyl transferase (GGT), radia-
tion dose or postradiotherapy treatment was found.

The OS of patients with BCLC stage C, lower
serum ALCs, higher serum neutrophil­lymphocyte
ratio (NLR) and AFP levels before RT or lower
serum Min ALCs during RT was significantly
worse than that of patients with a BCLC stage of
A/B, higher serum ALCs, lower serum NLR and
AFP levels or higher serum Min ALCs (p values
were <0.001, 0.018, 0.001, <0.001 and <0.001,
respectively; see Figure 2).
A Cox regression model was used to further
assess the independent prognostic ability of the
above risk factors. After adjusting for potential
confounders, multivariate Cox regression analy-
sis demonstrated that Min ALC independently
predicted patients' OS [hazard ratio (HR), 0.32;
95% confidence interval (CI), 0.15­0.69] (see
Table 3). However, the prognostic significance
of the ALC and NLR before RT disappeared in
the multivariate regression (p = 0.173 and p =
0.064, respectively).
Taking into account the effects of the tumour
staging on OS, staging was stratified to further
clarify the prognostic significance of Min ALCs
(Figure 3). We did not perform a comparison for
the BCLC A group because only six patients were
included in that group. For patients with BCLC
B staging, subjects with higher Min ALCs exhib-
ited longer OS than subjects in the lower Min
ALC group (p = 0.003; Figure 3a) and patients
with BCLC B staging (p = 0.047; Figure 3b).

Discussion
A decline in the ALC after treatment has been
identified as a prognostic biomarker for several
malignancies. Saroha and colleagues suggested
that a low ALC is associated with aggressive fea-
tures and inferior survival in patients with clear
cell renal cell carcinoma [Saroha et al. 2013].
Balmanoukian and colleagues reported that lym-
phopenia was an independent predictor
for survival in patients with resected pancreatic
adenocarcinoma [Balmanoukian et al. 2012]. A
decline in peripheral lymphocyte counts after RT
was first described in the 1970s [Stratton et al.
1975], but the clinical significance has not been
well studied. This retrospective analysis of HCC
patients who received RT demonstrated that lym-
phocyte counts declined after RT, and this obser-
vation has also been found in other cancer types

[Santin et al. 2000; Pinkawa et al. 2014]. In our
study, a multivariate analysis revealed that Min
ALCs were a predictor of OS that was independ-
ent of the BCLC score and the serum AFP level.
Patients who developed lower lymphopenia (Min
ALCs  450 cells/µl) after RT had worse OS than
those who exhibited relatively higher Min ALCs
(>450 cells/µl) (p = 0.002; HR = 0.31; 95% CI,
0.15­0.64). This result suggests that a decrease in
peripheral lymphocyte counts would result in a
poor prognosis for HCC patients. The mecha-
nisms behind this finding are multifactorial and are
not yet completely understood. Some theories may
explain this association. First, some studies have
suggested that lymphopenia during RT might be
caused by the apoptosis of lymphocytes that are
caught in the radiation field [Yovino and
Grossman, 2012]. Second, the correlation
between the increasing infiltration of CD4+
T lymphocytes at tumour margins and a better
prognosis of HCC patients has been demonstrated
[Ma et al. 2016]. Third, in vivo studies have shown
that tumour cells that are dead or dying due to RT
with or without chemotherapy can present as
tumour-associated antigens to host immune cells
and thereby activate antitumour immune responses
[Apetoh et al. 2007]. Some clinical data have
revealed the presence of radiation-induced antitu-
mour immunity in humans [Schaue et al. 2008].
Lymphocytes exert an antitumour effect in the
tumour microenvironment and affect cancer devel-
opment and progression [Fu et al. 2013]. HCC
patients with severe lymphopenia have worse
immune system function and antitumour immu-
nity. This association has also been verified in
other types of cancer [Cho et al. 2016a, 2016b].
Consequently, a lower serum Min ALC during
RT, as a reflection of the host immunity network,
may be used to predict the result of cancer treat-
ment. However, we cannot ignore the effect of
various factors such as host nutrition and chronic
infection on the peripheral lymphocyte counts.
HBV activation and other infections were not
detected in any patients in our study during the
course of RT; therefore, we could state that this
value reflects the overall condition of the host to
fight the tumour. The Min ALC may be a good
marker of the host immune reaction to the tumour.
In the present study, we found that the ALC and
NLR before RT were correlated with OS accord-
ing to the univariate analysis, similar to the results
of previous studies [Templeton et al. 2014]. In
fact, accumulated evidence has suggested that a
higher NLR is an independent prognostic factor
in various solid tumours, including HCC [Kishi
et al. 2009; Ubukata et al. 2010; Huang et al.
2011]. In addition, some studies have shown that
a high NLR may suggest an impaired host
immune response of HCC patients to the tumour
[Zhong et al. 2006]. Taken together, these results
indicated that an elevated NLR can indirectly
reflect OS. Our results showed that patients with
an NLR  3 exhibited significantly better OS
than those with an NLR > 3 (p = 0.001).
However, the association between a high NLR
and poor survival is likely complex and largely
unclear. The increased number of neutrophils
and the decreased number of lymphocytes could
result in a high NLR. Patients with lymphocyto-
paenia have a weaker lymphocyte-mediated
immune response to the tumour as noted above.
As for patients with neutrophilia, Grivennikov
and colleagues suggested that systemic and local

inflammatory responses to the tumour may play a
role in tumour invasion [Grivennikov et al. 2010].
In addition, neutrophils have been shown to be
involved in angiogenesis, which affects tumour
development and is associated with a poor prog-
nosis in HCC patients [Zhong et al. 2006]. Taken
together, these findings indicate that an elevated
NLR can indirectly reflect the tumour burden,
invasion and OS. Therefore, in-depth research
into the mechanism of such an effect is warranted.
A lower ALC and an elevated NLR before RT
were correlated with a poor prognosis, but were
not found to be independent predictors of OS
according to the multivariate analysis in our
study, while a lower serum Min ALC (450 cells/
µl) during RT was an independent predictor of
OS. Therefore, a lower serum Min ALC during
RT may be a more suitable and reliable long-term
prognostic predictor for HCC patients.
The effect of the RT dose on the probability of
tumour control and survival is well established
[Ben-Josef et al. 2005]. Dawson and colleagues
found that patients who were treated with >70
Gy had an improved MST compared with those
who received <70 Gy (16.4 months versus 11.6
months, p = 0.0003) [Dawson et al. 2000]. In our
study, no correlation between RT dose and OS
was found. The radiation doses were all 39.60­
63.48 Gy, and no patient received a radiation
dose that was >70 Gy. Therefore, the RT dose
that patients received in our study was far less
than the lethal dose that obtained the maximum
antitumour effect in HCC patients. The main
barrier to dose escalation is the presence of adja-
cent critical structures, especially a normal liver
parenchyma. The issue of how to maximize thera-
peutic effects by escalating the radiation dose
while simultaneously sparing the adjacent normal
liver is a major subject of ongoing investigations.
Considering that RT-related lymphopenia
appears to be common, severe and closely associ-
ated with a poor prognosis in HCC patients, pro-
spective studies are needed to further discover
and test treatment approaches that preserve or
restore immunologic function. With regard to
checkpoint inhibitors, such as antiprogrammed-
death 1, programmed-death ligand 1 and cyto-
toxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 therapies, clinical
trials have suggested that treatment with these
agents could restore immunologic function
[Hiniker, 2012] and that the levels of peripheral
lymphocytes are predictive of efficacy [Ménard
et al. 2008]. The results could steer future treat-
ment approaches towards a reduction in the tox-
icities of RT in lymphocytes and produce a
definition of the proper timing and use of immu-
nologic interventions.
Some major limitations of this study should be
addressed. First, the survival analysis was limited
by the retrospective analysis and small number of
patients. The data were collected over a long
period, from a single centre, and most patients
had HBV-related diseases. Second, no data
showed that lymphocyte subsets (i.e. B, helper T
and cytotoxic T cells) or the alterations of differ-
ent subsets during or after RT could predict sur-
vival. Third, some patients received additional
treatments such as TACE or sorafenib after the
completion of RT. We believe that these treat-
ments may also effect the outcomes. Clearly,
these results warrant a largescale meta-analysis or
prospective studies to validate our findings.
The results of this retrospective analysis demon-
strated that in addition to BCLC stage and serum
AFP levels before RT, Min ALCs during RT
have an independent predictive value for OS. The
Min ALC during RT, which is an immunity-
based prognostic marker, may act as a prognostic
factor for HCC patients who are undergoing RT.
In addition, peripheral lymphocyte counts are
simple to measure in clinical practice and are rou-
tinely assessed in patients during treatment.
Therefore, examination of the dynamic changes
in lymphocyte counts may be helpful in the design
of individualized treatments for HCC patients.
