RESEARCH
The global crime drop and changes
in the distribution of victimisation
Ken Pease1* and Dainis Ignatans2
Abstract
Over three decades crime counts in England and Wales, as throughout the Western world, have fallen. Less attention
has been paid to the distribution of crime across households, though this is crucial in determining optimal distribu-
tion of limited policing resources in pursuing the aim of distributive justice. The writers have previously demonstrated
that in England and Wales the distribution of crime victimisation has remained pretty much unchanged over the
period of the crime drop. The present paper seeks to extend the study of changes in the distribution of victimisa-
tion over time using data from 25 countries contributing data to the International Crime Victimisation Survey (ICVS)
sweeps (1989­2000). While fragmentary, the data mirror the trends discerned in England and Wales. The trends are
not an artefact of the inclusion of particular countries in particular sweeps. The demographic, economical, geographi-
cal and social household characteristics associated with victimisation are consistent across time. The suggested policy
implication is the need for greater emphasis on preventing multiple victimisation.

Background
Distributions are as important as measures of central
tendency for applicable research. In the burgeoning liter-
ature on the near ubiquitous crime drop of recent years,
an emphasis on distributions has arguably been lacking.
Yet if (for example) the crime drop has been most marked
for those who already suffered relatively little crime (as
with regressive taxation) one would be concerned about
the disproportionate burden which the most victimised
continue to suffer. At the operational policing level, it is
crucial to know how the diminished crime burden is dis-
tributed, so as to inform resourcing and deployment deci-
sions. A recent paper (Ignatans and Pease 2015a) showed
that the crime drop in England and Wales in recent years
was greatest in absolute terms for the most victimised
households, but not so great relative to the decline of
crime generally as to yield a more even distribution of
victimisation. The most victimised came to suffer fewer
crimes, but these crimes represented a somewhat higher
proportion of the total burden than before. Disaggrega-
tion by offence type (Ignatans and Pease 2015b) showed
that the trends were for all practical purposes uniform
across crime types.
The crime drop is common across nations. Are the
distributional trends also similar cross-nationally? Early
analyses of the crime drop were flawed in their exclu-
sive concentration on trends in the USA. This led to
the choice as explanatory variables which were specific
to that country, such as prison use, police strength and
abortion legislation. These variables trended differently
in other countries with similar crime drops (Tonry 2014).
The intention here, insofar as the data permit, is to
examine whether the trends identified in England and
Wales extend beyond its borders. Is the slight increase in
inequality of distribution of crime evident in England and
Wales also evident elsewhere? The implications for crime
control are substantial and will be touched upon in the
"Conclusions".

were utilised. ICVS features victimisation reports over a
recall period of 1 year that were gathered from 25 coun-
tries contributing data in at least one sweep. Thirteen of
these countries featured in at least two sweeps. The data
used in the analyses comes from countries that were sur-
veyed nationally. Roughly 1000­2000 households were
interviewed from each country over the phone (Nether-
lands Institute for Scientific Information Services 1999).
Self-evidently trends require a minimum of two data
points to discern so data from twelve countries had to
be discarded. The fragmentary nature of the other data,
and the fact that the most recent ICVS sweep was in 2000
when the crime drop had been under way for less than a
decade, represented challenges. Given the unique nature
of the ICVS data and the importance of the topic in the
writers' view, it was a challenge worth accepting.
By taking into account the four-year time elapsing
between sweeps, national data present in two or more
datasets was deemed sufficient for substantive compari-
sons of trends in victimisation concentration over time.
Offences were coded identically in all the sweeps, per-
mitting consistent comparison across time. All thirteen
countries are used in the global analyses (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6).
Multiple events against the same victim in ICVS are
capped to a maximum of five for each offence type. If, for
example, someone reports having been assaulted twenty
times, the number of assaults is recorded as five. This
convention compromises accuracy. The writers' analy-
ses utilising the Crime survey for England and Wales
(CSEW) with unlimited incident reporting show many
victimisation repeats above the cut-off point of five. The
underrepresentation of chronic victims in crime surveys
is controversial (Farrell and Pease 2007; Lauritsen et al.
2012). The pre-imposed ICVS five-count threshold was
by necessity retained. The reader should be aware that by
doing so the extent of chronic victimisation, and hence
the inequality of victimisation, is understated.
When considering measurement of victimisation ine-
quality, a slightly amended approach from that of Lorenz
(1905) was adopted. Households were ranked by number
of victimisations suffered, the ranked households divided
into percentiles, and number of victimisations per per-
centile for each year calculated. Each percentile's crime
could then be expressed as a proportion of the year's total

victimisations. This permits detailed comparison of ICVS
sweeps and countries.
As noted earlier, Ignatans and Pease (2015b) showed
the basic patterns in England and Wales to be similar
across crime types. The same approach was applied to
ICVS where means and proportions of victimisations by
percentile for each crime type.
The figures below thus represent two variables.
·
· Mean number of victimisations of a particular crime
type suffered by the most victimised percentile, next
most victimised, and so on.
·
· The proportion of all victimisations of that type suf-
fered by the most victimised percentile, next most
victimised, and so on.
Results
In all the figures the scales should be noted. They differ,
being chosen to provide the clearest representation of
the key part of the victimisation distribution. Offences
were categorised in the appropriate categories in a fash-
ion consistent with previous papers (Ignatans and Pease
2015a, 2015b) attributing all crimes that involve direct
contact with the victim to the personal crime category,
even where property was taken. Categories were con-
structed in the following fashion. Vehicle crimes: car
theft, theft from car, damage to vehicle, motor vehicle
theft, bicycle theft. Property crimes: burglary, attempted
burglary, theft from garage. Personal crimes: robbery,
personal theft, sexual offences, assault. Figure 1 depicts
mean vehicle crimes by year. 82 % of households suffered
no vehicle crime so the abscissa starts at the 81st per-
centile, It will be seen that the mean number of vehicle
crime victimisations peaks then falls. This pattern is most
marked for the most victimised 1 % of households sam-
pled where a drop of 16 % is noted between the years of
1992 and 2000.
Figure 2 depicts the proportion of all vehicle crimes
by percentile and ICVS sweep. A greater proportion of
vehicle crime is suffered by the most victimised 1­2 %
of households in 2000 than had been the case in the two
preceding sweeps, and marginally more than in 1989.
After an initial decline, the proportion of crimes in the
tenth decile and especially top percentiles increased.

An increase of 19 percent is seen in the last percentile
between the years 1992 and 2000.
Parallel analyses for property crime are depicted as
Figs. 3 and 4 and personal crimes as Figs. 5 and 6.
Property victimisations show the by now familiar
decline in crime count and increase in proportion suf-
fered by those most victimised. Property crime count fell
by 30 % in the last percentile while the proportion of vic-
timisations attributed to the same households increased
by 43 per cent between the years 1992 and 2000. The
1989 sample backs the trend both here and in the depic-
tion of crimes against the person shown in Figs. 5 and 6.
The decline in crime counts and changes in proportion
suffered by the most victimised is much less marked for
crimes against the person than for other crime types. As
evidenced by previous work (Tseloni et al. 2010, p 383)
the drop in violent crime lagged behind the drop in other
crime types and the last ICVS sweep came too early to
capture the drop fully. Crime count experienced by the
top percentile dropped by 5 per cent between the years
1996 and 2000 while the proportion of victimisations
increased by 13 percent in the same time period.
The alert reader will note that the data could be skewed
by countries with different characteristics participating
in earlier relative to later sweeps. This was checked by
looking at pairwise within country comparisons across
sweeps. For example, comparing the first and fourth
sweeps in respect of vehicle crime, how many countries
exhibited a decrease in mean crime for the top percentile,
and how many an increase? Likewise, how many coun-
tries exhibited an increase in proportion of crime for the
top percentile and how many a decrease? Details of these
analyses are available from the first author on request.
Suffice it here to say that the decreased count slightly
increased concentration pattern is common across coun-
tries and is not an artefact of which countries partici-
pated in which sweeps.
To recapitulate, the absolute victimisation of the most
victimised has decreased internationally, as the propor-
tion of victimisation suffered by the most victimised 1 %
of households has increased. After an initial decline in
the early 1990s, the proportion of crimes attributed to
the most victimised increased to just below a quarter for
vehicle crimes, nearly a half for property crimes and over
a third for personal offences.
The next step in the present paper addresses the ques-
tion of whether the attributes of the heavily victimised
households remain similar across time. There is already a
substantial literature on attributes associated with crime
victimisation (Tseloni et al. 2010; Kershaw and Tseloni
2005; Osborn and Tseloni 1998; Tseloni 2006), but these
tend to be analyses at single points in time. Our previous
papers examined a number of characteristics available in
British data. The only other empirical study of which we
are aware which concerns equity if distribution of crime
events during the crime drop was the study of domestic
burglary of James Hunter and Andromachi Tseloni (2016).
Here the question is whether the variables which distin-
guish the most victimised households and individuals in
1989 are the same as those which distinguish the most
victimised in 2000. The conclusion reached is that the risk
factors of 2000 are similar to the risk factors of 1989. Bear
in mind that the present analysis says nothing directly
about area effects, which will also inform prioritisation
of crime prevention effort (Tseloni 2006; Kershaw and
Tseloni 2005; Osborn and Tseloni 1998) (Table 1).
Probabilities matter little with the sample sizes avail-
able. The important point is the consistency of the
findings, as the characteristics associated with highly vic-
timised are consistent across the 12 years of data avail-
able from the ICVS. Households with less favourable
economic, geographic and demographic characteristics
are consistently experiencing an overwhelmingly greater
proportion of victimisation.
Conclusions
Considering the convergence of patterns found in previ-
ous analyses limited to England and Wales and the cur-
rent international investigation, it appears that with little
doubt the cross-national crime drop can be seen as the
product of a drop in the count alongside a change in the
distribution of crime across households. Around half of
all property victimisation is suffered by the 1 % of house-
holds which are most victimised, as is about one third of
personal victimisation. The greater proportion of prop-
erty relative to personal victimisation differs from the
British picture, and is suspected to be an artefact intro-
duced by the capping of crime events. If there are many
victims of multiple personal crimes, this reversal of effect
would be the result. Research which is urgently neces-
sary and has been absent from the victimisation survey
literature to date has been follow-up interviews with
those multiply victimised to confirm the veracity of their
accounts. For those accusing multiple victims of confabu-
lation, the question why this confabulation should have
declined over time in line with decreased crime counts.
The practical implication made in previous papers should
simply be reiterated here. The concentration of crime pre-
vention effort and resources should be directed at those
already victimised. This is even more the case now than
was the case before the onset of the crime drop. Repeat vic-
timisation is most likely to occur and (reoccur the most) in
households with less favourable economic, geographical and
demographic factors, therefore police attention and preven-
tion efforts must be directed towards such households expe-
riencing first victimisation (Tseloni and Pease 2014, 2015).
