AIM: To explore the relationship between smoking and dieting in a cross-sectional nationally representative sample of young
adolescents.
METHODS: Smoking was assessed by serum cotinine concentrations in 1132 adolescents aged 12 ­ 18 y enrolled in the NHANES
III study. Information on adolescents' weight loss attempts were obtained by questionnaire. Normal weight was defined as a
body mass index (BMI) less than the 85th percentile for age and gender. Overweight was defined as a BMI equal to or greater
than the 85th percentile for age and gender. Nutritional intake was assessed with a 24 h recall and food frequency questionnaire.
RESULTS: There was a two-fold increase in smoking among normal-weight adolescent girls who reported trying to lose weight
(23.7% vs 12.6%, P < 0.01). In contrast, prevalence of smoking was similar among overweight adolescent girls who tried to lose
weight compared to those who did not (15.8% vs 14.1%, P ¼ 0.76). Similar trends were observed in boys. However, overweight
boys who were trying to lose weight were less likely to smoke than overweight boys who were not trying to lose weight (9.8% vs
24.5%, P < 0.05). There were no differences in body weight, BMI, caloric intake or fat intake among smokers and non-smokers.
However, smokers reported eating less fruit and vegetables compared to non-smokers, and were over five times more likely to
drink alcohol compared to non-smokers (odds ratio: ! 1Â=month, 5.28 (3.82 ­ 7.28), ! 4Â=month, 5.29 (3.58 ­ 7.82).
CONCLUSION: Tobacco use is common among normal weight adolescents trying to lose weight. Tobacco use is also associated
with a cluster of other unhealthy dietary practices in adolescents.

Introduction
Although it has been suggested that adolescents may use
tobacco as a form of weight control, the prevalence of this
practice is unknown. Ryan and colleagues have reported that
adolescent Irish girls who report recent dieting are over twice
as likely to smoke as adolescents who do not report weight
loss attempts.1 In addition, data from Tomeo et al2 and
French et al3 also suggest that smoking among girls was
associated with almost a two-fold risk of dieting. In fact,
the Expert Committee on the Evaluation and Treatment of
Childhood Obesity recommends that smoking cessation
should be one of the cornerstones of treating overweight
children, along with improved parenting skills, reduced
caloric intake and increased activity levels.4
Previous studies on the relationship between smoking and
dieting have relied on self-reported smoking behavior in
adolescents. While self-reported smoking behavior is gener-
ally considered a reliable measure of actual smoking in
adolescents, biases may exist in the data depending on the
setting that the information was obtained.5,6 In addition,
previous studies have also not examined whether smoking
was more prevalent among either normal-weight or over-
weight adolescents who were trying to lose weight or
whether nutritional intake was actually different among
smokers and non-smokers.
To address the association of dieting and adolescent
smoking, data were analyzed from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey, cycle III (NHANES III), a
nationally representative sample of children and adults.
Comprehensive data including weight, height, weight loss
attempts, smoking habits, and serum cotinine levels allowed

for analysis of the relationship of smoking to weight loss
attempts in overweight and normal-weight adolescents. Data
from both 24 h dietary recall and a food frequency ques-
tionnaire also allowed for the analysis of the relationship
between smoking and nutritional intake among adolescents.
Methods
Sample
The National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey,
Cycle III (NHANES III) is the seventh in a series of large
national health examination surveys conducted in the
United States since the 1960s. The first phase of NHANES
III examined a nationally representative sample of children
and adults between 1988 and 1991.{ The sample included
1331 children aged 12 ­ 18. Weights and heights were avail-
able on over 99% of the children. Serum cotinine levels were
available on 1132 of the adolescents (85% of eligible cohort).
Anthropometrics
Body weight and height were measured according to pre-
viously described methods.7 Reference body mass index
(BMI) percentiles were derived from the first National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.8 This definition
is in accordance with recommendations of the Expert Com-
mittee on Clinical Guidelines for Overweight in Adoles-
cence9 and Expert Committee on Obesity Evaluation and
Treatment.4 Normal weight was defined as a BMI (kg=m2) less
than the 85th percentile for age and gender; we classified
adolescents with a BMI (kg=m2) greater than the 85th per-
centile for age and gender as overweight.11,12
Smoking, weight loss attempts and nutritional
assessment
Adolescents were asked about frequency of smoking and
number of cigarettes smoked per day. In addition, adoles-
cents were also asked whether they had tried to lose weight
within the last 12 months. Nutritional intake was assessed
using a food frequency questionnaire and 24 h diet recall.
The food frequency questionnaire included an assessment of
alcohol intake. Previous studies have demonstrated the
validity and reliability of reported adolescent alcohol
intake.10 ­ 12 Intake of fat and energy were calculated using
the USDA's Survey Nutrient Data Base (SNDB) based on the
24 h dietary recall, which the adolescents provided them-
selves. Interviews were conducted privately, by trained study
staff, and staff performance was monitored routinely.
Laboratory testing
Serum cotinine levels were measured using an isotope dilu-
tion, liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry
method. Cotinine, a long-lasting metabolite of nicotine
(t1=2
¼ 15 ­ 20 h), is considered the most specific and sensitive
biological marker of cigarette smoking.13 Serum cotinine cut-
off levels of 15 ng=ml were used to designate smokers and
non-smokers. Previous studies using the NHANES III data
have demonstrated a 96% concordance between self-
reported smoking status and serum cotinine levels above or
below 15 ng=ml.14
Statistics
For the purposes of this study, `adolescents' were defined as
12 ­ 18-y-old children and `smokers' were defined as those
adolescents with a serum cotinine level of 15 ng=ml or
higher. Since the NHANES III study oversampled black
people, Hispanic people, and younger adolescents, the data
were adjusted to account for unequal selection by using
sample weights provided by NHANES III. Differences in
proportions were assessed using chi-square. Odds ratios
were calculated using logistic regression. Multivariate logistic
regression analysis was utilized to assess the independent
effects of smoking on nutritional intake after adjusting for
age, gender and family income. In order to adjust for com-
plex sample design and clustering effects in the NHANES III
sample, statistical significance was assessed using the
balanced repeated replication method using the software
package WesVarPC (Westat Inc., Rockville, MD).
Results
Overall concordance between self-reported smoking status
and serum cotinine levels was 92.7% (Table 1). In particular,
96.5% of adolescents with cotinine levels below 15 ng=ml
were self-reported non-smokers while 69.6% of adolescents
with serum cotinine levels above 15 ng=ml were self-reported
smokers. As a result, sensitivity for self-report was 77% and
specificity was 95%. For both boys and girls, prevalence of
both self-reported smoking and elevated serum cotinine
levels were significantly more common in older adolescents
compared to younger adolescents (P < 0.001). There was no
difference in family income between smokers and non-
smokers (P ¼ 0.95).
Similar levels of smoking were present in normal-weight
and overweight girls (17.0% vs 15.2%, P ¼ 0.51). However,
{Serum cotinine levels were not measured in the second phase of NHANES III
(1992 ­ 1994).

normal-weight girls who reported trying to lose weight were
over twice as likely to smoke as normal-weight girls who did
not try to lose weight (23.7% vs 12.6%, P < 0.01; odds ratio:
2.16 (1.26 ­ 3.72)). In addition, normal-weight female smo-
kers who attempted to lose weight reported smoking almost
twice as many cigarettes per day as normal-weight female
smokers who did not try to lose weight (cigarettes=day:
14.1Æ 1.1 vs 8.6Æ 1.2, P < 0.001). In contrast, there was no
difference in smoking among overweight girls who tried to
lose weight and those who did not (15.8% vs 14.1%,
P ¼ 0.76).
Similar results were observed in boys. Prevalence of smok-
ing was similar in normal-weight and overweight boys
(22.2% vs 19.4%, P ¼ 0.44). There was a trend for normal-
weight boys attempting weight loss to smoke more often
than normal-weight boys who did not attempt to lose weight
(35.5% vs 21.6%, P ¼ 0.11; odds ratio 2.00 (0.86 ­ 4.61)).
However, among overweight boys, those who were trying
to lose weight were significantly less likely to smoke com-
pared to those who were not trying to lose weight (9.8% vs
24.5%, P < 0.05).
Too few smoking adolescents were enrolled to determine
whether racial differences existed in patterns of smoking and
attempted weight loss. In addition, too few younger adoles-
cents were smokers to determine whether smoking and
attempted weight loss was related to age.
After adjusting for age and gender, there were no differ-
ences in reported caloric intake (P ¼ 0.75) and total fat intake
(P ¼ 0.13) between adolescent smokers and non-smokers
(Table 2). After adjusting for age, there was also no difference
in BMI between smokers and non-smokers among either
normal weight boys (P ¼ 0.26), overweight boys (P ¼ 0.84),
normal-weight girls (P ¼ 0.36), or overweight girls (P ¼ 0.98).
However, smokers reported significantly lower fruit and
vegetable intake per day (Table 2). Adolescents who
smoked had substantially lower levels of serum vitamin C
and b-carotene compared to non-smokers (vitamin C,
35.9Æ 2.9 vs 47.4Æ 1.6, P < 0.001; b-carotene, 0.19Æ 0.01 vs
0.26Æ 0.01, P < 0.001). In addition, alcohol intake was sig-
nificantly higher among smokers in both the 24 h dietary
recall (P < 0.001) and the food frequency record (P < 0.001).
In fact, adolescent smokers were over five times more likely
to report alcohol consumption compared to adolescent
non-smokers (odds ratio: ! 1Â=month, 5.28 (3.82 ­ 7.28);
! 4Â=month, 5.29 (3.58 ­ 7.82)).
Discussion
This study demonstrates over a two-fold increase in smoking
among normal-weight adolescent girls who have tried to lose
weight in a large, cross-sectional national cohort. By using
objective measures of smoking status, this study has con-
firmed previous findings showing a similarly increased risk of
smoking among girls who report either excessive weight
concerns or frequent dieting.1 ­ 3 In contrast, there was no
increased risk of smoking among either overweight girls or
overweight boys trying to lose weight. In fact, overweight
boys who were trying to lose weight were significantly less
likely to smoke than those who were not trying to lose
weight. These results imply that normal-weight girls may
adopt more pathological methods of weight loss than over-
weight girls and boys.
Overall dietary intake was worse in adolescents who
smoked compared to those who did not. While there were
no detectable differences in reported caloric or fat intake
among adolescent smokers and non-smokers, smokers ate
significantly less fresh fruit and vegetables. Similar findings
have been previously reported by Coulson and colleagues.15
Studies in adults also report less healthy diets in smokers
compared to non-smokers. A meta-analysis of over 60 studies
in adults examining patterns of nutrient intake in smokers
revealed a slight increase in total calories and fat among
smokers as well as decreased intake of fiber, fruit and vege-
tables.16 Adolescent smokers were also more than five times
more likely to consume alcohol on a regular basis than
non-smokers. In addition, Crisp and colleagues have

demonstrated more than a seven-fold increase in alcohol
consumption among adolescents who smoke.17 Therefore,
this study confirms the clustering of adolescent smoking
with adverse health and dietary behaviors which has been
previously described.18,19
Previous studies have demonstrated that almost 40% of
adolescents believe that smoking can help control their
weight.20,21 Although the cross-sectional design of the
study precludes any definitive conclusions on the relation-
ship between smoking and weight loss, the finding of similar
BMI as well as caloric and fat intake in both smokers and
non-smokers argues against any major relationship between
smoking and appetite suppression. Although there is ample
evidence that smoking cessation in adults typically leads to
3 ­ 5 kg weight gain, there is no evidence that smoking
initiation leads to weight loss.22 Both the Coronary Artery
Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA) and the
Nurses Health Study demonstrate similar degrees of weight
gain over a 7 ­ 8 y period in those who initiated smoking and
those who never smoked.23,24 Unfortunately, the NHANES III
data does not include objective measures of physical activity
or energy expenditure which could be influenced by nicotine
or other cigarette byproducts.25
The causal mechanism for the association between smok-
ing and dieting among adolescents remains speculative.
While it is likely that many adolescents begin smoking in
order to lose weight, it is also possible that dieting leads to
increased rates of smoking and alcohol use. Krahn and
colleagues have hypothesized that the feelings of deprivation
associated with dieting may increase the desire for both
cigarettes and alcohol.26 In animal models, food deprivation
is one of the most powerful stimulants for increased self-
administration drugs, alcohol and nicotine.27 In young
women, Jones et al,28 Hatsukami et al29 and Beary et al30
have shown that the prevalence of daily alcohol use
increases dramatically after the onset of bulimia.
In this study, serum cotinine levels were used as an
objective measure of smoking. While previous studies have
generally confirmed the reliability of self-reported smoking,
many adolescent smokers underestimate the amount of
cigarettes they smoke or even deny smoking.6 Murray and
colleagues have demonstrated that adolescent disclosure of
cigarette smoking is also different when adolescents are
promised confidentiality but not anonymity compared to
when the adolescents are promised both confidentiality and
anonymity.6 In this study, the results were both confidential
and anonymous. Nevertheless, the sensitivity and specificity
of self-reported smoking among adolescents was 77% and
95%, respectively, which is comparable to results obtained by
other authors using similar methodology.31 ­ 33
In summary, the use of the NHANES III data and its
inclusion of serum cotinine levels provides the most objec-
tive measure of the relationship between smoking and
attempted weight loss in adolescence. Normal-weight ado-
lescent girls who are trying to lose weight are particularly
likely to smoke. In addition, these results also highlight the
clustering of high-risk health patterns among adolescents --
smoking, dieting, alcohol consumption, and poor fruit and
vegetable intake. Although many adolescents believe that
smoking will decrease their weight, this study demonstrates
similar BMI, caloric intake and fat intake among smokers.
