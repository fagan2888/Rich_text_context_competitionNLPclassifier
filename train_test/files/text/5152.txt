Introduction
The candlestick chart was first developed in Japan and then
became popular around the world after its introduction to the
West by Nison (1991). It is very common for investors to use
them in conjunction with other technical indicators. In fact,
according to a survey by Menkhoff (2010), fund managers
apply it in their shorter term forecasts. Candlestick charting is
unique in the sense that it concurrently plots daily open, high,
low, and close price movements (Morris, 2006). As such, it
reveals demand and supply changing balance (Caginalp &
Laurent, 1998) and also investor sentiment and psychology
(Marshall, Young, & Rose, 2006). Proponents of candlestick
believe that investors could use these chart patterns to predict
short-term price movements or future turning points.
Surprisingly, despite its long history and popularity, there
are not many academic studies on candlestick patterns. There
is still no agreement whether this approach is profitable.
Some studies find that it is useless (Horton, 2009; Marshall,
Young, & Cahan, 2008; Marshall, Young, & Rose, 2007) at
least in the U.S. and Japanese stock markets. However, other
studies find that applying certain candlestick patterns is
profitable at least for short-term trading (Goo, Chen, &
Chang, 2007; Lu & Shiu, 2012; Lu, Shiu, & Liu, 2012; Shiu
& Lu, 2011; Zhu, Atri, & Yegen, 2016), at least in the
Taiwanese and Chinese stock markets. Interestingly, Lu,
Chen, and Hsu (2015) even find significant positive returns
in the U.S. stock markets if investors follow the Caginalp­
Laurent (CL) exit strategies (Caginalp & Laurent, 1998) but
not the Marshall­Young­Rose (MYR) exit strategies
(Marshall et al., 2006). The MYR applies a prespecified date
to exit the market, whereas the CL sets an exit price equal to
an average holding period closing price.
This article tests the profitability of candlestick trading
strategies both without technical filtering and with technical
filtering by applying the skewness adjusted t test (Johnson,
1978) and the binomial test. The data cover daily open, high,

Profitability of Candlestick Charting
Patterns in the Stock Exchange of
Thailand

Abstract
This article investigates the profitability of candlestick patterns. The holding periods are 1, 3, 5, and 10 days. Two exit
strategies are studied. One is the Marshall­Young­Rose (MYR) exit strategy and the other is the Caginalp­Laurent (CL) exit
strategy. The MYR applies a prespecified date to exit the market. In contrast, the CL sets an exit price equal to an average
holding period closing price, assuming that investors liquidate their positions evenly within this period. The daily data include
open, high, low, and close prices of component stocks of the SET50 index (the 50 largest capitalization stocks in the Stock
Exchange of Thailand [SET]) for a 10-year period from July 3, 2006, to June 30, 2016. This study tests the predictive power
of bullish and bearish candlestick reversal patterns both without technical filtering and with technical filtering (Stochastics
[%D], Relative Strength Index [RSI], Money Flow Index [MFI]) by applying the skewness adjusted t test and the binomial
test. The statistical analysis finds little use of both bullish and bearish candlestick reversal patterns since the mean returns
of most patterns are not statistically different from zero. Even the ones with statistically significant returns do have high
risks in terms of standard deviations. The binomial test results also indicate that candlestick patterns cannot reliably predict
market directions. In addition, this article finds that filtering by %D, RSI, or MFI generally does not increase profitability nor
prediction accuracy of candlestick patterns.

low, and close prices of component stocks of the SET50
index for a 10-year period from July 3, 2006, to June 30,
2016. The study on an individual stock data set has an advan-
tage over a study on a stock index in a sense that each stock
is tradable unlike a nontradable stock index. Moreover, the
use of individual stock data avoids potential biases intro-
duced by nonsynchronous trading within an index.
As previous literature focuses on the mature markets of
the United States and Japan and the emerging markets of
only Taiwan and China, this article extends the literature to
include the Southeast Asian emerging market of Thailand.
Moreover, the article investigates further the impact of dif-
ferent exit strategies. This important issue has not been
investigated outside the U.S. market or after Lu et al. (2015).
In addition, the use of Thai stock data to test candlestick pat-
terns, which were developed using Japanese rice data and
formerly tested only in the U.S., Japanese, and Chinese stock
markets, is clearly an ex ante evaluation. This mitigates the
issue of data snooping (Marshall et al., 2006). In addition,
this study also tests profitability of filtered candlestick pat-
terns, which is the use of candlesticks in combination with
other technical indicators. The applied technical filters are
Stochastics (%D), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Money
Flow Index (MFI). Basically, the buy or sell signals must be
confirmed by other indicators before they are acted upon to
avoid false signals. This test has not been done in previous
studies which focus exclusively on candlestick patterns.
The empirical results reveal that most candlestick reversal
patterns do not generate statistically significant mean returns.
Moreover, even some patterns that do have significant mean
returns usually have very high risks in terms of standard
deviations. The binomial tests also confirm that most candle-
stick patterns, even the ones with significant mean returns,
cannot reliably predict market directions. In addition, this
article finds that filtering either by %D, RSI, or MFI gener-
ally does not increase profitability nor prediction accuracy of
candlestick patterns.
The organization of this article is as follows. The
"Introduction" section provides a brief summary. "Literature
Review" section discusses both theories and existing empiri-
cal evidences. "Candlestick Methodology" section provides
a background of candlestick methodology. "Method" section
discusses the statistical method. The "Data" section provides
a discussion about data. "Empirical Results" and "Filtered
Candlestick Patterns" sections provide empirical results
without technical filtering and with technical filtering,
respectively. Finally, the "Conclusion" section concludes
and suggets further studies.
Literature Review
Theory
The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that secu-
rity prices already reflect all available and relevant
information (Fama, 1970). As a result, technical analysis
including charting patterns, which use only historical
trading data, cannot generate positive abnormal returns.
Investors could make money from charting patterns only
if the market is inefficient.
However, later theories start to challenge the EMH.
Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) theoretically demonstrate that,
if the market is perfectly efficient, then there is no benefits in
obtaining and analyzing costly information. The question is
then how could security prices reflect information when no
one is willing to process it. Therefore, the market cannot be
perfectly efficient. More recently, behavioral models, such as
noisy rational expectations models (Brown & Jennings,
1989), feedback models (DeLong, Shleifer, & Summers,
1990), and herding models (Froot, Scharftstein, & Stein,
1992) challenge the EMH. These models argue that price
adjusts slowly to new information due to noise, feedback
mechanism, or herding behavior. In these models, it is pos-
sible for trading strategies based on past data to generate
positive abnormal returns. As such, charting patterns may
still be useful for profitable trading.
Empirical Studies
The earliest test of candlestick trading strategies is Caginalp
and Laurent (1998). They used daily prices of all S&P500
stocks over the 1992-1996 period to test the prediction accu-
racy of candlestick patterns. Their binomial tests, as approxi-
mated by the normal distribution, indicate statistical
significance and an almost 1% return over a 2-day horizon.
However, later work by Marshall et al. (2006) and Marshall
et al. (2007) found the opposite conclusion. Their results
could not find profits from the use of candlestick patterns
onDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stocks over the
1992-2002 period. Their method is an extension of the boot-
strapping methodology that accommodates open, high, low,
and close prices. They conclude that the candlestick patterns
have no forecasting power. Results are based on the assump-
tion that a trade is executed at a close price on the day after a
signal. Stocks are generally held for up to 10 days. Horton
(2009) confirms these results. His article finds little value in
the use of candlestick.
Unlike previous studies which focus on daily data,
Duvinage, Mazza, and Petitjean (2013) test 5-min intraday
data of 30 component stocks of the DJIA index. After a cor-
rection for the data snooping bias, no single candlestick rule
on the double-or-out market timing strategy outperforms the
buy-and-hold strategy after transaction costs.
Following Marshall et al. (2006), Marshall, Young, and
Cahan (2008) used a similar approach in analyzing the larg-
est 100 stocks listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Their
results show that candlestick charting could not generate
positive abnormal returns in the Japanese equity market dur-
ing 1975-2004. In fact, it is not even consistently profitable
before transaction costs.
Tharavanij et al. 3
Lu et al. (2015) are later able to reconcile the conflicting
results from Caginalp and Laurent (1998) and Marshall et al.
(2006) by investigating profitability of two different exit
strategies. The first one is the CL exit strategy (Caginalp &
Laurent, 1998) and the other one is the MYR exit strategy
(Marshall et al., 2006). The MYR applies a prespecified date
to exit the market. On the contrary, the CL sets an exit price
equal to an average holding period closing price, assuming
that investors liquidate their positions evenly within this
period. They apply candlestick trading strategies to the 30
component stocks of the DJIA index over the 1992-2012
period and find that candlestick patterns with the CL exit
strategy are profitable even after transaction costs and cor-
rections of data snooping bias. In sharp contrast, candlestick
patterns with the MYR exit strategy are not profitable. They
reason that positive abnormal returns of the CL exit strategy
is a result from a risk sharing mechanism when stocks are
liquidated over the holding periods. They also find that the
bullish patterns are more profitable than the bearish ones. In
addition, they note that a short holding period of 3 days is
more profitable than a long holding period of 10 days.
Outside of the U.S. and Japanese stock markets, research
on candlestick trading strategies are done only in the
Taiwanese and Chinese stock markets. Most of them find
positive results. Goo et al. (2007) analyze daily data of 25
component stocks in the Taiwan Top 50 Tracker Fund and
Taiwan Mid-Cap 100 Tracker Fund from 1997 to 2006. They
find a strong evidence that certain candlestick trading strate-
gies are profitable. In addition, they notice that different
candlestick patterns require different holding periods to be
profitable. Shiu and Lu (2011) investigates the profitability
of candlestick 2-day patterns. The data set includes daily
prices and volumes for 69 securities listed at the Taiwan
Stock Exchange between 1998 and 2007. They find that the
Harami signals generate significant positive abnormal
returns. In another study, Lu and Shiu (2012) use the Taiwan
50 Index component stocks from 2002 to 2009 to study the
profitability of candlestick patterns. They find that certain
bullish candlestick patterns consistently outperform others.
Moreover, they notice that buying signals are generally more
effective than selling signals. Unlike previous studies which
focus on 2- or 3-day candlestick patterns, Lu (2014) exam-
ines the profitability of 1-day patterns by using daily data of
the Taiwan stocks during the period of 1992 to 2009. He
finds significant evidence that, after transaction costs, some
1-day candlesticks with the correct trend are profitable.
Instead of using fixed holding periods, Lu et al. (2012)
apply a variable holding period where stocks are bought after
bullish patterns and then held until bearish patterns happen.
The sample includes stocks included in the Taiwan Top 50
Tracker Fund from 2002 to 2008. They find that certain bull-
ish reversal patterns (but not bearish ones) generate positive
abnormal returns even after transaction costs.
In a more recent work, Zhu et al. (2016) use the two
Chinese exchange's data (Shanghai and Shenzhen stock
exchanges) from 1999 to 2008 to examine the prediction
accuracy of candlestick reversal patterns. They find that for
stocks of low liquidity, bearish harami, and cross signals quite
accurately predict reversals, whereas for highly liquid or
small stocks, bullish harami, engulfing, and piercing patterns
perform well. Additional evidence is provided by Chen, Bao,
and Zhou (2016). They study the prediction accuracy of 2-day
bullish and bearish candlestick patterns in Chinese stock mar-
kets. They find that the bullish and bearish harami, and the
homing pigeon are most accurate, whereas bullish and bear-
ish engulfing are good short-term forecasts (less than 2 days).
Candlestick Methodology
Candlestick Charting
The Japanese candlestick methodology is credited to
Munehisa Homma, a Japanese merchant, who applied them
to the rice markets in 1750 (Marshall et al., 2007). A candle-
stick chart involves simultaneously plotting of open, high,
low, and close prices. The box of a candlestick chart is called
a "real body" and it measures a difference between the open
and close prices. If a close price is higher (lower) than an
open price, then the body is white (black). In other words, a
white (black) body means rising (falling) prices during a day.
If the close and open prices are the same, then the real body
would be just a horizontal line called a "doji." The vertical
lines above and below the candlestick's body are "shadows."
The above one is called the upper shadow, whereas the below
one is called the lower shadow. They represent the high and
low prices respectively within a specific time frame. See
Figure 1 for candlestick charts.
The candlestick charting is best suited to daily price series
(Nison, 1991). The rationale is that daily open and close
prices would also incorporate overnight information, rather
than only intraday information (Morris, 2006).
Trend Definitions
Morris (2006) argues that a candlestick pattern can generate
a valid trading signal only if a trend is identified. There are
three trend definitions in the literature.
The first type of trend is the MA3 (Moving Average over
3 days) introduced by Caginalp and Laurent (1998). An
uptrend happens when a 3-day simple moving average is
monotonically increasing for at least 5 of 6 successive days.
Similarly, a downtrend occurs when a 3-day simple moving
average is monotonically decreasing for at least five of six
successive days. Goo et al. (2007), Horton (2009), and Lu
(2014) apply this method.
The second type of trend is the EMA10 (Exponential
Moving Average over 10 days) suggested by Marshall et al.
(2006) and Marshall, Young, and Cahan (2008). When a
close price is higher (lower) than its EMA10, an upward
(downward) trend is identified. The key advantage of EMA10
4 SAGE Open
is that a market is always in either an uptrend or a downtrend.
The EMA is calculated by the following formula, whereas
"C" denotes a close price and N is the averaging period. In
this case, N is 10 trading days.

Zhu et al. (2016) apply an alternative version of this sec-
ond type of trend. In this version, the short-period (5 days)
moving average (MV5) and the long-period (10 days) mov-
ing average (MV10) are calculated. If MV5 is higher (lower)
than MV10, then an upward (downward) trend is detected.
The third type of trend is the Levy trend introduced in Levy
(1971). This is, in fact, the first proposed definition. A reversal
point of a trend can be detected by a percentage incremental
price move over 6 days (the slope). Then, the averages of clos-
ing price changes over the most recent 131 days (the average
change) are calculated. An uptrend is defined as the periods
when the slope is higher than 6-time the average change. The
identification of a downtrend is just the opposite.
Lu et al. (2015) investigate the above three definitions of
trend and its impact on the profitability of candlestick pat-
terns. They find that the results do not depend on which defi-
nition of trend is used. As such, this article sticks with the
second definition for its simplicity. In this research, close
stock prices on the first trading days in the sample are used to
initialize the above EMA recursion.
Candlestick Patterns
Candlestick patterns can be classified into 1-day, 2-day,
and 3-day patterns (Figures 2, 3 and 4). Normally, a 1-day
represents a daily candlestick. If a pattern signals a con-
tinuation of an existing trend, then it is a continuation pat-
tern. In contrast, if it signals a change in a trend, then it is
a reversal pattern. Nison (1991) argues that reversal pat-
terns are more meaningful because it would help traders to
buy at the bottom and sell at the peak. Therefore, he sug-
gests that traders should pay more attention to reversal pat-
terns than continuation ones. Previous academic studies
(e.g., Caginalp & Laurent, 1998; Marshall, Cahan, &
Cahan, 2008) also focus solely on reversal patterns. These
reversal patterns can be grouped into bullish and bearish
ones. The bullish (bearish) patterns predict future prices
increase (decrease). This article would summarize these
1-day, 2-day, and 3-day patterns in turn.
There are six bullish and six bearish 1-day patterns
(Marshall et al., 2006). The bullish patterns are White
Marubozu (WM), Closing White Marubozu (CWM),
Opening White Marubozu (OWM), Long White Candle
(LWC), Dragonfly Doji (DD), White Paper Umbrella (WPU),
and Black Paper Umbrella (BPU). The bearish patterns are
Black Marubozu (BM), Closing Black Marubozu (CBM),
Long Black Candle (LBC), Opening Black Marubozu
(OBM), Gravestone Doji (GD), Black Shooting Star (BSS),
and White Shooting Star (WSS). The patterns are ordered
according to signal strength.
There are five well-known 2-day bullish reversal patterns.
They signal a change at the end of a downtrend. They are HP,
bullish engulfing, piercing line (PL), BullH, and bullish
kicking. There are also five well-known 2-day bearish rever-
sal patterns. They signal a change at the end of an uptrend.
They are descending hawk (DH), BearE, dark cloud cover
(DCC), bearish harami, and bearish kicking.
Figure 1. Candlestick charts.
Tharavanij et al. 5
There are four popular 3-day bullish reversal patterns. They
signal a change at the end of a downtrend. They are three white
soldier (TWS), three inside up (TIU), three outside up (TOU),
and morning star (MS). There are four popular 3-day bearish
reversal patterns.They signal a change at the end of an uptrend.
They are three black crows (TBC), three inside down (TID),
three outside down (TOD), and evening star (ES). All 3-day
patterns are just extension of 2-day patterns with an extra 1
day for confirmation (Marshall et al., 2006).
In general, there are three approaches for an exit strategy.
The first one is the MYR exit strategy introduced by Marshall
et al. (2006). The second one is the CL exit strategy sug-
gested by Caginalp and Laurent (1998). The third one is the
Lu-Shiu-Liu (LSL) exit strategy proposed by Lu et al. (2012).
The MYR exit strategy assumes that investors liqui-
date their positions at the end of the holding period. In
contrast, the CL exit strategy assumes that investors liq-
uidate their positions during the holding period. As such,
exit prices are average prices over the holding period.
The typical holding periods are 1-day, 3-day, 5-day, and
10-day. The candlestick trading strategy should not be
used for a period more than 10 days (Morris, 2006).
Unlike other methods, the LSL exit strategy has a vari-
able holding period. The LSL exit strategy assumes that
investors buy (sell) on bullish (bearish) signal and liqui-
date their position when bearish (bullish) patterns hap-
pen. The purpose is to study profitability from a long-term
perspective.

This article analyzes both MYR and CL exit strategies to
evaluate the impacts of exit strategies on profitability of can-
dlestick patterns. In fact, Lu et al. (2015) apply candlestick
trading strategies to the 30 component stocks of the DJIA
index over the 1992-2012 period and find that candlestick
patterns with the CL exit strategy, but not with the MYR exit
strategy, are profitable. They argue that the profitability of
the CL exit strategy comes from a risk sharing mechanism
when positions are unwound over the holding periods.
Though candlestick patterns with LSL exit strategy are
interesting and Lu et al. (2012) even find that certain bullish
reversal patterns generate positive abnormal returns in the
Taiwan stock market, this article does not cover LSL exit
strategy as we follow Morris's recommendation that candle-
stick patterns is for a short-term period, not more than 10
days (Morris, 2006).
Candlestick Filtering
Morris (2006) defines candlestick filtering as a method of
trading with candlestick patterns that is also supported by
other technical indicators. He argues that filtering would
improve trading profitability of candlesticks because it
removes premature patterns and confirms trading signals. In
fact, he finds that by filtering, the number of trades is signifi-
cantly reduced but the average gain per trade increases.
A presignal is generated when a technical indicator gives
an overbought or oversold signal. If the indicator gives an
overbought (oversold) signal, then only bearish (bullish)
candlestick patterns are filtered. This article uses Stochastics
(%D), RSI, and MFI as candlestick filters. They have the
advantage of ranging from 0 to 100 and give a clear over-
bought or oversold signal.
Stochastics (%D). The stochastic oscillator indicates a relative
position of a current price when compared with its price range
over a period. The range is used as indicators of support and
resistance levels. The oscillator itself is expressed as a per-
centage of this range. The number 0% and 100% would indi-
cate the bottom and the peak within the range, respectively.
The idea is based on the observation that turning points tend
to be at the extremes of the recent price range. Normally, the
numbers greater than the 80 level or lower than the 20 level
are in an overbought or oversold territory, respectively.

21 days (Colby, 2003). The typical periods are 5, 9, and 14
days (Wikipedia, 2017b). The lookback period of 9 days is
chosen in this case because of its closeness to the optimal
parameter (for a long position) of 8 days as reported in
Tharavanij, Siraprapasiri, and Rajchamaha (2015). The
Stochastics %D is just an EMA of %K over a period of 3
days (Colby, 2003).
When Stochastics %D goes above 80, it gives an over-
bought signal and the sell filter is turned on. Any candle-
stick pattern that gives a sell signal when Stochastics %D is
above 80 will be recognized as a filtered sell signal (Morris,
2006). Similarly, whenever Stochastics %D is below 20, it
gives an oversold signal and the buy filter is turned on. Any
candlestick pattern that gives a buy signal when Stochastics
%D is below 20 will be recognized as a filtered buy signal
(Morris, 2006).

RSI.The RSI indicates strength of upward price movements
when compared with downward price movements.Ahigh (low)
stock price when compared with its recent past would have a
high (low) RSI. The idea is that prices tend to be mean-revert-
ing. If it rises or falls rapidly, it tends to reverse soon and returns
to its mean. The RSI varies from 0 to 100. Normally, the num-
bers greater than the 70 level or lower than the 30 level are in an
overbought or oversold territory, respectively (Colby, 2003).
The RSI is computed by the following steps. First, calcu-
late the "U" and "D" variables according to the formulae
stated below. Then, compute their exponential moving aver-
ages over 14 days to derive "Ua" and "Da" (Colby, 2003).
The RSI is then calculated by the following equation:

When RSI goes above 70, it gives an overbought signal
and the sell filter is turned on. Any candlestick pattern that
gives a sell signal when RSI is above 70 will be recognized
as a filtered sell signal. Similarly, whenever RSI is below 30,
it gives an oversold signal and the buy filter is turned on.Any
candlestick pattern that gives a buy signal when RSI is below
30 will be recognized as a filtered buy signal.
MFI. The MFI is an approximation of a trading value over sev-
eral days. It ranges from 0 to 100. Normally, the numbers greater
than the 80 level or lower than the 20 level are in an overbought
or oversold territory, respectively (Wikipedia, 2017a). The MFI
is similar to the RSI in the sense that both measure positive
changes against total changes. However, the MFI uses volume,
whereas the RSI uses amounts of price changes.
The MFI is computed by the following steps. First, calcu-
late the "typical price" according to the formula below. Then,
multiply typical price and volume to derive the money flow.
The money flow is grouped into positive and negative types.
The positive (negative) money flow is defined as the 14-day
summation of money flow when the typical price is increas-
ing (decreasing). More specifically, the MFI is defined by the
following equation:
TP
MF TP Volume,
PMF MF if TP TP

where H, L, and C are high, low, and close price, respec-
tively; TP = typical price; MF = money flow; PMF = positive
money flow; and NMF = negative money flow.
When MFI goes above 80, it gives an overbought signal
and the sell filter is turned on. Any candlestick pattern that
gives a sell signal when MFI is above 80 will be recognized
as a filtered sell signal. Similarly, whenever MFI is below 20,
it gives an oversold signal and the buy filter is turned on.Any
candlestick pattern that gives a buy signal when MFI is
below 20 will be recognized as a filtered buy signal.
Method
The article applies a skewness adjusted t test (Johnson, 1978)
to test the null hypothesis that the mean return is zero, and
use the binomial test to test the null hypothesis that the win-
ning rate is just 50%. The "Winning Rate" represents the pro-
portion of positions with positive (negative) returns for
bullish (bearish) signals.
As stock return distributions may not follow a normal dis-
tribution, the use of a skewness adjusted t test is more appro-
priate than a normal t test. The details of a return calculation,
a skewness adjusted t test, and a binomial test are as
follows.
Return Calculation
This article assumes that traders buy a stock at its opening
price on the day after a bullish signal is detected. The stock
is held over a fixed period and then sold at the closing price
of a period. A holding period return is calculated. Similar to
Marshall et al. (2006) and Zhu et al. (2016), this article uses
raw returns instead of excess returns.
The returns calculated are holding period returns. The
holding periods are 1, 3, 5, and 10 trading days. Then, this
article calculates the means of all signaled returns of various
stocks with the similar holding periods to determine the opti-
mal holding periods for bullish and bearish signals. The
return formulae depend on the employed exit strategy.
For the MYR exit strategy, the holding period continuous
return is calculated by the following formula:
r C O
t h
c
t h t
+ +
= -
ln ln .
For the CL exit strategy, the holding period continuous
return is calculated by transforming a corresponding discrete
return. The specific formula is the following:
r

The superscript "c" denotes a continuous return, whereas
"d" denotes a discrete one. The variable "h" is the number of
trading days in a holding period. The variables "O" and "C"
mean open and close prices, respectively.

Skewness Adjusted t Test
This article uses a skewness adjusted t test developed by
Johnson (1978) to test profitability of candlestick patterns.
The skewness adjusted t test is a valid nonparametric test
even with biased distributions of return rates. This statistic is
calculated using the following formula:

Bullish (bearish) signals are valid only if their mean
returns are positively (negatively) significant. The one-tail t
test is applied.
Neyman and Pearson (1928), and Pearson andAdyanthya
(1928, 1929) show that skewness has a greater impact on the
distribution of the t statistics than kurtosis. A positive (nega-
tive) skewness in the return distribution would lead to a neg-
atively (positively) skewed sampling distribution of t
statistic. Sutton (1993) concludes that when the population
distribution is asymmetrical, the use of Johnson's statistics is
preferred to the t test.
Binomial Test
The probability of correct predictions or winning probability
is defined as the number of correct signals divided by the
total observed signals. A binomial test is used to check
whether candlestick patterns have a predictive power. The
probability of correction should be higher than .5 if candle-
stick patterns signal the future short-term returns.
The exact interpretation of winning probabilities
depends on the type of an exit strategy employed and
whether it is a bullish or bearish pattern. In the case of
MYR exit strategy, it is the probability that the holding
period return would be positive (negative) for a bullish
(bearish) signal. In the case of CL exit strategy, it is the
probability that the average price over the holding period
would be higher (lower) than the entry price, resulting in a
positive (negative) holding period return for a bullish
(bearish) signal.
The difference between the two means "np
0
" (the expected
number of success where p
0
= .5) and "np" (the actual num-
ber) is divided by the standard deviation to get the Z statistic
to test the null hypothesis:
Z
n p p
=
-
( )
0

.
Using the central limit theorem, the Z statistic has a nor-
mal distribution. The standard error is given as follow:

Data
Marshall et al. (2006) argue against the use of technical anal-
ysis on small or illiquid stocks because prospective profits
are not economically significant. Therefore, this research
studies stocks in the SET50 index. The sample period studied
covers 10 years from July 3, 2006, to June 30, 2016. The
SET50 constituents are stock used for calculating the index
during July 1, 2016, to December 31, 2016. The more recent
list is chosen for a relevancy reason. If component stocks do
not have full records during the sample period, then only
available records during the sample period are used. The data
are from the SETSMART database. The list of stocks is
reported in the appendix.
Empirical Results
This part discusses empirical results and test statistics,
namely, adjusted t test and binomial test. Tables 1 to 6 pro-
vide statistics of each pattern. The overall picture is that both
bullish and bearish candlestick reversal patterns are not use-
ful. The mean returns of most patterns are not statistically
different from zero. Even the ones with significant returns
have relatively low mean returns (from 0.07% [BPU
3D-MYR] to 0.84% [BullH 5D-MYR]) compared with risks
as measured by standard deviations (4.36% [BPU 3D-MYR],
7.04% [BullH 5D-MYR]). The binomial test results confirm
the finding that normally candlestick patterns cannot reliably
predict market directions. The rest of this part would be sepa-
rated into results from single-day patterns, 2-day patterns,
and 3-day patterns, consecutively.
In the case of bullish single-day patterns, most candlestick
patterns could not generate statistically significant positive
mean returns. The ones that did are WM, OWM, LWC, and
BPU. Only OWM has significant mean returns over all hori-
zons. The BPU comes close as its mean returns are significant
over all horizons except for 1 day. The WM and LWC have
significant mean returns only for a 10-day holding horizon.
The binomial test results show that the winning probability is
normally not significant. The notable exception is the OWM
for a 5- or 10-day holding horizon. Overall, the OWM has the
best performance. Its adjusted t statistics are highly signifi-
cant in all holding periods and for both MYR and CL exit
strategies. The mean returns are also the highest. This is a
surprise given that according to candlestick textbooks (e.g.,
Morris, 2006; Nison, 1991) this pattern does not give the
strongest bullish signal (in fact, that one belongs to WM). The
OWM, in fact, only gives the third strongest bullish signal
(after WM and CWM). This may indicate that signal strength
does not necessarily follow what is specified in candlestick
textbooks and may vary among stocks and stock markets.
Interestingly, the supposedly second strongest bullish signal,

the CWM pattern, in fact, has highly significant negative
mean returns. The binomial test confirms the above result as
the Z statistics are highly negatively significant. Traders could
make a profit (at least before transaction costs) on average
from selling when the CWM pattern happens instead of buy-
ing as suggested in candlestick textbooks.
In the case of bearish 1-day patterns, all patterns except
OBM do not have significant negative mean returns. Even
for the OBM pattern, the negative mean return (­0.08%)
is significant only for the holding period of just 1 day. In
addition, the binomial test results are all insignificant.
This implies that none of the bearish single-day patterns
could reliably predict market downturns. However, simi-
lar to the bullish CWM pattern case described above, most
bearish 1-day patterns, like CBM, LBC, GD, BSS, and
WSS, do not have negative mean returns as expected but

surprisingly have highly significant positive mean returns.
This implies that traders could make a profit (at least
before transaction costs) on average from buying instead
of selling as suggested in candlestick textbooks. Basically,
they behave more like bullish signals than bearish ones. In
addition, their binomial test results are negatively signifi-
cant, meaning that these patterns do, indeed, predict mar-
ket upturns.
In the case of bullish 2-day patterns, only BullH has sig-
nificant positive mean returns over all horizons. Returns of
all other bullish 2-day patterns are not significant. For bear-
ish 2-day patterns, none have significant mean returns except
DH with 1- to 3-day horizons. The winning probabilities are
also not significant. Unlike in the case of 1-day patterns,
almost all 2-day patterns have mean returns that are neither
positively or negatively significant. The only exceptions are

BearE and DCC which have positively significant mean
returns over a period of 5 to 10 days.
In the case of bullish 3-day patterns, only TIU has a sig-
nificant (at a 10% level) positive mean returns over three
trading days with MYR exit strategy. All winning probabili-
ties are not significant. For bearish 3-day patterns, none have
significant negative mean returns. Interestingly, like the case
of bearish single-day patterns, the TBC and TID patterns
have significant positive mean returns (for a 10-day horizon)
instead of expected negative ones. They behave, in fact,
more like bullish signals.
In summary, most candlestick patterns are not very useful
in terms of investment timing. Even the ones with statistically
significant returns do have high risks in terms of standard
deviations. For example, the OWM pattern, a single-day bull-
ish pattern, has the highest holding period return of 0.71% (10
days with MYR) with the associated standard deviation of
8.04%. In addition, the signal strength or direction (bullish or
bearish) do not necessarily follow those suggested in candle-
stick textbooks. For example, the CBM pattern, a 1-day bear-
ish pattern, has no significant negative mean returns as
expected but instead has significant positive mean returns. It
behaves more like a bullish pattern. In terms of exit strategies
(MYR vs. CL), this article does not find much difference but
the general observation that mean returns and standard devia-
tions of MYR tend to be higher than those of CL. This may
reflect the fact that the CL exit strategy allows traders to
divesting evenly over holding periods.

Filtered Candlestick Patterns

Tables S1 to S6, Tables S7 to S13, and Tables S14 to S18 in the
supplementary appendix for filtering with Stochastics (%D),
RSI, and MFI, respectively. The overall picture is that even
with filtering, candlestick patterns are still not useful. Among
profitable unfiltered patterns, filtering reduces the number of
trades dramatically, but the average mean returns and winning
probabilities do not significantly increase except for the LWC
with RSI filter. Among unprofitable unfiltered patterns, they
are still not profitable even with filters. The binomial test
results reveal that even with filtering, most candlestick pat-
terns cannot reliably predict market directions. The rest of this
part would be separated into results from 1-, 2-, and 3-day pat-
terns, consecutively.
Among single-day bullish patterns, the best strategy
changes from the OWM (unfiltered) to the LWC (filtered).
The second best strategy also changes from the BPU (unfil-
tered) to the WPU (with Stochastics %D filter). The RSI fil-
ter increases LWC profitability drastically from less than 1%
to higher than 1% in most cases; however, standard devia-
tions also increase. Similar to the unfiltered case, nearly all
filtered single-day bearish patterns could not generate sig-
nificant negative returns. The binomial tests confirm the
result that they could not reliably predict market downturns.
Among 2-day bullish patterns, the best unfiltered and fil-
tered strategy is consistently the BullH. The number of
trades decreases a little by filtering while average returns
and risks remain relatively the same. Among 2-day bearish
patterns, the DH strategy is the only profitable strategy with

ish case, the number of trades decreases a little by filtering

Among 3-day bullish or bearish patterns, none generate

Conclusion
This article investigates the profitability of candlestick bullish
and bearish reversal patterns when applied to component stocks
of the SET50 index for the 10-year period from July 3, 2006, to
June 30, 2016. The holding periods are 1 day, 3 days, 5 days,
and 10 days. Two exit strategies are studied. One is the MYR
exit strategy (Marshall et al., 2006) and the other is the CL exit
strategy (Caginalp & Laurent, 1998). The MYR applies a pre-
specified date to exit the market. In contrast, the CL sets an exit
price equal to an average holding period closing price, assum-
ing that investors liquidate their positions evenly within this
period. In terms of methodology, this study uses the skewness
adjusted t test (Johnson, 1978) and the binomial test.
The statistical analysis finds little use of both bullish and
bearish candlestick reversal patterns since the mean returns
of most patterns are not statistically different from zero.
Even the ones with statistically significant returns do have
high risks in terms of standard deviations. The binomial test
results also indicate that candlestick patterns cannot reliably
predict market directions.
Furthermore, this study finds that the signal strength or
direction (bullish or bearish) do not necessary follow those
suggested in candlestick textbooks. For example, the CBM
pattern, a single-day bearish pattern, has no significant nega-
tive mean returns as expected but instead has positive mean
returns. In terms of exit strategies (MYR vs. CL), this article
observes that results from MYR tend to have both higher
mean returns and higher standard deviations compared with
those from CL. In addition, this article finds that filtering
either by Stochastics (%D), RSI, or MFI generally does not
increase profitability nor prediction accuracy of candlestick
patterns.
This article has the following limitations. First, we do not
investigate the roles of trend, support, and resistance lines.
Second, our sample includes only components of the largest
50 stocks in the SET. It is possible that candlestick pattern is
more effective for smaller capitalized stocks. These could be
the topic for future studies.
