Abstract: Sexual selection theory argues that females invest more heavily in reproduction
than males and thus tend to be choosier in terms of mate choice. Sport may provide a
context within which females can gain information about male quality to inform this
choice. Males may be able to display attractive traits such as athleticism, strength, and
physique to females while participating in sport. We predicted that females would favor
males that participated in team sports over individual sports and non-athletes because team
sport athletes may be more likely to display qualities such as the ability to work well with
others and role acceptance. We used a questionnaire, a photograph, and manipulated
descriptions to gauge the effects of sport involvement, attractiveness, and status on 282
females' willingness to participate in various types of relationships. Team sport athletes
were perceived as being more desirable as potential mates than individual sport athletes and
non-athletes. It is suggested that team sport athletes may have traits associated with good
parenting such as cooperation, likeability, and role acceptance, and/or these athletes may be
better able to assert dominance in a team setting. Results are discussed in terms of further
implications and future research.

Introduction
Sexual selection theory argues that males tend to compete amongst themselves for
access to mates, and that females tend to be more selective of their mates than males
(Andersson, 1994). These sex differences are the result of the asymmetry in reproductive
investment between the sexes. The production of male gametes is considered to be
relatively cheap, and generally males in most non-human animals do not provide parental
care. Female investment in reproduction, however, is generally costly because they produce
large, energy rich gametes and often are the sole providers of parental care. Thus, females
can increase Darwinian fitness by carefully selecting mates that provide good genes for
their offspring or material benefits such as high quality parental care or resources that can
be used to aid in raising offspring (Andersson, 1994; Trivers, 1972).
Similarly, in humans, females can enhance their Darwinian fitness by choosing
partners who offer genetic benefits or resources (Buss, 1998). The assessment of mates in
light of genetic quality or resource-holding potential is thus critical and can occur in a
number of contexts in which males must compete on some level (Buss, 1998). Physical
competition through sport is an important and visible way that males compete amongst
each other. In particular, sport may allow males to demonstrate athletic qualities such as
speed and strength (Manning and Taylor, 2001). The importance of sport in terms of mate
competition has been self-reported by males. For example, they believe that traits such as
"acquire athletic ability" and "use risk in athletics" are attractive to females and important
to demonstrate when competing with other males (Walters and Crawford, 1993). Females
find males with athletic physiques to be more attractive than males with average physiques
(Dixon, Halliwell, East, Wignarajah, and Anderson, 2003; Li and Kenrick, 2006; Singh,
1995), and men have been shown to bias their exercise toward enhancing upper body
definition and gaining muscle mass (Jonason, 2007). Men may focus on enlarging the
upper body because females prefer males with a more pronounced V-shaped torso
(Jonason, 2007). In sum, the level of performance that a male attains within a sporting
context may provide an honest signal of his physical condition and ranking among other
males with respect to motivation, competitiveness and athletic ability. These signals may
thus render successful males as more attractive to females.
If sport is an appropriate context for assessing male quality, then a number of
hypotheses can be (and have been) tested. As one example, participants in sport should
have more sexual partners than non-participants, and the level of sport performance should
also predict the number of sexual partners. Faurie, Pontier, and Raymond (2004) provided a
questionnaire to French students who were either registered in sport courses or non-
sporting courses and these predictions were confirmed. Male students that competed in
sports self-reported more sexual partners than non-participants, and within athletes, higher
levels of performance were positively correlated with the number of partners (Faurie et al.,
2004).
If females are using participation in sport as a measure of male quality, the ability of
a male to display his quality may be dependent on the type of sport he participates in. For
example, male athletes that participate in team sports may be able to display more attractive
qualities than athletes that participate in sports in which individuals compete against one
another. By being part of a team, an athlete may be able to reliably display attractive
qualities amongst a group of males, a context that is not consistently available to individual
Female mate choice and sport

sport athletes. The team sport context may thus provide females with a greater opportunity
to assess a particular male's quality by providing a number of potential rivals for
comparison. Attractive qualities may include the ability to work with others and role
acceptance (Li, Kenrick, Bailey, and Linsenmeier, 2002, Minervini and McAndrew, 2006).
In addition, qualities associated with physical dominance and prowess may be easier to
display in a team sport context because athletes must compete for status against their team-
mates, as well as members of other teams.
There are a number of male traits other than sport participation that influence
female mate choice. Both physical attractiveness and status are important factors that have
been found to influence mate preferences (Bereczkei, Voros, Gal, and Bernath, 1997; Li et
al., 2002; Rhodes, Chan, Zebrowitz, and Simmons, 2003; Rhodes, Simmons, and Peters,
2005). Females tend to prefer physically attractive males, often for short term relationships,
and males of high status, often for long-term relationships (Singh, 1995). Both
attractiveness and status are thus important factors with which to compare the relative
effects of sport participation on female mate preferences.
In the present study, we use a questionnaire with a population of females to test a
series of predictions based on the hypothesis that sport participation is used by females to
assess male quality. We test three main effects, predicting that (a) females will prefer team
sport athletes over both individual sport athletes and non-athletes, (b) males of high status
will be preferred over males of low status, and (c) attractive males will be preferred over
less attractive males. We also test for interactions among the three main effects, predicting
that males participating in team sports, of high status, and physically attractive will be most
preferred relative to other male types.
Materials and Methods
Participants
The participants were 282 female undergraduate students from a central Canadian
university enrolled in a variety of academic programs in the natural (e.g., biology,
chemistry; n = 107) and social sciences (e.g., psychology, physical education, arts; n =
175). The majority of participants were enrolled in their first year of study (n = 169) while
the remaining individuals were in their second (n = 45), third (n = 29), and fourth years (n
= 39). The ages of the participants ranged from 18 to 29 years (Mage
= 19.50, SD = 1.74
years) and 114 participants indicated that they had some previous involvement in a sporting
context. Finally, participants also provided information on their own ethnicity, ethnic
preferences for mates, sexual orientation, and beliefs/behaviors regarding sexual practices.
Those described above represent participants who self-categorized as Caucasian, had no
specific preference or a preference for a Caucasian mate, were heterosexual, and not
opposed to sexual intercourse prior to marriage. Participants used in the analysis were
drawn from an initial pool of 374 participants.
Demographic questions
A series of demographic questions were asked of the participants: age, ethnicity,
program of study, current year of study, sexual orientation, ethnic preferences for mates,
current and past sport involvement, and relationship history and beliefs. These latter
questions assessed, via yes/no response options, whether or not the participants (a) had past
Female mate choice and sport
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 6(1). 2008. -116-
romantic relationships, (b) have a current romantic relationship, (c) believe in sexual
intercourse prior to marriage, and (d) are currently sexually active. Finally, participants
were asked if they were currently taking oral contraceptives and to provide an estimate of
when they expected their next menstrual period to begin.
Independent variables: Stimulus (picture) and description
Each participant received a picture of one of two possible Caucasian males (either
high or low in attractiveness) and one of six possible descriptions of this individual. To
assess the physical attractiveness of the two individuals in the pictures, a pilot study was
conducted with 35 female participants (who did not take part in the main study) similar in
demographic characteristics outlined in the Participants section above. The women were
asked to rate the attractiveness of twelve males based on black and white, non-smiling,
head-shot pictures. Attractiveness was assessed on a 7-point Likert-type scale from 1 very
unattractive to 7 very attractive. The two photos chosen for the main part of the present
study consisted of the individual rated most attractive (M = 5.49, SD = 1.44) and an
individual rated low in attractiveness (M = 2.49, SD = 1.04) as determined by this pilot
study. Mean rating differences among the pictures was found to be significant, Wilks'  =
.08, F(11,24) = 25.75, p < .001, and a post-hoc analysis demonstrated a significant
difference between the two pictures utilized in the present study (p < .001). Thus, it can be
reasonably concluded that the two pictures differed in physical attractiveness.
The information contained within the description was manipulated to highlight the
type of sport involvement of the individual (i.e., 3 levels; team sport vs. individual sport vs.
no sport involvement) and the degree of status he has obtained in that particular context
(i.e., 2 levels; high status vs. low status). Specifically, the description read:
This is Brian. He is a member of a(n) [either (a) varsity team sport, (b)
varsity individual sport, or (c) extra-curricular club that does not involve
physical activity and does not play sports]. He is ranked as one of the
[either (a) more skilled players within his sport/club and is regarded
highly, or (b) less skilled players within his sport/club and is not
regarded highly] by other members. He grew up in [location of study]
and has a younger sister and an older brother. He loves to eat out and
watches television occasionally. He loves dogs.
It should be noted that similar procedures and stimulus constructions have been used in past
research (e.g., Townsend and Levy, 1990). As a result of the above process, the main study
contained 12 independent conditions through the interaction of physical attractiveness (2
levels), sport involvement (3 levels), and status (2 levels).
Dependent variables
Subsequent to examining the picture and reading the description given to them,
participants responded to four 7-point Likert-type scales from 1 (not willing) to 7 (very
willing) assessing their willingness to engage in various levels of relationships with the
depicted male. These questions are similar to those used in previous research by Singh
(1995) and Furnham, Moutafi, and Baguma (2002). Specifically, the participants were
asked: (a) Please indicate your willingness to go on one date with this person, (b) Please
indicate your willingness to engage in a short term relationship with this person (less than 1
month), (c) Please indicate your willingness to engage in sexual intercourse with this
Female mate choice and sport

person, considering a situation where there is no risk of pregnancy or contracting an STD,
and (d) Please indicate your willingness to engage in a long term/serious committed
relationship with this person (more than 6 months).
Procedure
Ethical approval was obtained through the authors' university research ethics board
to conduct the study. Subsequent to consent being provided by course instructors,
participants were recruited through their undergraduate classes. At the conclusion of a
lecture, females were asked to remain seated and the general purpose of the study was
explained to them. Participants read a letter of information and completed a consent form if
they were interested in taking part. Upon receiving the completed consent form, the
researcher gave the questionnaire to the participants consisting of demographic questions, a
picture and description of a male (see above for details), and the Likert-style questions.
Participants were randomly assigned to one of the twelve conditions and were further asked
to complete the questionnaire individually. The data collection context was monitored by a
researcher to ensure that no interaction took place among participants.
Results
A 3 (sport involvement) x 2 (status) x 2 (physical attractiveness) between subjects
multivariate analysis of covariance was performed on the four dependent variables
associated with females' willingness to engage in various levels of relationships with their
depicted male: one date, short term, sexual intercourse, and long term. Adjustment was
made for three covariates: age, menstrual phase, and previous sport involvement of the
female participants.

Note. Scores for willingness variables range from 1 (not willing) to 7 (very willing).
These covariates were chosen based on previous research suggesting that mate
preferences are potentially influenced by these variables. For example, a study conducted
by Buunk, Dijkstra, Kenrick, and Warntjes (2001) demonstrated that preferences for mates
of both males and females are somewhat dependent on age. Specifically, these investigators
found that women typically preferred partners who were a similar age to themselves. With
regard to menstrual phase, for example, Scarbrough and Johnston (2005) noted that women
"tested during the high probability of conception phases of their menstrual cycle have been

fertile window" (p. 511). Finally, there is a large body of literature suggesting that our
choices for friends and potential mates are highly influenced by perceived similarities (see
Jones, Pelham, Carvallo, and Mirenberg, 2004). Given the focus of the present study (i.e.,
male sport involvement), controlling for previous sport experiences of female participants
was imperative.

Mean values for all variables can be found in Table 1. A 3-way factorial
MANCOVA was conducted. No significant 2 or 3 way interaction effects were found (p >
.05). Consequently, the following sections discuss the main effects that were found in the
present study.
Main Effect for Sport Involvement
The multivariate analysis indicated significant main effects for sport involvement,
Wilks'  = .93, F(8,528) = 2.40, p = 01, 2 = .04, indicating general differences in
willingness to engage in the various relationship levels based on team sport, individual
sport, and non-sport involvement. Univariate analyses revealed that the three conditions
differed with regard to willingness to go on one date with the depicted male, F(2,267) =
6.57, p = .002, 2 = .05 and engage in a long term relationship, F(2,267) = 5.78, p = .012,
2 = .04. However, the groups did not differ with regard to willingness to engage in a short
term relationship, F(2,267) = 2.00, p = .062, or sexual intercourse with the depicted male,
F(2,267) = 2.46, p = .067.

Post-hoc examinations of the two significant univariate findings yielded relatively

mean for the team sport condition (M = 4.56 + 1.68) was significantly higher than the
extracurricular condition (M = 3.93 + 1.72, p = .001) and approached significance in
relation to individual sport involvement (M = 4.11 + 1.70, p = .06). For willingness to
engage in a long term relationship, the mean for the team sport condition (M = 3.16 + 1.86)
was significantly higher in comparison to both the individual sport (M = 2.64 + 1.67, p =
.039) and extracurricular conditions (M = 2.63 + 1.61, p = .024).
Main Effect for Status
The multivariate analysis indicated significant main effects for status, Wilks'  =
.87, F(4,264) = 10.00, p < .001, 2 = .13, indicating general differences in willingness to
engage in the various relationship levels based on high vs. low status. Univariate analyses
revealed that the females were more willing engage in all four types of relationships with
high status males compared with low status males (see Figure 2). Specifically, these groups
differed significantly with regard to willingness to go on one date, F(1,267) = 28.12, p <
.001, 2 = .10, engage in a short term relationship, F(1,267) = 15.27, p < .001, 2 = .05,
engage in sexual intercourse, F(1,267) = 24.04, p < .001, 2 = .08, and engage in a long
term relationship, F(1,267) = 30.53, p < .001, 2 = .10.

The multivariate analysis indicated significant main effects for physical

differences in willingness to engage in the various relationship levels based on high vs. low
attractiveness of the males depicted in the pictures. Univariate analyses revealed that the
females were more willing to engage in all four types of relationships with the high
attractive male compared with the low attractive male (see Figure 3). Specifically, these
groups differed significantly with regard to willingness to go on one date, F(1,267) =

Discussion
The effect of sport participation on female mate preferences was modest relative to
both status and facial attractiveness. Both attractive males and males of high status
(independent of sport involvement) were significantly more desirable in all social contexts
considered. These results were expected given previous work (Bereczkei et al., 1997; Li et
al., 2002, Rhodes et al., 2003; Rhodes et al., 2005), but provide important benchmarks with
which to compare the effects of alternative factors influencing female mate preferences.
One of these alternative factors appears to be the type of sport a male may participate in.
Generally, the effects of sport involvement were significant but much smaller than physical
attractiveness and status. For example, the effect sizes for physical attractiveness and status
Female mate choice and sport
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 6(1). 2008. -121-
were 3-12 times greater than sport involvement. Nonetheless, it is clear that sport
involvement is a significant contributor to female mate choice in this study.
Overall, sport participation may be an important cue for female mate choice
because males can display qualities such as physical prowess and agility in this context
(Manning and Taylor, 2001). These qualities can provide insight into male body condition
and other components of phenotypic quality. More interesting, it was found in the present
study that females preferred males that participate in team sports over those that participate
in individual sports or non-participants. Two hypotheses can be constructed to explain
these apparent preferences. The first argues that team sport athletes exhibit behavioral traits
associated with good parenting skills and success at long-term relationships such as
cooperation, likeability, and role acceptance (Li et al., 2002; Minervini and McAndrew,
2006). Individuals exhibiting these characteristics would likely be better parents and long-
term mates.
Alternatively, or perhaps concurrently, males may be better able to assert
dominance in a team sport context because they can assume a high rank within the team as
well as in competition with other teams. In others words, a female may be able to better
assess a male's quality if he participates in a team sport through his relative rank on the
team (i.e., is the focus male the captain of the team or a "benchwarmer"?). There is
evidence that (a) females may use a mixed mating strategy when selecting a mate, (b)
dominance reflects genetic quality, and (c) high quality males are less likely to invest in
offspring (Havlicek, Roberts, and Flagr, 2005; Wayneforth, 1998). If this is the case,
females may prefer dominant males as short-term partners and prefer males that are more
willing/able to invest in offspring as long-term mates. Team sport athletes were most
desirable as long-term mates in our study but only marginally more desirable in a "date"
social situation, providing some support for the hypothesis that females prefer team sport
athletes because their behavior may better indicate their abilities in terms of parental
investment.
It is possible that females may be more attracted to team sport athletes than
individual sport athletes because of the perceived potential financial benefits team sport
athletes may accrue should they pursue their sport at the highest level. The mainstream
professional sports in North America are typically team sports, and professional athletes
often earn much higher salaries than the average. However, this perceived scenario seems
unlikely in the current study because of its context. The present study was conducted at a
small Canadian university where the probability of an individual becoming a professional
athlete is much less than for athletes in colleges and universities in the United States that
participate in the National Collegiate Athletics Association (i.e., NCAA). Thus, it is
unlikely that earning potential was a consideration when females assessed the desirability
of the candidate males in our questionnaire.
Given on-going concerns regarding decreasing sport and physical activity rates in
developed countries, the results of the present study raise interesting questions surrounding
motivations for sport participation. For example, do males perceive participation in team
sports (or sport in general) as a venue for displaying genetic quality? And, are motivations
for participation in team sports (or sport in general) driven in part by sexual selection? It is
perhaps pertinent at this point to indicate that these questions delve into more distal or
ultimate explanations for sport participation favored by evolutionary psychologists. In
contrast, a review of relevant sport literature highlights numerous proximal reasons
Female mate choice and sport
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 6(1). 2008. -122-
identified by participants that include, for example, skill improvement/competition, social
activities, general physical fitness enhancement, and other reasons such as simply having
something to do (Gill, Gross, and Huddleston, 1983). More specifically, decisions to
participate in sport "occur in connection with general socialization processes in people's
lives...[and] are influenced by the availability of opportunities, the existence of social
support, the processes of identity formation, and the cultural context in which decisions are
made" (Coakley and Donnelly, 2004, p. 110). A greater understanding of participation
motivation may be greatly enhanced by considering both proximal and distal approaches.
Nonetheless, as it currently stands, motivations associated with sexual selection are not
considered in the sport literature despite young male athletes being more sexually active
than non-athletes (Faurie et al., 2004). Although not yet explicitly tested, social factors
identified as being important for sport participation (e.g., Sirard, Pfeiffer, and Pate, 2006)
may include the acquisition of mating opportunities with females.
Another question of particular interest from an evolutionary perspective is the
motivations of parents for encouraging team sport participation in their male children.
Presumably, if parents encouraged male children to participate in sport, and male athletes
have higher mating frequency than non-athletes, then parents of athletes would reap
inclusive fitness benefits from their sons. Thus, evolutionary pressures may exist that have
led to the encouragement of children, particularly boys, to participate and excel at team
sports so that parents may maximize their fitness through the enhanced production of
grandchildren.
This study provides a number of interesting avenues to pursue. The first is the need
to apply a within-subjects design to more clearly understand the effects of sport
participation in female mate preferences. Second, specific delimitations were imposed on
this study. For instance, data analysis in the present study was limited to participants who
self-categorized as Caucasian, had no specific preference or a preference for a Caucasian
mate, and who were not opposed to sexual intercourse prior to marriage. Consequently, the
generalizability of results is limited to a population similar in characteristics. However, this
affords a number of research avenues to pursue in the future.
Third, the specific types of sports males may participate in may be critical in a
female's assessment of male quality. For example, the social profile of the sport that a male
participates in may be more important than whether the sport is team or individual in
nature. In North America, high profile sports also happen to be team sports, and so this link
may be a confounding factor in our study. In addition, some sports may require varying
degrees of muscularity and agility, and these traits may be more or less attractive to
females. Further work should attempt to disentangle this relationship and assess whether
the profile of the sport is important in mate choice.
Fourth, a study of female perceptions of traits that are associated with success in the
context of sport participants (both individual and team sports) is critical. We have
hypothesized that team athletes are more attractive because of specific personality traits,
but this remains to be tested.
Finally, our results may also have some impact on team dynamics from a sports
psychology perspective. If males are motivated to participate in team sports at least in part
to enhance mating opportunities, then managing team dynamics and encouraging role
acceptance may benefit from evolutionary insights.
