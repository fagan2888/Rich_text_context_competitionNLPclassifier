THE MAGIC INVESTIGATORS*
OBJECTIVE -- To estimate allele frequencies and the marginal and combined effects of novel
fasting glucose (FG)-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on FG levels and on risk of
impaired FG (IFG) among non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican Americans.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- DNA samples from 3,024 adult fasting par-
ticipants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (1991­1994)
were genotyped for 16 novel FG-associated SNPs in multiple genes. We determined the allele
frequencies and influence of these SNPs alone and in a weighted genetic risk score on FG,
homeostasis model assessment of -cell function (HOMA-B), and IFG by race/ethnicity, while
adjusting for age and sex.
RESULTS -- All allele frequencies varied significantly by race/ethnicity. A weighted genetic
risk score, based on 16 SNPs, was associated with a 0.022 mmol/l (95% CI 0.009­0.035), 0.036
mmol/l (0.019­0.052), and 0.033 mmol/l (0.020­0.046) increase in FG levels per risk allele
among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans, respectively. Ad-
justed odds ratios for IFG were 1.78 for non-Hispanic whites (95% CI 1.00­3.17), 2.40 for
non-Hispanic blacks (1.07­5.37), and 2.39 for Mexican Americans (1.37­4.14) when we com-
pared the highest with the lowest quintiles of genetic risk score (P  0.365 for testing hetero-
geneity of effect across race/ethnicity).
CONCLUSIONS -- We conclude that allele frequencies of 16 novel FG-associated SNPs
vary significantly by race/ethnicity, but the influence of these SNPs on FG levels, HOMA-B, and
IFG were generally consistent across all racial/ethnic groups.
Diabetes Care 33:2370­2377, 2010
Fasting glucose (FG) is associated
with future risk of type 2 diabetes
and cardiovascular disease (1­3).
Impaired FG (IFG) (FG between 5.6 and
7.0 mmol/l), which is the high end of the
nondiabetic FG distribution, is also a risk
factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovas-
cular disease (1,2,4,5). The prevalence of
type 2 diabetes and the complications as-
sociated with the disease vary signifi-
cantly by race/ethnicity (6). Researchers
conducting recent genetic association
studies have used homeostasis model as-
sessment of -cell function (HOMA-B) to
identify several loci that influence levels
of FG and -cell function (7­9). A meta-
analysis of genome-wide association data,
by the Meta-Analysis of Glucose and In-
sulin-Related Traits Consortium
(MAGIC), recently confirmed 16 com-
mon single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) associated with FG levels (10). In-
dex SNPs were in or near PROX1, G6PC2,
GCKR, ADCY5, SLC2A2, DGKB, GCK,
SLC30A8, GLIS3, ADRA2A, TCF7L2,
MTNR1B, FADS1, CRY2, MADD, and
C2CD4B (10). These associations were
discovered in white people of European
ancestry; the influence of these SNPs on
FG levels in nonwhite populations and
their allele frequencies in general-
population samples are unknown. The
frequencies of common disease-
associated alleles discovered by candidate
gene or genome-wide association studies
(GWASs) can differ significantly across
racial/ethnic groups (http://hapmap.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov), and in some cases, the risk
allele within a locus will differ on the basis
of race/ethnicity (11,12). Other studies
suggest that despite the substantial varia-
tions in allele frequencies, the genetic ef-
fects on common diseases are largely
consistent across racial/ethnic groups
(13). We addressed these concerns by
genotyping 16 confirmed FG-associated
SNPs in adults who completed the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES III; 1991­1994),

which allowed us to collect data from a
large, representative sample of the U.S.
population that included non-Hispanic
whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexi-
can Americans. We tested the hypotheses
that there is significant racial/ethnic vari-
ation in 1) SNP risk (FG raising) allele
frequencies, 2) the marginal and com-
bined effects of these 16 SNPs on FG lev-
els and HOMA-B, and 3) the combined
effect of these 16 risk SNPs on risk of IFG.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The NHANES III used
a stratified multistage probability design
to obtain a nationally representative sam-
ple of the civilian, noninstitutionalized
U.S. population. In the NHANES III, each
survey participant had a household inter-
view and a physical examination; a subset
of individuals had fasting blood sampling.
Blood specimens for DNA collection were
obtained from the NHANES III Phase 2
(1991­1994) participants aged 12
years. DNA lysates were created from cell
lines generated using Epstein-Barr­
transformed lymphocytes from these
blood specimens. We limited our analyses
to nondiabetic participants who were
aged 20 years and had fasted between 8
and 23 h before blood collection. Of
3,517 eligible participants, we excluded
162 participants who self-identified their
race/ethnicity as "other" and also ex-
cluded 331 participants who either self-
reported diabetes or had a FG level 7.0
mmol/l or who had an oral glucose toler-
ance test (OGTT) 11.1mmol/l, which
left 3,024 participants in the study.
FG, HOMA-B, IFG, and diabetes
definitions
Plasma glucose levels were measured by
hexokinase (COBAS MIRA; Roche Diag-
nostics, Montclair, NJ). We used HOMA
as a surrogate measure of -cell function
(HOMA-B; calculated as [20  fasting in-
sulin {IU/ml}/FG {mmol/l}  3.5]) (14).
We defined IFG as having a fasting
plasma glucose 5.6 mmol/l, but 7.0
mmol/l and diabetes as use of antidiabetes
medications (including insulin) or a fast-
ing plasma glucose 7.0 mmol/l (4).
SNP genotyping
We genotyped 16 SNPs that were con-
firmed as associated with FG levels among
nondiabetic people of European ancestry
in the MAGIC GWAS (10). We used SNP
rs573225 as a proxy (r2  1.0 in CEU) for
SNP rs560887 in G6PC2 and SNP
rs11558471 as a proxy (r2  1.0 in CEU)
for SNP rs13266634 in SLC30A8. Geno-
typing was performed with the use of
iPLEX (Sequenom) (15). The minimum
call rate was 98.1%, and all SNPs were in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) ac-
cording to the National Center for Health
Statistics criterion (if P  0.01 in two or
more race/ethnicity groups, HWE is
rejected).
Genetic risk score
We constructed a weighted genetic risk
score (GRS) to examine the combined ef-
fect of 16 SNPs on FG levels, HOMA-B,
and risk for IFG. We used the -coeffi-
cients from the published European an-
cestry GWASs of these FG-associated
SNPs (10). We multiplied these -coeffi-
cients by 0, 1, or 2, according to the num-
ber of risk alleles carried by each
individual, and then summed them. To
facilitate the comparison with the simple
GRS (summing the number of risk al-
leles), we divided the score by 0.948
(twice the sum of the -coefficients) and
multiplied by 32 (total number of alleles)
(16). Although a number of SNPs did not
show significant association with FG or
HOMA-B in the NHANES III, we as-
sumed, on the basis of GWAS results, that
each SNP is independently associated
with FG for computation of a weighted
GRS. This assumption might not be ap-
propriate if an index SNP is correlated
with the causal SNP in the discovery pop-
ulation but not so in other racial/ethnic
groups due to differences in linkage dis-
equilibrium patterns (17). We used an ad-
ditive genetic model for each SNP and
applied a linear weighting of 0, 1, or 2 to
genotypes containing 0, 1, or 2 risk alleles
(16). We fit the weighted GRS as a con-
tinuous variable and categorized it into
quintiles in multivariate analyses. In pre-
senting the results, we rounded the
weighted GRS to the whole number.
Statistical analysis
We calculated weighted allele frequencies
and their 95% CIs, stratified by race/
ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, and Mexican American)
using the NHANES sample weights. We
carried out HWE tests for each genetic
variant for each racial/ethnic group. To
test for differences in allele frequencies,
we pooled all racial/ethnic groups and
used 2 to test the differences across the
racial/ethnic groups. We used linear re-
gression modeling to evaluate the rela-
tionship between 16 SNPs and FG levels
and HOMA-B, adjusted for age and sex.
We examined the adjusted marginal effect
on FG by including one SNP at a time in
the model for each racial/ethnic group.
SNPs were coded as 0, 1, or 2 for those
who were noncarriers, heterozygous, or
homozygous for the risk (FG raising) al-
leles, respectively. We modeled the GRS
in a similar fashion by testing associations
of a per­risk allele increase with FG. For
the GRS models, we calculated adjusted
R2, with and without the GRS to deter-
mine the explained variance, by adding
the GRS in the models for each racial/
ethnic group. We tested for homogeneity
of effects of these SNPs in marginal and
GRS models across race/ethnicity by in-
cluding the interaction terms of SNP or
GRS with race/ethnicity in the regression
models using the pooled dataset and re-
ported the associated P value.
We used age- and sex-adjusted logis-
tic regression to evaluate the association
of the GRS with prevalence of IFG for
each racial/ethnic group. We modeled the
GRS to test the association of a per­risk
allele increase with odds of IFG. We also
categorized the GRS into quintiles to ex-
amine the trend of effect on risk of IFG.
We tested for homogeneity of the GRS
effect on IFG across race/ethnicity by in-
cluding the interaction term using the
pooled dataset. Statistical tests, using lin-
ear or logistic regression modeling, were
based on Satterthwaite adjusted-F statis-
tics. All tests were two sided, and a P value
of 0.05 at each locus or the GRS was
considered significant. To avoid nonre-
sponse bias among NHANES III partici-
pants for whom DNA were available, the
sample weights were recalculated for the
NHANES III DNA dataset by using previ-
ously described methods (18). We used
SUDAAN (version 10.0) and SAS (version
9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) statistical
software for our analyses to account for
the complex sampling design.
RESULTS -- There were 3,024 indi-
viduals available for this study, including
1,225 non-Hispanic white, 897 non-
Hispanic black, and 902 Mexican Ameri-
can participants. Compared with other
groups, FG was higher among Mexican
Americans, and HOMA-B was lower
among non-Hispanic whites (Table 1).
Allele frequencies of FG genetic
variants
All allele frequencies (16 SNPs) were sig-
nificantly different across racial/ethnic
groups (P  0.05). Risk allele frequencies
varied from 17.1% (rs4607517, GCK) to

among non-Hispanic blacks, and from
18.0% (rs7903146 (TCF7L2) to 86.5%

Americans (Table 2) (online appendix Ta-
ble 1, available at http://care.diabetes

Marginal effect of genetic variants on
FG and HOMA-B
We observed three SNPs (rs573225,
rs780094, and rs11558471) that were
significantly associated with FG levels
among non-Hispanic whites, one SNP
(rs10830963) among non-Hispanic blacks,
and three variants (rs573225, rs4607517,
and rs10830963) among Mexican Ameri-
cans (online appendix Tables 2 and 3).
However, the majority of -coefficients (37
of 48) showed positive associations in the
expected direction with FG levels among all
three racial/ethnic groups. We found no ev-
idenceofheterogeneityeffectsoftheseSNPs
on FG levels across racial/ethnic groups, ex-
cept for rs11885122 for which non-
Hispanic whites had lower FG and non-
Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans
had higher FG levels (P  0.009). Gener-

ally, similar patterns of associations of these
16 SNPs were seen for HOMA-B (online ap-
pendix Table 2).
Combined effects of genetic variants
on FG and HOMA-B
The number of risk alleles at 16 SNPs
ranged from 10 to 27 (median 19), 12 to
26 (median 20), and 10 to 26 (median 18)
among non-Hispanic whites, non-
Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans,
respectively. For the weighted GRS, the
corresponding numbers were 8­27 (me-
dian 17), 10­24 (median 18), and 9­26
(median 17), respectively. The GRS was
normally distributed in all three racial/
ethnic groups (Kolmogorov-Smirnov P 
0.001) (online appendix Fig. 1). FG in-
creased significantly across the quintile of
GRS for all racial/ethnic groups. Each ad-
ditional risk allele in the score was asso-
ciated with a 0.022, 0.036, and 0.033
mmol/l increase in FG among non-
Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,
and Mexican Americans, respectively (Ta-
ble 3). There was no evidence of a differ-
ent effect of the GRS on FG levels or
HOMA-B across race/ethnicity (P 
0.291 and 0.637 for testing heterogeneity
of the GRS on FG levels and HOMA-B
across race/ethnicity, respectively). In a
model including age and sex, the GRS ex-
plained more of the total variation in FG
in Mexican Americans and in non-
Hispanic blacks than in non-Hispanic
whites (Table 3). Generally, similar pat-
terns of associations of these 16 SNPs
were seen for HOMA-B (Table 3).
Combined effects of genetic variants
on IFG
The prevalence of IFG, adjusted for age
and sex, was lowest among non-Hispanic
blacks and highest among Mexican Amer-
icans. The adjusted odds ratios for IFG
were highest among Mexican Americans,
comparing people in the highest with
those in the lowest quintiles of the GRS
for all racial/ethnic groups (Table 4) (on-
line appendix Fig. 2). There was no evi-
dence of a different effect of the GRS on
risk for IFG across race/ethnicity (P 
0.365 for testing heterogeneity across
race/ethnicity). Each additional allele was
associated with a significant increased
risk of IFG for all racial/ethnic groups.
CONCLUSIONS -- Our findings
show that risk allele frequencies of the in-
cluded SNPs discovered in populations of
European ancestry differed significantly
by racial/ethnic group, consistent with

the findings of other studies and HapMap
estimates (11,12). However, despite sig-
nificant variations in allele frequencies,
the patterns of influence of these SNPs on
FG levels, HOMA-B, and IFG were gener-
ally consistent across racial/ethnic
groups. A GRS derived by the combina-
tion of these 16 SNPs was weakly, yet sig-
nificantly, associated with an increase in
FG levels, a decrease in HOMA-B, and an
increase in risk for IFG in all racial/ethnic
groups. Our findings suggest that the ge-
netic variants at these glycemic loci, dis-
covered in the white population of
European ancestry, also contribute to the
elevated FG and reduced HOMA-B
among non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican
Americans.
The 16 FG-associated SNPs are lo-
cated in or near genes involved in multi-
ple biological pathways (10). Some of
these SNPs were also associated with type
2 diabetes (19­21), and a few have been
replicated in non-European populations
(22,23). Our study includes the most up-
dated SNPs associated with FG and esti-
mates their frequencies and effects in a
nationally representative sample of the
U.S. population. Our results suggest that
with an adequate sample size (not neces-
sarily as large as for a GWAS), these FG-
associated SNPs would likely be
replicated among non-Hispanic blacks
and Mexican Americans.
Although FG levels seem tightly reg-
ulated within a narrow range by a feed-
back mechanism that targets a particular
FG set point for each person (24), FG lev-
els vary substantially among nondiabetic
populations, and an estimated 25­40% of
the variation may be explained by genetic
factors (7). Many studies have suggested
that elevated FG levels are associated with
multiple health conditions, including risk
for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular dis-
eases (1,2,4,5). These diseases represent a
major burden of disease in many popula-
tions (25). Identification of populations at
high risk of developing type 2 diabetes
has great public health importance. Our
findings suggest that a GRS, on the basis
of these FG-associated SNPs, is signifi-
cantly associated with IFG, but it is un-
clear if these SNPs can improve
predictions for risks of type 2 diabetes or
cardiovascular disease in the general pop-
ulation. Further studies are also needed to
examine the possible associations of these
SNPs with type 2 diabetes and cardiovas-
cular diseases in different races and
ethnicities.

Genetic variants and fasting glucose levels

these SNPs explain only a small percent-
age of the total variations in FG levels and
HOMA-B (3%), suggesting that addi-
tional loci exist. These loci may be com-
mon genetic variants with small effects,
rare variants with larger effects, or vari-
ants that strongly interact with each other
or with environmental factors (in which
the number and effect size remain un-
known). These interactions are undoubt-
edly important but complicated to model;
their exploration is beyond the scope of
our study.
The major strengths of our study in-
clude the availability of FG and HOMA-B
measurements from a nationally repre-
sentative sample of the U.S. population
with multiple racial/ethnic groups and the
genotyping of the 16 most updated FG-
associated SNPs. There are several limita-
tions of our study. First, these FG-
associated SNPs were discovered among
populations of European ancestry and
may be proxies for the causal variants. It is
well known that linkage disequilibrium
patterns vary significantly by race/
ethnicity (17), and it is unclear if linkage
disequilibrium might break down for
some of these SNPs in other racial/ethnic
groups (online appendix Fig. 3). Addi-
tional fine mapping in all three race/
ethnic groups is needed. Second, we
replicated a limited number of SNPs--
even among non-Hispanic whites--that
were significantly associated with FG lev-
els or HOMA-B in the NHANES III. As
indicated in the power calculation (online
appendix), we had limited sample size to
detect an effect size of 0.07 mmol/l in
FG per allele for each individual SNP. The
most likely explanation for the lack of sig-
nificant association was the limited sam-
ple size of fasting individuals from the
NHANES III. Since these were GWAS-
confirmed, FG-associated SNPs (at least
among non-Hispanic whites), we in-
cluded all SNPs in our analysis. However,
using the GRS as a continuous variable,
we have adequate power to detect an ef-
fect size as low as 0.016 mmol/l per risk
allele. When including only the 11 SNPs
that showed the expected direction of ef-
fects for FG and HOMA-B, the association
of the GRS appeared to be stronger,
though the patterns remained unchanged
(results not shown). At least for non-
Hispanic whites, a larger sample size
would not likely change the conclusions
since the majority of the SNPs' effects are
in the expected direction, consistent with
studies in European populations (10).
Third, we calculated the weighted GRS
for the three racial/ethnic groups on the
basis of the published -coefficients from
populations of European ancestry be-
cause of a lack of estimates for other
racial/ethnic groups (10). These -coeffi-
cients might not be appropriate for other
populations. However, the consistent ef-
fects of the GRS on FG, HOMA-B, and
IFG across racial/ethnic groups suggest
that the weighting was not totally inap-
propriate in these populations. In addi-
tion, the pattern of association between
weighted and unweighted GRS on FG,
HOMA-B, and IFG were consistent (on-
line appendix Tables 4 and 5).
In summary, our results suggest that
the allele frequencies of FG-associated
SNPs varied significantly by race/
ethnicity. However, the patterns of
combined effects of these SNPs on FG
levels and HOMA-B were consistent
across the different racial/ethnic
groups. A GRS that was based on 16
SNPs was significantly associated with
risk of IFG among all racial/ethnic
groups, which may make it useful for
the identification of people who are at
high risk for developing diabetes.
