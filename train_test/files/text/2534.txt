Overweight Adolescents and Life Events in Childhood
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Psychosocial stress in
childhood has been associated with a greater risk of future
overweight, although the associations have not always been
consistent, the types of psychosocial stressors have often been
somewhat extreme, and moderators of the association have
rarely been examined.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Experiencing many negative life events
in childhood, particularly with chronicity or events that are family
health related, increases risk of overweight by age 15 years.
Maternal obesity and greater delay of gratification for food each
intensify this risk.
abstract
OBJECTIVES: To test the association of life events in childhood with
overweight risk in adolescence; to examine the effects of chronicity,
timing, intensity, valence, and type of life events; and to test potential
moderators.
METHODS: Mothers of children enrolled in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of
Early Child Care and Youth Development responded to the Life Expe-
riences Survey at ages 4, 9, and 11 years. Using logistic regression
analysis, we tested the association of experiencing many negative life
events with being overweight at age 15 years, controlling for child
gender, race/ethnicity, maternal education, and maternal obesity.
Child gender, maternal education, maternal obesity, child's ability to
delay gratification for food, and maternal sensitivity were tested as
moderators.
RESULTS: Among the 848 study children (82% non-Hispanic white),
experiencing many negative life events was associated with a higher
risk of overweight (odds ratio: 1.47 [95% confidence interval: 1.04­2.10]).
Greater chronicity and negative valence of the event were associated with
greater overweight risk; timing of exposure and maternal reported impact
of the event were not. The association was more robust for events related
to family physical or mental health and among children of obese mothers
and children who waited longer for food.
CONCLUSIONS: Children who experience many negative life events are
at higher risk of being overweight by age 15 years. Future work should
investigate mechanisms involved in this association, particularly those
connected to appetitive drive and self-regulation; these mechanisms
may hold promise for obesity prevention strategies. Pediatrics

Psychological and physiologic adapta-
tiontochronicstress,orallostatic load,1
has important implications for health
and disease. The association between
psychosocial stressors and risk of child-
hood obesity has been documented
in several studies,2­8 although reports
have provided less robust support for
the association than anticipated,9 had
null findings,10­13 or shown evidence of
moderation according toage,9 gender,4,5
or other factors.11,12 Improved under-
standing of the association between psy-
chosocial stress and childhood obesity
would inform interventions.
The definition of psychosocial stressors
inpreviousstudieshasvaried,withmost
studies combining various stressors
into risk indices that include parental
mental3,4,8,11,12 and physical8,11,12 health,
child violence exposure,3­6,12 socioeco-
nomic stressors,4,6,8,9,11,12 and nonoptimal
family structure and functioning.6,8,11,12
Another approach involves asking par-
ents to report events that occurred
and to rate their impact. A checklist of
events allows the inclusion of common
events, and the parent (as opposed to
the researcher) assigns the event
a negative, positive, or neutral valence.
Only 3 studies have used this approach,
and the association of life events with
the child's obesity risk was in-
consistent.7,10,13
The current study had 3 objectives: (1)
to test the association of life events at
ages 4, 9, and 11 years with overweight
at age 15 years among US children of
diverse socioeconomic status; (2) to
examine the effects of chronicity, tim-
ing, intensity, valence, and type of event
on overweight; and (3) to test moder-
ation by factors linked with increased
appetitive drive (ie, the desire to eat)14
or diminished self-regulatory capacity
(ie, the ability to restrict intake).15 We
specifically hypothesized that the child
being less able to delay gratification for
food, or having an obese or less sen-
sitive mother, represented biological
and environmental factors that could
intensify any effect of experiencing
negative life events on overweight.
METHODS
Sample
We used data from the Eunice Kennedy
Shriver National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development Study of Early
Child Care and Youth Development,
a longitudinal cohort of 1364 families
from 10 US sites commencing at the
time of the child's birth in 1991 (https://
secc.rti.org). This study was approved
by the institutional review boards of all
participating institutions.
Anthropometricdataatage15yearswere
available for 864 children, of whom 863
had at least 1 life event measure, and 848
had complete data for gender, race/
ethnicity, maternal education, and ma-
ternalweightstatus.The848participants
(82% non-Hispanic white) included in the
analyses, compared with the excluded,
incomplete sample, were less likely to be
male (49.5% vs 50.5%; P = .04) and had
mothers with more education (14.43
years vs 13.91 years; P , .001). There
was no difference in race/ethnicity.
Main Predictor: Life Events
Mothers completed an adapted version
oftheLifeExperiencesSurvey16 whenthe
child had a mean 6 SD age of 4.7 6 0.1,
9.0 6 0.3, and 11.0 6 0.3 years. Mothers
reported whether each of 71 events had
occurred in the last year, and if it oc-
curred, rated the impact on a 7-point
Likert scale, from ­3 (extremely nega-
tive) to 0 (no impact) to 3 (extremely
positive). Number of negative life events
was defined as the sum of all events
endorsed thatwere also ratedas having
a negative impact (­1 to ­3). The num-
ber of negative life events at each age
was then averaged across ages. We
categorized mean number of negative
life events as "many," defined as the
highest quartile (range: 4.5­17.3 mean
number of negative life events across
the 3 age points) versus "not," defined
as the lowest 3 quartiles (range: 0­4.3).
We created a chronicity variable, de-
finedasthenumberofagepointsachild
was in the top quartile: never (54.0%),
once (27.2%), and at 2 (13.8%) or 3
(5.0%)yearsofage.Wecreatedatiming
variable to reflect the ages at which the
child was in the top quartile: early only
(inthetopquartileatonlyage4yearsor
only ages 4 and 9 years; n = 102), late
only (in the top quartile at only age 11
years or only ages 9 and 11 years; n =
147), and never (n = 458). Children in
the top quartile at all 3 ages (n = 42) or
intermittently (top quartile only at age
9 years, or top quartile at ages 4 and 11
years but not age 9 years; n = 99) were
excluded from the timing analysis.
Impact ratings (­1 to ­3) were reverse
coded, summed at each age (range: 1­
182 [age 4 years], 1­47 [age 9 years],
and 1­45 [age 11 years]) and averaged
across ages to create an impact of
negative life events variable. Total num-
ber of life events, regardless of whether
the impact rating was positive, negative,
or neutral, was summed at each age and
then averaged across ages, with the top
quartile defined as "many life events."
We created 4 categories of negative life
events according to author consensus:
parent or family physical or mental
health and well-being (ie, family health;
15­18 items, depending on age [eg,
"serious illness or injury of close family
member," "took prescription drugs for
at least 1 month to help with mental
problems"]; parental work, school, or
financial stability (ie, family finances;
15 items [eg, "foreclosure on mortgage
or loan," "fired or laid off from job,"
"return to work"); emotional aspects of
relationships (ie, family relationships;
14 items [eg, "trouble with in-laws,"
"argument or conflict with husband/
partner," "divorce"); and family struc-
ture, routine, and caregiving (10 items;
eg, "birth or adoption of a child," "child

started school," "change in child cus-
tody arrangements," "need to care for
aging family member"). The number of
events in each category was averaged
across ages, and the top quartile for
each category was defined as "many."
Outcome: Overweight at Age 15
Years
Height and weight were measured by
using a standardized protocol at age 15
years. Overweight was defined as a BMI
$85th percentile for age and gender
based on the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention growth charts.17
Covariates
Childgender,race/ethnicity(non-Hispanic
white versus not), and maternal edu-
cation (continuous [in years]) were in-
cluded as covariates. The data set
includes only maternal BMI by self-
report when the child is age 15 years.
Mothers' images on videotape at child
ages 15, 24, and 36 months were
assigned a weight status ranging from
1 (thinnest) to 9 (heaviest) by using a
standard pictorial rating scale,18 an
approach with demonstrated validity,19
and ratings were then averaged. The
mean maternal weight status rating
correlated with maternal BMI when the
child was aged 15 years (r = 0.74).
Delay of gratification at age 4 years was
assessed by using the Mischel and
Ebbesen self-imposed waiting task.20
The child was told that the examiner
was going to leave the room, and if the
child could wait until the examiner
returned, he or she would be allowed to
eat a large quantity of a preferred food
(candy, animal crackers, or pretzels). If
the child could not wait, he or she would
be allowed to eat only a small quantity.
Children who waited were considered
to have delayed gratification.
Parenting sensitivity was defined as the
mean sensitivity z score coded from video-
taped structured mother­child play inter-
actions21,22 at ages 15, 24, and 36 months.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted by
using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc,
Cary,NC).For the9.7%ofthesamplethat
was missing the number of negative life
events(totalorineachcategory),impact
rating score, or total number of life
events at 1 or 2 of the 3 age points, these
values were imputed. Descriptive sta-
tistics were used to characterize the
sample, and x2 and t tests were used to
evaluate the association of each covar-
iate with overweight at age 15 years. We
used multiple logistic regression anal-
ysis to evaluate the association of mean
negative life events in childhood with
being overweight at age 15 years, con-
trolling for child race/ethnicity, child
gender, maternal education, and ma-
ternal weight status. We next reran this
model using as the predictor our cre-
ated categorical variable "many nega-
tive life events." Four new models were
then retested, rerunning this fully ad-
justed model and replacing the many
negative life events variable individually
with each of the following variables: (1)
chronicity of negative life events; (2)
timing of negative life events; (3) impact
of negative life events; and (4) many life
events (of positive, negative, or neutral
valence). To test the independent effect
of each type of negative life event, we
included the 4 different types of nega-
tive life events (family health, family
finances, family relationships, and fam-
ily structure, routine, and caregiving),
each coded categorically as "many" ver-
sus "not" simultaneously in the model.
Four additional models were tested, in-
dividually including interactions of the
categorical many negative life events
variable with child gender, maternal
education, maternal weight status, the
child's ability to delay gratification, and
parenting sensitivity. Adjusted odds ra-
tios (ORs) and their corresponding 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were calcu-
lated from all models.
RESULTS
Table 1 displays characteristics of the
sample and bivariate associations with
overweight. The main effect of each life
event variable in the fully adjusted
model is shown in Table 2. The mean
number of negative life events experi-
enced in childhood independently pre-
dicted a higher risk of overweight in
adolescence (OR: 1.08 [95% CI: 1.01­
1.14]). Experiencing many negative life
events also independently predicted
a higher risk of overweight (OR: 1.47
[95% CI: 1.04­2.10]).
Chronicity was important; experiencing
many negative life events at $2 time
points compared with never experienc-
ing such events was associated with
a higher risk of overweight (OR: 1.55
[95% CI: 1.03­2.34]); experiencing many
negative life events just once was only
marginally associated withahigherrisk
of overweight (OR: 1.37 [95% CI: 0.95­
1.98]). Experiencing many negative life
events at $2 time points was not as-
sociated with a higher risk of over-
weight than experiencing many life
events at just 1 time point (OR: 1.14 [95%
CI: 0.72­1.78]). With regard to timing of
experiencing many negative life events,
although there was a marginal effect of
early only versus never, as well as late
only versus never, there was no main
effect of early only versus late only (OR:
1.11 [95% CI: 0.63­1.96]). The impact of
the negative life events was not associ-
ated with risk of overweight (OR: 1.00
[95% CI: 0.99­1.02]). The total number of
life events (positive, negative, or neutral
impact) was not associated with
a higher risk of overweight (OR: 1.36
[95% CI: 0.95­1.94]). When different
types of negative life events were in-
cluded simultaneously in the model,
only family health remained a signifi-
cant predictor of overweight (OR: 1.81
[95% CI: 1.21­2.72]).
The interactions of many negative life
events with child gender and maternal
education were not significant (P = .38
e1508 LUMENG et al
and P = .81, respectively). The in-
teraction of maternal weight status
with many negative life events was
suggestive (P = .12). Among children of
mothers with a figure rating $5 (a
value sensitive and specific for obesity
in previous work19) (n = 309), the as-
sociation of negative life events with
overweight was significant (OR: 2.02
[95% CI: 1.25­3.52]). Among children of
mothers with a figure rating ,5 (ie,
nonobese) (n = 539), the association of
negative life events with overweight
was not significant (OR: 1.15 [95% CI:
0.70­1.88]). The interaction of the
child's ability to delay gratification and
negative life events was also sugges-
tive (P = .07). Among children who
delayed gratification (n = 399), the as-
sociation of negative life events with
overweight was significant (OR: 1.96
[95% CI: 1.14 ­ 3.3]). Among children
who did not delay gratification, the
association of negative life events with
overweight was not significant (OR:
1.02 [95% CI: 0.59­1.76]). The in-
teraction of parenting sensitivity with
negative life events was not significant
(P = .31).
DISCUSSION
Experiencing many negative life events
during childhood increased the risk of
overweightatage15yearsindependent
of child gender, race/ethnicity, mater-
nal education, and mother's weight
status in these study subjects. The
more chronic the exposure, the stron-
ger the effect, although the timing of
the exposure did not matter. Mother-
reported intensity of negative impact
was not associated with overweight
risk. The valence of the life event mat-
tered: events perceived as negative
were associated with increased over-
weight risk, but total events were not.
The type of negative event also mat-
tered: events related to family health
were most robustly associated with
adolescent overweight, independent of
whether there were also many life
events related to family finances, rela-
tionships, structure, routines, and care-
giving. The effect of negative life events
was equally robust in both boys and
girls and among children of mothers
with varying levels of education. The
association was more robust among
children of mothers with a higher
weight status as well as among chil-
dren who waited for a larger amount of
food at age 4 years.

Our finding that chronicity of negative
life events is an important predictor of
overweight risk requires replication,
particularlybecause2previousstudies
have reported conflicting results,
finding greater chronicity associated
withbothhigher5 andlower4 overweight
risk. Our finding that the association
did not differ based on the timing of
exposure to negative life events is
similar to most4,7,8 (but not all9,11) pre-
vious studies, suggesting that there
does not seem to be a developmental
window in childhood during which the
association of negative life events or
stressors with overweight is more ro-
bust. Our finding that the maternal-
reported impact of negative life events
was not associated with overweight
risk may be consistent with a previous
study demonstrating that the objective
report of stressors in the home was
predictive of child obesity, whereas the
parent's self-reported perceived stress
was not.8 These results suggest that
negative life events may have an impact
on overweight risk even if they are not
perceived as intensely stressful by the
parent. This finding may occur either
because the parent does not recognize
the effect of the life events on the child
or because the life events affect the
child's stress physiology but not the
observable behavior.23 To our knowl-
edge, our findings that the valence of
events is important, and that some
types of negative life events are more
robustly associated with adolescent
overweight, have not previously been
reported.
Wedidnotdetectmoderationaccording
togender,unlike2previousstudiesthat
examined moderation and found more
robust associations in girls.4,5 Given
that eating in response to stress is re-
ported more commonly in women,24,25
potential gender differences deserve
additional consideration. We did not
detect moderation according to ma-
ternal education, consistent with the
existing literature in which the associ-
ation has been identified in samples of
varying and diverse socioeconomic
status.3­8
The finding that the association of neg-
ative life events with overweight was
more robust among children of obese
mothers differs from the single pre-
vious study examining this question.7
Obese mothers may have more obesity-
promoting home environments, which
could potentiate the effect of negative
life events. They may also share the
same neurobiology with their child that
promotes excessive eating in response
to stressors (eg, hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal axis functioning,14 differences
in neural circuitry related to food re-
ward,26 genetic variants associated
with eating behaviors [including both
emotional eating and cognitive re-
straint]27).
The finding that the association was
morerobustamongchildrenwhowaited
foralargerquantityoffoodwascontrary
to our expectations, as well as contrary
to a recent study which found that the
abilitytodelaygratificationmediatedthe
association of psychosocial risk with
child BMI.28 We hypothesize that the
child's delay of gratificationforfoodmay
reflect not just a general capacity for
self-regulation but also how much the
child desires the food or finds the food
to be a motivator. Several studies have
found that the reduced ability to delay
gratification for food,29­31 as well as for
nonfood items (toys),29 is associated
with more rapid rates of weight gain
and future obesity risk. This classic be-
havioral task using food may be tapping
into more than just self-regulatory ca-
pacity but also interindividual differ-
ences in children's motivation to attain
a larger quantity of a palatable food or
sensitivity to reward.32 The effect of
negative life events on the development
of overweight may occur through in-
creased appetitive drive, as opposed to
reduced self-regulatory capacity. In
addition, not all children who experi-
ence significant stress respond with
greater impulsivity; rather, some use
more positive coping strategies.33
Understanding these pathways should
be a focus of future work.
There are several mechanisms through
which negative life events may be as-
sociated with future overweight. Neg-
ative life events may lead to increased
food consumption,34­38 particularly
comfort foods, which contribute to re-
lieving stress at a neurobiological
level.14 Negative life events may also
lead to poor sleep or disruption of
household routines, which have been
linked to increased obesity risk.39,40
Negative life events may also contrib-
ute to child behavioral or mental health
problems, which have each been linked
to childhood obesity.41,42 Previous work
has also shown that under conditions
of stress, the brain triggers changes in
metabolism that can lead to excessive
weight gain.43
Strengths of our study include its rela-
tively large, prospective, and socioeco-
nomically and geographically diverse
sample. Of the studies that measured
negative life events as we did,7,10,13 our
study included the most detailed mea-
sure. Limitations include that our sam-
ple was primarily white. Our study, like
most previous work,4,5,7­13 asked moth-
ers to describe events or stressors in
the home but did not ask children di-
rectly about their experience of these
events or stressors.
CONCLUSIONS
Early school-aged children experienc-
ing many negative life events are at
higher risk of being overweight by age
15 years. At present, clinicians might
consider attending to the possibility of
increases in overweight risk among
children experiencing a substantial
number of negative life events con-
currently at any point in childhood, as
well as children living in households in
e1510 LUMENG et al
which adults or family members are
experiencing life events related to their
own physical ormental health and well-
being. As the mechanism becomes
better understood, interventions could
be developed to better target the
mechanism of association to prevent
obesity. Investment in parenting and
early childhood education programs,
whichcanmitigateearlylifeadversity,44
may be a valuable focus for policies
targeting childhood obesity.
