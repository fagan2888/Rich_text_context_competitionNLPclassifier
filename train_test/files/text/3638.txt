Introduction
Japanese municipalities are increasingly active in obtaining
the institutional acknowledgment for the international status
for their characteristics in natural, geographical, or human
activities. We call these recognition processes and systems
as "certification" in this article. The example of these certi-
fications include three programs of or affiliated with the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO), namely the most prestigious
World Natural Heritage, the Man and the Biosphere
Programme (MAB; "Ecopark" in Japanese term), and the
recently established Global Geoparks Network (GGN). For
the Geoparks, there is a domestic registration at the national
level of Japan. Globally Important Agricultural Heritage
Systems (GIAHS), a program related to agricultural practice
by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the
United Nations, has started its first designation in 2011 for
Japan.
The decision-making processes are different from case
to case. In the 1970s, for the initial designation of munici-
palities of the MAB, it was a classical "top-down" style in
which the Agency of Environment (currently Ministry of
Environment) hardly consulted the local municipalities.
In recent years, local policy makers, including governors,
mayors, and official organizations of the municipalities from
tourism or education, have become increasingly involved.
Increase of the number of tourists is expected in these
movements, which is often not compatible with the imple-
mentation of the concept of environmental conservation and
biodiversity.However, there is confusion observed. The stan-
dards and criteria for the selections are less clear for the
GIAHS, MAB, and GGN (or its national registration) com-
pared with those of the World Natural Heritage. The institu-
tional settings for the three systems of GIAHS, MAB, and
GGN are relatively new, and the policy institution, including
central and local governments and municipalities, is on the
phase of adaptation. The unclear lines as to which ministry or
administrative bodies are in charge tend to cause uncertainty

Analysis of Japanese Municipalities With
Geopark, MAB, and GIAHS Certification:
Quantitative Approach to Official Records
With Text-Mining Methods
Ryo Kohsaka1 and Hikaru Matsuoka2
Abstract
We analyzed the discussions of Japanese municipalities in their process for obtaining certifications for the Geoparks by
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Man and the Biosphere Programme
(MAB) by the UNESCO, and the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage systems (GIAHS) by the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The official records at the municipality diet were analyzed in a quantitative
manner from 2011 to 2013. As the first step, we analyzed the eight municipalities of Noto and Sado for the GIAHS, the cities
Itoigawa and Hakusan for the Geopark, and Katsuyama Yamanouchi village from Nagano for the MAB. As individual examples,
we analyzed City of Suzu with GIAHS, Itoigawa (Geopark), and Yamanouchi town (MAB) with the text-mining approach. For
the GIAHS, it was clear that the larger municipalities with city status tended to discuss certification issues more frequently
than the smaller towns and villages. Terms such as conservation and certification tended to be used with GIAHS at the Suzu
City. The term brand was used with GIAHS and MAB but not for the Geopark. The findings using quantitative methods are
at initial stage for analysis of municipality strategies and require further future research.

and confusion because Japan is made of highly centralized
states with relatively clear administrative boundaries, par-
ticularly at the national level. The green issues or sustainable
tourisms involve similar confusion. Yamamura (1994) iden-
tifies the sectionalism in environmental problems. In a simi-
lar vein, Ichikawa (2008) identifies the inner challenges of
the Ministry, using the World Heritage site of Yakushima as
an example.
There are uncertainties as to the governance and the appli-
cation of the certificate. For example, at least four ministries
are relevant for the certification processes-- Ministry of
Environment (MoE), Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries (MAFF), Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport
and Tourism (MLIT), and Ministry of Education, Culture,
Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT)--which include
official contact point in Japan for activities of the UNESCO.
At local levels, the tourist associations lead some application
processes for MAB, while official education committees lead
the process in other contexts. There are tentative administra-
tive units, which shall be mainly in charge for the various
certificates, but these are still ongoing issues dependent on
certifications and individual local contexts (cf. Table 1).
The other uncertainty is related to the applications of the
certificates. The certification process and logos are utilized
in agricultural products, including vegetables, rice, or pro-
cessed sweets and wines in some cases. However, the rules
are not yet established and will require further elaborations.
Increase in prices of local products or surge of number of
tourists or educational programs are often common "indica-
tors" for obtaining the international certificates.
In short, the purpose and organizations of the individual
municipalities for applying for the international certifications
are more diverse and context dependent for the three systems
compared with the World Nature Heritage. For certain munic-
ipalities, the main purposes are the educational ones, whereas
for the others it is the tourism sector, with possible overlaps.
For certain certifications, the decision-making process
becomes highly complex because plural municipalities are
involved. For the first two designations of the GIAHS, the
Noto Peninsula had four cities and four towns involved,
whereas it was a single municipality for the Sado area. The
budget and advertising potential will be limited for the single
municipality, while the decision-making processes are often
faster and simpler.
To date, the existing literature tends to focus on case stud-
ies involving single municipalities with a single certification
scheme (Berglund etal., 2014; Lu & Li, 2006). For example,
Berglund et
al. (2014) conduct a comparative study of
GIAHS of Japan and Scandinavia. Hall (2006) and Mi etal.
(2014) focus on the policies related to the ecotourism of
GIAHS in their analyses.
Nakamura, Tsuge, Okubo, Takeuchi, and Nishikawa
(2014) and Yiu (2014) investigated the factors that influence
farmers, such as cost and actors problem in single area by the
system certification. Yet, the process of the certifications is
more complex and discursive. In this article, we examine four
certification systems consisting of both cases of single and
plural municipalities. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis
of the formal discussions at the municipality assemblies using
text-mining methods are limited and this study has potential
to contribute to the methodological discussions as well.

social science. Among others, Lukes (2005) named the offi-
cial discussions at the parliament as the first layer of power
among the three levels (the other two being the agenda set-
tings of "what comes into the agenda" and the last one was
related to consciousness of the public). The formal discus-
sions at the official settings are one of the simple and obvious
parameters, with certain limitations, of interests at certain
contexts. Recent studies have focused more on discourses or
governance and institutional settings at the policy implemen-
tations (Epstein, Bennett, Gruby, Acton, & Nenadovic, 2014;
Ostrom, 2008).
With these limitations and trends in mind, we analyze the
official discussions at the municipal assembly with quantita-
tive method. In addition, we further take into account another
source of information by interviewing officials with qualita-
tive method. As the first step, we analyzed formal discus-
sions of the municipal assembly at the local municipality
level based on the official record. We then interviewed the
officials in charge of the certification programs at the indi-
vidual municipalities. The interviews were structured, and
we asked the same questions to the officers.
Personal information including names, age, or gender was
not collected in the interviews. All of the municipalities and
officials in charge of the subject were informed that their
answers would be used for research. We contacted the offi-
cials by emails, and consent was obtained through exchange
of emails in writing. In case we had the chance to meet the
officials in person, we confirmed the consent orally.
By covering both official discussion and personal inter-
views, we aim to analyze the complex decision-making pro-
cess involving various municipalities, as we examine four
certification systems consisting of both cases of single and
plural municipalities. The concrete process of analysis is
described in the following sections.
Materials for Text Analysis
We collected the official records of municipal assemblies in
eight municipalities of the Noto Peninsula (Hakui, Nakanoto,
Nanao, Shika, Anamizu, Noto, and Suzu). These municipali-
ties were the initial members of the GIAHS, and we excluded
Houdatsu-Shimizu which joined the status later. We analyzed
Sado as a comparative case for the GIAHS case composed of
single entities near Noto Peninsula. For the MAB and
Geopark, we analyzed the assembly records of Hakusan City
of Ishikawa Prefecture and Ohno City of Fukui Prefecture.
Hakusan has been one of the initial members of MAB from
1980; moreover, Hakusan and Noto Peninsula are of the
same Ishikawa Prefecture. Ohno is the neighboring city of
Hakusan, and included in the MAB site of Hakusan region.
Yamanouchi, from Nagano, is analyzed as the case of
MAB. In contrast with Hakusan, Yamanouchi is a single
entity by MAB. As a matter of principle, we collected data
since 2011 when the GIAHS was first designated in Japan.
For Suzu and Yamanouchi, the recent data of 2012 and 2013
were analyzed, as they limit the public viewing period for
two years. For the other municipalities, we used the data
available from the official homepage (cf. Table 2).
In short, we analyzed GIAHS, MAB, and Geoparks com-
paring zones with single and plural municipalities. For
GIAHS, it was Noto (plural) and Sado (single); for MAB, it
was Hakusan (plural) and Yamanouchi (almost single); and
for Geopark, it was Hakusan (plural) and Yamanouchi (sin-
gle). In the strict sense, the Siga kogen consists of plural
municipalities including towns from Gunma Prefecture, but
it was obvious that the Yamanouchi was playing the main
role, so we regarded it as the single municipality. The certifi-
cation status is shown in Table 3. The overall size of the texts
data of the official records of municipal assembly was 11
million letters with 1.9 GB of data size.

Processing of the Relevant Terms
To focus our analysis, we limited the terms to GIAHS,
Ecopark (equivalent of the MAB in Japanese), and Geopark.
For the GIAHS-relevant municipalities of Noto and Sado,
we focused on questions and answers containing the term
Sekai-Nogyo-Isan (Japanese term for GIAHS) and GIAHS.
For Sado, we also included World Heritage or World Cultural
Heritage because Sado has expressed it is interested in
obtaining the status. Sado received its status as a Geopark in
2013, but we did not include the term because the keywords,
due to the low frequency of term expressed and data of
records, were limited. The term World Heritage was
expressed more frequently.
For MAB-related municipalities of Hakusan and
Yamanouchi, we focused on questions and answers contain-
ing the term Ecopark (the Japanese abbreviations for the
MAB). For Hakusan, we included the term Geopark and Geo
because it is designated as Geopark in addition to the MAB.
Methods of Text Analysis
We compare the frequently used terms in the discussion of
municipality assembly with the methods of co-occurrence
network and co-occurrence order. These results of quantita-
tive analysis of text mining are then compared with the
results of interviews. We adopted the Jaccard index for the
similarity coefficient. There are other indexes such as Cosine,
but we decided on Jaccard due to large size of the texts data
and the representation matrix was frequently sparse.
The definition is as follows:
Definition 1: (Jaccard index)
Jaccard index is a rational number between zero and one.
The Jaccard index of an arbitrary term X and term Y, J(X, Y)
can be calculated in the following formula:
J X Y A A B
, /
( ) = + +
( )
C
In this formula, A is the number where the terms X and Y
appear in the same text. B is the number of texts where the
term X appears alone, and C is the number of texts where Y
appears alone. The larger the J(X, Y), the more likely the two
terms appear simultaneously (i.e., they are coefficients). We
have utilized the software of kh-coder2.Beta31 for the
analysis.
Results
The results of frequently used terms for individual sites and
municipalities are listed in Table 4. It lists how frequently
individual systems of GIAHS, MAB, Geoparks, or World
Heritage are referred to during the period. The columns
where municipalities have no intentions for applying for the
certificates are indicated with a dash "". The parts with a
"" are not considered because they are not certified or are
not acting for obtaining the status.
We first examined the results of Noto and Sado from
GIAHS certification. As a general trend, the cities (Shi in
Japanese) tend to express sentences related to GIAHS more
frequently than the towns (Machi or Cho). The cities are

Suzu, Wajima, Nanao, and Hakui, and the towns being Noto,
Nakanoto, Shika, and Anamizu. The frequency was 13.65 for
the city and 3.6 per assembly session for individual towns. In
short, we identified the differences potentially by the size of
the municipalities. For municipalities at the GIAHS, the
larger cities such as Nanao, Suzu, and Wajima tended to
express the term more frequently than the towns or smaller
municipalities.
Besides the differences between the towns and cities men-
tioned above, the location of the municipalities had an influ-
ence. The municipalities of Suzu, Wajima, and Noto at the
northern territories, or the region of Okunoto, tended to
express the term GIAHS more frequently than the rest of the
municipalities. It is clear that there are discrepancies among
municipalities in Noto which are at the same GIAHS sites
depending on size and location. The cities with larger size
tend to express the terms more frequently than the towns.
Suzu, Wajima, and Noto in northern area tended to express
more frequently than Sika, Nanao, Nakanoto, and Hakui,
which are located in the middle or the south.
Sado expresses with less frequency compared with Noto
regions. This could be potentially related to the fact that Sado
aims to get registration as a World Natural Heritage. (We did
not include the frequency of Sado for the World Heritage as the
focus here is to compare the GIAHS of Sado with that of Noto).
Next we analyze the MAB with Hakusan andYamanouchi.
Hakusan has overlapping certification of the MAB and the
Geopark. The discussion at Hakusan is skewed toward
Geopark, with zero reference to the MAB and average per
assembly session of 33.7 references to the Geopark.
Hakusan runs the Geopark as a single entity being part of
the MAB among 11 other governing units, ranging from four
prefectures and seven municipalities. The similar contexts
are observed in other municipalities including Ohno in
Fukui. For example, the frequency of use the term, MAB is
low (0.1) in Ohno.
For the MAB comparison, we analyze the assemblies of
Hakusan and Yamanouchi. Hakusan has two certifications of
the MAB and Geopark, the frequency of the reference to the
MAB was zero and Geopark was 33.7 per assembly during
the period. The Geopark is run and organized by a single
entity, while MAB is run by plural entities (four prefectures
and seven villages). The Geopark was frequently referred to
in the assembly discussion. A similar trend is found for Ono
and the frequency of the reference was marginal with 0.1 per
assembly.
For Yamanouchi, the MAB has been referred to as much
as 23.8 per assembly. The frequency is obviously higher for
those municipalities with single or limited memberships,
possibly with more sense of ownership of the system.
Hakusan actually hosts the bureau (titled "Hakusan UNESCO
Ecopark Association" or Kyogikai in Japanese) of the MAB
with other municipalities, and hence we anticipated that
more discussions will be conducted. Ohno is a member of the
bureau, but it is not so active in the discussion.
Next we look into the discussion of the Geopark with
Hakusan and Itoigawa. They are both run by single munici-
pality. Both municipalities were active in the discussion
with the frequency of 33.7(Hakusan) and 95.7 (Itoigawa)
per assemblies.
Hakusan has been certified with the two systems, MAB
and Geopark (Geopark at the national level). Itoigawa has
been certified with the Geopark of global network. It was
less referred to in the Hakusan, but both municipalities have
actively discussed the certification.
Co-Occurrence Order
We choose Suzu for GIAHS, Yamanouchi for the MAB, and
Itoigawa for the Geopark for comparing the discussions with
different certifications. All the municipalities discussed rel-
evant issues relatively active in the assemblies. The Suzu
City was the first chair of the local GIAHS association and
played a central role in registration.
The relationships among municipalities are illustrated in
the Tables 5 to 7. We focused on "nouns" to identify the dis-
tance of different systems and regulations (the nouns include
name of places). Such limitations to nouns are common in
the existing literature (Capobianco, De Lucia, Oliveto,
Panichella, & Panichella, 2009). We identified the nouns that
will appear frequently together with the GIAHS, MAB, and
Geoparks.
We analyzed the distance of the certifying systems and
nouns such as conservation, exchange, educations, or tour-
isms. The hypothesis was the linkage of the assemblies' dis-
cussion and the trends at the sites. By examining the
hypothesis, we aimed to identify trends at the gap between
synergies of the activities on the ground and the discussions
at the political level.
The results are indicated in Figures 1 to 3. The thickness
of the circles around the terms signifies the frequency of the

terms expressed. The thickness of the lines signifies the fre-
quency of the two terms expressed together. The trends of the
discussions at the assemblies are visualized by Figures 1 to 3.
In general, in the discussions of the GIAHS at Suzu, the cer-
tification is discussed together with the terms agriculture and
conservation, while the term tourism is rather independent.
For the MAB at the Marunouchi, the certification is more
frequently expressed together with the terms tourism and
education, in comparison with the GIAHS. For Geopark at
Itoigawa, the term bullet train is expressed frequently
together as the new transportation system was planned to
start in March 2015 and stations were being constructed.
Such terms related to transportation were not expressed or
visible in the other contexts. Other terms such as agriculture
or conservations were not expressed in the contexts, which is
a difference compared with the other two certifications of
GIAHS and MAB.
Discussions
As a general trend, we identified the differences by the size
of the municipalities. For municipalities at the GIAHS, the
larger cities such as Nanao, Suzu, and Wajima tended to
express the term more frequently than the towns or smaller
municipalities. Furthermore, there were differences depend-
ing on the location of the municipalities, with Okunoto, the
municipalities in the northern area, being more actively
engaged in the discussions.
We have made comparative studies of different certifica-
tions within the same municipality. When the municipality
obtained a new or additional certification, the older certifica-
tion tended to get lower frequency for expressions. This was
the case for the MAB for the Hakusan, which obtained
Geopark in addition recently. For Sado, GIAHS was not so
actively discussed as the municipality aim to obtain the World
Cultural Heritage, and the latter was more frequently expressed
in the assembly. These trends question the sustainability of the
certified areas as the attention potentially decreases when the
municipality obtains or aims to obtain new certifications.
Certain awareness raising and measures are necessary to buf-
fer the decrease in the interests of the existing certifications
when obtaining or initiating new certifications.
For the comparison of the three certifications of the
GIAHS at Suzu, MAB at Yamanouchi, and Geopark at
Itoigawa, the Geopark was most frequently expressed. The
comparison is by no means representative of each certifica-
tion, and it is not possible to compare the average or statis-
tics. The possible cause is that both Hakusan and Itoigawa
run the Geopark as single entity, and thus the discussions at
the assembly was more active, resulting in such higher fre-
quency for expressions. Another factor for Itoigawa was the
new transportation system of bullet train.
As for the content of the discussion at the assemblies, the
term GIAHS was used frequently together with certification
and conservation.
For Yamanouchi and Itoigawa, the name of the certificate
MAB and Geopark was expressed frequently together with
the terms tourism, education, and utilization. The term brand
was expressed for the GIAHS and Ecopark, which was not
the case for the Geopark at Itoigawa.

From the figure of the co-occurrence order for the Geopark
at Itoigawa (Figure 3), concrete issues such as bullet trains,
number of non-residential visitors (or Koryu Jiko in
Japanese), and enterprises were expressed together in the
same texts. For Suzu, the terms collaboration, tourism, and
utilization were expressed separately from the texts of the
GIAHS. For Yamanouchi, the term Ecopark was expressed
together with education, whereas industry, brand, and agri-
cultures were expressed separately.
Based on these discussions with limited number of
municipalities, we illustrated the characteristics of the
certifications systems. For example, Geopark at Itoigawa
was expressed frequently with the transportation and visi-
tors, which was strongly influenced with the construction
of the new bullet train systems to be completed in March
2015.
For the discussions at the GIAHS at Suzu, term GIAHS was
used frequently together with certification and conservation.
The terms Satoyama and Satoumi, which means the social and
cultural production landscapes and seascapes, were loosely
interlinked with nature and brands. Though not direct, the col-
laboration with the university and human resource develop-
ment systems were also frequently expressed together as
characteristics of the region. For Yamanouchi with the MAB,
the linkage with the tourism was strong. Other associated terms
were brands, agricultures, and other national-level plans and
assemblies.
These illustrations are by no means representations of each
certification. Yet we can cautiously suggest that the discus-
sions are embedded in the individual contexts. By compiling
such quantitative analysis at the local-level assemblies, the
finding suggests the micro-level focus of the certifications.

There are several findings with policy implications. We
identified certain pitfalls, that the municipalities tended to
focus their discussions on newer certifications and interests
for the existing ones tend to decrease. In future studies, it is
possible to identify and even partially quantify the political
focus and interests of the certifications at different political
levels by comparing the different layers of municipalities,
prefectures or national assemblies.
For methodology, we have demonstrated that the text-
mining methods can be applied to the discussions at the offi-
cial records of municipality assemblies and showed the
rough focus and possible trends of the discussions at the
political level, given the availability of official records online
even for limited number of years.
The application must be done in a careful manner and
individual contexts need to be taken into consideration. For
some municipalities, the main discussion may be happening
outside of the official assemblies with local NGOs or research
groups.
Conclusion
The focus of this study was rather limited with emphasis on
official records at the municipality diet from 2011 to 2013.
Yet, even with these focused materials with specific time
frame, the results of the study indicate the context-specific
characteristics of the biodiversity relevant to certification
schemes. The terms were largely in the field of conservation,
education, or agriculture-related terms. There were less
focuses on economic terms such as income and employment
in the discussions.

The lack of economic terms is critical, as the immediate
expectations from the local communities are economic in
nature from the experiences of the authors when visiting
these areas. As Bowitz and Ibenholt (2009) illustrated, posi-
tive impacts are reported in increase in employment and
incomes in case of UNESCO World Cultural Heritage.
Whether such impacts are observed in shorter or longer terms
remains to be seen for the schemes in this study, the UNESCO
Geoparks, MAB, and GIAHS. These schemes are not pri-
marily designed for economic purposes yet the expectations
of the local communities are frequently different and expect
economic outcomes. These are complex issues linked with
sustainability of the overall scheme.
To pursue these explorations, it is necessary to explore
additional materials to the official records at the municipality
diet. The data and statistics of the economic impact will need
to be examined. Furthermore, the methodology of this article
can be applied in larger contexts, to examine the multi-dimen-
sion of the certification to the local and surrounding commu-
nities. Additional materials for text-mining analysis can be
outcomes of group discussions, remarks in Social Networking
Service (SNS), or advertisements of the designated places.

It is also necessary to follow up the results with longer
time frame beyond the year 2013, with a sequel involving
pertinent international data and appropriate comparisons and
analyses as the study indicates the results from relatively
new periods since the introduction of the system in Japan.
