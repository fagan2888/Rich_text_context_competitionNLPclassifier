Not long ago, health care providers rarely interacted with
children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD1; American
Psychiatric Association, 2013; Grinkler, 2007). Until the last
decade or so, some family physicians reported never having
a patient with ASD. This situation has changed (Lantos,
2007). Although a vigorous debate continues as to whether
or not the prevalence of ASD has genuinely risen, the rate at
which children are diagnosed with ASD has grown substan-
tially in the last 20 years (Saracino, Noseworthy, Steiman,
Reisinger, & Fombonne, 2010). Whereas ASD was once
expected to affect about 1 in every 10,000 children, in the
post-millennial world, ASD occurs in somewhere between 1
in 500 children (Fombonne, 2009) to 1 in 68 children
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). Having
a health care practice not including a patient with ASD is
becoming increasingly unusual.
Even so, health care infrastructures incompletely include
individuals with ASD. Many individuals with disabilities,
including those with neurological differences, report unusual
difficulty accessing services (e.g., Chiri & Warfield, 2012;
Warfield & Gulley, 2006) and interacting with health care
professionals (Callahan & Cooper, 2006; Smith, 2008). Part
of these difficulties arose from a history of expansive social
discrimination against individuals with disabilities including
often unnecessary institutionalization. Disability activists
have at times attributed social exclusion of individuals with
disabilities to the "medical model" of disability (Shakespeare,
2008). This characterization is connected to both historical
and ongoing experiences of individuals with disabilities in
their interactions with members of the medical community.

Policy Awareness, Financial Hardship,
and Work Impact: Correlates of Negative
Experiences With Health Care Providers
and Health Care Insurers Among
Caregivers of Children With Autism
Spectrum Disorder
Laurie A. Drapela1 and Dana Lee Baker2
Abstract
Individuals with disabilities often report difficulty interacting with health care professionals. Addressing this challenge requires
greater understanding of factors that exacerbate the odds of negative interactions between health care providers and patients
with disabilities. Drawing on the qualitative research describing the features of such incidents, we use logistic regression to
explore two dimensions of this dynamic: negative experiences with health care providers (e.g., doctors, specialists) and
negative experiences with health insurance carriers (e.g., for profit or non-profit health insurance organizations). Using a
non-probability sample of American families who have a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we find that negative
experiences with health care providers are associated with the family's income level, as well as changes in parental labor
force participation. The odds of a negative interaction with the insurance carrier are intensified when the family experiences
financial difficulties and when they have a negative experience with the health care provider. Finally, families who are aware
of laws and policies regarding ASD also report increased odds of negative experiences with their insurance carrier but not
their health care provider. Policy implications of our findings are discussed.

However, it also ignores more positive experiences and pro-
ductive relationships. Use of the phrase "medical model" as
a derogatory term can create both the impression and actual
existence of hostility toward all health care providers.
Regardless of the motivation for alienation, creating more
effective health care policy and practice for persons with
ASD requires a better understanding of factors increasing the
likelihood of a negative interaction between those working
in the health care system and individuals with disabilities.
This article explores the factors affecting the negative expe-
riences of families with children who have ASD, their health
care providers, and their health care insurers.
We focus on health care providers and health care insurers
separately because many parents are seeking services for
their child with ASD in a private health care market, where
they are tasked with working with their child's physician or
other direct-service providers to obtain services that will
assist the child as well as interacting with the insurance car-
rier to ensure that the services recommended by the pediatri-
cian will be covered by the family's health plan. As such, we
define "health care providers" as medically trained personnel
who provide direct-service medical care to patients with
ASD (e.g., doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, etc.).
These providers are distinct from the individuals working in
health insurance companies, who disburse funds to said
patients (and their families) to cover the costs of these ser-
vices (hereafter referred to as "health insurance carriers").
The intensity of parents' experiences with these policy
subsystems may result in conflict or other challenging inter-
actions as they negotiate caring for a child with ASD. While
several analyses have carefully studied how parents of chil-
dren with ASD are treated by individuals working in the
health care system (Gray, 1993; Hutton & Caron, 2005;
Ryan & Cole, 2008) and how they engage treatment options
offered by their health care providers (Valentine, 2010), the
role of a critical player in care for persons with ASD--the
health insurance carrier--is largely absent from scholarly
study of parent care for children with ASD. This distinction
is not a minor one. In private health care settings, providers
may advocate parents to pursue oneASD treatment approach
for which their health care insurer refuses to provide finan-
cial coverage. As such, we investigate whether the factors
associated with a negative health care experience among
families caring for a child with ASD are unique to each
entity. In our study, we answer three primary research
questions:
Research Question 1: What, if any, are the correlates of
negative experiences between caregivers of a child with
ASD and their health care providers?
Research Question 2: What, if any, are the correlates of
negative experiences between caregivers of a child with
ASD and their health insurance carriers?
Research Question 3: Do they overlap? These analyses
will shed light on potential changes to practice and to
health care policy, which could result in improved interac-
tions between individuals with disabilities and health care
systems.
Background
Providing Care for Individuals With ASD
Patients with ASD can present unusual challenges for health
care providers (Gurney, McPheeters, & Davis, 2006; Meyers
& Johnson, 2007). The highly variable nature of this neuro-
logical difference among individuals can challenge physi-
cians'abilities to make an accurate diagnosis of the condition.
In addition, prognoses for children diagnosed with ASD are
also unreliable (Matson & Smith, 2008). In the past, the vast
majority of children diagnosed with ASD became adults
who, if not institutionalized, were almost certainly depen-
dent on their families of origin and social welfare programs
(Gray, 1993, 1994). However, public policies and discrimi-
natory social attitudes contributed heavily to these outcomes.
While observed and expected improvement in overall out-
comes for children with ASD is desirable, managing such
uncertainty can complicate relationships between health care
providers, health care insurers, and their families.
Furthermore, scientific questions surrounding ASD have
become increasingly politically divisive in recent decades
(Murray, 2012). Partially owing to suspicion of a causal rela-
tionship between childhood vaccines and ASD and increased
dependence on the Internet for medical information, oppor-
tunities for spread of mistrust between caregivers and health
care providers have expanded ( Baker, 2008; Offit, 2010;
Parikh, 2008). In addition, untested (or less than thoroughly
proven) interventions forASD are increasingly prevalent and
popular, creating an additional challenge for health care pro-
viders to help patients and their family members evaluate the
potential benefits of treatment options given scientific
uncertainty.
Disability and Health Care
Aside from these diagnostic challenges, the nature of profes-
sional training in the health care field can also serve as a
source of strain for patients with ASD and their families
(Carbone et al., 2013; Liptak et al., 2006; Rhoades, Scarpa,
& Salley, 2007). Health care education generally focuses on
deviance from norms. In other words, an important aspect of
learning to practice medicine is exposure to human atypicali-
ties (Shapiro, 2008). Both issue stakeholders and disability
studies scholars have expressed concern that this mode of
medical education, while certainly efficient and effective
from the standpoint of student exposure to human variability,
overemphasizes deficits even when conditions are not asso-
ciated with declining functionality (Baker, 2011; Leiter,
2007). A result of this overemphasis on deficits can be the
so-called medical model of disability wherein the essence of
Drapela and Baker 3
the individual becomes defined exclusively in terms of their
disability (Murray, 2012).
This model of disability is unfavorably contrasted with
the social construction model employed in disability studies
literature. Scholars using the social model of disability frame
the challenges associated with it as predominantly resulting
from discriminatory social infrastructures. Although real-
world proponents of the medical model are virtually absent
from modern Western democracies (Shakespeare, 2008), dis-
ability scholars and activists continue to express concern that
particularly within the health care community there exists a
subconscious tendency to revert to such essentialist thinking
about disability ( Baker, 2011; Grinkler, 2007).
The Parent as Case Manager for a Child With
ASD
Children are increasingly diagnosed with ASD during early
childhood, rather than later in life (Hutton & Caron, 2005;
Ryan & Cole, 2008). During this stage of life, they are depen-
dent upon parents for all of their care; this is particularly so
for children who have ASD (Bayat, 2007; Gray, 1994, 2002).
Parents find themselves as a critical source of support and
advocacy for the child's treatment, yet they may have little to
no formal knowledge or education of the complexities inher-
ent in this neurological condition (Tomes, 2007; Valentine,
2010). This lack of knowledge is very stressful for parents
who often feel disempowered by the health care systems they
must rely on to assist their child or children withASD (Hutton
& Caron, 2005; Ryan & Cole, 2008; Valentine, 2010).
Prior research has shown that some of these parents report
negative health experiences, expressing feelings of shock
and disbelief at their abrupt treatment by clinical staff
(Hutton & Caron, 2005; Todd & Jones, 2003). These nega-
tive experiences appear to be heightened by parents'difficul-
ties accessing services for their child (Hutton & Caron,
2005). Some parents report feeling so upset and disempow-
ered that they become an activist for children with disabili-
ties (Ryan & Cole, 2008). Social activism is one way in
which parents have empowered themselves as stakeholders
in the care for their children with ASD, which has led to
improvedcare.Forexample,theDisabilityRightsMovement,
which began in the United States during the 1970s, was a
very influential force in eliminating the practice of institu-
tionalization of individuals withASD (Ward & Meyer, 1999).
Social activism was also responsible for integrating individ-
uals with disabilities into the American public school system
(Leiter, 2004a). Both these examples illustrate the power of
social activism to change disability policy among publicly
funded institutions in the United States.
Parents--especially mothers--play a vital role in that
activism because they are often case managers of their child's
care for ASD (Baker & Drapela, 2010; Hutton & Caron,
2005; Leiter, 2004b; Ryan & Cole, 2008; Todd & Jones,
2003). Because the American health care system is largely
privatized, case management activities usually involve coor-
dinating the child's needs with both the health care provider
and the health insurance carrier. These two entities some-
times have diverse interests in the management of patient
care, with the former being geared toward treatment and the
latter toward assessing coverage and rationing availability of
treatment services. As such, we consider them separately in
our study of negative health experiences among families car-
ing for a child or children with ASD. To date, research in this
area has been based on qualitative methods that explored
parents' perceptions, coping, and activism responses around
their child or children's ASD (Gray, 1993; Hutton & Caron,
2005; Ryan & Cole, 2008; Todd & Jones, 2003; Valentine,
2010). In this study, we build upon that literature by examin-
ing quantitatively how individual family characteristics,
experiences with and awareness of services for children with
ASD, and parental labor force participation are associated
with the odds of negative experiences with health care pro-
viders and health care insurers among families caring for
children with ASD.
We explore four areas of family life that may be associ-
ated with negative experiences among parents caring for a
child with ASD, their health care providers, and/or their
health insurance carriers: (a) household/family characteris-
tics, (b) family awareness of laws and/or policies regarding
ASD, (c) the family's type of health care coverage, and (d)
parental work issues. While the correlates of conflict with
health care systems may be infinite, we focus our attentions
on these four areas because of their relevance to the ASD
literature.
Correlates of Negative Experiences: Family
Characteristics, Policy Awareness, Health Care,
and Parental Work Indicators
Household/family characteristics.Parents' accessing health
care services for their children can be complicated, particu-
larly if they are parenting more than one child with ASD
(Kuhn & Carter, 2010) or balancing the needs of a child with
ASD with those of a neurotypical sibling or siblings (Chiri &
Warfield, 2012; Gray, 2002). Due to the presence of these
stressful conditions in their lives, we would expect that the
greater the number of children in the family, the greater the
odds of having a negative experience with the child's health
care provider and/or the family's health care insurer. Fami-
lies who have more than one member affected by ASD may
also exhibit greater levels of conflict with health care provid-
ers and/or health care insurers, due to the stress of coordinat-
ing for multiple-affected individuals. In addition, families
who live in either outlying suburban areas or rural areas may
encounter difficulty in commuting to treatment sites for their
child or children with ASD (Gray, 1994; Hutton & Caron,
2005). These challenges could enhance the odds of having a
4 SAGE Open
negative experience with either the doctor, if the physician(s)
are not willing to have flexible schedules to accommodate
the rural families' additional commuting time; or the health
care insurer, due to insurer's unwillingness to pay for out-of-
plan services that may be closer to the family's rural com-
munity. Finally, there is some evidence to suggest that
individuals in upper-income families are more likely to chal-
lenge physicians during the course of office consultations
with them (e.g., Haug & Lavin, 1981, 1983), and there is
evidence that they are more willing to file malpractice law-
suits than lower-income families (e.g., Mullis, 1995). As
such, we expect household income to be positively associ-
ated with having a negative experience with health care pro-
viders and/or health care insurers.
Awareness of autism-related policies and programs.Policies
and programs focusing on the interests of individuals with
disabilities and their families generally seek to create condi-
tions that enhance their participation in society (Dalton,
2008; Offit, 2010). They also serve to raise parents' aware-
ness of the kinds of services their child or children with ASD
should be receiving (Ryan & Cole, 2008). Furthermore, such
political engagement contributes to a rights-based under-
standing of disability typically involving a sense of outrage
when individuals with disability receive disparate treatment
(Leiter, 2004a). Such consciousness-raising efforts may
increase the odds of parental conflict with a health care pro-
vider and/or a health insurance carrier, if the health care
organization does not offer services for ASD patients or
restricts health care services for children with ASD to only
the most severely affected.
Health care coverage. Parents can encounter difficulties when
accessing health care services for their children with disabili-
ties (Warfield & Gulley, 2006). Parents of children with ASD
tend to have higher rates of unmet health care needs than either
the general population of children in the United States (Strick-
land, Jones, Ghandour, Kogan, & Newacheck, 2011) or fami-
lies caring for children with other types of disabilities (Chiri &
Warfield, 2012; Kogan et al., 2008; Vohra, Madhavan, Sam-
bamoorthi, & St. Peter, 2013). Families caring for a child (or
children) with ASD also report lower rates of satisfaction with
their pediatrician, relative to families caring for children with
other types of disabilities (Liptak et al., 2006). Some families
qualify for Medicaid, a publicly funded health care program,
and still other families go without health care altogether
because they have no access to the private market through
their employer and do not qualify for publicly funded health
care (Chiri & Warfield, 2012). Because health care services in
the United States are frequently delivered to families through
private or not-for-profit corporations, insurance carriers may
refuse services to a patient with ASD because it is believed to
be not cost-effective for the health care organization.
Covered access to clinicians who can treat a child with
ASD often depends upon referral from the child's
pediatrician. A child's primary care physician may not be
convinced of the possibility of a neurological difference in
the patient, and therefore may fail, or even directly refuse to
refer them for assessments by specialists (Carbone et al.,
2013; Gray, 1994). While such a circumstance may be linked
to greater odds of a negative experience with a child's health
care provider for families carrying either type of health insur-
ance, families with Medicaid may be at a higher relative risk
for two reasons: (a) The demand for such services far exceeds
the capacity of the public health care system to aid all who
need it, and thus the doctor is a gatekeeper for access to pub-
licly funded services; and (b) obtaining services on the pri-
vate market is not usually an option for families on Medicaid
(e.g., Ghandour, Hirai, Blumberg, Strickland, & Kogan,
2014). Thus, the odds of having a negative health experience
with the child's health care provider(s) are expected to be
greater for families with Medicaid.
Parental work issues. Finally, we considered whether parents
made changes to their work lives, due to a child (or chil-
dren's) ASD (e.g., Baker & Drapela, 2010; Gordon, Rosen-
man, & Cuskelly, 2007; Stoner & Stoner, 2014), and if that
change affects their chances of having negative experiences
with their child's doctor and/or the family's health insurance
carrier. These changes in family work may indirectly affect
health care experiences among families caring for children
with ASD if financial burdens result from a parent's changed
(or reduced) work schedules.
These four areas of family life form the bases of our
exploratory analyses that will answer the aforementioned
research questions.
Method
Data for this analysis were collected using a survey titled
"Autism, Health Care, and Public Policy: Experiences of
Families with Health Care Systems." We used a cross-sec-
tional study design and disseminated our survey in
Washington and Oregon between the months of October
2006 and May 2007. The survey was modeled after the
"Participation and Activities Limitation Survey" created by
Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2006). Versions of the
survey have previously been used to examine the experi-
ences of families with children with ASD in Missouri and
British Columbia (e.g., Baker, 2009; Baker & Drapela, 2010;
Baker & Keiser, 2008; Baker & Meers, 2005; Sharpe &
Baker, 2007). The survey consists of 58 questions posed in a
variety of forms, including close-ended, multiple choice,
Likert-type scale, and open-ended questions that address
seven areas: demographics and socioeconomic characteris-
tics; family history with ASD; education, treatment, and
interventions; ASD awareness and information; experiences
with health care providers; access to health care; and general
impressions of the health care system. The survey is designed
to take approximately 45 min to complete.
Drapela and Baker 5
Prevalence figures for ASD have varied considerably
over the years, with Centers for Disease Control surveillance
studies estimating its expression anywhere from 1 child per
150 children aged 8 or below (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, 2007) to 1 in 88 children (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2012), and, most recently, to 1 in 68
children (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014).
While the factors associated with the increasing prevalence
are a combination of increased ASD awareness and broad-
ened diagnostic criteria (see Saracino et al., 2010), even the
highest prevalence rate above would be cost-prohibitive for
using probability sampling methods (e.g., to obtain a sample
of 100 would have required a sample of at least 8,800
families).
Importantly, we chose a convenience sampling strategy
because it allowed us direct access to families caring for
children with ASD. Even if we had the funds for a large-
scale probability sample, we were still not assured of find-
ing enough families caring for a child with ASD who were
willing to answer our survey questions about their negative
experiences with providers and insurers. For example, fami-
lies caring for children with special needs who are receiving
services through a "medical home" arrangement--where
the health care provider coordinates general and specialty
medical care and ensures that services are delivered on a
routine basis--may not have negative experiences with
either the provider or the insurer, but may have ended up in
a large-scale probability sample (e.g., Strickland et al.,
2011). Using a convenience sampling strategy allows us the
most cost-efficient way to find a sample that has recent
experience with the kinds of health care experiences that are
the focus of study.
Local leaders in the area of ASD were identified using a
comprehensive list of allASD-oriented groups in Washington
and Oregon, and through reviewing articles in the local press
and records of appearances at local stakeholders meetings.
Leaders in these organizations publicized the study by post-
ing advertising flyers around their offices and announcing
the study at their regular meetings. They also publicized an
Internet link that potential respondents could use to read
about the study and answer the survey. No additional efforts
were undertaken by the researchers to recruit members of
underrepresented groups.
All respondents completed the survey online (although
paper copies were available, no one elected to complete
paper copies). Caregivers were asked to provide their
informed consent to participate, and instructions indicated
that they could refuse to answer any question without pen-
alty. Respondents were allowed to complete the survey only
once, though they were allowed multiple visits to the site to
complete the instrument. Respondents with more than one
child with ASD were asked to complete the survey from the
perspective of their experiences with their child who was
first diagnosed with ASD (as opposed to the oldest child with
ASD since often an older sibling is diagnosed later than a
younger one if the younger child exhibits more behaviors
associated with ASD). The website recorded 563 visits,
yielding 326 surveys. Of those 326 surveys, 215 contained
complete data for the variables used in the study. As such, we
are using 66% of the completed forms in our analyses.2
Variables
Dependent variables. Survey respondents were asked whether
or not they, or their child, had ever had a negative experience
with the child's health care provider, operationally defined
as a doctor, nurse, occupational therapist, or other direct-
service care provider. Survey respondents were also asked
whether they had a negative experience with their health
insurance carrier, which we have operationalized as the guar-
antor of the child's health care services. Both questions spe-
cifically asked the respondent to consider these negative
experiences as a result of their child or children's ASD. Both
items on the survey had dichotomous response categories,
requiring the respondent to answer "yes" or "no."
Predictor variables. As previously mentioned, negative health
experiences may be associated with both personal and house-
hold/family characteristics of parents caring for a child or
children with ASD. Four categories of factors related to
interactions with health care providers and insurers identi-
fied in the literature were included in the study: household/
family characteristics, the respondent's awareness of policies
and services for ASD, health care coverage (access to health
care insurance), and parental work issues associated with
ASD.
In terms of family characteristics, we asked respondents
to list the number of children who were currently living in
the home with them, whether or not they lived in a rural area
(1 = yes, 0 = otherwise), whether their child with ASD was
male or female (1 = male), and whether there were other per-
sons in the family with ASD (1 = no one, 0 = otherwise). We
measured total family income for 2005 ordinally, with the
following categories: US$20,000 or less; between US$20,001
and US$60,000; US$60,001- US$90,000; and US$90,001-
US$160,000. Thus, a one-unit increase for this variable will
represent a potentially substantial increase in annual house-
hold income (from US$20,000 or less to US$60,000).
We measured two dimensions of policy awareness:
whether the respondent currently felt that the family had an
unmet need for ASD services (1 = yes, 0 = otherwise) and
whether they were aware of public policies and laws related
to ASD. We originally scaled this variable in an ordinal fash-
ion (1 = no awareness to 4 = total awareness), but it was so
highly skewed that we dichotomized it, collapsing the "very
aware, aware, somewhat aware" categories into "awareness"
and 0 = all else.
Access to medical care was measured in two ways:
whether or not the family paid for their child (or children's)
medical care with Medicaid or whether they used private
6 SAGE Open
insurance. We did not ask our respondents whether they
used both types of insurance; our measure represents the
predominant method of payment for health care used by
the family. We asked our respondents whether they used
their own personal funds to provide services for their child
(or children) with ASD, but due to a high level of missing
data for this question, we dropped this measure from our
analyses. To be consistent with the literature on health care
and ASD, we used a dichotomous measure for medical
care through publicly funded insurance (Medicaid: 1 = yes,
0 = all other). The reference category for these individuals
are those using private insurance; thus, we can still mea-
sure the effects of private and public insurance on conflicts
with health care providers and health insurance
companies.
We asked families about any changes they had taken in
their work lives, due to their child (or children's) ASD.
Specifically, we asked respondents whether they had experi-
enced financial problems during the past year, due to their
child's ASD (1 = yes, 0 = no, not sure); whether they had not
taken a job, due to their child's ASD (1 = yes, 0 = no);
whether they had not taken a promotion, due to their child's
ASD (1 = yes, 0 = no); and whether they had chosen to work
fewer hours, due to their child's ASD (1 = yes, 0 = no). These
questions are consistent with the types of indicators used to
measure the financial burdens associated with providing
health care to a child (or children) withASD, per the National
Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs
(NS-CSHCN; for example, Ghandour et al., 2014; Kogan et
al., 2008).
Analytical Approach
Logistic regression was employed to model the odds of fami-
lies having a negative experience with either their health care
provider or their health insurance carrier. In logistic regres-
sion, the primary analytical goal is to predict the odds of a
dichotomous outcome, controlling for a set of conditions
(covariates). Logistic regression allows for modeling of how
factors are either positively or negatively related to the odds
of a negative health experience attributed by the parent or
primary caregiver to the child's ASD, while controlling for
other covariates. Effect sizes are expressed in odds ratios
(ORs), or the ratio of the odds of a negative experience of
one level of a covariate to the odds of a negative experience
of another level of the covariate. The predictor variables
were entered into our logistic regression models in thematic
groups. Household characteristics were the first set of vari-
ables, followed by policies and services for ASD, then
Medicaid use, and parent work variables. Our use of collin-
earity diagnostics did not indicate the presence of multi-col-
linearity among our independent variables. Results are
discussed in terms of their odds on the respondents'reporting
negative experiences with the child's doctor and/or the fam-
ily's insurance carrier.
Results
Descriptive Statistics
As shown in Table 1, more than half of our sample reported
having a negative experience during the past year with their
child's health care provider, due to the child's ASD (58%),
and more than two thirds of respondents had a negative expe-
rience with their health insurance carrier, due to the child's
ASD (69%; Table 1).
These differing percentages are consistent with our argu-
ment that families who are caring for a child (or children)
with ASD make conceptual distinctions between their
child's health care provider and their health insurance car-
rier. Moreover, a greater proportion of the families in the
sample had a negative health care experience with their
insurer, relative to their direct-service health care provider
(i.e., doctor).
Nineteen percent (19%) of the families in our sample
report living in a rural area, a proportion that is very similar
to the 2010 U.S. Census figure of 19.3% (U.S. Census
Bureau, 2010a). The average number of children among
households in our sample is 1.82 (Table 1), a number slightly
less than the national average of 1.88 for the closest census
year to 2006 (see U.S. Census Bureau, 2010b). Eighty-two
percent (82%) of respondents self-report that their answers to
our survey questions were specifically about their sons. The
male preponderance of ASD-affected individuals in this
sample is consistent with the gender prevalence of this neu-
rological difference in general population surveillance stud-
ies (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012).
Almost two thirds of the respondents in our survey indicated
that they did not have anyone else in the family with ASD
(Table 1), a percentage that is slightly lower than a multi-
state study of children with special health care needs asking
a comparable question (77%; see Warfield & Gulley, 2006).
The sample's average annual household income value was
between US$60,001 and US$90,000 per year (or the third
category of our four income groups). This broad range
encompasses household incomes that are higher than the
median household income for the United States in 2006--
US$48,851 (Webster & Bishaw, 2007).
The majority of our respondents described themselves as
well aware of the policies and services for ASD (86%), and
75% of them stated that they had an unmet service need
related to ASD (Table 1). These percentages are a bit higher
than the percentages derived from multi-state surveys of par-
ents who have children with special health care needs. Unmet
needs in these studies range from 4% (Chiri & Warfield,
2012) to 12% (Warfield & Gulley, 2006). One possible rea-
son for these discrepancies entails the recruitment strategy
for our study. We used a convenience sampling strategy
where we contacted local leaders in the ASD outreach and
advocacy community in Washington and Oregon who publi-
cized our study to persons who were caring for a child with
autism. This strategy may be one reason why the prevalence
Drapela and Baker 7
of unmet health care needs for a child with ASD is higher in
our sample than in studies of health care needs for children
with disabilities using larger samples collected with proba-
bility sampling designs.
Twenty-seven percent (27%) of the families in our sample
are using Medicaid exclusively for their health insurance car-
rier, a proportion that is slightly higher than the national rate
of 21% (Table 1; Kaiser Family Foundation, n.d.). Given that
families in our sample who are carrying private insurance
serve as the reference category for insurance type, there will
be ample opportunities for us to explore whether the odds of
a negative experience with the health care provider versus
the health care insurer will be distinct for those using
Medicaid, versus those using private insurance.
Parental work issues affected several of the families in
our sample (Table 1). Fifty-eight percent (58%) of respon-
dents indicated that they had not taken a job, due to their
child's ASD; 57% noted that they had encountered finan-
cial problems, due to their child's ASD; and 53% of fami-
lies reported that someone in the family had worked fewer
hours, due to their child's ASD. Around one quarter of the
sample (23%) had not taken a promotion, due to the child's
ASD, and another 19% had changed jobs for the same rea-
son (Table 1). Corresponding items from the 2005 to 2006
round of the NS-CSHCN showed that 57% of a multi-state
sample of families with children with ASD reduced or
stopped working, due to the child's condition. Financial
problems were experienced by 40% of this sample (Kogan
et al., 2008).
Recall from our earlier discussion that we will explore
these correlates of conflict between families and the health
care system separately for health care providers and health
care insurance companies. We focus on these entities sepa-
rately because many parents are seeking services for their
child with ASD in a private health care market, where they
are tasked with working with their child's pediatrician to
obtain services that will assist the child, as well as interacting
with the insurance carrier to ensure that the services recom-
mended by the pediatrician will be covered by the family's
health plan.
Negative Experiences With the Child's Health
Care Provider
We used logistic regression to estimate the odds of having a
negative experience with the child's health care provider on
the 13 covariates (Table 2). In all, 4 of the 13 predictor vari-
ables significantly affected the odds of a family having a
negative experience with the child's doctor, due to the child's
ASD: rural residence, household income, not taking a job
due to the child's ASD, and not taking a promotion due to the
child's ASD. These four variables have positive coefficients,
meaning that they significantly increased the odds of having
conflict with a health care provider.

Living in a rural area more than doubles the odds of con-
flict with a direct-service health care provider, all else being
equal (Table 2; OR = 2.31, p < .05), a finding that is in the
direction we expected. A one-unit increase in the family's
income level (i.e., moving to the next group in our grouped
income variable) increases the odds of having a negative
experience with the child's doctor by more than 70%, all
other factors held constant (Table 2; OR = 1.73, p < .05).
Our finding that persons from higher-income households
had significantly greater odds of having a negative health
care experience is consistent with our hypothesis that upper-
level income individuals would be more likely to challenge
doctors than lower-income individuals (e.g., Haug & Lavin,
1983).
Parental work issues also affected the odds of conflict with
a child's health care provider. If a parent did not take a job,
due to the child's ASD, the odds of conflict with a health care
provider doubles (Table 2; OR = 2.13, p < .05), all else being
equal. If a parent did not take a promotion, due to the child's
ASD, the odds of conflict more than doubled (Table 2; OR =
2.43, p < .05). These items are consistent with an interpreta-
tion of family financial strains created by ASD; however,
three other variables that also measured financial strains were
not statistically significant (e.g., financial problems, parent
changed jobs, and parent worked fewer hours--all due to
child's ASD). Rather, it may be the case that these two ques-
tions are measuring some dimension of parent frustration at
being either unemployed or underemployed, and it is having
impact on the interactions with the child's health care pro-
vider (although we do not have those measures in our data).
The coefficients for families' levels of awareness of laws
and policies regarding ASD and the families' unmet needs
for ASD were both positive, meaning that they increased the
odds of having a negative health experience with their chil-
dren's health care provider. These findings were consistent
with our earlier-stated predictions; however, these coeffi-
cients were not statistically significant. These two results--
the latter in particular--were somewhat surprising, given
that families with children who have ASD experience high
levels of unmet needs for health care (Chiri & Warfield,
2012; Kogan et al., 2008). Similarly, respondents who were
on Medicaid had a higher odds of a negative health experi-
ence with the child's provider (OR = 1.40), but this coeffi-
cient failed to reach statistical significance as well. Despite
these non-significant predictor variables, the model in Table
2 explains 18% of the variance in the odds of having a nega-
tive health care experience with the child's health care pro-
vider (Nagelkerke R2 = .18, 2 = 29.97, p < .01).
Negative Experiences With the Child's Health
Insurance Carrier
We also used logistic regression to estimate the odds of hav-
ing a negative experience with the child's health insurance
carrier on the 13 covariates (Table 3). Only 3 of the 13 pre-
dictor variables significantly affected the odds of having a
negative experience with the family's health insurance car-
rier: being aware of laws and policies regarding ASD; expe-
riencing financial problems, due to the child's ASD; and
having a negative experience with the child's health care pro-
vider (also due to the child's ASD).
If a respondent self-reported that he or she had an aware-
ness of laws and policies regarding ASD, his or her odds of
experiencing a negative experience with the health care

insurer was almost three and one half times greater than
persons who did not report such an awareness, all other fac-
tors held constant (Table 3; OR = 3.46, p < .001). Such
awareness was associated with increased tensions between
the respondents and their insurance carriers, net of the type
of insurance the families were using at the time they com-
pleted the survey. (Recall that "Medicare" is dichotomized
to include persons with all other types of insurance as the
reference category--thus, families who are carrying insur-
ance of any kind are represented in the regression equa-
tion.) As previously mentioned, financial problems were
also a factor that significantly increased odds of a negative
experience with the child's health care insurer (Table 3).
Families reporting that they had encountered financial
problems due to their child's ASD had four times higher
odds of a negative experience with their health insurance
carrier than those families who did not have financial prob-
lems, all else being equal (OR = 4.19, p < .001). These find-
ings are consistent with the expectation that parents'
difficulty gaining access to services for their child with
ASD would negatively affect their relationship with the
child's insurance carrier. Finally, families who indicated
that they had had a negative experience in the past year
with the child's health care provider doubled their odds of
having a negative experience with their health care insurer,
relative to those families who did not have a negative expe-
rience (Table 3; OR = 2.08, p < .05). This model explained
nearly one third of the variance in the dependent variable
(Nagelkerke R2 = .31, 2 = 54.32, p < .001).
While these results are consistent with some of the expec-
tations we articulated earlier in this study, there were some
predictor variables that did not significantly affect the odds
of our respondents' reporting a negative experience with
their health care insurer. Household income did not signifi-
cantly affect having a negative health care experience with
the carrier, which was a bit surprising, as prior research has
documented that upper-income individuals are more likely to
challenge decision-making in medical organizations (e.g.,
Haug & Lavin, 1983; Mullis, 1995). Having an unmet need
for ASD services did not reach statistical significance
(although the coefficient was in the expected direction),
which was also of note, due to the fact that unmet need for
services is a challenge faced by families who are caring for a
child (or children) with ASD (Chiri & Warfield, 2012;
Strickland et al., 2011). Our findings suggest that unmet need
is not a critical factor in having a negative experience with
the health insurer--rather, it is the knowledge of policies and
laws regarding ASD that is a driving factor in families'
chances of reporting a negative experience with their health
insurance organization.
Discussion
In this study, we investigated three research questions:
Research Question 1: What, if any, are the correlates of
negative experiences between caregivers of a child with
ASD and their health care providers?
Research Question 2: What, if any, are the correlates of
negative experiences between caregivers of a child with
ASD and their health insurance companies?
Research Question 3: Do they overlap?

The results of our research answer the third question most
clearly: Distinct factors significantly affect the odds of hav-
ing a negative experience with the health care provider ver-
sus the odds of having a negative experience with the health
care insurer. Thus, one conclusion of our study is that fami-
lies who are caring for their child (or children) with ASD
make conceptual distinctions between the two entities when
they are identifying challenges associated with providing
services for them.
This finding is a significant contribution to the ASD lit-
erature. Many studies of negative health experiences among
these families focus either on parents' interactions with
direct-service health care providers, such as doctors and
nurses (Hutton & Caron, 2005; Ryan & Cole, 2008; Todd &
Jones, 2003; Valentine, 2010) or highlight families' chal-
lenges to receive services for their affected children by using
medical surveillance approaches to document their unmet
needs (Chiri & Warfield, 2012; Ghandour et al., 2014; Kogan
et al., 2008; Warfield & Gulley, 2006). Our research suggests
that both the direct-service health care providers and the fis-
cal guarantor of health care services (health care insurers)
figure into negative experiences among families caring for a
child (or children) with ASD, but in different ways.
Factors that increased the odds of the family having a
negative health care experience with the child's doctor, due
to the child's ASD, were rural residence, household income,
the respondent's not taking a job due to factors attributed to
the child's ASD, and whether a family member had not
taken a promotion as a result of having a child with ASD.
Respondents living in rural residences expressed increased
odds of a negative experience with their health care pro-
vider. While we did not ask our respondents to report how
many miles they must drive to access services for their child
with ASD, patients in rural areas consistently report driving
distance as a barrier to accessing regular medical care visits
(Arcury et al., 2005). As such, our finding is consistent with
conflict that may arise between a health care provider and a
rural family who may have difficulty keeping weekly
appointments for ASD services such as occupational ther-
apy, applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy, and other
interventions.
Household income also significantly increased the odds
that a family would have a negative experience with the
health care provider, with higher-income households having
greater odds of a negative experience than lower-income
households. This was the case, even after controlling for any
financial difficulties the family may have experienced, due
to the child's ASD. It is entirely possible that the negative
experience reported by higher socioeconomic households is
consistent with other research studies finding a link between
higher-income individuals and questioning a physician's
authority. Specifically, Haug and Levin (1981, 1983) found
that persons who have higher incomes are more likely than
lower-income persons to raise questions with a doctor about
their medical advice and request greater discussions
of medical issues with their doctor. While their effects are
indirect, through increased health knowledge, our income
variable has a direct effect on negative interactions with the
provider. Similarly, Mullis' (1995) research indicates that
higher-income persons have a greater propensity to file mal-
practice lawsuits than lower-income persons. While we did
not measure these types of dynamics with health care provid-
ers, our finding is consistent with an interpretation of higher-
income households potentially being more willing to
articulate their negative experiences with a health care pro-
vider, relative to lower-income households.
Families who altered their work habits due to their child's
ASD also experienced increased odds of a negative experi-
ence with the health care provider, relative to families who
did not make these choices. Specifically, persons who either
did not take a job or who did not take a promotion, ostensibly
to accommodate the needs of their child or children with
ASD, doubled their odds of a negative experience with the
child's health care provider. While these variables are consis-
tent with an interpretation of the financial impact of caring
for a child with ASD, they remained statistically significant
even after household income was held constant in our regres-
sion models. It is entirely possible that their link to a negative
experience with a child's health care provider may be due to
their frustration or sense of loss regarding their altered career
trajectory (Gordon et al., 2007; Stoner & Stoner, 2014). It
may also be the case that the parent with the altered career
trajectory has gained both practical and medical knowledge
about ASD, thus increasing their willingness to question
medical authorities about their child's care (Gray, 1994;
Ryan & Cole, 2008). We do not have the necessary measures
to isolate these intervening effects; thus, we leave them for
future research.
Factors that increased the odds of having a negative expe-
rience with the health care insurer were the respondent's
awareness of laws and policies regarding ASD, experiencing
financial problems, due to the child's ASD, and having a
negative experience with the child's doctor in the past year.
Families who reported having financial problems in the past
year due to their child's ASD had a fourfold increase in the
odds of a negative experience with their health care insurer,
relative to families who did not experience money problems.
This finding was in the expected direction and consistent
with the literature on the financial hardships of caring for a
child with ASD (Ghandour et al., 2014; Kogan et al., 2008).
The fact that this variable significantly affected the odds of a
negative experience with the health insurance carrier but did
not affect the odds of a negative experience with the health
care provider suggests that families are aware of which of
these two entities makes the fiscal decision about access to
health care resources for ASD. Families who had a negative
experience with their child's health care provider also had
double the odds of having a negative experience with their
health insurance carrier, relative to families who did not have
a negative experience. Thus, altered work habits, rural
Drapela and Baker 11
residence, and household income have indirect effects on
negative experiences with health insurance carriers, via their
direct effects on negative experiences with health care
providers.
Respondents who said they were aware of laws and poli-
cies for ASD had triple the odds of having a negative health
experience with their health insurance carrier, relative to
those who did not have such awareness, a finding consistent
with the notion that when individuals educate themselves
about options that are available to them, they are more likely
to critically evaluate their current situation than if they were
not aware of such options (e.g., Todd & Jones, 2003).
Because parents of children with ASD often find themselves
in the position of being both caregiver and case manager for
the services their child needs, they act as an intermediary
among pediatricians, specialists, and health insurance carri-
ers. Such pervasive engagement in social infrastructures may
lead to politicization of stakeholders, producing a potentially
quite positive effect for society at large--vibrantly engaged
discourse in a democratic context. However, as this study
suggests, it might also be associated with increased potential
for negative experiences with social infrastructures upon
which the stakeholder depends.
The study is not without its limitations. Foremost among
them is our use of a non-probability sampling design. While
this approach gave us an opportunity to model relationships
among a much larger sample of families than had been done
to date (Gray, 1994; Hutton & Caron, 2005; Ryan & Cole,
2008; Todd & Jones, 2003; Valentine, 2010), our findings
have limited generalizability due to our convenience sam-
pling strategy. Second, because our data are cross-sectional
rather than longitudinal, we can only interpret the relation-
ships among our variables as associations. We cannot iden-
tify the causal mechanisms affecting negative experiences
between caregivers of a child with autism, their health care
providers, and their health care insurers. Thus, while we
were able to identify distinct direct effects of our predictor
variables on the odds of negative experiences with health
care providers and health care insurers, we did not have the
measures to investigate the intervening mechanisms that
might explain these direct effects. Future studies on families'
negative experiences with health care insurers should use
longitudinal data to more closely investigate the link between
their awareness of laws and policies for ASD, their level of
engagement in activism, and conflict between the insurers
and the insured, for example. Finally, the results of our study
may have varied among members of different racial and eth-
nic groups, as access to health care in general varies signifi-
cantly by race and social class (Arcury et al., 2005). We were
not able to assess these effects due to very limited data on the
race and ethnicity of our respondents.
Despite these caveats, our study underscores the need for
researchers in ASD policy to consider ground-level health
practitioners as distinct conceptual entities from health care
bureaucracies. This is critically important for scholars whose
research populations are located in countries with a robust
private market for health care services, as is the case in the
United States. This is also an important distinction in the
study of health care in the United States, as the country enters
into a period of transition during the implementation of the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-
148), passed by Congress in 2010.
In seeking services for a child with ASD, many parents
learn about their child's disability and learn to work with the
diagnosis (Valentine, 2010). In doing so, they work to
become aware of the resources inside and outside what is
being offered to them that can help their child. Such an
awareness is gained through parents' educating themselves
about the ASD diagnosis and understanding what services
may best fit with the child's presenting behaviors. This
knowledge is usually obtained through a combination of
information from the health care provider, Internet research,
and books on ASD and its related conditions: for example,
Kranowitz & Miller's (2005) The Out-of-Sync Child,
Simone's (2010) Aspergirls, or Norall's (2009) Quirky,
Yes--Hopeless, No.
In addition, parents may also embark upon learning how to
negotiate their health care plan to maximize the services for
which the child is eligible, or get the health care provider to
pay for services once their out-of-pocket deductibles for ser-
vices have been reached. Such tasks may contribute to par-
ents' greater awareness of the impact of health care policy on
the lives of citizens. However, as is described in Paul Offit's
Autism's False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and
the Search for a Cure, not all awareness is created equal.
Ideally, experts working with children who have ASD and the
parents of those children come together to promote policy
interventions designed to improve their lives rather than being
associated with more negative interactions. The results of this
research suggest that alleviating these families' negative
experiences will have distinct paths for the health care pro-
vider versus the health insurance carrier. Perhaps building
positive interactions will have distinct paths as well.
