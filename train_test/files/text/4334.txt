Introduction
Social experience of people's existence within a certain type
of institutional organization of the society determines the
corresponding type of civic culture reflected in specific val-
ues, norms, and behavior. It is the specificity of institutional
space that determines national differences in the levels of
civic engagement and in the membership in voluntary or
charitable organizations in particular. The above differences
not only consist in the extent of involvement of a certain
country's population in voluntary associations but also strat-
ify the factors of this involvement. Defining such factors in
the context of cross-cultural peculiarities remains rather
crucial.
Among a great number of theoretical approaches, which
explain the factors of membership, there are several ones
singled out in the present-day empirical investigations. The
adherents of socioeconomic approach think that the eco-
nomic status is a stimulus of participation in a voluntary orga-
nization. The above status is traditionally defined as a
derivative of income, employment, educational background,
and so on. Sociological surveys have certified a considerable
effect of such factors as education (a higher level of member-
ship is recorded among more educated people), employment
(a higher level of membership is recorded among the employed
than unemployed), and extent of employment (fully
employed people are more disposed to membership than par-
tially employed ones; Curtis, Grabb, & Baer, 1992; Moyser
& Parry, 1997; Scott, 1957). High correlation is observed
between gross domestic product (GDP) of a certain country
and level of participation in voluntary and human rights pro-
tection organizations (Lane, 2006). High socioeconomic sta-
tus ensures free time habits and competence for effective
involvement in voluntary organizations. However, the effect
of this factor among other factors in each country calls into
question its universality and permanency.
The theory of social capital asserts that activities in volun-
tary organizations are determined by accumulated social
resource, that is, by staying in informal networks and by trust in
people and social institutions. Membership density in associa-
tions is connected first of all with the degree of interindividual

Determinants of Involvement in Work for
Voluntary or Charitable Organizations in
European Countries
Oleksandr Reznik1
Abstract
Differences in democratic traditions and socioeconomic development of various countries leave a mark on the extent of
involvement in work for voluntary organizations. The author makes an attempt to check whether these differences have
an effect on the determinants of such kind of involvement. Socioeconomic status, social capital, civic engagement, and
political participation were considered as determinants. Multiple linear regressions based on the data of the third and sixth
rounds of European Social Survey (ESS-3 and ESS-6) were used to clarify configurations of the factors' effect. The analysis
has shown that socioeconomic factors and main components of social capital proved insignificant. Instead, the behavioral
components of civic engagement and political participation turned out to be the most influential and distributed among most
European countries. The influence of participation in social activities on the involvement in work for voluntary or charitable
organizations is rather inherent in European societies with stable democracy and developed economy.

trust between citizens and with their perception of the extent
of reciprocity and favor (Putnam, Leonardi, & Raffaella,
1993). Time of residence in a certain territory, regular con-
tacts with friends, relatives, neighbors favor taking roots by
an individual in social structure (Fahmy, 2006; Tam Cho &
Rudolph, 2008) . It is the disposition to social interaction at
the place of residence that makes an individual able to reach
mutual understanding with like-minded persons. The ability
to interact in the process of joining a voluntary organization
determines cooperative habits that favor the formation of
horizontal networks of civil society. However, it is a paradox
that empirical investigations in some countries often reveal a
weak correlation between the model of social capital (espe-
cially when it concerns a factor of trust) and membership in
voluntary associations (Howard & Gilbert, 2008; Li, Pickles,
& Savage, 2005; Pattie, Seyd, & Whiteley, 2003; Wollebaek
& Selle, 2002). It is evident that the effect of social capital
also manifests itself under certain circumstances.
These circumstances indicate expediency of cross-
cultural comparisons. Different regional traditions of social
interaction even in the same country, which have been dem-
onstrated by R. Putnam, point to the existence of culturologi-
cal factors. Under these conditions, the value differences,
along with religious, institutional, and structural ones, are
fixed empirically in international investigations (Curtis,
Baer, & Grabb, 2001; Schofer & Fourcade-Gourinchas,
2001; Wallace, Pichler, & Haerpfer, 2012).
Instead, the experience of political participation, which
favors mastering habits of social interaction in organizational
work, remains a stable factor of membership in voluntary
associations (Diamond, 1999; Erickson & Nosanchuk, 1990;
Hooghe, 2003; McFarland & Thomas, 2006; Sampson,
McAdam, MacIndoe, & Weffer-Elizondo, 2005; Sobieraj &
White, 2004; Somma, 2010; Verba & Nie, 1972). The inte-
gral conception of combining individual and collective forms
of civic engagement was embodied in Civic Voluntarism
Model, which had been formulated by S. Verba with col-
leagues, where resources, motivation, and mobilization
became the factors (Verba, Schlozman, & Brady, 1995).
These three factors reinforce each other and give their own-
ers cumulative political advantages.
Allowing for the existence of relationship between indi-
vidual and collective forms of civic engagement, the author
proposes to consider membership in voluntary associations
as civic practices. The conception of civic practices repre-
sents the whole complex of reproduced, permanent, and sus-
tainable actions. They are realizations of aspirations of the
active part of transitional society to make sociopolitical
transformations (Reznik, 2011). Citizens inform government
about their interests just owing to such behavior. In this
respect, civic practices are systematic, reproducible, and per-
manent actions of different social subjects (individuals and
groups) in public sphere, which are a form of realization of
their own interests and provide existence, reproduction, and
transformation of social and political institutions. In the
process of institutionalization of public sphere (Habermas,
1991; Taylor, 1997) as an informal network for exchange of
information and viewpoints, its subjects acquire the habit of
forming and announcing their opinions, thus producing the
civic practices. Therewith, different traditions of social
order stipulate differences in determination of civic prac-
tices. Under conditions of high level of social differentiation
in a society, the socioeconomic factor comes to the fore-
ground, because education, money, time expenditures, and
so on, prove to be indispensable. However, the socioeco-
nomic factor is not so decisive in the countries of total pros-
perity. There appear other factors of particular importance,
such as social capital, religious practices, and experience of
civic engagement. At the same time, if in stable democratic
societies the involvement in voluntary associations may be
determined by nonpolitical factors, in transitional society
the civic engagement of organizational character is mainly
combined with political participation. Thus, differences in
democratic traditions and socioeconomic development of
different countries leave a mark on the sequence of factors
of the first type.
The author in his analysis proposes to compare the extent
of influence of determinants of involvement in voluntary
associations, which are described in the above approaches,
among different European countries. Thus, the article aims to
find out the configuration of effect of the factors of involve-
ment in work for voluntary associations in the context of dif-
ferences of political and socioeconomic development of
various European countries.
Therefore, the two main hypotheses are as follows:
Hypothesis 1: The involvement in work for voluntary
organizations is mainly determined by individual civic
engagement of behavioral nature, because both individual
and group forms of the civic engagement belong to civic
practices as a common phenomenon.
Hypothesis 2: Configuration of the effect of other factors
of involvement in voluntary organizations depends on
political, cultural, and economic development of the
society.
Data and Method
In terms of methodology, the study of civic practices requires
comparative or monitoring researches, because one can fix
sustainability and reproducibility of practical actions only if
the effect of long-term behavioral tendencies of certain
groups that fall regularly within the sample is being observed.
Another method to differ civic practices from occasional
phenomena is the analysis of their factors. Besides, estab-
lishing factors' hierarchy and its comparison in dynamics
also allows one to ascertain the character of reproducibility
and stability of the stimuli of civic practices. In this case,
cross-cultural comparison is an auxiliary tool for revealing
specificity of membership in voluntary associations.

The empirical base is formed by the array of the third and
sixth rounds of international comparative project European
Social Survey (ESS) held in 2006-2007 and 2012-2013. The
survey of population in European countries by the most
essential sociological indices is conducted every 2 years in
all countries following a single program and a sample that
represents adult population of European countries. In 2003,
they organized an international consortium in Europe with
the aim to conduct a new monitoring project called European
Social Survey (www.europeansocialsurvey.org). Its first poll
was carried out in 2002, and it plans to conduct regular polls
every second year in the future. In the next rounds of research,
the project was joined not only by other EU countries but
also by Albania, Kosovo, Iceland, Israel, Norway, Russia,
Switzerland, Turkey, and Ukraine.
The ESS is one of the best as to methodological substan-
tiation among the present-day international comparative proj-
ects based on the highest methodological standards of modern
empirical sociological studies. This makes it possible to expect
a high quality of data collected by all national research groups
and guarantees the highest possibility for real, comparative
analysis of these data. In each national study, a sampled popu-
lation is people of the age of 15 and older. Each research team
had to ensure an effective sample size--no less than 1,500
respondents for countries with a population more than two
million, and 800 respondents for countries with a population
less than two million. In each country, taking into account their
specific sample design, they evaluated a design effect as a
basis for defining sample size: The sample should ensure the
same representation as a simple random sample of 1,500 (or
800 if the country's population is not sufficiently large). Then,
using the preliminary estimation of the response rate (the pro-
portion of respondents in a planned sample, which could be
actually found and which would agree for an interview), they
defined the necessary sample size and constructed the sample
design (Golovakha, Gorbachyk, & Panina, 2006).
The ESS questionnaire consists of the core (stable moni-
toring part) being repeated in all rounds of the survey and
two to three blocks of questions (each block contains approx-
imately 50 questions) related to a certain aspect included into
only one wave. The core of the questionnaire includes indi-
cators of trust in the major institutions, interest in politics and
political activity, social and political orientations, attitude to
the main social and moral values, social capital and social
exclusion, well-being, and security. In addition, the monitor-
ing part includes basic social and demographic information,
such as number of family members, educational background,
employment and job, nationality, ethnic and religious affilia-
tion, living conditions of family, and so on.
The data were weighed following a standard procedure
(design weights) for percentages in cross-tabulations.
Processing and statistical analysis of the data have been per-
formed using the program package SPSS.
The method of multiple linear regressions was used for
revealing the factors of involvement in work for voluntary or
charitable organizations in European countries. This method
permits one to study more accurately the influence of various
factors on the dependent variable with an ordinal scale. The
method of stepwise entering of the model's factors is used to
construct the multiple linear regressions. But in this case,
construction of certain tables of regression equations for a
greater number of countries could create difficulties for com-
parative analysis and increase considerably the paper vol-
ume. Thus, the method of automatic entering of the model's
factors was used for the sake of convenience and obvious-
ness, because a less number of coefficients permit us to
arrange them more densely in one table. For statistical accu-
racy of the results' interpretation, the author supposes that
the factor in which the significance of the equation coeffi-
cient is maximal (p  .001) should be considered influential.
The ordinal variable applied in ESS-3 and ESS-6 was
used as the dependent one: "In the past 12 months, how often
did you get involved in work for voluntary or charitable
organizations?"; it was measured by a 6-point scale with pos-
sible variants of the answer "1 = At least once a week; 2 = At
least once a month; 3 = At least once every 3 months; 4 = At
least once every 6 months; 5 = Less often; 6 = Never."
As independent variables used in ESS-3 array (see
Appendix A in more detail), the following factors have been
distinguished: (a) socioeconomic status (education, paid
work, satisfaction with household's income), (b) social capi-
tal (trust in others; meeting socially with friends, relatives, or
work colleagues; the number of people with whom one can
discuss intimate and personal matters), (c) civic engagement
(participation in social activities, help others not counting
family/work/voluntary organizations, help or attending
activities organized in the local area), (d) religious practices,
(e) index of political participation, and (f) control variable--
the respondent's age.
As independent variables used in ESS-6 array (see
Appendix B in more detail), the following factors have been
distinguished: (a) socioeconomic status (education, paid
work, satisfaction with household's income), (b) social capi-
tal (trust in others; meeting socially with friends, relatives, or
work colleagues; the number of people with whom one can
discuss intimate and personal matters), (c) civic engagement
(participation in social activities), (d) religious practices, (e)
index of political participation, and (f) control variable--the
respondent's age.
Results
Frequency distribution of the involvement in work for volun-
tary or charitable organizations in each European country
evidences for availability of differences according to the
level of social development (see Table 1). The highest fre-
quency is mainly present in West and North European coun-
tries: Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, France,
Great Britain, the Netherlands, Norway, and Finland. The
lowest frequency was observed in postsocialist countries
4 SAGE Open
(Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, and Ukraine).
In the survey of 2012/2013 (ESS-6), the above-mentioned
differences were reproduced in general (see Table 2): The
highest frequency of the involvement in work for voluntary
or charitable organizations was also present mainly in devel-
oped countries of Europe: the Netherlands, Switzerland,
Germany, Denmark, Great Britain, and Norway. The lowest
frequency was observed in postsocialist countries (Albania,
Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland,
Russia, Slovakia, Ukraine, and Kosovo); Portugal and
Cyprus have joined these countries.
Such arrangement of countries is also observed when tak-
ing into account only those which took part at least once in
the work for voluntary or charitable organizations. The
results of ESS-3 show that about a half or more of population
have an experience of at least once-only involvement in the
horizontal networks of civil society in Norway, Austria,
Switzerland, the Netherlands, Finland, and Ireland. In post-
socialist countries (except for Slovenia, Romania, and
Latvia) and Portugal, a share of one and more involvements
varies within about 24% and below. The results of ESS-6
represent in total previous arrangements: A share of those
who were involved at least once in the work for voluntary or
charitable organizations equals about a half and above of the
population of such countries as Norway, Germany,
Switzerland, the Netherlands, Iceland, Finland, Spain, and
Ireland. Instead, a share of about 30% and below was also
reproduced in postsocialist countries. If the dynamics is
taken into consideration, population of Spain, Slovakia,
Sweden, and Russian Federation has demonstrated an
increasing involvement in the work for voluntary or charita-
ble organizations.
The setting of equations of multiple linear regressions in
European countries according to results of ESS-3 has
revealed differences in the influence of all factors (determi-
nation coefficient adjusted R2) on the dependent ordinal vari-
able of involvement in the work for voluntary or charitable
organizations (see Tables 3 and 4). Rather satisfactory values
(about .4 and above) are those of adjusted R2 indices in
Austria, Portugal, Hungary, and Ukraine. This figure was the
highest in Ukraine--.529, that is, share of influence of all

factors that may be explained on the basis of multiple regres-
sions is 52.9%. Instead, the lowest figures have been fixed in
Bulgaria and Poland, where multiple regressions explain the
influence of factors, selected for analysis, within 15.4% and
17.1%, respectively.
The factors of civic engagement (help others not counting
family/work/voluntary organizations, help or attending
activities organized in the local area) and political participa-
tion are the most distributed and influential among the vast
majority of European countries. The factor "help or attend-
ing activities in the local area" is the biggest among all pre-
dictors, which presented equations in most European
countries. Only in Belgium, Finland, and Sweden, the factor
of political participation proved the most influential one. The
influence of the above factors appeared to be mainly similar
for Austria and France. Instead, the factor "help others not
counting family/work/voluntary organizations" was the most
influential for the Netherlands and Spain.
Participation in social activities and religious practices
has become less distributed factors of involvement in volun-
tary organizations. The low level or absence of the effect of
participation in social activities on the involvement in volun-
tary organizations was mainly fixed (not allowing for such
cases in Spain, Ireland, and Portugal) in postsocialist coun-
tries (Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Russia,
Slovenia, and Ukraine). Such a tendency is also traced in
respect of religious practices, when attending religious ser-
vices has a weak effect or even no effect on the involvement
in voluntary organizations in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia,
Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovakia, and
Ukraine.
Among the factors included in the regression model, such
independent variables as paid work, satisfaction with income
(except for Belgium), and trust in people have no statistically
significant effect on the involvement in work for voluntary or
charitable organizations. The factor of age proved influential

mainlyindevelopedcountries(Spain,France,theNetherlands,
Norway, and Sweden). Educational background turned out to
be influential in Cyprus, Spain, Poland, Portugal, and
Slovenia.
The absence of some indices of civic engagement in the
data array of ESS-6 (help others not counting family/work/
voluntary organizations, help or attending activities in the
local area and political participation) has decreased essen-
tially the adjusted R2 index (see Tables 5 and 6), especially
for Switzerland, Bulgaria, and Ukraine. As a result, effect of
political participation was prevalent. Participation in social
activities and religious practices proved something less but
also rather prevailing factors. The low level or the absence of
the effect of participation in social activities on the involve-
ment in voluntary organizations was fixed in Bulgtaaria,
Switzerland, Czech Republic, Iceland, Poland, Russian
Federation, and Ukraine. Attending religious services has a
weak effect or even no effect on the involvement in volun-
tary organizations in Bulgaria, Switzerland, Estonia, and
Poland.
Besides, indices of social capital proved insignificant in
most countries. The factor of trust in others has manifested
itself only for Great Britain, Italy, Lithuania, and Slovakia.
The factor "meeting socially with friends, relatives, or work
colleagues" was significant only for Czech Republic and
Israel.
The low level or the absence of the effect of participation
in social activities on the involvement in voluntary organiza-
tions has been mainly fixed (except for Switzerland and
Iceland) in postsocialist countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic,
Hungary, Estonia, Iceland, Poland, Russian Federation, and
Ukraine). In contrast to the previous case (ESS-3), results of
ESS-6 show that attending religious services has an influ-
ence on the involvement in work for voluntary organizations
in most European countries (the absence of this effect was
fixed in Bulgaria and Switzerland). At the same time, effect
of the index of discussion of intimate and personal problems
on the involvement in voluntary organizations was fixed in
Slovenia and Slovakia.
Moreover, the socioeconomic index (availability of paid
work) proved insignificant. In the same way, the index of
satisfaction with the household's income has not manifested
any effect on the involvement in work for voluntary organi-
zations in most countries (effect of this factor has been fixed
only in Belgium and Russian Federation). The factor of edu-
cational background was significant in Lithuania, Poland,
and Slovakia. The control variable of age has displayed its
effect on the membership in voluntary organizations in
Albania, Belgium, Estonia, Spain, Norway, and Slovakia.
Conclusion
The major advantage of international comparative investiga-
tions consists in preventing the reproduction of casual social
phenomena, which are usually caused by a special situation
in a certain society. The comparison of the factors' effect on
a certain phenomenon permits one to fix permanent stimuli,
which are present at least in similar geographical environ-
ment and pretend to embrace general identity that has been
formed under similar conditions of political and economic
development. Due to comparative investigations, the most
prevailing (among European countries) determinants of
involvement in the work for voluntary organizations could
be revealed.
In general, we can state that Hypothesis 1 has been con-
firmed. The verification of effect of the sets of predictors
which represent the above theoretical approaches has
revealed in general the advantage of such factors as civic
engagement and political participation. The dynamics of
reproduction and sequence of the effect of these predictors,
as well as essential decrease of adjusted R2 indices when
some of them are absent confirm that membership in volun-
tary organizations belongs to the phenomenon of civic prac-
tices. The behavioral potential is common for these factors.
Combining of civic engagement and political participation
provides active social subjects (both individual and group
ones) with resources and skills necessary for searching suc-
cessful examples of civil behavior capable of becoming deci-
sive in the functioning of civil society. Civic practices are
structured by forms of involvement, which in turn determine
the expediency of individual or collective method of defend-
ing interests. The analysis has proved that involvement in
social activities and civic engagement in European countries
creates the basis for informal networks of social interaction;
owing to this interaction, subjects acquire skills to form and
promulgate their views, to exchange information and pro-
duce in this way civic practices. Thus, civic practices become
a social resource for obtaining desirable social positions and
benefits, increasing chances in stratificational rivalry, and
directing the process of political institutionalization of
society.
However, the author's supposition that the effect of other
factors related to the involvement in voluntary organizations
depends on political traditions and socioeconomic develop-
ment of the society has not obtained precise confirmation as
a result of analysis of two comparative studies. It may only
be asserted that the low level or absence of effect of the fac-
tor of participation in social activities on the involvement in
voluntary organizations was mainly present in postsocialist
countries. Thus, nonpolitical behavioral factors of involve-
ment in voluntary organizations are more inherent in coun-
tries with stable democracy and developed economy. The
results of regressions on the basis of ESS-3 concerning the
effect of religious practices have inclined to the conclusion
that the absence of the effect of attending religious services
was mainly fixed in postsocialist countries. However, the
results of regressions on the basis of ESS-6 have demon-
strated that such a tendency was reproduced only in several
countries. The analysis has also shown that socioeconomic
factors and components of social capital as a whole do not

influence the frequency of involvement in work for volun-
tary or charitable organizations. Their inconsiderable influ-
ence was registered only in some countries.
The author's decision to use the method of automatic
entering of the model's factors for building multiple linear
regressions caused certain restrictions. For example, the
optimal determination models have not been revealed.
However, the use of stepwise procedures would make it pos-
sible to remove the less significant predictors and to clarify
the hierarchy of influence of the rest independent variables.
For more detailed analysis of the determinants of involve-
ment in work for voluntary associations, it would be advis-
able to focus on a limited number of countries. It would
allow using more flexible procedures (forward, backward,
stepwise) and building separate tables for each country.
Appendix A
Dependent Variable Used in the Third Round of
European Social Survey (ESS-3) Data
Involvement in work for voluntary or charitable organiza-
tions: Measured as based on Question E1. "In the past
12 months, how often did you get involved in work for
voluntary or charitable organizations?" measured by a
6-point scale with possible variants of answer "1 = At
least once a week; 2 = At least once a month; 3 = At
least once every 3 months; 4 = At least once every 6
months; 5 = Less often; 6 = Never."
Independent Variables Used in the ESS-3 Data

ing into ESS Coding Frame F6. "What is the highest
level of education you have achieved?" by a 7-point
scale, "0 = Not completed primary education; 1 =

second stage of basic; 3 = Upper secondary; 4 = Post
secondary, nontertiary; 5 = First stage of tertiary; 6 =
Second stage of tertiary."

7-point scale was used for measuring the education
level "0 = Not completed primary education; 1 =
Primary or first stage of basic; 2 = Lower secondary or
second stage of basic; 3 = Upper secondary; 4 =
Diploma (Tertiary not university); 5 = Bachelor/
Master/PhD; 6 = Other."

the value 1 for those who have indicated in the answer
to Question F8c: "And which of these descriptions best
describes your situation (in the last 7 days)?" the posi-
tion "paid work (or away temporarily) (employee, self-
employed, working for your family business)," and the
value 0 for those who have not indicated this position.
Satisfaction with household's income: Measured as based
on Question F33, "Which of the descriptions on this

hold's income nowadays?" with possible variants of
answer "1 = Living comfortably with present income;
2 = Coping with present income; 3 = Finding it diffi-
cult with present income; 4 = Finding it very difficult
with present income."
Trust in others: Measured as based on Question A8.

5 = Once a week; 6 = Several times a week; 7 = Every
day."
Number of people with whom one can discuss intimate
and personal matters: Measured as based on Question
C3. "How many people, if any, are there with whom
you can discuss intimate and personal matters?" by a
7-point scale "0 = None; 1 = 1; 2 = 2; 3 = 3; 4 = 4-6; 5
= 7-9; 6 = 10 or more."
Participation in social activities: Measured as based on
Question C4. "Compared with other people of your

3 = About the same; 4 = More than most; 5 = Much
more than most."

ants of answer "1 = At least once a week; 2 = At least
once a month; 3 = At least once every 3 months; 4 = At
least once every 6 months; 5 = Less often; 6 = Never."
