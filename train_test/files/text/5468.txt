Abstract: When women are scarce in a population relative to men, they have greater
bargaining power in romantic relationships and thus may be able to secure male
commitment at earlier ages. Male motivation for long-term relationship commitment may
also be higher, in conjunction with the motivation to secure a prospective partner before
another male retains her. However, men may also need to acquire greater social status and
resources to be considered marriageable. This could increase the variance in male marital
age, as well as the average male marital age. We calculated the Operational Sex Ratio, and
means, medians, and standard deviations in marital ages for women and men for the 50
largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States with 2000 U.S Census data. As
predicted, where women are scarce they marry earlier on average. However, there was no
significant relationship with mean male marital ages. The variance in male marital age
increased with higher female scarcity, contrasting with a non-significant inverse trend for
female marital age variation. These findings advance the understanding of the relationship
between the OSR and marital patterns. We believe that these results are best accounted for
by sex specific attributes of reproductive value and associated mate selection criteria,
demonstrating the power of an evolutionary framework for understanding human
relationships and demographic patterns.

Introduction
Research documents sex differences in average marital age across many different
cultures (Buss, 1989; Fieder and Huber, 2007; Kenrick and Keefe, 1992; Kenrick, Keefe,
Gabrielidis, and Cornelius, 1996; Otta, Queiroz, Campos, da Silva, and Silveira, 1999).
Female scarcity and marital age
This difference represents a male preference for younger women and a female preference
for older men ­ corresponding to the sex-specific attributes of reproductive fitness. Women
invest physiologically in their offspring through gestation and lactation, and faced
considerable mortality risk from childbirth before modern medicine and public health
measures (Guyer, Freedman, Strobino, and Sondik, 2000). It is in a male's best
reproductive interest to mate with highly fecund females. Female fertility declines with age
substantially more so than male fertility, so men tend to prefer younger women as potential
marriage partners (Buss, 1989; Otta et al., 1999).
Men typically invest resources in their partner and offspring. Before fungible
currencies, this investment took the form of the acquisition of food and shelter, as well as
physical care and protection. Thus, women prefer males with high socioeconomic status
(SES), those with an abundance of acquired resources, as marriage partners (Buss, 1989;
Hopcroft, 2006; Otta et al., 1999). Both marriage and divorce rates in the United States
demonstrate the preference for high SES in male marital partners ­ male unemployment is
negatively correlated with both marriage rates and divorce rates (South and Lloyd, 1992a;
South and Spitze, 1986). Previous research has also found a decrease in female non-marital
fertility rates as male unemployment rates increase (South and Lloyd, 1992b).
Higher SES is associated with older male ages because of the time necessary to
acquire and accrue social status and resources ­ attributes related to mate preferences that
have been found in the marital practices of several cultures in different areas of the world
(Buss, 1989; Fieder and Huber, 2007; Kenrick and Keefe, 1992; Otta et al., 1999). Fieder
and Huber (2007) found that the maximum number of offspring produced in a marriage
occurred when the female was six years younger (as reported by Swedish males) and when
the male was four years older (as reported by Swedish females). Although these findings
have sparked a heated debate, especially over the sex-specific aspects of age and maximum
offspring production (Bookstein, Fieder, and Huber, 2008; Boyko, 2008; Fieder, Huber,
and Bookstein, 2008; Kokko, 2008a, 2008b; Lindqvist, Cesarini, and Wallace, 2008), the
general findings provide insight on the sex difference in marital age preference. Ultimately,
males prefer younger females, while females prefer older males, as optimal marital
partners.
Operational Sex Ratio
One of the most important factors influencing marriage rates is the Operational Sex
Ratio (OSR), originally defined as the number of sexually active males per 100 sexually
receptive females (Emlen and Oring, 1977). If the OSR is 100, the population is perfectly
balanced between the sexes. However, in environments where one sex outnumbers the
other, the rarer sex has a reproductive advantage (Fisher, 1958). Members of the scarce sex
are able to be more selective of their partners whereas the other sex faces greater
intrasexual competition in securing a potential mate (Kvarnemo and Ahnesjö, 1996).
When the OSR is male biased, available men outnumber available women and the
greater degree of female choice will increase the male social status and resource potential
necessary for securing female partners. A larger number of available males leads to an
increase in female marital rates (South and Lloyd, 1992a), and with greater bargaining
power, women can secure mates with higher SES, higher fidelity, and a greater willingness

Female scarcity and marital age
to invest in offspring (Pedersen, 1991; Pollet and Nettle, 2008). Thus, men with lower SES
may have an especially difficult time securing a marriage partner in male biased
environments (Pollet and Nettle, 2008). However, a larger proportion of younger men are
married in male biased populations compared to female biased populations, indicating a
greater willingness for earlier commitment to long-term relationships (Kruger and
Schlemmer, 2009).
Conversely, in an environment where the OSR is female biased, males tend to
pursue short-term mating as long as possible (Kruger and Schlemmer, 2009). The lower
intrasexual competition associated with a relative shortage of male competitors allows them
to decrease resource expenditures and avoid marital commitments. Males can continue
short-term mating strategies much longer than in a less female biased population. The
female biased OSR has been linked to increased divorce rates, family conflict, out-of-
wedlock births, and violent crimes (Barber, 2000, 2001, 2003; Guttentag and Secord, 1983;
Pedersen, 1991; South and Lloyd, 1992a). In addition, women have greater difficulties in
obtaining their first marriage (Lichter, Kephart, McLaughlin, and Landry, 1992).
Previous research on imbalanced OSRs has led to other conclusions regarding
marital patterns. For instance, South and Lloyd (1992a) found that male-biased
environments were not only associated with a decrease in birth rates of illegitimate
children, but also increases in both marriage and divorce rates. The increase in marriage
rates, coupled with the decrease in illegitimacy rates, supports the notion that males are
more likely to exhibit long-term mating behaviors in male-biased environments. However,
the increase in divorce rates suggests that an abundance of available males may increase a
female's marital opportunities, possibly leading to mate switching even after marriage.
Hypotheses
In male biased environments, women may encounter many more male suitors and
may also secure a male willing to commit to marriage at an earlier age than women in sex-
balanced or female biased environments. The increased power of female choice may
increase the average marital age of men, as the men may need to acquire higher social
status and a greater extent of resources. Simultaneously, men may be more willing to enter
into committed relationships at earlier ages when women are scarce, and these divergent
influences would lead to greater variance in male marital age. Because of this divergence,
the net effect of the OSR on average male marital age is likely to be weaker than that for
average female marital age. The truncated plausible range for male age in younger
marriages compared to the possible age range in older male marriages may lead to a net
result of older male marriages on average. The present study aims to further our
understanding of human marital commitments in sex-biased populations by testing the
following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: In populations where women are relatively scarce, the average
marital age of women will be significantly lower than in sex-balanced or
female biased populations.
Hypothesis 2: In populations where women are relatively scarce, the
variance in male marital age will be higher than in sex-balanced or female
biased populations.

Hypothesis 3: In populations where women are relatively scarce, the average
marital age of men will be somewhat higher than in sex-balanced or female
biased populations.
Materials and Methods
The Operational Sex Ratio (OSR) in humans is operationally defined as the ratio of
unmarried men to unmarried women, multiplied by 100. Thus, an OSR of 100 indicates a
balance between available men and available women, a male biased OSR of 110 indicates
11 men available for every 10 women available. Using the SPSS 17.0 statistical package,
we calculated the OSR of people between the ages of 18 and 64 years, and the means,
medians, and standard deviations in marital ages for women and men for the 50 largest
Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the United States with year 2000 Census data
(U.S Census, 2001). The 18-64 years-old age cut-off was used in calculating the OSR
because this is the age range from the legal definition of adulthood age until traditional
retirement age in the USA. We used the top 50 MSAs because this sample has previously
demonstrated adequate statistical power for other similar demographic analyses (Kruger
and Schlemmer, 2009). We examined the relationship between the OSR and marital age
indicators both directly (Zero-Order) and controlling for median household income, median
male age, median female age, proportion Black or African American, and proportion
Hispanic or Latino in each MSA (Partial, see Table 1). We controlled for income and race
because of their potential influence on marital behavior. South (1993) found that African-
American men and women tend to desire marriage less than Caucasian men and women,
whereas Hispanic men have an increased desire to marry compared to Caucasian men
(though Hispanic women do not differ from Caucasian women). In addition, income may
have a strong influence on marital age because, as South and Lloyd (1992a) discussed,
when males are unemployed they seem to be less likely to marry but also less likely to
divorce.
Results
The OSR for individuals ages 18 to 64 ranged from 88 in Birmingham, AL and
Memphis, TN, to 116 in Las Vegas, NV (M = 99, SD = 7). See Table 2 in the Appendix for
the descriptives of each MSA. As predicted, when women are scarce they marry earlier on
average (see Figure 1) and the variance in male marital age increased, however there was
no significant relationship with male marital ages (see Figure 2), though the trend was for
earlier marriages. See Table 1 for the correlations.

Discussion
The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between an
imbalanced Operational Sex Ratio (OSR) and marital ages. When the OSR becomes male
biased, females are presented with an abundance of male suitors, which enables greater
selectivity (Pedersen, 1991; Pollet and Nettle, 2008). As predicted, male abundance was
significantly correlated with earlier mean and median female marital ages. This is likely
due to a greater degree of female choice, higher male motivation for commitment to long-
term relationships, and motivation to prevent a prospective female partner from being lost
to a competitor (Kvarnemo and Ahnesjö, 1996).
Female scarcity was also correlated with a greater divergence in male marital ages,
supporting our second prediction. Males who are able to secure marriages with females
earlier in life may be more motivated to do so, yet other males need additional time to
display characteristics making them desirable as long-term mates. Thus, in male biased
populations, there will be both more men who are more similar to their wives in age, and
more men who are considerably older than their wives. This contrasts with a non-
significant inverse trend for female marital age variation.
We did not find a significant relationship between female scarcity and average male
marital age. The trend suggests that the more men committing to marriages at earlier ages
outweighs the longer durations of social status and resource accrual by men facing greater
intrasexual competition and female selectivity. Our sample size may have been inadequate

Female scarcity and marital age
to uncover weak net effects, and increasing the sample size may render this relationship
statistically significant.
Limitations
The present study used 2000 U.S. Census data to calculate the OSR, mean and
median male marital age, and mean and median female marital age. Census data do not
indicate marital order, only whether an individual is married or not married. Because many
marriages in the U.S. end in divorce, it is possible that the marital ages calculated in this
study may not fully reflect the mean and median age of first marriage. However, the pattern
of effects found in this study holds when also controlling for both the proportion of men
and proportion of women who are divorced.
The correlational methodology used in this study does not allow us to directly infer
a causal direction from the OSR to marital age. However, imbalanced OSRs in the
metropolitan areas of the USA are believed to be primarily due to economic migration
(Gwin, 2007). In the Northeastern USA, women have moved from predominantly rural
areas to cities for white collar office careers. Men have moved to cities in the Western USA
for technology-oriented careers (Gwin, 2007). These limitations open possibilities for
future research to replicate our findings and strengthen understanding.
Conclusion and Future Implications
The implications of this study are immense in both their predictive power and
relation to current social issues. For example, recent studies document the massive
demographic imbalance of men and women in China, the world's largest national
population. Because of the implementation of China's single-child law in 1979, combined
with the preference for male children and the progression of ultrasound technology
enabling sex-specific abortions, the OSR in China is increasingly male biased (Ding and
Hesketh, 2006; Zhu and Hesketh, 2009). Although census data from 2005 reported an
overall OSR of 119, some areas are reporting an OSR as high as 130. These researchers
project that by the year 2020 there will be 24 million more men than women in China, and
that if these men do not get married by age 40, they will stand a minimal chance of ever
getting married, will have fewer resources, and will be reliant on social security in old age
(Zhu and Hesketh, 2009).
As previous studies have indicated, women in China will become increasingly
selective of their mates and men will need to commit to long-term relationships whenever
possible to secure and retain a partner (Pedersen, 1991; Pollet and Nettle, 2008). Our
results predict that in China (and anywhere else with a male biased population), women
will marry younger and male marital ages will stratify. Overall, our study demonstrates the
value of an evolutionary theoretical framework for predicting and understanding human
relationships and demographic patterns.
