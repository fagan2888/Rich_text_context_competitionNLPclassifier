Introduction
Youth offending rates are at least double those in adulthood
and those who offend as youths are more likely to experience
problematic criminal life trajectories (Australian Institute of
Criminology [AIC], 2009; Chen, Matruglio, Weatherburn, &
Hua, 2005; Richards, 2011). Longitudinal studies suggest
that environmental and individual factors contribute to the
initiation and maintenance of delinquent behaviors
(Aisenberg&Herrenkohl,2008;Farrington,1995;Farrington
& Loeber, 2000; C. A. Smith & Thornberry, 1995; Valois,
MacDonald, Bretous, Fischer, & Drane, 2002). Thus, identi-
fying key risk factors that are important for predicting recidi-
vism and developing risk management and treatment
strategies in youths is critical.
A body of research indicates that core risk factors for vio-
lence are commensurate across gender (Hare, 1991; Hubbard
& Pratt, 2002; Moffitt, Caspi, Rutter, & Silva, 2001; Webster,
1999). However, proponents of gender-specific risk/needs lit-
erature propose that pertinent unique experiences play an
important role in the development of female criminal trajecto-
ries (Blanchette & Brown, 2006; Bloom, Owen, & Covington,
2002; Chesney-Lind, 1997; Daly, 1992, 1994; Funk, 1999;
Van Voorhis, Salisbury, Wright, & Bauman, 2008; Van
Voorhis, Wright, Salisbury, & Bauman, 2010). Feminist
theories of female criminality comprise contexts of familial
and domestic abuse, characterized by victimization and dys-
functional relationships (Blum, Ireland, & Blum, 2003;
Gavazzi, Yarcheck, & Chesney-Lind, 2006; Hubbard & Pratt,
2002; McCabe, Lansing, Garland, & Hough, 2002; Van
Voorhis et al., 2010). The ensuing traumas are connected to
truancy, substance abuse, economically motivated delin-
quency, mental illness, self-injurious behavior, prostitution,
and further victimization (Chesney-Lind, 1997; Gavazzi et
al., 2006; ; Logan & Blackburn, 2009; Loxley & Adams,
2009; Teplin, Abram, & McClelland, 1996; Timmons-
Mitchell et al., 1997; Vincent, Grisso, Terry, & Banks, 2008;
Wasserman & McReynolds, 2011). Reports indicate the high
rates of mental illness among female offenders compared
with their nonoffending female counterparts and male offend-
ers (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare [AIHW],
2012a;Butler&Allnutt,2003;Cauffman,Lexcen,Goldweber,
Shulman, & Grisso, 2007; Loxley & Adams, 2009; Vincent et
al., 2008). Female offenders are also more likely to report
abusive histories and attempt suicide compared with male
offenders (Gavazzi et al., 2006; Johnson, 2004; Kenny &
Nelson, 2008). Furthermore, illicit drug use among female
offenders is also found to be consistently higher than male
offenders and linked to poorer outcomes (Forsythe & Adams,
2009; Loxley & Adams, 2009; McReynolds, Schwalbe, &
Wasserman, 2010). Moreover, there is evidence that the base
rate of psychopathy in females is much lower than in males
(Cale & Lilienfeld, 2002; Nicholls, Ogloff, Brink, & Spidel,
2005; Weizmann-Henelius, Viemaro, & Eronen, 2004) and

Identifying Gender Differences in an
Australian Youth Offender Population

Abstract
The study examined gender differences in risk factors for violence in a sample of 213 male and female youths held in Youth
Justice Centres in Victoria, Australia. Although violence risk factors are considered to be commensurate across gender, a
growing body of international literature is categorizing gender-specific criminal trajectories. The study aimed to investigate
this concept in an Australian juvenile context. Through the use of a widely validated youth violence risk assessment inventory,
the prevalence of salient risk items was compared across gender. Young female offenders were found to present with higher
levels of family dysfunction, peer rejection and self-injurious behavior reflecting international female offending pathways
literature.

there are gender differences across items (Bolt, Hare, Vitale,
& Newman, 2004; Forouzan & Cooke, 2005; Strand &
Belfrage, 2005). Feminist writers argue that current risk
assessment instruments may overlook such pathways that
could ultimately result in misclassifying female offenders
(Brennan, 1998; Reisig, Holtfreter, & Morash, 2006; Taylor
& Blanchette, 2009). The omission of crucial gender-specific
factors for delinquency could also have repercussions for
treatment strategies that require an understanding of the etio-
logical issues that prompt female criminality.
There is a paucity of research exploring gender differ-
ences on adolescent risk inventories. Given that current offi-
cial data indicate that young female contact with justice
systems appear to be increasing in Australia (AIC, 2011;
Holmes, 2010; Victoria Police, 2010), the United States
(Puzzanchera & Adams, 2011; Puzzanchera, Adams, &
Hockenberry, 2012), Canada (Kong & AuCoin, 2008), and
the United Kingdom (Ministry of Justice [MOJ], 2009), there
is a need to examine the utility of youth inventories across
gender to ensure the relevant dynamics are identified for
treatment targets and interventions.
The Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth
(SAVRY, see appendix), a violence risk assessment inven-
tory has been shown to predict violent recidivism for young
females across custodial settings (Gammelgård, Koivisto,
Eronen, & Kaltiala-Heino, 2008; Lodewijks, de Ruiter, &
Doreleijers, 2008; Meyers & Schmidt, 2008; Penney, Lee, &
Moretti, 2010; Schmidt, Campbell, & Houlding, 2011). In
this study, the risk item scores of the SAVRY, which cover
Historical, Social/Contextual, and Individual/Clinical fac-
tors, will be equated and paralleled across gender.
We anticipate comparable SAVRY total scores between
male and female offenders though predict potential differ-
ences on domain and individual item scores pertaining to
familial and social relationships, mental health, self-harm,
and substance abuse in accordance with the literature on gen-
der-specific risk factors for violence.
Method
Participants
A total of 215 male and female youth were recruited from the
Youth Justice Centres in Victoria, Australia: Parkville Youth
Justice Precinct (PYJP) and Malmsbury Youth Justice Centre
(MYJC). PYJP accommodates young men and women aged
10 to 17 years who have been remanded or sentenced by a
Victorian court, and young women 18 to 20 years who have
been sentenced by a Victorian Court. MYJC accommodates
young men aged 18 to 20 years who have been sentenced by
a Victorian Court. Two young people were excluded due to
incomplete SAVRY data. The final total sample comprised
213 people (175 males, 38 females). This proportion of par-
ticipants across gender is representative of Australian youth
offender facilities where females consist on average 10% of
prisoners (Richards & Lyneham, 2010). The mean age of the
sample was 16.84 (SD = 1.83). Female offenders did not sig-
nificantly differ on age (M = 16.39, SD = 1.93) compared
with males (M = 16.94, SD = 1.80; U = 2,770.50, z = -1.636,
p = .102). The index offenses of participants were Assault
(36%), Robbery (17%), Burglary/Theft (17%), and Property
Damage (7%). For males, the top three index offenses com-
prised Assault (37%), Robbery (16%), and Burglary/Theft
(12%). For females, the top three were Burglary/Theft (38%),
Assault (23%), and Robbery (23%). Approximately half the
sample had previously been sentenced to custodial or com-
munity orders (48%) with male offenders having a similar
number of total previous orders (M = 4.85, SD = 4.13) com-
pared with female offenders (M = 3.30, SD = 2.75; U =
239.00, z = -1.038, p = .299). The ethnic breakdown of the
sample included English-speaking background (48%), cul-
turally and linguistically diverse (32%), and indigenous
(20%). English-speaking background participants repre-
sented the Anglo-Saxon/Caucasian majority. Culturally and
linguistically diverse participants included minorities from
non-English-speaking backgrounds (e.g., Lebanese, Pacific
Islander, and African). The indigenous ethnic group included
participants with Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander heritage.
Measures
The SAVRY is a risk inventory that adopts a Structured
Professional Judgment (SPJ) paradigm. It was designed to
predict violent behavior in youths 12 to 18 years old (Borum,
Bartel, & Forth, 2003) and comprises 24 risk markers divided
into three subscales assessing Historical, Social/Contextual,
and Individual domains (see appendix). The Historical
domain includes static items focusing on prior behaviors and
experiences. The Social/Contextual domain considers
dynamic factors relating to peer relationships and commu-
nity influences while the Individual domain assesses psycho-
logical patterns and behaviors (Borum et al., 2003). The
subscales are summed to generate a total risk score. As there
are no assigned cutoff scores, a professional arbitration
called the "SAVRY risk rating" is proposed after considering
all SAVRY factors. The instrument also contains six addi-
tional protective factors that have been shown to mitigate the
risk of recidivism (Lodewijks, de Ruiter, & Doreleijers,
2010; Rennie & Dolan, 2010).
Interrater reliability was measured for 28 (13%; 17
females, 11 males) cases assessed independently by two
trained raters. The intraclass correlations (ICCs; single mea-
sure) suggested very high concordance--SAVRY total score:
ICC = .97 ( = .98), SAVRY risk rating: ICC = .97 ( = .99),
Historical domain: ICC = .96 ( = .98), Social/Contextual
domain: ICC = .90 ( = .95), Individual/Clinical domain:
ICC = .94 ( = .97), and Protective Factors domain: ICC =
.96 ( = .98)--supporting the reliability of the SAVRY in the
present sample.

Procedures
The study was approved by the Victorian Department of
Human Services and the Monash University Human
Research Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants. Consent for participants under
18 years of age fell within the "mature minor" concept as
described in local Victorian legislation where mental compe-
tency is determined by the ability of an underage participant
to understand or appreciate points pertaining to their partak-
ing in and the nature of the study.
Participants were interviewed individually in a private
room allocated by youth justice custodial centre staff.
SAVRY coding was completed using information from inter-
views and youth justice file material and was conducted by
master-level researchers who had completed a SAVRY train-
ing course.
Data Handling and Analysis
Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 18. Due to unequal
sample sizes, group differences in mean scores on the
SAVRY domains were examined using a Mann­Whitney
U test. Chi-square analysis was used to examine group dif-
ferences on individual SAVRY items. Item scores were
dichotomized.Arisk rating of "high" denoted higher risk and
a rating of "medium/low" combined represented lower risk.
Chapman, Desai, Falzer, and Borum (2006) had previously
employed a dichotomy of "high/medium" and "low" risk. In
this study, we employed a "high" separation as we believe it
enabled a clearer identification of participants who strongly
presented as high risk on a particular factor.
Results
Gender Differences in SAVRY
Domain Scores and Overall Risk Rating
Table 1 shows the means, standard deviations, and U-test
scores for male and female clients. Overall, approximately
50% of the sample was rated as high risk on the SAVRY risk
rating. Both groups had high proportions of their respective
totals in the high-risk rating category as shown in Figure 1.
The female group had a marginally higher SAVRY total
score than the males but this did not reach significance.
Females had significantly higher mean scores compared with
males on the Historical and Social/Contextual domains.
Gender Differences on SAVRY Individual Items
Table 2 shows the proportions across gender who received a
high score on individual SAVRY items. Both genders had
large proportions of high ratings on items "History of vio-
lence," "History of nonviolent offending," "Peer delin-
quency," "Substance abuse difficulties," and "Anger
management problems." Comparing genders, female youth
were significantly more likely than male youth to score
highly on items "History of self-harm/suicide attempts,"

tion," "Peer rejection," and "Poor parental management."
Looking at protective factors, both genders had low per-
centages of their cohorts reporting the presence of items
"Strong social support" and "Strong commitment to school."
Male youth were significantly more likely than female youth
to report "prosocial involvement."
Discussion
This study examined gender differences in risk markers of
violent offending using the SAVRY in a sample of Australian
youth offenders in custody. Male and female youths had sim-
ilar SAVRY total scores and high portions of their respective
samples receiving a high-risk rating. However, there are a
number of significant differences across gender at the domain
and item levels.
The mean overall SAVRY score (M = 26.66) of this sam-
ple was higher than previous North American and European
studies, which have ranged between 18 and 24 (Dolan &
Rennie, 2008; Lodewijks et al., 2008; Schmidt et al., 2011;
Spice, Viljoen, Gretton, & Roesch, 2010; Vincent, Chapman,
& Cook, 2011; Welsh, Schmidt, McKinnon, Chattha, &
Meyers, 2008). It is possible that the comparatively high-risk
scores in our sample reflect jurisdictional differences in
youth diversionary policies, as only the most severe cases
receive a custodial sentence inVictoria,Australia (Sentencing
Advisory Council [SAC], 2012). Similarly, female criminal
misconduct in Australia and particularly Victoria is more
likely to result in community-based penalties compared with
males (AIHW, 2012b; SAC, 2012). Therefore, the females in
our custodial sample may represent more high-risk female
offenders than would be found in other jurisdictions and may
mask gender differences in our sample. This may account for

the higher female SAVRY total scores (M = 28.82) found in
the present study compared with total scores for institution-
alized female youth found by Gammelgård et al. (2008) and
Lodewijks et al. (2008) at 18 and 19, respectively.
Our study found no significant difference between female
and male youth on SAVRY total scores or summary risk rat-
ings. The findings were similar to other SAVRY studies
comparing gender (Lodewijks et al., 2008; Penney et al.,
2010; Schmidt et al., 2011; Welsh et al., 2008). Furthermore,
studies using the Youth Level of Service/Case Management
Inventory (YLS/CMI), a general adolescent risk instrument
designed to address criminogenic needs (Hoge & Andrews,
2006), have found comparable total scores across gender
(Jung & Rawana, 1999; Luong, 2007; Olver, Stockdale, &
Wong, 2012; Schmidt et al., 2011; Schmidt, Hoge, & Gomes,
2005; Welsh et al., 2008). Conversely, male offenders have
presented with significantly higher total scores and risk rat-
ings compared with females on the SAVRY (Gammelgård et
al., 2008; Gammelgård, Weizmann-Henelius, Koivisto,
Eronen, & Kaltiala-Heino, 2012) and theYLS/CMI (Onifade
et al., 2008). In addition, an Australian study by Thompson
and McGrath (2011), albeit in another jurisdiction, found
female youth involved with the New South Wales (NSW)
juvenile justice system had significantly higher general
recidivism risk scores compared with their male counter-
parts. The inconsistencies between genders on total risk
scores may reflect the differences in correctional samples
that originate from jurisdictional variations in justice guide-
lines. Alternatively, these inconsistencies raise questions
about the utility of total risk scores when considering gender
differences in propensity for violence and the need to con-
sider domain or specific factors.
Domains
Few studies have addressed differences in domain scores
across gender. This study found significant gender differ-
ences on the Historical and Social/Contextual domains of
the SAVRY where females presented with higher mean
scores than males. This suggests that the adverse life expe-
riences and the current criminogenic social circumstances
of the females in this sample were more severe than their
male counterparts. Previous studies exploring gender dif-
ferences across SAVRY domains have produced inconsis-
tent findings. Two studies found no significant gender
differences across domains (Gammelgård et al., 2008;
Meyers & Schmidt, 2008), conversely one study found
males had significantly higher scores than females on the
Individual/Contextual domain (Penney et al., 2010). Studies
looking at gender differences in the YLS/CMI domains
have also had inconsistent findings with some reporting no
gender differences (Jung & Rawana, 1999; Schmidt et al.,
2005), though others report gender differences in at least
one domain (Olver et al., 2012; Schmidt et al., 2011;
Thompson & McGrath, 2011).
Looking at protective factors, the domain mean totals of
the present study were in line with previous SAVRY studies
(Dolan & Rennie, 2008; Lodewijks et al., 2008; Schmidt et al.,
2011) and no significant domain differences were discovered
across gender. The quantity of protective factors displayed
appears similar across gender, though there were discrepan-
cies in individual factor occurrence. As the literature on gen-
der differences across domain totals is meager and
inconsistent, an examination of gender differentiation on the
individual items contributing to the domain scores is of more
benefit.
Individual Items
At the individual item level, both genders had over half
their respective cohorts receiving a high-risk rating on a
number of items. Although a history of violent and nonvio-
lent offending was common (>70%) in males and females,
rates did not significantly differ. Previous SAVRY research
has found strong correlations between the Historical
domain, which contains these items, and future violent
recidivism for male and female youth in custody (Dolan &
Rennie, 2008; Gammelgård et al., 2008; Penney et al.,
2010). In addition, studies on the YLS/CMI suggest that
the "Criminal history" item predicts future recidivism
across gender. Previous offending is known to be a signifi-
cant predictor of future recidivism (Farrington, 1995;
Farrington & Loeber, 2000; Lynch, Buckman, & Krenske,
2003; Moffitt, 1993) and appears to be a consistent risk
marker across the genders. The lack of gender differences
in rates of prior offending in this study may reflect data
suggesting that adolescent female offending is increasing
more steadily than male offending. Research suggests that
increases in rates of female violence are more the result of
net-widening risk management policy shifts resulting in a
greater number of females being processed as offenders
rather than cogent changes in female behavior (Carrington,
2006; Deakin & Spencer, 2003; Steffensmeier, Schwartz,
Zhong, & Ackerman, 2005). Nonetheless, in a severe sam-
ple of chronic male and female youth offenders, it is likely
that both groups would share similar problematic criminal
histories.
The item "Peer delinquency" was similarly prevalent
(>65%) in our cohort. This is consistent with research show-
ing that youth gang membership is often a precursor to anti-
social behavior (Battin, Hill, Abbott, Catalano, & Hawkins,
1998; Thornberry, 1998) and reports that delinquent females
are frequently involved in illegal gang activity (Moore &
Hagedorn, 2001). While similar levels of peer delinquency
are observed, the role and influence these relationships have
on offending may differ across the genders. In particular,
research describes the specific influence antisocial male
partners and acquaintances can have on females with respect
to offending behavior (Chesney-Lind, Morash, & Stevens,
2008; Foster, Hagan, & Brooks-Gunn, 2004; Heilbrun et al.,
6 SAGE Open
2008; Robertson & Murachver, 2007; Schaffner, 2006;
Stattin & Magnusson, 1990), suggesting that peer delin-
quency may represent a greater risk marker for females com-
pared with males.
Gender differences were noted with females receiving
higher risk ratings than males on items reflecting problem-
atic family and peer group relationships. This is consistent
with reports that a high proportion of imprisoned females
lack stable and supportive families (Chesney-Lind et al.,
2008; Gavazzi et al., 2006; Hubbard & Pratt, 2002; McCabe
et al., 2002; Van Voorhis et al., 2010). Moreover, family
factors tapping caregiver­child interaction and connected-
ness have been found to be a better predictor of female
offending than for males (Blum et al., 2003; Farrington &
Painter, 2004; Funk, 1999). Previous studies using the YLS/
CMI have found that females are significantly more likely
to score higher than males on the "Family" domain that
addresses inadequate supervision and poor relationships
with parents (Olver et al., 2012; Schmidt et al., 2011,
Thompson & McGrath, 2011). As inadequate parental
supervision and communication is linked with future delin-
quency (Capaldi & Patterson, 1996; Gavazzi et al., 2006;
Loeber & Stouthamer-Loeber, 1986), family-based inter-
ventions such as multisystemic therapy may be of particu-
lar value in reducing offending behavior in females
(Henggeler, Melton, & Smith, 1992; Schaeffer & Borduin,
2005), who are thought to be more adversely affected than
males when family and social bonds are disrupted
(Cernkovich & Giordano, 1987; Funk, 1999; Gilligan,
1982; Van Voorhis et al., 2010).
In the present study, females had significantly higher rates
of peer rejection than males. Negative developmental experi-
ences with peers have been identified as risk factors for
future delinquency (Hubbard & Pratt, 2002; Kupersmidt,
Coie, & Dodge, 1990; Moffitt et al., 2001). Gender-specific
literature suggests that female pathways to crime often origi-
nate from abusive, chaotic, lawless homes and relationships
(Blum et al., 2003; Daly, 1992, 1994; Hoyt & Scherer, 1998;
Owen & Bloom, 1995; Simpson, Yahner, & Dugan, 2008).
The relatively high female SAVRY total scores from our
sample are likely to reflect the presence of these "pathway"
items.
Witnessing violence in the home is a risk factor for future
violence and aggression, particularly as youths model their
behavior on the interactions and responses of their caregivers
(Elliott, 1994; Herrera & McCloskey, 2001). In this study,
females were significantly more likely than males to have
had exposure to violence at home. Indeed, our female sample
frequently reported periods of homelessness and domestic
abuse from older and often delinquent partners suggesting
that they are leaving dysfunctional families and entering into
disharmonious relationships with partners.
Furthermore, females were significantly more likely than
males to have a history of self-harm or suicide attempts. The
latter finding is consistent with previous research (Indig
et al., 2010; Miller, 1994; Veysey & Hamilton, 2007) and in
earlier SAVRY studies (Gammelgård et al., 2008; Lodewijks
et al., 2008; Penney et al., 2010). Female prisoners are
reported to have suffered high rates of physical and sexual
trauma (Chesney-Lind et al., 2008; Forsythe & Adams,
2009; Indig et al., 2010; Johnson, 2004; Rettinger &
Andrews, 2010; Siegel & Williams, 2003; Wasserman &
McReynolds, 2011), which may in turn contribute to subse-
quent psychiatric symptomatology (Belknap & Holsinger,
2006; Teplin, Abram, McClelland, Dulcan, & Mericle,
2002; Timmons-Mitchell et al., 1997; Tye & Mullen, 2006;
Vincent et al., 2008). Self-injury in female offenders tends
to be associated with high rates of psychopathology as well
as an increased risk for violent recidivism (Vollm & Dolan,
2009) making this a significant treatment target for female
offenders.
Substance abuse rates were high in the cohort with more
than three quarters of males and females receiving a high-
risk rating for this item, indicating chronic drug and alcohol
use. Although there were no gender differences in rates of
substance abuse, our data are consistent with other studies
noting a high prevalence of substance use among youth
offenders (Prichard & Payne, 2005; Sedlak & McPherson,
2010; Wei, Makkai, & McGregor, 2003). Previous studies
have found higher rates of problematic substance use
among female offenders (Coid et al., 2009; Forsythe &
Adams, 2009; Gately, Fleming, Morris, & McGregor, 2012;
Indig et al., 2010; Loxley & Adams, 2009). Female offend-
ers have been found significantly more likely than males to
score higher on the "Substance Abuse" domain using the
YLS/CMI (Olver et al., 2012; Thompson & McGrath, 2011)
and its adult version, the Level of Service Inventory­
Revised (LSI-R; Heilbrun et al., 2008). Furthermore,
Andrews et al. (2012) found the substance abuse item on
the LSI-R to be a stronger predictor of recidivism for female
offenders. As drug and alcohol abuse are key situational
factors that inhibit rational responses and intensify violent
behavior (Farrington & Loeber, 2000; Hoaken & Stewart,
2003; Morgan & McAtamney, 2009), substance abuse
needs to be a key treatment target in offense reduction pro-
grams for both genders.
In this study, the prevalence of protective factors was
low in both genders and this may have contributed to our
high total scores given that protective factors appear to
mitigate violent reoffending (Lodewijks et al., 2010;
Rennie & Dolan, 2010). There were no striking gender dif-
ferences on each item other than females having signifi-
cantly lower levels of prosocial involvement compared
with males. This finding contrasts with that of Gammelgård
et al. (2012) who found higher rates of prosocial involve-
ment among females. The findings appear to suggest that
deviant social peers may have a greater influence on
offending behavior in Australian female offenders and that
the development of more prosocial bonds will be critical in
reducing offending behavior.

Limitations
Some limitations to the study are worth noting. The female
youth cohort in this study may not truly represent the major-
ity of female offenders outside of Victoria, particularly due
to the jurisdictional policy of detaining youth as a last resort,
resulting in only the most severe female youths ending up in
custody. Conversely, the results may generalize to the high-
risk end of young female offenders. Second, the female sam-
ple size was small and comparatively lower than the male
cohort. The disparity is a reflection of the predominance of
male criminality and low proportion of females in the juve-
nile and adult justice systems in Australia. While nonpara-
metric analyses were conducted to account for the discrepant
sample sizes, this did reduce the power of resultant analyses
and the size of effects that could be detected. As such, there
could potentially be further differences between males and
females that went undetected. Conversely, the effects that
were observed in this study are likely to be larger in the pop-
ulation than were observed. Nevertheless, the size of the
female sample was similar to previous SAVRY studies com-
paring gender (Lodewijks et al., 2008; Meyers & Schmidt,
2008; Schmidt et al., 2011). Last, the predictive validity of
the SAVRY instrument was not conducted. The theme of the
article was to identify how the prevalence and severity of
risk items may differ between male and female young offend-
ers in a particularly violent sample. As the SAVRY instru-
ment encompasses a concert of pertinent antecedents to
youth violence, it was selected primarily as a checklist for
gender comparison.
Conclusion
The study contributes to extant literature on risk factors for
youth violence risk, though undertaken in a unique
Australian youth justice context. Gender differences on
SAVRY domains and individual items were discovered.
Factors including family dysfunction/breakdown, peer
rejection, and self-harming behavior were found to be over-
represented among female offenders. The findings reflect
the literature on gendered pathways to offending and in par-
ticular highlight cogent female-specific risk factors that may
manifest through experiences of abuse and associated
trauma. The findings add to the growing base of gender-
specific research highlighting a common array of risk fac-
tors shared by young and adult female offenders.
Multifaceted gender responsive treatment programs focus-
ing on connectivity and emotional guidance, empowerment,
repairing relationships, and specific services providing sup-
port for trauma, abuse, child care, employment opportuni-
ties, and drug dependency could provide unique holistic
support in addressing key needs. Further research is required
to determine the validity of the SAVRY and other widely
used youth violence risk prediction instruments across gen-
der in Australian young offender populations.
