Introduction
The renin­angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important
role in the pathogenesis and progression of chronic kid-
ney disease (CKD). Numerous studies have reported that
activation of the intra-renal RAS contributes to glomeru-
lar hypertrophy, mesangial expansion and glomeruloscle-
rosis in various renal diseases.1 Previous clinical and
experimental studies have demonstrated that inhibition of
the RAS using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor
(ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) results
in the reduction of proteinuria and retards progression of
renal disease in addition to lowering blood pressure.
Even in normotensive or well-controlled hypertensive
patients with CKD, use of RAS blockade resulted in
reduction of proteinuria and may be beneficial in the
preservation of renal function.2­8 However, RAS block-
ade is frequently associated with several adverse events,
including angioedema, dry cough, hyperkalemia, and
aggravation of underlying renal insufficiency.9 In partic-
ular, the incidence of hyperkalemia is increased in
patients with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
and limits the use of RAS blockade in patients with
advanced CKD.10 If the serum potassium level increases
above 5.5 mmol/l during use of RAS blockade, discon-
tinuation of RAS blockade should be considered,11,12 with

Abstract
Hypothesis: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of renin­angiotensin system (RAS) blockade mainte-
nance on renal protection in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with hyperkalemia occurring during treatment with
RAS blockade.
Materials and methods: CKD III or IV patients, who were prescribed with RAS blockers and also had hyperkalemia,
were included. The study population was divided into two groups based on maintenance or withdrawal of RAS blocker.
Renal outcomes (doubling of creatinine or end-stage renal disease) and incidence of hyperkalemia were compared
between the two groups.
Results: Out of 258 subjects who developed hyperkalemia during treatment with RAS blockers, 150 (58.1%) patients
continued on RAS blockades, while RAS blockades were discontinued for more than 3 months in the remaining 108
patients. Renal event-free survival was significantly higher in the maintenance group compared with the withdrawal
group. Cox proportional hazard ratio for renal outcomes was 1.35 (95% CI: 1.08­1.92, p=0.04) in the withdrawal group
compared with the maintenance group. However, the incidence of hyperkalemia and hyperkalemia-related hospitaliza-
tion or mortality did not differ between the two groups.
Conclusions:This study demonstrated that the maintenance of RAS blockade is beneficial for the preservation of renal
function and relatively tolerable in patients with CKD and hyperkalemia occurring during treatment with RAS blockade.

low-potassium diet, thiazide or loop diuretics, and cor-
rection of metabolic acidosis. However, there are differ-
ent approaches to cope with RAS blockers according to
physician preference and decision. A practical strategy
for maintaining the RAS blockade is needed not only for
control of blood pressure, but also to delay the progres-
sion of CKD. In order to maintain the blocking effect of
RAS, ACEI or ARB are frequently maintained in CKD
patients with elevated potassium levels. Still, it is not
clear whether or not maintenance of RAS blockade is
beneficial in CKD patients with elevated potassium
levels.
We examined renal outcomes (doubling of creatinine or
progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD)) in order to
determine the effect of RAS blockade maintenance in
patients with CKD stage III and IV, who had developed
hyperkalemia during use of RAS blockade. In addition, we
evaluated the impact on hyperkalemia of maintenance with
RAS blockade in this population.
Materials and methods
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
(IRB) of Yonsei University Health System Clinical Trial
Center. This study was a retrospective medical record-
based study and the IRB waived the requirement for written
consent from the patients.
Study subjects
Patients with stage III or IV CKD, prescribed ACEI or ARB
and with concurrent hyperkalemia during the use of RAS
blockade were included in this study. We initially recruited
2124 patients who were followed-up for CKD at Yonsei
University Health System from July 2008 to December
2011. ACEIs or ARBs except dual blockers including
aldosterone antagonists were prescribed to 1239 patients,
and 351 patients developed hyperkalemia during treatment
with RAS blocker. Of these patients, 83 patients were
excluded for the following reasons: age younger than 18
years or older than 75 years, terminal malignancy, previous
history of kidney transplantation, and follow-up duration of
less than 12 months. Patients whose serum creatinine and
potassium levels at baseline or during the follow-up period
were not available, or who were transiently discontinued
RAS blockers for less than 3 months were also excluded.
Therefore, a total of 258 patients were included for the final
analysis (Figure 1).

Data collection
Using medical records, demographic and clinical data were
reviewed retrospectively for age, sex, medical history,
medications, time to doubling of baseline serum creatinine
levels and ESRD, and history of admission after study
enrollment. Laboratory data included urinary protein-to-
creatinine ratio (UPCR), and serum creatinine and potas-
sium levels. The four-variable Modification of Diet in
Renal Disease study equation was used for calculation of
the estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR).
Definitions
CKD was defined as an eGFR of less than 60 ml/min/1.73m2
and hyperkalemia was defined as potassium 5.5 mmol/l in
a non-hemolyzed serum sample. Patients with hyper-
kalemia that occurred after initiation of renal replacement
treatment were not included. When hyperkalemia devel-
oped during treatment with RAS blockade, three kinds of
clinical practice patterns were recognized contingent on the
maintenance of RAS blockade: 1) discontinuation of RAS
blockade; and 2) reduction or 3) maintenance of doses of
RAS blockade with supportive management for potassium
reduction. Patients were categorized as the maintenance
group if they were maintained on RAS blockade without
discontinuation of drugs, and as the withdrawal group if
RAS blockade had been discontinued for >3 months after
development of hyperkalemia. The criteria for maintenance
of RAS blockers were not specified. Maintenance or with-
drawal of RAS blockades were decided according to indi-
vidual physicians.
Outcome endpoints
The main outcomes were a doubling of the baseline serum
creatinine concentration and ESRD. ESRD was defined as
initiation of renal replacement therapy including permanent
hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or renal transplantation.
In addition, incidence of hyperkalemia and hyperkalemia-
related hospitalization were also evaluated during the fol-
low-up period.
Statistical analysis
SPSS, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA)
was used to perform statistical analysis. Continuous vari-
ables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and
categorical variables were expressed as percentages.
T-test and chi-square test were used for comparison of
the two groups. The Kolmogorov­Smirnov test was used
for analysis of the normality of the distribution of param-
eters. Cumulative renal survival curves were derived
using the Kaplan­Meier method, and differences between
survival curves were compared using the log-rank test.
Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used
for determination of risk factors for renal outcomes.
Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
were calculated using the estimated regression coeffi-
cients and standard errors in the Cox regression analysis;
a p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Baseline characteristics
The baseline demographic, clinical and biochemical data of
study subjects are shown in Table 1. The mean age of
patients was 61.8±14.5 years, and 145 patients (56%) were
male. The mean eGFR and UPCR were 29.0±13.1 ml/
min/1.73m2 and 2.3±3.0 mg/mg, respectively. Based on
maintenance of RAS blocker, 150 (58.1%) of 258 patients
were maintained on RAS blockades; however, 108 patients
were discontinued for more than 3 months. Most of the
patients in the maintenance group were maintained on the
previous dose of RAS blockers, and the dose of RAS block-
ers was reduced in 41/150 patients (27.3%). There were no
significant differences in underlying renal diseases, serum
potassium levels, eGFR, or UPCR ratio at baseline between
the two groups.
Renal outcomes
During a mean follow-up period of 45.7±18.3 months, 129
(50%) patients reached the primary outcome. ESRD or
doubling of serum creatinine occurred in 68 (63%) patients
in the withdrawal group compared with 61 (41%) patients
in the maintenance group. Renal survival rate was signifi-
cantly higher in the maintenance group compared with the
withdrawal group (p=0.04, HR in the withdrawal group:
1.35, 95% CI: 1.08­1.92). In subgroup analysis based on
the levels of baseline proteinuria, prognostic significance
between two groups was much greater in subgroup of
patients with UPCR above 1.0 (p=0.02, Figure 2). At base-
line, serum creatinine levels were similar; however, after 18
months, serum creatinine levels were significantly lower in
the maintenance group compared with the withdrawal
group (p=0.03, Figure 3).
In multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, use of
RAS blockers still remained a significant prognostic factor
for renal survival. However, after adjusting for baseline
proteinuria (HR; 1.028, p<0.01) and baseline GFR (HR;
1.248, p<0.01), the significance of RAS blocker mainte-
nance as a predictor of renal progression disappeared
(HR=1.135, CI; 0.937­1.546, p=0.17) (Table 2).
Incidence of hyperkalemia and follow-up
clinical outcomes
Baseline potassium levels were 5.79±0.38 mmol/l versus
5.77±0.48 mmol/l in the maintenance and withdrawal
groups. During the follow-up period, 0.58 episodes per
494 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)
patient-year of hyperkalemia occurred in the maintenance
group, and 0.47 episodes per patient-year developed in the
withdrawal group (p=0.19). In addition, neither hyper-
kalemia-related hospitalizations nor mortality differed
between the two groups (0.18 episodes per patient-year vs.
0.14 episodes per patient-year, p=0.42). At the end of the
study, potassium levels were 5.39±0.52 mmol/l versus
5.23±0.61 mmol/l in maintenance and withdrawal groups
(p=0.14). Blood pressures at various time points during the
follow-up period are listed in Table 3. The blood pressures
in the two groups were comparable during the follow-up
period. During the follow-up period, 17 patients (11 patients
in the maintenance group and six patients in the withdrawal
group) died, and mortality rate was not different between
two groups. One patient in each group died due to hyper-
kalemia-related events.
Discussion
This study demonstrated that maintenance of RAS block-
ade is beneficial for the preservation of renal function, even
in hyperkalemic CKD patients treated with RAS blocker. In
addition, cautious use of RAS blockade does not lead to a
significant increase in the episodes of hyperkalemia in
CKD patients who develop hyperkalemia during treatment
with ACEI or ARB.
Based on previous reports, long-term blockade of the
renin­angiotensin­aldosterone system by ACEIs or ARBs
resulted in increased levels of plasma renin or angiotensin
II.13 In addition, occurrence of aldosterone breakthrough
has been also reported during long-term ARB therapy,
mainly by angiotensin II-dependent mechanisms.14 Since
renin or angiotensin II levels are already elevated in condi-
tions of chronic blocking of the RAS, it is possible that
renal failure and hypertension might be aggravated due to
the abrupt disappearance of the RAS-blocking effect.
Blocking of RAS might be maintained in order to prevent
rebound hypertension and progression of renal failure. Our
data support that maintenance of RAS blockade rather than
withdrawal is beneficial for the preservation of renal func-
tion in CKD patients who have accompanying hyper-
kalemia during RAS blockade treatment.
The renoprotective effect of the RAS blocker was much
more prominent in the subgroup with a baseline UPCR
ratio of more than 1 mg/mg. This finding is consistent with
previous studies, indicating an association of a higher uri-
nary protein excretion rate with a rapid decline rate in renal
function,8 and ACEI has a distinguishable renoprotective
effect in patients with baseline proteinuria of 3 g/day or
more.3 The present study suggests that maintenance of RAS
blockade should be considered in highly proteinuric CKD
patients.
In patients with CKD, development of hyperkalemia fre-
quently occurs due to various causes such as reduced renal
excretion of potassium or metabolic acidosis.15­17 Besides
discontinuation of RAS blockade, various approaches should
be considered. Potassium imbalance might be treatable by
restricting potassium intake and correction of underlying
causes, while maintaining treatment with RAS blockade. A
previous study showed that most of the patients with

alone or with dietary advice and decrease in dose of the
ACEI.18 Although the incidences of hyperkalemia after treat-
ment with ACEI or ARB in patients with CKD were highly
variable, clinical trials showed that prolonged use of RAS
blockade did not lead to an increase in additional episodes of
hyperkalemia in these patients. In addition, another study

difference in the overall mortality rate among patients on
ACEI/ARB therapy, compared with patients on placebo or
conventional anti-hypertensive drugs.3,4,7,19 The present
study also demonstrated that the incidence of hyperkalemia,
as well as hyperkalemia-related hospitalization in study sub-
jects, was similar in both groups whether or not RAS block-
ade had been maintained. Therefore, maintenance of the
RAS blocker with careful monitoring, rather than only dis-
continuing RAS blockade, could be applied.
This study has several limitations. Because its design is
retrospective, this study may include sampling errors.
There may be potential selection errors because mainte-
nance of RAS blockade was decided by individual physi-
cians. However, there are no specific guidelines and
outcomes regarding whether use of RAS blocker is benefi-
cial, due to a lack of appropriate guidelines. In addition,
due to safety and ethical issues, it would be difficult to con-
duct a prospective study using RAS blockade in CKD
patients who have hyperkalemia. Thus, in spite of the retro-
spective nature of the current study, we think that the study
results are still valuable. Second, even though other drugs
and conditions may have had an influence on serum potas-
sium levels, these and dietary potassium intake were not
evaluated. Therefore, further large-scale analysis is needed
in order to confirm the risk and benefit of RAS blockade in
this special population.
In conclusion, the renoprotective effects of RAS block-
ade in CKD patients with hyperkalemia disappeared after
withdrawing RAS blockade. The results of the current
study suggest that maintenance of RAS blockade retards
the progression of renal failure, and these beneficial effects
are more prominent in proteinuric CKD patients. In addi-
tion, ACEI/ARB is well tolerated in stage III or IV CKD
patients with hyperkalemia occurring during treatment with
RAS blockade.
