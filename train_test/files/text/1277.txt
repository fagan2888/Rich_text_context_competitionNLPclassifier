Abstract
LI, CHAOYANG, EARL S. FORD, LISA C. MCGUIRE,
AND ALI H. MOKDAD. Increasing trends in waist
circumference and abdominal obesity among U.S. adults.
Obesity. 2007;15:216­224.
Objective: Some studies have shown that abdominal obesity
may be a better predictor than overall obesity for disease
risks and all-cause mortality. This study sought to examine
the recent trends in waist circumference (WC) among adults
in the United States.
Research Methods and Procedures: Data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 1988­
1994, 1999­2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­2004 were ana-
lyzed to estimate the trends in the mean WC and the
prevalence of abdominal obesity. Pooled t tests were used to
test the differences in estimates between two time periods.
Results: Between the periods of 1988­1994 and 2003­
2004, the age-adjusted mean WC increased from 96.0 cm to
100.4 cm among men (p  0.001) and from 89.0 cm to 94.0
cm among women (p  0.001); the age-adjusted prevalence
of abdominal obesity increased from 29.5% to 42.4%
among men (p  0.001) and from 47.0% to 61.3% among
women (p  0.001). Between the periods of 1999­2000 and
2003­2004, a significant increase occurred in mean WC
only among men (from 99.0 cm to 100.4 cm; p  0.03) and
in the prevalence of abdominal obesity among both men
(from 37.0% to 42.2%; p  0.03) and women (from 55.3%
to 61.3%; p  0.04). People with a BMI of 25 to 29 kg/m2
had a greater relative increase in abdominal obesity.
Discussion: The mean WC and the prevalence of abdominal
obesity among U.S. adults have increased continuously
during the past 15 years. Over one-half of U.S. adults had
abdominal obesity in the period of 2003­2004.

Introduction
Abdominal fat deposition is a key component of obesity
(1). Some, but not all, studies have shown that waist cir-
cumference (WC)1 may be a better predictor for the risk of
myocardial infarction (2), type 2 diabetes (3), metabolic
syndrome (4), medical care costs (5), and all-cause mortal-
ity (6) than BMI. WC is a simple and convenient way of
measuring abdominal or central obesity (7) and is a major
determinant of the National Cholesterol Education Program
Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) (8) and Inter-
national Diabetes Federation (9) criteria for the definition
and diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. WC has been pro-
posed to be routinely used as part of clinical cardiovascular
risk assessments and interpretation of obesity-related health
risks (10). In fact, the NIH recommends that WC be mea-
sured, especially in people with a BMI of 25.0 to 34.9 kg/m2
(11).
Although the prevalence of overall obesity as measured
by BMI is well-documented and it has increased dramati-
cally in the past 2 decades in the United States (12,13), little
is known about the secular trends in abdominal obesity.
Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) III and NHANES 1999­2000 have
shown an increase in mean WC and prevalence of high-risk
WC among U.S. adults (14). This study extends the report
by Ford et al. (14) and uses the most recent national data for
the periods of 2001­2002 and 2003­2004 to examine the
recent secular trends in mean WC and the prevalence of
abdominal obesity from NHANES III (1988­1994) to
NHANES 2003­2004 and from NHANES 1999­2000 to
NHANES 2003­2004 among U.S. adults.

Research Methods and Procedures
Study Design
This study examined data from the NHANES conducted
at four periods: 1988­1994 (15), 1999­2000 (16), 2001­
2002 (17), and 2003­2004 (18). In NHANES, participants
were selected using a multistage, stratified sampling design
and were considered representative of the civilian, non-
institutionalized U.S. population. Persons 60 years of age,
African Americans, and Mexican Americans were over-
sampled. After being interviewed in their homes, the par-
ticipants were invited to attend one of three examination
sessions (morning, afternoon, or evening) in a mobile ex-
amination center.
Measurements
Body measurements of survey participants were taken
using standardized methods and equipment. For all mea-
sures, NHANES participants wore underwear, disposable
paper gowns, paper pants, and foam rubber slippers. WC
was measured using a steel measuring tape to the nearest 0.1
cm at the high point of the iliac crest at minimal respiration
(15­18). Weight was measured on a Toledo self-zeroing
weight scale (Mettler-Toledo, Columbus, OH), and height
was measured with a stadiometer to the nearest millimeter.
BMI was calculated from measured weight and height and
was categorized into three groups (normal, 25 kg/m2;
overweight, 25 to 29.9 kg/m2; and obese, 30 kg/m2),
according to World Health Organization criteria (19). Other
variables included in the analyses were sex, age, race/
ethnicity (i.e., white, African-American, Mexican-Ameri-
can, and other), and years of education.
Statistical Analysis
This study analyzed the mean WC and the prevalence of
abdominal obesity in men and non-pregnant women 20
years of age in NHANES III (1988­1994), NHANES
1999­2000, NHANES 2001­2002, and NHANES 2003­
2004. Abdominal obesity was defined as a WC of 102 cm
in men and 88 cm in women, based on criteria from the
NCEP ATP III (8). The prevalence of abdominal obesity,
defined by ethnic-specific cut-off points as proposed by the
International Diabetes Federation (9), was calculated. To
demonstrate the overall changes in the past 15 years and in
the most recent 4 years in mean WC and in the prevalence
of abdominal obesity, the total differences in the estimates
between the NHANES III (1988­1994) and NHANES
2003­2004 surveys and between NHANES 1999­2000 and
NHANES 2003­2004 were calculated. The statistical sig-
nificance of the changes was tested by using the pooled t
test (pooled t-statistic  difference in the means or propor-
tions of the two estimates divided by the pooled standard
error of the two estimates, which was calculated as the
square root of the sum of the squares of the two standard
errors). An  of 0.05 was used as the critical value of
statistical significance for the two-sided t tests. All analyses
were performed using SUDAAN software (Release 9.0;
Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) to
account for the complex sampling design and to calculate
estimates representative of the civilian, non-institutional-
ized U.S. population.
Results
Among NHANES men and non-pregnant women 20
years of age who attended the mobile examination center,
those who had a WC measure were as follows: 15,454
(83.4%) of 18,537 participants in NHANES III (1988­
1994), 4024 (87.1%) of 4621 in NHANES 1999­2000,
4437 (87.6%) of 5067 participants in NHANES 2001­2002,
and 4256 (88.5%) of 4808 participants in NHANES 2003­
2004. Between NHANES III (1988­1994) and NHANES
2003­2004, the age-adjusted mean WC increased by 4.4 cm
(1.7 inches) among men and 5.1 cm (2.0 inches) among
women (Table 1). The rate of increase was 0.34 cm/yr from
NHANES III (1988­1994) to NHANES 1999­2000 and
0.42 cm/yr from NHANES 1999­2000 to NHANES 2003­
2004.
Trends of Mean WC and the Prevalence of Abdominal
Obesity between NHANES III (1988­1994) and
NHANES 2003­2004
Among men, a steady increase occurred among all de-
mographic groups except those of "other race/ethnicity."
The largest relative increase occurred among men ages 20 to
29 years (7.3%; p  0.01), African-American men (5.2%;
p  0.01), and men with 12 years of education (5.5%; p 
0.01). Among women, an increase occurred among all de-
mographic subgroups but was of borderline significance
among women ages 50 to 59 years and was not statistically
significant among women of "other race/ethnicity." The
greatest increase occurred among women ages 20 to 29
years (10.0%; p  0.01), African-American women (6.3%;
p  0.01), and women with 12 years of education (7.6%;
p  0.01).
Over one-half of U.S. adults had abdominal obesity in the
period of 2003­2004. The age-adjusted prevalence of ab-
dominal obesity (102 cm in men and 88 cm in women)
increased from NHANES III (1988­1994) to NHANES
2003­2004 by 43.4% (p  0.01) in men and 30.5% (p 
0.01) in women (Table 2). This prevalence significantly
increased in all demographic subgroups except men ages 50
to 59 years and both men and women of "other race/
ethnicity." The overall average prevalence of abdominal
obesity during 1999 and 2002 was 47.3% for total, 38.0%
for men, 40.5% for white men, 30.9% for African-American
men, 34.9% for Mexican-American men, 56.2% for women,
53.5% for white women, 70.0% for African-American
women, and 63.3% for Mexican-American women.

OBESITY Vol. 15 No. 1 January 2007 219
Among men, the largest relative increase in the age-
adjusted prevalence of abdominal obesity occurred among
individuals ages 20 to 29 years (100.0%), white men (47.8%),
and men who had 12 years of education (60.6%). Among
women, the largest relative increase in the age-adjusted
prevalence of abdominal obesity occurred among individu-
als ages 20 to 29 years (81.6%), white women (31.9%), and
women with 12 years of education (48.7%). Similar in-
creasing trends in the prevalence of abdominal obesity
defined by using ethnic-specific cut-off values for WC
suggested by the International Diabetes Federation were
observed (see Appendix).
To examine whether the increase in WC reflected a
general increase in body weight rather than a specific in-
crease in abdominal adiposity, we examined the change
in mean WC (Figure 1) and in prevalence of abdominal
obesity (Figure 2) by three categories of BMI. Among both
men and women, significant increases in mean WC were
found in all three BMI categories. Both men and women
with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 had the largest increase in mean
WC. In contrast, a significant increase in the prevalence of
abdominal obesity was found only among men with a BMI
of 25 to 29 kg/m2 (31.2%; p  0.001), whereas a signifi-
cant increase was found in each of the BMI categories

Trends of Mean WC and the Prevalence of Abdominal
Obesity between NHANES 1999­2000 and NHANES
2003­2004
An overall increase of 1.5% and 2.0% in mean age-
adjusted WC occurred for men and women, respectively
(Table 1). Among men, the largest relative increase oc-
curred among people ages 20 to 29 years (2.4%; p  0.08),
African Americans (2.8%; p  0.02), and men with 12
years of education (2.4%; p  0.01). In contrast, among
women, the greatest increase occurred among people ages
40 to 49 years (3.5%; p  0.11), Mexican Americans (4.6%;
p  0.01), and people with 12 years of education (3.6%;
p  0.02).
The age-adjusted prevalence of abdominal obesity in-
creased by 14.6% (p  0.03) in men and 10.9% (p  0.04)
in women (Table 2). The largest relative increase occurred
among men ages 40 to 49 years (32.0%; p  0.02), white
men (16.6%; p  0.02), and men who had 12 years of
education (26.6%; p  0.01), women 80 years of age
(26.6%; p  0.01), Mexican-American women (23.7%; p 
0.01), and women with 12 years of education (18.9%; p 
0.01).
Significant increases in mean WC were found only
among men with a BMI of 25 to 29 kg/m2 (1.0%; p  0.03),
women with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 (2.3%; p  0.05), and
women with a BMI of 25 to 29 kg/m2 (2.2%; p  0.01)
(Figure 1). In addition, a significant increase in the preva-
lence of abdominal obesity was found only among men
(22.5%; p  0.05) and women (23.5%; p  0.01) with a
BMI of 25 to 29 kg/m2 (Figure 2).
Discussion
The most recent data of NHANES 2001­2002 and 2003­
2004 provide evidence of a continuing increase in the mean
WC and in prevalence of abdominal obesity among U.S.
adults compared with the data of NHANES III (1988­1994)
and NHANES 1999­2000 (14). The rate of increase during
the periods of 1999­2000 and 2003­2004 continued un-
abated, compared with the previous years. The percentage
of U.S. adults who have abdominal obesity as defined by
criteria from the NCEP ATP III is considerably larger than
the percentage of participants with overall obesity as de-
fined by a BMI of 30 kg/m2 (12,13). Especially troubling
is the statistic that, on average, more than one-half of U.S.
adults had abdominal obesity, as reported for the first time
in 2003­2004. Our results are of particular concern because
visceral adiposity, which WC reasonably represents, is
thought to especially increase the risk for obesity-associated
morbidity and mortality. Increases in energy intake (20),
despite recent declines in the prevalence of inactivity (21),
likely contributed to the secular trends in mean WC and in
prevalence of abdominal obesity.
As the epidemic of overall obesity measured by BMI
increased (12,13), the prevalence of abdominal obesity as
measured by WC correspondingly increased. However, the
rates and demographic patterns of such an increase in over-
all obesity and abdominal obesity may differ. Recent data
indicate that the relative increase in the prevalence of over-
all obesity as measured by BMI was 7.3% for men and 8.0%
for women between the periods of 1988­1994 and 1999­
2000 (12) and was 13.1% for men and 0.6% for women
between the periods of 1999­2000 and 2003­2004 (13). In
contrast, the relative increase in abdominal obesity at the
same periods seemed to be much larger (43.4% and 14.6%
for men; 30.5% and 10.9% for women, respectively) than
that in overall obesity, as evidenced in our study. Further-
more, as shown in our study, the total relative increase from
1988­1994 to 2003­2004 in the prevalence of abdominal
obesity seemed to be more pronounced among men and
women ages 20 to 29 years and among both men and
women with a BMI of 25 to 29 kg/m2. Between the periods
1999­2000 and 2003­2004, the largest relative increase
was observed among men ages 40 to 49 years and women
80 years of age. In contrast, the largest increase in overall
obesity, as defined by a BMI of 30 kg/m2, occurred
among men and women ages 60 to 69 years between the
periods of 1988­1994 and 1999­2000 (12), and among
men and women ages 40 to 59 years between the periods of
1999­2000 and 2003­2004 (13).
The total increase in WC during the past 15 years seemed
to be larger and more significant than that during the most
recent 4 years, which gave an impression that the total
increase might be largely attributable to the change in the
earlier period. In fact, the rate of increase from 1999­2000
to 2003­2004 (0.42 cm/yr) was slightly larger that that from
1988­1994 to 1999­2000 (0.34 cm/yr). Small changes in
mean WC among women during the periods of 1999­2000
and 2003­2004 were of borderline significance, but the
resulting changes in the prevalence of abdominal obesity
were larger and statistically significant. Because we used a
cut-off value of 88 cm to define abdominal obesity in
women and the mean WC in the recent NHANES surveys
was near this threshold, it was likely that a small increase in
WC could lead to a large increase in the prevalence of
abdominal obesity.
Although the overall unadjusted and age-adjusted
changes in WC during the periods of 1999­2000 and 2003­
2004 were significant, the age-specific changes were mostly
not significant. In part, this is attributable to the smaller
numbers of participants in each age group and, in part, to
small changes in WC in some age groups in this short period
of time. In almost all instances, whites had the highest
prevalence of abdominal obesity among men, and African
Increasing Abdominal Obesity in U.S. Adults, Li et al.
OBESITY Vol. 15 No. 1 January 2007 221
Americans had the highest prevalence of abdominal obesity
among women. Given the high baseline prevalence of ab-
dominal obesity for these two groups in 1988­1994, it is
disconcerting that these two groups experienced either the
highest (47.8% for white men) or second highest (23.2% for
African-American women) relative increases. Thus, these
two groups may be at particularly high risk for any future
obesity-associated complications. In contrast, both African-
American men and women had the highest prevalence of
overall obesity and the largest relative increases between the
periods of 1988­1994 and 1999­2000 (12) and between the
periods of 1999­2000 and 2003­2004 (13).
Although women showed a clear inverse relationship
between educational attainment and the prevalence of ab-
dominal obesity, men did not. However, among both sexes,
a direct relationship occurred between educational attain-
ment and relative increases in abdominal obesity. It is
unclear why people with a higher education level tended to
have a greater increase in the prevalence of abdominal
obesity. To the extent that educational attainment reflects
socioeconomic status, the expected relationships between
socioeconomic status and obesity seem to be attenuating in
recent NHANES surveys.
Interestingly, significant increases in the prevalence of
abdominal obesity seemed to be more pronounced within
the group with BMI values of 25 to 29 kg/m2 than within
other BMI groups for both men and women. Additional
analyses showed that the mean BMI of each NHANES
survey was similar for each of the three BMI groups.
Therefore, the larger increase in abdominal obesity in this
specific group may not be related to the change in BMI. One
possible explanation may be attributable to the use of a
cut-off point of 102 cm for men and 88 cm for women to
define abdominal obesity. Because the mean WC in the
group with BMI values of 25 to 29 kg/m2 is closer to the
cut-off point than those of the other two groups, people in
this BMI group are more likely to exceed the thresholds to
be defined as abdominal obesity when their WC increases.
Nevertheless, further research is needed to examine the root
causes that lead to differential trends of abdominal and
overall obesity.
Our results highlight the critical need to understand the
secular trends in abdominal obesity in the United States.
Increasing evidence indicates that abdominal obesity as
measured by WC may be more important than the overall
obesity as measured by BMI in predicting all-cause mortal-
ity and morbidity of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases
(2­4,6). In addition, WC may be superior to BMI in mea-
suring abdominal adiposity (22). Furthermore, a combina-
tion of BMI and WC may provide a better prediction of
obesity-related mortality and morbidity than BMI or WC
alone (23). As shown in a recent study, relative to the
normal-weight category (BMI 18.5 to 25 kg/m2), obesity
(BMI 30 kg/m2) was positively associated with total mor-
tality, but overweight (BMI 25 to 29 kg/m2) was inversely
associated with total mortality (24). It is unknown whether
this counterintuitive finding among people with a BMI of 25
to 29 kg/m2 in this study is attributable to lean body mass.
In fact, lean body mass is inversely related to all-cause
mortality (25). Therefore, monitoring the changing trend of
abdominal obesity may provide additional information for
more accurately predicting all-cause and obesity-related
mortality and morbidity and an opportunity for intervention
in clinical practice and public health campaigns. Because
relatively few health care professionals routinely measure
WC, efforts are needed to promote the measurement of this
important anthropometric parameter as a "vital sign" in
primary care practice.
In summary, the results from our analyses provide an
updated look at the trends in WC and abdominal obesity in
the United States. Mean WC increased among all sociode-
mographic groups examined in this report. Increases in
abdominal obesity were particularly striking among over-
weight men and women (BMI 25 to 29 kg/m2). Previous
studies showing that increased mortality risk related to
excess body fat was due mainly to abdominal adiposity (6)
raise potential concerns about how the increases in the
prevalence of abdominal obesity that we demonstrated may
affect future adverse health outcomes in the United States.
