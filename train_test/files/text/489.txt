Abundant evidence from prospective cohort studies of youth has
indicated that the symptoms of depression emerge in childhood
and adolescence.1­6 The symptomatic manifestations of
depression in both clinical and community studies of adolescents
resemble the presentation found among adults.7­9 Developmental
differences in the symptoms of depression may nevertheless
exist,10 and there is some evidence that behavioural and somatic
symptoms may be more prominent, and psychomotor symptoms
less common, among children and adolescents.7,8,11­13 Based on
the widespread consensus regarding the heterogeneity of major
depression,14,15 there have been numerous efforts to identify
distinct subtypes of major depression based on characteristics
such as symptom clusters, age at onset, family history and
course.16­18 A comprehensive overview of different subtyping
models of depression, including models based on aetiology,
symptoms, time of onset, gender and treatment response, was
recently published by Baumeister & Parker.19 Statistical
approaches such as factor analysis and latent class analysis
(LCA) of data from both clinical and community samples of
adults have shown that subtypes of depression were best
discriminated by both severity and symptom profiles.20,21 Studies
of adults have found differences in treatment response,22,23
biological correlates,24­26 and course and stability of disorder,27,28
between the various subtypes, particularly the melancholic and
atypical subtypes specified in DSM-IV.
Despite abundant efforts to identify depression subtypes in
adults, there has been little research on the expression of
distinct subtypes of depression in adolescents.29 To date, studies
using LCA to examine subtypes of depression have been limited
to adult samples. Accordingly, the three goals of our study were
to investigate the subtypes of major depressive disorder in a
representative sample of US adolescents using LCA; to test the
comparability of this structure across two nationally representative
samples of adolescents and adults; and to examine socio-
demographic and clinical correlates of derived subtypes across
samples.
Method
The National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) is a
nationally representative community household survey of 9282
non-institutionalised adults aged 18 years and over in the
USA.30 Face-to-face interviews were held at the respondents'
homes between February 2001 and April 2003. The National
Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A) is an
extension of the NCS-R that included young people aged 13­18
years who resided in the homes of NCS-R participants (n = 879)
and an additional school-based sample of young people
(n = 9244), yielding a total of 10 123 adolescents.31,32 Interviews
were conducted between February 2001 and January 2004. The
Human Subjects Committees of Harvard Medical School and
the University of Michigan approved all NCS-R and NCS-A
procedures, and all participants gave informed consent prior to
the interview.
All respondents with a 12-month major depressive disorder
from NCS-A (n = 912) and NCS-R (n = 805) were selected
for the analyses. We used 12-month disorders because

Background
Although techniques such as latent class analysis have been
used to derive empirically based subtypes of depression in
adult samples, there is limited information on subtypes of
depression in youth.
Aims
To identify empirically based subtypes of depression in a
nationally representative sample of US adolescents, and to
test the comparability of subtypes of depression in
adolescents with those derived from a nationally
representative sample of adults.
Method
Respondents included 912 adolescents and 805 adults
with a 12-month major depressive disorder, selected
from the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent
Supplement and the National Comorbidity Survey
Replication samples respectively. Latent class analysis
was used to identify subtypes of depression across
samples. Sociodemographic and clinical correlates of
derived subtypes were also examined to establish their
validity.
Results
Three subtypes of depression were identified among
adolescents, whereas four subtypes were identified among
adults. Two of these subtypes displayed similar diagnostic
profiles across adolescent and adult samples (P = 0.43); these
subtypes were labelled `severe typical' (adults 45%,
adolescents 35%) and `atypical' (adults 16%, adolescents
26%). The latter subtype was characterised by increased
appetite and weight gain.
Conclusions
The structure of depression observed in adolescents is highly
similar to the structure observed in adults. Longitudinal
research is necessary to evaluate the stability of these
subtypes of depression across development.

individuals without a current diagnosis may have more
problems in accurately recalling their symptoms of
depression. A non-hierarchical definition of major depressive
disorder was used, in order to allow assessment of psychiatric
comorbidity.
Measures
The World Health Organization's Composite International
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) version 3.0 was used for diagnostic
assessment of psychiatric disorders.33 The CIDI is a fully
structured interview administered by trained lay interviewers to
generate DSM-IV diagnoses. The NCS-A used a modified version
of the CIDI used in NCS-R for diagnostic assessment of
psychiatric disorders.34
Depressive symptoms
We included the nine DSM-IV symptoms of depression listed
in the CIDI but separated weight changes from appetite
changes, yielding a total of ten symptoms. All variables were coded
as present or absent; however, variables for changes in weight,
appetite, sleep and psychomotor activity included a further
distinction between weight loss/gain, increased/decreased appetite,
insomnia/hypersomnia and activation/retardation, leading to
variables with three categories to better capture the differences
in symptom profiles.
Characteristics to describe latent classes
Sociodemographic variables including gender and age were
collected in both surveys. Clinical characteristics included number
of depressive symptoms, number of episodes and age at onset,
derived from the CIDI; severity, measured with a modified version
of the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology;35 and
12-month comorbidity with DSM-IV psychiatric disorders
assessed in the CIDI (mania, hypomania, dysthymia, generalised
anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social phobia, agoraphobia,
specific phobia, substance use disorder, any binge eating disorder).
Family histories of depression and mania were assessed. Further,
we collected information on treatment in the past year for
emotional or behavioural problems. We created variables to
indicate whether participants had received any mental healthcare
(out-patient mental health clinic, mental health professional, drug
or alcohol clinic, admission to psychiatric hospital or other mental
health facility) and any mental or medical healthcare (general
medical care, any mental healthcare, and any school services for
the NCS-A sample) during the previous year.
Several functional and health indicators were used to
describe latent classes. The World Health Organization Disability
Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS) was used to assess functional
impairment during the past month (NCS-R only),36 and we
created a dichotomous variable indicating which participants
had severe or very severe disability (defined as scoring more
than 6 on a scale of 0­10, based on the Sheehan Disability Scale37).
We calculated body mass index (BMI) in kg/m2 based on self-
reported weight and height. Presence of somatic disorders was
based on chronic conditions assessed in the US National Health
Interview Survey.38 Respondents were asked whether they had
ever experienced each of the conditions in this checklist. We
included the following conditions: heart attack and heart
disease (NCS-R only), diabetes or high blood glucose level,
high blood pressure (NCS-R only), migraine, and other
headaches.
Statistical analysis
Latent class analyses were performed using Mplus version 6.1 for
Windows.39 In LCA it is assumed that an unobserved, latent
categorical variable (i.e. class) explains the association among a
set of observed variables (i.e. symptoms). It computes two sets
of parameters: latent class probabilities or prevalences, and
conditional probabilities (estimated probabilities of observed
variables given that the individual is a member of that class).
Ten categorical variables measuring depressive symptoms (as
described earlier) served as latent class indicators, and models
with one to five classes were estimated. The final model was
chosen based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC, smallest
value preferred), the sample size-adjusted BIC (smallest value
preferred), entropy (highest value preferred) and interpretability
of the derived classes.40­42 Respondents were assigned to their
most likely class based on posterior probabilities, classes were
given subjective labels based on symptom probabilities, and
correlates of classes were then evaluated in SAS version 9.2
(SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA) for Windows,
separately for adolescents and adults. Class comparisons within
samples were performed for correlates with a significant main
effect (P50.05), and further post hoc tests examined differences
between NCS-A and NCA-R classes. All analyses corrected
for the complex sampling design and were weighted to adjust
for differential probabilities of selection, non-response and
post-stratification.

Depressive disorder in US adolescents and adults
Model selection
In the NCS-A sample both the BIC and the sample size-adjusted
BIC were smallest in the three-class model, which was therefore
chosen as the final model. In the NCS-R sample the BIC was
smallest in a three-class model, whereas the four-class model
yielded the smallest sample size-adjusted BIC and higher entropy
than the three-class model (Table 2); additionally, the four-class
model more closely approximated subtypes identified in previous
research,20,21,43 and the current distinctions between atypical and
typical depressive disorder subtypes in the DSM-IV. The four-class
model was therefore chosen in the adult sample.
Class description
Adolescents
In the adolescent sample (NCS-A) the first class identified was
labelled `moderate typical' (prevalence 39.9%) owing to a typical
symptom pattern characterised by decreased appetite and
insomnia (Fig. 1). This class had the lowest proportion of young
people with suicidal thoughts. The second class was labelled
`severe typical' (prevalence 34.6%) owing to a typical symptom
pattern including weight loss, and higher symptom probabilities
than the `moderate typical' class. The third class was labelled
`atypical' (prevalence 25.5%) as it presented an atypical symptom
pattern marked by increased appetite and weight gain.
Adults
In the NCS-R sample the first class was characterised by few
changes in appetite or weight and psychomotor changes, and
had a prevalence of 14.6%. This class was labelled `moderate'
owing to its moderately severe symptom pattern (Fig. 2). The
second class, labelled `moderate typical' because of its typical
symptom pattern including weight loss, decreased appetite and
insomnia, had a prevalence of 24.8%. The third class, `severe
typical' (prevalence 44.9%) had a typical symptom pattern but
higher symptom probabilities and proportions of adults with
insomnia and suicidal thoughts than the `moderate typical' class.
The fourth class, `atypical' (prevalence 15.6%), had a distinct
pattern of increased appetite and weight gain.
Comparison of adults and adolescents
We performed additional multiple-group LCA simultaneously in
NCS-A and NCS-R samples to test whether the observed class
symptom profiles were similar across the samples. For this
purpose, we ran an unrestricted model and a restricted model
using the KNOWNCLASS-option in Mplus, and performed a
72 log-likelihood test. In the unrestricted model all parameters
were estimated freely, whereas in the restricted model the
probabilities of symptoms within classes were held equal across
samples. Because the NCS-R sample had four classes and the
NCS-A sample only three, we used a restriction to fix the
prevalence of the additional NCS-R class to zero in the NCS-A
sample. These analyses showed that the restricted model, where
all three classes were held equal, was significantly different from
the unrestricted model (P = 0.03), but a model restricting only
two classes was not significantly different (P = 0.43). These results
indicate that the symptom profiles of the severe typical and
atypical (but not the moderate typical) classes were the same
across samples. Comparison of the prevalence rates of the adult
severe typical and adult atypical classes with the prevalence rates
of their adolescent counterparts showed that these rates differed
significantly, with adolescents having a higher rate of the atypical
subtype and a lower rate of severe typical subtype.
Correlates
Adolescents
The sociodemographic, clinical and health correlates of the
identified subtypes are presented in Tables 3 and 4. In adolescents,
the atypical class had the highest proportion of female
participants, and between-class differences were statistically
significant. No other difference in demographic variables was
observed. The number of symptoms was significantly higher in
the severe typical class compared with the other two classes, but
symptom severity was highest in the atypical class and
significantly higher than in the moderate typical class. The
proportions of adolescents with a positive family history of
depression were significantly different between the adolescent
classes, with both the severe typical and atypical classes having a
higher proportion of young people with a positive family history
relative to the moderate class.
Agoraphobia was differentially distributed across classes, with
the severe typical class having double the prevalence rate of
agoraphobia compared with the other two classes. Further, rates
of any binge eating disorder were highest in the atypical class
and lowest in the moderate class. No difference in treatment
was observed across adolescent classes. In terms of health
indicators, no difference in disability was found, but the atypical
class had the highest BMI, and this was significantly higher than
the moderate typical class. The percentage of adolescents who
were overweight or obese (based on BMI z-score, 485th
percentile) was also highest in the atypical group (45.6% v.
36.4­39.7%).
Adults
In the adult sample, the proportion of women increased with
increasing severity of classes. The highest proportion of women
was found in the atypical class, and this proportion was
significantly higher relative to all other classes. There were
significant differences between classes in the number of symptoms
present, with the severe typical class having the highest mean
number of symptoms, followed by the atypical class. Severity
scores for depression were also higher in the severe typical and
atypical classes. Differences in number of episodes between classes
were found, with the moderate typical class having the fewest
episodes. This class further had the highest percentage of adults
with early disorder onset (512 years of age), whereas the
moderate class had the lowest percentage of adults with early
onset. No difference was found in family history of depression,
but the severe typical class more frequently had a family history
of mania than the moderate class.

With respect to comorbid disorders, there was a significant
difference between classes in mania, with the highest rates
observed in the atypical class. Hypomania was significantly
different across adult classes, with the highest rate in the severe
typical class and the lowest in the atypical class. Social phobia,
agoraphobia and specific phobia were all significantly different
across latent classes; highest prevalence rates for these disorders
were observed in the severe typical class. Those in the atypical class
were most likely to have received any healthcare, and those in the
severe typical class were most likely to have received any mental
healthcare in the previous year.
Body mass index significantly differed across adult classes,
with the atypical class having a significantly higher BMI than all
other classes and also having the highest percentage of people with
a BMI greater than 25 kg/m2 (77.6% v. 54.2­59.2% in other
subtypes). The WHO-DAS health functioning scale further
showed highest disability in the severe typical class. Severity of
the severe typical class was also distinguished by disability, with

Comparison of correlates in adolescents and adults
Several similarities were observed between the adolescent and
adult samples. In both samples the proportion of female
participants was highest in the atypical class and was similar
across samples (P = 0.88). In both samples the number of
symptoms was highest in the severe typical class and the symptom
severity score was highest in the atypical class. Comparisons of
similar classes between adolescents and adults revealed no
significant difference in number of symptoms and symptom
severity between classes (data not shown). In both samples, BMI
was highest in the atypical class, and there was no observed
difference in chronic conditions. There were, however, several
differences in correlates between the adolescent and adult samples:
differences in number of episodes, age at onset and treatment
between classes were observed only in the adult sample.
Discussion
This study provides novel information on the structure of
depression in nationally representative samples of US adolescents
and adults. The subtypes identified in these analyses suggest that
both symptom patterns and severity of depressive symptoms are
sources of heterogeneity in major depressive disorder. The central
importance of symptoms that are somatic in quality (such as
changes in appetite, weight, sleep and fatigue) in discriminating
depressive subtypes has major implications for our understanding
of the biologic pathways, treatment and opportunities for
prevention of the consequences of this major public health
problem in American youth. As in previous work,8,11,13 our results
indicate that the structure of depression is largely similar across
adolescent and adult age groups. Among adolescents, three
distinct subtypes of depression were derived: one defined by a
typical symptom presentation and moderate severity (moderate
typical), one characterised by a typical symptom presentation
and high severity (severe typical) and a third marked by an

atypical symptom pattern, including increased appetite, weight
gain and fatigue (atypical). The structure of depression among
adults displayed more heterogeneity, with four subtypes instead
of the three found in adolescents. Two of the three subtypes in
adolescents ­ severe typical and atypical ­ had symptom patterns
identical to those in adults. Although the more complex
presentation of depression in adults could illustrate developmental
changes in depression parallel to those witnessed in the transition
between childhood and adolescence,44 it could also be in part an
artefact of the lack of a clear-cut distinction between the moderate
typical and moderate classes.
Subtypes and correlates
Our findings further confirm prior classification studies that have
demonstrated the importance of inclusion of a severity
component in subtyping depression in both adults and
adolescents.14,20,21 Compared with moderate groups, the severe
groups were distinguished by a greater number of depressive
symptoms, number of depressive episodes, symptom severity,
treatment and role impairment in both adults and young people.
Evidence for distinctions between subgroups by severity highlights
the importance of implementing a dimensional severity rating for
improving depression diagnosis. Aside from severity, the subtypes
were also distinguished by differential symptom profiles. The
typical subtype was the most prevalent subtype (approximately
70%) in both adults and adolescents. Although we did not assess
all melancholic symptoms, the severe typical subtype that we
identified was characterised by the core features of melancholia
including more loss of appetite and weight loss, psychomotor
change and feelings of guilt (the latter being more pronounced

Depressive disorder in US adolescents and adults
in the adult sample). Typical/melancholic subtypes have also
been identified in several LCA studies in the USA and The
Netherlands.20,21
The atypical subtype, demonstrated in numerous clinical and
community samples of adults,12­23 has not previously been
examined in community studies of adolescents.45,46 The
prevalence of the atypical subtype in adults with depression
(16%) was similar to that in one prior LCA study,20 but somewhat
higher than has been generally found in other studies. However,
the much higher prevalence of the subtype in adolescents with
depression (26%) was well within the range reported from clinical
samples of adolescents with depression (25­47%).45,46 Correlates
of the atypical subtype were similar to those found in previous
research. The female preponderance, increased rates of bipolar
spectrum and anxiety disorders in adults, and higher BMI scores
have been found in both clinical and community samples.20,43,47,48
As demonstrated by previous studies,47,49 adolescents with this
subtype more often had any binge eating disorder compared with
those with the moderate type. This association is not surprising
given the conceptual overlap between the two conditions. The
earlier finding that the atypical subtype is associated with
metabolic syndrome ­ a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular
disease and diabetes ­ suggests the importance of the somatic
component in atypical depression.20 Therefore, the presentation
of this subtype in adolescence provides an important target for
developing assessment and treatment strategies that address
possible somatic and metabolic abnormalities as well.
Overall, change in appetite was the most potent indicator that
seemed to differentiate between subtypes. Interestingly, several
previous studies using factor analysis found an appetite/weight
factor, with positive factor loadings for increased appetite and
weight, and negative loadings for decreased appetite and weight,
suggesting that variations in appetite and weight are defining
features of depression that may distinguish between affected
individuals.7,44 Indeed, the atypical subtype observed in both
adolescents and adults was primarily defined by appetite and
weight gain, as has been also shown in prior work.14,20,21,43
Limitations
This study has several limitations that should be considered when
interpreting the results. First, the conditional branching inherent
in the CIDI may have led to an underestimation of atypical
symptoms. Skip rules were used in the interview for questions
assessing changes in appetite or weight, changes in sleep and
psychomotor changes, so that if one symptom was present (for
example, decreased appetite), the question to assess its reverse
(increased appetite) was not administered. Because some
individuals present with different symptoms in different episodes,
or even present with both variants during the same episode, this
study may have underestimated the true prevalence of atypical
depression. Nevertheless, our results are highly comparable to
LCAs of data where skips were not used.20 Second, some variables,
including number of episodes and family history, had substantial
numbers of missing values. Third, only DSM-IV criterion
symptoms were used in this study; other symptoms of depression
that might be present in adolescents, such as irritability, were not
included. Fourth, although the DSM-IV definition of atypical
depression requires the presence of mood reactivity (in addition
to two or more of the symptoms of weight gain or increased
appetite, hypersomnia, leaden paralysis and interpersonal
rejection sensitivity), it was not included in our LCA because no
information on mood reactivity was available in NCS-A and
NCS-R. The atypical subtype therefore does not strictly adhere
to the DSM-IV criteria. However, the hierarchical DSM-IV
definition of atypical depression has been debated in adults and
adolescents.45,47 In addition, mood reactivity did not play an
important part in distinguishing subtypes in one previous LCA
study.20
Implications
These findings provide new insights into subtypes of depression in
adolescents. With respect to nosology, when taken together with
previous research regarding distinct biological correlates,20,24,26,50
and treatment response of the atypical subtype,22,23,51 our findings
support retention of the atypical specifier in the DSM-5. As shown
previously by Leventhal et al29 and others, these results also
demonstrate that specific subgroups of depression can be
distinguished in community samples of adolescents. These
subgroups appear similar to those identified in clinical samples
of young people as well as both clinical and community samples
of adults. Although these symptom profiles in adults and
adolescents display substantial overlap, this does not provide
evidence of continuity of profiles from adolescence to adulthood.
Several studies of depression in both adults and adolescents have
demonstrated that the stability of subtypes and symptoms appears
low,9,11,52 and that a substantial proportion of young adults even
meet criteria for different subtypes simultaneously.53 Because
subtype stability may be essential to its clinical usefulness, future
research is needed to evaluate the continuity and correlates of
subtypes over time. Increased understanding of the subtypes of
depression in adolescence may also enhance our ability to provide
timely and effective treatment, particularly because a substantial
proportion of adolescents with depression do not respond to
evidence-based treatment,54 and episode recurrence is
common.55,56 Longitudinal research might also help to identify
the timing of changes across subtypes that could inform the
optimal timing of intervention.
