This paper describes an evaluation of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics' American Time Use Survey (ATUS) for potential use in modeling human
exposures to environmental pollutants. The ATUS is a large, on-going, cross-sectional survey of where Americans spend time and what activities they
undertake in those locations. The data are reported as a series of sequential activities over a 24-h time period F a ``diary day'' F starting at 0400 hours.
Between 12,000 and 13,000 surveys are obtained each year and the Bureau has plans to continue ATUS for the foreseeable future. The ATUS already
has about 73,000 diary days of data, more than twice as many as that which currently exists in the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)
``Consolidated Human Activity Database'' (CHAD) that the Agency uses for exposure modeling purposes. There are limitations for using ATUS in
modeling human exposures to environmental pollutants. The ATUS does not report the location for a number of activities regarded as ``personal.'' For
2006, personal activities with missing location information totaled 572 min/day, on average, for survey participants: about 40% of their day. Another
limitation is that ATUS does not distinguish between indoor and outdoor activities at home, two of the traditional locational demarcations used in human
exposure modeling. This lack of information affects exposure estimates to both indoor and outdoor air pollutants and potentially affects non-dietary
ingestion estimates for children, which can vary widely depending on whether or not a child is indoors. Finally, a detailed analysis of the work travel
activity in a subsample from ATUS 2006 indicates that the coding scheme is not fully consistent with a CHAD-based exposure modeling approach. For
ATUS respondents in this subsample who reported work as an activity, roughly 48% of their days were missing work travel at one or both ends of the
work shift or reported within work-shift travel inconsistently. An extensive effort would be needed to recode work travel data from ATUS for EPA's
exposure modeling purposes.

Introduction
Since the early 1980s the US Environmental Protection
Agency's (EPA) Office of Air Quality Planning and
Standards (OAQPS) has modeled exposures to environmen-
tal pollutants using a time-series approach (Johnson, 1995).
A major output of these models has been ``the time pattern of
dose rate received'' in the respiratory system, as that process
is what gives rise to adverse health risks associated with
airborne pollutant exposures (McCurdy, 1997). Time series
exposure models enable the researcher to explicitly account
for the correlated, and sequential, nature of human activity,
``activity level,'' and location as a person goes through her or
his daily life. OAQPS' Air Pollution Exposure Model
(APEX) uses a time series approach, described in Ambient
Standards Group (2007) and other reports available on
EPA's Technology Transfer Network (http://www.epa.gov/ttn/).
The multi-route, multi-media time series logic used in APEX
is now also used in OAQPS's Total Risk Integrated Model
(TRIM; Palma et al., 1999) and in the EPA National
Exposure Research Laboratory's Stochastic Human
Exposure and Dose Simulation model (Burke et al., 2001;
Xue et al., 2006).
One distinguishing characteristic of all these models is their
need for human activity time use data that are specific to an
individual and temporally sequential (chronological) for
every activity undertaken and every location visited. The
models use the midnight-to-midnight time period so that
hourly and daily exposures are simulated efficiently. Time use
data having all these characteristics are needed on a
longitudinal basis for the exposure models, so NERL
developed the Consolidated Human Activity Database
(CHAD; available at http://www.epa.gov/chadnet1/)
(McCurdy et al., 2000). CHAD contains 22,716 person-
days of data, most of which are from probability-based,
nationally representative studies. The remainder are from
panel studies that are either probability-based for a single
urban area or are from convenience samples of smaller areas.

Another 12,500 person-days of time-use data are not yet
incorporated into the web-based CHAD program; these data
are available upon request. Almost 37% of the data used by
OAQPS is cross-sectional in nature, 1 day per person, while
2-day diaries constitute 34% of the database. The remaining
30% have 3 or more diary days of data for a single
individual. EPA's exposure models cited above simulate
subjects' time series in silico by linking individual days of
information longitudinally in a manner that replicates intra-
and inter-individual variability and daily correlations from
observed time-use data (Glen et al., 2008). About 34% of the
data used by OAQPS was collected after 2000, roughly 45%
is from the 1990s, and the remainder (21%) was collected in
the 1980s. The older data in CHAD may no longer reflect
well where people are in time and space.
A relatively new source of human activity data is the
American Time Use Survey (ATUS). The US Census
Bureau conducts a number of probability-based, nationally
representative surveys every year for the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS), two of which are the Current Popula-
tion Survey (CPS) and ATUS. The ATUS is described at
http://www.bls.gov/tus/. The ATUS collects data on how
Americans spend time on 1 day a year, which BLS calls ``a
typical day.'' The data are downloadable from its website, as
are the coding manuals, activity lexicon, lists of variables
surveyed, data dictionaries, and so on (BLS, 2007a). The
ATUS is further described below.
The intent of this paper is to investigate the ATUS
database from the perspective of using it in EPA's time series
exposure simulation models cited above. We also provide
descriptive statistical analyses of data from ATUS regarding
``travel,'' an important topic in modeling ``near-roadway,''
and ``in-cabin'' exposures (Flachsbart, 1995; Adar et al.,
2007a, b). To our knowledge, ATUS has not yet been used
by the exposure modeling community, even though it
contains more-current time use information than does
CHAD or any single data source that we know of.
The ATUS
The ATUS is a continuously administered survey of how
non-institutionalized civilian US residents use time. It is a
probability-weighted, national, cross-sectional survey of time
use based on a sampling design that selects one person Z15
years old per household from households that completed
eight previous CPS interviews. It is a ``post hoc'' survey,
asking the respondent what he or she did for the 24-h period
starting at 0400 hours on the previous day. For each activity
undertaken, questions are asked about what the person was
doing, where the activity occurred, and who the person was
with at the time (BLS, 2007b). Twenty-six locations
(TEWHERE) are coded: 14 specific places, 10 transit types,
and two that are not very informative (``unspecified place''
and ``unspecified mode of transportation''). In addition, two
of the ``specific'' TEWHERE codes are not informative from
an exposure perspective: ``other place'' (TEWHERE ¼ 11)
and ``other mode of transportation'' (TEWHERE ¼ 21).
This nonspecific location data illustrates a limitation common
throughout extant activity data, including those in CHAD.
The complete list of locations captured by the TEWHERE
variable in ATUS appears in Table 1.
There are 406 activity codes used in ATUS (BLS, 2006).
Specific activities are classified into 17 major (Tier 1)
Table 1. Locations coded in the American Time Use Study (TEWHERE).

categories, 84 subcategories (Tier 2 codes), and 200 Tier 3
activities; see Table 2, clearly an impressive breakdown.
The ATUS data are available starting in 2003. Respon-
dent sample sizes for ATUS data, released as of July 2009 are
as follows:
As of this writing, 85,645 person-days of activity data are
available for public use. The ATUS data are comma-
delimited; BLS provides SAS, SPSS, and Stata code for
reading the data sets by these software products. BLS also
periodically publishes analyses of ATUS data on its website
(BLS, 2007b, 2008) or in its Monthly Labor Review (Allard
et al., 2007; Krantz-Kent and Stewart, 2007). Additional
ATUS papers have been published recently (Abraham et al.,
2006; Hamermesh, 2008; Tudor-Locke et al., 2008).
Methods
We analyzed selected data from the 2003­2007 ``waves'' of
ATUS data; 2008 data were not available when we under-
took our analyses. We focused some of the analyses solely on
2006, as that was the latest year of data available when we
started our work, and findings for that year apply to the
other years for the variables we investigated based on study
documentation. We evaluated data from 2003 to 2007 when
we tested for trends in travel time by selected trip types. Our
analysis was executed in SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., 2004,
2005), and results reported are from the UNIVARIATE,
MEANS, FREQ, MIXED, and GPLOT procedures.
Weighted analysis in this work combined ATUS data for
2003­2007, using TU06FWGT as the analysis weight for
2003­2005 and TUFINLWGT as the analysis weight for
2006­2007 (http://www.data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/print.pl/tus/
pooling.htm). BLS made changes to activity coding during
the 2003­2007 surveys, and the differences and methods for
combining response data from these years are also described
in the BLS documentation for combining multiple years of
ATUS data (see http://www.bls.gov/tus/lexiconchanges.pdf
and http://www.bls.gov/tus/multiyearcodes.pdf, which are
linked to the pooling documentation). Weighted quintiles
from SAS MEANS used qmethod ¼os and vardef ¼wgt.
Unweighted analyses are based on the 2006 ATUS response
data.
Although both CHAD and ATUS provide data for
individuals with a discrete age and gender, this work
aggregates the data into cohort categories recommended by
EPA for risk assessment purposes (NCEA, 2006). The
categories, for each gender, are as follows: 16­17, 18­20,

21­44, 45­64, and Z65 years. The ATUS survey also
includes 15-year olds, but we do not report on them here in
any detail as EPA groups together 11- to 15-year-old
adolescents into a single category and ATUS has no data for
o15-year olds.
Results
Number of Activities Coded per Day
In their evaluation of the CHAD database, Graham and
McCurdy (2004) analyzed the number of recorded ``events''
among the various studies as a measure of subject
``compliance.'' From an exposure modeling perspective, an
event occurs whenever an activity, location, or clock hour
changes, so activities 460 min are subdivided into more than
one event. The median number of events per day for adults in
CHAD is 38, with a mean of 39 (Graham and McCurdy,
2004). We calculated the exposure-modeling median and
mean number of events from the 2006 ATUS data and found
they matched those from CHAD. In looking across age/
gender groups in the 2006 ATUS data, there are differences
in the mean number of events recorded, but they are small
and not considered further in our analysis.
Missing Location Information
As mentioned, ATUS does not report location information
for two Tier 1 Activity Codes (01 personal care and 50
unable to code) and for two place and mode of transporta-
tion locations (89 and 99, respectively), see Table 1. Activities
included under personal care are sleeping, napping, and lying
awake; using the bathroom and washing (including bathing/
showering); dressing and grooming; and participating in self-
health care, sex, other private activity, or a personal
emergency. The location code used for these activities is
TEWHERE ¼ À1.
We analyzed the amount of TEWHERE ¼ À1 missing
location data in the 2006 ATUS survey to get a sense of the
issue; the missing location logic is common across the survey
years. See Table 3; data for ATUS codes 50, 89, and 99 are
not addressed in that Table as they have very little impact on
the results. Descriptive statistics for the missing location time
in minutes per day are depicted in the table's columns.
Included are the mean, standard deviation (SD), coefficient
of variation (CV), minimum, maximum, and selected
percentiles of the unweighted respondent distribution (25th
percentile, median, and 75th percentile). Only 6 of the 12,734
respondents in the 2006 survey who were 415-years old
have complete location information for the day surveyed
(0.05% of the sample).
The overall unweighted mean of TEWHERE ¼ À1 miss-
ing location time for 2006 ATUS survey respondents is
572 min/day; the median is 560 min/day. Mean missing
location time varies between 542 and 636 min/day (38­44%
of the day) among the age/gender cohorts and is higher for
younger people than for older. Except for the six individuals

purpose data (see ``Traveling, not otherwise coded''FTE-
WHERE code 181999 in the ``Percent of Total Trips''
column). Table 4 illustrates the level of detail available from
ATUS for all the years surveyed. Although the data can be
disaggregated by age and gender, we combined all respon-
dents' information in Table 4, including that for 15-year olds.
The largest proportions of trips taken are for Work (13.4%),
Shopping (24.2%), Eating and Drinking (11.6%), and
Socializing and Leisure (16.3%). There is some, though
not extensive, variability in the median time spent in Tier 2
activities within each Tier 1 category by those who undertake
travel (historically called ``Doers'' in the exposure modeling
field).
We aggregated the Tier 1 activity codes into five general
categories for further analyses. Tables 5 and 6 present
weighted descriptive statistics for these aggregated categories
for females and males, respectively. ``Education'' travel in
these two tables includes the 180601­180699 codes from
Table 4. ``Household'' includes activity codes 180101­
180499, the first four Tier 1 categories listed in Table 4, plus
codes 180801­181002, and 181401­181999. ``Leisure''
includes Tier 1 codes 181201­181399. ``Shop/Eat'' includes
activity codes 180701­180799 and 181101. ``Work'' trips in
Tables 5 and 6 are the same as the Work and Work-related
activities in Table 4 (codes 180501­180599). We did not
analyze Religious/Spiritual trips (codes 181401­181499).
Travel results for both genders generally seem to be
intuitive and similar across the survey years. Educational
travel for both females and males drop off acutely past age 20
years: see ``% Doers.'' The time spent per day (by Doers) in
educational travel does not change much, however, with age
or survey year. We note that there are some small sample
sizes for this category, especially for respondents 444 years
of age. Proportionately more females undertake household
travel for longer daily periods of time than males in all of the
age groupings. Leisure travel decreases with age in both
genders and this is true for all of the years surveyed. Females
undertake proportionately more shopping trips than do
males, but there is not much difference in the time spent per
day in that activity either between genders or by survey year.
To better understand the ATUS travel data, we undertook
detailed analysis of work-related trips reported by the 2006
sample respondents. There were 3,972 diary days with work/
work-related travel in ATUS (codes 1805xx) for that year:
30.7% of the total days. This percentage seems reasonable as
weekend and non-workers are included in the sample. The
breakdown of respondents with and without one or more
paid employment code (TEWHERE ¼ 2) during their 2006
ATUS surveyed day appears in Table 7, which shows that the
unweighted proportion of ``workers'' varies greatly by age
and gender.
We evaluated time spent in work travel in 2003­2007, by
age/gender group using a weighted analysis of ATUS
responses. We regressed work travel time and the natural
log of work travel time on age category, gender, and their
interaction using the SAS MIXED procedure. On the basis
of the residuals analysis from these weighted regression
models, we found that the natural logarithm of time was
preferred over the original-scale time metric (see Methods
section). Figure 1 depicts the weighted empirical distribution
functions for 2006 by age/gender group. For each year in the
2003­2007 time frame, proportionately more males in all age
categories travel for work than females, and their time spent
in travel is slightly longer. We tested the equality of means for
time spent in work travel by gender, regressing the log of
work travel time on year (a class variable) in SAS MIXED
for the 2003­2007 samples, and found that they were not all
equal (Po0.02 for females and Po0.03 for males). We also
tested the differences between pairwise least squares means
and found that the means for 2005 differed from those for
other years for females and similarly for 2006 for males. We
found no linear trend in time.
The wide interval between the median and maximum
travel times depicted in Tables 5 and 6 for all of the survey
years and by travel type indicates that there are substantive
differences among individuals in the time spent in a particular
travel category. Using the mean estimate for all individuals
in an age/gender cohort can significantly under-predict travel
time for some people. It is usually the people at the ``tail of
the distribution'' who are of most interest from the exposure
modeling perspective (Jordan et al., 1983; Johnson, 1995;
Law et al., 1997; McCurdy, 1997).
In evaluating the ATUS work travel data (1805xx code),
we noticed that the mean values for work travel were lower
than those usually reported (US Census, 2005). The average
daily one-way commute for US workers is 24.3 min/day
(presumably 48.6 min/day round-trip), whereas the ATUS
data for total daily work trips (weighted average) ranged
between 42.6 min (2007) and 45.1 min (2006), with the
earlier three years between 43.7 min and 44.7 min.
To better understand how work travel was coded in ATUS,
we evaluated the activity records for 500 individuals from the
2006 survey who reported at least 1 min in the TEWHERE ¼ 2
location. They are called ``workers'' for our purposes. The
results are depicted in Table 8. Twenty-nine of the diaries could
not be definitively analyzed due to major uncertainties about
the TEWHERE code itself, illogical trip modes/times, and
other discrepanciesFaccounting for 5.8% of the sample.
Worker trips were disaggregated by ``shift'' types and by mode
of travel. Most people worked only one shift during the
sampled day (98.4%), although some of the reported shifts
occurred at either or both ends of the 24-hour day beginning
at 0400 hours. Only 2.6% of the workers sampled worked
at home, a surprisingly small percentage. Equally small is
the number of people who did not report using a car or truck
for work travel: only 10% of all work trips evaluated used
something other than a car or small truckFeither as a
passenger or the driverFin the 500 cases.

Problems that were found with the 1805xx coding included
inconsistent treatment of trips to and from work and during
the work period. To and from issues are depicted in Table 8
as one-side and both (sides) problems. A one-side problem
arose when work travel was coded as a non-work trip either
going to work or coming from work. For instance, there were
69 work trips preceding a TEWHERE ¼ 2 location that were
coded as some other type of trip. About half of these were
coded as a ``socializing and leisure'' (1812xx) trip because the
person did not start work immediately upon arriving at a
TEWHERE ¼ 2 location, even if the social activity only
lasted a few minutes. The same was true for work trips coded
as eating-related (1811xx), personal care (1803xx), or even
household care (1802xx or 1803xx). There were some other
obvious miscoded trips on the ``front-end,'' but these were
minor in comparison with the non-work trip codes used on
the ``back-end'' of a work shift. There were 153 of those.
Most of them were coded as shopping (1807xx), eating,
socializing, and professional care. In these cases (42% of the
subsample evaluated), the leaving-work trip was coded using
the next-activity undertaken by the individual. Although that
is not illogical in itself, it systematically underestimates the
amount of time people travel for work in the ATUS sample,
at least from an exposure modeling perspective. Obviously
to/from work trips are not always handled consistently from
an exposure modeling perspective in ATUS, as these were
called work trips in only 52.2% of the 500-respondent case
review. The ``correct'' coding for exposure modeling
identified work-related travel without regard to the activity
undertaken immediately before or after the trip to/from the
TEWHERE ¼ 2 location.
When just those cases are considered that were coded as
going to/coming from work for a TEWHERE ¼ 2 event, the
mean time spent in work travel is 21.2 min/day going to work
and 21.7 coming from it. These values are still less than those
from the US Census Bureau (24.3 min) each way, but are an
improvement over the 19­20 one-way min/trip obtained
using the ATUS-coded data.
Finally, ``within-shift'' travel when a person is at a
TEWHERE ¼ 2 location is also handled inconsistently in
ATUS from an exposure modeling perspective for those
workers undertaking such a trip. These problems were
confined almost entirely to those people using a car/or truck
for work travel. Sometimes the out/back-to-work trips were
both coded as a work trip (17% of those taking such a trip),
other times only one of these trips was coded as a work trip
(64%)Fgenerally the return trip. Sometimes neither was
coded as a work trip (19%). Probably the latter is the
preferred coding, but a case can be made for using a one-way
back code also. The important point is that how within-shift
trips are treated in ATUS is not always consistent with the
exposure modeling view.
Home and Yard Coding
Another problem with ATUS from an in silico exposure
modeling perspective is the failure to distinguish between a
respondent's home and their yard. Both locations are coded
as TEWHERE ¼ 1. Thus, there is no distinction between the
outdoors and indoors when someone is at home, which
potentially has a major impact on estimating exposures to
airborne pollutantsFboth for ambient air pollutants and for
indoor-source air pollutants. There is also potential for
misclassification with respect to estimating non-dietary
ingestion as a pollutant pathway, as hand- and object-to-
mouth frequencies are often very different between the
indoors and outdoors (Xue et al., 2007). Even if we infer
whether or not an ATUS respondent is indoors given
TEWHERE ¼ 1, depending upon the activity being under-
taken and what events preceded and followed it, there is
uncertainty associated with this approach that could easily
have been avoided if the two locations were coded separately
in ATUS.
Discussion
We evaluated the cross-sectional ATUS data collected by the
US Bureau of Labor Statistics for usefulness in time-series
human exposure simulation models. It is the largest, and
most recent, survey of activity ever undertaken in the United

States. Data from 2003 to 2008 have been released and are
available on the website, and the survey is planned to be
repeated every year for the foreseeable future. ATUS has a
wealth of time use information for people Z15-years old that
should be of interest to exposure assessors, but as we have
seen, there is a significant challenge in linking
TEWHERE ¼ À1 activities to a location. On average, there
are about 572 min/day of TEWHERE ¼ À1 missing location
information in ATUS 2006; only a few of the respondents
have complete location data. As being in a polluted location
F termed a ``microenvironment'' in the literature (Johnson,
1995)Fis by definition of paramount concern to under-
standing exposures (Ott, 1982; Zartarian et al., 2005), this is
a serious shortcoming from a modeling perspective. In

addition, some of the activities in ATUS's personal care
(Tier 1 activity code 01) category are themselves of exposure
interestFparticularly bathing/showering (Cowen and Olli-
son, 2006) F and not knowing where they occur adds
uncertainty to an exposure assessment.
In order to put the ATUS missing location problem into
perspective, we analyzed personal care (PC) activities in
CHAD diaries, see Table 9. The analysis is only approximate
due to differences in what is included as personal care in the
two databases, and to important survey differences. For
example, ATUS data are more recent and entirely cross-
sectional, whereas CHAD contains both cross-sectional and
longitudinal data. In addition, in some of the CHAD studies,
survey respondents and study staff were in face-to-face
contact every day and to reduce embarrassment, respondents
were often told that they did not have to code PC activities at
all. Even so, the number of PC minutes in CHAD is 556 min/
day on average, only 3% lower than TEWHERE ¼ À1 min/
day. The medians for both databases, while lower than the
mean estimates, have the same 3% difference, which gives us
some confidence in being able to compare the two databases.
Table 9 provides a breakdown of PC activities in CHAD
diaries. The first row provides descriptive information for
total PC time by individuals 414-years old in CHAD. The
second row provides PC information for all residential
locations, and while the descriptive statistics are similar, note
that no PC activities occurred in a residential location for 146
people (0.8%) in CHAD. For those with PC, some or all PC
activities occurred in someone else's residence for 507
individuals (2.8%). Note that the median for their PC
activities is 420 min/day, about 77% of the median total PC
time of 545 min/day. Non-residential PC time is significantly
less, as expected, but is quite high for the upper tails of the
distribution. This type of finding is not uncommon for
human activity data: a small proportion of the population
has quite different time use patterns than the majority. It is
often the ``unusual'' group that is of interest from the
exposure modeling perspective (Ott, 1982; Jordan et al.,
1983; Johnson, 1995; Law et al., 1997; Xue et al., 2007).
The TEWHERE ¼ À1 problem needs to be addressed,
perhaps through imputation. The common strategy of
replacing missing information on the basis of an observed
response from a ``similar'' case, however, cannot work for
the ATUS data when TEWHERE is coded ­1 for location
for all PC activities, including sleeping and bathing/shower-
ing. That is, there are no donor data within the ATUS survey
responses for using this imputation approach. Bayesian
missing data models may provide a framework for simulating

missing ATUS responses if a suitable prior distribution can
be identified and used. Looking at activities before and after
the PC activities could aid in developing conditional
probabilities for an activity/location pair assignment when
TEWHERE ¼ À1. The issue of failing to distinguish between
indoor and outdoor activities at home may be more difficult
to address than the TEWHERE ¼ À1 problem. Perhaps the
CHAD databaseFor parts of itFcould be used, despite the
age of the data, in assessing distributions of PC and indoor/
outdoor activities. Analyses to replace missing location/
activity data in ATUS would be a large, but likely
worthwhile, effort due to the sheer amount of more recent
time use data available in ATUS.
We also developed insights into the 200 different activities
included in ATUS. These activities are subdivided into three
hierarchical Tiers that are conducive to analyzing population
participation rates by age, gender, and year. We focused
mostly on work-related travel in this paper as a concrete
example of what data are available in ATUS, but data on
daily participation in other activities having exposure
implications are also collected. One example is the time
spent by individuals using tobacco and/or drugs (Code
120302). Another is the time spent undertaking various
household chores, such as cleaning (020101), doing laundry
(020102), repairing the exterior of a structure (020402),
working in the yard (020501), and so forth. Many of the Tier
1 (major) activity codes have the same level of detail available
as the travel activity example illustrates; see Table 2 for the
number of Tier 3 subcodes available for Tier 2 categories.
In our analyses of work-related travel, we found that
problems exist from an exposure modeling perspective in how
activity is coded for a sample of 500 respondents having one
or more TEWHERE ¼ 2 locations (the respondent's work-
place); see Table 8. Only 52.2% of this sample had a clearly
understandable work-related coding for exposure modeling,
with the remaining using inconsistent approaches for before/
after work-shift travel or within-shift travel. While we know
from the ATUS data that the person is traveling, determining
that the travel is work-related for exposure modeling would
require extensive coding review.
Our weighted analyses of travel for 2003­2007 did not find
any statistically significant trends over time in the work travel
activity codes, using unrevised ATUS categories, by age or
gender cohort. We found that for each year in the 2003­2007
time frame, proportionately more males in all age categories
travel for work than females, and their time spent in travel is
slightly longer. We tested the equality of means for time spent
in work travel by gender and found that they were not all equal
(Po0.02 for females and Po0.03 for males). We also found
that the means for the year 2005 differed from those for other
years for females and similarly for the year 2006 for males.
We want to mention one further point of interest. There is
a major international undertaking to bring together historic
time use information for the United States and other

directly comparable with ATUS estimates. bThere are 18,539 person-days of data in CHAD for people 414-years old. Thus, there are 168 person-days (0.9%) with no recorded PC activities on that
diary day.

be facilitated. The US effort is called the American Heritage
Time Use Data (AHTUD), and it includes activity data from
1965 to 1999 (Tudor-Locke et al., 2007; Merz and Stolze,

calibration'' of respondent weights, so that theoretically
correct comparisons can be made. The adjustment proce-
dures are sophisticated and involve reweighting each
respondent's data on the basis of content-specific algorithms
called the ``calibration framework.'' Two of the studies
