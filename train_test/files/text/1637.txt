Haemoglobin concentration and the risk of death in older
adults: differences by race/ethnicity in the NHANES III follow-up
Accumulating evidence indicates that anaemia in older
adults is a potent risk factor for a variety of adverse
outcomes, including cardiovascular events, recurrent falls,
hospitalizations, poor physical function, and mortality
(Izaks et al, 1999; Penninx et al, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006;
Chaves et al, 2004; Zakai et al, 2005; Culleton et al, 2006;
Denny et al, 2006; Patel et al, 2007; Dong et al, 2008; Patel,
2008). The prevalence of anaemia in community-dwelling
older adults is more than 10% and increases with advancing
age, exceeding 20% in those aged 85 years and older (Salive
et al, 1992; Guralnik et al, 2004). Importantly, the majority
of anaemia cases in the community are mild, with less than
3% of the non-institutionalized older population having
haemoglobin concentrations below 110 g/l (Guralnik et al,
2004). However, the haemoglobin threshold at which
clinicians should be concerned for their patient's risk for
adverse events has not been clearly established (Steensma &
Tefferi, 2007).
The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (haemo-
globin concentration <120 g/l in women and <130 g/l in men)
are often used to define anaemia for clinical and epidemio-
logical purposes, but this definition has been criticized because
it was established in 1968 using limited haemoglobin data
(Spivak, 2005; Beutler & Waalen, 2006). To improve upon this,
researchers have recently analyzed large databases to define
anaemia by identifying the lower boundary of normal values
based on the statistical distribution of haemoglobin after
excluding sick individuals (Beutler & Waalen, 2006). Others
have taken an outcomes-based approach to identify abnormal
haemoglobin values (Izaks et al, 1999; Chaves et al, 2004;
Zakai et al, 2005; Culleton et al, 2006; Denny et al, 2006;
Penninx et al, 2006; Patel et al, 2007). Both methods generally

Summary
Mildly low haemoglobin concentration is associated with increased mortality
in older adults. However, this relationship has not been well characterized in
racial/ethnic minorities. Therefore, this study determined the haemoglobin
threshold below which risk of death is significantly increased in older non-
Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans. Data on 4089
participants of the 1988­94 US National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey who were 65 years of age were analyzed with mortality follow-up
through December 31, 2000. Mean haemoglobin in non-Hispanic whites
(n = 2686) and Mexican Americans (n = 663) was 140 g/l, while in non-
Hispanic blacks (n = 740) the mean was 10 g/l lower. A total of 1944 (47Æ5%)
participants died. Among non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans, age-
and sex-adjusted models showed that the haemoglobin thresholds below
which mortality risk was significantly increased were 4 and 2 g/l respectively,
above the World Health Organization (WHO) cut-off points for anaemia. In
contrast, the threshold for non-Hispanic blacks was 7 g/l below the WHO
criteria. Similar threshold effects were observed when analyzing haemoglobin
in categories and adjusting for multiple confounders. In conclusion, the
haemoglobin threshold below which mortality rises significantly is a full g/dl
lower in non-Hispanic blacks than in non-Hispanic whites and Mexican
Americans.

suggest that the WHO criteria provide a slightly conservative
definition of anaemia for the general older population, having
cut-off points that are too low.
There are, however, significant racial differences in the
distribution of haemoglobin in the United States. Numerous
community-based studies have demonstrated that haemoglo-
bin levels are lower in blacks compared to whites, even among
children and healthy young adults (Pan & Habicht, 1991; Reed
& Diehl, 1991; Perry et al, 1992; Bao et al, 1993; Johnson-Spear
& Yip, 1994; Zakai et al, 2005; Denny et al, 2006; Patel et al,
2007). In older adults, the prevalence of WHO-defined
anaemia is 2­3 times higher in blacks (18­39%) than in
whites (7­17%) (Guralnik et al, 2004; Zakai et al, 2005; Denny
et al, 2006; Penninx et al, 2006; Patel et al, 2007; Dong et al,
2008). Racial differences in haemoglobin values range from 4
to 14 g/l and persist after accounting for socioeconomic status,
health behaviours, nutritional status, and multiple morbidities
(Pan & Habicht, 1991; Perry et al, 1992; Bao et al, 1993;
Johnson-Spear & Yip, 1994). As a result, a number of expert
groups have proposed different criteria to define anaemia
separately by race/ethnicity (Beutler & Waalen, 2006; Earl &
Woteki, 1993; International Nutritional Anemia Consultative
Group (INACG), 2002, Robins & Blum, 2007; WHO/The
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)/United Nations
University (UNU), 2001). However, few outcomes-based
studies have carefully evaluated whether race-specific criteria
are justified.
Given that anaemia is commonly encountered in geriatric
practice and is no longer viewed as an `innocent bystander'
(Nissenson et al, 2003), the current study determined the
haemoglobin threshold below which risk of death is signifi-
cantly increased in older non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic
blacks, and Mexican Americans. In addition, the distributions
of common causes or subtypes of anaemia (e.g. anaemia
associated with nutrient deficiency, chronic kidney disease,
inflammation) were examined by race/ethnicity. Mortality
risks associated with the subtypes of anaemia were examined
as well.
Methods
Study design and population
Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey, 1988­94 (NHANES III) were analyzed. The
NHANES III used a complex multistage sampling design to
provide a nationally representative sample of the civilian non-
institutionalized US population, aged 2 months and older (i.e.
no upper age limit) (National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS), 1994). Children, older adults, African Americans,
and Mexican Americans were oversampled to provide reliable
estimates of health conditions in these subpopulations. All
participants provided written informed consent and then
underwent a home interview followed by a physical examina-
tion either in a mobile examination centre or at home.
Examinations included phlebotomy for those aged 1 year and
older. There were two phases of data collection, each providing
a nationally representative sample. Complete blood counts
were collected in both phases of data collection, but the
requisite tests for determining the subtypes of anaemia were
performed in Phase II (1991­94).
Among 5252 NHANES III participants aged 65 years and
older, 4199 had haemoglobin values available for analysis. An
additional 109 persons were excluded who did not identify
their race/ethnicity as either non-Hispanic white, non-His-
panic black, or Mexican American. In one participant, vital
status tracing was not possible. Therefore, the analytic sample
size for the current study was 4089 older adults; for analyses
restricted to Phase II, 1954 older adults were available for
analysis. Vital status was determined by a search of the
National Death Index through December 31, 2000. There were
1944 deaths over the 12 year follow-up period (median follow-
up was 7Æ3 years). Participants missing haemoglobin values
were significantly older, more likely to be female than male,
less likely to be Mexican American than non-Hispanic white,
and more likely to die over the follow-up period compared
with those not missing haemoglobin values.
Laboratory measurements
The laboratory methods used in NHANES III have been
previously reviewed and described in detail (Gunter et al, 1996,
Guralnik et al, 2004). Briefly, haemoglobin concentration was
measured using a Coulter S-Plus Jr electronic counter (Coulter
Electronics, Hialeah, FL, USA) that was calibrated daily.
Colorimetric methods were used to determine serum iron and
total iron-binding capacity (transferrin Alpkem RFA analyzer,
Clackamas, OR, USA). The Quantimmune Ferritin Kit (Bio-
Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) was used to measure
serum ferritin. Fluorescence extraction was applied to measure
free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (Gunter et al, 1989). The Bio-
Rad Laboratories Quantaphase Folate radioassay kit was used
to determine folate and vitamin B12
. Red blood cell (RBC)
folate was calculated using the following formula after a 1:22
dilution of the whole blood: RBC folate = [(whole blood
folate · 22) ) serum folate (1 ) hematocrit/100)]/[hemato-
crit/100]. For participants who underwent a home examina-
tion, only serum folate was able to be determined.
Serum creatinine was determined by a kinetic rate Jaffe
method using an autoanalyzer (Hitachi model 737, Boehringer
Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). As recom-
mended, serum creatinine values were recalibrated to the
Cleveland Clinic Research Laboratory standard by applying the
following formula: [standardized creatinine = )0Æ184 +
(0Æ960 · uncalibrated serum creatinine)] (Selvin et al, 2007).
The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated
using the following abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal
Disease (MDRD) Study formula expressed for standardized
creatinine: eGFR = [175 · (standardized creatinine))1Æ154 ·
(age))0Æ203 · (0Æ742 if the participant is female) · (1Æ212 if

the participant is black)] (Levey et al, 2006). C-reactive protein
(CRP) level was measured using latex-enhanced nephelometry
(Behring Diagnostics, Somerville, NJ, USA).
Definitions of anaemia and subtypes
Anaemia was defined using the WHO criteria of haemoglobin
concentration <120 g/l in women and <130 g/l in men as well as
by race/ethnicity-specific criteria based on survival analyses
(described in the Data analysis section). Participants were
considered iron deficient if at least 2 of the 3 following criteria
were met: transferrin saturation <15%, serum ferritin <12 lg/l,
and erythrocyte protoporphyrin >1Æ24 lmol/l (Looker et al,
1997). Vitamin B12
deficiency was defined as serum B12
< 200 ng/l (Gunter et al, 1996). Folate deficiency was defined
as RBC folate <106Æ2 lg/l among participants examined in the
mobile examination centre, while serum folate <2Æ6 lg/l was
used to identify deficiency in those examined at home (Gunter
et al, 1996).
Anaemic participants who were not deficient in iron, folate,
or B12
were evaluated for other causes of anaemia. An eGFR
<60 ml/min per 1Æ73 m2 was used to identify those with
anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (Astor et al,
2002). Anaemia of chronic inflammation (ACI), characterized
by reduced circulating serum iron levels but adequate iron
storage, was defined as serum iron <10Æ74 lmol/l and no
evidence of iron deficiency. If participants with anaemia were
not classified with nutrient deficiency, chronic kidney disease,
or ACI, then they were considered to have unexplained
anaemia.
Demographic and health status measures
A wide range of demographic and health status variables were
collected during the home interview. Participants were asked
to self-identify their race and ethnicity. Socioeconomic
position was assessed in terms of the highest grade of
education completed and by the poverty income ratio, defined
as household income divided by the US poverty level according
to household size and area of residence. A standard set of
questions were used to classify participants as never, former, or
current smokers. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using
measured height and weight (BMI = weight in kilograms/
height in metres squared). Medical conditions were assessed by
asking participants if a doctor has ever told them that they had
any of the following: cancer (non-skin related), congestive
heart failure, diabetes, heart attack, pulmonary diseases
(asthma, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema), rheumatoid
arthritis, and stroke. In addition, participants were asked if
they had difficulty walking a quarter of a mile or walking up to
10 stairs without resting. If participants reported much
difficulty or were unable to do these activities, then they were
considered to have mobility limitations. Finally, overnight
hospitalization stays within the past year were also assessed
through self-report.
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics (means and proportions) were used to
examine the baseline characteristics of the study sample by race/
ethnicity (Table I). Haemoglobin concentration was analyzed
both as a continuous and categorical variable. Six haemoglobin
categories were specified a priori, three below the WHO cut-off
point (haemoglobin >10Æ0 g/l, 5Æ1­10Æ0 g/l, and 0Æ1­5Æ0 g/l
below the WHO cut-off point) and three above the WHO cut-
off point (haemoglobin 0Æ0­9Æ9 g/l, 10Æ0­19Æ9 g/l, and 20Æ0 g/l
above the WHO cut-off point). For all survival analyses, the
length of follow-up was calculated from the date of examina-
tion, when blood was collected, to the date of death or the end

of follow-up on December 31, 2000. All analyses were stratified
by race/ethnicity because there were significant interactions of
race (non-Hispanic black versus non-Hispanic white) with
WHO-defined anaemia as well as with the categories of
haemoglobin in predicting mortality; however, there were no
statistically significant differences between Mexican Americans
and non-Hispanic whites or Mexican Americans and non-
Hispanic blacks in mortality risk according to WHO-defined
anaemia or categories of haemoglobin concentration.
Kaplan­Meier survival curves were plotted by categories of
haemoglobin concentration for each racial/ethnic group
(Fig 1). Cox proportional hazard models were then used to
assess the association of haemoglobin level with mortality
(Table II). The first model adjusted for age and sex, while the
second adjusted for all potential confounding factors. Plots of
Schoenfeld residuals were examined to confirm the propor-
tional hazards assumption. To examine the non-linear effects of
haemoglobin concentration and to identify the threshold below
which mortality risk was increased, proportional hazard models
were fitted with a penalized spline for haemoglobin concen-
tration (centred on the WHO criteria cut-off points) adjusting
for age and sex using R statistical software (Fig 2) (Team,
2007). Finally, among Phase II participants, the distribution of
common causes or subtypes of anaemia were compared by race/
ethnicity using chi square statistics in those with anaemia
defined by the WHO criteria and by race/ethnicity-specific
criteria identified by mortality risks (Table III). Proportional
hazard models were also used to determine whether each of the
underlying causes or subtypes of anaemia was associated with
an increased risk of death (Table IV). Using indicator variables
to compare non-anaemia to each of the anaemia subtypes,
a basic model was first fitted adjusting for age, sex, and race/
ethnicity and then a fully adjusted model was estimated. Unless
noted otherwise, all analyses were weighted and accounted for
the complex sampling methods and non-response bias to
provide estimates for the US population using stata software,
version 10. P values <0Æ05 were considered statistically
significant.

73 years and slightly more than half were women (Table I).
Non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans had substan-
tially lower levels of education and income compared to non-
Hispanic whites. Haemoglobin concentration was on average

smoking and the mean BMI was higher in non-Hispanic
blacks, although non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans
were more likely to be former smokers. Congestive heart
failure, diabetes, mobility limitations, and overnight hospital-
izations were more common in non-Hispanic blacks and
Mexican Americans than in non-Hispanic whites; however,
this pattern was reversed for cancer and pulmonary diseases.
The association of haemoglobin level with mortality is
shown in Fig 1. Among older non-Hispanic whites, the
survival curves clearly separated, with lower haemoglobin
concentration associated with poorer survival that was sus-
tained over time. In contrast, a clear survival gradient across
haemoglobin levels was not seen in older non-Hispanic blacks,
but rather poor survival was only observed in those with
haemoglobin >10Æ0 g/l below the WHO cut-off point. Impor-
tantly, non-Hispanic blacks with haemoglobin 0Æ1­5Æ0 g/l
below the WHO cut-off point had a survival pattern similar
to those with haemoglobin levels above the WHO cut-off
point. Although the survival curves were less stable in older
Mexican Americans because of smaller sample sizes and lower
event rates, survival was worse in those with lower haemoglo-
bin concentration.
After adjusting for age and sex, there was a stepwise
increased risk of death associated with lower haemoglobin
concentration in non-Hispanic whites relative to those in the
reference category of haemoglobin 10Æ0­19Æ9 g/l above the
WHO cut-off point (Table II). There was even a significant
27% increased mortality risk in those with a haemoglobin
0Æ0­9Æ9 g/l above the WHO cut-off point. For non-Hispanic
blacks, mortality risk was flat until haemoglobin was down to
5Æ1­10Æ0 g/l below the WHO cut-off point, but only became
clearly significant for those >10Æ0 g/l below the WHO cut-off
point compared to the reference group. Mexican Americans
had a stepwise increased risk for mortality associated with
lower haemoglobin level that was similar to the pattern
observed in non-Hispanic whites, although mortality risk was
nearly fivefold higher in Mexican Americans with haemoglobin
>10Æ0 g/l below the WHO cut-off point relative to the
reference group. Further adjustment for socioeconomic fac-
tors, health behaviour, and health status did not substantially
change the patterns of association (Table II). Consistent with
results in Table II, the non-linear association between haemo-
globin and mortality adjusted for age and sex is shown in Fig 2.
The haemoglobin threshold below which risk of death
increased significantly was 4 and 2 g/l above the WHO cut-
off point in non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans,
respectively. In non-Hispanic blacks, however, the threshold
was 7 g/l below the WHO cut-off point.

Table III shows the distribution of the subtypes of anaemia
by race/ethnicity. Among those with WHO defined anaemia,
nutrient deficiency ranged between 33% and 41% across the
three racial/ethnic groups. Iron deficiency anaemia was higher
among Mexican Americans but not statistically different
(P = 0Æ12), whereas folate deficiency was significantly more
common in non-Hispanic blacks (P < 0Æ01). The proportion
of anaemic non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans
with chronic kidney disease (eGFR <60 ml/min per 1Æ73 m2)
alone was twice as high as compared to non-Hispanic blacks,
but these differences were not statistically different
(P = 0Æ10). In contrast, the proportion with ACI alone was
more than doubled in non-Hispanic blacks relative to non-
Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans (P < 0Æ01). Unex-
plained anaemia did not vary by race/ethnicity (P = 0Æ81),
but was less common in Mexican Americans than in non-
Hispanic whites or non-Hispanic blacks. Interestingly, when
ethnicity-specific haemoglobin cut-off points (identified from
survival analyses in Fig 2) were used to define anaemia
instead of the WHO criteria (Table III), the distribution of
anaemia subtypes did not substantially change even though
the number of anaemia cases increased in non-Hispanic
whites (from 138 to 210) and decreased in non-Hispanic
blacks (from 86 to 45).
The association of anaemia subtypes with mortality is shown
in Table IV. Relative to those who were non-anaemic accord-
ing to WHO criteria, anaemia in participants with nutrient
deficiency and ACI was associated with a significantly
increased risk of death adjusting for age, sex, and race/
ethnicity. In contrast, when ethnicity-specific criteria were
applied to define anaemia, each subtype was a significant
predictor of mortality except for unexplained anaemia
(P = 0Æ06) adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Further
adjustment for potential confounding factors generally
reduced the strengths of association.
Discussion
In a nationally representative cohort of community-dwelling
older adults, the current study found that the haemoglobin
threshold below which mortality risk was significantly
increased varied by race/ethnicity. Among non-Hispanic
whites and Mexican Americans, the haemoglobin thresholds
were 4 and 2 g/l respectively, above the WHO cut-off points
for defining anaemia, while in non-Hispanic blacks the
threshold was 7 g/l below the WHO criteria. These differences
are remarkably consistent with known racial/ethnic differences
in the distribution of haemoglobin concentration. In the

Haemoglobin and Mortality Risk in Older Adults

NHANES III, haemoglobin was, on average, 10 g/l lower in
older non-Hispanic blacks than in non-Hispanic whites, which
was nearly the same magnitude of difference in haemoglobin
thresholds for increased risk of death. Importantly, the
distribution of common causes of anaemia generally did not
differ by race/ethnicity and each anaemia subtype was asso-
ciated with higher mortality compared to non-anaemic
persons. Taken together, these findings indicate that racial
differences in the haemoglobin threshold for mortality are not
explained by differences in the distribution of common causes
of anaemia in older adults. Thus, these findings underscore the
need to clinically address mild cases of anaemia in older adults
and provide outcomes-based evidence that a revised definition
of anaemia is needed that takes race into account.
Racial differences in haemoglobin distribution are believed
to result, in part, from strong genetic pressure exerted by
endemic malaria in various regions of Africa. For instance,
certain haemoglobinopathies, such as a-thalassaemia, that
reduce the burden of malaria infection, occur more frequently
in blacks than in whites. Indeed, Beutler and West (2005)
showed that as much as one-third of the racial difference in
haemoglobin concentration might be explained by a-thalas-
saemia. Given that haemoglobin concentration is heritable
(heritability estimates range 0Æ37­0Æ59) (Evans et al, 1999;
Garner et al, 2000; Sala et al, 2008), it is conceivable that other
genetic adaptations to environmental demand inside and
outside of Africa contribute to racial differences in haemoglo-
bin set point.
Few studies have prospectively assessed the effect of
haemoglobin or anaemia on adverse outcomes separately by
race or ethnicity. In a cohort of older adults living in North
Carolina, Denny et al (2006) showed that WHO-defined
anaemia was associated with an increased risk of death in
both black and white participants, but haemoglobin thresholds
for predicting mortality were not evaluated by race. In
contrast, a study of relatively healthy and well-functioning
older adults showed that WHO-defined anaemia significantly
predicted mortality over a 6-year period in whites, but not in
blacks (Patel et al, 2007). Although there was some indication
that mortality risk increased at a lower haemoglobin threshold
in black men than in white men, there were not enough deaths
in the study to determine stable threshold effects by race and
sex (Patel et al, 2007). More recently, a lower haemoglobin
threshold for mortality risk was observed in community-
dwelling older blacks than in whites living in Chicago (Dong
et al, 2008).
A limitation of the current study and others in the literature
is that haemoglobin was assessed on a single occasion. While it
is likely that low haemoglobin in some participants would have
resolved 3­6 months later, this is unlikely to explain the

survival gradients shown in Fig 1. A second limitation is that
there were not enough racial/ethnic minority participants
available to further stratify the analyses by sex, although all
analyses were adjusted for sex and there were no significant sex
by haemoglobin interactions. The major strength of the study
is that the sample is representative of community-dwelling
older adults in the United States. In addition, the NHANES III
cohort was followed-up for mortality over a long time period
and the study participants were well characterized to enable
adjustment for multiple potential confounding factors. Finally,
unlike any previous large, population-based study of anaemia
in older adults with long-term mortality follow-up, the
laboratory testing in NHANES III permitted classification of
subjects into common subtypes of anaemia. Although more
up-to-date laboratory measures, including tests for methylma-
lonic acid and serum transferrin receptor levels, and a
more in-depth clinical haematological work-up would have
improved this classification, the distribution of anaemia
subtypes did not vary substantially by race/ethnicity.
In conclusion, anaemia is a multifactorial condition that is
associated with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults.
While further research is needed to elucidate the pathophys-
iology of unexplained anaemia cases in late life (Longo, 2005),
results from the current study demonstrated that the major
subtypes of anaemia are associated with increased risk of death.
The majority of anaemia cases in older adults are probably
amenable to therapy, but whether correcting mild anaemia
improves function and survival will require randomized
controlled trials. Therefore, it is imperative that, for clinical
and research purposes, a clear case definition of anaemia be
established. In view of the NHANES III mortality results as
well as the extant literature documenting racial differences
in haemoglobin distribution, a revised definition of anaemia
that takes race into account should be considered. To establish
the haemoglobin cut-off points based on risk for adverse
events, there must be consistency across studies and therefore
additional epidemiological research in racially/ethnically
diverse cohorts is required.
