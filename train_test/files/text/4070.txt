Abstract
Objective: The results of segmental venous resection (VR) combined with pancreatoduode-
nectomy (PD) are controversial but may be promising. Few studies have described reconstruction
of the portal/superior mesenteric vein (PV/SMV) with the iliac vein harvested from donation after
cardiac death (DCD).
Methods: From January 2014 to April 2016, PD combined with segmental excision of the PV/SMV
(VR group) was performed in 21 patients with adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas
(ADHP). The authors established a new technique of venous reconstruction using the iliac vein
from DCD and analysed patients' long-term survival.
Results: The tumour dimensions and tumour staging were greater and the operation time was
longer in the VR than PD group; however, no differences in the resection degree, blood loss,
complications, reoperation rate, or mortality rate were found. The median survival was similar
between the VR and PD groups. The long-term patency of the donor iliac vein was 90%. The
degree of resection was a strong predictor of long-term survival.
Conclusion: Segmental PV/SMV resection combined with PD is applicable to selective patients
with venous invasion by ADHP if R0 resection has probably been achieved. An iliac vein obtained by
DCD provides an effective graft for venous reconstruction.

Introduction
According to the NCCN guidelines, solid
pancreatic tumour invasion to the superior
mesenteric vein (SMV) or portal vein (PV) is
considered borderline resectable or unre-
sectable cancer.1 Increasingly more studies
are showing that venous resection (VR)
combined with pancreatoduodenectomy
(PD) is safe and has a long-term survival
comparable with that of standard PD.2­4
VR is classified into four types: type 1
involves partial venous excision with direct
closure, type 2 involves partial venous exci-
sion using a patch, type 3 involves segmental
resection with primary venovenous anasto-
mosis, and type 4 involves segmental resec-
tion with an interposed venous conduit.5
In clinical practice, venous graft interpos-
ition following segmental resection of the
PV/SMV remains only a small part of
vascular reconstruction,6,7 and the operative
procedure, venous status, and long-term
outcomes still require detailed evaluation.
A recent report from the authors' depart-
ment presented a new venous reconstruction
technique using the iliac vein harvested from
donation after cardiac death (DCD) and
addressed the feasibility of this method.8
Further exploration of the long-term sur-
vival, safety and R0 resection is needed,
especially in comparison with PD in patients
with adenocarcinoma of the head of the
pancreas (ADHP). On the basis of this
previous work, the current study was per-
formed to evaluate the safety and long-term
results of excision of the PV/SMV combined
with PD and identify the potential factors
influencing survival.
Materials and methods
Ethics statement
The need for the iliac vein as a homograft was
registered in the China Organ Transplant
Response System and then harvested by
DCD by the assigned coordinator of this
system. This study was approved by the ethics
committee of Chaoyang Hospital Affiliated to
Capital Medical University. After obtaining a
full understanding of the details of the vascu-
lar allografts, all patients provided written
informed consent to undergo the operation.
Patients
From January 2014 to April 2016, patients
who underwent PD for treatment of ADHP
were reviewed in the Hepatobiliary and
Pancreatic Department of Chaoyang
Hospital. The enrolled patients were divided
into two groups: the PD group and the VR
combined with PD group (VR group). In the
PD group, PD was performed without
venous reconstruction. In the VR group,
venous graft interposition following seg-
mental resection of the PV/SMV was per-
formed in combination with PD. The three
exclusion criteria were as follows. First,
arterial invasion is associated with a lower
survival rate and higher perioperative mor-
tality rate; therefore, arterial invasion was
regarded as unrespectable, and such patients
were excluded.9 Second, patients who had
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were
excluded. Finally, patients who underwent
1340 Journal of International Medical Research 44(6)
other venous reconstruction techniques such
as direct suturing, end-to-end anastomosis, or
patch repair were excluded. The demographic
data, perioperative details, pathologic find-
ings, and survival data were collected from
our database. Enhanced computed tomog-
raphy (CT) or three-dimensional vascular
reconstruction was performed to determine
the local status of the PV/SMV and tumour
before the operation. Survival was evaluated
from the date of postoperation to death or the
end of the follow-up period.
Surgical management
En bloc PD was performed in both groups.
Dissection of the retropancreatic lymph
nodes and skeletonization of the hepato-
duodenal ligament were routine procedures.
Child's type digestive tract reconstruction
was performed. The anastomotic pancrea-
tojejunostomy techniques in the two groups
included the placement of running sutures
from the pancreatic parenchyma to jejunal
serosa, the placement of sutures from the
duct of Wirsung to the jejunal mucosa,
and stenting of the main pancreatic duct.
A >1-mm negative resection margin,
<1-mm negative resection margin, and the
macroscopic presence of a residual tumour
were considered R0, R1, and R2 resection,
respectively.
Venous reconstruction
The iliac vein was harvested by DCD and
preserved at À80C in accordance with the
existing standards in the authors' hospital.10
The duration of cryopreservation did not
exceed 6 months. On the day of surgery, the
cryopreserved donor iliac vein was
immerged in saline at 37C. After thawing
for 5 minutes, the iliac vein was rinsed and
placed in lactated Ringer's solution at 4C
for subsequent use.
After segmental excision of the PV/SMV
together with the specimen, frozen
pathologic examination of the ends of the
resected vein was performed to ensure that
the venous extremities were cancer-free.
The patients in the VR group were clas-
sified into two types based on the sites of
PV/SMV invasion. In type I, the preopera-
tive enhanced CT images showed that the
pancreatic tumour had invaded the lumen of
the SMV and that the splenic vein (SV) was
intact. Intraoperatively, after cutting off
the pancreas, we confirmed invasion of the
SMV and clamped this vein. The tumour
combined with the SMV was removed, and
end-to-end anastomosis of the internal or
external iliac vein (harvested by DCD) to the
SMV was performed (Figure 1). In type II,
invasion of the pancreatic malignancy to the
junction of the SMV and SV was suspected
on the preoperative CT angiography images
and then verified by surgical exploration.
Thus, occlusion of the PV, SV, and SMV
was performed simultaneously, and the
tumour was resected together with the
invaded segmental vessels. Finally, the allo-
graft was pruned into three branches, and
the common iliac vein, external iliac vein,
and internal iliac vein were connected to the
recipient PV, SMV, and SV, respectively
(Figure 2). Both the anterior and posterior
walls of the recipient's PV/SMV were ana-
stomosed to appropriately interposition the
iliac vein with running 6-0 polypropylene
sutures. Approximately 100 ml of static
blood was exsanguinated to prevent aero-
embolism and acidosis before the last suture
was placed.
Anticoagulation strategy
Low-molecular-weight heparin (0.3 ml,
2850IU anti-Xa activity) was subcutaneously
injected twice a day during the first week after
surgery for anticoagulation treatment. This
drug was then changed to oral enteric-coated
aspirin tablets (100mg) once a day for up to
6 months postoperatively. Ultrasonography
on day 3 postoperatively and enhanced CT
Zhao et al. 1341
on day 7 postoperatively were applied to
evaluate the patency of the homograft.
Statistical analysis
An independent-samples t-test and a chi-
square test were used to compare the
continuous and categorical variables,
respectively, of the two groups. The log-
rank test based on the Kaplan­Meier curve
was applied to evaluate survival in the two
groups. Multivariate Cox regression ana-
lysis was performed to identify factors
impacting survival. A P value of 0.05 was

considered statistically significant. SPSS ver-
sion 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used
to perform the data analysis.
Results
In total, 106 patients were enrolled in this
retrospective study (21 in the VR group, 85
in the PD group). The overall survival
duration was 20.8 months during the aver-
age follow-up period of 18.2 months. The
clinical, laboratory, and pathologic results
are summarized in Table 1. The tumour
dimensions were significantly greater and
the rate of regional lymph node metastasis
was significantly lower in the VR than PD
group (3.7 vs. 2.8 cm, P < 0.01 and 14% vs.
45%, P ¼ 0.01, respectively). The tumour
stage was significantly more severe in the VR
than PD group (P ¼ 0.01). The duration of
the operation was significantly prolonged
due to VR and venous reconstruction (510
vs. 407 min, P < 0.01); however, no signifi-
cant differences were found between the VR
and PD groups in terms of blood loss (938
vs. 731 ml), complications (29% vs. 16%),
reoperation (14% vs. 7%), or mortality (5%
vs. 2%). Pancreatic fistula (PF) was the most
common and serious complication in the
current study. PF was diagnosed in seven
patients of the PD group and in three
patients of the VR group following the
International Study Group of Pancreatic
Fistula criteria.11 In the PD group, four
patients with a grade C PF developed a
subsequent abdominal infection that
resulted in intra-abdominal bleeding in
three patients. Similarly, two patients in
the VR group underwent an emergent
reoperation because of infection caused by
a grade C PF. Delayed gastric emptying,
mild abdominal infection, and grade A and
B PFs prolonged the hospitalization dur-
ation without inducing serious consequences
in the two groups. The overall R0 resection
rate was 70.9% (73 of 103 patients). The
degree of resection, especially the R0
resection rate, was similar between the two
groups. According to the Kaplan­Meier
curve (Figure 3), there was no significant
difference between the VR and PD groups in
the median survival time (15 vs. 19 months,
respectively). In the Cox regression model,
the degree of resection was the only pre-
dictor of long-term survival (P ¼ 0.004)
(Table 2). There were fewer risks following
R0 (OR 0.151, P ¼ 0.001) and R1 (OR
0.317, P ¼ 0.035) resection than following
R2 resection.
In the VR group, type I and II venous
reconstruction was performed in 14 (66.7%)
and 7 (33.3%) patients, respectively. No
anastomotic bleeding or stenosis occurred in
association with type I or II venous recon-
struction as indicated by enhanced CT in the
early postoperative period. By the end of
follow-up period, the graft patency rate was
90% (19 of 21 patients). Two patients were
hospitalized for transient ascites following
type I venous reconstruction and subse-
quently diagnosed with SMV thrombosis
by CT angiography at 6 and 8 months after
surgery, respectively. Because of the devel-
opment of collateral circulation, these
patients survived without serious complica-
tions. In addition, no patients in the VR
group showed symptoms of infection or
rejection caused by the allograft vein
during the follow-up period.
Discussion
Venous resection combined with PD pro-
vides a radical treatment opportunity for
patients with borderline resectable ADHP;
however, its outcomes remain controver-
sial.12 Although this technique has been
shown to be safe and feasible without
increasing the postoperative mortality and
morbidity rates,13,14 the R0 resection rate
and long-term survival following VR are
undesirable.15 Osamu et al.16 reported that
bilateral and >1.2-cm invasion of the PV/
SMV by a pancreatic tumour was associated
Zhao et al. 1343
with a very poor prognosis. In contrast,
Kure et al.17 showed that even in patients
with PV involvement, >5-year survival
could be achieved if complete tumour extir-
pation (R0 resection) was achieved by PV
resection. Perhaps PV/SMV involvement
is not correlated with tumour invasion and
a poor prognosis but can be regarded as
functional adjacency.18 In the present study,
tumour invasion of the PV/SMV was histo-
pathologically confirmed in 16 of 21 (76%)
patients in the VR group. There were some
differences in venous involvement between
the imaging and histological examination
results. Consequently, Reddy and Hoffman19
questioned whether venous involvement
should be included in the category ``border-
line resectable disease.'' Similar to a previ-
ous study,20 the median survival time in
patients of the VR group in the present
study was not significantly lower than that
in patients of the PD group. Several studies
have found that the long-term survival was
similar between patients who underwent
PV/SMV resection combined with PD and
patients who underwent PD alone.4,5,21­23
R0 resection has been widely accepted as a
strong predictive factor for long-term sur-
vival.1 The R0 resection rate was compar-
able between the VR and PD groups in the
present study (P ¼ 0.726), which perhaps
resulted in the comparable long-term survival.
In a recent report, the International Study
Group of Pancreatic Surgery strongly recom-
mended the limitation of VR and venous
reconstruction to high-volume centers.5
Generally, venous grafting is considered a
necessary method if the length of the
resected segment is >5 cm.24 In the current
study, if the PV/SMV was involved by a
malignancy of >3 cm, venous conduits were
interposed to achieve a negative margin and
tension-free anastomosis. Two sources of
interpositional venous grafts can be used for

revascularization: an autologous vein graft,
such as that taken from the great saphenous
vein; or a superficial femoral vein, external
iliac vein, or internal jugular vein and syn-
thetic graft.25­27 The iliac vein has been
successfully applied as an allograft in living-
donor liver transplantation to resolve
congestion of the anterior sector of right-
lobe grafts.28 Inspired by this surgical man-
agement, we used a portion of the iliac vein
harvested by DCD as an autologous conduit
to restore the PV/SMV continuity.
Compared with a synthetic graft, the exter-
nal iliac vein more closely matches the PV in
terms of its diameter and thickness. Other
advantages of external iliac vein grafts
include better histocompatibility, a lower
incidence of thrombosis, and no need for
long-term anticoagulation. However, exter-
nal iliac vein grafts also have some disad-
vantages. First, the unavailability of donor
iliac vein grafts restricts the application of
this technique, especially for centres without
DCD. Additionally, in type II reconstruc-
tion, the branch of the external and
internal iliac vein may not match the

branch angle of the PV and SV. In contrast,
a suitable synthetic graft can be used for
venous reconstruction in most cases because
of the broad choices available. Second, the
long-term patency of iliac vein grafting
remains unclear because of the shortage of
long-term observation data and few reported
cases. Third, the use of an allograft inevitably
leads to additional infectious and epidemical
risks compared with the use of a synthetic
graft. Overall, however, use of the donor iliac
veins in the present study achieved satisfac-
tory long-term patency and did not lead
to stenosis following antithrombotic treat-
ment. Because of the lack of antigenicity in
cryopreserved grafts, blood matching and
immunosuppression are not needed. The
technique performed in the present study
decreased the operation time and avoided
edema and deep venous thrombosis because
an autologous vein graft was not used. In
addition, the cryopreserved iliac vein was long-
lasting; therefore, it offered a ready-to-use
conduit for venous grafting. One limitation
of the present study is that the results of using
the iliac vein as a graft were not compared with
the results of using an autologous or synthetic
graft. Additionally, the difference in throm-
bosis between the two types of venous recon-
struction could not be estimated because of the
small number of patients.
The iliac vein can serve as a patch when a
portion of the PV/SMV has been resected. An
experienced specialist operator and meticu-
lous perivascular anatomy are indispensable
factors in ensuring high safety and smooth
performance of this surgical approach. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
evaluate the long-term results of reconstruc-
tion of the PV/SMV using the iliac vein
obtained by DCD in patients undergoing
PD for treatment of ADHP.
Conclusion
Segmental PV/SMV resection combined
with PD is comparable with PD in terms
of R0 resection and long-term survival.
Therefore, this technique is applicable to
patients with ADHP if R0 resection has
probably been achieved. The iliac vein
obtained by DCD is appropriate as a con-
duit for PV/SMV reconstruction.
