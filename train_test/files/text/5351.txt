sexual and emotional infidelity

Abstract: Two studies (total N = 689) tested the assumption of DeSteno, Bartlett,
Braverman, and Salovey (2002) that sex differences in jealousy predicted by the
evolutionary view are an artifact of measurement because they are restricted to a forced-
choice response format and do not emerge when using continuous jealousy ratings. In
Study 1, men and women rated how much a mate's emotional and sexual infidelity
contributed to their jealousy feeling. In Study 2, men and women rated the intensity of their
jealousy feeling elicited by a mate's emotional and sexual infidelity. In one condition they
were asked to make their ratings spontaneously whereas in the other condition they were
instructed to make their ratings only after careful consideration. The results of both studies
lend no support for the artifact-of-measurement assumption. The implications of the present
finding for the assumption of DeSteno et al. (2002) are discussed.

Introduction
>From an evolutionary view, the psychological mechanism underlying jealousy has
evolved because it recurrently solved an essential problem of individual reproduction in our
evolutionary history: infidelity in reproductive relationships (Daly, Wilson, and Weghorst,
1982; Symons, 1979). A distinctive feature of the evolutionary view is the assumption of a
sex-specific evolved jealousy mechanism (EJM) because different infidelity types have
recurrently threatened male and female reproductive success. Specifically, a woman's
sexual infidelity deprives her mate of a reproductive opportunity and may burden him with
years of investment in a genetically unrelated child. In contrast, a man's sexual infidelity
does not burden his mate with unrelated children, but he may divert resources from his
mate's progeny if he develops a deep emotional attachment to another woman. As a
consequence, the evolutionary view of jealousy predicts between-sex differences such that
men should be more concerned than women about a mate's sexual infidelity, whereas,
Decision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings
conversely, women should be more concerned than men about a mate's emotional
infidelity.
The prediction of between-sex differences in jealousy generated an impressive body
of research during the past 15 years that has been mainly devoted to testing the hypothesis
that men respond with stronger negative emotions than women to a mate's sexual infidelity
whereas women respond with stronger negative emotions than men to a mate's emotional
infidelity. This hypothesis was primarily tested by men's and women's self-reports about
their jealousy response elicited by a mate's sexual and emotional infidelity. Two response
formats have been used to assess these self-reports. In the most widely used response
format men and women are forced to decide whether a mate's sexual or emotional
infidelity generates more intense jealousy feelings (e.g., Buss, Larsen, Westen, and
Semmelroth, 1992; Buss et al., 1999; Buunk, Angleitner, Oubaid, and Buss, 1996; Pietrzak,
Laird, Stevens, and Thompson, 2002; Sagarin, Becker, Guadagno, Nicastle, and Millevoi,
2003; Wiederman and Kendall, 1999). Across different cultures, women consistently chose
emotional infidelity significantly more frequently than men in this forced-choice response
format (for reviews see Penke and Asendorpf, in press; Harris, 2003).
In contrast to the robust sex differences found with the forced-choice response
format, continuous ratings of the intensity of negative emotional responses elicited by
emotional and sexual infidelity have yielded less consistent results (Harris, 2003; Sagarin,
2005). To illustrate, Pietrzak et al. (2002), Sagarin et al. (2003), Bohner and Wänke (2004),
and Edlund, Heider, Scherer, Farc, and Sagarin (2006) reported the interaction between sex
and infidelity type predicted by the evolutionary view of jealousy with respect to a mate's
hypothetical infidelity. In contrast, DeSteno, Bartlett, Braverman, and Salovey (2002;
Study 1) using multiple continuous response formats consistently found that both men and
women reported more intense negative emotions in response to a mate's hypothetical
sexual infidelity. Similarly, Sabini and Green (2004, 2006) reported that both men and
women rated the emotional impact of sexual infidelity greater than the import of emotional
infidelity for being upset, angry and hurt. However, a peculiarity of the Sabini and Green
(2004) study is that their participants had to first rate how blameworthy the partner was for
his (her) sexual or emotional infidelity, respectively. As the authors convincingly argue, a
partner is to blame for an action for which he or she is responsible (like having sexual
intercourse with another person), but not for an emotion that comes upon us unbidden (like
falling in love with another person; see also Weiner, 1995). Thus, ratings of
blameworthiness might have set an anchor for the immediately following ratings of upset,
angry and hurt. Interestingly, however, explicit ratings of jealousy (Sabini and Green, 2004;
Study 3) marginally produced the interaction between sex and infidelity type predicted by
the evolutionary view. Moreover, Edlund et al. (2006) point out that these failures to
support the evolutionary view of jealousy might be attributable to a ceiling effect because
these studies were using only a seven-point rating scale labeled 1 (not at all) and 7 (very),
thus artificially narrowing the participants' response options.
This lack of correspondence between the findings obtained with the forced-choice
response format and the continuous ratings of emotional intensity led DeSteno et al. (2002)
to question the validity of the empirical support for the evolutionary view of sex differences
in jealousy. These authors argue that this support predominantly derives from a single

Decision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings
methodology, the forced-choice response format. As DeSteno et al. (2002) note, the
limitation to a single methodology always carries the risk of dealing with an artifact of
measurement. This possible limitation, "takes on greater weight when one considers that
the use of a forced-choice response format ... is known to induce different and more
effortful decision strategies in the production of preference judgments" (DeSteno et al.,
2002, p. 1105). As a consequence, "the previous findings used to support the evolutionary
view might not represent differential jealousy resulting from sex-specific evolved modules,
but a methodological artifact resulting from a specific and effortful decision strategy
invoked by the format of the question" (DeSteno et al., 2002, p. 1105).
DeSteno et al. (2002) proposed three assumptions that in combination try to
partially reconcile the diverging results obtained with the two response formats. (1) Men
and women actually share the same default distress response that is greater towards sexual
than emotional infidelity. (2) Continuous ratings invariably elicit rather simple decision
strategies which revert to this default distress response towards sexual infidelity. (3) The
forced-choice response format invariably generates deliberate and effortful considerations
of the possible trade-offs of the two events which asymmetrically affect men's and
women's decisions: The output of these trade-off considerations does not affect men's final
decision as most men continue insisting on their default distress response towards sexual
infidelity. In complete contrast, the same trade-off considerations have a profound impact
on women's choices as the vast majority of women uses the output of these considerations
to override their default distress response. As a consequence, most women now claim that
emotional infidelity generates more intense jealousy feelings. This presumed asymmetry in
the influence of the deliberate and effortful trade-off considerations on men's and women's
responses is finally made responsible for a method-specific sex difference in jealousy
obtained with the forced-choice response format. Note, however, that DeSteno et al.'s
assumption predict within-sex differences for both simple decision strategies (i.e., both men
and women share the same default distress response that is greater towards sexual than
emotional infidelity) as well as deliberate and effortful decision strategies (i.e., men report
greater distress about sexual than emotional infidelity, whereas women report more distress
about emotional than sexual infidelity). In contrast, the evolutionary view of jealousy
predicts between-sex differences in response to sexual and emotional infidelity.
DeSteno et al. (2002) partially tested their assumptions in two studies. In Study 1,
they demonstrated the divergence between forced-choice and continuous scale response
formats: Whereas the forced-choice response format yielded the sex-differences in jealousy
predicted by the evolutionary view, no sex differences were found on various continuous
jealousy measures. Moreover, both men and women reported greater negative emotions in
response to sexual infidelity on the continuous ratings. In Study 2, the participants made
their judgments in the forced-choice response format under two different conditions. In the
deliberate and effortful decision condition, the participants were urged to consider carefully
their response before choosing between sexual and emotional infidelity. In the automatic
(simple) condition, the deliberate and effortful decision processes were supposedly
suppressed by a cognitive load in terms of a digit-string memory task imposed on the
participants while choosing between the two response alternatives, thus forcing the
participants to make their choice using simple decision processes. The deliberate and
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 5(4). 2007. -817-
Decision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings
effortful condition yielded the well-known sex difference inasmuch as 96% of the men but
only 36% of the women selected sexual jealousy. In contrast, in the automatic condition,
the majority of not only the men but also of the women chose sexual infidelity (92% and
65%, respectively). Based on this finding, DeSteno et al. (2002) assume that both men and
women using automatic decision strategies rely on the same initial response tendency
towards sexual infidelity. In contrast, deliberate and effortful decision strategies
asymmetrically affect men's and women's responses: Men, in accordance with their initial
response tendency, still consider sexual infidelity as eliciting stronger jealousy. Women, in
contrast, abandon their initial response tendency and now claim that emotional infidelity
generates more intense jealousy. Note, however, that contrary to DeSteno et al.'s (2002)
claim that "the sex difference on the forced-choice measure disappeared under conditions
of cognitive constraint," (p. 1103) which has been repeated by DeSteno, Bartlett, and
Salovey (2006; see also Berman and Frazier, 2005; Harris, 2003, for the same claim), a
reanalysis of their data shows that the sex difference in the cognitive load condition was
merely attenuated but did not completely disappear as still significantly more women than
men chose emotional infidelity (35% vs. 8%), 2 = 6.20; df = 1; N = 57, p = .013 (Sagarin,
2005). Moreover, the cognitive load study has been criticized both on theoretical (Barrett,
Frederick, Haselton, and Kurzban, 2006) and methodological grounds (Schützwohl, in
press a; see also Penke and Asendorpf, in press). The purpose of the following two studies
was to further examine DeSteno et al.'s predictions of within-sex differences in jealousy
and to contrast them with the predictions of between sex-differences derived from the
evolutionary view with respect to continuous ratings of jealousy.
Study 1
In the standard forced-choice response format (e.g., Buss et al., 1992), the
participants are requested to decide whether a mate's sexual or emotional infidelity
generates comparatively more intense jealousy feelings. In the continuous rating format,
the participants are typically asked to rate the intensity of the emotional reactions elicited
by a mate's sexual and emotional infidelity, respectively (e.g., DeSteno et al., 2002;
Pietrzak et al., 2002; Sagarin et al., 2003).
In the present study, in contrast, the participants indicated on continuous ratings
scales the extent to which a mate's sexual and emotional infidelity contributes to their
jealousy feeling. This task appears to more closely capture the comparative nature of the
original forced-choice response format than the typical intensity ratings described above.
However, at the same time the present task shares an important feature with the typical
intensity ratings because the participants are not forced to differentiate between the two
infidelity types. This feature allows the participants the use of simple decision strategies.
Accordingly, if continuous rating scales invariably elicit simple decision strategies as
suggested by DeSteno et al. (2002), both men and women should indicate that sexual
infidelity contributes more to the jealousy feeling than emotional infidelity because these
simple decision strategies revert to the same within-sex default distress response towards
sexual infidelity. If, however, the sex differences predicted by the evolutionary view of
jealousy are robust and not method specific, between-sex differences should emerge such

Decision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings
that emotional infidelity contributes more to women's than men's jealousy, whereas,
conversely, sexual infidelity contributes more to men's than women's jealousy. In sum,
whereas the assumptions of DeSteno et al. predict only a main effect for infidelity type,
support for the evolutionary view would require an interaction between sex and infidelity
type.
Method
Participants
The participants were 101 female and 98 male students of various disciplines at the
Universities of Bielefeld and Osnabrück. Their age ranged from 19 to 41 years (M = 24.5
years; SD = 4.0). They were not paid for their voluntary participation.
Materials
In this paper and pencil study, the participants were first instructed to think of a
committed romantic relationship that they had had in the past, that they were currently
having, or that they would like to have. They were then asked to imagine that they
discover that their partner formed both a deep emotional as well as a passionate sexual
relationship with another person. Next they were requested to rate the extent to which the
emotional and sexual aspect of their partner's infidelity contributed to their jealousy
reaction on separate rating scales. The seven verbal labels of the two ratings scales ranged
from emotional (sexual) infidelity contributed (from left to right) "not at all"; "barely";
"somewhat"; "pretty much"; "quite a lot"; "very much"; to "exclusively" to their jealousy.
Procedure
The participants were tested individually at various locations in the University
buildings where they were approached by the female experimenter. To enhance the
anonymity of the study, the participants were requested to fold the questionnaire
immediately after its completion and to drop it into an opaque box.
Results
The rated contribution of emotional and sexual infidelity to the jealousy reaction
was subjected to a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with sex as the between-
subjects factor and rating of infidelity type (sexual vs. emotional) as the within-subjects
factor. For this purpose, the respective ratings were assigned values from 1 (contributed not
at all) to 7 (contributed exclusively). The ANOVA yielded a marginally significant main
effect of infidelity type, F(1, 197) = 2.76, p = .098, partial 2 = .014. The main effect for
sex was not significant, F(1, 197) = 2.48, p > .10, partial 2 = .012. Contrary to the
assumptions of DeSteno et al. (2002), emotional infidelity was rated to contribute
somewhat more to the jealousy reaction than sexual infidelity (5.41 vs. 5.21). More
importantly, however, the interaction predicted by the evolutionary view turned out to be
significant, F(1, 197) = 5.52, p = .02, partial 2 = .027. Within-sex comparisons revealed
that women rated the contribution of emotional infidelity significantly higher than that of

Decision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings
sexual infidelity (5.65 vs. 5.18), t(100) = 3.18, p = .002, d = .41. In contrast, men's ratings
for the contribution of sexual and emotional infidelity did not significantly differ (5.23 vs.
5.15), t(97) < 1, d = .06. Between-sex comparisons revealed that women reported that
emotional infidelity contributed more to their jealousy reaction than men (5.65 vs. 5.15),
t(197) = 2.93, p = .004, d = .42. In contrast, men's and women's ratings for the contribution
of sexual infidelity did not significantly differ (5.23 vs. 5.18), t(197) < 1, d = .04.

and sexual infidelity (e = s); who rated emotional infidelity higher than sexual infidelity (e

e = s 41%
Women e > s 40%
s > e 19%
e = s 40%
Men e > s 24%
s > e 36%
In a second analysis step, the individual ratings were pigeonholed in one of three
categories: emotional and sexual infidelity contribute equally to the jealousy reaction;
emotional infidelity contributes more than sexual infidelity; and sexual infidelity
contributes more than emotional infidelity. The percentage of men and women assigned to
the three categories are shown in Table 1. As can be seen from Table 1, an almost equal
percentage of women and men did not differentiate between the contributions of the two
infidelity types (41% vs. 40%). However, more women than men (40% vs. 24%) indicated
that emotional infidelity contributed more to their jealousy reaction, whereas conversely
more men than women (36% vs. 19%) reported that sexual infidelity contributed more, 2 =
8.81, df = 2, n = 199, p = .01.
Discussion
A considerable proportion of men and women did not differentiate between the
contribution of sexual and emotional infidelity to their jealousy feeling. This lack of
differentiation in both men and women presumably indicates that the continuous rating

Decision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings
scales indeed activated simple decision strategies regardless of the participants' sex.
Despite this evidence that the present task encouraged the use of simple decision strategies,
DeSteno et al.'s prediction that this strategy should result in both men and women reporting
more jealousy in response to sexual than emotional infidelity could not be confirmed.
Furthermore, both within-sex comparisons yielded results at variance with their
predictions: Women rated emotional infidelity as contributing significantly more to their
jealousy feeling than sexual infidelity and men's ratings did not differentiate between the
two infidelity types. In contrast the evolutionary view was partially supported inasmuch
that women rated the contribution of emotional infidelity higher than men but no between-
sex differences were found for the contribution of sexual infidelity. Moreover, the
categorical analysis of the ratings revealed results in agreement with the evolutionary view
since more men than women provided higher ratings for the contribution of sexual
infidelity, whereas conversely more women than men provided higher ratings for the
contribution of emotional infidelity.
An obvious limitation of the present study is that the contribution measures are non-
mutually exclusive (Harris, 2002; Berman and Frazier, 2005) which affects those
participants who rated that at least one infidelity type contributed exclusively to their
jealousy reaction while the other infidelity type contributed at least barely to their jealousy
reaction. A reanalysis of the data after excluding those participants yielded virtually
identical results. One might further object that in the present study some participants might
have used simple decision strategies (i.e., those who did not differentiate between the two
infidelity types as well as perhaps those rating sexual infidelity as contributing more to
their jealousy feelings), whereas others might have used more deliberate and effortful
decision strategies (i.e., those rating emotional infidelity as contributing more to their
jealousy feelings). This objection cannot be entirely refuted. Note, however, that this
objection implies that the use of continuous rating scales does not invariably induce simple
decision strategies as tacitly presumed by DeSteno et al. (2002). Moreover, in order to
consider this objection viable one would have to additionally explain why especially
women and to a lesser degree men used deliberate and effortful and effortful decision
strategies when answering continuous rating scales. However, this objection nurtures on
post hoc speculations because the decision strategies in Study 1 were not experimentally
controlled. The purpose of Study 2 was to remedy this shortcoming.
Study 2
Study 2 compared continuous ratings of jealousy elicited by sexual and emotional
infidelity based on either simple or deliberate and effortful decision strategies. The
participants instructed to employ simple decision strategies were requested to make their
ratings as spontaneously as possible and without extensive considerations. In contrast, the
participants instructed to use deliberate and effortful decision strategies were asked to make
their ratings only after careful considerations and to take their time. According to DeSteno
et al. (2002), "a clear dissociation will be found ... between judgments produced under
different levels of cognitive elaboration" (p. 1105). As a consequence, based on DeSteno et
al.'s assumption of a shared default distress response, both men and women in the
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 5(4). 2007. -821-
Decision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings
spontaneous condition should report higher jealousy ratings in response to sexual than
emotional infidelity. Conversely, in the deliberate and effortful condition women, but not
men, should provide higher jealousy ratings in response to emotional than sexual infidelity
due to the asymmetrical impact of the deliberate and effortful decision process on women's
but not men's ratings. If, however, the sex differences are robust and not limited to the
forced-choice response format, the between-sex differences predicted by the evolutionary
view should emerge regardless of the decision strategy. In sum, whereas support for the
evolutionary view requires a two-way interaction between the participants' sex and the
intensity ratings for sexual and emotional infidelity, the assumptions of DeSteno et al.
(2002) should be reflected in a three-way interaction between sex, type of decision strategy
and the two intensity ratings.
Method
Participants
The participants were 268 female and 222 male undergraduate students of
introductory psychology courses at the Universities of Bielefeld and Osnabrück. Their age
ranged from 19 to 49 years (M = 24.0; SD = 5.2). They were not paid for their voluntary
participation.
Material
The participants were first instructed to think of a committed romantic relationship
that they had had in the past, that they were currently having, or that they would like to
have. They were then informed that they discover that their partner had formed a deep
emotional as well as a passionate sexual relationship with another person. Next, they were
asked to indicate the intensity of their jealousy elicited by the imagination of the emotional
and the sexual aspect of their partner's infidelity. In the spontaneous condition, the
participants were instructed to make their decisions as spontaneously as possible, that is
without extensive considerations. In the deliberate and effortful condition, the participants
were instructed to make their decisions only after careful considerations and at their own
pace. In each condition, the sentence containing the respective decision strategy was
presented in bold font to highlight its importance.
Subsequently, to counter potential ceiling effects, two 11-point ratings scales were
provided for the ratings of the intensity of their jealousy feelings elicited by the two aspects
of their partner's infidelity. Additionally, the endpoints of the rating scales were anchored
at 0 (not at all jealous) and 10 (extremely jealous) in order to provide a full range of
response options. The sequence of the two ratings was counterbalanced across sex and
condition. Finally, the participants were asked to indicate whether they had already had a
committed romantic relationship.
Procedure

Decision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings
The participants were tested in groups varying in size. The participants within each
group were assigned to the same condition. The experimenter explicitly stressed the
importance of the respective condition before the participants started to answer the
questionnaire. To enhance the anonymity of the study, the participants were requested to
proceed independently and to fold the questionnaire immediately after its completion.
Results
The vast majority of the participants (93%) reported relationship experience. One
male participant failed to answer the pertinent question. Because there were only 17 men
and 16 women without relationship experience, the following analyses are based on the
data of the 204 men and 252 women with relationship experience. These analyses were
rerun including the participants without relationship experience with essentially unchanged
results.
A three-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) of the jealousy ratings with
participants' sex and decision strategy (simple vs. deliberate and effortful) as the between-
subjects factors and rating of infidelity type (sexual vs. emotional) as the within-subjects
factor yielded a significant main effect of the sex factor, F(1, 452) = 21.35, p < .001, partial
2 = .045. This main effect is attributable to women providing overall significantly higher
ratings than men (8.81 vs. 8.10). Additionally, the interaction between the infidelity ratings
and the decision strategy turned out to be significant, F(1, 452) = 8.48, p = .004, partial 2 =
.018. The jealousy caused by sexual infidelity was rated as significantly more intense in the
simple than in the deliberate and effortful decision strategy condition (8.77 vs. 8.29), t(454)
= 2.67, p = .008, d = .25. In contrast, the intensity of jealousy elicited by emotional
infidelity did not differ between the two decision strategy conditions (8.45 vs. 8.42), t(454)
< 1.
More importantly, however, the interaction between the two infidelity ratings and
participant sex was highly significant, F(1, 452) = 26.67, p < .001, partial 2 = .056. As
illustrated in Figure 1, within-sex comparisons showed that women reported significantly
more intense jealousy in response to a mate's emotional than sexual infidelity (8.99 vs.
8.63), t(251) = 2.88, p = .004, d = .22. Conversely, men reported significantly more intense
jealousy elicited by sexual than emotional infidelity (8.45 vs. 7.75), t(203) = 3.85, p < .001,
d = .31. Between-sex comparisons revealed that in accordance with the evolutionary view
of jealousy, women reported significantly more intense jealousy than men in response to
emotional infidelity (8.99 vs. 7.75), t(454) = 6.64, p < .001, d = .61. Again no sex
differences emerged with respect to jealousy elicited by sexual infidelity (8.63 vs. 8.45),
t(454) = 1.04, d = .09. The three-way interaction that one would have expected on the basis
of DeSteno et al.'s (2002) considerations was virtually non-existent, F(1, 452) = 0.41,
partial 2 = .001. The remaining main and interaction effects also failed to be significant, Fs
< 2.2.

Discussion
Study 2 tested DeSteno et al.'s (2002) assumption that simple decision strategies
reveal men's and women's shared default stress response towards sexual infidelity as
causing more jealousy, whereas deliberate and effortful decision strategies lead women but
not men to override this default stress response. Contrary to these assumptions, women
reported more intense jealousy in response to emotional infidelity, irrespective of the
decision strategy. As in Study 1, the between-sex differences predicted by the evolutionary
view of jealousy were found for emotional but not for sexual infidelity. One might object
that despite the efforts to experimentally control the decision strategies, (some or all of) the
participants did not comply with the instructions. Granted this objection, there are two
possible alternative scenarios. However, each scenario is problematic for one of DeSteno et
al.'s (2002) central assumptions. According to the first scenario, the use of ratings scales
indeed induced simple decision strategies in the participants as proposed by DeSteno et al.,
irrespective of their instructions. If this were the case, then no sex differences should have

Decision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings
been found because simple decision strategies supposedly revert to the default distress
response shared by men and women towards sexual infidelity. According to the second
scenario, the participants employed deliberate and effortful decision strategies. This
scenario would explain the sex differences but is equally problematic for DeSteno et al.
(2002) position because it contradicts their assumption that the use of rating scales
invariably induces simple decision strategies.
As illustrated in Figure 1, the present findings also highlight that jealousy in
romantic relationships elicited by a mate's hypothetical sexual or emotional infidelity
typically is an extremely intense emotion. In fact, 43% of the men and 28% of the women
gave the maximal jealousy rating for hypothetical sexual infidelity. With respect to
hypothetical emotional infidelity, 50% of the women and 45% of the men reported extreme
jealousy. These extreme ratings obviously back up Edlund et al.'s (2006) assumption that
some failures to find sex differences in continuous jealousy ratings for sexual and
emotional infidelity might be attributable to too narrowly defined ratings scales that fail to
capture the frequently extreme nature of jealousy feelings in romantic relationships.
General Discussion
In sum, the results of the present experiments revealed no evidence supporting
DeSteno et al.'s (2002) claim that the sex differences in jealousy predicted by the
evolutionary view are an artifact of measurement because they are restricted to a forced-
choice between emotional and sexual infidelity. By the same token, the present results also
failed to support DeSteno et al.'s (2002) assumption that men and women share the same
initial tendency towards sexual infidelity as that infidelity type generating more jealousy.
Moreover, both their assumptions and the pertinent empirical support they provided face
additional challenges. First, whereas DeSteno et al. (2002; Study 1) found that women
reported greater jealousy in response to sexual infidelity on the continuous measures,
several studies, in addition to the present one, reported exactly the opposite findings with
these measures (e.g., Bohner and Wänke, 2004; Pietrzak et al., 2002; Sagarin et al., 2003).
Moreover, although Harris (2002) did not explicitly request ratings of the intensity of
jealousy feelings, she found that both men and women indicated on five-point rating scales
that they focused more on the emotional infidelity aspect of one's mates' actual infidelity
(but see Edlund et al., 2006, who refuted Harris use of the word focus, and Schützwohl,
2007, for an empirical demonstration of the irrelevance of the focus of jealousy on the
sexual and emotional aspect of infidelity for the evolutionary view).
Second, Schützwohl (2004) provided evidence questioning the adequacy of their
assumption that the forced-choice response format invariably induces deliberate and
effortful decision strategies. In this study briefly mentioned earlier, unbeknown to the
participants, decision times were assessed in the standard forced-choice question as an
indicator of the deliberate- and effortfulness of the pertinent decision processes. It was
found that women selecting emotional infidelity made their decision significantly faster
than women selecting sexual infidelity. Analogously, men selecting sexual infidelity made
their decision significantly faster than men selecting emotional infidelity. From an
evolutionary view, these findings suggest that women selecting emotional infidelity and

men selecting sexual infidelity simply relied on their sex-specific initial response tendency
activated by the respective jealousy mechanism, whereas both women opting for sexual
infidelity and men opting for emotional infidelity needed to engage in more deliberate and
effortful decision processes to override their initial response tendency. Thus, contrary to
basic assumptions of DeSteno et al. (2002), (1) the forced-choice response format
apparently does not invariably induce the same deliberate and effortful decision processes
in all participants; (2) less effortful decision strategies do not reveal same-sex default
distress responses towards sexual infidelity but instead sex-specific initial response
tendencies for men (sexual infidelity) and women (emotional infidelity); (3) suggesting an
asymmetry in decision strategies in the forced-choice response format which is not
associated with the participants' sex as implied by DeSteno et al. (2002) but which within
each sex is associated with the final choice (Schützwohl, 2004). Moreover, Schützwohl
(2005) reported that men were significantly faster than women in deciding whether
infidelity cues would elicit either a first pang of jealousy or intolerable jealousy if these
cues were more diagnostic of sexual jealousy. Conversely, women made these decisions
significantly more rapidly than men for cues more diagnostic of emotional infidelity.
Together with the pronounced sex differences in particular in the present no-load condition
with time pressure but without distraction, these findings suggest that the sex differences
obtained with the forced-choice task are due to fast, spontaneous decisions rather than long
deliberation (see also Penke and Asendorpf, in press).
Third, DeSteno et al. (2002) failed to provide any theoretical argument to
substantiate their assumption that men and women share the same initial tendency towards
sexual infidelity as that infidelity type generating more jealousy. Fourth, in a similar vein,
these authors have yet to offer an explanation as to why women but not men should be
affected in their decisions by the different response formats.
Finally, the present findings contribute to the accumulating evidence that in rating
studies of jealousy reactions to sexual and emotional infidelity, the evolutionary prediction
of between-sex differences is consistently supported for emotional but not for sexual
infidelity (Penke and Asendorpf, in press). One exception to this pattern has been recently
presented by Schützwohl (in press b) with respect to ratings of relief about the
disconfirmation of the prospect of a mate's sexual and emotional infidelity. In two studies,
men reported more relief than women about the disconfirmation of the prospect of sexual
infidelity. Additionally, women consistently reported more relief about the disconfirmation
of emotional than of sexual infidelity. Thus, one important aim of future research will be to
explore potential causes for men's and women's different ratings patterns for jealousy and
relief in response to the (dis-)confirmation of a mate's sexual and emotional infidelity.
