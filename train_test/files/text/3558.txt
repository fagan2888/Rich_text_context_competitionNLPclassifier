2 The aim of the present study was to compare genotoxicity induced by high- versus very low dose-rate
exposure of mice to  -radiation within a dose range of 5 to 61 cGy using the single-cell gel electrophore-
sis (comet) assay and the micronucleus test. CBA/lac male mice were irradiated at a dose rate of
28.2 Gy/h (high dose rate) or 0.07 mGy/h (very low dose rate). The comet assay study on spleen
lymphocytes showed that very low dose-rate irradiation resulted in a statistically significant increase
in nucleoid relaxation (DNA breaks), starting from a dose of 20 cGy. Further prolongation of expo-
sure time and, hence, increase of a total dose did not, however, lead to further increase in the extent
of nucleoid relaxation. Doses of 20 and 61 cGy were equal in inducing DNA breaks in mouse spleen
lymphocytes as assayed by the comet assay. Of note, the level of DNA damage by 20­61 cGy doses of
chronic irradiation (0.07 mGy/h) was similar to that an induced by an acute (28.2 Gy/h) dose of
14 cGy. The bone marrow micronucleus test revealed that an increase in polychromatic erythrocytes
with micronuclei over a background level was induced by very low-level  -irradiation with a dose
of 61 cGy only, with the extent of the cytogenetic effect being similar to that of 10 cGy high-dose-rate
exposure. In summary, presented results support the hypothesis of the nonlinear threshold nature of
mutagenic action of chronic low dose-rate irradiation.

INTRODUCTION
All living organisms, including humans, are continuously exposed to ion-
izing radiation (IR) from natural sources. However, development of nuclear
technologies and associated intentional (e.g., Hiroshima and Nagasaki) and
accidental (e.g., Chernobyl) releases of radioisotopes have led to an increase

in a background level of IR. This technogenic part of IR exposure has risen
significantly over the past few decades.
Although there are no doubts about the negative biological effects of
high-dose IR, debates about whether low-dose IR exposure is harmful or
beneficial (hormetic) still continue in the scientific community. Analysis
of available literature indicates that low-dose IR exposure induces a com-
plex of biochemical and biophysical reactions in animals (Calabrese and
Baldwin, 2000; Mothersill and Seymour, 2003). It is not clear, however,
whether those changes are consequences of organism adaptation to increase
in IR background, and whether low doses cause any significant genetic
alterations.
The aim of the present study was to compare genotoxicity induced by
high- versus very low dose-rate exposure of mice to  -radiation within a dose
range of 5 to 61 cGy using the single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay
and the micronucleus test.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In chronic IR exposure experiments, 4­5-week-old CBA/lac male mice
weighting 12­14 g (purchased from Pitomnik-Stolbovaya) were used. Mice
were placed in plastic cages 14 days prior to IR exposure. Distribution of
animals into control and experimental groups was random. Mice were given
standard dry feed and water ad libitum. Experiments with chronic low dose-
rate irradiation were carried out from 2000 to 2003. Two independent ex-
periments with identical conditions were performed, utilizing a total of 280
mice (140 animals in each of the two experiments).
Experimental animals were chronically exposed to IR from a  -ray unit
"UOG-1" (VNIIFTRI, Russia) equipped with a 137Cs source (activity 7.2 ×
108 Bq) mounted in a steel container and specifically designed for long-
term irradiation of biological objects. The IR source was placed above ex-
posed targets. Chronic irradiation of animals was performed at a dose rate
of 0.07 mGy/h (distance from mouse bedding to the  -radiation source was
64 cm, filter-lens #5). Variability of a dose rate within the area to be irradiated
(1 m2) did not increase over 10%. Irradiation was continuous with 10­15 min
daily break for hygiene procedures. Control dosimetry was performed using
thermoluminescent detectors TLD-100 (Sweden) and DTG-4 (Russia). To
deliver to animals total cumulative doses of 6.7, 13.4, 20.2, 35.3, 45.4, and
61.3 cGy, low dose-rate irradiation was performed for 40, 80, 120, 210, 270,
and 365 days, respectively.
In an experiment with acute (high-dose-rate)  -irradiation, 3­4-month-
old CBA/lac male mice weighing 22­26 g were used. The total number of
mice used for acute irradiation experiments was 120. Irradiation was per-
formed using the Panorama-3C device equipped with four mobile 137Cs
sources (4.5 × 1013 Bq each) producing a dose rate of 28.2 Gy/h.
Genotoxic Action of High- Versus Very-Low-Dose-Rate  -Irradiation 225
Upon completion of chronic low dose-rate or acute irradiation, mice were
sacrificed and spleen and red bone marrow were removed and processed
for subsequent analysis. Suspension of spleen cells in phosphate-buffered
saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.14 M NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and 3 mM NaN3, was
filtered through nylon mesh at 4C. Cell concentrations were counted using
a hemocytometer.
Alkali single-cell gel electrophoresis was carried out as described by Singh
et al. (1988). According to the assay, the number of alkali labile sites and single-
strand breaks (SSBs) is proportional to the number of DNA fragments and to
the distance that DNA migrated from the nucleus after alkali electrophoresis
of agarose-immobilized single cells. Fluorescent dye Hoechst 33258 (Sigma
Chemical Co, St. Louis, MO) was used to visualize DNA. Analysis was per-
formed using the "Lumam I-2" fluorescent microscope (LOMO, Russia).
One hundred comets were counted from each slide. Comets were divided
into classes 0­4 (0 corresponded to no visible tail, 4 corresponded to total
migration of DNA from the nucleus into the tail) depending on the shape
(diameter, tail length, etc.). This method of visual damage is considered a
valid means of DNA damage analysis (Kobayashi et al., 1995). Results of the
visual classification were subsequently confirmed using the analytic package
image analysis software (Kinetic Imaging, Liverpool, UK).
A number of comets in each class was recorded and the average comet
index (ACI) was calculated as ACI = (1 · n1
+2 · n2
+3 · n3
+4 · n4)/ , where
n1
- n4 is a number of comets in classes 1­4, and is the sum of counted
comets, including comets in class 0.
The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by the DNA diffusion
assay described elsewhere (Singh, 2000).
For cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells by the micronucleus test,
cytological slides were prepared using standard procedure (Schmidt, 1975).
Polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) with micronuclei (MN) were recognized
and counted as described by Zaichkina et al. (1998). Three thousand PCEs
were analyzed from each mouse.
Statistical analysis of experimental results was performed using the stu-
dent t-test. Results are presented as averages for a dose group of animals (20
mice per dose group for chronic irradiation, and 10 mice per dose group for
acute irradiation) ± standard errors.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1 shows the results of the ACI determination in spleen lympho-
cytes from mice exposed to acute and chronic (very low dose-rate) IR. Data
are presented as differences of the ACI in irradiated and untreated con-
trol groups. A dose-response curve after acute IR exposure is perfectly fit-
ted by a linear regression ACI = a + 0.049  D, where a is the ACI value in
the control group, and D is a dose in cGy. Depending on cell type, and

proliferative and metabolic activity rate, the ACI in control animals varied
within 0.2­1.
Using the BALB/c mouse strain, we have previously shown that the dose-
response curve of initially induced DNA SSBs in mouse spleen lymphocytes
after acute IR exposure is linear in the range 5­50 cGy with the similar
ACI = a + 0.042 · D (Mayzin et al., 2002).
In contrast to acute IR exposure, chronic low dose-rate irradiation re-
sulted in a nonlinear dose-response curve (Figure 1). In the range of about
7 to 20 cGy (40­120 days), the ACI increased linearly. Further accumulation
of a dose did not, however, lead to further increase in the ACI. Its value
did not significantly change within a dose range of 20 to 61 cGy. These re-
sults suggest that the dose-response curve of DNA SSBs formation in mouse
spleen lymphocytes after in vivo chronic  -irradiation (0.07 mGy/h) contains
a "plateau" section that is not observed in cases with acute  -irradiation.
Because long periods of irradiation time can significantly change the
ACI value in a control group, interfering with accurate evaluation of the pa-
rameter in an exposure group, the ACI values were recorded throughout all
experimental time (Table 1). The ACI value decreased with age of animals,

probably due to decrease in proliferation rate of spleen lymphocytes. Nev-
ertheless, starting from 40 and up to 270 days of the experiment (the main
experimental points), ACI values did not significantly change, confirming
that our way of presenting the results is accurate.
It is well known that some background level of DNA breakage is always
present in mammalian cells due to normal metabolism. These breaks can be
divided into two classes:
1. breaks resulting from DNA damage by free radicals produced by cellular
oxygen metabolism; and
2. breaks resulting from DNA replication, repair, transcription processes, as
well as chromatin condensation and decondensation.
An IR dose of 1 Gy induces approximately 1000 DNA SSBs per cell (Billen,
1990). Simple calculations based on these data show that irradiation with a
dose rate of 0.07 mGy/h (0.17 cGy/day) will induce about two DNA SSBs
per cell per day, whereas a number of endogenous SSBs resulting from normal
oxygen metabolism is 1.2 × 105 per cell per day (Billen, 1990). It is, there-
fore, obvious that low dose-rate IR-induced DNA SSBs can hardly influence a
total number of DNA breaks. The nature of spontaneous and induced DNA
breaks is rather similar. IR-induced primary lesions could lead to genotoxic
effects only if the spatial distribution of the lesions along the chromatin and
effectiveness of their repair is different from those spontaneously induced.
Studies of the past decade suggest that particular areas within chromatin pos-
sessing hypersensitivity to IR do exist (Oleinick et al., 1994). Double-stranded
DNA clusters composed of multiple lesions on opposing DNA strands within
a few helical turns are of particular danger to cells, because it is hard for
DNA repair machinery to repair them (Goodhead, 1994). These clusters are
thought to be crucial IR-induced DNA lesions leading to double-stand breaks
(DSBs), and eventually to mutagenesis and cell death (Ahnstrom and Bryant,
1982). Sutherland et al. (2002) demonstrated that as low as 10 cGy IR caused
an increase in clustered DNA damage level in human monocytes. Consistent
with our results, nondividing primary human fibroblasts exposed to 1 mGy of
IR were not able to repair DNA DSBs for several days, whereas effectiveness
of DSB repair after higher doses was much better (Rothkamm and Lobrich,
2003).
A minor part of cells that have an extremely high level of DNA damage
(e.g., apoptotic cells) would supposedly contribute substantially to an overall
DNA damage level within an entire cellular population. To take into account
the contribution of an apoptotic cell subpopulation to a final readout of DNA
breaks in our experiments, we measured the percentage of apoptotic spleen
lymphocytes from mice exposed to very low dose-rate IR or untreated animals
using the "DNA diffusion" assay. At days 120, 270, and 365 of the chronic irra-
diation (20, 45, and 61 cGy, respectively), an approximately twofold increase

over a control level in the apoptotic cell fraction was observed (Table 2). As
expected, a correlation (r = 0.86; p < 0.05) between an overall level of DNA
damage and percentage of apoptotic cells was noticed. These observations
prompted us to recalculate overall DNA damage levels (the ACI coefficient)
in irradiated versus untreated groups. When performed without counting
highly damaged cells (comets within classes 3 and 4), the comet assay yielded
less, but still statistically significant, difference in DNA damage levels between
irradiated (20­61 cGy) and untreated mice (data not shown). The appear-
ance of apoptotic cells with highly fragmented DNA in irradiated animals
cannot, therefore, have a direct impact on overall level of DNA strand breaks.
An indirect mechanism, also known as a "bystander effect," a response of unir-
radiated cells due to signaling originating from irradiated cells (Hall, 2003),
can possibly be involved in the effects observed in this study. In this scenario,
lesions within supersensitive chromatin regions in a minor, apoptotic cell
population appear to trigger a cascade of metabolic processes in different
cell populations on both organ and organism levels. Bystander effects have
been demonstrated after both low-linear energy transfer (LET) and high-
linear energy transfer (LET) IR exposures (Mothersill et al., 2002). A signal
from irradiated cells can be transmitted by direct intercellular contacts (gap
junction communications), as well as by cytokines and/or oxygen species
secreted by irradiated cells (Lorimore and Wright, 2003). In our previous
study, using mammalian cultured cells, we showed that low IR doses induced
production and secretion of the ApoJ lipoprotein involved in the bystander ef-
fect by regulating expression of genes downstream of the TFG-beta signaling
pathway (Klokov et al., n.d.). A variety of changes has been reported to oc-
cur in bystander cells, including overproduction of free radicals (Narayanan
et al., 1997; Leach et al., 2001); induction of stress-related kinases such as
JNK, ERK1/2, and others (Little et al., 2002); and cytokines Beta1-integrin

and IL-1alpha (Osterreicher et al., 2003). In addition, reactive oxygen species
(ROS) can act as signal molecules to propagate and regulate a particular cel-
lular response such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Lehnert
and Iyer, 2002). It is well known that actively transcribed DNA sequences are
much more susceptible to DNA damage than those in compact chromatin
regions due to unlimited accessibility of them for ROS (Chiu et al., 1982;
Warters et al., 1987). An increase in actively transcribed genes, together with
an increase in ROS production can, therefore, lead to elevated DNA damage.
On the other hand, DNA damage within active genes is repaired faster and
more efficiently compared to that in silent genes (Oleinick et al., 1984; Bohr,
1987).
Our speculation is supported by results of monitoring reparative and
replicative DNA syntheses in mouse bone marrow cells reported by Mazurik
et al. (2002), within a collaborative effort with our group, performed on
the same mice used in our present study. The authors demonstrated that
chronic low dose-rate irradiation of mice substantially induced reparative
and replicative DNA syntheses in bone marrow cells (60 and 67% increase;
p < 0.01, p < 0.01, respectively). As mentioned earlier, activation of DNA
replication and repair is associated with increase in the DNA strand-breaks
level. Besides, significant positive correlation (r = 0.87; p < 0.01) between
DNA strand breaks and superoxide anion-radical content in bone marrow
cells of the irradiated mice was shown, indicating additional production of
DNA damage by ROS due to the loss of a part of structural proteins and
conformational changes in expression sites of the chromatin during gene
expression (Mazurik et al., 2002).
It was suggested that the bystander effect has an alternative protective
feature due to elimination of highly damaged, potentially dangerous cells
from a cell population (Belyakov et al., 2002; Prise et al., 2002). In accor-
dance with this line of evidence, an adaptive response, an effect of increased
radioresistance to high IR doses acquired after exposure to low doses, was
associated with overproduction of ROS (Lehnert and Iyer, 2002). In our pre-
vious study, we demonstrated that an increase in DNA breaks level by days
120­365 of low-level IR exposure is accompanied by elevated radioresistance
to hydrogen peroxide treatment (Osipov et al., 2002). It was suggested that
the elevated cell radioresistance could be explained by either activation of
DNA repair or elimination of a supersensitive cell population (Osipov et al.,
2002).
Thus, overall increase in the level of DNA breaks in mouse spleen lym-
phocytes as a result of chronic low dose-rate IR exposure can possibly be
explained by structural rearrangement of the chromatin during gene ex-
pression activation, free radical overproduction, and DNA repair activation.
Although insignificant, a contribution of apoptotic cells to an overall level of
DNA damage was also recorded, providing further support for the proposed
230 A. N. Osipov et al.
mechanisms of low dose-rate radiation-induced cytogenetic effects observed
in this study.
The mutagenic effect in PCEs was determined using the micronucleus
test. MN are acentric chromosomal fragments or whole chromosomes lost
during mitosis as a result of DNA damage. As expected, an increase in the
portion of PCEs with MN in aging mice was observed, which correlates with a
well-established age-related accumulation of mutations in bone marrow cells
(Table 3).
Dose-response curves for frequency of PCEs with MN in mouse bone
marrow upon IR with two different dose rates are presented in Figure 2. The
dose-response curve upon acute IR exposure is described by a linear function
and is consistent with results obtained by other investigators using different
mouse strains (Uma Devi and Sharma, 1990; Jagetia and Ganapathi, 1994;
Sudheer Kumar et al., 2003). The genetic background of the mice seems
to be an important factor for cytogenetic studies and interpretations. Our
previous data generated in experiments with SHK mice indicated that the
dose-response curve for cytogenetic damage in bone marrow cells was de-
scribed by a step function and consisted of two linear regions and a "plateau"
between them in the range 10­35 cGy (Zaichkina et al., 1998). In contrast,
chronic low dose-rate exposure did not result in an increase in cytogenetic
damage up to 61 cGy, with the damage induced by 61 cGy being comparable
with that induced by acute IR doses of 10 cGy. Using this assay, therefore,
mutagenic activity of chronic IR exposure with a dose rate of 0.07 mGy/h
was at least six-fold lower than that of acute IR exposure with a dose rate of
28.2 Gy/h. In addition, our results indicate a threshold in the dose­effect
relationship after chronic IR exposure with a dose rate of 0.07 mGy/h. The
threshold was observed to extend up to 35­61 cGy.

(28.2 Gy/h) or chronic very low dose-rate (0.07 mGy/h) IR. Data are presented after subtraction of
control (untreated) values from experimental (irradiated) values.
Genotoxic Action of High- Versus Very-Low-Dose-Rate  -Irradiation 231
To summarize, chronic IR exposure of three orders over a normal back-
ground level leads to a statistically significant increase in the number of DNA
strand breaks within a 20­61-cGy dose range. More probably, this increase
can be associated with the chromatin rearrangement accompanied by gene
overexpression, increase in ROS production rate, and DNA repair activation,
processes known to be triggered after low doses of IR. Six times higher dose
of chronic 0.07 mGy/h IR exposure was required to induce cytogenetic dam-
age in bone marrow cells comparable to that after acute 28.2 Gy/h exposure.
Based on these results, we can suggest that mutagenic activity of chronic irra-
diation of three orders over the normal background level is at least six times
lower than that of acute irradiation. Data on MN induction support the hy-
pothesis of the nonlinear threshold nature of mutagenic action of chronic
low dose-rate irradiation.
