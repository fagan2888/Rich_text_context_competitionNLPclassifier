Abstract
Objective: To investigate the effect of anticoagulant treatment on pregnancy outcomes in patients
with previous recurrent miscarriages (RM) who carry a methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase
(MTHFR) gene mutation.
Methods: In this longitudinal retrospective study, patients with RM were treated during pregnancy
with either: (i) 100 mg/day aspirin and 5 mg/day folic acid (group 1); or the same protocol plus
0.4 mg/day enoxaparin (group 2). An age-matched group of triparous women without RM or
thrombophilia was used as the control group (group 3).
Results: This study enrolled 246 women with RM (123 per treatment group) and age-matched
controls (n ¼ 117). The delivery rate was significantly lower in group 1 than group 2 (46.3% versus
79.7%, respectively). The miscarriage rate was significantly lower in group 2 compared with group 1
(20.3% versus 51.2%, respectively). In the control group 3, the delivery rate was 86.3% and the
miscarriage rate was 12.8%.

Introduction
Recurrent miscarriage (RM) is defined as
three or more consecutive spontaneous fetal
losses and it affects 0.3% to 1% of pregnan-
cies.1 After one miscarriage, the mean risk of
recurrence is 20%; after two, three or four
miscarriages, the rate rises to 28%, 30% and
45%, respectively.2 However, 25­50% of
RM cases are idiopathic.3 Several studies
have described correlations between RM
and thrombophilia,4­6 which comprises of:
(i) hereditary conditions linked to deficien-
cies in natural coagulation inhibitors
(antithrombin III, proteins S and C) or
mutations in the methylenetetrahydrofolate
reductase (MTHFR), prothrombin (muta-
tion G20210A) or factor V Leiden genes;
and (ii) acquired conditions such as antipho-
spholipid antibody syndrome and patients
that produce lupus anticoagulants.5
The MTHFR enzyme plays a key role in
the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahy-
drofolate to 5-methylenetetrahydrofolate,
which provides the single-carbon for homo-
cysteine in methionine synthesis.7 The single
nucleotide polymorphism C677T encoded
by rs1801133 results in an alanine to valine
substitution at amino acid 222 in the
MTHFR enzyme.7 The activity of the
MTHFR enzyme is reduced by 35% in
people who are 677CT carriers (heterozy-
gosity) and by 70% among 677TT carriers
(homozygosity).7 A reduction in the enzyme
activity decreases the conversion of
homocysteine into methionine, subsequently
resulting in homocysteine (Hcy) accumula-
tion in the blood.7 Hyperhomocysteinaemia
(HHcy) has been shown to be caused by
both enzyme deficiencies (MTHFR) and
environmental factors related to the lack of
cofactors in methionine metabolism (vita-
mins B6 and B12 and folic acid).7 Folic acid
is an essential factor for the growing placen-
tal tissue and it acts as a substrate for the
metabolism of several amino acids and is
involved in the transmethylation pathway.8
MTHFR also maintains the methyl pool for
the control of gene expression by DNA
methylation during implantation and inva-
sion of the embryo in the first trimester of
pregnancy.9,10 A previous study showed that
a homozygous MTHFR gene mutation led
to a 3.3-fold increase in the risk of miscar-
riage in a population of 185 Caucasian
women relative to 113 mutation-free
controls.11
There is little consensus regarding
the effect of preventive treatment with
low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH),
with some studies reporting a positive
effect in patients withRMandthrombophi-
lia,12­14 but with other studies showing no
effect.15­17 The aim of this present study was
to compare the effect of treatment with a
combination of aspirin, LMWH and folic
acid versus a combination of aspirin and
folic acid in women with consecutive first-
trimester recurrent miscarriages who were
carrying a C677T MTHFR gene mutation.

Patients and methods
Patient population
This longitudinal retrospective study
enrolled consecutive patients with three or
more consecutive first-trimester miscar-
riages who were carrying the C677T
MTHFR gene mutation and were treated
and followed-up by the Department of
Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Reproductive
Medicine, Amiens University Medical
Centre, Amiens, France between January
2006 and December 2011. The C677CT
(heterozygosity) and C677TT (homozygos-
ity) mutations were the only MTHFR gene
mutations considered in this study. Patients
with the A1298C polymorphism were
excluded. All enrolled women were screened
for uterine malformations (by hystero-
scopy), chromosomal abnormalities (karyo-
type, also undertaken for their male
partner), endocrine disorders (fasting and
post-prandial blood glucose, thyroid
hormones) and thrombophilia. Table 1 sum-
marizes the thrombophilia criteria screened
for each patient and the age-matched con-
trol subjects. A fasting blood homocysteine
level > 15 mmol/l was considered to be
pathological and defined as HHcy. The
MTHFR gene mutations of the patient's
male partner were not genotyped.
An age-matched group of triparous
women without RM and thrombophilia
(screened for thrombophilia as for the two
study groups) who became pregnant during
the same time period and followed-up in the
same hospital was used as the control group.
Baseline demographic and clinical data
were collected for all study participants,
including previous number of pregnancies,
number of first-trimester miscarriages,
previous intra-uterine fetal death, previous
pre-eclampsia, previous intra-uterine
growth restriction, previous successful deliv-
eries, body mass index (kg/m2), HHcy
status, alcohol consumption status defined
as any alcohol consumed per day and
smoking status defined as >five cigarettes
per day.
All study participants gave their written,
informed consent and the study protocol
was approved by the Picardie University
Jules Verne Bioethics Committee, Amiens
University Medical Centre, Amiens, France.
MTHFR genotyping
Screening for the C677T MTHFR gene
mutation was performed according to a
method described previously.18 Briefly, gen-
omic DNA was extracted from peripheral
blood using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according
to the manufacturer's protocol. Blood
samples were stored at ­80C prior to ana-
lysis. Genotyping was performed by poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction
fragment length polymorphism or real-time
PCR. Amplification of the c.677C > T
region of the MTHFR gene was performed
using the primer pairs 50-TGAAGGAGAA

-30 (reverse primer) as described previ-
ously.18 PCR amplifications (25 ml volume)
consisted of the following: 5 ng of genomic
DNA in the case of patients and controls;
10 pmol each of the c.677C > T forward and
reverse primers; 0.625 units of Taq DNA
polymerase (5 PRIME, Hamburg,
Germany); 0.2 mM of dNTPs (Thermo
Scientific, Colchester, UK) in 1 Â PCR
Buffer (5 PRIME). Amplification of the
correct fragment was initially confirmed by
unidirectional DNA sequencing followed by
comparison and alignment to the NCBI
Reference Sequence NG_013351.1.
The PCR was followed by minisequen-
cing as described previously with some
modifications.7 Prior to the minisequencing
reaction, 0.5 ml of PCR product was purified
using ExoSAP-ITÕ PCR Product Cleanup
(Affymetrix UK, High Wycombe, UK) fol-
lowing the manufacturer's instructions.
Minisequencing was then conducted in a
final volume of 5 ml, consisting of 0.5 ml of
each of the purified MTHFR c.677C > T
PCR products, 2.5 ml SNaPshotÕ Multiplex
Ready Reaction Mix (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) and 1 pmol of
each of the minisequencing primers for
MTHFR c.677C > T: 50-TGAAGGAGAA
GGTGTCTGCGGGA-30 (forward primer);
and 50- AGGACGGTGCGGGAGAGTC-
30 (reverse primer). The cycling programme
involved preliminary denaturation at 95C
for 10 min, followed by 25 cycles of denatur-
ation at 96C for 10 s, annealing at 50C for
5 s, and elongation at 60C for 30 s, fol-
lowed by a final elongation step at 72C
for 7 min. Minisequencing products were
analysed by capillary electrophoresis on an
Applied BiosystemsÕ3130 Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems). The reaction included
9.25 ml Hi-DiTM Formamide (Applied
Biosystems), 0.25 ml GeneScanTM 1200
LIZÕ dye Size Standard (Applied
Biosystems) and 0.5 ml of minisequencing
product. Incubation at 95C for 3 min to
denature the minisequencing product was
performed prior to electrophoresis. Data
were subsequently visualized and analysed
using the GeneMapperÕ Software version
X3.4 (Applied Biosystems).
Study treatment groups
This study undertook retrospective analyses
of two groups of patients with the C677T
MTHFR gene mutation who had been
treated with two different protocols during
two different time periods. The first group of
patients (group 1) was treated between
January 2006 and December 2008 with
protocol P1 that consisted of the following:
low-dose aspirin (AspegicÕ, 100 mg/day;
Sanofi, Gentilly, France) prior to conception
and up until 35 weeks of amenorrhoea; and
folic acid (SpeciaFoldineÕ, 5 mg/day;
Theraplix, Paris, France) as soon as preg-
nancy was confirmed and up until delivery.
Because of the unsatisfactory results with
the P1 protocol, the P2 protocol was
introduced for patients having the same
characteristics as group 1. Patients in
group 2 were treated between January 2009
and December 2011 with protocol P2 that
consisted of the following: low-dose aspirin
(AspegicÕ, 100 mg/day; Sanofi) prior to
conception and up until 35 weeks of amen-
orrhoea; and folic acid (SpeciaFoldineÕ,
5 mg/day; Theraplix) as soon as pregnancy
was confirmed and up until delivery;
combined with a LMWH (enoxaparin, sub-
cutaneous injection; LovenoxÕ, 0.4 mg/day;
Aventis, Paris, France) as soon as pregnancy
was confirmed (by a plasma b-human
chorionic gonadotropin assay) and up until
delivery. The two active treatment groups
were compared with an age-matched control
group (group 3). The control group was
permitted to receive any antithrombotic and
vitamin treatments that were considered
necessary by their physicians. Fetal devel-
opment was routinely monitored and no
Merviel et al. 1723
differences were observed between the three
groups. During pregnancy, each woman in
the three groups received the same standard
obstetric care and pregnancy monitoring,
with a platelet count control if heparin was
prescribed.
Study outcomes
The following pregnancy outcomes in the
three groups were analysed: maternal age at
start of pregnancy, number of successful
deliveries, duration of pregnancy (weeks of
amenorrhoea), infant birth weight, and patho-
logical outcomes including first-trimester
miscarriage, intra-uterine fetal death,
pre-eclampsia and/or intra-uterine growth
restriction (<fifth percentile), and premature
deliveries (under 37 weeks of amenorrhoea).
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the StatView statistical package, version
5.0.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA)
for WindowsÕ. Comparisons between the
three groups of patients were undertaken
using Student's t-test or Mann­Whitney
U-test for continuous variables
(mean Æ SD) and 2-test or Fisher's exact
test for the first-trimester miscarriage and
delivery rates. A P-value < 0.05 was con-
sidered to be statistically significant.
Results
This longitudinal retrospective study
enrolled 246 women with three or more
consecutive first-trimester recurrent miscar-
riages who were carrying the C677T
MTHFR gene mutation. Of these, 171
(69.5%) women were 677CT heterozygotes
and 75 (30.5%) women were 677TT homo-
zygotes. None of the 677CT women was
classified as having HHcy compared with 22
(29.3%) of the 75 677TT women who were
classified as having HHcy (12 of 123 [9.8%]
in group 1 compared with 10 of 123 [8.1%]
in group 2; no significant between-group
difference). The 246 women who were
carrying the C677T MTHFR gene mutation
formed the two treatment groups (groups 1
and 2; n ¼ 123 per group). The age-matched
control group consisted of 117 pregnant
women. The baseline characteristics, obstet-
ric antecedents and C677T MTHFR gene
mutation status for the three groups of
patients are presented in Table 2. There
were no significant differences between the
baseline characteristics of the three groups
including body mass index, cigarette con-
sumption and alcohol consumption. In the
246 women with the C677T MTHFR gene
mutation, before any preventive treatment,
941 first-trimester miscarriages were
reported (mean 3.8 per woman; range 3­15),
with no significant difference being observed
in the distribution of miscarriages between
the two treatment groups (Table 2).
The pregnancy-related outcomes of the
three groups are summarized in Table 3.
There were no significant differences
between the three groups in terms of age at
the start of the pregnancy. In group 1, 57
women gave birth (including six premature
deliveries) after a mean Æ SD pregnancy
duration of 37.4 Æ 3.2 weeks of amenor-
rhoea. The mean Æ SD infant birth weight
was 2820 Æ 585 g. In group 2, 98 births
occurred (including seven premature
deliveries), with a mean Æ SD pregnancy
duration of 39.1 Æ 3.7 weeks of amenor-
rhoea (group 1 versus group 2; P < 0.001)
and a mean Æ SD infant birth weight of
3372 Æ 167 g (group 1 versus group 2;
P < 0.001). The delivery rate was signifi-
cantly higher in group 2 versus group 1
(79.7% versus 46.3%; P < 0.001). The first-
trimester miscarriage rate was significantly
higher in group 1 compared with group 2
(51.2% versus 20.3%, respectively;
P < 0.001). There was no significant differ-
ence in the first-trimester miscarriage rates
between the two treatment groups (group 1

status (6/12 [50.0%] in group 1 versus 2/10
[20.0%] in group 2). No heparin-induced
thrombopenia or iatrogenic bleeding
occurred during administration of the P2
protocol. In the control group 3, 101 live
births (including eight premature deliveries)
were recorded. The meanÆ SD infant birth

Discussion
This present study observed a significant
effect on miscarriage prevention in patients
with a C677T MTHFR gene mutation when
a treatment combination of aspirin, LMWH
and folic acid was used. To increase the
power of this present study, a control group
of triparous women without RM and
thrombophilia were used and they demon-
strated a similar delivery rate compared with
the group of C677T women treated with
aspirin, LMWH and folic acid (86.3%
versus 79.7%, respectively). A previous
study showed a pregnancy salvage rate of
43.1% with aspirin alone in women with
RM and a rescue of 66.8% pregnancies with
aspirin-LMWH therapy in the aspirin-failed
cases.19 This previous result was in relation
to the HHcy status in women with polycystic
ovary syndrome, insulin resistance and
obesity.19 In the present study, only 8.9%
of women had HHcy (22 women with the
677TT mutation and none of those with
the 677CT mutation), so this status was not
the explanation for the preventive effect of
the combined therapy of aspirin, LMWH
and folic acid. However, the administration
of 5 mg/day folic acid could have normalized
the homocysteine level, but this treatment
was undertaken in both groups 1 and 2.
HHcy increases the monocyte secretion of
procoagulants and cytokines (e.g. interleu-
kin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant pro-
tein-1), which attract white blood cells and
contribute to an alteration of the endothe-
lium that results in venous thrombosis and
placental insufficiency.20 In a review of the
literature on HHcy that included 35 studies
with a total of 7167 patients, first-trimester
miscarriages were shown to be associated
with HHcy with a relative risk (RR) of 6.25
(95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37, 28.42).21
In contrast, this hypothesis was not sup-
ported by two other studies that showed
that: (i) homocysteine levels did not appear
to be related to the MTHFR genotype; and
(ii) first-trimester RM also occurred in
patients with normal plasma homocysteine
levels.22,23 In a study of 200 Tunisian women
with three or more previous miscarriages
(n ¼ 726, between 7 and 32 weeks of amen-
orrhoea) and 200 control women free of fetal
loss or complications of pregnancy, the
frequency of CT or TT MTHFR gene muta-
tions was significantly higher in the RM
group than in the control group
(P < 0.001).24
The negative effect of MTHFR gene
mutations on RM remains the subject of
considerable debate. Different studies have
demonstrated higher frequencies of
MTHFR mutations in cases of RM,25­28
with a RR for 677TT between 1.4 (95% CI
1, 2)10 and 3.7 (95% CI 1.2, 11.8). In
contrast, two other studies failed to find a
relationship between the C677T MTHFR
gene polymorphism and RM.29,30 Recently,
a large meta-analysis (3559 RM versus 5097
controls) reported an odds ratio of 1.68 for
677TT versus total genotypes (95% CI 1.32,
2.13; P < 0.0001), 1.35 for 677CT and
677TT genotypes combined versus total
genotypes (95% CI 1.04, 1.76; P ¼ 0.0224)
and 1.34 for T versus total alleles (95% CI
1.13, 1.58; P ¼ 0.0008).31
This present study hypothesized that only
C677T MTHFR gene mutations without
HHcy (91% of the women did have not
HHcy) could be linked to RM by defective
utero-placental vascularization and tropho-
blast apoptosis. At the start of pregnancy
1726 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
(between 5 and 8 weeks of amenorrhoea),
the uterine spiral arteries are obstructed by
plugs of trophoblasts, which are essential for
subsequent development of the pregnancy.
From 8 to 13 weeks of amenorrhoea
onwards, disaggregation of the plugs
prompts the second migration of tropho-
blasts into the maternal arteries and the
invasion of the myometrial spiral uterine
artery wall (disappearance of the notch).32
In cases of thrombotic factors such as
C677T MTHFR gene mutations, clots
form upstream of the plugs and persist
after plug disaggregation, leading to a
blockage of the chorionic villous vascular-
ization and the absence of the second
trophoblast migration (Figure 1).32 These
anomalies are associated with an increase
of pregnancy-associated vascular patholo-
gies, such as pre-eclampsia, vascular intra-
uterine growth restriction and placenta
abruption;33,34 and a higher frequency of
C677T MTHFR gene mutations was found
in patients presenting with these
pathologies.35
With regard to preventing RM, because
antithrombotic treatment in thrombophilic
pregnant women with previous RM has
been shown to improve their pregnancy-
related prognosis,36­38 the possibility of
starting early antithrombotic treatment has
been studied. However, the results of several
studies were very different when comparing
enoxaparin versus placebo (live birth rate:
81% versus 41%, respectively)14 and versus
aspirin (86% versus 29%, respectively);13 or,
as in others studies, showed no difference
(95% versus 88% for enoxaparin versus
placebo, respectively;16 and 81% versus
84% for enoxaparin versus aspirin, respect-
ively).15 In these studies, many different
types of thrombophilia (V and II mutations,

cies) were included and could have explained
the variations of the results. In contrast, two
previous studies failed to report an effect of
heparin treatment in women with unex-
plained recurrent miscarriages.39,40
In the present study, when only women
with the C677T MTHFR gene polymorph-
ism were included, a significant effect of
LMWH was reported, as observed in other
studies.41,42 In a study of 351 women with
RM (12% of whom carried C677T MTHFR
gene mutations) and treated with aspirin
and LMWH until live birth term, a normal
pregnancy outcome was reported in 94% of
cases.41 During the follow-up of eight
patients who had experienced 20 first-
trimester abortions and had normal homo-
cysteine levels, preventive treatment with
LMWH from the beginning of pregnancy
onwards was evaluated.42 Three pregnancies
of theeight treatedpatientshadbeenachieved,
with two full-term births at the time of pub-
lication.42 The effect of combining treatment
with folic acid was previously evaluated in
women with HHcy and three or four previous
miscarriages.43 The study demonstrated that 1
month of treatment with 15mg/day folic acid
and 750 mg/day vitamin B6 led to a significant
decrease (>90%) in the risk of first-trimester
miscarriage.43 In contrast, folic acid supple-
mentation (0.4mg/day) in a population of
23 806 primiparous Chinese women did not
have a positive effect on miscarriage.44 In this
study, the miscarriage rate was the same
regardless of whether the patients were sup-
plemented or not (9.0% versus 9.3%, respect-
ively; RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.84, 1.12),44 which
was possibly due to the low dose of folic acid
used. In the present study, where all the
women received the same dose of folic acid
(5mg/day), the results showed that folic acid
was not sufficient to explain the difference in
the rate of RM.
In conclusion, the present study has
demonstrated that in women with recurrent
miscarriages who are carrying a C677T
MTHFR gene mutation, preventive treat-
ment with aspirin, LMWH and folic acid
was effective at increasing the delivery rate.
The benefit of anticoagulation did not
appear to be related to the thrombogenic
effect of homocysteine.
