Introduction
Childhood developmental delays and their sequelae are a
major public health concern for low-income countries.
Grantham-McGregor and colleagues (2007) state that many
children in developing countries are exposed to multiple
risks for poor development including poverty, poor health,
and nutrition. The conservative estimate is that more than
200 million children below 5 years of age in developing
countries are not developing to their full potential.
Developmental problems affect both developed and
developing countries. For example, in the United Kingdom,
an analysis of a cross-sectional survey of 16,000 children
aged 0 to 18 years revealed that 7.3% of children were
reported as having a developmental disability (Blackburn,
Read, & Spencer, 2010). In a comprehensive review done of
studies on disability covering intellectual, hearing, speech,
vision, motor, and neurologic impairment in low- and mid-
dle-income countries (Maulik & Darmstadt, 2007), a 12%
overall disability rate was reported among 2- to 9-year-old
children from one community-based study in India (n = 640).
Early identification of delays by screening is vital, as
interventions could make a big difference to the individual
and family, and place less demand on health expenditure
(Grantham-McGregor et al., 2007). Development screening
of a child is currently measured by a range of developmental
screening tests (Frankenburg et al., 1996). Developing coun-
tries face a big obstacle in systematic screening due to three
factors:
1. Established development screening tools need to be
validated to a country before being used.
2. Trained people are needed to administer them.
3. To identify developmental problems, a large number
of apparently normal children have to be examined.
These three factors require considerable expertise,
money, and time, all rare attributes in a developing
setup.

Abstract
The aim of this study was to develop a screening tool to screen children for development problems in a low-income setting.
Childhood development problems are a major health issue faced by low-income countries. A validated screening tool is
needed for early identification of developmental delays. This article contains the first phase of a study that established a
relatively simple tool to screen children for developmental problems. The aim of the first phase was to define a set of
development indicators for the period of 2 to 12 months of life. The study methodology consisted of an extensive literature
review, to develop a set of indicators to measure child development in infancy. The indicators were placed within a framework
developed and used by experts in other countries. It consists of major domains, subdomains, specific aspects, and standards
of development. This was followed by content validation of the indicators. Following review of literature, 171 indicators were
compiled under the framework. At the end of content validation, 125 indicators were retained in the framework. These
were pretested, and another 26 were removed following pretesting. The study developed a framework of indicators that
could be used as a development tool following a reference-based validation. The second phase of the study that included the
assessment of psychometric characteristics and reference-based validation would be published in a separate article.

To overcome these obstacles, middle- and low-income
countries need instruments that could be used in the field by
a primary health care worker or caregiver. Normative devel-
opment standards for young children called Early Child
Development Standards (ECDS) could serve this purpose.
Standards are statements that specify an expectation for
achievement of skills or knowledge that may be used as a
basis of comparison in measuring or judging capacity, qual-
ity, value, or quantity (Kagan & Britto, 2008).
The age at which development skills appear can be given
as a range. These ranges can be considered as age percen-
tiles. A percentile of a development indicator is the age a
particular skill is achievable by a percentage of children.
Based on the percentiles, norms can be defined. These norms
can be used to make relative assessment of children in rela-
tion to their level or status of development (Fernald, Kariger,
Engle, & Raikes, 2009).
Development of ECDS therefore consists of two
components:
1. development of a tool where early developmental
indicators are initially defined and placed in a devel-
opment framework, and
2. age validation of the tool to obtain ECDS.
The methods adopted to develop ECDS were recom-
mended in two global workshops held in Shanghai, China,
and Kathmandu, Nepal (Kagan & Britto, 2008), in collabora-
tion with the United Nations Children's Educational Fund
(UNICEF).
Aim
This report gives the first component of a study where a
series of early developmental indicators for children in sec-
ond to 12th months of life were defined and adapted to ensure
their content and cultural appropriateness.
Method
Development tools generally use a three- to four-domain
approach in categorizing the items. For example, the Bayley's
scale uses a three-domain approach (Motor, Cognitive, and
Language) in the main scale (Bayley, 2005). The Denver
Developmental Screening Test (Frankenburg et al., 1996)
uses a three-domain method as well. These scales do not fur-
ther subdivide the items. The present study further subdi-
vides the items and uses a hierarchy to place the items (refer
to Table 1). This hierarchy has been used by countries that
have addressed ECDS (Tennesse Department of Education.
(2013). In this, there are four domains of development, their
subdomains, specific aspects, standards, and indicators. The
four major subdomains were utilized as all major develop-
ment scales used this categorization. The items under the
major domains conformed to the placement of items found in
widely used scales such as the Bayley's and Denver
Developmental Tool. The subdomains are broad areas of the
domain. The specific aspects are the main components of
those subdomains. The standards are the expected skills that
depict the specific aspects. Standards are measured by the
final indicators. The indicators are very specific statements
that can be actually measured.
Once the skills are defined, they are made measurable by
converting them to indicators; hence, the final hierarchy of a
domain is given in Figure 1.
There are several steps involved in developing and vali-
dating an instrument. As the first step, an extensive review of
literature is needed to operationalize the construct to be mea-
sured (Benson & Clarke, 1982). When the construct is opera-
tionalized, the items that can measure the construct as
accurately as possible are identified. The team that devel-
oped the Denver Developmental Tool identified 336 items
initially as the components needed to measure development
(Frankenburg et al., 1996). In development of the Canadian
Early Development Index (EDI), the items for the EDI were
derived from existing instruments, key informant interviews,
and focus groups (Janus & Offord, 2007). Content validation
is the next step where the items and the table of specifica-
tions are given to a panel of experts who are asked to place
the items in the suitable grids within the table of specifica-
tions. When absolute agreement is not reached, the item is
revised until a consensus on its placement is reached.
Cronbach and Meehl (1955) state that content validity is
established by showing that the test items are a sample of a
universe in which the investigator is interested.
Development tools can either use an a priori structure to
categorize their indicators or an empirically driven method.
An empirically driven structure will decide on the categories
where the items will be placed following a mathematical
evaluation like factor analysis. Most of the widely used
scales like Bayley's scale have not used an empirically driven
method but utilized an a priori structure method. The Bayley
Scales of Infant Development II (BSID II) has been sub-
jected to factor analysis to explore the factor structure. For
example, one such study is the analysis carried out by
Thompson and others (Thompson et al., 1994). The authors
conclude that at a second-order factor analysis, the mental
and motor components emerge as discrete constructs.
Countries developing ECDS have all used an a priori struc-
ture method. The present study uses this method as well. The
authors are of the view that as the hierarchy used in the pres-
ent study consists of numerous categories, it would render it
unfeasible to do a construct validity at all levels. But a factor
analysis at the topmost category that has the four domains of
development could certainly be attempted.
Thus, the first phase of the study is comprised of two
components:
A. desk review to generate a tentative list of relevant in-
dicators and
Lokuketagoda et al. 3
B. qualitative study to carry out content and cultural vali-
dation of the above.
Component A: Desk Review to Generate a
Tentative List of Relevant Indicators
The purpose of the desk review was to gather the generic
list of expectations on what children should know and be
able to do at a given age during the period of 2 to 12 months
of their life and to define indicators to reflect them.
Therefore, the data items included a comprehensive list of
indicators that reflected a particular child's developmental
performance pertaining to each developmental domain
(Motor, Socio-emotional, Cognitive, and Language
domains). These indicators were finally organized into the
hierarchy. The data for the desk review were gathered after
review of several sources. These included review of text-
books on child development, existing developmental stan-
dards, and developmental scales.
Textbooks reviewed were Child Development by John W.

Subsequent to this, a review of articles on ECDS in the
form of an electronic search was done to cover the standards
and indicators already developed in the world. The articles
were the following:
1. "South Africa National Early Learning and
Development Standards for children birth to four years.
Department of Basic Education, Pretoria, SouthAfrica"
(Department of Basic Education, Pretoria, 2009).
2. "Revised Tennesse Early Learning Developmental
Standards" (Tennesse Department of Education,
2013)
3. Ohio's infant and toddler guidelines (U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, National Infant &
Toddler Child Care Initiative, Child Care Bureau,
Office of Family Assistance, Administration for
Children and Families, 2006).
4. "Washington state early learning and development
guidelines." (Washington State Department of Early
Learning, 2011)
5. "Macedonia Early Learning and Development
Standards from 0-6 years" (Damovska, Janeva,
Palcevska, Panova, & Shaehu, 2006).
Searches in Medline (1970 to present), PsycINFO (1960
to present), and Embase (1960 to present) did not yield any
additional information. The search terms used were "devel-
opment," "child," and "standards." A keyword search and a
title search were done.
Next, scales of development commonly in use were
reviewed. These were the Bayley Scales of Infant and
Toddler Development (Bayley, 2005), the Denver
Developmental Screening Tool (Frankenburg et al., 1996),
the Parents' Evaluation of Development Status (Glascoe,
1997), and the Ten Questions Screening Interview (Landers
& Kagitcibasi, 1990).
Additional items appearing in these instruments which
did not include highly specified test material and items that
were not too complex so that it would be understood by the
average caregiver were included.
Finally, a comprehensive list of items was obtained, and
they were assigned to the domain, subdomain, specific
aspect, and standard hierarchy. They were placed in the rel-
evant age groups reflecting the ages of 2 to 3 months, 3 to 6
months, 6 to 9 months, and 9 to 12 months.
The indicators chosen had the following characteristics:
·
· Reflecting only a single skill or activity
·
· Being specific for a particular skill
·
· Having the ability to capture the performance as the
skill advances
Qualitative Study to Carry Out Content and
Cultural Validation
This was to assess whether the indicators were comprehen-
sive in covering the domains, were actually reflecting the
domain under which they were included, and were actually
reflecting the specific aspects and standards given. Modified
Delphi technique was used for this process. For this, six
experts comprising of three local consultant pediatricians
(two qualified in developmental pediatrics), two psycholo-
gists, and a consultant child psychiatrist were utilized.
They were requested to go through each indicator with
regard to the following and give their verdict:
1. Comprehensiveness of the standards and indicators
in covering all aspects of the domain.
2. Adequacy in reflecting the scope of the domain.
3. Reflection of the standard, specific aspect, subdo-
main, and domain under which they were included.
4. Representation of domains in comparatively equal
distribution.
5. Observability and measurability.
6. Are a reflection of what children in the age group are
expected to know and be able to do.
After the initial round, the comments were analyzed for
each item. If four or more out of six agreed on an indicator, it
was taken as valid and included in the final instrument. If
four or more experts disagreed, they were removed from the
list. If three agreed, those indicators were again presented to
all six experts. After completion of the second round, if the
disagreement still stood at 50% (three disagreeing), the item
was removed.
The finalized list of indicators at the end of this phase was
transformed into measurable items with the help of a pedia-
trician involved in development assessment of children. This
was brought about by laying out specific instructions to elicit
a skill. To maintain uniformity in testing, a testing procedure
had to be explained precisely so that the data collectors could

Lokuketagoda et al. 5
conform to the procedure. The Bayley Scales of Infant and
Toddler Development was consulted to decide on the posi-
tions, objects, and distance that items should be held when
testing was done.
Next, a focus group discussion (FGD) of parents was held
to gather information required to fine-tune the indicators to
ensure their cultural appropriateness. Four FGDs were held
on four different occasions, each consisting of eight parents.
The indicators were then pretested. Pretesting was done
using 10 children from age category. All the indicators in the
age group were administered and assessed whether any dif-
ficulty arose to their observability.
Results
Following the first component which was the desk review,
171 indicators were compiled under the framework. They
were organized under 25 standards which reflected 23 spe-
cific aspects in four main domains of development. Table 1
gives the framework of domains, subdomains, specific
aspects, and standards.
Tables 2-5 give the 171 indicators arranged in the frame-
work. Some indicators appeared in more than one age group
as the indicators which suited the best age group could be
selected once they were age validated.
Out of the 171 indicators, 46 indicators were removed at
the end of content validation. Tables 6 and 7 summarize how
these indicators were reduced during content validation.
As 46 indicators were removed at the end of content vali-
dation, 125 indicators proceeded to the next step of the study
which was the FGD with parents to ensure cultural appropri-
ateness. Although removal of 48 indicators is shown, in actu-
ality, only 46 indicators were removed as two were relocated
elsewhere. No major modifications were needed following
the FGDs.
The development framework with the 125 indicators is
given in Tables 8-11
Next, the indicators were pretested. Following pretesting,
26 indicators had to be removed due to issues in measurabil-
ity. Table 12 gives the indicators removed following
pretesting.
Discussion
Due to lack of trained personnel and funds, developing coun-
tries are not in a position to hold a regular development
screening program. Recognizing this fact, several countries
have developed ECDS. The ECDS developed in this study
was used as a pilot to develop national standards for child
development in Sri Lanka. The first objective of the study
was to define a set of tentative indicators to reflect the devel-
opment in the four domains of development. This took the
form of a desk review that generated a tentative list of indica-
tors. The indicators were placed in the development frame-
work described in the methodology. The main issue faced by
the researchers was that most literature on child development
gives indicators only under the four main domains. Fitting
these indicators into the framework was a complicated task.
The dearth of measurable indicators in the social and cogni-
tive domains was another issue.
During content validation, the domain in which the most
number of indicators was removed was the socio-emotional
domain. Twenty-four were removed as they were not observ-
able, and three were removed as they were too advanced for the
given age groups in which the indicator would be tested. The
reason for this is that social and emotional skills depict an
unquantifiable aspect of a person and therefore are more quali-
tative than quantitative. Development scales like the Bayley
Scales of Infant and Toddler Development therefore do not
include socio-emotional skills in their scoring component
(Bayley, 2005). Indicators for social development skills taken
from Western literature tend to cause issues when used in a
non-Western setup. In a preliminary survey done for the
Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool, it was found that a
significant amount of social indicators taken from Western lit-
erature had to be discarded as they did not qualify following a
logistic regression analysis to obtain population norms
(Gladstone et al., 2010).
TheCognitivedomainhadaltogether14indicatorsremoved.
Eight of these indicators were initially placed under the two
standards: (a) comparison and sorting and (b) spatial awareness
which were in the subdomain Logical Thinking and
Mathematics in the Cognitive domain. The issue arose as to
whether these standards were applicable in infancy.Although it
is said that mathematical skills operate even in early infancy,
there is a problem in including it in an instrument for two rea-
sons. First, it cannot be accurately said that functions like com-
parison and sorting operate in very early life.Although research
has found that even newborns have rudimentary mathematical
knowledge (Cook & Cook, 2009), there is not enough evidence
to include these skills in a document such as this.
In the Language domain, four indicators were removed as
they overlapped with other indicators in measuring the
standard.
In the Motor domain, only one indicator was removed as
it was not objectively measurable. This domain shows indi-
cators that are less complicated and have fewer aspects than
other domains. This could be the reason that indicators
belonging to this domain form the bulk in assessment sys-
tems of child development in the first half of the 20th century
(Gessel & Amatruda, 1947). Improvements in psychometrics
in the latter half of the century have made it possible to mea-
sure less straightforward aspects in development like socio-
emotional components.
Conclusion
The development indicators in the framework could be used
as a tool to screen children for development delays after
undergoing a reference-based validation. The second part of
