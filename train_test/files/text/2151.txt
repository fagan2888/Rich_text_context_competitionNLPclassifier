This meta-analysis integrates results from 229 studies on gender differences in caregiver psychological and
physical health, caregiving stressors, and social resources. Contrary to common perceptions, gender differences in
caregiving variables were small to very small. Women had higher levels of burden and depression, and lower
levels of subjective well-being and physical health. They reported that their care recipient had more behavioral
problems; they provided more caregiving hours, helped with more caregiving tasks, and assisted with more
personal care. Women and men did not differ in the use of informal and formal support. Statistically controlling
for gender differences in stressors and resources reduced the size of gender differences in depression and physical
health to levels that have been observed in noncaregiving samples. The results support stress-and-coping theories
on gender differences in caregiving.
CAREGIVING has been identified as a chronic stressor
that places caregivers at risk for physical and emotional
problems (Aneshensel, Pearlin, Mullan, Zarit, & Whitlach,
1995). According to the National Caregiver Survey, the major-
ity of caregivers (71.5%) are daughters and wives (Stone,
Cafferata, & Sangl, 1987).
Several theories have suggested that gender differences
in caregivers' outcomes exist because, compared with male
caregivers, female caregivers face higher levels of caregiving
stressors, have fewer social resources, and report lower levels
of psychological and physical health. These suggestions have
been made, for example, in the gender-role socialization frame-
work (Gilligan, 1982), the gender-role expectation framework
(Barusch & Spaid, 1989), and in theories of labor marked
segregation and household labor (Ross, 1987). However, only
a portion of the available studies have found empirical support
for gender differences in caregiver variables (for qualitative
review, see Yee & Schulz, 2000). In contrast, it has been sug-
gested that observed gender differences in caregiver health
merely reflect gender differences in general well-being rather
than caregiving-specific factors (e.g., Vitaliano, Zhang, &
Scanlan, 2003).
Available qualitative reviews have not addressed several
crucial questions, including whether gender differences in
stressors, social resources, and health that were observed in
individual studies are statistically significant when averaged
across a large number of studies. Furthermore, these reviews
did not assess how large the observed gender differences are,
and in particular, whether they are of practical significance. For
example, in the case of large sample sizes, even the smallest
gender differences may be statistically significant but have no
practical meaning. Although available results were heteroge-
neous, sources of between-study heterogeneity could not be
tested by these reviews. Finally, because it has been suggested
that gender differences in caregiver health may not be based on
caregiving-specific factors, it remains unclear whether the size
of gender differences in caregiver health would be larger than
the size of gender differences observed in samples not selected
for caregiving, and whether gender differences in caregiver
health would be explained by related differences in stressors
and resources.
Meta-analysis is ideally suited for answering these questions,
but two existing meta-analyses on gender differences in
caregiving variables were based on a low number of studies:
one (Miller & Cafasso, 1992) used 14 studies, and another
(Vitaliano et al., 2003) used only 4. Therefore, the meta-
analyses could not address these questions. The present meta-
analysis is based on more than 200 studies and provides reliable
answers to these questions.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS
The Statistical and Practical Significance of Gender
Differences in Caregiver Stressors, Social Resources,
Psychological Health, and Physical Health
Several interrelated theoretical explanations for observed
gender differences in caregivers' stressors, resources, and
health have been put forward in recent reviews (Yee & Schulz,
2000; Lutzky & Knight, 1994; Miller & Cafasso, 1992;
Vitaliano et al., 2003).
First, the gender-role socialization framework (Gilligan,
1982), the gender-role expectation framework (Barusch &
Spaid, 1989), and theories of labor marked segregation and
household labor (Barusch & Spaid; Ross, 1987) suggest that
women provide more care (in hours as well as duration) than
do men. These theoretical frameworks also suggest that women
may be confronted with higher levels of care recipient (CR)
impairments, as reflected in the need for help with activities
of daily living (ADLs), because they are less likely to
institutionalize their ill relative. Empirical results, however,
are inconsistent. For example, the narrative review by Yee and
Schulz (2000) summarizes four studies in which women spend
more time providing care than men, but two studies in which

2006, Vol. 61B, No. 1, P33­P45
P33
there was no significant gender difference and one study in
which men provided more care.
Second, with regard to social resources, Stoller (1990) has
proposed that male caregivers are more likely than female
caregivers to seek social support because they are less
comfortable with the caregiving role. However, gender differ-
ences in social support may be smaller than expected because
women have larger social networks and more available sources
of informal support (Antonucci, 1990). Thus, male caregivers
may be more motivated to use informal support than are female
caregivers, but they may have less access to it. Again, available
results are inconsistent: In their narrative review of caregiver
studies, Yee and Schulz (2000) found that men use more
informal support in four out of six studies and more formal
support in three out of five studies than women.
Third, based on stress-and-coping models of caregiving (e.g.,
Pearlin, Mullan, Semple, & Skaff, 1990), more stressors and
fewer social resources for female caregivers are suggested to
result in lower levels of psychological and physical health in
female than in male caregivers. However, empirical results are,
again, heterogeneous. For example, Yee and Schulz (2000)
identified seven studies in which female caregivers were more
depressed than male caregivers and two in which there were no
differences. With regard to subjective well-being (SWB), three
studies showed gender differences, but other cited studies did
not replicate this finding. Physical health was poorer for female
than for male caregivers in a recent meta-analysis of four
studies (Vitaliano et al., 2003), but other studies did not find the
same result.
A main reason for the observed inconsistency between
studies may be that gender differences in caregiving variables
are often small and, therefore, only detected in studies with
large sample sizes. Because a meta-analysis pools results across
studies, small gender differences can be reliably identified.
Thus, on the basis of the gender-role expectations framework,
gender-role socialization framework, theories of household
labor, and stress-and-coping theories, we expect with regard to
the first research question that, compared with men, women
would (a) provide more care, (b) spend more hours providing
care, and care for individuals with greater (c) physical, (d)
cognitive, and (e) behavioral symptoms. Women would (f)
report lower levels of social support, and they would show
lower levels of (g) psychological and (h) physical health.
Inadditionto statistical significance, we evaluated thepractical
significance of results. Although there are no generally accepted
criteria of practical significance, Cohen (1992) and Rosenthal
(1991) suggest that a variable should explain at least 1% of
variance of the dependent variable, and at least 55% of women or
men, respectively, should be in the group with above-median
levels of the dependent variable. With regard to our second
research question, we use Cohen's criteria and the binomial effect
size display (BESD; Rosenthal) for evaluating which gender
differences in caregiving variables are practically significant.
Sources of Between-Study Heterogeneity
As the studies varied considerably in whether they found
gender differences in caregiving variables (Yee & Schulz,
2000), our third research question focuses on sources of
between-study heterogeneity. We analyzed two groups of
moderator variables, namely the study quality and the sample
characteristics that are theoretically linked to the size of gender
differences.
Study quality. --Common criteria for high-quality studies are
the use of a probability sample, the use of theoretically sound
measures, and the publication in a peer-reviewed journal
(Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). More reliable results are found in
studies using probability samples than convenience samples
and in studies using well-established, validated measures.
Because convenience samples and studies with ``homemade''
measures may overestimate or underestimate the size of gender
differences, we stated no specific expectation on the effect of
these variables on the size of gender differences. As non-
significant results are less likely to be published (the file-drawer
problem; see Rosenthal, 1991), we expected larger gender
differences to appear in peer-reviewed articles than in other
papers. Because file-drawer problems are more common for
variables that are the central focus of the study, we expected
larger gender differences in articles with a main focus on
gender differences.
Percentage of spouses. --We expected that gender differ-
ences in caregiving would be smaller in spouses than in adult
children because distributing caregiving responsibilities be-
tween daughters and sons can be based on gender-role and
related expectations, whereas spouses have less choice to select
gender-specific caregiving tasks (e.g., Stoller, 1992).
Cohort and age differences. --There is some evidence that
gender roles have become more flexible over time (e.g.,
Gerson, 2002; Miller, 1996). Thus, we expected that gender
differences in caregiving variables would be smaller in more
recent studies and in younger individuals who have received
a less traditional gender-typed socialization.
Are Gender Differences in Caregiver Health
Specific to the Caregiving Experience?
In our final research question we asked whether larger gender
differences in psychological and physical health would be
found in caregiver studies than in population-based studies not
specific to caregiving, and whether elevated gender differences
in caregiver health could be explained by gender differences in
caregiving stressors and social resources.
Because there are gender differences in depression, SWB,
and physical health in the general adult population, Vitaliano
and colleagues (2003) have suggested that gender differences in
caregiver health may reflect factors not specific to caregiving.
In fact, a meta-analysis on depression among adults, who were
not identified as caregivers, found higher levels of depression
in women than in men (Davis, Matthews, & Twamley, 1999).
Similarly, another meta-analysis on samples not specific to
caregiving found that women had significantly lower levels of
SWB and of perceived physical health than did men (Pinquart
& So
¨rensen, 2001). However, these gender differences were
very small.
Stress-and-coping models of caregiving suggest that gender
differences in caregiver health can be explained by gender
differences in caregiver stressors and resources (e.g., Lutzky &
Knight, 1994;Pearlin et al., 1990).Thus, we expectedwith regard
to our fourth research question that gender differences in

caregivers' mental and physical health would exceed those found
in the general population, and that statistically controlling for
gender differences in caregivers stressors and support use would
reduce the size of gender differences in caregiver health.
METHODS
Sample
We identified studies from the literature through electronic
databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE; search terms caregiving or
caregivers or carer and elderly or old age) and cross-
referencing. Criteria for inclusion of studies in the present
meta-analysis were as follows:
1. The studies were written in English.
2. Informal caregivers of older adults (60þ years) were
assessed.
3. Standardized gender differences in caregiving variables
could be computed.
We had to eliminate approximately 20% of the total number
of studies surveyed, mainly because insufficient information
about the magnitude of relationship between variables had been
reported. After exclusion of such studies, we were able to
include 229 studies in the meta-analysis. The articles were from
The Gerontologist (29 articles), Psychology and Aging (13), the
International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry (10), the Journals
of Gerontology (8), the International Journal of Aging and
Human Development (7), Research on Aging (7), and other
journals (125). In addition, we included 23 unpublished studies
and 7 book chapters. Studies used in the meta-analysis are listed
in the Reference section. The individual studies included in the
analyses and the studies with probability samples are marked
with superscript symbols and letters.
We entered the number of female and male caregivers, the
type of illness of the CR, the sampling procedure (1 ¼
probability samples, 0 ¼ convenience samples), year of data
collection, publication status (1 ¼ peer-reviewed journal, 0 ¼
other), the measurement of the variables, the quality of the
measures (1 ¼ widely used and theoretically sound measures,
0 ¼ other), the standardized size of gender differences in the
variables studied, and correlations of the study variables. If no
exact information on the year of data collection was provided
in the paper, we estimated a delay of 3 years between year of
data collection and year of publication, based on the studies
that had provided this information. If gender differences were
provided for several subgroups in the same publication (e.g.,
for children and spouses), we entered these separately into
our analysis instead of entering the global association mea-
sures. If papers reported results from one data set but for
different variables, we omitted duplicate results.
Measures
We found that caregiver burden was most often assessed
with the Caregiver Burden Interview (Zarit, Reever, & Bach-
Peterson, 1980; 42 studies) and other related scales (93 studies),
and depression was most often assessed with the Center for
Epidemiologic Studies­Depression scale (Radloff, 1977; 40
studies), and other measures (38 studies). SWB was measured
with life-satisfaction scales (13 studies) and other scales
(11 studies). Caregiver health was assessed with single-item
indicators of perceived health (34 studies) and symptom
checklists (12 studies).
We found that the CR's physical limitations were measured
with indicators of ADLs and instrumental ADLs (IADLs; 34
studies). Cognitive deficits were assessed with the Mini-Mental
State Examination (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975; 15
studies) and similar scales (13 studies). Behavior problems
were measured with the revised Memory and Behavior Problem
Scale (Teri et al., 1992; 13 studies) and other scales (19
studies). The number of hours of care provision, the number of
caregiving tasks, and the number of months in the caregiving
role were assessed with single items.
Informal support was most often assessed by the use of help
from the informal network (29 studies) and by the availability
of network members as potential support source (21 studies).
Formal support use was assessed by the frequency of receipt of
support from sources other than family, friends, and neighbors
(24 studies).
Statistical Integration of the Findings
1. We used random-effects models (Hedges & Vevea, 1998).
We computed effect sizes, d, for each study. For example,
d ¼ 1.00 for burden would indicate a relatively stronger
burden in women than in men by 1 SD. We recoded outliers
that were more than 2 SD from the mean of the effect sizes
to the value at 2 SD (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001).
2. We tested the homogeneity of effect sizes by using the
homogeneity statistics, Q.
3. We computed the weighted mean effect sizes, as suggested
by Hedges and Vevea (1998).
4. We tested the significance of the mean by dividing the
weighted mean effect size by the estimated standard
deviation. Then we computed confidence intervals that
include 95% of the effects for each effect size. We
interpreted differences between two conditions as significant
when the 95% intervals did not overlap.
5. As a tool for interpreting the practical significance of the
results, we used the BESD (Rosenthal, 1991). For example,
if the same number of men and women is assessed and
caregivers with above-average and below-average burden
are split at the median, then the percentage of women with
above-average burden is computed by 0.5 þ r/2, and the
percentage of above-average burden in men is 0.5 ­ r/2; r is
computed by transforming mean effect size d.
6. To test the simultaneous effect of more than one vari-
able, we computed a weighted multiple linear regression
analysis.
RESULTS
Sample Description
The studies we included were published or presented
between 1983 and June 2005. Sixty-four studies compared
caregiving wives and husbands, 29 studies compared daughters
and sons, and 136 studies combined spouses, adult children,
and other informal caregivers. About 46% of the studies
focused on dementia caregiving; 15% of the studies focused on
caregiving for physically frail older adults; and 39% of the
GENDER DIFFERENCES IN CAREGIVING P35
studies included both dementia caregivers and other caregivers.
About 22% of the studies used probability samples. The
number of participants of the studies ranged between 17 and
5,627 (M ¼ 283, Mdn ¼ 116). About 29% of the studies had an
explicit focus on gender differences (as indicated by their title).
The caregivers had a mean age of 59.5 years (SD ¼ 8.0
years). About 69% were women. We included data from 18,831
wives, 9,283 husbands, 19,131 daughters, and 8,236 sons in the
meta-analysis. The CRs were, on average, 75.8 years old (SD ¼
5.2), and approximately 60% of them were women.
Gender Differences in Caregiver Health,
Stressors, and Resources
In support of our first expectation, caregiving women
reported higher levels of CRs' behavior problems, more hours
of care provision, more caregiving tasks, higher levels of
caregiver burden and depression, and lower levels of physical
health and subjective well-being than did caregiving men
(Table 1). Interestingly, when analyzing specific caregiving
tasks, we found that significant gender differences emerged
only for personal care. Contrary to our expectation, we found
no significant gender differences for the other stressors, formal
support use, and use and availability of informal support.
With regard to practical significance, gender explained 2.8%
of the variance of depression, 2.7% of the variance of burden,
and 1% of the variance of the number of caregiving tasks
(Table 1). According to Cohen's (1992) criteria, gender dif-
ferences in burden, depression, and number of caregiving tasks
were small (d , 0.50) and the other differences very small (d ,
0.20). As another tool for interpreting the practical significance
of gender differences, we computed BESDs. When an equal
number of men and women are assessed, 58% of women are in
the group with above-average levels of burden and depression,
as compared with 42% of men. In addition, 55% of women help
with an above-average number of caregiving tasks, as com-
pared with 45% of men. However, despite the fact that gender
differences in SWB were statistically significant, the percen-
tages differed only slightly for men and women: 52.5% of
women as compared with 47.5% of men reported below-
average SWB.
Moderator Variables
All observed gender differences were heterogeneous (Table
1). To test for variables that explain this heterogeneity, we
computed weighted multiple linear regression analyses based on
random effects models (Table 2). Positive regression coeffi-
cients indicate that higher levels of the independent variables are
associated with larger levels of the outcome variable in women
and lower levels of the outcome variable in men.
With regard to study quality, we found that women reported
less depression in studies using well-established, theoretically
sound measures. In addition, women reported lower levels of
depression and SWB, and more hours of care provision than men
in convenience samples as compared with probability samples.
Three effects of publication status appeared: In peer-reviewed
articles, women reported more cognitive deficits in their CR,
more hours of care, and less use of informal support than men
compared with articles that were not peer reviewed. In studies
with an explicit gender focus, women showed lower levels of
SWB than men, and they provided care for a longer time.
In samples with a lower percentage of spouses, women were
more likely to report cognitive deficits and behavior problems.
Finally, gender differences varied by caregiver age and year of
publication. In older samples, women reported lower levels of

formal support, higher levels of behavior problems, and less
SWB than men. In addition, women reported more CR
cognitive deficits in older than in more recent studies. Thus,
stronger gender differences emerged in older samples and in
older studies.
Are Gender Differences in Caregiver
Health Caregiving Specific?
With regard to our fourth research question, we had expected
that gender differences in depression, SWB, and physical health
would be larger in caregiver studies than in population-based
studies. Because no population-based studies were available
that compared the size of gender differences in caregivers
versus noncaregivers, we compared the results of our meta-
analysis with those of previous meta-analyses with samples not
selected for caregiving. In support of our expectation, gender
differences in depression were larger for caregivers (d ¼ 0.34,
95% confidence interval or CI ¼ 0.29 to 0.40) in our meta-
analysis than they were in the meta-analysis by Davis and
colleagues (1999; d ¼ 0.25, CI ¼ 0.21 to 0.29). Similarly,
gender differences in caregiver physical health (d ¼À0.17, CI ¼
À0.23 to À0.12) exceeded those among adults in general that
have been reported in a previous meta-analysis (d¼À0.08, CI¼
À0.09 to À0.07; Pinquart & So
¨rensen, 2001). However, the size
of gender differences in the SWB of caregivers (d¼À0.09, CI¼
À0.17 to À0.01) did not differ significantly from the size of
gender differences in adults in general (e.g., life satisfaction:
d ¼À.08, CI ¼À0.09 to À0.06; Pinquart & So
¨rensen).

GENDER DIFFERENCES IN CAREGIVING P37
Thus, gender differences in caregiver health were larger than
those observed in general populations for two out of three
outcome variables. To investigate potential reasons for this
difference, we tested whether gender differences in psycholog-
ical and physical health of caregivers would be reduced after we
controlled for gender differences in caregiver stressors and
social support. We computed a correlation matrix of these
variables, based on the meta-analytic approach of Rosenthal
(1991). We ran separate hierarchical regression analyses with
burden, depression, SWB, and physical health as the dependent
variables, and gender (Step 1), stressors (Step 2), and social
resources (Step 3) as the independent variables. In the first steps
of the analysis, gender explained 1.7% of the variance of
burden, 2.9% of the variance of depression, 0.4% of the
variance of SWB, and 0.3% of the variance of physical health
(Table 3). After we included stressors, the variance explained
by gender dropped to 0.9%, 2.2%, 0.2%, and 0.2%, re-
spectively. Nonetheless, the effect of gender remained
statistically significant. Controlling for social support variables
further reduced the amount of variance in caregiver burden
explained by gender. Still, gender differences for all caregiving
outcomes remained significant. However, after converting the
effect sizes of gender from the third step of the regression
analysis back to the metrics of standard deviation units (Lipsey
& Wilson, 2001), we found that the remaining gender
differences in caregiver depression (d ¼ 0.29, CI ¼ 0.26 to
0.32) no longer differed from those observed in population-
based samples (d ¼ 0.25, CI ¼ 0.21 to 0.29; Pinquart &
So
¨rensen, 2001). Similarly, after controlling for caregiver
stressors and social resources, we found that the remaining
gender differences in physical health (d ¼ À0.08, CI ¼ À0.11
to À0.05) are similar to those in population-based samples
(d ¼À0.06; CI ¼À0.09 to À0.07).
DISCUSSION
The present meta-analysis expands our understanding of both
the extent of and reasons for gender differences by including
a broader range of indicators of caregiver stressors, social
resources, and caregiver health in the analysis than is found
in prior reports. We found that most gender differences in
stressors, social resources, and health were very small. When
applying Cohen's (1992) criteria, we found that only gender
differences in burden, depression, and the number of caregiving
tasks were of practical importance. We then identified study
characteristics that moderate the observed effect size. Finally,
we showed that gender differences in caregiver depression and
physical health were larger than those observed in the general
adult population, and, in part, they were explained by gender
differences in caregiver stressors.
Gender Differences in Caregiving Variables
Consistent with previous meta-analyses (Miller & Cafasso,
1992; Vitaliano et al., 2003), the present study supports the
finding that gender differences in psychological health, physical
health, and caregiving stressors are present, but that they are
small or very small in magnitude. On the basis of 229 studies,
we found that statistically reliable gender differences appeared:
Compared with male caregivers, female caregivers reported
higher levels of behavior problems, more hours of care
provided, higher number of caregiving tasks, more caregiver
burden and depression, and lower SWB and physical health.
According to Cohen's (1992) criteria, only gender differences
in burden, depression, and amount of care were of practical
significance. Gender differences in the provision of personal
care were at the threshold of being practically significant. Our
results suggest that there are more similarities than differences
between female and male caregivers, and that most caregiving
stressors, such as the number of caregiving hours, are probably
more strongly determined by actual needs of the CR and the
availability of additional helpers than by gender differences in
socialization, identity, or caregiving motives, as has been
previously suggested.
Contrary to theoretical suggestions (e.g., Stoller, 1990),
female and male caregivers did not differ in the use of informal
and formal support. Women's more extensive formal support
system (Okun & Keith, 1998) may have counterbalanced the
effects of male caregivers' greater tendency to seek support. In
addition, gender differences in formal support use may vary
by the source of support (e.g., self-help group vs home care
services), thus reducing the chance of finding significant gender
differences (e.g., Barusch & Spaid, 1989). Unfortunately, we
did not find enough studies addressing the effects of different
forms of formal support to test for gender differences.
Impact of Study Characteristics
On average, study characteristics explained 26% of the
between-study heterogeneity of effect sizes. Less variance was
explained in analyses with larger numbers of studies, because
they include more study-specific sources of variance. Because
only sample means rather than the distribution of the variables
were available for analysis for age and percentage of spouses,
the amount of explained variance by these variables is reduced.
Study quality was related to gender differences in three
instances. Gender differences were larger in probability
samples. Because convenience samples are often biased toward
highly distressed caregivers and show restricted variance
(Pinquart & So
¨rensen, 2003), gender differences were probably
smaller in these studies. We also found some evidence for file-
drawer problems: In studies with an explicit gender focus and
in peer-reviewed articles, there were stronger (and more
significant) gender differences, which confirmed common
theoretical frameworks on gender differences.
We found smaller gender differences in cognitive deficits
and behavior problems for samples with high a percentage
of spouses, probably reflecting the fact that spouses have
less choice to select caregiving tasks and to avoid caregiv-
ing stressors. However, no other kinship effects appeared.
Stronger effects of spousal status may appear when comparing
gender differences in homogeneous samples of spouses versus
adult children.
On the basis of changing gender roles (e.g., Gerson, 2002),
we had expected smaller gender differences in more recently
published studies and in younger age groups (i.e., in more
recent cohorts). Our expectation was supported for 4 out of 24
comparisons. Effects of the year of data collection may even
have been underestimated in our study, as no exact informa-
tion on that variable was available in many studies. Nonethe-
less, we conclude that caregiving experiences of men and
women have become more similar in recent cohorts. However,

because gender roles are slow to change (Cafferata, Horn, &
Wells, 1997), only a few cohort effects were detected.
Gender Differences: Caregiving-Specific Versus
Caregiving-Unspecific
It has been suggested that gender differences in caregiver
health may merely reflect gender differences in population health
(e.g., Vitaliano et al., 2003). Because previous reviews could not
test this hypothesis, the present study makes an important
contribution in stating rather unequivocally that gender differ-
ences in depression and physical health of caregivers are indeed
larger than those found in general populations.
Our meta-analysis supports the explanation of gender
differences in caregiver health by the stress-and-coping
framework (e.g., Lutzky & Knight, 1994), in that statistically
controlling for the level of stressors reduces gender differences
in psychological and physical health. Because the gender
differences in depression and physical health that remain after
stress intensity and social support are controlled for are not
larger than those reported by people in the general population,
we conclude that higher levels of caregiving stressors and, in
part, lower levels of social resources among female (vs male)
caregivers account for the elevated gender differences in these
measures. This has implications for the design of interventions,
because gender differences in caregiver health can be reduced
by reducing women's levels of stressors. The remaining gender
differences may be based on differences in resources and
stressors that are not specific to caregiving (Pinquart &
So
¨rensen, 2001; Sinnott & Shifren, 2001), and on women's
greater readiness to disclose negative feelings and health
problems (Verbrugge, 1985).
Limitations and Conclusions
The present paper has several limitations. First, because
many bivariate effect sizes were heterogeneous, the multi-
variate analyses must be interpreted with caution. Second, too
few studies were available for some variables to be included
in the present meta-analysis, such as caregiving­work con-
flicts. Third, the size of gender differences in caregiving
variables may also be influenced by other sample charac-
teristics, such as gender of the CR (Be
´dard et al., 2005).
Unfortunately, we did not find enough studies to meta-
analyze the interplay of gender of caregivers and CR. Finally,
searching for moderators for 12 variables increased the
likelihood that we would make a Type I error. We dealt with
this source of error by focusing our discussion on moderators
that were significant in more than one analysis.
Despite these limitations, five conclusions can be drawn from
our study. First, because gender differences in burden, de-
pression, amount of care provision, and quality of the relation-
ship with the CR were of practical significance according to
Cohen's criteria, interventions tailored at negative caregiver
outcomes should include these aspects. For example, inter-
ventions may focus on actual and previous relational stressors
and on getting help with ADL assistance. Gender differences
are usually smaller than would be expected from gender-role
theories.
Second, we conclude that caregiving increases gender
differences in depression and physical health, primarily because
women experience more caregiving stressors. Third, the
magnitude of gender differences is somewhat overestimated
in peer-reviewed studies and in studies with explicit gender
focus. This suggests that results that do not confirm common
stereotypes about strong gender differences are more difficult to
get published. Fourth, on the basis of the effects of caregiver age
and year of data collection on the size of gender differences, we
conclude that gender differences in caregiver variables are
subject to social change, because--at least for some variables--
smaller differences appear in more recent studies and for
younger caregivers. Finally, our results suggest that husbands'
and wives' experience of caregiving is fairly similar, whereas
sons' and daughters' experience may be somewhat different, but
not as much as one might expect. Though sons are less likely
than daughters to take over the caregiver role than husbands
compared with wives (Stone et al., 1987), once they have
become caregivers, they both report similar behaviors and
feelings as do wives and daughters.
With regard to future research, we need, first, more differ-
entiated research questions. For example, rather than asking for
gender differences in formal support use in general, we must ask
which sources of support are more likely to be used by female
and male caregivers. Second, more research is needed that
directly tests theories on gender differences in caregiving
stressors (e.g., socialization experiences and time availability).
Third, more research is also suggested regarding whether
caregiving stressors and resources affect women differently than
they do men. For example, it is possible that tensions in the
relationship with the CR may cause more stress for women than
for men. Finally, because there is some evidence that the size
of gender differences in caregiving variables may change over
time (Schulz & Williamson, 1991), more longitudinal work is
needed as well.
