Abstract
Objective: To investigate the optimal dose of dexmedetomidine for attenuating the haemo-
dynamic response during emergence from anaesthesia.
Methods: Patients undergoing laparoscopic total hysterectomy were randomly allocated to
receive 0.9% normal saline (control group) or dexmedetomidine (0.5 mg/kg, 0.75 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg
30 min) before extubation. Heart rate, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure and extubation time
were measured before drug administration, immediately after the end of drug administration,
10 min after the end of drug administration, immediately after extubation and 5 min after
extubation.
Results: A total of 120 patients were included in the study (30 per group). Systolic and diastolic
arterial pressure and heart rate after drug administration were significantly lower in all three
dexmedetomidine groups compared with controls. Extubation times in the 0.75 and 1.0 mg/kg
dexmedetomidine groups were significantly longer than in the control group.
Conclusion: Intravenous infusion of 0.5 mg/kg dexmedetomidine 30 min before the end of surgery
attenuated the haemodynamic responses during emergence without prolonging the extubation
time. Dexmedetomidine doses higher than 0.5 mg/kg did not exert additional positive effects on
cardiovascular responses, but did significantly prolong the extubation time.

Introduction
Emergence from anaesthesia and tracheal
extubation are commonly associated with
haemodynamic and plasma catecholamine
responses due to postoperative pain, tra-
cheal irritation and the use of anticholiner-
gic drugs.1,2 When these responses are
excessive, they may result in adverse effects
such as increased intracranial and intraocu-
lar pressure, myocardial ischaemia and
arrhythmias.3,4 Many studies have investi-
gated strategies to attenuate hyperdynamic
responses, including extubation under deep
anaesthesia and the use of calcium-channel
blockers, b-blockers or short-acting opi-
oids.5­7 However, although extubation
during the deep planes of anaesthesia
avoids cardiovascular stimulation, it can
also depress the respiratory and circulatory
systems and occasionally results in difficulty
managing the upper airway;5 drug treat-
ments have not been fully successful.6,7
Dexmedetomidine is a highly specific
a2-agonist with sedative, analgesic and sym-
patholytic effects without significant respira-
tory depression.8­10 When dexmedetomidine
was administered before and during general
anaesthesia, its sympatholytic effect was
manifested by decreases in arterial blood
pressure, heart rate and noradrenaline
release during emergence from anaesthesia
and extubation.11,12 Research has focused
on the haemodynamic and sedative effects of
dexmedetomidine during emergence from
anaesthesia,11­14 but to date the optimal
dose of dexmedetomidine for stable haemo-
dynamics during emergence has not been
studied. The present study aimed to deter-
mine the optimal dose of dexmedetomidine
for attenuating the haemodynamic response
during emergence from anaesthesia.
Patients and methods
Patients
Female patients aged 18­60 years, with
American Society of Anesthesiologists
(ASA) status I or II, scheduled for total
laparoscopic hysterectomy between August
2012 and January 2013 at St Vincent
Hospital, Catholic University of Korea,
Suwon, South Korea, were enrolled.
Patients with asthma, hypertension, dys-
rhythmia, morbid obesity (body mass
index > 25 kg/m2) and those who required
transfusion during surgery were excluded
from the study.
Patients were randomly allocated in
equal numbers to one of four groups:
control group S (saline), group D0.5
(0.5 mg/kg dexmedetomidine), group
D0.75 (0.75 mg/kg dexmedetomidine) or
group D1.0 (1.0 mg/kg dexmedetomidine).
The group allocation and names were
coded and remained concealed until com-
pletion of the statistical analyses. Rando-
mization was performed using a block
randomization technique with opaque
sealed envelopes, performed by an anaes-
thesiologist who was not involved in the
anaesthetic management of the patients or
data collection. Random numbers were
grouped in blocks in an allocation ratio
of 1:1 for the four study groups. Study
drugs were prepared by nurses who were
not involved in the study; all of the drugs
were diluted in a total volume of 50 ml
normal saline.
All patients provided written informed
consent. The study protocol was approved
by the institutional review board of
St Vincent Hospital (VC12MISION124)
and listed on a World Health Organization-
recognized registry (KCT0000822).
Anaesthesia induction and maintenance
In the operating room, routine monitoring
was performed, including blood pressure
measurement, electrocardiography, pulse
oximetry and capnography. Anaesthesia
was induced with 2­2.5 mg/kg propofol
and 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium. After endotra-
cheal intubation, anaesthesia was
1140 Journal of International Medical Research 42(5)
maintained with 6­8 volume% desflurane
and 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen.
Mechanical ventilation was adjusted to
maintain the end-tidal carbon dioxide par-
tial pressure at 30­35 mmHg. During sur-
gery, 6 ml/kg per h Ringer's lactate was
infused; if blood loss occurred, the equiva-
lent volume of 6% hydroxyethyl starch was
also infused.
In all patients, intraoperative opioids
were not administered and local anaesthetic
was not infiltrated into the laparoscopic
incision site.
Arterial blood pressure and heart rate
were maintained between 80% and 120% of
the preoperative values by increasing or
decreasing the concentration of desflurane
during surgery. Severe hypertension (defined
as systolic arterial pressure [SAP]
> 180 mmHg) or tachycardia (defined as
heart rate > 100 beats/min lasting > 3 min)
during the extubation period that could not
be controlled by increasing the concentra-
tion of desflurane were treated with intra-
venous 20 mg/kg nicardipine or 0.5 mg/kg
esmolol, respectively. After administration
of the study drug, hypotension (defined as
SAP < 80 mmHg) was treated with a 10-mg
intravenous bolus of ephedrine; bradycardia
(defined as heart rate < 50 beats/min) was
treated with a 0.5-mg intravenous bolus
of atropine.
Emergence from anaesthesia
Approximately 30 min before the antici-
pated completion of surgery, an anaesthesi-
ologist blind to the drug and group
allocation administered the study drug
intravenously over 10 min. In addition,
0.5 mg/kg ketorolac tromethamine was
given intravenously 10 min before the antici-
pated end of surgery; 5 min before the
anticipated end of surgery the desflurane
concentration was decreased to 5 volume%.
Desflurane was discontinued at the end of
surgery and the lungs were ventilated with
100% oxygen. Residual neuromuscular
blockade was reversed with 6 mg/kg glyco-
pyrrolate and 0.15 mg/kg pyridostigmine in
all patients. Extubation was performed once
the patient was breathing spontaneously.
Heart rate (HR), SAP and diastolic arter-
ial pressure (DAP) values were recorded
before study drug administration, immedi-
ately after the end of drug administration,
10 min after the end of drug administration,
immediately after extubation and 5 min after
extubation. The extubation time was defined
as the time between discontinuation of
inhalation agents and extubation.
Statistical analyses
The number of patients required in each
group was determined using a power calcu-
lation based on data from our preliminary
study of dexmedetomidine and its influence
on the haemodynamic responses (unpub-
lished). This calculation established that 30
patients were required in each group for a
type I error of 0.05, a type II error of 0.2,
Á ¼ 18 and SD ¼ 20 for the SAP parameter.
Recruitment was increased by 10% to com-
pensate for unexpected loss.
The within-group data for SAP, DAP
and HR were analysed using repeated-
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA);
between-group differences were analysed
using the Student's t-test. Comparisons
among groups were made using covariance
analysis followed by Bonferroni post-hoc
testing. Extubation times were compared
between groups using one-way ANOVA
followed by Dunnett T3 post-hoc testing.
A P-value < 0.05 was considered to be stat-
istically significant. All statistical analyses
were performed using SPSSÕ software, ver-
sion 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
A total of 132 patients were randomized into
the study. Of these, 12 were excluded due to
Seo et al. 1141
transfusion or change to open abdominal
hysterectomy. Of the remaining patients, 30
patients were allocated to each intervention
group and received the allocated treatment
(Figure 1). Baseline patient characteristics
and the duration of surgery and anaesthesia
were similar in the four groups (Table 1).
Hypertension requiring treatment with
nicardipine was observed in three patients
in group S during extubation, but not in any
of the dexmedetomidine groups. Tachycar-
dia requiring treatment with esmolol
occurred during extubation in significantly
more patients in group S than in
the dexmedetomidine groups (P < 0.05,
Table 1). The number of patients who
received ephedrine for hypotension after
administration of the study drug did not
differ significantly among the four groups.
However, significantly more patients in the
D0.75 and D1.0 groups required atropine to
treat bradycardia after administration of the
study drug compared with group S
(P < 0.05, Table 1).
The SAP was significantly lower in all
three dexmedetomidine groups compared
with group S at all times from 10 min after
the end of drug administration (P < 0.001,
Figure 2). In addition, the SAP in groups
D0.5 and D0.75 was significantly lower than
in group S immediately after the end of drug
administration (P < 0.001, Figure 2).
The DAP was significantly lower in all
three dexmedetomidine groups compared
with group S 10 min after the end of drug
administration (P < 0.05, Figure 3). In add-
ition, the DAP was significantly lower in
group D0.5 immediately after the end of

drug administration and in group D1.0
immediately after extubation and 5 min
after extubation, compared with group S
(P < 0.05, Figure 3).
The HR results were similar to those for
SAP. The HR was significantly lower in all
dexmedetomidine groups compared with
group S at all times after drug administration
(P < 0.05), except for group D0.5 5 min after
extubation (Figure 4). Among the dexmede-
tomidine groups, HR was significantly lower
in group D1.0 than in group D0.5 5 min
after extubation (P < 0.05, Figure 4).
Extubation times in the four groups are
shown in Figure 5. The time taken for
extubation was significantly longer in
groups D0.75 and D1.0 compared with
group S (P < 0.05).
Discussion
The present study demonstrated that
prophylactic use of dexmedetomidine
0.5 mg/kg was effective for attenuating
cardiovascular responses during emergence
without prolonging extubation time.
Substantial haemodynamic stimulation
during tracheal extubation may adversely
affect patients.2 Changes in ejection fraction
and cardiac work during recovery can
induce undesirable complications, such as
myocardial ischaemia, in vulnerable individ-
uals.15,16 Stabilization of blood pressure and
heart rate throughout emergence and the
recovery period is especially important in
patients with coronary artery disease.17
Anaesthesiologists need to be able to per-
form a smooth extubation with stable
haemodynamics.
Dexmedetomidine, like other a2-adrener-
gic agonists, exerts sympatholytic effects by
activating inhibitory a2 receptors in both the
central nervous system and the peripheral
sympathetic nerve endings, inhibiting nor-
adrenaline release.18 The inhibition of sym-
pathetic transmitter release can be measured
in humans as a decline in the plasma
concentration of noradrenaline.19 The pre-
vention of a catecholamine reaction to

stress by dexmedetomidine may be of clin-
ical importance, since there is a clear rela-
tionship between surgical events known to
produce intense sympathetic stimulation
and perioperative myocardial infarction.16
Dexmedetomidine causes brief biphasic,
dose-dependent cardiovascular effects via
the stimulation of a2 receptors.20 At high
doses or doses that are quickly administered,
dexmedetomidine stimulates the a2 recep-
tors in vascular smooth muscle, and causes a
transient increase in blood pressure and a
reflex drop in heart rate.10 The initial tran-
sient increase in blood pressure, presumably
mediated by peripheral vasoconstriction, is
followed by a longer lasting reduction in
blood pressure, presumably due to both
centrally and peripherally mediated sym-
patholytic actions.4 A reduction in circulat-
ing catecholamine is consistent with the
long-lasting reduction in sympathetic tone
caused by this compound.

detomidine was given as a 2-min intravenous

infusion in healthy volunteers, lower doses
(0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) resulted in a monopha-
sic reduction in mean arterial blood pres-
sure, whereas larger doses (1.0 and
2.0 mg/kg) resulted in biphasic responses.
With larger doses, the maximal early tran-
sient pressor effect was associated with a
doubling of the systemic vascular resistance
and a reduction in cardiac output. The
second, biphasic pressure effect involved a
longer lasting reduction in mean arterial
blood pressure, with concomitant decreases
in HR and cardiac output.21 Dexmedetomi-
dine also reduced plasma noradrenaline
levels for >4 h at all four doses.21 In the
present study, dexmedetomidine was infused
over 10 min, and no biphasic blood pressure
responses were seen, even with a dose of
1.0 mg/kg. This suggests that the transient
pressor phase can be avoided by using a

slower infusion rate, which is important for
patients with impaired cardiac function.
In the present study, the effects of
0.5 mg/kg dexmedetomidine on haemo-
dynamic responses during extubation were
not significantly different from those of 0.75
or 1.0 mg/kg dexmedetomidine. However,
0.5 mg/kg dexmedetomidine did not prolong
extubation time compared with the control
group, while doses of 0.75 or 1.0 mg/kg
dexmedetomidine did delay extubation by
increasing amounts, suggesting that pro-
longation of the extubation time was dose
dependent. Although the extubation time in
the 0.5 mg/kg dexmedetomidine group was
longer than that in the control group, the
difference was not statistically significant.
These findings are comparable with those of
previous studies. Guler et al.14 reported that

attenuated airway and circulatory reflexes
during extubation, but there was no signifi-
cant difference in extubation time between
the dexmedetomidine and control groups. In
addition, Bicer et al.22 reported that patients
who received 1.0 mg/kg dexmedetomidine
demonstrated a prolonged extubation time
compared with a control group after sur-
gery. In the present study, although extuba-
tion times were prolonged in group D0.75
and D1.0 compared with group S, these
doses may deserve consideration for provid-
ing haemodynamic stability throughout
emergence and recovery in particular cir-
cumstances (such as in patients with myo-
cardial ischaemia).
The present study has a number of
limitations. First, because 0.5 mg/kg dexme-
detomidine was the lowest dose tested, it is
not possible to state that this is the min-
imum required dose. Bloor et al.21 reported
that infusions of 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg dexme-
detomidine decreased mean arterial blood
pressure by 14% and 16%, respectively, in
healthy volunteers. Therefore, a dexmede-
tomidine dose <0.5 mg/kg may be sufficient
to attenuate cardiovascular responses
during anaesthesia emergence. Secondly,
the occurrence of coughing or other
airway reflexes was not investigated. The
presence of the endotracheal tube leads to
reflex responses, the most common of
which is coughing, which can cause hyper-
tension and tachycardia. Dexmedetomidine
has been reported to facilitate tolerance of
the endotracheal tube and to significantly
reduce coughing during extubation.14
Thirdly, the sample population consisted
of only young adult female patients who
were relatively healthy. It needs to be
determined whether the present findings
can be generalized to male patients, and
other age groups.
In conclusion, intravenous infusion of
0.5 mg/kg dexmedetomidine 30 min before
the end of surgery attenuated haemo-
dynamic responses during emergence, with-
out prolonging the extubation time, in
patients undergoing total laparoscopic hys-
terectomy. Dexmedetomidine doses higher
than 0.5 mg/kg did not exert additional
positive effects on the cardiovascular
responses, but did significantly prolong the
extubation time.
