Introduction
Violence is a major global public health problem (WHO;
2014; Krug, Mercy, Dahlberg, & Zwi, 2002). This is a par-
ticularly important issue for adolescents and young adults
who are most often the primary perpetrators and victims of
interpersonal violence (WHO, 2002, 2014). However, data
are scarce on issues pertaining to the scope and factors con-
tributing to interpersonal violence, particularly in low- and
middle-income regions such as Africa and South America
(Brown et al., 2009; Krug et al., 2002; WHO, 2014).
Unfortunately, limited existing data suggest that these areas
of the world are those in which youth homicide rates are the
highest (Reza, Mercy, & Krug, 2001; WHO, 2002, 2014).
Violence among children and adolescents living in the
slums of sub-Saharan Africa is of particular concern because
of their dire circumstances and unmet health needs (Blum,
2007). Previous research, although limited in scope, indi-
cates relatively high levels of interpersonal violence among
youth in Kampala (Swahn, Gressard, Palmier, et al., 2012).
This may not be surprising given that economic hardship,
family conflict or disruption, abuse, and maltreatment are
often predisposing situational factors that result in living on
the streets, in the slums, or in other compromised living situ-
ations (Ali & De Muynck, 2005; Densley & Joss, 2000;
Jacob Jacob, Smith, Hite, & Cheng2004; LeRoux & Smith,
1998; Mufune, 2000, Tyler., Gervais, & Davidson, 2012).
Clearly, street children are exposed to high levels of poverty,
family conflict, and low parental attachment, as well as alco-
hol and drug use, which have been well established risk fac-
tors for interpersonal violence and further victimization
(Sethi, 2010; WHO, 2002, 2014).
Although reproductive health broadly defined has been
prioritized to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexu-
ally transmitted infections, the role of sexual violence vic-
timization is rarely addressed in this context among
vulnerable youth. Girls and young adult women living in
compromised living situations seem particularly exposed to
victimization, not only sexually but also physically. As such,
there is a need to empirically quantify these experiences and
to determine potential modifiable risk factors that may be
addressed. Hence, this study seeks to determine the level of
victimization, both sexually and physically, and to determine
the range of victimizations overall that these girls and young

Abstract
This study determined the prevalence and correlates of victimization among girls and young women in Kampala. The study
population, a convenience sample of youth living in the slums, were 14 to 24 years of age, and participants in community-
based drop-in centers (N = 313). Overall, the prevalence of physical fights (37%), being threatened or injured with a weapon
(28%), and being raped (30%) was high and increased with age. Multivariate analyses revealed that sadness, drunkenness, and
hunger were associated with multiple forms of victimization. Findings suggest that additional services are needed to address
the cumulative impact of victimizations, depression, and living conditions.

women have experienced. Moreover, it is recognized that it
is important to determine the correlates for multiple victim-
izations. In addition, fatalism, the concept of not making
necessary investments in one's well-being, such as being
cynical about difficult life circumstances, is particularly per-
vasive in poor communities worldwide (Bernard, Dercon, &
Taffesse, 2011; Dalton, Ghosal, & Mani, 2014; Dercon &
Singh, 2013; Whelan, 1996). Therefore, there is a need to
determine how sexual victimization, in particular, in the
form of rape victimization shapes the future investments and
orientation of these girls and young adult women.
The purpose of this study is to address four overarching
research questions:
Research Question 1: What is the prevalence of violence
experiences among girls and young women and does the
prevalence vary by age?
Research Question 2: What is the prevalence of experi-
encing multiple forms of violence and do the psychoso-
cial correlates associated vary by the types of
experiences?
Research Question 3: Because sexual victimization
(rape) is often described as one of the most serious forms
of victimizations, what are the psychosocial correlates
associated with rape?
Research Question 4: Finally, is sexual victimization
associated with a positive or negative future outlook?
Our approach is to quantitatively answer these questions
among girls and young women in a convenience sample of
service-seeking youth who live in the slums of Kampala, the
capital city of Uganda while also addressing commonly indi-
cated psychosocial and confounding factors that may place
these youth at increased risk of violence (Hugheset al., 2014;
WHO, 2002, 2014).
The results of this study may be used to provide guidance
on the development of prevention strategies to address the
violence experiences this disparate population faces as well
as service provision of those who have already been victims
of violence.
Method
The overarching goal of the cross-sectional survey called the
"Kampala Youth Survey," conducted in May and June of 2011,
was to examine the exposure of alcohol marketing and its asso-
ciations with problem drinking and drunkenness in a conve-
nience sample of urban youth living in the slums, 14 to 24 years
of age. The methodology and findings from this study have
been reported previously (Swahn, Braunstein, & Kasirye,
2014; Swahn, Braunstein, Palmier, Kasirye, & Yao, 2014;
Swahn, Haberlen, Palmier, & Kasirye, 2014; Swahn, Palmier,
& Kasirye, 2013; Swahn, Palmier, Kasirye, & Babihuga, 2014;
Swahn, Palmier, Kasirye, & Yao, 2012; Swahn, Gressard,
Palmier, et al., 2012). The youth participants were receiving
services in Uganda Youth Development Link (UYDEL)
drop-in centers for disadvantaged street youth (UYDEL,
2014). UYDEL at that time, served on average about 650
youth per month through these drop-in centers. Face-to-face
surveys, lasting about 30 min, were administered by social
workers/peer educators employed by UYDEL. The study
was implemented across eight drop-in centers across
Kampala. Participating youth received snacks and transpor-
tation for completing the survey. No identifying information
was collected, and the surveys were completely anonymous.
Surveys were administered in English or Luganda, to the
extent possible, in private settings and rooms, to ensure pri-
vacy of survey questions and responses. Each social worker/
peer educator received training on the study methodology,
and each of the survey questions and its translation into
Luganda (local language) if needed, and recruited potential
participants among attendants at their specific drop-in center.
Recruitment took place using word-of-mouth, and each
attendant was eligible for participation if he or she was
between 14 and 24 years of age. No exclusion criteria were
applied beyond the age range. Participants were informed
about the study and read (or were read) the consent forms to
indicate their willingness to take the survey. The consent pro-
cess required that emancipated street youth 14 to 17 years of
age provide their own consent for participating in the survey
because youth 14 to 17 years of age who "cater for their own
livelihood" are considered emancipated in Uganda, thereby
waiving parental permission. The same consenting process
was followed for youth 18 to 24 years of age.
Overthe10-daysurveyperiod,507youthwereapproached
for participating in the survey. Among these youth, 46
declined, and 461 agreed to participate, yielding a participa-
tion rate of 90.9%. Four of the surveys were missing substan-
tial numbers of responses and were therefore excluded,
yielding 457 completed surveys for the final analytic sample
of youth between the ages of 14 and 24 (31.1% boys and
68.5% girls). The mode for age was 17 years (n = 81), and
67% of the participants were between ages 16 and 20. These
analyses, based on girls and young women, included 313
participants.
Measures
The survey questionnaire was modeled from existing sur-
veys, including the U.S.-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey
conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC,2012) and the international Global School­Based
Student Health Survey supported by the WHO (WHO, 2015).
Survey questions addressed demographic characteristics,
family context, alcohol and drug use, injuries, violence and
suicidal behaviors, sexual behaviors, and sexually transmit-
ted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. The study protocol was
approved by the Georgia State University Institutional
Review Board and also by the Uganda National Council for
Science and Technology. Funding to conduct the study were
Swahn et al. 3
obtained from the Georgia State University Office of
International Initiatives and also from funds leveraged
through collaboration with the Emory Center for Injury
Control, funded by the CDC.
The measures included in the analyses and their preva-
lence among study participants are described in Table 1.
Demographic and psychosocial characteristics assessed
included age; living circumstances (whether parents were
alive); whether the youth had apprenticeship skills; whether
they were taking care of themselves at night; whether they
reported hunger, drunkenness, sadness, loneliness, or
expected to die early; and whether they had made a suicide
attempt. In terms of the violence variables, the survey asked
whether they had (a) witnessed family violence, (b) reported
parental abuse, (c) been involved in physical fights, (d)
threatened or injured with a weapon, and (e) been raped.
These five variables were dichotomized to indicate the pres-
ence of any or none of each form of violence and then com-
bined into a summative scale, ranging from 0 to 5 to indicate
exposures to multiple forms of violence. The cell sizes for
the prevalence of exposure to multiple forms of violence
were relatively low, and as such, the outcome measure was
recoded to reflect three levels of violence: zero, one to two
forms of violence, and three to five forms of violence.
Finally, future outlook was assessed using 6 measures asking
if in the past month they had thought about the following:,
whether they felt hopeful about the future, whether they felt
they would never have enough money, whether they expected
to die prior to age 30, that bad things would happen, whether
they thought they would be unhappy and whether or not they
expected to have a nice family when they were older. Four of
the six measures were from the "Positive Outlook-Individual
Protective Factors Index" developed by Phillips and Springer,
1992 (and psychometric properties reported by Gabriel,
1994), as presented in a compendium of assessment tools
(Dahlberg, Toal, Swahn, & Behrens, 2005). Response options
were "never," "sometimes," and "often." Measures were
dichotomized to indicate presence of outlook factor if
respondents reported "often."
Analyses
Three sets of analyses are presented in the article. The first
descriptive chi-square analyses present the prevalence of
violence exposure and test for significant differences for
those less than 18 years of age versus those 18 years and
older (Table 2). The second analyses present bivariate and
multivariate logistic regression analyses to determine the
psychosocial correlates associated with rape (coded raped
vs. not raped; Table 3). The multivariate analyses included
all those variables in the model that were significant in the
bivariate analyses (e.g., age, hunger, drunkenness, sadness,
loneliness, and expecting to die early). Finally, the third
descriptive chi-square analyses present the prevalence for
each of the six outlook questions by rape victimization
(Figure 1). Both SAS 9.2 and SUDAAN 10 statistical

frequently reported by young women age 18 and above than
among girls younger than age 18.
In terms of experiencing multiple forms of violence,
53.6% of the participants reported experiencing one to two
forms of violence, and 29.6% reported experiencing three to
five forms of violence. Bivariate associations between demo-
graphic and psychosocial correlates, and multiple violence
experiences are presented in Table 3. Self-monitoring at
night, hunger, drunkenness, and expecting to die early were
associated with reporting three to five forms of violence. In
multivariate analyses, hunger and sadness were statistically
associated with reporting three to five forms of violence.
In bivariate analyses of the factors associated with rape
specifically (Table 4), self-monitoring at night, hunger, and
drunkenness were statistically associated with rape. In multi-
variate analyses, hunger and drunkenness remained statisti-
cally significantly associated with rape.
Finally, intests of associations between rape and future
outlook, four of the six measures were statistically signifi-
cant. Girls and young women who were raped were more
likely to expect not to have enough money, to die early, to be
unhappy, and to have bad things happen to them.
Discussion
In this study of girls and young women living in the slums of
Kampala, the findings show that there are substantial reports
of experiencing multiple forms of violence, which remains
an issue that is not typically addressed. Violence was also
reported more frequently among young women than among
the girls suggesting that potential strategies for violence pre-
vention should be implemented earlier in life. We also found
that violence was common and that hunger and drunkenness
emerged as important factors associated with reporting mul-
tiple forms of violence and specifically also with rape.
Although the context for these violent experiences were not
assessed, it is clear that the circumstances of these youth liv-
ing in the slums may present a range of situations involving
conflict and altercation with respect to obtaining resources,
such as money, food, and shelter.These youth also report
many adverse childhood experiences with high levels of vio-
lence within the homes. Moreover, a substantial number are
orphans with one or two deceased parents. Thus, the family
context of these youth is grim and further exacerbated by
reports of food insufficiency and limited care, nurturing, or
supervision, which increases risk of further victimization.
Among the girls and young women in our study, drunken-
ness was a significant correlate of reporting multiple forms
of violence as well as of rape specifically. These findings are
similar to previous research conducted in the United States
that underscores the link between a range of alcohol mea-
sures and involvement in violence, as a perpetrator or victim,
and also within gang cultures and marginalized youth
(Brewer & Swahn, 2005; Swahn, Bossarte, West & Topalli,
2010). Swahn, Simon, Hammig, & Guerrero, 2004). Alcohol
use is an important concern, particularly among vulnerable
youth in Kampala, because estimates indicate that Uganda
has one of the highest per capita alcohol consumption in the
world (WHO, 2004). However, studies of alcohol use spe-
cifically in violent behaviors in this population or region
remain scarce.
Given the dire context of these youth and in particular of
the many girls and young adult women who reported having
been raped, it would be expected that their outlook for the
future would be affected. Extant research suggests that
socially disadvantaged youth have lower levels of collective
cognitive and social resources on which to encourage them
to have high aspirations or expectations for the future
(Clinkinbeard & Zohra, 2012; Foster & Spencer, 2011).
Oftentimes, economic independence as a goal increases the
desirable futures of young people (Foster & Spencer, 2011).
In our study, the girls and women who reported being raped
differed from those who were not on four of the six measures
assessed. Girls and young women who were raped were
more likely to expect to not have enough money, to expect to
die early, to be unhappy, and to have bad things happen to
them. However, they did not differ with respect to being
hopeful about the future or having a nice family. With respect
to the measures that were significantly different, expecting to
be unhappy in the future is troubling and signals the need for
interventions to ameliorate the impact of social disadvantage
on their lives, such as multi-level interventions that seek to
raise young women's self-esteem, improving their sense of
safety, and economic security and social mobility.
Some limitations restrict the interpretation of the findings
of this study. First, the study utilized a broad definition of
youth living in the slums, including both homeless youth

living on the streets and youth reporting a variety of living
arrangements. Second, because the participants in this study
were recruited from UYDEL drop-in centers, the study sam-
ple is not a random selection of youth in the slums of
Kampala. Although it is unclear how the sample selection
affects the results, we speculate that the findings observed in
the present study are an underestimate of the true burden of
violence and disadvantage in this community. Third, the sur-
vey instrument used in this study had not been previously
piloted among Ugandan youth. However, the majority of the
survey items were adopted from previously validated sur-
veys, including the U.S. Youth Risk Behavior Survey and the
Global School­Based Health Survey. Fourth, the low liter-
acy level of many of the study participants required that the
survey was read aloud to the participants. The direct face-to-
face interaction between the interviewer and the participant
may have resulted in underreporting of certain risk behaviors
and experiences because of social desirability. A fifth limita-
tion is that several study participants provided their responses
to survey items in their local language of Luganda, thus
requiring the interviewers to translate the answers into
English. Sixth, some of the statistical analyses included rela-
tively small sample sizes and yielded relatively wide confi-
dence intervals indicating that findings may be less stable.
Last, our findings are limited by the cross-sectional nature of
this study. A temporal relationship between the psychosocial
variables and violence experiences cannot be determined,
nor can causation be inferred.
Despite these important limitations, the findings from this
study describe the prevalence and correlates of relatively severe
forms of violence including rape among these vulnerable girls
and young women. Hunger, drunkenness, and sadness were
the most important factors associated with multiple violence
experiences. In addition, hunger and drunkenness were also
specifically associated with rape. More troubling perhaps is
that being victimized by rape also shapes the future outlook
with respect to expecting future unhappiness, death, and bad
things compared with those not raped. Because of the scar-
city of data related to violence experiences, and in particular
sexual victimization among girls and young women in sub-
Saharan Africa, additional research is needed to validate
these findings. Future research should also assess the extent
to which trading sex for necessary food and shelter is a key
concern among vulnerable girls and women, not only in sub-
Saharan Africa (Ntozi, Mulindwa, Ahimbisibwe, Ayiga, &
Odwee, 2003) but also elsewhere (Potdar & Mmari, 2010)
and its potential role in increasing risk for violent victimiza-
tion. Efforts should also be made to determine modifiable
factors that can be incorporated into prevention programs
that may reduce, at least partially, the consequences of the
adverse childhood experiences and violence victimizations
experienced by these girls and young women.
