A preliminary study of active compared with passive imputation of
missing body mass index values among non-Hispanic white youths1­4

ABSTRACT
Background: Addressing missing data on body weight, height, or
both is a challenge many researchers face. In calculating the body
mass index (BMI) of study participants, researchers need to impute
the missing data.
Objective: A multiple imputation through a chained equations ap-
proach was used to determine whether one should first impute the
missing anthropometric data and then calculate BMI or use an
imputation model to obtain BMI.
Design: The present study used computer simulation to address the
question of how to calculate BMI when there is missing data on
weight and height. The simulated data reflected data gathered on
non-Hispanic white youths (n ¼ 905) aged 2­18 y, who participated
in the 1999­2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES).
Results: The simulation indicated that it made little difference in
the accuracy with which the youths' mean BMIs were estimated
when the data were missing completely at random. However, the
use of a model to impute BMI was favored slightly when the data
were missing at random and the imputation model included the
variable used to determine missingness.
Conclusion: The present findings extend the use of passive imputa-
tion and the use of multiple imputation through a chained equations
approach to an area of critical public health importance. Am J

INTRODUCTION
Overweight and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in
many countries (1­4). Of the measures used to assess an in-
dividual's body fat, the most prominent is body mass index
(BMI), which is calculated as weight (in kg)/height2 (in m) (1, 5,
6). The latter cannot be calculated when either measurement is
missing, and failure to address the missing measurements may
bias the estimation. To minimize bias, many researchers have
used multiple imputation (7, 8).
Multiple imputation has been widely used since Rubin pro-
posed his framework (9­13). Many researchers have modified
these methods; therefore, frequent reviews have become nec-
essary (14­19). Rubin's framework identifies 3 missing data
mechanisms (13). When data are missing completely at random
(MCAR), the probability of nonresponse cannot be predicted by
any variable, observed or unobserved, and participants with in-
complete data constitute a random sample of all participants.
When data are missing at random (MAR), the probability of
nonresponse depends on observed and missing variables. Finally,
when data are missing not at random, the probability of non-
response depends on observed variables.
To date, the literature on multiple imputation has not addressed
a number of basic questions (20). One such question is, ``Should
researchers impute the components needed to calculate an index
or should they impute the index?'' Two exceptions include
studies conducted by Liu et al (21) and Gmel (22). Liu et al had
missing data on one or more 12-item Short Form Health Survey
(SF-12) items and wanted to calculate the 2 SF-12 component
scores. They used computer simulation to compare the perfor-
mance of a ``simple'' imputation model that used the available
SF-12 item scores with that of an ``enhanced'' model that sup-
plemented the available scores with other participant data. The
enhanced model performed better when !6 SF-12 items were
missing; the simple model was adequate when the number of
missing items was ,6. Because Gmel's respondents had missing
data on !1 of 8 components, Gmel could not calculate a sum-
mary measure of alcohol consumption. Gmel imputed item
scores because the distribution displayed by his items was most
consistent in his multivariate normal imputation model.
If data were missing on a few items, most researchers imputed
the missing component scores. This practice would be consistent
with that of Liu et al (21). When 2 variables (eg, weight and
height) are used to calculate an index such as BMI, will it matter
whether the researcher imputes the missing data or simply im-
putes the index? The present study used computer simulation to
address this question using simulated data consistent with that

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The National Center of Health Statistics, a unit of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, periodically collects na-
tionally representative data on the health and nutrition status of
the US population by using the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) (23). Trained personnel in-
terview family members and collect data on the participants'
sociodemographic characteristics, diet, and health. A proxy is
interviewed if the individual is aged 15 y or cannot provide
a report. Participating individuals are invited to visit a mobile
center for standardized medical examinations that include an-
thropometric measurements. The present study is based on data
obtained from 905 non-Hispanic white youths between the
ages of 2 and 18 y when they participated in the 1999­2000
NHANES.
Measures
Age (y) was assessed by asking the individual or the proxy for
the sampled person's exact date of birth. Standing height (cm)
was measured to the nearest tenth of a centimeter with a fixed
stadiometer with a vertical backboard and a moveable headboard.
Abdominal waist circumference (cm) was measured to the nearest
tenth of a centimeter with a steel measuring tape according to
standard procedures. Weight (kg) was measured as the individual
stood on a digital according to standard procedures. Two scales
were used if the individual weighed .440 lb (198 kg). The
individual's weight was set equal to missing if the individual had
undergone a limb amputation.
Poverty-income ratio (PIR) is the ratio of self-reported total
household income to the number of adults and children in the
family. PIR values ,1.00 are below the official poverty threshold;
PIR values .5 were set equal to 5. BMI (in kg/m2) is a relative
measure of body fat that is calculated by dividing weight by
height squared. For children and adolescents, classification as
normal/healthy weight, overweight, or obese is based on sex-
and age-specific BMI-for-age growth charts prepared by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Procedures
The present study mirrored the steps that Ezzati-Rice et al (24)
used to compare different imputation techniques with NHANES
1999­2000 data. However, it differed from Ezzati-Rice et al by
restricting attention to 6 variables: age, height, weight, PIR,
waist circumference, and BMI. Summary statistics for these
variables and the percentage of missing data on weight and
height are shown in Table 1. All computations were done using
Stata software (version 9), a general purpose statistical package
(25).Toinitiatethe simulation, Stata's hotdeckprogramwasused to
identify plausible target values for the 6 means and the corre-
sponding variance-covariance matrix. These summary statistics
were used by Stata's drawnorm program to generate multivariate
normal samples. The latter were generated because of the wide-
spread availability of multivariate normal generators. Once target
values were identified, the following 4 steps were executed:
Step 1: Draw a multivariate normal sample of 1080 observations
from the hypothetical population, delete all cases for which
generated values are 0, randomly sort the remaining records
and delete all records in excess of n ¼ 905, and proceed to
step 2 if n ¼ 905.
Step 2: Impose the missing height-weight data pattern that was
observed among the 905 NHANES participants by using an
MCAR (MAR) missing data mechanism.
Step 3: Use Stata's ICE program to obtain 10 multiply imputed
data sets (26­28). This imputation method, which is described
later in greater detail, uses a sequence of regression models to
impute missing values conditional on other predictors.
Step 4: Use Stata's MIM program (29) to apply Rubin's rules (13)
and obtain the mean, SE, and df for the combined estimates of
height, weight, and BMI, and then write the 9 values to an
output file for further analyses.
Steps1­4wererepeated5000timeswithanMCARmissingdata
mechanism and with an MAR missing data mechanism. To im-
plement an MCAR missing data mechanism, 905 records were
generated,randomlysorted,andmergedwithafilethatconsistedof
two 0/1 variables. If the value was 1, the corresponding value
of weight or height was set equal to missing; if either weight or
height was set equal to missing, the corresponding BMI value was
set equal to missing. To implement an MAR missing data mech-
anism, the 905 rows of the 0/1 indicators were shifted in the sec-
ondary file until the probability of missing height was predicted by
age, which was fully observed. (In the 1999­2000 NHANES, age
was observed for all 905 participating non-Hispanic white youths.)

To impute BMI passively, the following 2 prediction equa-
tions were used to actively impute values for height and weight:
Weight ¼ b0 1 b1 age 1 b2 height
1 b3 waist 1 b4 PIR 1 residual ð1Þ
Height ¼ b0 1 b1 weight 1 b2 age 1 b3 waist 1 residual ð2Þ
Then, after having obtained imputed values for weight and
height, an equation preceded with the keyword passive was used
to define the relation between BMI, weight, and height:
BMI ¼ weight=½ðheight=100Þ3ðheight=100Þ ð3Þ
To actively impute BMI, the following prediction equation was
used:
BMI ¼ b0 1 b1 age 1 b2 waist 1 b3 PIR 1 residual ð4Þ
Passive imputation refers to methods that were built into the
multiple imputation through a chained equations (MICE) ap-
proach by van Buuren and Oudshoorn (30) to ensure that
transformed variables (BMI in the present study) are always in
sync with the variables (weight and height) that are used to
define them. Active imputation refers to the usual methods and
models used to impute data with this approach.
MICE combines the most attractive features of multivariate
normal imputation and the more flexible regression-based
approaches to imputation. The Stata program that implements
this approach is called ICE (26­28). With this approach, the user
specifies a conditional distribution for the missing data on each
variable. For example, using Equations 1 and 2, linear regression
models were specified for weight and for height. Stata's ICE
program cycles through the system of equations until all varia-
bles have complete data. (Cycles handle incomplete data on any
specified predictor, and users can use a dry run option to see the
models that are fitted.) The critical assumption on which this
approach is built is that a multivariate distribution exists from
which the specified or implied conditional distributions can be
derived and that one can use iterative Gibbs sampling to draw ran-
dom values from these conditional distributions. Both Raghunathan
et al's (31) sequential regression approach and a multiple imputation
through a chained equations approach cycle through a sequence of
regression models to obtain imputed values. In comparative
studies of various imputation approaches, the MICE approach has
performed well (32, 33).
RESULTS
Summary statistics for the sample of non-Hispanic white
youths (n ¼ 905) who participated in the 1999­2000 NHANES
are shown in Table 1. According to the US growth chart, 69.4%
of the youths were of normal weight, 15.3% were overweight,
7.5% were obese, and 7.9% could not be classified because of
missing weight and/or height measurements.
The results from the 3 test runs are summarized in the first
3 rows of Table 2. The latter were used to verify the performance
of the multivariate normal data generator and the code used to
impose the missing data mechanisms and create the incomplete
samples. No data were imputed. Each test run consisted of 10
trials. For each trial, 5000 samples (n ¼ 1080) were generated.
Because negative values of age, PIR, weight, height, and waist
circumference are not plausible, any records with negative val-
ues that were generated at step 1 were dropped before pro-
ceeding to step 2. Test 1 was used to estimate the maximum
number of records with one or more negative values that would
be generated during a trial (and, hence, the number of records
that had to be generated for each sample to ensure that each
sample consisted of 905 records with plausible values). Across
the 10 trials of test 1, the average number of records with
negative values ranged from 43 to 110.
The 3 test runs were also used to estimate target values for
mean BMI when no missing data mechanism was imposed, when
an MCAR missing data mechanism was imposed, and when an
MAR missing data mechanism was imposed. The absolute and
relative errors for the various runs are shown in the upper portion
of Table 3. Given the target value of 20.53, the absolute error
was calculated as 100 3 ð^
h À hÞ%, and the relative error was
calculated as 100 3 ½ð^
h À hÞ=h%. A fourth test (data not
shown) was conducted to verify that control had been achieved
over the relation between the BMI missing data indicator and
age under the MAR missing data mechanism. The coefficient for
the regression of the missing BMI indicator on the values of age
generated under the MAR missing data mechanism only varied
by 0.01% over 10 trials.
To assess the extent to which the MCAR findings were de-
pendent on the use of Stata's multivariate normal random number
generator and the subsequent exclusion of negative values, 2
additional test runs were conducted (data not shown). Each run
consisted of one trial for which 5000 missing data samples were

created and processed. Each run started with the same hotdeck-
completed data set (n ¼ 905), for which the mean BMI was
19.4692. On each run, the records were randomly sorted, and the
weight and/or height measurements were set equal to missing
after merging with a randomly sorted file with two 0/1 indicators
for the NHANES missing weight-height data pattern. Stata's
ICE program was used to return 10 multiply imputed data sets,
and MIM was used to process these data sets and to obtain
a combined mean and SE for the BMI scores that had been
imputed passively (actively). When BMI scores were imputed
passively (Equations 1­3), the absolute error was 0.98% and the
relative error was 0.05%; when BMI scores were imputed ac-
tively (Equation 4), the absolute error was 20.04% and the
relative error was 0.0%. These values were comparable with
those reported when the data were generated with a multivariate
normal model and records with negative values were excluded.
On completion of the test runs, the present study moved to the
simulation phase. With each of the 4 simulation runs, the total
sample size (n ¼ 905) on entry to step 2 and the missing weight-
height data patterns on exit from step 2 were identical. More-
over, the missing weight-height data patterns were the same as
the patterns observed in the NHANES sample (Table 1). Finally,
5000 samples were generated for each simulation run, a missing
data process was imposed on each sample, and 10 multiply
imputed data sets were created and analyzed.
With simulation 1, an MCAR missing data mechanism was
imposed after each sample was generated. Then, ICE used
Equations 1 and 2 to actively impute plausible values for weight
and height; ICE used Equation 3 to passively impute missing
BMI scores. With each call to ICE, 10 multiply imputed data
sets were created. After the imputed data sets were written to
disk, another Stata program, MIM (28), was used to process the
multiply imputed data sets and to obtain combined estimates and
SEs for weight, height, and BMI.
With simulation 2, an MAR missing data mechanism was
imposed. Stata's ICE program was used to actively impute
plausible values for weight and height and to passively impute
plausible values for BMI. Ten multiply imputed data sets were
created with each call to ICE, and MIM was used to obtain
combined estimates and SEs for weight, height, and BMI.
With simulation 3, an MCAR missing data mechanism was
imposed. Then, ICE used Equation 4 to actively impute BMI and
return 10 multiply imputed data sets. After the data sets were
written to disk, MIM was used to obtain combined estimates and
SEs for BMI.
With simulation 4, an MAR missing data mechanism was
imposed, and ICE was called to actively impute BMI and return
10 multiply imputed data sets. After the data sets were written to
disk, MIM was used to obtain combined estimates and SEs for
BMI. The absolute and relative errors observed for the 4 sim-
ulation runs are shown in the lower portion of Table 3.
DISCUSSION
Many data sets have missing or implausible data for weight
and height because of nonresponse, measurement error, or data
entry problems. The results of the present study indicate that
researchers can use passive or active imputation to address
missing data on height and/or weight and obtain individuals' BMI
values when the data are MCAR or MAR. Precise estimates of the
mean BMI were obtained with passive and with active imputation
when the missing data mechanism was MCAR. Less, but still
reasonably, precise estimates of BMI were obtained with passive
and with active imputation when the missing data mechanism
was MAR. However, it must be stated that the imputation model
included age--the variable used to impose the MAR missing data
process. An obvious advantage of a missing data simulation is
that researchers know and control the factors that determine
missingness. Meeting this condition is far more challenging when
researchers collect data from study participants.
Limitations
As with all simulation-based research on missing data, the
present findings are limited to the number and variable types and
to the missing data percentages and patterns that were considered.
By no means did the present study attempt to be comprehensive
or mimic any frequently occurring missing data situation. The
authors restricted their attention to anthropometric data reported
for youths participating in the 1999­2000 NHANES because they
were working with the NHANES data and they needed BMI
scores that were not observed for all youths. The authors only
considered a limited number of variables in the present study
because this limited number provided them with the means to
assess their question, ``Should one impute the missing data on
weight and/or height and then calculate BMI or should one use an
imputation model to obtain BMI?''
Conclusions
Rubin (10­14) proposed a framework for estimating pop-
ulation parameters with incomplete data. More importantly, he
and subsequent researchers developed software that can be used
to create and analyze multiply imputed data sets (34). As these
tools have matured, researchers have sought to address practical

``how-to'' questions. The present study used computer simula-
tion to ask, Should one calculate BMI from imputed values of
weight and/or height, or should one use an imputation model to
impute BMI? The answer to this particular question is important
for !3 reasons. First, BMI is associated with elevated morbidity
and mortality. Additionally, BMI is used to mark a country's
progress toward ameliorating the current epidemic of over-
weight and obesity. Second, despite the relative ease and accu-
racy with which an individual's weight and height can be
measured by a trained individual, missing BMI data are found in
well-executed studies. Third, variables such as waist circumfer-
ence can be collected by an individual who has been trained to use
a tape measure, are highly correlated with individuals' BMIs, and
can function effectively in an imputation model for BMI.
Did it matter whether BMI was imputed passively or actively?
The results of the present study show that it made very little
difference whether BMI was imputed passively or actively when
individuals' weight and/or height measurements were MCAR.
On the other hand, active imputation of BMI was favored slightly
when the data were MAR. This latter finding is undoubtedly due
in part to the fact that the imputation model for BMI included
age--the variable that had been used to impose the MAR missing
data mechanism.
The finding that multiple imputation's combined estimator was
unbiased when the missing data mechanism was MCAR and
when the missing BMI values were imputed passively or actively
is consistent with missing data theory and with the findings
reported by other researchers. Indeed, estimates obtained by ad
hoc methods, such as mean substitution, are unbiased when the
data are MCAR. Our second major finding that the combined
estimator of mean BMI was biased slightly when the missing data
mechanism was MAR and BMI was imputed passively is also
consistent with missing data theory and the point that multiple
imputation is only as good as the imputation models for weight
and height: the dropoff in precision was due to the performance of
the imputation models for weight and height. From the literature,
it was relatively easy to find an anthropometric measure--waist
circumference--that was strongly correlated with BMI and
obtained when the youth received a physical examination. Such
was not the case for individuals' weights and heights.
Implications
The present findings generalize to ratios similar to the BMI,
such as weight/height, height/Oweight, weight/height3, the waist-
hip ratio, and waist circumference-to-height. However, our
findings clearly suggest similar simple ratios (ie, ratios of the
form ua/vb) for which the researcher has collected data that can
be used to obtain plausible values. The present findings also ex-
tend the use of passive imputation to ratios. Previous examples
have included product interaction terms and linear composites.
As substantive researchers confront the challenges posed by
missing anthropometric data, additional data collection of
measures that would afford imputation of missing data should be
considered. The present study indicates that missing BMI values
can be imputed passively or actively when the missing data
mechanism is ignorable (MCAR or MAR) and when data on
a related measure (eg, waist circumference) have been collected.
