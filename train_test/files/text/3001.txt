The assessment of race, eth nicity, and  ancestry is cr itic al in public health for seve ral reas ons. Ancestry  is  associ­ ated with health status beca use it is also associated  wi th cult ural health -related behaviors such as diet, traditi o n al hea ling, the utilization of  h ealth  services, and  adherence to prescrib ed treatme nt s, and because of discriminat io n (for example ,  in  housin g,  occupatio n,  and  health  care ) a nd the diffe rential availabilit y o f fin ancial reso urc es.-1 3 Diffe rences in health character istics also exist amon g populations of diverse Eu ropean anc estries.

  T o assess the reliabi li ty of ident ifi c atio n by race, eth ­ n icity, and ancestry, we co mpared th e classifications of individu als by self (on two  oc casions),  by self and  proxy (on tw o occasions), by self and in tervie wer (on two occasions), by self and fun eral direct or ( o n  death  certif­ ic ates), and by inter view e r and fun e ral di re c tor in a sample o f th e U.S. pop ulatio n .

Methods
From  1971  to  1975, as a part of the  Natio n al Health and N utriti o n Exa minat io n Su rvey I (NHANES [), 14 ,407 adult s betwee n ages 25 and 75 ye ars drawn by probabili ty sample from th e nonin stituti o n alized c ivilian population of the United States were interviewed and  examin ed.8 During  the initial  survey  pe riod  (1971-1974),   persons fro m pov ert y areas, perso ns of o lde r ages, and women of ch ildb earin g ages were ove rsa mpled. In 1974- 1975, an addit io nal sample was dr awn (w ith out ove rsamplin g) to increa se the total sample size. From 1981 through 1984, exten sive efforts were made in the NHANES  I  Epid e­ miolo gic Follo w-up St udy (NHEFS) to reco ntact, rein ­ terview , and brie fly reexa mine the NHANES I po pul a­

FOLLOW-U r M EAS U RES
In follow- up in terv ie ws, subjec ts wer e asked the fo llo w­ ing question:  " Most  people  in  the  U nited  S tate s  have a n esto rs  who came from  other  parts of the  wo rld.  Here is a card listing some e thn ic background s. Wh ich of

S ubj ec ts we re give n a list of 31 ch oice s, in cludin g Other and Don't know.  T hey  we re  asked  to  provide  as ma ny as th re e se co ndary ethnic bac kgro u nds, if relev ant. Of  the  sr ecific  ancestry  options  given  in  the   first  inter­ v ie w, nine  we re  iden tic al in  the  follo w-u p  in te rview ( th at is, American , Chinese , French, German, Irish, Ital­ ia n , Ja panese, M exican , and Ru ssian ), and four were sim­ ilar (t ha t is , Am erican In.dian- A l.eut , Eskimo , or Ameri­ can Indian; N egro- Black ; English- English/W elsh ; and Sp anish- S pain ). T wo o pt io n s in the fir st int erv ie w (that is, Polish and Jewish ) were not asked at follow-up, and 13 optio ns a t follo w-up (for exa mple , Dutch , C zechoslova­ kian , Middle Eastern , C uban) wer e not asked in the first int e rvie w.
  We refe r to study subie c ts who initi ally ch os e specific anc estry o pt io ns th at wer e iden tically o r s imilarly avail­ ab le in  bo th  interviews  as  the  "fixed- opt io n  co h o rt." S ubjec ts not includ ed in th e cohort are coded as O the r. Although categorie s used  in  fir st  and  follo w-up  inter­ vie ws, N egro and African-Black, are similar, we  exclude fro m th e  fix ed-o ptio n  cohort  perso ns  classifie d  as  of N egro race at  first int e rvi e w because,  unlike other study s ub jects, these persons were not allo wed to specify their own an cestry. W hereas the cate go ry Mexican was in­ cluded at  both  int er view s,  oth er  H ispan ic  cate gories di ffe red; to improve the lik elih ood of co mparability, we aggregated all non-M exic an  Hispanic  ca tego ries  at  fol­ lo w-up (that is, Puerto Rican , C uban , Sp anish, and O ther Sp anish ) into one category, S panish.
  We me asured th e re li ab ilit y o f ancestral categor ies as th e proportio n of sub je c ts whose follow-up identific ation (b y sub je c ts them selves or by proxies ) was th e same as or similar to their first identific a tio n, for e xa mple , the proportio n of subjec ts wh o identified  th emselves  as En­  gli sh in the fi rst int e rvie w wh o also iden tifie d them selves (or wh o were ide nt ifie d by proxies) as English, or  rather as English/W elsh, at follow -up. We also assessed the pro­ portion o f persons wh o identified specific  ancestrie s and wh o wer e classified in co rrespond ing races by interview ­ ers (and , in the case of  deceden ts,  by  funeral  directors), for example, the proportio n of subject s wh o identified themselves as Italians who  were  iden tifi ed  as  Wh ite  by in terview e rs. We used NHA NES I sample we igh ts and design varia bles to calcu late reliability est imat es and confidence int e rvals in the  SUDAAN  software. 17  We made fi ve co mparisons (Fi g. 1).

2. Consistency of Self-Perc eived and Proxy- Reported Ancestrv
TL) assess the consistency of self-perc e ived ancestry with ancestry as perceived by proxies, we comp ared subjects' self-classification in initial interviews with their primary classificat io n by proxies in follow-up interviews. T his compari son was restrict ed to study subjects who wer e known to have died or who were disabled.
3. Correspondence of Self-Perceived and lnren iewer­ Obseried Ancestry
To assess th e correspondence of  self-perceived  ancestry with ancestry as perce ived by NHANES observers, we compared subjec ts' primary self-classifi c at ion in fol­ low-up interviews with their racial classification by in­ terviewers a t initial int er view s. We used se lf-classif ic a­ tion at follow-up ( rather  than  at  initial  int e rvi ew) because persons classified as "Negro" by interviewers at initial int erviews were not allowed to classify their own ancestry. The comparison here was between racial cat­ egories, White, Negro, and O ther , and self-design ated ancestry that included diverse European  groups  (com­ monly classified as White), Bl.a.ck and African, and other s, such as American Indian, Chinese, and Japanese (com ­ monly classified as neither White nor Negro or Bl.a.ck ).
4. Correspondence of Self-Perceiwd and Funeral Director­ Reported Ancestry
To assess the correspondence of self-perceived ancestry with race on death cert ific ates, we compared the initial self-classification of study subjec ts who died during th e follow-up period with their classification as record d by funeral directors. Death certification require s that the decedent 's race be written in; certificates provide exam­ ples, White, Black, American Indian, rather than a checklist. Because subjects classified as "Negro" by inter­ viewers were not asked their ancestry, th ese persons were excluded from this compariso n.
5. Ancestry as Classified by Interviewer and Funeral Director
To assess the correspondence of  ancestral  classification by observers in different circumstances, we compared

options were available at initial interview  and  follow­ up- th e fixed-option coho rt- 58.3 % (95 % CL =
55.6 %, 61.Qt¾_))  of the  U.S. popula tion specified  the  same or similar primary identity in both int erv iews (Table 1 ). Sarne self-classification ranged from a low of  1.2%  (95 % CL = 0.0°t'il, 2.5%) am o ng persons  initially classifying them se lve s as American and 14 .4% (95% C L = 4.5%, 24.3%) among persons ini tially classifyi ng them se lve s as American Indian, to a h igh of 100.0% (95 % C L =  80.7 %, I 00.0%) for persons initi ally classifyin g themselves as Chinese o r as Japanese (T ab le 1). Of perso n s who initially reported that they did  not  know  th e ir  ance stry,  34.7 % (95 % CL=  25.2%,  44.1%)  also  rep orted  that  the y did not know at follow-up. The mean time from initial to follow-up interviews was 9.9 years. Consistency of self­ classific at io n did not vary in any  consiste nt  pattern  by time betwe en in terviews.
  Of persons initia lly classifying them se lves as American who changed their classification, 87.4% (95 % CL = 82.9%, 91.8 % ) subsequently specified European identi­ ties, for examp le, English/Welsh or Irish; of persons ini­ tially classifyin g them selves as American Indian wh o changed their classification, 86.1% (95 % C L = 78. l %, 94.2%) subseque n tly took a spec ific European ident ity. Of all persons who in itially reported th a t th ey did not know their ances try, 89.6% (95°;() CL= 8 1.7 %, 97 .4'Xl) of those who subsequently determined an ancestr y spec­ ified a Eu ropean origin.

only one  background; 31.6% (95% CL=    30.2%, 33.0 % )
specified  two  backgrounds;  14.9%  (95%  C L  = 13.7%,

  Among persons who specified four ethnic back­ grounds in the follow-up interview, consistency between ancestry spec ified in the fir st interview and any of four ethnic backgrounds specifie d at follow-up was 84.6% (95% C L = 80.6%, 88.5%) over all. That is , 15.4% of subjects specified ance str ies at initial in te rview that dif­ fered from all four ancestr ie s specified at follow-up. Con­ sistency was lower among persons spec ifying three (81.6%; 95% CL = 78.5%, 84.7%) and two (81.2%;

(95% CL= 46.6%, 75.3%) of subjects whose primary identity at  follow-up was American Indian were identified as

95% CL = 78.2%, 84. l % ) ethnic backgrounds at follow­ up, and lowest among persons specifying only one back­ ground (79.7; 95% CL = 76.4%, 83.0%). Patterns of consistency followed consistency between ancestry and primary identity at follow-up ( that is, lowest consistency among American and American Indian, and greatest con­ sistency among European ancestries).
  In comparison with persons specifying only one back­ ground at follow-up, among subjects who specified two ethnic backgrounds in follow-up interviews, 46.7%  (95% CL = 43.6%, 49.8%) were consistent in their primary ancestral identification from first to follow-up interviews. The proportion reporting consistent primary ancestries from first to follow-up interviews decreased in subjects reporting three (36.3%; 95% CL = 31.9%,
40.6%)  and  four  (25.5%;  95%  CL  =  20.6%, 30.5%)
ethnic backgrounds at follow-up.

CONSISTENCY OF SELF-PERCEIVED AND PROXY-REPORTED ANCESTRY
Among 1,267 proxies in the NHANES cohort, 39.3%  were spouses or roommates of the deceased, 38.4% were children, 11.3% were siblings, and the remaining 11.0% were nonrelatives. Based on this sample, proxies in the United States did not know the backgrounds of 10.3% (95% CL = 7.6%, 12.9%) of adult subjects. Among proxies who specified a primary ancestry for subjects, self-classification of ancestry at initial interview was consistent with proxy reports at follow-up interviews for 55.1% (95% CL= 49.9%, 60.3%) of subjects (Table 1). Consistent classification was lowest for subjects initially classifying themselves as American (0.8%; 95% CL = 0.0%, 2.3%) and American Indian (13.6%; 95% CL = 0.0%, 28.6%), and highest for subjects initially classify­ ing themselves as Mexican (98.3%; 95% CL = 95.0%,
100.0%)   and   Italian   (94.8%;   95%   CL   =  84.9%,
100.0 %). There were too few decedents who self-iden­ tified as Chinese or Japanese at first interview to allow comparison with proxy report at follow-up.

White and 37.8% (95% CL= 23.3%, 52.3%) as Negro by the interviewer. Among persons who identified them­ selves as African or Bku:k at follow-up, 98.7% (95% CL
= 97.9%, 99.6%) were identified as Negro by the inter­ viewer. Among subjects who self-identified as European, consistency with interviewer-assessed race was greater than 91%.

CORRESPONDENCE OF SELF- PERCEIVED AND FUNERAL DIRECTOR-REPORTED ANCESTRY
Based on a sample of 1,265 NHANES subjects who were known to have died at follow-up, 95.9% (95% CL = 86.8%, 100.0%) of persons who classified themselves as American Indian in initial interviews were classified as White on the death certificate and 4.1% (95% CL = 0.0%, 13.2%) as Bku:k (and none as American Indian). Of persons who did not know how to classify themselves at initial interview, 97.0% (95% CL = 91.4%, 100.0%) were classified as White and 3.0% (95% CL = 0.0%, 8.6%) as Black on death certificates. Among other per­ sons who initially specified an ancestry, there was close correspondence with racial classifications on death cer­ tificates.

ANCESTRY AS CLASSIFIED BY INTERVIEWER AND FUNERAL DIRECTOR
Based on the NHANES sample of 1,935 decedents, classifications by interviewer and funeral director were consistent for 99.7% (95% CL = 99.3%, 100.0%) of persons identified by interviewers as White, 97.6% (95% CL = 95.0%, 100.0%) of persons identified by inter­ viewers as Negro, and 59.4% (95% CL= 20.9%, 97.9%) of persons identified by interviewers as "other."

Discussion
Our study demonstrates that ancestral identification cannot be assumed to be a fixed or singular characteristic of persons in the U.S. population. We found that clas-




sificati o n of a person's ancestry var ie s ove r time and by method of ascerta in ment, re lations hip between person classifyin g and person classifi e d, vital sta tus of sub je ct , and spec ifi c c ategory o f ancestry. Fo rty-t wl) per cent llf person s specified d iffer e nt pr imary ancestral iden tifi c a­ tions at d iffe re nt times. Fifteen per ce n t of person s d id not specify the same or a similar ancestry at follow-up among fo ur ancestral backgroun ds. Forty- five per cent of persons we re classifi e d diffe re ntly by proxies in a fol­ low-up int e rview . Inconsis tenc y in classifica tio n both by self and by proxy was greates t for persons wh o classifi e d them selves as American and American Indian, and low es t for persons who classified themselves as Chinese, Japa­ nese. In consistenc y in th e classificati o n of diverse Euro­ pean origin s was var iable.
  C o mpariso n of th e self-classificati o n o f ancestry with the classifi c ation of race by in tervie we rs in dicates h igh corresp ondence for W hites and low co rrespondence for American Indians.
  NH AN ES I and NHEFS were no t designed for th e present study, and th e questio n s asked at fir st and fol­ low-up in tervie ws we re no t iden tical. Neve rtheless, where as th e first ques tio n refe rred to "natio nal origin" and th e seco nd to "other parts of the wo rld" and "ethnic background," both also ref erred to "ancestry." The dif­ ferenc e in questio n s may particul arly h ave affecte d th e respo nse c h o ice " American," since persons born in th e Unit ed S tat es may have co nsidered themselves to be of A merican national origin , but not of A merican ethn ic­ ity. In general, howeve r, although it is possible that the questio n was interpreted differen tly  fro m  first  to  fol­ lo w-up int erv ie ws, the use of co mmon concept s as we ll as ident ic al o r simil ar categories o n both occasio ns make s d iffere nt ial in terpret ation less likely.
  The numb er and order of respon se ch oices also d if­ fered in th e two int e rview s. Identic al res ponse choice s asked at diffe rent time s have differ en t meanings  if th e cho ic es ch ange. Co mpariso n amo ng classific ati o n sys­ tems with diffe rin g alternatives may exagge rate in co n­ sisten cy. Beca use we compared classificatio n s at two differ e nt periods in time, we  were  un able to d istingui sh ch anges du e to differen ces in the questio n from chan ges due to sh ifti n g sub ject ident it y. Diffe re n c es in ques tions and res ponse alternat iv es are also foun d in succe ssive decenni al U .S. Censuses , which are, nevertheless wid ely
used to assess populatio n trends, mak e pro je c ti ons, est i­ mate  in terce nsal  populatio n s, and  evalu ate  censuses.10
  The  fin dings on the in consistency  of self-classificat io n o f ancestry in th is study are simil ar to  result s of a study in wh ich samples of persons in  U.S.  ho use h o lds we re int erviewe d at a 1-year int erva l and asked to indica te th e ancestry of household me mbers from a list of  altem a­ tives.4 From one year to th e next,  35.3%-35.7%  of  per­ sons were classified with d iffe ring anc estri es . The h ighe r rate of ov erall consisten cy th an that found in the prese n t stud y may co rrespond to the shorter time int e rval be­
tween interviews in the previous study. Problems of consistent iden tificati on have also been noted for Hi s­
panic populations 19 and for American India ns.2° C en sus
research ers co nclude: "A cent ral problem is the in abilit y

o f the ce nsus data to reflec t a clear, un ambiguous, and
ob je ctiv e defi nition of exa ctly who is a me mber of th e Hispanic populat io n."19 Inconsistenc y may be explain ed
by "fu zzy group boundaries" - amb iguity about the cri te­ ria of group me mb e rsh ip- and "sh ifti ng identit y"­
chan ges  of  a  pe rson' s  ident ity  o ver  time .19
  The fi nd in gs on th e consistenc y o f self- and inter­ viewer-classificat io n of ancestry and race in this study confirm an ea rlie r study in wh ich 100 % of self-iden tifie d Rus sians and Canadians and 99.9% of O ther Euro peans were classifie d as White by the int ervie wer ; 97.6% of self-identified Black, N egro, o r Afro-Americans were clas­ sified as Black ; 83.9% of self-identifi ed American Indian or Alaskan N ative wer e classified as White or Black, o n ly 16.1%  as  Other; and  24.6%  of  self -ident ified  Asian  o r Paci fic Islanders we re classifi e d as White, 74. l % as Other.7 Finally, th e findin gs on the consistency o f self- and death certifica te classifi ca tio n of  ancestry  and race  in this stud y are similar to  a  study  in  which the  demo­ graph ic in forma tion on a  sa mple  of  1986 U.S.  death cert ific ates was co mpared to in form atio n re ported by
ne xt of kin.6 A mo ng decedents rep orted by  n e xt  of  kin to be White , 99 .5% were iden tified as White o n dea th cert ific ates; ident ic al reporting was 99.0% for Black s, 78.9% for Asian/P aci fic Islanders, and 76 .3% for American Indians.
  Th e " meas ure ment " of ancestry is a crit ical to o l for the elimin atio n of diffe re nces in health  status  amon g racia l/eth nic populati o ns. O ur study in d ica tes that the iden tificatio n of ancestry is problemat ic, part icularly for American Indians , persons of several Eu ropean ancestrie s, and  persons  wh o  perce ive  themselves  to   be  America n. O ur stud y indi cates that, if self-percept io n of ance stry is taken as th e stand ard  for  racial/ethni c  ident ific ation , then it should be noted th at the stand ard  it self is a fluid one, for se lf-perception changes over time.
  Given mulciple ance stries, inco n sistency should be expect ed.  In  this  study,  compared  with  person s wh o spe c ifi ed only o ne eth nic background , pe rsons wh o spec­ ified two backgrounds we re 2.4 times as likely  to  be inconsi stent in their  self-classification;  persons specify­ ing  three  backgrounds  we re  2.9  times  as  likely to  be inc onsistent in their self-classific at io n ; and those wh o specifi e d four backgro und s were 3.4 t imes as lik ely to be inc onsisten t. The  mo re  heterogeneo us  one perce ives one 's ancestry to  be, the  more one's self-identification	is likely to  change  over  time.  But,  even among  persons who specified only one et h nic backgro und, 15% alter ed their self-classific atio n fro m o ne  in terview to  the next . A nothe r so urce o f diffic ult y in the assessment of an­ cestr y may be the und erlyin g co ncept s th emselve s. The validity of th e concept of "r ace" has been questioned in recent decades; and biological notion s of "r ace" may be confused with cultural and  behavioral  notio n s of "eth­ nici ty."-21 23 Effo rt s should be made to validate the cate­ gories " race " and "eth nic ity," and, if valid , to establish basic  an th ropologic  and  other  scient ifi c principles  for the collecti o n o f public health in formati on on racial and ethnic populations. Studi es employin g th ese categorie s should clearly define and operation alize th e m so th at




resear c hers and resp on dent s know what th e categories mean and so that  inform at io n  is compatihle  fro m snurce to sourc e. It may he that the  categories  of  race  and ethnicity do not fit stan dard criter ia of mutu al ex cl usiv­ ity, exhaustiveness, and reliah ilit y, and th a t "fuzzy lo gic" (in which attributes need not apply or not app ly to give n individuals, but may  partially  apply) is  mor e  appropri­ ate' \ use of fuzzy lugic, howeve r, would further  cnmpli­ cate the calculation of rates and other epidemiologic measures.
Fin ally, classifica tio n by se lf and othe rs is also co m­
plicated by social att itudes an d political res pon ses to ancestral grnups and by mu lt iple and changin g percep­ tions of soc ial identity in different segments of th e  po p­ ulati on. Alth ough we may cont inue to use system s of ancest ral classific at io n, the interpretation of  classifica­ tion will require un derstanding of the meaning  and processes of anc estral identifi cation in  dive rse  segmen ts of th e population.
