Changing The Chronic
Care System To Meet
People's Needs
People with special medical and supportive care needs often
have to navigate several disparate financing and delivery
systems to obtain the services they need.
by Gerard Anderson and James R. Knickman
ABSTRACT: Persons who are likely to be the heaviest users of medical and
supportive care services--those with chronic illnesses, disabilities, and func-
tional limitations--are often forced to navigate a system that requires them to
perform most of the coordination functions themselves and is generally not
organized around their needs. In 1996 an estimated 128 million Americans had
at least one of these three conditions, and 9.5 million had all three. This paper
examines the current programs designed to assist these persons and suggests
changes in eligibility rules, coverage policies, and educational programs to
provide a system more oriented to people's chronic care needs.
An estimated 125 million americans had one or more
chronic illnesses, fifty million had a disability, and fifteen
million had a functional limitation in 2000. Unfortunately,
the medical care system is not oriented around the needs of persons
with chronic illnesses; many persons with disabilities have difficul-
ties obtaining appropriate services; and the long-term supportive
care system does not facilitate access to some of the services that
people with functional limitations need. The challenges to obtaining
appropriate care, however, are exacerbated when a person has two
or all three of these problems. Such persons often have to navigate a
system that requires them to coordinate several disparate financing
and delivery systems themselves, making it more difficult to obtain
the full range of appropriate services.
In this paper we first estimate the number of persons who have
chronic illnesses, disabilities, and functional limitations and then
examine the number who fall into one, two, or all three categories.

We compare the utilization, costs, and outcomes of such persons
and examine some of the problems they encounter attempting to
coordinate one or more services. The paper focuses on two prob-
lems: (1) the need to better integrate eligibility and coverage stan-
dards across disparate programs; and (2) the need to change the
professional culture of clinicians.
Chronic Illnesses
Over the past 100 years the medical care system has evolved to
become oriented primarily toward the treatment of acute illnesses.
But these developments lag behind demographic trends. Care for
chronic illnesses has become the most common reason why Ameri-
cans seek medical care. By 2000 an estimated 125 million Americans
had one or more chronic conditions and were responsible for 75
percent of health spending.! By 2020 a projected 157 million Ameri-
cans will have one or more such conditions, accounting for 80 per-
cent of health spending."
I Inadequate clinical information systems. A lack of conver-
gence between persons' needs and the system's orientation can lead
to numerous problems. Most clinical information systems, for exam-
ple, do not permit clinicians to know what other clinicians are doing
for a patient. Our analysis of Medicare claims data suggests that the
average Medicare beneficiary with one or more chronic conditions is
seen by eight different physicians during a year; this indicates that
the potential scope of the problem is quite large.# The need for
coordination of care and integrated information systems becomes
especially important when a person has multiple chronic illnesses
(for example, heart disease, asthma, and depression), each of which
might require treatment by a different specialist. In these cases, each
clinician may be unaware of the exact treatments being delivered by
the others.
A national survey conducted in 2000 indicates some of the impli-
cations of inadequate communication among clinicians. Approxi-
mately twenty million Americans with chronic illnesses received
contradictory information from different health care providers dur-
ing the year, eighteen million received a contradictory diagnosis for
the same chronic illness, and seventeen million reported going to the
pharmacist only to be told of a potential drug/drug interaction.$
Better communication among clinicians could reduce these numbers.
I Preventable hospitalizations. Ambulatory care­sensitive
conditions are hospitalizations that might have been prevented
with good ambulatory care.% We compared the number of such con-
ditions in Medicare beneficiaries with one chronic illness to those
with five or more chronic illnesses. Our analysis of the 1999 Medi-

care 5 percent standard analytic file shows that only 0.8 percent of
Medicare beneficiaries with one chronic illness were hospitalized
with an ambulatory care­sensitive condition during the year. How-
ever, 12.8 percent of beneficiaries with five or more chronic illnesses
were hospitalized with an ambulatory care­sensitive condition.
I Insurance coverage. Health care benefits generally provide
better coverage for acute episodes than for ongoing care. Medicare,
for example, does not cover some services needed by beneficiaries
with chronic illnesses, the most prominent being prescription
drugs. In addition, definitions of medical necessity, used by insurers to
decide if certain services will be reimbursed, frequently restrict re-
imbursement to situations in which the person is showing improve-
ment. As a result, services designed to slow the progression of a
chronic illness may not be covered. For example, physical therapy
coverage may end if the person is not showing any improvement,
even though the treatment objective is to slow the progression of
disease or maintain the present level of mobility.
Cost-sharing provisions are another coverage issue that may dis-
proportionately affect persons with chronic illnesses. Such persons
are more likely to spend more out of pocket on coinsurance and
copayments and because of their higher use of services that their
insurance does not cover.&
I Provider payment. Payment systems are oriented to acute
episodes. Some systems do not pay providers for the time they spend
coordinating care with other providers. Payment rates are typically
greater when the physician is treating an acute episode than when
he or she is providing ongoing care or counseling. Physicians and
other health care providers may respond to these signals and empha-
size episodic over ongoing care.'
I Coordination of care. Most clinical education programs em-
phasize hospital-based, episodic specialty care. As a result, less at-
tention may be given to comorbid conditions or the need to coordi-
nate care with other clinicians. Studies have shown that physicians
are less likely to give adequate attention to chronic conditions that
are unrelated to the reason for the patient's visit. An estimated
sixty million Americans had multiple chronic illnesses in 2000, and
the number is projected to increase to eighty-one million by 2020.
Clinical education programs need to give greater attention to coor-
dination of care for these persons.
Functional Limitations
Functional limitations are a second way of identifying persons with
special medical and supportive care needs, although some may have
both chronic illnesses and functional limitations. Generally, func-

tional limitations are measured using activities of daily living
(ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), although
other instruments have been used. Approximately fifteen million
Americans had a functional limitation in 1995.!
I Evolution of the long-term care system. The financing and
provision of supportive services evolved very differently from those
of medical care. Unfortunately, the differences in organization and
financing are never clear to most people until the need arises for
long-term care.
Long-term care services, such as custodial nursing home and per-
sonal care, were considered "social" rather than "medical" services
by the crafters of early health insurance plans, and this perspective
was adopted by the designers of Medicare. Thus, long-term care
developed in an environment where the Medicare program did not
provide long-term care benefits, and, with the exception of Medic-
aid, the medical model, not the supportive care model, has been
adopted by most other third-party payers.
I Insurance coverage. Most health insurance plans do not pay
for custodial long-term care services. Medicare, for example, pays
for some long-term care when it is rehabilitative, such as care after a
stroke or a hip replacement. This means that benefits are limited
because services are covered only as long as the person is showing
improvement. Most private insurers have similar provisions. Medic-
aid is the major public source of service funding for persons with
functional limitations. Other public sources include state-only pro-
grams, Administration on Aging programs, and Title XX of the So-
cial Security Act, all of which provide support mostly for home and
community services.
While the coverage and protection offered by these policies has
improved over the years, limitations still exist. Insurance coverage
for supportive services is less extensive than that for medical care
services. Generally, eligibility criteria for public coverage include
both functional limitation and financial criteria. Insurance coverage
can have a major influence on treatment options. A physician, for
example, needs to consider one range of possible services for a
middle-income elderly person who has supportive care needs but
can consider a different range of services for a poor elderly person
who is eligible for Medicaid. Ironically, because of better coverage
for supportive services under Medicaid, a poor person is likely to be
"Under Medicaid, a poor person is likely to be eligible for a wider
array of services than is a middle-income person."

eligible for a wider array of appropriate services than is a middle-
income person.
I Supportive care system. The actual delivery of formal, paid
supportive services includes a panoply of systems that vary with a
person's specific needs. Services vary from "meals on wheels" pro-
grams to highly skilled nursing home care. Often, supportive serv-
ices are not organized in a way that a frail person or a family can
understand the full range of available services, how the services can
be obtained, the costs and available subsidies, and the pros and cons
of each type of service. According to a national survey, the most
common information source about supportive services remains fam-
ily and friends."
A combination of scarcity of funding, complex eligibility require-
ments, and preferences of families has meant that informal care
continues to be the most common method of providing supportive
services. Almost two-thirds of those with functional limitations
who live in the community receive support exclusively from family,
friends, and volunteers.# Fewer than 10 percent rely exclusively on
formal, paid long-term care providers. Recent estimates suggest that
the economic value of informal caregiving far exceeds what is spent
on formal long-term care services.$
I Other concerns. First, most information systems do not allow
the various supportive care providers to share data on their patients.
In addition, a person's medical care provider often will have little if
any contact with the long-term care provider, and rarely will the
medical care provider offer advice to the long-term care provider
about managing the person's care.
People beginning to need supportive services often go as long as
possible before entering the long-term care system when their con-
dition has reached a crisis point. A detailed study of how people
enter the long-term care system in Springfield, Massachusetts, for
example, documented the unmet long-term care needs that occur for
persons who lacked coordination of care.% Most people who started
to receive supportive care services did so only after some acute
exacerbation, many of which might have been avoided if the person
could have found needed long-term care services earlier.
Coverage for long-term supportive services is likely to be re-
stricted to persons who qualify for Medicaid. As a result, only per-
sons with low incomes and no assets can receive extended long-
term care services. Although there is growing private long-term care
insurance, out-of-pocket spending remains the most common
means of paying for long-term supportive services for those who do
not qualify for Medicaid.

Disability
The distinction between functional limitations and disability can be
blurry because the definition of a disability may refer to functional
limitations or ADLs. Government and insurance programs use the
terms disability and functional limitations differently, however, when
determining eligibility requirements.
According to the Institute of Medicine, disability "is the expres-
sion of a physical or mental limitation in a social context--the gap
between a person's capabilities and the demands of the environ-
ment. People with such functional limitations are not inherently
disabled...It is the interaction of their physical or mental limitations
with social and environmental factors that determines whether they
have a disability."& The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
defined disability as a "a physical or mental impairment that substan-
tially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individ-
ual."' Almost fifty million Americans have a disability according to
U.S. Department of Education estimates. 
Government agencies have applied these definitions in multiple
ways to identify persons who qualify for specific government pro-
grams. The Social Security Act, for example, requires the use of one
of the most restrictive criteria to determine who qualifies for disabil-
ity benefits, primarily because its definition of disability incorpo-
rates vocational criteria.  Workers' compensation law defines dis-
ability more broadly as "reduced capacity to perform the activities of
daily living or work." The Department of Education uses a two-part
qualification criterion to administer the Individuals with Disabili-
ties Education Act (IDEA). According to the IDEA criterion, the
child must have one or more of a specified list of disabilities but also
be evaluated by a team of educators to determine if special education
and related services are required. !
Navigating A Convoluted System
Persons who need access to multiple programs are most likely to
find that each program has different eligibility criteria, has different
sets of providers, and is not organizationally linked. Very simply,
these persons will be on their own to coordinate most of the services
they receive and will find baffling inconsistencies about which serv-
ices are covered and which are not. Only the most aggressive will
receive all of the services they are entitled to.
We used the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to ex-
amine the number and characteristics of persons who have one or
more chronic illnesses, functional limitations, or disabilities. " Ac-
cording to our analysis, 128.2 million noninstitutionalized Ameri-

cans (48 percent of the population) had a chronic condition, func-
tional limitation, or disability in 1996, and 9.5 million persons had all
three (Exhibit 1).
I Implications of meeting multiple criteria. The 141 million
persons with no chronic conditions, functional limitations, or dis-
abilities in 1996 had the lowest direct medical and indirect costs,
had the least amount of health care use, and were most likely to be
working or in school (Exhibit 2). # For the 87.8 million Americans
with chronic conditions only, their costs and use of services was
greater, and their school and work attendance was lower. For the
21.5 million Americans with one or more chronic conditions and a
disability, the costs and utilization are nearly double, and the per-
centage going to work or school is nearly half the rate of those with
a chronic condition only. The 9.5 million Americans with one or
more chronic conditions, disabilities, or functional limitations have
costs that are approximately sixteen times greater than those with-
out any chronic conditions, disabilities, or functional limitations;
are ten times more likely to be hospitalized; are twice as likely to use
physician services and prescription drugs; and are one-sixth as
likely to be in school or working.
I Characteristics of persons with more severe problems. In
1996 an estimated 22.3 million noninstitutionalized Americans had
three or more chronic conditions but did not have a severe disability
or a functional limitation (Exhibit 3). There were 12.8 million non-
institutionalized Americans who had various combinations of se-
vere disabilities, severe functional limitations, and/or three or more

tions, a severe disability, or a severe functional limitation.
When we disaggregated the MEPS data by three age groups
(5­17, 18­64, and 65+), most of the trends shown in Exhibits 2 and 4
remained valid (data not shown). Most of the differences were an-
ticipated: For example, a much lower percentage of people over age
sixty-five were working or in school. The analysis by age did show
one surprising difference: Children with disabilities and functional
limitations appeared to have greater difficulty carrying out their
daily activities than adults (ages 18­64) did, perhaps because dis-
abled children are likely to have developmental difficulties, particu-
larly mental retardation, that inhibits normal school progress.
Delivery System Challenges
A challenge to policymakers in the coming decades will be to make
it easier for persons with special medical and supportive needs to
receive appropriate care. A wide range of experts have suggested
that persons with special medical and supportive care needs would
benefit if medical, disability, and supportive services were better
coordinated. Walter Leutz, for example, makes the case that inte-
gration should improve efficiency, user satisfaction, and actual out-
comes. $ How this integration could be accomplished is the subject

of great debate. The following section focuses on two factors: (1)
eligibility and coverage standards, and (2) professional culture.
I Different eligibility and coverage standards. Different eligi-
bility standards can make it difficult for a person with multiple
special medical and supportive care needs to receive appropriate
care. Most supportive services are means-tested, most medical serv-
ices are not, and most disability income programs are dependent on
the person's ability to return to work or school.
Return-to-work incentive. In the United States, a key driver in the
design of disability programs is the concern that cash payments will
erode work incentives. The primary objective of most disability
income-support programs is to have people return to work as soon
as possible. Workers' compensation experts have expressed con-
cern that the duration of medical services or rehabilitation services
may be limited to accomplish this. % The push to return people to
work can also impede access to medical services because of the
eligibility link between income support and medical services. For
example, the loss of Medicaid benefits typically is associated with a
determination that the person no longer qualifies for Supplemental
Security Income (SSI) benefits. As a result, there is concern that
health insurance may not be available once the person has returned
to work. Programs such as Ticket to Work and new Medicaid pay-
ment options are recent attempts to rectify this problem.
Funding "games." A second problem is that funding for different
services often comes from different programs. Unfortunately, most
programs have a financial incentive to shift expenditures from their
program to other programs. For example, the parents of a child who
qualifies for both Medicaid and special education could find them-
selves negotiating with both programs, each of which wants the
other program to pay a larger share of the cost. These funding
"games" are also played across different levels of government. For
example, states may encourage providers to substitute services that
are covered by Medicare for services covered by Medicaid even
when the person could do equally as well with a lower-cost service
that is covered by Medicaid. &
Different payment systems. A third problem is that different third-
party payers use different payment systems to reimburse providers.
Workers' compensation programs, for example, typically pay much
more than Medicaid programs do. As a result, providers may have
different financial incentives to treat patients in different ways de-
pending on the funding source.
Perhaps less well known is that individual third-party payers also
use different payment systems for different types of providers. This
can make coordination of care across providers difficult. The March

2001 Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) report,
for example, lists eleven different payment systems used by Medi-
care to pay its providers. ' This report identifies three problems that
could affect Medicare beneficiaries if the payment systems are not
aligned and rates not set appropriately. First, if some payments are
set too high and others set too low, then "providers have incentives
to shift the mix of services they produce towards relatively profit-
able services and away from unprofitable ones." Second, when rates
are set too high or too low, providers have incentives to furnish too
many units, "exposing patients to unnecessary health risks," or too
few units, causing providers to "limit patients' access to care or stint
on the services." Third, in the absence of risk adjusters for managed
care plans, "providers have incentives to engage in risk selection,
seeking only the least costly patients and avoiding those who are
expected to need unusually expensive care."
Coordination of care. Another problem is that most payment sys-
tems do not explicitly reimburse any provider for coordination of
care. Instead, the coordination function is included in the evaluation
and management fee that clinicians may receive as part of a visit.
This fee is not dependent on the number of chronic conditions a
person has or the number of clinicians involved. As a result, some
clinicians may be unwilling to undertake the considerable effort to
coordinate care across multiple clinicians and institutions.
Managed care plans could improve coordination of care. How-
ever, staff and group models--which were organized to emphasize
coordination of care--have not emerged as the dominant organiza-
tional approach. The fastest-growing forms of managed care, inde-
pendent practice associations (IPAs) and preferred provider organi-
zations, have not focused on coordination of care.
One approach that could improve coordination across different
programs is to give individuals greater autonomy over their spend-
ing. For example, the Cash and Counseling Demonstration and
Evaluation operated by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is an attempt to
integrate income support and service benefits. Cash and counseling
programs are intended to educate Medicaid beneficiaries about the
range of available services and thereby give them greater choice and
freedom in obtaining the assistive services they need. This includes
purchasing services such as transportation or hiring family members

or friends as caregivers. Although cash payments are designed to
cover services, they can be used to support family members as
caregivers, thus indirectly providing additional family income. Par-
ticipants can carry over their cash benefits in special accounts, which
enables them to save for a time when extra services may be required.!
I Professional culture. Most services and treatment protocols
are now organized to take care of medical "episodes," not ongoing
care. The typical physician generally thinks in terms of his or her
"day's appointments." Most of these appointments are triggered be-
cause a patient with a chronic condition has an immediate medical
problem. The strength of this approach is that it is strongly oriented
toward problem solving, at which most physicians are adept. This is
how medical school and residency programs train physicians, and
payment systems reinforce it. Unfortunately, the model does not
work well for persons with chronic conditions, because the focus is
on "appointments" and not on people. This focus often means that
the same physician may not see that person when the next problem
occurs. Ten percent of persons with chronic conditions report that
they do not have a usual source of care.!
More training is needed in ambulatory care settings, where ongo-
ing care of chronic conditions, functional limitations, and disabili-
ties can be emphasized. Medical school curricula and residency
training are being slowly revised to respond to the growing number
of persons with chronic conditions. The American Academy of Pedi-
atrics (AAP), for example, recently published a comprehensive re-
view of pediatrics education that calls for major changes in pediatric
education.! The AAP recognizes that "although pediatricians in
past decades spent much of their time dealing with acute illnesses,
the care of patients with chronic conditions is now beginning to
dominate many pediatric practices." Similar efforts are occurring in
other medical specialties and among medical school deans.
Achieving Coordination And Integration
The medical, supportive care, and disability systems need to provide
better services to persons with chronic conditions, functional limi-
tations, and disabilities. First, it is important for coordination to
occur within each sector. The more difficult challenge, however, will
be to integrate programs across the three. One approach is to create
integrated financing and delivery programs. For example, the social
health maintenance organization (S/HMO) and Program of All-
Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) models integrate acute care
and some coverage for long-term care into one delivery system. A
number of states are experimenting with integration approaches for
frail populations who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.

Other programs give persons more autonomy and encourage self-
determination. This may be appropriate for some people as long as
they and their providers have the requisite information. Cash and
Counseling, Ticket to Work, and linkages between SSI and Medic-
aid are other examples.
If coordination within and across the programs is so important,
why is it not happening more regularly? One explanation is that
individual programs have their own constituencies. Long-term care,
medical care, and disability income-support programs have different
orientations and supporters. Providers develop around these pro-
grams and form a second constituency for the status quo.
The problems of care coordination are subtle, and often the issue
does not capture the attention of the public until they personally face
complex coordination problems. Also, while many people see the
problems caused by poor coordination, they generally do not have
enough knowledge to frame possible solutions. Without a demand
"push" for improvements by the public, changes will occur slowly.
Policymakers need to take the lead in crafting solu-
tions. Because so many of those with special medical and sup-
portive care needs are covered by government programs, gov-
ernment policymakers can help to identify specific solutions.
Breaking down government "silos" that inhibit integration across
multiple programs is one approach. It is also critical for actual
providers of care and the leaders of health care delivery organiza-
tions to devise creative organizational solutions to meet the care
needs of this population. For the system to change substantially, the
public, policymakers, and providers will all need to recognize the
number of people having difficulties with the current system and
initiate solutions.

tions.
NOTES
1. How each of these numbers was derived is explained later in the paper.
2. In this paper a chronic condition is one that has lasted or is expected to last
twelve months or longer and either requires ongoing medical care or places
limitations on at least one of the following: age-appropriate task performance,
basic self-care, independent living skills, or social interactions.

the ambulatory care group (ACG) classification system. For aged Medicare
beneficiaries who were classified as having a chronic condition, we counted
the number of visits to different physicians during the year. Some visits may
not have been related to the chronic condition, but this cannot be ascertained
from the claims data.
6. Harris Interactive conducted a nationally representative telephone survey of
1,669 Americans from March to November 2000 (54 percent response rate) to
determine if they had a chronic condition. They were given the same definition
of a chronic condition as in Note 2. Those with a chronic condition were asked
a series of questions about their interaction with the health care system. Based
upon the number of people who responded that they had a chronic condition
and the percentage who said they had a problem with the health care system,
we estimated the number of Americans with a particular problem with the
health care system. Harris Interactive, Survey on Chronic Illness and Caregiving

24. MEPS is a national random survey of 22,061 Americans. How chronic condi-
tions were identified is discussed in Note 2. Functional limitations were
defined as the need for help or supervision with any ADLs or IADLs. Disability
was defined by either (1) the use of assistive technology; (2) difficulty walking,
climbing stairs, grasping objects, reaching overhead, lifting, bending or top-
ping, or standing for long periods of time; (3) any limitation in work, house-
work, or school; (4) social/recreational limitations; (5) cognitive limitations
such as confusion or memory loss, problems making decisions, or requiring
supervision for their own safety; (6) vision problems, such as blindness, inabil-
ity to read newsprint or recognize familiar people; (7) deafness or difficulty
hearing; (8) age-related limitations for children; or (9) presence of a physical
or mental health problem that limited school attendance or required a special
school program for children.
