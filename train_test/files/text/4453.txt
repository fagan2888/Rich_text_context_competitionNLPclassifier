Background and Objectives
Due to climate change, changes in many extreme weather
and climate events have been observed since about 1950
(Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change [IPCC], 2013).
Particularly, excessive heat and heat waves are a growing
threat to public health. The heat wave in the summer of 2003
in Europe resulted in more than 70,000 deaths,1 in particular
of the elderly (Robine et al., 2008). Morbidity and mortality
of the elderly increase during and after heat periods, as has
been shown for several locations in Europe (e.g., Fouillet
et al., 2008) and the United States (e.g., Anderson & Bell,
2009). Climate change models project near-term increases in
the duration, intensity, and spatial extent of heat waves and
warm spells (IPCC, 2013).
Communication of climate change risks and adaptation
options--including procedures for education and participa-
tion--can play an important role in increasing protective
behavior and thereby decreasing vulnerabilities to climate
change (Grothmann, 2014). Related to the risk of increasing
heat waves, the most widely documented policy for reducing
heat vulnerabilities to date is the adoption of heat warnings
and air quality alert systems to trigger emergency responses
(Harlan & Ruddell, 2011). Nevertheless, in their review
study on the effectiveness of public health interventions in
reducing morbidity and mortality during heat episodes,
Bassil and Cole (2010) conclude that the evidence for a posi-
tive impact of communicative public health interventions

A Five-Steps Methodology to Design
Communication Formats That Can
Contribute to Behavior Change: The
Example of Communication for
Health-Protective Behavior Among
Elderly During Heat Waves
Torsten Grothmann1, Markus Leitner2, Natalie Glas2,
and Andrea Prutsch2
Abstract
Communication measures can raise protective behavior regarding climate change, natural hazards, and other health risks.
For being effective in such communication, we designed a five-steps methodology and applied it to health-protective behavior
during heat extremes in Austria. The five steps are as follows: (1) target group selection, a multicriteria assessment (MCA)
to identify the most important target group(s)--this led to the identification of mobile health care nurses as our primary
target group; (2) target group analysis by interviews to identify drivers of and barriers to protective behavior--for the mobile
health care nurses, the drivers were their climate change perceptions, control beliefs, perceptions of role models, and extent
of thinking about heat and health, and the barriers were fatalism and work stress; (3) development of target group specific
communication formats addressing the identified drivers and barriers--for the nurses, we designed a workshop format,
animated videos, and two print formats; (4) pretest of formats in focus groups--these revealed our formats were effective in
increasing heat risk awareness, competence, and protective behavior among the nurses; (5) improvement of formats based
on pretest results--for example, we modified the workshop format to become a venue for mutual learning. These five steps
can be applied to other projects where awareness, competence, or behavior shall be increased by means of communication.

during heat waves is limited and that the most vulnerable
groups are not being adequately reached.
With this in mind, we aimed at developing communica-
tion formats, which have the potential to be more effective
than previous communicative public health interventions
during heat waves, in the project CcTalk!2 We focused on the
development of communication measures only, as other vul-
nerability reduction measures (e.g., urban greening to
decrease air temperature in urban areas) have not been pos-
sible within the scope of this project.
In addition to developing communication formats that
contribute to reducing vulnerabilities of the elderly during
heat waves, we also wanted to address the following three
gaps in previous scientific work and communication
practice:
·
· Publications in the heat and health domain mostly
address either perceptions of health risks and options
for protective behavior (e.g., Abrahamson et al., 2008;
Akompab et al., 2013; Lane et al., 2013; Toloo,
FitzGerald, Aitken, Verrall, & Tong, 2013) or com-
munication interventions such as heat warnings to
increase risk awareness and protective behavior (e.g.,
Bassil & Cole, 2010; Bouzid, Hooper, & Hunter,
2013; Lowe, Ebi, & Forsberg, 2011; White-Newsome
et al. 2014). Publications that link knowledge about
influential perceptions (e.g., those which act as driv-
ers of or barriers to protective behavior in a particular
group) with the development of communication inter-
ventions that are able to change these influential per-
ceptions (e.g., by increasing perceptions that motivate
protective behavior) are lacking. Making this link is
an integral step in marketing approaches that develop
their marketing instruments for specific target groups
(e.g., television spots) from systematic analyses of
these groups. It is surprising that such marketing
approaches have been used in several projects to
influence mitigation of climate change (primarily to
reduce household energy use; see Maibach, Roser-
Renouf, & Leiserowitz, 2008), but have rarely been
used to influence adaptation to climate change such as
protective behavior during heat extremes. Therefore,
it was an objective of the CcTalk! project to systemati-
cally use the results of target group analyses on influ-
ential perceptions to develop effective communication
formats that are able to change these influential
perceptions.
·
· Much of the development of communication formats,
not only in the domain of adaptation to climate change
but also the public health domain, lack a systematic
understanding of the drivers of and barriers to protec-
tive behavior. Psychological research on perceptions
and behavior regarding natural hazards and other health
risks has identified a number of determinants (e.g., risk
perceptions, self-efficacy beliefs, etc.) of protective
behavior, including self-protective and altruistic behav-
ior, and has systematized these determinants in theories
such as Protection Motivation Theory (PMT; Rogers,
1983; Rogers & Prentice-Dunn, 1997), Health Belief
Model (HBM; Champion & Skinner, 2008; Hochbaum,
1958), and Norm-Activation Theory (NAT; Schwartz,
1977). Furthermore, psychological intervention
research has identified a number of effective interven-
tions to change people's risk awareness and behavior
(e.g., Mosler & Gutscher, 1998). The CcTalk! project
aimed to make use of this scientific knowledge to
develop target group specific communication formats.
It was not the aim of CcTalk! to test, compare, or
improve psychological theories of protective behavior
or effective interventions. Therefore, this article aims at
presenting the use (not a test, comparison, or improve-
ment) of psychological knowledge and theories (such
as PMT, HBM, NAT) for the design of communication
measures that have the potential to contribute to behav-
ior change.
·
· Most of the current practices in communication of cli-
mate change adaptation have not been empirically
evaluated regarding their effectiveness in creating
awareness for climate change risks and stimulating
adaptation action (Wirth, Prutsch, & Grothmann,
2014). "Although there are many guidelines for cli-
mate communication, there is little empirical evidence
of their efficacy" (Pidgeon & Fischhoff, 2011, p. 35).
The same situation seems to apply to interventions
regarding health risks of heat waves. Eight years ago,
the World Health Organization (WHO; 2009) stated,
"There is a lack of targeted, systematic reviews to
identify and assess the effectiveness of interventions
to control key climate-sensitive health risks, for
example, for the control of vector-borne diseases, or
heat health action plans" (p. 9). Since then, some stud-
ies tried to evaluate the effectiveness of heat wave
early warning systems (Bassil & Cole, 2010; Lowe
et al., 2011), but it remains largely unclear which
communication formats work for reducing vulnerabil-
ities and which do not. Furthermore, evaluations have
focused on heat wave early warning systems. Other
methods of communication such as education tools to
train professionals like mobile health care nurses for
heat waves have not yet been evaluated. Hence, fol-
lowing the claim "it should be no more acceptable to
release an untested communication than an untested
drug" by Fischhoff (2007), a further objective of the
CcTalk! project was to evaluate its communication
formats prior to their broad dissemination (p. 190).
In sum, the overall aim of the project was to develop com-
munication formats that have the potential to be more effective
than previous communicative public health interventions dur-
ing heat waves. The specific aims were to (a) systematically
Grothmann et al. 3
use results of target group analyses on perceptions that influ-
ence behavior to develop effective communication formats
that are able to change these influential perceptions, (b) pres-
ent the benefits of using scientific psychological knowledge
for the design of communication formats, and (c) evaluate
communication formats prior to their broad dissemination.
To address these objectives, we developed a five-steps
methodology for designing communication formats that sup-
port the motivation of protective behavior in various risk
domains (e.g., climate change, natural hazards) and applied it
to health-protective behavior during heat extremes inAustria.
The methodology strongly builds on psychological knowl-
edge about determinants of protective behavior regarding
health risks (e.g., Prentice-Dunn, McMath, & Cramer, 2009)
and on psychological methods for designing behavior change
interventions (e.g., Abrahamse & Matthies, 2012). The five
steps can be applied to various risks domains and are there-
fore meant as a general approach for communication
design--especially in the context of climate change adapta-
tion and protective behavior regarding heat extremes, where
such systematic methodologies are as yet very rare.
Paper Structure and Overview
The five-steps methodology includes the following:
1. target group selection by a MCA,
2. target group analysis by interviews based on psycho-
logical knowledge of determinants of protective
behavior,
3. development of communication formats based on
results of the target group analysis and on psycho-
logical knowledge of effective behavior change
interventions,
4. pretest of communication formats by focus group
workshops, and
5. improvement of formats based on pretest results.
In the following sections, these steps are presented in
detail. Every section first describes the methods applied in
the respective step and then presents our results related to the
design of effective communication formats for reducing the
vulnerability of the elderly during heat waves--the specific
topic addressed in the CcTalk! project.
Step 1--Target Group Selection:
Selecting the "Right" Target Group
Method
A systematic selection of the target group(s) is essential to
reach the communication aims. In the project CcTalk!, we
first compiled a list of potential target groups for communi-
cation aimed primarily at changing behavior to reduce vul-
nerabilities to heat waves. This list, specific to the health
sector in Austria, included groups such as the elderly, public
health authorities, pharmacies, health insurances, doctors,
kindergarten teachers, and mobile health care services.3
Second, we conducted a MCA to select our target groups.
Each of the groups identified in the first step was assessed
based on the following 10 criteria, which were developed in
the CcTalk! project and appear generalizable to other proj-
ects aiming at increasing awareness, competence, and pro-
tective behavior regarding risks such as climate change,
natural hazards, or other health risks.
 1. Negative future impacts of the risk (in this case, heat
waves) on the group
 2. Options for protective behavior in the group
 3. Low level of current protective behavior in the group
4. Low probability for future increase of protective
behavior in the group without additional measures
(like communication measures addressing the group)
 5. Urgency of protective behavior by the group (because
negative impacts have to be expected in the near
future)
 6. Relevance of the group to increase awareness of the
risk beyond the group (role as "awareness multipli-
ers," opinion leaders)
7. Relevance of the group to increase awareness of
options for protective behavior beyond the group
(role as "behavior multipliers," behavioral models)

8. Reachability of the group by communication
measures
 9. Existing contacts to the group
10. Willingness of group members to take part in focus
group workshops for a pretest of communication
formats
The first criterion applies to direct impacts (e.g., health
impacts of heat waves for the group of the elderly) as well as
indirect impacts (e.g., increasing workload for mobile health
care nurses during heat waves). Its assessment should be
based on current scientific knowledge.
Criteria 2 to 5 are closely linked to the aim of ensuring a
high level of protective behavior within the group. Criteria 6
and 7 assess the potential of group members to act as multi-
pliers and therefore address social network­level drivers of
behavior (cf. Maibach et al., 2008).
The eighth criterion requires an assessment whether a
group can be reached and influenced by communication for-
mats. Some groups seem relatively insensitive to communi-
cation formats. For example, public health authorities appear
to react mainly to laws and regulations, and less to commu-
nication measures such as flyers or brochures that are sent to
them.
The ninth criterion was included due to economic rea-
sons. A good and trustful contact to a group is often a neces-
sary condition for the willingness of group members to take
part in target group interviews (see Step 2) and in pretests of
4 SAGE Open
communication formats (see Step 4). Establishing such a
contact to a new group often requires a lot of time and effort,
but the CcTalk! project had a restricted budget. The tenth
criterion is closely linked to the specific method used in the
CcTalk! project for the pretest of the communication formats
(see Step 4). A focus group workshop requires that members
of the group are taking part, and for some groups, the will-
ingness to attend such a workshop can be expected to be
lower than for others.
The 10 criteria were assessed for all identified target
groups in the heat risk domain by all 10 project team mem-
bers individually (rating 0 = "criterion is probably not ful-
filled" or 1 = "criterion is probably fulfilled"). In a subsequent
discussion by the project team, those assessments were dis-
cussed for which there was a high level of disagreement.
These were assessments for which about half of the team
members had given a rating of 0, whereas the other half had
chosen a 1. Individual assessments could be changed after
the discussion. Finally, the ratings of all team members were
added for all criteria and those target groups were selected
that gained the highest rating sums.
Results and Discussion
Mobile health care nurses and kindergarten teachers got the
highest rating sums and were therefore selected as the pri-
mary target groups. In this publication, only the results for
the mobile health care nurses are presented. Mobile health
care nurses visit people in need of care--most of them are
older than 65--on a regular basis (once or twice a day).
One important reason for selecting mobile health care
nurses and not the elderly themselves as a primary target
group was that several publications (Abrahamson et al.,
2008; Bassil & Cole, 2010; Lane et al., 2013) report a lack of
self-perception as vulnerable among the elderly--obviously
leading to a lack of self-protective behavior (Bassil & Cole,
2010). Although one study (Alberini et al., 2011) does not
detect such a lack of self-perception as vulnerable, the major-
ity of studies indicate that older people are probably difficult
to reach by communication formats on heat-related health
risks, which led to low ratings for the elderly regarding
Criterion 8. As many of them, due to their lack of self-per-
ception as vulnerable, do not see any need to read or listen to
heat-related communication measures, these measures would
have no or only a minor effect on their risk awareness or
behavior (cf. WHO, 2011).
Furthermore, the following considerations were relevant
for selecting mobile health care nurses as a primary target
group. They can act as follows:
·
· "Protectors": They can directly reduce the vulnerabil-
ity of the elderly (e.g., by giving them something to
drink or by measures to cool down patients' bodies)
and thereby partly compensate for the lack of self-
protective behavior among the elderly;
·
· "Multipliers": They have regular personal contact
with the elderly and their relatives and know the med-
ical conditions of the patients. Hence, they can act as
awareness and behavior multipliers (see Criteria 6 and
7), who can tailor their communication to the specific
medical conditions of the patients;
·
· "Motivators": Due to their regular personal contact to
the elderly, they are also in a good position to moti-
vate self-protective behavior of the elderly, as studies
(e.g., Mosler & Gutscher, 1998) have shown that
direct face-to-face forms of communication are better
suited to change people's behavior than nonpersonal
forms of communication such as flyers or brochures,
especially if the communicators are known and
respected for their expertise regarding an issue.4
While the health care nurses were selected as a primary
target group in the CcTalk! project, the elderly and their rela-
tives were planned to be addressed as secondary target
groups--mainly via the health care nurses in their roles as
multipliers and motivators. The self-protective behavior of
the elderly was seen as essential to reduce their vulnerabili-
ties. Hence, they had to be addressed by the communication
formats as well. Furthermore, the social context of the
elderly, primarily their relatives, was regarded as an impor-
tant secondary target group because they can act as protec-
tors, multipliers, and motivators like the nurses.
Step 2--Target Group Analysis
Method
A recent WHO (2011) publication states, "one must know
what people think in order to design successful messages"
(p. 28). Accordingly, the aim of a target group analysis is to
find out as much as possible about the properties of the target
group that are of relevance for the design of the communica-
tion formats.
Although the analysis of publications (scientific or media
articles) that relate to the target group in question can be a
useful method for gathering data on a target group, in most
cases, a survey with members of the target group--by indi-
vidual or group interviews or by questionnaires--is neces-
sary. Most of the important questions about knowledge,
attitudes, opinions, preferred communication channels, and
so on in the target group can only be answered in this way. In
the CcTalk! project, we conducted half-standardized tele-
phone interviews with 30 female mobile health care nurses in
the provinces of Lower Austria and Burgenland, which
already had experienced heat waves in the past. The nurses
were identified and contacted via the higher management
levels of two major mobile health care providers in Austria
(Red Cross Austria, Caritas). Hence, the interviewed nurses
do not constitute a random sample. We interviewed the
nurses during the working time of the mobile nurses.
Grothmann et al. 5
Interviews took on average 40 min. Answers of the inter-
viewees were documented in note form by the interviewer
during the interviews.
The interview guideline (see the appendix) included 22
questions, was pretested, and was slightly adjusted based on
the pretest results. Similar to target group analyses in mar-
keting research, we asked for information needs of the inter-
viewees (Questions 17/18), perceived information needs of
those affected (Question 22), preferred information chan-
nels (Question 19), and potential multipliers for heat and
health information (Questions 20/21). Different from many
target group analyses in marketing research, we tried to
identify determinants of the current protection, multiplying,
and motivation behavior of the nurses (cf. differentiation of
three behavioral roles above: protectors, multipliers, and
motivators). We developed the respective questions mostly
from current scientific knowledge regarding potential driv-
ers of and barriers to the three types of behavior. Primarily,
three theories guided the questions included in the inter-
view: PMT (Rogers, 1983; Rogers & Prentice-Dunn, 1997),
HBM (Champion & Skinner, 2008; Hochbaum, 1958), and
NAT (Schwartz, 1977). PMT has already been successfully
applied to explain self-protective behavior regarding cli-
mate change and natural hazards (e.g., Grothmann & Patt,
2005). HBM is "one of the most widely used conceptual
frameworks in health behavior research" (Champion &
Skinner, 2008, p. 45) and has already been successfully used
to explain self-protective behavior regarding heat extremes
in Australia (Akompab et al., 2013). NAT has proven to be a
very useful theory to explain helping behavior in various
social settings so that we expected some explanatory power
also for protective behavior of mobile health care nurses
during heat extremes.
It was not the aim of the target group analysis to test spe-
cific theories of behavior or compare their explanatory
power. Instead, the various theories and publications on pro-
tective behavior were used to generate a list of potential
determinants of protection, multiplying, and motivation
behavior to identify the statistically significant determinants,
so that these could be addressed in the design of target group
specific communication formats. Mainly from PMT, HBM,
and NAT, we included 14 potential determinants--drivers
and barriers of the three types of behavior. Every potential
determinant was addressed by one specific question (see
Questions 1-10, 12, 13, 15, and 16 in interview guideline in
the appendix).
Furthermore, the interviews included an open-ended
question on the current behavior of the nurses (see Question
14 in interview guideline). By this question, we expected to
capture information regarding all three types of behavior we
were interested in. Unfortunately, the answers of most inter-
viewees related almost exclusively to protection behavior
regarding their patients, not to multiplying and motivation
behavior. Hence, we could not calculate quantitative mea-
sures of multiplying and motivation behavior, and in the
statistical analyses of the answers, we could only calculate
correlations of one type of behavior, protection behavior,
with the potential determinants (see "Results and Discussion"
of "Target Group Analysis" section).5
As the behavioral measure relied on self-reported infor-
mation only, we were concerned about getting biased answers
due to a potential tendency of the interviewees to give
socially desirable answers (in this case: to report more pro-
tection behavior than actually conducted). Therefore, we
included also a question measuring the tendency to give
socially desirable answers (see Question 11 in interview
guideline). As there was no correlation between the answers
to this question and the self-reported behavior, we concluded
that the behavioral measure was not biased by a social desir-
ability tendency.
All answers to the open-ended questions were categorized
according to qualitative content analysis (Mayring, 2000).
We then quantified potential behavioral determinants
(Questions 1, 4, 15, 16) and the behavioral measure (Question
14). For example, the behavioral measure was generated by
counting the number of performed behavioral categories
(e.g., shading the apartment, giving the patients something to
drink).
Finally, we calculated Kendall correlations6 between the
quantitative levels of the behavioral measure (Question 14)
and the quantitative levels of the potential behavioral deter-
minants (Questions 1-10, 12, 13, 15, and 16) of the inter-
viewed nurses. Multiple regressions could not be computed
due to the small sample size (N = 30) and the high number of
potential determinants.
Results and Discussion
The statistically significant correlations in Table 1 indicate
that the current protective behavior of the nurses is probably
driven by a perception of climate change, high control
beliefs, perceived role models for protective behavior, and
previous thinking about heat and health (positive significant
correlations), whereas fatalism and perceived work stress
obviously act as barriers to protective behavior (significant
negative correlations).7 We do not interpret these results as
direct influences of the statistically significant drivers and
barriers on the behavior. For example, the perception of cli-
mate change might have led to an increased thinking about
heat and health, which then led to an increase in protection
behavior.
Because almost all nurses (25 out of 30) answered with
the highest possible rating (6 = totally agree) to the question
measuring the perceived personal norm for protective behav-
ior during heat, there was a lack of variance in this variable
resulting in rather low correlations. Nevertheless, due to the
very high reported levels of this personal norm, we expect
that it also plays a role in causing protective behavior of the
nurses. To the open question on barriers to protection behav-
ior, six nurses named financial limitations of their patients,
6 SAGE Open
five named financial limitations of the mobile health care
service, and three mentioned the apartments of their patients
that are not adapted to heat.
The results also indicated that all interviewed nurses had
experienced heat events in the past, that most of them per-
ceive that their old patients suffer from heat, and that most of
the nurses also suffer from heat. They feel exhausted and/or
stressed during heat waves because they have to work hard
(e.g., lifting heavy patients) and their company car is heating
up strongly as they often have to park in the full sun and
drive only short distances from patient to patient so that air-
conditioning in the car has almost no effect or the company
cars do not have air-conditioning yet.
It is likely that their experience of heat events in the past
had contributed to their relatively high existing awareness of
heat-related health risks and to the result that all of the inter-
viewed nurses reported at least two types of protection
behavior. Nevertheless, we detected strong interindividual
differences: Some health care nurses seem to conduct much
more protective behavior than others. Hence, we regarded
the development of communication formats to further
strengthen and increase the protective behavior of the nurses
as useful, especially of those who as yet show only low lev-
els of such behavior.
Step 3--Development of Target Group
Specific Communication Formats
Method
The design of communication formats to further increase the
protection, multiplying, and motivating behaviors of the
mobile health care nurses strongly built on the results of the
target group analyses and followed the logic to
·
· fulfill the expressed information needs and to reduce
identified gaps in knowledge and behavior,
·
· use the preferred information channels and multipli-
ers, and
·
· address the identified drivers of and barriers to the
behavior. Hence, the communication formats that are
developed in Step 3 primarily target those perceptions
and beliefs that proved influential as drivers of or bar-
riers to behavior in Step 2.

Results and Discussion
About one third of the interviewed nurses expressed the
information need for concrete recommendations on effective
measures to prevent negative health effects during heat
extremes. None of the interviewed nurses mentioned the
regular measurement of the patients' body temperature or
medicine-related measures (heat-adapted dosing and stock-
ing of medicine) as their current behavior to protect their
patients from heat-related health effects. Therefore, we
wanted to develop communication formats that could pro-
vide such detailed information (e.g., brochures and/or train-
ing workshops).
Only very few interview statements related to multiplying
and motivating behavior. We concluded that, as yet, most
nurses do not see themselves as multipliers (of knowledge on
health risks and options for protective behavior) or motiva-
tors of protection behavior among the patients and the
patients' relatives. On the contrary, five interviewees men-
tioned the relatives of their patients and three interviewees
named the patients as barriers to the implementation of health
protection measures before and during heat extremes.
Therefore, we identified the need to strongly support the
nurses in their intended roles as multipliers and motivators.
Based on these results, we intended to develop communica-
tion formats that motivate the nurses for taking the roles as
multipliers and motivators (e.g., by stressing the high mortal-
ity among the elderly during heat waves in the past and by
eliciting feelings of solidarity with the elderly). Furthermore,
the communication formats should assist them in being
effective in these roles (e.g., by training them in persuasive
forms of communication and providing them with communi-
cation formats such as flyers, which they could use in their
interactions with the patients and their relatives in motivat-
ing them to take protective actions).
To address mobile health care nurses as the primary target
group and to also reach the secondary target groups, the
elderly and their relatives, we selected and designed four
communication formats: an expert workshop, a brochure,
animated videos, and a flyer. All formats have the same
heading/slogan ("Healthy Despite Heat") and all visual for-
mats (invitation letter for expert workshop, brochure, flyer,
animated videos) have a similar graphical design to allow the
use of the formats in an integrated communication campaign.
The formats are presented in more detail in Table 2. The
selection of these specific formats was guided by the follow-
ing rules from communication practice:
·
· create a combination of formats that is suited to reach
the different target groups via established communi-
cation channels,
·
· reach the target groups via various senses and activi-
ties (reading, listening, watching, speaking, etc.), and
·
· appeal to people on both the emotional and intellec-
tual level (emotions were mainly targeted by the
animated videos whereas the other formats rather
addressed knowledge aspects; cf. Slovic, Finucane,
Peters, & MacGregor, 2007).
Furthermore, the selection of the four formats was deter-
mined by the available financial and time resources for their
development.
To address the identified statistically significant drivers of
and barriers to the protection behavior of the nurses (see Table
1), we included the following information in the communica-
tion formats: Climate change and its relation to the increase of
heat extremes is mentioned in all four communication for-
mats to increase perceptions of climate change, which was
identified as a probable driver of protection behavior. To
increase control beliefs and decrease fatalism, the longest sec-
tions of all four communication formats are devoted to pre-
senting the many options for protection, multiplying, and
motivating behavior. To increase the perception of role mod-
els for protective behavior, we included a mobile health care
nurse, who is very experienced in dealing with heat-related
health issues, as one of the leaders of the expert workshop.
The animated videos were designed to present the risks and
protective options regarding heat extremes in a visually
appealing way and to provide links to further information, so
that thinking about heat and health, another identified driver
of protection behavior, is stimulated. To reduce the barrier of
perceived work stress, which is probably partly related to the
fact that the nurses themselves suffer from heat (see "Results
and Discussion" of "Target Group Analysis" section), we
included a section in the expert workshop devoted to the fol-
lowing question: How can mobile health care nurses protect
themselves from heat-related health impacts and work stress
during heat events? Nevertheless, the high negative correla-
tion between perceived work stress and protective behavior
also indicates that communication formats aiming at increas-
ing nurses' protective behavior will probably not suffice. In
addition, interventions aiming at improving nurses' working
conditions and reducing work stress appear necessary (cf.
McLeroy, Bibeau, Steckler, & Glanz, 1988)--interventions
that could not be planned in the CcTalk! project, which
focused on the development of communication formats.
To use the preferred information channels and multipliers
mentioned by the nurses in the target group interviews, we
focused on distribution channels via the work hierarchy of the
nurses. Twenty-four of the 30 nurses mentioned their superi-
ors as potential multipliers for heat and health information; 20
named these superiors as very influential in their work area.
Hence, to reach the mobile health care nurses (the primary
target group), we planned for communication formats to be
sent to them by mail or email via superiors. To reach the sec-
ondary target groups--the elderly and their relatives--the
mobile health care nurses are seen as important multipliers
(see Step 1), for example, to distribute the flyer to their
patients and relatives. Furthermore, the elderly can be reached
by animated videos if these are shown on TV, depending on

their health status. In the interviews, the nurses named TV as
the information channel mostly used by their patients.
As a central portal providing access to all developed
communication formats, an existing Austrian website for
information related to climate change adaptation (www.kli-
mawandelanpassung.at/kwa_hitzevideos) is used. Here, the
animated videos (available only in German) can be watched
via an embedded YouTube link; the flyer, brochure, and the
concept for the expert workshop can be downloaded.
In the development of the four communication formats, a
definition of specific objectives for each format has proven
to be useful. Through the formulation of these format-spe-
cific objectives, the work on the formats could be carried out
in a more focused manner than without such objectives. The
definition of these objectives was also a crucial basis for the
subsequent pretest of the communication formats, as this
pretest evaluated to what extent the objectives were achieved.
The objectives for the four communication formats are
included in Table 3.

Note. Objectives defined for the respective formats are marked by italics.
aDue to the restricted time frame for the focus groups, the concept of the expert workshop could only be presented and discussed superficially. Hence,
instead of assessing whether the workshop is reaching its objectives, the respective questionnaire assessed the willingness to take part in the workshop
and the acceptance of the lead by a medical doctor together with an experienced health care nurse. Objectives of the workshop were (a) building further
expertise and motivation for protection, multiplying, and motivating behavior; (b) discussing and giving answers to questions related to health protection during heat;
and (c) exchange of experiences and good-practice examples related to health protection during heat.

target group(s) is necessary in most cases. In the CcTalk!
project, we chose to conduct focus group workshops (a form
of group interview, which is often used in marketing research)
as the concrete method for pretesting and gathering ideas for
further improvement of our four communication formats
from members of the target group. Only members of the pri-
mary target group (mobile health care nurses) were included
in these focus group workshops. Due to resource restrictions,
we could not conduct focus group workshops with members
of the secondary target groups, the elderly and their relatives.
Therefore, we did not only ask the mobile health care nurses
in the focus group workshops how they evaluate the suitabil-
ity of the four communication formats for themselves but
also requested their opinions whether the formats are proba-
bly suited for the elderly and their relatives.
The advantage of focus group workshops is that their imple-
mentation is usually more cost-effective and less time-consum-
ing than performing individual interviews. Furthermore, such
workshops are well suited to developing new ideas for the
improvement of communication formats.Adisadvantage com-
pared with individual interviews is that the group process is
often characterized by evolving conversation from initial topics
of discussion, often meaning other topics are not discussed. To
minimize the influence of such group specific discussion pro-
cesses on the pretest results, we conducted two focus group
workshops with two groups of mobile health care nurses (one
with seven participants from Red Cross Austria, and another
with 11 participants from Caritas). Another disadvantage of
focus group workshops is that the evaluations of persons, who
are shy in a group situation, are generally underrepresented in
results.
To utilize advantages and compensate for respective
disadvantages, we used a combined individual and group
survey method in the CcTalk! project: closed-ended ques-
tionnaires, which were completed individually by the par-
ticipants of the focus group workshops (to gather the
individual evaluations of the four communication formats),
and open-ended discussions (to gather the collective evalu-
ations and develop ideas for further improvement of the
four communication formats). The 2-hr focus group work-
shops were divided into four format-specific blocks of dis-
cussion. At the beginning of each block, the format (e.g.,
the expert workshop) and respective target group(s) (e.g.,
mobile health care nurses) were presented. Each partici-
pant of the workshop was then asked to individually com-
plete a format-specific questionnaire, which assessed the
extent to which the objective of the respective format was
fulfilled according to her or his opinion (for questionnaire
items, see Table 3). Hence, the format specific objectives
that were defined in Step 3 of the five-steps methodology
to carry out the design of the communication formats in a
focused manner were "reused" as evaluation criteria here
in Step 4 of the methodology.
Finally, the professional moderator of the workshop led a
discussion on the following questions:
·
· What aspects (graphics, content, etc.) of the format do
you like?
·
· What aspects do you not like?
·
· What suggestions do you have for the improvement of
the format?
The discussions were tape-recorded and observed by two
independent observers who focused particularly on emotional
expressions (verbal and nonverbal) of the workshop partici-
pants, because emotions can indicate whether behavior is
motivated--the primary aim of the CcTalk! communication
formats.8 The moderator visualized the main results of the dis-
cussion on a flip chart, which helped to organize the discus-
sion and also served as a summary of the discussion results.
The quantitative results of the questionnaire were ana-
lyzed statistically (see Table 3). The two observer protocols
and the flip chart protocol by the moderator were content-
analyzed (Mayring, 2000). Only if contents of these three
protocols were unclear or contradictory, the respective parts
of the transcripts9 of the tape-records were included in the
content analysis.
Results and Discussion
The results of the pretest indicated that most of the objectives
of the communication formats could be reached (including
the motivation of protection behavior) but that some modifi-
cations to the formats would be useful to further improve
their effectiveness and practical usability. Table 3 includes
the individual questionnaire evaluations of the formats and
indicates that most of the format objectives were largely ful-
filled in the opinion of the mobile health care nurses that
participated in the focus group workshops. Only the fulfill-
ment of the brochure objective, to provide new information
to the nurses, got an average rating of lower than 3 in one
focus group--a result which can be explained by the fact that
the participating nurses already showed a very broad knowl-
edge regarding heat and health issues.
The results of the discussions indicated that the collective
evaluations of the four formats were generally quite positive.
Rather drastic animations of heat-related deaths in the heat-
risks-video were received positively. Although the many
dying animated characters were perceived as "brutal" or
"threatening," the nurses expressed that these drastic pictures
caught their attention but did not discourage them from tak-
ing protection measures. Accordingly, the observer protocols
indicated that, of all communication formats, the animated
videos resulted in the highest number of expressed emotions.
After showing signs of surprise and shock following the high
number of 70,000 deaths caused by the 2003 heat wave in
Europe, the nurses expressed joy and hope watching later
parts of the heat-risks-video. They also mainly expressed joy
and hope watching the tips-for-heat-video.
The workshop participants had several ideas for further
improving the different formats. One idea was attractive to
Grothmann et al. 11
many participants. It related to including a graphical presen-
tation of the sun as an intuitive symbol of heat in the bro-
chure, the flyer, and the invitation letter for the expert
workshop. Hence, in the revised versions of these formats, a
sun symbol was included and acted as a further design ele-
ment present in all formats, thereby contributing to the
potential use of different formats in an integrated communi-
cation campaign.
An interesting and unexpected result of the discussions
was that some nurses disapproved of the idea to include a
physician in the expert workshop. They felt very well
informed and competent regarding heat-related health risks
and health-protective measures so that they seemed uninter-
ested in listening to a physician in an expert workshop. Based
on this result, we decided to stress in the invitation letter for
the expert workshop that all participants of the workshop are
seen as experts, and that the workshop is a venue for copro-
duction of knowledge and mutual learning processes regard-
ing heat-related health risks and health-protective measures.
Overall Discussion
One of the aims of the CcTalk! project was to develop com-
munication formats that have the potential to be more effective
than previous communicative public health interventions dur-
ing heat waves, which had only limited impacts and could not
reach the most vulnerable groups (Bassil & Cole, 2010). The
focus group pretest of our communication formats indicated
that they were regarded as effective on various dimensions,
including the motivation of protection behavior. We believe
that this positive evaluation in the focus groups was very much
based on our systematic five-steps methodology for develop-
ing communication materials, which build on a psychological
understanding of determinants of protection behavior.
Nevertheless, we could not test whether our communication
formats were more effective than conventional public health
interventions during heat waves, because the realization of a
control group with conventional communication formats was
not possible within the scope of this project.
Furthermore, we wanted to address three gaps in previous
scientific work and communication practice:
·
· To address the lack of publications that link knowl-
edge about influential perceptions (e.g., influential as
drivers of or barriers to protective behavior during
heat extremes) in a particular group with the develop-
ment of communication formats that are able to
change these influential perceptions (e.g., increase
those perceptions that motivate protective behavior),
we have shown how the CcTalk! project--by building
on existing marketing methodologies (e.g., Maibach
et al., 2008)--systematically used the results of target
group analyses on influential perceptions to develop
effective communication formats that have the poten-
tial to change the influential perceptions.
·
· Communication, not only in the domain of adaptation
to climate change but also the public health domain,
often lacks a systematic psychological understanding
of the drivers of and barriers to human protective
behavior. Furthermore, results of psychological inter-
vention research are not adequately used. We have
presented how the CcTalk! project made use of results
and theories of psychological research on human per-
ceptions and behavior regarding natural hazards and
other health risks by including potential psychological
behavioral determinants known from psychological
literature in our interviews of the target group analy-
sis. We then addressed the statically significant deter-
minants in the design of our communication formats.
Furthermore, we made use of results from psychologi-
cal intervention research in the development of our
communication formats (e.g., by including face-to-
face forms of communication; cf. Mosler & Gutscher,
1998).
·
· To address the lack of evaluations of communication
formats in the domain of climate change adaptation
and interventions regarding health risks of heat waves,
we presented how we evaluated our communication
formats in focus group workshops (by using a com-
bined individual and group survey method).
Another aim of this publication was to portray a five-steps
methodology to design communication formats that support
the motivation of protective behavior in various risk domains
(e.g., climate change, natural hazards). Our application of the
methodology to design communication formats for stimulat-
ing health-protective behavior during heat extremes in
Austria has shown that it proved useful for developing for-
mats that are effective in raising awareness, building compe-
tence, and motivating protective behavior with regard to
heat-related health risks.
One particularly interesting result of the target group
analyses (Step 2) was that perceived work stress of the nurses
obviously negatively influences their protective behavior.
This indicates that communication formats aiming at increas-
ing nurses' protective behavior will probably not suffice. In
addition, interventions aiming at improving nurses' working
conditions appear necessary (cf. McLeroy et al., 1988) so
that they have the time to conduct heat protective behavior
such as washing patients' bodies with cool water.
Nevertheless, the five-steps methodology has some limi-
tations. It does not provide exact rules, neither for the selec-
tion and development of communication formats based on
the target group interview results nor for the improvement of
the formats based on the focus group workshop results. Here,
the CcTalk! project has shown that the development and
improvement of the communication formats do not only rely
on rational and scientific interpretations of the interview and
workshop results but also very much on the experience and
creativity of the designers of the formats.
12 SAGE Open
A further limitation of the methodology, as it was applied
in the CcTalk! project, considers the samples of the target
groups. Neither the nurses in the target group interviews nor
the nurses participating in the focus group workshops consti-
tuted representative random samples of all mobile health
care nurses in Austria. Generally, interviewing a representa-
tive sample of a target group is possible (e.g., by representa-
tive telephone surveys like they were conducted in the project
KommEx10 in Germany), but is often relatively costly and
was therefore not possible within the resources of the CcTalk!
project.
A final limitation we want to note here is that the pretest of
communication formats by focus group workshops does not
constitute a valid effectiveness evaluation of communication
formats. The evaluation of the formats in such a workshop is
an artificial setting. In reality, formats such as flyers or bro-
chures are not distributed and read in a workshop but people
find these in their mail or they are handed to them by col-
leagues or friends.Amore valid evaluation of communication
formats is a communication campaign evaluation that assesses
the level of awareness, competence, and/or behavior in a rep-
resentative sample of the target group before and after a com-
munication campaign and controls for other factors that might
contribute to changes in awareness, competence, and/or
behavior. Such a communication campaign evaluation is pos-
sible but is often not carried out due to its high costs.
Conclusion
Despite its limitations, the five-steps methodology presented
here could and should be used by authorities when trying to
affect people's behavior in a positive way by means of com-
munication--especially in the context of climate change
adaptation or protective behavior regarding heat extremes,
where such systematic methodologies are as yet very rare.
Second, the results also indicate that communication mea-
sures alone will not suffice. Work stress decreased the nurses'
protective behavior. Therefore, also interventions improving
nurses'working conditions appear necessary. This highlights
that communication measures should be part of systemic
intervention strategies directed at changing interpersonal,
organizational, community, public policy factors (McLeroy
et al., 1988), and infrastructures (e.g., urban greening to
decrease air temperature in urban areas) to reduce vulnerabil-
ities comprehensively.

3. The identification of target groups based on similarities in
knowledge, awareness, and attitudes within each group--so
called "segmentation"--is a more elaborate method for cre-
ating a list of target groups and is also recommended for
effective health communication campaigns (Slater, 1996).
Nevertheless, segmentation is costly and was not possible in
the CcTalk! project.
 4. The differentiation of these three behavioral roles--protectors,
multiplicators, and motivators--was developed in the CcTalk!
project.
 5. Other studies that would like to build on the interview guide-
line developed in the CcTalk! project should ask more explic-
itly for the various types of behavior in question than it was
done here.
6. Kendall correlations were better suited for our data than
Spearman correlations due to our small sample size (N = 30)
and the appearance of outliers in the data.

8. The observers used a standardized manual of emotions for
identifying and coding the reactions of the participants.
Although the observers were trained in identifying emotions
and using the manual, it became clear during the focus group
workshops that it was very difficult to identify emotions by
the participating mobile health care nurses. Many of them did
not express any emotions, neither verbally nor nonverbally,
probably because they thought that this would be regarded as
unprofessional.
 9. All verbal statements during the focus group workshops were
transcribed. This work-intensive procedure proved unneces-
sary in the course of the content analysis, which showed that
the two observer protocols and the flip chart protocol were suf-
ficient to document the main contents of the discussion.
10. For information on this project (full title "Ansätze und
Erfolgsbedingungen in der Kommunikation zum Umgang mit
Extremereignissen") see https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/

kation (German only).
11. These abbreviations refer to the theories of protective behavior,
in which the respective potential behavioral determinants are
included (see "Method" of "Target Group Analysis" section).
12. The answers to this question had to be erased from the statisti-
cal analyses because it measured a reasonable self-assessment
of the knowledge regarding health risks and protective behav-
ior options rather than a maladaptive coping response.
13. There was no theoretical foundation for including work stress
in the interview guideline but the knowledge in the project
team of the working conditions of mobile health care nurses
in Austria. We knew that work stress was an issue for many
mobile health care nurses and hypothesized that this stress
could become a barrier to their protection, multiplicating, and
motivation behavior during heat waves.
14. Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), Health Belief Model
(HBM), and Norm-Activation Theory (NAT) differentiate
self-efficacy and outcome-efficacy beliefs. To keep the inter-
view guideline short, we decided to measure control belief,
14 SAGE Open
which measures self-efficacy and outcome-efficacy beliefs in
an integrated manner.
15. As the answers to the according question were highly depen-
dent on the previous question regarding the current behavior
of the interviewees, this confounded variable was not included
in the correlation analyses (see "Results" of "Target Group
Analysis" section).
16. The answers to this question were very limited because the
interviewees showed signs of interview fatigue when this
question was asked. Consequently, the data on perceived barri-
ers were not included in the correlation analyses (see "Results"
of "Target Group Analysis" section).
