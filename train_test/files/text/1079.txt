Context: Little is known about differences in the un-
met need for mental health service use between African
Americans and Caribbean blacks.
Objective: To extend the National Survey of Black
Americans by examining 12-month mental health ser-
vice use for African Americans and Caribbean blacks from
the recently completed National Survey of American Life.
Design and Setting: National household probability
samples of noninstitutionalized African Americans and
Caribbean blacks (blacks from Caribbean area coun-
tries now living in the United States) conducted be-
tween February 2001 and June 2003, using a slightly
modified World Mental Health version of the World
Health Organization's Composite International Diagnos-
tic Interview.
Participants: A total of 3570 African Americans and 1621
Caribbean blacks 18 years and older (N=5191).
Main Outcome Measures: Proportion of respon-
dents with 12-month DSM-IV disorders who sought help
in the specialty mental health, general medical, human
service, and complementary-alternative medicine treat-
ment sectors. The percentage receiving minimally ad-
equate treatment was also assessed.
Results: Overall, 10.1% of respondents used some form
of mental heath care services in the past year. Use of ser-
vices was much higher among those who met criteria for
a 12-month DSM-IV disorder (31.9%) than among those
who did not (5.4%). Forty-nine percent of respondents
with serious mental illness used services, whereas 39.3%
had contact with mental health care specialists. The
youngest and oldest age groups were least likely to ob-
tain any services. Among African Americans, women were
more likely than men to use general medical care and ser-
vices from any sector. Respondents with the most years
of education showed the highest use of services.
Conclusions: The underuse of mental health services
among black Americans remains a serious concern. Edu-
cational interventions that focus on both consumers and
mental health care professionals are needed.

TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO, THE
National Survey of Black
Americans (NSBA) pro-
duced the first national data
on how symptoms of dis-
tress are defined and responded to by black
Americans.1,2 The NSBA found that most
black Americans did not seek mental
health services in response to emotional
distress. Predating the DSM-III, the men-
tal health need-assessment approach taken
by the NSBA grew out of an epidemio-
logic tradition that emphasized how varia-
tion in personal problem definitions is re-
lated to patterns of help-seeking behavior.3
Interestingly, because personal distress was
defined from a lay community perspec-
tive and not within a medical diagnostic
taxonomy, it was difficult to draw firm con-
clusions about the extent of unmet need
for mental health treatment on the basis
of the NSBA.4,5 In this article, we use data
from the recently conducted National Sur-
vey of American Life (NSAL) to examine
help seeking for mental disorders in an eth-
nically diverse sample of black Ameri-
cans. The NSAL extends the NSBA in 2 im-
portant ways. First, the NSAL uses the
Composite International Diagnostic In-
terview to estimate service use among per-
sons with DSM-IV criteria for selected men-
tal disorders. Second, it addresses the issue
of black ethnic variation by including
samples of both African Americans and Ca-
ribbean blacks.
It is estimated that Caribbean-de-
scended and immigrant groups consti-
tute 10% to 15% of the United States' black
population. Studies6 of multiple racial and
ethnic groups reveal that groups of color

are as likely to differ from each other as they are to differ
from white Americans. Unfortunately, no studies have
addressed black ethnic variation in help seeking for men-
tal disorders within the United States. The few studies7-9
that have examined help seeking among Caribbean blacks
have been conducted in the United Kingdom. As a re-
sult, many questions remain unanswered regarding
whether Caribbean blacks and African Americans actu-
ally differ in mental health service use.
Studying blacks of different ethnic origins is impor-
tant for public mental health service professionals be-
cause of questions about the contribution of culture to
population group differences in behavior.10-13 Hypoth-
eses related to assumed differences in such social pro-
cesses as group identity, acculturation, nativity, and im-
migration suggest that sociodemographic factors have
differential effects on treatment seeking across different
ethnic groups.14-17 Although such an initial demographic
analysis cannot speak directly to culture, it begins to iden-
tify directions for future research on differences in psy-
chosocial processes related to culture and mental health.18
Given the virtual absence of findings in this area, we
take an exploratory, descriptive approach to this first ar-
ticle on mental health services. Nevertheless, on the ba-
sis of findings from the general services literature and our
previous work with African Americans, we have some ex-
pectations. We predict that Caribbean blacks will be less
likely than African Americans to use medical and men-
tal health services. We predict significant differences in
the use of services for other demographic variables, al-
though we are unsure about how uniform these relation-
ships will be across the 2 ethnic groups and across the
multiple service domains explored. Specifically, we pre-
dict that both income and education will show a posi-
tive relationship with use of services, that women will
be more likely than men to use services, that insured
people will be more likely than uninsured people to seek
professional help, and that the oldest respondents (65
years) will be least likely to use services.
In summary, the NSAL is an excellent resource to ex-
plore the extent to which both groups receive mental
health services and the nature of ethnic differences in the
unmet need for mental health care. No national studies
have measured the prevalence of mental disorders in con-
junction with help seeking in representative national
samples of both African American and Caribbean blacks.
This article describes the use of general medical, spe-
cialty mental health care, human services, and comple-
mentary-alternative medical resources for mental health
problems and selected, discrete mental disorders.
METHODS
SAMPLE
The NSAL was part of a National Institute of Mental Health Col-
laborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys initiative that also
included the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R)
and the National Latino and Asian American Study.19 The NSAL
was an integrated national household probability sample of 3570
African Americans and 1621 blacks of Caribbean descent 18
years and older. The African American sample was selected ex-
clusively from geographic segments in proportion to the Afri-
can American population; the Caribbean black sample was se-
lected from the African American segments and additional
metropolitan segments in which blacks of Caribbean descent
made up more than 10% of the population.20 In both the Afri-
can American and Caribbean black samples, it was necessary
for respondents to self-identify their race as black. Those self-
identifying as black were included in the Caribbean black sample
if they answered affirmatively to any of these inclusion crite-
ria: (1) West Indian or Caribbean descent, (2) from a Carib-
bean area country, and/or (3) parents or grandparents were born
in a Caribbean area country. Most interviews (88%) were con-
ducted face to face and 12% by telephone, using a computer-
assisted instrument and lasting an average of 2 hours 20 min-
utes. Data collection was completed between February 2, 2001,
and June 30, 2003. The overall response rate was 72.3%: 70.7%
for African Americans and 77.7% for Caribbean blacks.
MEASURES
Diagnostic Assessment
We measured DSM-IV disorders, both lifetime and 12 month,
with the World Mental Health Composite International Diag-
nostic Interview, a structured diagnostic interview; mental dis-
orders sections were modified versions of those developed for
the World Mental Health project.21 The 18 twelve-month men-
tal disorders assessed were as follows: anxiety disorders (panic
disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disor-
der, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive dis-
order, which was assessed using the Composite International Di-
agnostic Interview Short Form),22 mood disorders (major
depressive disorder, dysthymia, and bipolar I and II disorders),
substance disorders (alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, drug
abuse, and drug dependence), childhood disorders (opposi-
tional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, asked only of respondents in the 18- to
44-year age range), and eating disorders.
Severity of Mental Disorder
Respondents who reported 12-month suicidal ideation or at-
tempts, who had at least 1 nonaffective psychotic symptom plus
ever being treated for psychosis, or who met 12-month crite-
ria for at least 1 disorder were divided into 1 of 3 severity gra-
dients: serious, moderate, or mild. Severity was primarily as-
sessed using measures of role impairment derived from the
Sheehan Disability Scale.23 The significant positive relation-
ship between the severity measure and 30-day disability, rang-
ing from a low of 0.96 disability day for respondents with mildly
severe mental disorders to more than 5 disability days for those
with serious mental disorders, speaks to the validity of the dis-
ability measure.
Service Use
Respondents were asked if they had made contact with any-
one from a list of health care professionals for problems with
their emotions, nerves, mental health, or use of alcohol or drugs
in the past 12 months. Health care professionals were catego-
rized into a mental health sector (psychiatrists, psychologists,
counselors and social workers seen in mental health settings,
other mental health care professionals, and mental health hot-
lines) and a general medical sector (general physicians, family
physicians, physician specialists, nurses, occupational thera-
pists, and other health care professionals). The term nonpsy-
chiatrist refers to psychologists, counselors, and social work-

ers seen in a mental health care setting. The nonÂ­health care
sector included human services (religious and spiritual advis-
ers and counselors and social workers seen in nonÂ­mental health
settings) and complementary-alternative medicine (herbal-
ists, chiropractors, spiritualists, self-help groups, and Internet
support groups). Twelve-month service use was defined as mak-
ing at least 1 visit to a service provider within the 12 months
before the interview.
Minimally Adequate Treatment
Minimally adequate treatment was defined separately for each
12-month disorder in a manner consistent with that used in
the NCS-R,24 as reporting either (1) at least 4 visits with any
physician and receiving appropriate pharmacotherapy for at least
60 days during the past year or (2) at least 8 psychotherapy
visits, each averaging 30 minutes or more, with any other health
care professional within the health care or human services treat-
ment sectors. Complementary-alternative medicine was con-
sidered adequate only for substance disorders and only if re-
spondents attended at least 8 self-help sessions of any duration
during the past year. Appropriate pharmacotherapy for disor-
ders included antidepressants for depression and dysthymia,
mood stabilizers or antipsychotics for bipolar disorders, anti-
depressants or benzodiazepines for anxiety disorders, and di-
sulfiram for substance disorders.
Sociodemographic Correlates
Sociodemographic correlates include race/ethnicity (African
American or Caribbean black), age (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, or 60
years), sex, highest level of education attained (0-11, 12, 13-
15, or 16 years), marital status (married or cohabiting, pre-
viously married, or never married), household income
($18 000, $18 000-$31 999, $32 000-54 999, or $55 000),
employment status (working vs not working), and whether the
respondent had health insurance.
ANALYSIS STRATEGY
Cross-tabulations are presented to illustrate ethnic differ-
ences in 12-month service use. The Rao-Scott 2 represents a
complex design-corrected measure of association. Logistic re-
gression was used to examine the main effect of ethnicity on
service use, adjusted for demographic variables and having any
12-month DSM-IV disorder. To account for multiple compari-
sons, 2 values were estimated for the overall type III effects of
each categorical predictor variable within the contexts of the
multivariate models. Standard errors and 95% confidence in-
tervals reported in this article reflect adjustment for the sam-
pling design. Unless otherwise stated, P.05 on a 2-sided de-
signÂ­based test of significance represented the cutoff for assessing
statistical significance. All analyses were conducted using SAS
statistical software, version 9.13, which uses the Taylor expan-
sion approximation technique for calculating the complex de-
signÂ­based estimates of variance.25
Since the NSAL used a multistage sample design, involving
both clustering and stratification, specialized statistical tech-
niques to account for the complexity of the design and associ-
ated standard errors were used. Standard errors calculated on
the basis of a simple random sample would not reflect the true
variation of estimates in the NSAL, resulting in an increased like-
lihood of type I errors (declaring a result to be significant when
it is not). Because standard errors adjusted for complex design
are usually larger than nonadjusted standard errors, differences
may appear to be large yet not statistically significant. Further-
more, the Caribbean black sample is significantly more clus-
tered than the African American sample, so the standard errors
for the Caribbean black sample are usually higher than those for
the African American sample when correctly estimated.
RESULTS
Table 1 focuses on the demographic correlates of 12-
month service use in response to problems with emo-
tions, nerves, mental health, or use of alcohol or other
drugs in the past 12 months. Overall, 442 (10.1%) of the
NSAL respondents used some form of services for men-
tal heath care in the past year. African Americans and Ca-
ribbean blacks differ in the use of nonhealth services (132
[4.1%] and 40 [1.8%], respectively), with African Ameri-
cans more likely to use help. The youngest and oldest
age groups are least likely to obtain any services in re-
sponse to mental health problems. Women are more likely
than men, those not married are more likely than mar-
ried individuals, and those working are more likely than
those not working to use any services.
Table 1 also gives the demographic correlates of use
for African Americans and Caribbean blacks. Among Afri-
can Americans, age is related to the use of all service sec-
tors but only to the use of psychiatrists for Caribbean
blacks. Among African Americans but not Caribbean
blacks, women are more likely than men to contact gen-
eral medical care, nonhealth sectors, or any services. Both
African Americans and Caribbean black respondents with
16 or more years of education have the highest use of
nonpsychiatric mental health professionals. Among Afri-
can Americans, previously married respondents report
more use of services than those who are currently mar-
ried or living with their partner. Employed African Ameri-
cans are more likely than those not working to use all
service sectors except for nonpsychiatric and nonhealth
sectors. Insured Caribbean blacks are more likely than
uninsured individuals to use psychiatrists or all services
combined. Insurance coverage has no influence on the
use of services by African Americans.
Table 2 indicates use of services by sex and ethnic-
ity by level of mental disorder severity. Although only
179 respondents (4.8%) without mild, moderate, or se-
rious mental disorder use any services, 84 respondents
(48.8%) with serious disorder use any services. A simi-
lar relationship is seen for each service sector. Examin-
ing those with serious disorders, similar percentages of
both African Americans (50 [39.1%]) and Caribbean
blacks (17 [41.5%]) obtain help from any mental health
service. Within the mental health services sector, how-
ever, a much higher percentage of African Americans com-
pared with Caribbean blacks (42 [34.4%] and 14 [18.6%],
respectively) seek help from psychiatrists. The reverse
occurs for the use of nonpsychiatrist mental health pro-
fessionals; 10 Caribbean blacks (37.5%) and 27 African
Americans (19.4%) obtained help from these types of pro-
fessionals for serious disorders. Roughly comparable per-
centages of both ethnic groups with serious disorders seek
help from the general medical care sector. Among Afri-
can Americans with serious disorders, a higher percent-
age of men than women use both psychiatrists (19 [43.7%]
vs 23 [27.9%]) and nonpsychiatrist mental health thera-

pists (10 [24.8%] vs 17 [15.7%]). On the other hand, a
higher percentage of women than men with serious men-
tal illness seek the help of general medical care profes-
sionals. For Caribbean blacks, the opposite occurs; women
use more mental health services than men, but men use
more medical services than women.
Table 3 presents service sector use for each disor-
der separately for African Americans and Caribbean
blacks. Use of services was much higher among those who
met criteria for a 12-month DSM-IV disorder than among
those who did not; 238 (31.9%) of those with a disorder
obtained some type of help, whereas only 204 (5.4%) of
those without a disorder did so. The use of any services
for any mood disorder is higher for African Americans:
92 (43.5%) compared with 30 Caribbean blacks (22.9%).
The same is true for the use of psychiatrists (37 [17.8%]
and 11 [4.0%], respectively) and general medical care (45
[21.0%] vs 6 [12.5%], respectively). A sizeable percent-
age of Caribbean blacks, however, use psychiatrists for
bipolar disorder (6 [16.1%]), which is much more than
for dysthymia (1 [1.1%]) and major depression (9 [4.1%]).
Comparatively large percentages of African Americans
use psychiatrists for major depression (32 [18.6%]), dys-
thymia (11 [20.9%]), and bipolar disorder (10 [20.7%]).
Similar differences are found between African Ameri-
cans and Caribbean blacks in the use of psychiatrists for
any anxiety disorder (44 [14.4%] vs 13 [4.0%]), but again,
not for nonpsychiatric mental health professionals, from

whom 41 African Americans (14.3%) and 12 Caribbean
blacks (16.4%) received care. African Americans and Ca-
ribbean blacks are more similar in the use of any health
services for any anxiety disorder (87 [28.6%] and 28
[29.4%], respectively) but not for any mood disorder (73
[34.6%] and 25 [20.4%], respectively). In general, Ca-
ribbean blacks are more likely to obtain mental health
care from nonpsychiatrist mental health professionals than
from psychiatrists for each disorder type. These differ-
ences are not present for African Americans.
Table 4 gives the results of multivariate logistic re-
gression analyses that estimated the effect of ethnicity and
other demographic measures to each service use sector,
adjusting for any 12-month mental disorder. Ethnicity
is not related to specialty mental health service use. Afri-
can Americans, however, are 2.7 times more likely than
Caribbean blacks to use nonÂ­health care services. Table 4
also indicates that the use of any services is associated
with being 30 to 44 and 45 to 59 years old, female, and
insured and having 16 or more years of education. Age
is similarly related to the use of any mental health ser-
vices. Those 18 to 29 years old are significantly less likely
than the older age groups to use general medical care for
treatment of mental problems. Women are more likely
than men to use general medical care and any nonÂ­
health care services. Those with insurance are more likely
than the uninsured to use a psychiatrist or any health ser-
vices. Previously married respondents are more likely than
the married and never married to use nonÂ­health care
services. Those with the highest level of education were
more likely to use all health-related services sectors than
those with lower educational levels. Having a disorder
increases significantly the use of all service sectors.
Table 5 indicates the proportion of African Ameri-
cans and Caribbean blacks who are receiving minimally
adequate treatment by service sectors. Overall, 63 (26.2%)
received minimally adequate treatment, but the percent-
ages varied noticeably in the service sector, ranging from
18 (10.5%) in the general medical sector to 56 (30.0%)
for any mental health care services (41 [29.3%] to psy-
chiatrists and 28 [28.5%] to nonpsychiatric mental health
care professionals). The percentages of patients who are
receiving minimally adequate treatment are higher for Ca-
ribbean blacks than for African Americans, but large stan-
dard errors make conclusions about Caribbean blacks
problematic.

COMMENT
The NSAL has several strengths. First, the NSAL assesses
the presence of mental disorders, thereby addressing a
major limitation of data gathered in previous mental
health surveys that focused on black Americans. Second,
the study includes a large representative sample that
permits the identification of mental health differences
among groups often lumped together within the black
American population. These types of analyses are critical
because of changing immigration patterns and diverging
socioeconomic conditions that have occurred within the

used novel geographical screening procedures that
ensured that every African American household in the
continental United States had a known probability of
selection.1,26,27 In addition, new methods were developed
to ascertain the influences of structurally missing mem-
bers of black households (eg, young men in prisons) on
sampling and disorder estimates.1 Fourth, all respon-
dents were selected from the targeted geographic seg-
ments in proportion to the African American and Carib-
bean black population, making this the first national

who live in the same contexts and geographical areas
(high- and low-density, urban and rural areas).

ternational Diagnostic Interview does not include the
DSM-IV diagnoses of schizophrenia or other nonaffective
psychoses. In addition, the NSAL did not collect data on
specific phobias or intermittent explosive disorder. Sec-
ond, because homeless and institutionalized individuals
were not included, prevalence estimates are likely lower
than reported. Those who did not speak English were not
included, which underrepresents French-, Spanish-, and
Creole-speaking Caribbean blacks. These groups are rela-
tively rare in the United States, so their exclusion should
have minimal effects. Another limitation is the global na-
ture of our designation of Caribbean ancestry, which is
characterized by heterogeneity that we were not able to
fully explore owing to sample size limitations. Because of
the high clustering of Caribbean blacks and a relatively
smallersamplesize,theiradjustedstandarderrorsaresome-
times large. A final limitation is systematic nonresponse
to various questions. Some nonrespondents may have met
the criteria for a DSM-IV disorder.
Despite the popular view that African Americans and
Caribbean blacks represent different cultural heritages,
they did not differ much in the use of services. Differ-
ences observed between these 2 ethnic groups were largely
due to different relationships among demographic groups
to mental health service use. This finding suggests the
presence of interactions among ethnicity, use of ser-
vices, and a third demographic variable. We tested the
effect of sex and ethnicity on any services use and found
that the relationship of sex to use depended on ethnic-
ity. African American women were significantly more
likely to use services than African American men. No sex
effect was found among Caribbean blacks (data avail-
able from the author). The absence of sex effects on use
among Caribbean blacks is surprising, since black women
are typically more likely to use services than black men.28
The idea that requesting help is antithetical to male so-
cialization may not be uniform across all black men. Fu-
ture work will focus more explicitly on ethnic differ-
ences in the social construction of masculine identities.
The findings showed that age differences in mental
health care use deserve attention in future analyses of the
NSAL. The youngest and the oldest groups, especially
among African Americans, used services the least. These
age differences are consistent with other research in this
field.18,29 Age at onset of mood disorders, which tends to
occur at approximately 30 years, may account at least par-
tially for the lower use among young people.30 Older re-
spondents are known to underuse mental health ser-
vices because of greater perceived stigma.
There was little evidence that respondents with higher
incomes are more likely to use services. Education, on the
other hand, showed a positive relationship with service
use. These findings are consistent with the notion that, al-
though related, income and education capture distinc-
tiveaspectsofsocioeconomicposition.31 Educationislikely
a proxy for knowledge, greater attentiveness to mental
health information, and awareness of the availability and
acceptability of seeking help for mental health prob-
lems.32 Differential access to services based on income may
be less striking in this sample because of working people
having health insurance and poor people having Medi-
caid.17 Placing income and education in the same model
may account for some of the same variance, and the ef-
fects of income may be mediated through education. The
lack of an income effect might also be attributed to the size-
able proportions of both African Americans (65.9%) and
Caribbean blacks (62.9%) who had mental health care in-
surance. This level of insurance coverage is comparable
to that in whites, and as a result, statistical power was not
a problem on the basis of a restricted range of insurance
coverage. There may be more of an insurance effect than
we were able to capture given our additive modeling ap-
proach. Clearly, we need to know more about how both
socioeconomic status/position and insurance in combi-
nation affect use across all service sectors.
African Americans and Caribbean blacks who sought
professional help for mental health problems used gen-
eral medical care almost as much as specialty mental health
care. The relative accessibility of primary care physicians
and the limitations that most health insurance plans put
in place to control the use of specialty mental health care
make this the most likely pattern of use.33-35 The large per-

Use of any nonhealth professional was reduced to human services sector because complementary-alternative medicine is not considered adequate treatment for
most of the disorders and the sample reporting use of complementary-alternative medicine was small. Human services is defined as religious and spiritual advisers and

centages of African Americans and Caribbean blacks who
go to their primary care physicians for help with mental
health problems might be receiving inappropriate levels
of care. We believe that professionals trained especially to
deal with mental health problems (ie, psychiatrists, psy-
chologists, and social workers) are best suited to handle
the treatment of these mental disorders.
Although not the focus of the present study, the pro-
portion of NSAL respondents who obtained 12-month
service use (10.1%) is noticeably lower than the percent-
age reported by the NCS-R (17.9%).24 This finding is com-
pelling evidence that the black-white difference in the
use of mental health services remains an issue worthy of
more in-depth investigation. Differences were also found
in the sociodemographic correlates of 12-month service
use between the NSAL and the NCS-R; specifically, not
having a low family income, previously being married,
and not living in a rural area. Income and marital status
were not significant predictors of use in the NSAL, whereas
education was. These patterns suggest interesting inter-
actions among race, sociodemographic predictors, and
service use that can be explored once the NSAL and NCS-R
data are merged.
Some findings in the literature suggest that although
the black-white gap in use may be narrowing,36 racial dis-
parities may occur in the quality of mental health treat-
ment.37 Rates of minimally adequate treatment are lower
in the NSAL (26.2%) compared with the NCS-R (32.7%).
Although the level of minimally adequate treatment pro-
vided by the general medical sector is comparable across
the 2 studies (10.5% and 12.7%, respectively), mini-
mally adequate treatment received from psychiatrists is
noticeably lower in the NSAL (29.3% and 44.5%, respec-
tively).24 Such differences in treatment adequacy are wor-
thy of attention in future work.
Many black Americans who do not use services rely
on help from informal support networks and alternative
helpers, such as ministers.38,39 We were not able, in this
first article, to address specifically the role of faith-
based organizations and particularly the helping role of
clergy, which our previous work has shown to be im-
portant.40 We have begun to explore the use of clergy,
and preliminary results indicate a much higher clergy use
for mood and anxiety disorders among African Ameri-
cans than Caribbean blacks. The more pressing policy
question, however, is whether the seriousness of the emo-
tional challenges confronting all black Americans is ap-
propriately matched with the help sources to which these
groups turn. Many mental disorders require the atten-
tion of trained mental health care professionals. Despite
the positive aspects of informal help, social support is as
much a barrier to mental health care as an acceptable treat-
ment alternative.40-43
The mental health need-assessment tradition from
which the NSAL flows relied more on lay conceptualiza-
tions of distress than on professional judgments of need.
Although good clinical, scientific, and policy reasons ex-
ist for the development of highly structured survey in-
struments that can classify respondents by DSM-IV cri-
teria, this should not be the only approach to assessing
need for mental health services; not everyone in need of
mental health treatment meets the criteria for a disor-
der,37 and meeting these criteria may not be serious enough
to warrant treatment.30,44 People decide to seek profes-
sional help not because they know that they have a par-
ticular disorder but because the level of distress experi-
enced has exhausted the personal and social resources
used to cope with the emotional pain.44 The NSAL em-
braced each of these epidemiologic traditions, and fu-
ture work will explore both the lay taxonomy that
motivates the search for help and how well the concep-
tualization of distress represented by the DSM-IV pre-
dicts the need for services.45-48
Our findings demonstrate that underuse of mental
health services for both African Americans and Carib-
bean blacks remains a serious concern. As a result, edu-
cational interventions that focus on both black consum-
ers and mental health care professionals are needed.
Primary care physicians need to be educated on how best
to identify black individuals with serious mental health
problems and disorders. Mental health care profession-
als must incorporate knowledge about ethnic differ-
ences in idioms of distress and how to overcome feel-
ings of mistrust into their therapeutic approach. Mental
health educational programs must facilitate, among black
consumers, the recognition and definition of symptom
clusters that need to be treated by mental health care pro-
fessionals. Clearly, ways must be found to increase the
use of mental health care and to increase the quality of
that care among all black groups, irrespective of their eth-
nic heritage. The consequences in terms of needless pain
and suffering and unnecessary losses in productivity are
too great to ignore.
