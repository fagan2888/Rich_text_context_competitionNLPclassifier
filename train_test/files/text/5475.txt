Introduction
Fractal geometry provides effective tools for study of not
only physical but also social systems. The purpose of this
article is, first, to describe the analytical tools that fractal
modeling offers in the sociopolitical subject area and, sec-
ond, to examine the heuristic opportunities they bring. In
particular, we present results of the developed model's
approbation as applied to the modernization of sociopolitical
institutions.
The development of fractal models is part of the general
methodological trend aimed at the application of advances
in synergetics, chaos theory (Alekseev et al., 2007;
Borodkin, 2005; Guastello, 2013), and system approach
(Gharajedaghi, 2006) to the study of complex and dynamic
social systems.
Fractal models of social phenomena are used in econom-
ics, and in studies of spatial dynamics (Cirnu, 2014; De
Florio, Bakhouya, Coronato, & Di Marzo, 2013; Tannier,
Vuidel, Houot, & Frankhauser, 2012; Triantakonstantis &
Mountrakis, 2012). Economic applications of fractal model-
ing may even be found in classical works on fractal geometry
(Feder, 1988; Frame & Mandelbrot, 2002; Mandelbrot,
1982). A lot of fractal structures have been found in nature.
In addition, it has been found that the evolution of many sys-
tems (including social systems) is fractal in nature, that is, a
pink noise. It is a self-similar process in which events of all
sizes coincide: small bursts, average waves, tremendous tsu-
namis. The theory of self-organized criticality--the sibling
of fractal geometry--offers a universal explanation of the
pink noise origin (Bak, 1996). It has been found that many
different processes have fractal characteristics (e.g., the elec-
trical activity of the human brain, freshets, changes in quasar
brightness, the dynamics of market prices, the intensity of
social conflicts, the frequency of traffic jams). In theoretical
and review papers (Andergassen, Nardini, & Ricottilli, 2006;
Buchanan, 2000; Guastello, 2013; Mathews, White, & Long,
1999; Pinto, Mendes Lopes, & Machado, 2012; Turcotte &
Rundle, 2002), numerous allegations can be found that social
reality also has the characteristic of self-organized criticality.
There are researches specifically dedicated to fractal pink
noise in social processes (Biggs, 2005; Brunk, 2001, 2002a,
2002b; Cederman, 2003; Kron & Grund, 2009; Picoli, del
Castillo-Mussot, Ribeiro, Lenzi, & Mendes, 2014; Roberts
& Turcotte, 1998; Shimada & Koyama, 2015).

The Modeling of Institutional
Modernization by Means of Fractal
Geometry
Dmitry S. Zhukov1 and Sergey K. Lyamin1
Abstract
The article presents the General Fractal Model of Transit (GFMT) designed to apply modeling in the sociopolitical disciplines.
For the purposes of conducting computer experiments with the model, a "Modernofractal 5.1" program was created.
Constructing procedures for algebraic fractals enables to simulate social evolutions in the phase space, mainly their starting
and end points. The GFMT formula iteration simulated interaction of a series of abstract governing factors, which may be
treated as the most significant for different social systems under the stage of transformation. The GFMT has the potential
"tuned," made more specific, for studying various social phenomena. The authors examined the heuristic opportunities of this
analysis tool as applied to the fields of historical and political science research (the object of study was rapid modernization
of institutions with informal "game rules"). The article contains descriptions of several GFMT computer experiments
demonstrating the analysis tools and interpretability of outcome data.

However, to carry fractal geometry over to large-scale
social phenomena, there is a need for some sort of interdisci-
plinary dialogue, which we attempt to conduct here. For our
analysis, we chose the important social problem of transfor-
mation of traditional informal institutions (TIIs). In their
pathological form, TIIs are regarded by researchers as the
main obstacle to social progress. This is a key idea in funda-
mental theoretical writings (Knight, 1992; North, 1990), in
analytical summaries on this subject (Helmke & Levitsky,
2004; Merkel & Croissant, 2000), in concrete political sci-
ence studies (Lauth, 2000; Pejovich, 1999; Polyakov, 2011;
Seltser, 2009), and in practice-oriented expert recommenda-
tions (Boesen, 2007).
We used fractal models to study quite a wide range of
objects--modernization of sociopolitical institutions, demo-
graphic strategies of the traditional society, human pressure
on the environment in history, evolution of territorial admin-
istration in empires of the Modern period, and so forth (e.g.,
Zhukov, Kanishchev, & Lyamin, 2013a, 2013b; Zhukov &
Lyamin, 2010). Fractal models are able to discover and simu-
late nonlinear effects that appear in social systems (Borodkin,
2012). We believe, therein lies the heuristic value of this tool.
The building of fractal models and computer experiments
with them do not actually provide empirical facts at the his-
torian's, political scientist's, or sociologist's disposal. But
models may be seen as a "heuristic machine" of its own kind
that helps formulate hypotheses and discovers potentials and
alternative developments (Axelrod, 2005; Badham, 2010;
Epstein, 2008; Frigg & Reiss, 2009; Kuppers, Neslenhard, &
Shinn, 2006). Russell Ackoff viewed virtual experiments
with models as a substitute for the real ones that are near
impossible to be carried out with regard to social objects:
In a sense the researcher into the operations of many social
systems is in a situation similar to that of the early astronomers;
the system they studied also seemed to be infinitely complex and
yet incapable of being subjected to experimentation. However,
astronomers eventually developed mathematical representations
(models) of the systems, and analyzed or conducted experiments
on these models. (Ackoff & Emery, 2009, p. 230)
Why Are Fractal Geometry Tools
Applicable for Simulating Real Social
Systems?
Fractal geometry emerged after Benois Mandelbrot's book
Les Objets Fractals: Forme, Hasard et Dimension, which
was published in 1975. The revised version of the mono-
graph, "The Fractal Geometry of Nature," is now a seminal
work on fractal geometry. A fractal is defined as a special
type of geometric figure, and the adjective "fractal" is the
characteristic of a structure, phenomenon, or process pos-
sessing properties of the fractal. Mandelbrot (1982) himself
defined fractal as a structure whose parts "in some sense" are
like the whole. Therefore, one of the fractal's attributes is
self-similarity (scale invariance): Whichever approximation
we look at the fractal, we always see the same or, in any case,
something similar. In Figure 1, some scales of the Sierpinski
Sieve fractal (Mandelbrot, 1982) are presented to illustrate
the scale invariance.
Fractal's self-similarity may be nonabsolute. Figure 2
demonstrates fragments of the best known fractal--the
Mandelbrot (1982) set. In this case, the self-similarity is
transformed at different scales, but at every level of com-
plexity (at every scale), there appears a fusion of the indi-
vidual characteristics of an element and the general ones of
the whole system.
Mandelbrot (1982) suggested that in nature, a fractal way
of self-organization was essential, because algorithms of
fractal building had a relatively simple "genetic code" (a
basic principle of building), yet at the same time they could
produce supercomplex objects or processes.
Subsequent to natural sciences, principles and tools of frac-
tal geometry are mastered in humanities. In the monograph
"Fractals, Graphics and Mathematical Education," Mandelbrot
quite remarkably, reflects on history and fractal geometry:
Let me at this point confess to you the envy I experienced as a
young man, when watching the hold on minds that is the
privilege of psychology and sociology, and of my youthful
dreams of seeing some part of hard science somehow succeed in
achieving a similar hold. Until a few decades ago, the nature of
science made this an idle dream. Human beings (not all, to be
sure, but enough of them) view history, psychology, and
sociology as alive . . . Astronomy is not viewed as alive; the Sun
and the Moon are superhuman because of their regularity,
therefore gods. [ . . . ] In recent years the sharp contrast between
astronomy and history has collapsed. We witness the coming
together, not of a new species of science; nor even (to continue
in taxonomic terms) a new genus or family, but a much more
profound change. [ . . . ] It is only since the 1960s that the study
of true disorder and complexity has come onto the scene. Two
key words are chaos and fractals, but I shall keep to fractals.
Again and again my work has revealed cases where simplicity
breeds a complication that seems incredibly lifelike. [ . . . ]
Astronomy described simple rules and simple effects, while
history described complicated rules and complicated effects.
Fractal geometry has revealed simple rules and complicated
effects. (Frame & Mandelbrot, 2002, pp. 25-26)
Fractal models allow the discovery of patterns and strict
ordering in such systems where, seemingly, absolute chaos
of multidirectional human aspirations and diverse empirical
facts dominate. The consistency of the basic pattern does not
contradict the diversity of facts under study. Fractal geome-
try unites them, but at the same time it does not lay them
down to the Procrustean bed of simple schemes.
The most "ancient" type of fractals is geometrical frac-
tals. They are a convenient heuristic metaphor for describing
self-similar social and political structures, as well as logics
of their development. Geometrical fractals are figures that
emerge as a result of repetition of one and the same graphic
Zhukov and Lyamin 3
element (a so-called "fractal generator") for an infinite num-
ber of times at a constantly reducing scale. Examples of such
figures are the Sierpinski Sieve (Figure 1) or the Koch
Snowflake (Mandelbrot, 1982; Figure 3) fractals.
Fractals of another type--algebraic--emerge in a com-
plex numbers space as a result of iterations of a particular
formula. Algebraic fractal building may be seen as a study of
the system's behavior in the phase space. That is the princi-
ple implemented in General Fractal Model of Transit
(GFMT).
How GFMT and Modernofractal 5.1
Fractal-Builder Work
For the purposes of computer modeling in social and politi-
cal disciplines, we offered the GFMT. The mathematical
apparatus of the model is based on procedures described by
Mandelbrot (1982). These classical methods were modified
to solve issues of simulating specific studied objects. The
GFMT is a mathematical and logic matrix of a class of theo-
ries, which describe transformation, transition of social
systems from one state to another. Here, we demonstrated the
GFMT application to studying problems of institutional
modernization, but there are also successful outcomes from
using the model for other processes-related research.
In GFMT, various states of the system in any moment are
depicted by means of an image point (complex number Z) in
the two-dimensional phase space. This point's position cor-
responds to values of key system characteristics plotted
along phase space axes. State transition (transformation) of
the system at any time is represented by the sequence of
points--namely a certain trajectory in the phase space.
To conduct computer experiments with GFMT, Julia
Movchko designed the Modernofractal 5.1 computer pro-
gram that performs algebraic fractal-building procedures.1
Fractal geometry reveals the mechanisms by which com-
plex and diverse structures can be generated on the basis of
very simple rules. The same is true of software that models
real processes. The fractal generating programs are mostly
rather simple. They use very simple algorithms--repetition
of basic computational operations. Because of this, there are
a lot of fractal generators, but none of them is quite a

versatile enough program for modeling. Therefore, we
needed a special program that could resolve the specific
research problem.
The mathematical apparatus of the model contains an iter-
ated formula (1) and two mathematical conditions (the so-
called -symmetry rule, -symmetry rule), that allow us to
equate the geometrical sense of complex numbers operations
with the results of nuclear interactions of a model's factors.

where A is a real number, Z (d

) and  (d

) are com-
plex numbers.
The iterated formula generates a sequence of numbers that
are taken as coordinates and, therefore, set an image point
trajectory in the complex plane (the very same, two-dimen-
sional phase space of the model).
Why and how can iteration simulate the evolution of the
social system? Let us compare the iterative process in a frac-
tal model with procedures of agent-based modeling. There
are similarities and differences.
In agent-based modeling, individual agents interact with
each other, guided by simple rules and conditions. The result is
a new, complex, and sometimes paradoxical behavior of the
whole artificial society--the entire set of agents. Thus, the
agents' basic interactions at the microlevel generate system
microdynamics.
In fractal modeling, the system is not broken down into
individual components or agents; rather, it is the system's
whole dynamics that are broken down into individual situa-
tions. Each situation is a short-term and basic change of the
whole system under the influence of controlling factors. The
formula (1) governs the interaction of controlling factors and
their influence upon the system in the simplest situation.
Each change in the system is manifested in the iteration. The
position of the image point in the phase space changes as a
result of the iteration. A series of iterations simulates a series
of changes. During a single iteration or a small number of
iterations, the system's behavior tends to be very simple.
However, the set of iterations can create a nontrivial trajec-
tory. Thus, the elementary behavior of the system in short
periods of time generates a long-term system dynamics.
A researcher has the opportunity to observe point trajecto-
ries tracing starting points (creation states of the system) and
finishing stable points (if any)--attractors of the system evolu-
tion. The fractal-builder computer program can, therefore, gen-
erate images of system attractors (we will call them
"perspectives'space" for our purposes) and basins ("potentials'
space"). If we consider the complex plane as a two-dimensional
phase space, the movement of the image point may be identi-
fied as the system evolution. The basins (the whole complex of
starting points from which the system gets into one or another
attractor) highlight possibilities for evolution. Attractors shed
light on the most likely and comfortable outcomes of the sys-
tem development under the influence of model factors.
The attractor is heuristically a very productive concept of
synergetics. Configuration of each specific trajectory may
depend on many fluctuations, but it does not eliminate the
final outcome and does not change the attractor's "location."
However, the system may have several attractors, and the
choice between them is made in a bifurcation point and may
be dependent on fluctuations. After passing a bifurcation
point, only a correction of the attractor-approaching trajec-
tory may take place within the system, not the choice of the
attractor itself; in the attractor the system stabilizes.
Discovering attractors allows us to effectively forecast the
future of the object of study, because eventually specific tra-
jectories (viz., any future scenarios) demonstrate a distinct
convergence to the attractor.
In many cases, the choice of the attractor depends heavily
on initial conditions, that is, the system's starting positions.
Every attractor corresponds to a certain area of initial states/
points, starting from which a system (if it "depends on initial
conditions") will definitely come to this attractor. As a meta-
phor for such phenomena, we can use a river's basin.
Quite often the images of basins and, less frequently, those of
attractors, generated in the way mentioned above, are fractals.
The quadratic model simulates the effect of a factor on
itself. This allows consideration of the presence of feedback
loops in the system. It is known that the presence of such
loops is a necessary condition for the model to demonstrate
some nonlinear effects. This is well illustrated in the agent-
based (Schelling, 2006) and system-dynamic (Meadows,
2008) modeling. Therefore, if we want to teach the model to
simulate nonlinear effects, the most direct way to do this is to
put into the model one or more feedback loops.
However, there are more fundamental considerations
forcing us to use the quadratic model to simulate the devel-
opment of social systems in particular. Among other things,
the system dynamics depends on its properties. A key feature
of any social system is reflexivity. Self-reflection, reflection
of its own state, is the attribute of the individual conscious-
ness as well as collective social phenomena. Our individual
and group ideas and behavioral strategies are under the direct
and strong influence of reflection on our current and past
states. Reflexivity is realized in a vast number of feedback
loops in society and, of course, in our minds. Reflexivity
requires considering the social system as a control factor for
the reconstruction of the social-system dynamics. The easiest
way to do this is to use the quadratic model.
According to the models' conditions, different areas of the
phase space may have a qualitative meaning. In GFMT, a sys-
tem is regarded in the context of transition from one ideal state
(zero pole) to another (infinity pole). As applied to real sys-
tems, in most cases this transition starts, continues, and finishes
somewhere between these two poles (see Figure 1). An image
point in the considered plate may be represented as a certain
qualitative state of the system that emerged from a combination
of particular values of two key system characteristics--H
x
and
H
y
. The conventional border of the GFMT working space is a
Zhukov and Lyamin 5
square (Figure 4). Each of the two characteristics (generally
speaking) has two gradations: weak (from 0 to 1, from 0 to -1)
and strong (from 1 to 2, from -1 to -2). These gradations may
be treated as two essentially (qualitatively) different ranges of
the respective characteristics. The combination of two grada-
tions of two characteristics provides four types of system states,
conditionally designated as , , ,  ()--Figure 4.
Modernofractal 5.1 generates images of attractors and
basins (fractal ones, as a rule) of the studied system depend-
ing on governing factors--Figure 5.
The user sets values of , d
c
, and k
c
(i.e., force of governing
factors) as constants; the user also pinpoints the direction of
how d
c
and k
c
factors influence the system (this may be inward
or outward directed--to the zero point or to the periphery, at
infinity). In compliance with the preset mesh step, the program
tests a set of complex plane points in the TOMH area or in any
other area that is defined by the user at random. Coordinates of
each tested point are carried to the iterated formula as a Z
1
initial value. Furthermore, the program performs a number of
iterations, defined by the user, and analyzes the final outcome.
Generally, 300 to 400 iterations are sufficient to establish
whether a generated numerical sequence ends at infinity or
tends to a certain attractor in some space (in the TOMH area).
-symmetry rule enforces that in each iteration, signs
before d
c
and k
c
are marked not depending on signs obtained
in the previous iteration, but depending on the user's settings
and signs before parts of the complex number F (d
f
; k
f
) in the
current iteration (Table 1).
F AZn
= 2. (2)
A-symmetry rule simulates the use in calculations of the
equal amount of negative and positive A-values taken in ran-
dom order, that lead to the distribution of attractors symmet-
rically about all axes. This rule may be applied by the user if
there is a qualitative sense of A irrespective of a sign.
Due to A- and C-symmetry rules, the imagery is symmet-
rical about the x- and y-axes. That is why a qualitative mean-
ing of imagery is enclosed in any one quarter of the working
space limited by semiaxes.
What Qualitative Senses Could Be
Correlated With GFMT Elements?
GFMT is designed for simulating and forecasting real social
processes. But the ability to simulate, as a minimum, sug-
gests certain qualitative senses of a model's procedures and
mathematical apparatus. How does transition (or nontransi-
tion) of the system from one state to another actually take
place in GFMT scenarios? Or, if we ask this question another
way--why does GFMT describe various transformations of
different systems with only one mathematical and logical
structure of representation? What are the common qualita-
tive senses for different systems that underlie the mathemati-
cal apparatus of the model?
A social system's transition from one state to another
occurs under the influence of the three multicomponent
factors: Zn
2 , system's self-development; A, system's envi-
ronmental resistance/irresistance; and C, impact of the
environment.
Any system tends to reproduce itself, to save itself, to
secure its identity as a minimum and strengthen its key char-
acteristics as a maximum, and so forth. Under the impact of
such inner intension for self-development, social structures
tend not to move rectilinearly and uniformly. And, it is the
operation of squaring a complex number Z
n
that definitely
reflects this attribute of social systems. First, inner factors of
the system's self-reproduction and self-protection may lead
the process of transition to empirically described "turbu-
lences" (rollbacks, jerks, slips, etc.)--multiple nonlinear
effects so common in real life. Second, the closer a system is
to "poles" (ideal states), the stronger its intention is to
strengthen key characteristics.
In GFMT, a user sets the full range of environmental
impacts on the system by means of two constants--parts of
the complex number  (d
c
; k
c
). They are two generalized
groups of "external impulses." Each of them is in effect pre-
dominantly along the respective axis, that is to say, each of
them makes an impact on one of the key characteristics. But
using complex numbers in calculations leads to paradoxical
outcomes. External influences may both encourage the
strengthening of a given characteristic as well as its weaken-
ing. That is the reason why a user is allowed not only to set a
d
c
and k
c
value ("force") but also for direction ("inward" or
"outward"). We can easily speculate on directions of external
factors' influence (as though we are in a one-dimensional
world) because we only deal with the theory of transition
from one state to another. And, it is the very paradigm of
transition studies that makes us establish a clear transition
direction--forward or backward (a third is not given).

The -factor is an inner factor of the system closely
related with the character of its interactions with the envi-
ronment. This factor weakens or strengthens the ability of
the system for self-development following its internal
logic. This factor makes the system more or less stable
toward the environment. To provide linearity of its impact,
the A-factor is introduced as a real number. As  (d
c
; k
c
),
the A-factor may be treated as a generalized combination of
factors.
Because complex numbers are used for building algebraic
fractals, questions arise: What is the "ontological" status of
complex numbers in social studies, and what kind of social
and political phenomena can be described by means of com-
plex numbers? Our proposal is to correlate real and imagi-
nary parts of a complex number with some binary notions a
system is characterized with. These may be contradictory or,
conversely, complementary notions. Discovering two basic
system characteristics, which are two parts of its dialectical
development, is quite a routine method for studying systems.
The GFMT-applied mathematical apparatus allows us to
simulate a system's behavior exactly as dynamics of a cor-
relation between two basic characteristics--H

and H

.
But why are there two characteristics? Why is correlation
between them crucial? Why may a system's trajectory/evolu-
tion in such coordinates be considered a tool to study differ-
ent (and sometimes quite dissimilar) social systems at all?
An application of a four-part marking-out of the phase space
in GFMT (Figure 4) is a widespread practice. It is heuristi-
cally productive, because the phase space marked out this
way may be considered a visualization of a two-dimensional
(based on two criteria) typology.
A good survey of this toolkit is presented by Russell
Ackoff's student and disciple, Jamshid Gharajedaghi (2006),
in System Thinking: Managing Chaos and Complexity.
Gharajedaghi suggests taking several system characteristics
in aggregate, moreover, in inseparable aggregate:
The principle of multidimensionality maintains that the opposing
tendencies not only coexist and interact, but also form a
complementary relationship. (Gharajedaghi, 2006, p. 39)
Technologically it is easier to work with the two-phase
space, where each characteristic is represented by a single
dimension. In this dimension, each characteristic may be
"strong" or "weak" (or, for example, "low" or "high"). This
procedure allows us (in a first, rough approximation) to dis-
tinguish four types of systems (or their states):
[This results] in a multidimensional scheme where a low/low
and a high/high, in addition to low/high and high/low, are strong
possibilities. This is a non-zero-sum formulation, in which a loss

for one side is not necessarily a gain for the other. On the
contrary, both opposing tendencies can increase or decrease
simultaneously. Using a multidimensional representation, one
can see how the tendencies previously considered as dichotomies
can interact and be integrated into something quite new. [ . . . ]
In this context, the point of distinction between low and high is
not arbitrary. It signifies the level at which the behavior of the
dependent system is qualitatively affected. (Gharajedaghi, 2006,
pp. 39-41)
A point mentioned by Gharajedaghi (2006) is the so-called
"unit line" in GFMT (Figure 4, red line), that may be consid-
ered as a border between two (along each axis) qualitatively
different values of a respective characteristic. Such a feature
of the unit line is determined by the very point of GFMT,
intended to trace qualitative transitions in the process of sys-
tem evolution. As an example, here we demonstrate markings
used in our two recent research projects for studying demo-
graphic strategies and interactions of traditional (pre-indus-
trial) society with the environment (Figures 6 and 7).
In a GFMT space marked "by default," other various
additional geometric constructions may be added--for
example, a homeostasis line along which basic system
parameters are balanced, and so forth. This makes the model
heuristically productive, because the image point moves (the
system evolves) through space endowed with a number of
complex qualitative meanings. There are known cases when
methods of studying system trajectories in the phase space
were successfully applied in researching not only physical
but also social phenomena. But how are these trajectories
generated? We suppose that procedures of algebraic fractal
build-up allow simulation of various social evolutions,
mainly their initial and end points.
As we found, GFMT may be applied for simulation of a
broad range of social phenomena with typical phase
transitions, a disproportion of causes and consequences, and
other counter-intuitive effects classic linear models cannot
grasp. Of course, it matters whether the development of these
phenomena may be simulated by formula (1) iteration. This
operation simulates interaction of several governing factors,
and moreover, these factors in their abstract formulation may
be considered to be the most significant for many social sys-
tems. This fact, as well as the simplicity of the formula cou-
pled with the great variety and complexity of results it
produces, makes the model completely functional. GFMT
may be "tuned," made more specific for studying different
objects. To do so, one should just redefine the characteristics,
the governing factors, and make a new phase space marking.
What Phenomena Can We Observe
in GFMT and How Can We Interpret
Them?
Any model results should be, as a minimum, interpretable.
The qualitative interpretation of images produced by GFMT
depends on both the character of these images and the state-
ment of initial conditions: Exactly what kind of physical
(qualitative) meanings are attributed to the basic characteris-
tics and governing factors of the model, and how different
areas of TOMH working space are marked. Methods of qual-
itative interpretation of the resulting images are based on an
analysis of the image point's movement through "marked"
phase space, with different areas and additional construc-
tions within the latter having their respective physical
meanings.
In GFMT, main objects and events of the chaos theory are
generated. We shall consider possible interpretations of sev-
eral (by no means all) events in the GFMT space without
reference to a specific subject.

If the simulating process has an attractor in visible range
and not in eternity, the point trajectory, as a rule, has a shape
of an intertwined spiral. Such a trajectory signifies damped
oscillation processes. It has a profound meaning with regard
to social and political systems, because such mechanisms
are instruments to achieve homeostasis and, besides, are
often a part of open "reactive" systems, developing in a
series of calls and responses (and counter-responses) to
them. Homeostasis maintenance suggests not only the freez-
ing of certain system parameters (in such a case it would
lose its ability to respond to external calls, that is, its adapta-
tion potential disappearing). In practice, homeostasis main-
tenance means several oscillations around system optima.
These oscillations allow the system to find, by trial and
error, the best parameters. In this case, homeostasis is not a
product of the processes' stopping, but an outcome of the
dynamic balance of multidirectional processes. The latter
creates significant advantages if the system comes out of the
homeostatic condition under the influence of external
impulses, because it leaves possibilities for system
self-development.
Another most important event in the model is a dispropor-
tion of causes and consequences. A minor change of one fac-
tor may cause a qualitative adjustment of attractors' and
basins' outlines. Of course, these macro-consequences of
micro-causes are not always possible, only under a certain
combination of factors. A reverse situation may also occur:
In some cases, major changes of governing factors have few
or no effect on outcomes.
In GFMT, a phase transition occurs as an "explosion of
attractors." For illustrative purposes, we present images from
a series of experiments carried out for a research project on
demographic strategies of traditional society (Figure 8;
Zhukov et al., 2013a). Initially concentrated in one point,
attractors fly apart to form several groups--they "explode"
and leave a "shell." After the first "explosion," one can see a
new "secondary" system stabilization, when attractors,
though not in one point as before, nevertheless form a com-
pact cloud. This means that separate social communities
retain a certain degree of "social fate" commonality and
evolve together in some way. However, if governing factors
keep on changing in a definite way, the second "explosion"
happens, and so forth. Eventually, a series of "explosions"
leads to a slide toward true chaos (attractors and basins dis-
appear from the working area).
Only within the last two decades has the idea of phase
transitions being extremely widespread in history been estab-
lished in social sciences. Overnight "loyal advocates" can
turn into "blood-thirsty Jacobins," "monarch-loving peas-
ants" into "regicides," and "communist leaders" into "bank-
ers." An inexperienced observer may conclude that all these
social and political metamorphoses are so radical and fast
moving that they are undoubtedly caused by supernatural
forces or inspired by influence agents from abroad. That is
wrong. Phase transitions are quite common phenomena even
in daily life.
Diversification, distinction, and sophistication of differ-
ent attractors'basin contours may be interpreted as increased
varieties of the system's ways of development, the emer-
gence of situations of social choice. Such a diversification
generates complementarity of social elements in the first
instance, and then a collapse, if it deepens pathologically. On
the threshold of chaos--after a second or third "explosion"--
even a very insignificant change in initial conditions can

marking.
Note. GFMT = General Fractal Model of Transit.

trigger the attractor's change. In real life, this means that
every decision becomes crucial for further development.
Attractors do not just deconsolidate and diffuse, but "fly
apart" to typologically distinct areas of the phase space. In
such a situation, a coexistence of institutions with markedly
different prospects takes place. System development is
poorly predicted in this case. A community cannot exist fol-
lowing this pattern for long.
"Explosions" are accompanied by a narrowing of the
"space of survival" (sum of all attractors), because in this
case, a system sometimes cannot get into an attractor lying
within a physically possible range. In other words, condi-
tions emerge that push a system into infinity. After each
"explosion of attractors," the visible attractors keep on exist-
ing within an even narrower range of governing factors.
This is quite typical for understanding the modernization
common for historical and political science studies, where it
supposes acceleration of development rates, an increase in
catastrophe risks, and an essential expansion of possible
prospects. We assume that all modernized contemporary
societies may be considered as ones of "secondary stability."
Homeostasis of a modernized society is based on the balance
of fast processes and the balance of strong factors. Such bal-
ances need to be fine-tuned and are more sensitive to minor
alterations in environmental conditions. Modernization insti-
tutions are solid within a narrow range of governing factors,
because they are more fragile. On the contrary, traditional
society is based on slow processes and maintains homeosta-
sis due to the conservation of processes and the reduction of
factors.
How Can Models of Particular Social
Systems Be Created on the Basis of
GFMT and How Can One Experiment
With These Models?
We would like to demonstrate the GFMT heuristic potential
in research practice, namely, in studies of social and political
institutions' modernization. We can create a model of the
particular object--rapid institutional modernization--on the
basis of the abstract GFMT. We call it "Modernofractal." But
first of all, we should formulate the initial conditions by
describing the research situation.
It is known that spontaneous (natural, organic) modern-
ization is now impossible--it is consigned to history. Possible
formats for modernization are partial (in post-colonial coun-
tries) or rapid (in countries of catching-up development or, in
other words, "of second echelon," e.g., BRICS--Brazil,
Russia, India, China, South Africa). We are concerned with
forced modernization--a process enhanced and accelerated
by impulses from a certain interior modernization driver.
Institutions are the key phenomenon in many social theo-
ries. Douglas North, an institutionalism theoretician, under-
stood institutions, among other things, as a body of rules for
human conduct ("game rules"; North, 1990). Institutions may
be formal and informal, modernized and traditional.
Modernization must be accompanied by the growing formal-
ization of rules and mechanisms of social and political inter-
action. The reverse process, deformalization of rules, is
generally a social malady in reality (Merkel & Croissant,
2000). The term "traditional informal institution" is applied to
Figure 8. "Explosion of attractors," example.

the enormous number of phenomena, which are mostly highly
negative--personal ties networks and corruption, clientelism,
paternalism, clans and mafia, nepotism, and so forth (Helmke
& Levitsky, 2004). It is known that in the process of rapid
modernization TIIs continue to exist for various reasons, as a
rule, related to the high speed of modernization transforma-
tions. We shall focus our attention primarily on the correlation
and interaction between TIIs and modernized formal ones
(such as public law and the State administration).
By means of Modernofractal we carried out 19 series of
experiments. Here, we could imagine (very generally) the
final results.
To formalize initial data, we used indicators calculated
on the basis of expert evaluations. Therefore, in this study,
modeling should be considered solely as a means to produce
hypotheses, to create a number of possible prospects. It was
important for us, because along with historical content, the
"Modernofractal" project incorporated a political research
component. Within this component, the issues we addressed
were an analysis of alternative scenarios and a forecasting of
certain outcomes of various hypothetical controlling actions.
We used data on Russia, but at a high level of abstraction,
Russian processes are very similar to those in other coun-
tries of catching-up development.
In Modernofractal, standard scaling and calibration meth-
ods were applied. A model was verified by comparing the
outcomes of computer experiments with values of governing
factors and the final results of the studied processes known
from historical sources and academic literature.
Modernofractal phase space marking for simulating insti-
tutional dynamics is a remarkably modified typology of
institutions, offered by Helmke and Levitsky (2004; Table 2,
Figures 9 and 10). The essence of this modification is an
assumption that ineffectiveness of formal institutions
increases in a direct ratio to the distinction in prominent
characteristics between formal and informal institutions in a
peculiar social milieu.
We offer the following meanings for governing factors: Z2
is an intention of the system (institution) for self-develop-
ment. Impulse  (d
c
; k
c
) signifies external impact on the sys-
tem: d
c
--modernizing or traditionalizing activity of the State
as a key creator and reformer of institutions; k
c
--the degree a
system is influenced by public consciousness (a sum of atti-
tudes and active stands aimed to maintain the system in its
present form and/or its transformation toward modernization
or traditionalization). The -factor designates objective
modernization/traditionalistic demands and opportunities
inherent in the institution's social milieu.
Essentially, the process of simulation modeling in GFMT
consists of three stages: formalization of sociohumanitarian
(politological in this case) discourse, imaging of attractors
and basins in the fractal builder, and interpretation of graphic
and numerical results in sociohumanitarian qualitative terms,
and comparison of these interpretations with known facts.
Lacking the possibility to present all the experiments carried
out in the "Modernofractal" project, we mention (very briefly) a
number of experiments from "00 series." Here, we focus not on
their substantial outcomes, but on the methods of their obtaining
and on demonstration of outcome data interpretability.
What are incoming data of a "zero" simulating situation?
First, there is strong modernization pressure from the State
(d
c
) upon a certain hypothetical institution (or a number of
institutions). Second, a public consciousness attitude (k
c
)
toward transformation of the institute is not clearly expressed
and may change significantly. Recent historical experience
shows that whereas some social strata have high moderniza-
tion expectations, the dominance of traditionalist thinking is
evident among enormous masses of the population not will-
ing to adapt to the innovations associated with moderniza-
tion. After all, these innovations often bring (as side effects)
the necessity to master new formal practices, gain more
modern knowledge of law and economics, and give up social
parasitism in favor of social activism.
Third, values of modernization opportunities and social
milieu demands (A-factor) used in the "zero" series may
seem low at first sight (0.2-0.3 points on a scale 0-2). In the
simplest case, it could mean, for example, that moderniza-
tion supporters represent 10% to 15% of the social milieu of
this institute. This is a not small number.
Let us consider the outcome of experiment 00_001
(Figure 11). Attractors are far from the convergence line and
close to the competitive institutions area and to the pole of
the State ineffectiveness. Generally speaking, this situation
may be interpreted as an accentuation of an etatist and direc-
tive character of modernization. This is a situation where
institutions of accommodating type are substituted by those
of a competitive type. It leads to the decline of the State
effectiveness and to the open confrontation of formal and
informal institutions.

Zhukov and Lyamin 11
In many other experiments, the presence of moderniza-
tion pressing as a major factor of institutional development is
almost always necessary for the implementation of desirable
scenarios. In the meantime, if the State efforts for modern-
ization are the only driver of this process, they are canceled
out by the counter-intuitive behavior of the social system.
Experiment 00_012 (Figure 12) is a good demonstration
of a scenario where modernization efforts of the State are
supported by the public consciousness. The outcome is pos-
itive: Attractors are steadily located in modernization areas
near the convergence line. This observation is easily inter-
preted by itself. If some level of modernization of public
consciousness does not exist, external modernization
impact throws the actors out "in a vacuum": The old insti-
tutional structure is deteriorated but not substituted with a
new one.
Experiment 00_013 (Figure 13) demonstrates a sce-
nario where modernization opportunities dominate (high
A-factor) and the State impact is traditionalistic. This is
quite an artificial situation hardly imaginable in real con-
temporary life, but of course, history knows such examples.
At each level, we see a deeply dissected, polarized society
where every unit has development prospects distinct from
those of the next unit and, in its turn, consists of different-
type parts.
What Are the Results of the
Institutional Modernization Simulation?
We present some most interesting qualitative interpretations from
the series of experiments. Generally, nonlinear effects known
from literature were verified (under a certain combination of

factors), and new effects and/or conditions of their origin were
discovered. We used a metaphor "turbulent" rapid modernization
to describe the whole complex of these effects.
Such a modernization is not uniform, it variously affects dif-
ferent institutions, strata, and spaces that should seem to lead to
contradictions or even clashes between them. The turbulent

modernization is characterized with phase transitions--leaps,
"breakthroughs"--that may break the proportion of causes and
consequences. Leonid Borodkin (2005), a Russian specialist in
social-system modeling, notes
According to the [synergetic] paradigm, development is thought
of as a sequence of long periods of the stable states of the system,
interrupted by short periods of chaotic behavior, after which a
transition to the next stable state (attractor) takes place. (p. 5)
In terms of institutionalism, a phase transition may be
described as follows: In the beginning, an institutional struc-
ture exists (game rules) with informal institutions inside it.
There is also consensus among actors regarding this structure,
as well as some kind of equilibrium (this implies, among other
matters, a balance between actors' advantages from the exist-
ing structure and disadvantages from its collapse). At the same
time, a latent institutional structure exists (alternative, known-
but-not-used game rules) that does not include TIIs. But transi-
tion to the new game rules, even though old ones are archaic
and ineffective, faces at least two obstacles. First, actors are
afraid to incur unacceptable costs as a result of abandoning the
previous equilibrium. Second, scattered attractors do not pos-
sess the instruments to compromise on removing old game
rules and accepting new ones. In many cases, tackling of these
two obstacles does not need considerable resource spending
(namely, it has a low-energy, "weak" impact on the system),
but it may have far-reaching implications.
During modernization, archaic norms, social structures,
and administrative and political institutions do not die off,
but adapt, accustom into new ones, both transforming mod-
ernization innovations and being transformed by them. This
is how "the sedimentary society"2 emerges, where old "game
rules" are conserved but not isolated. A sedimentary structure
(or traditional institutional legacy), having lost its former
functional role, obtains pathological forms. "Communal con-
sciousness" justifies criminal clans. "Mutual supportiveness"
gives rise to "mutual cover-up," conspiracies of silence, and
illegal relations between the State officials and the business
community. "Patriarchalism" creates nepotism, domestic
violence, and so forth. This is how an effect that may be
called a "ptomaine of traditionalism" emerges.
"Backflows" are inherent in turbulent modernization. In
some areas and institutions, which are not fully integrated
into modernization processes, there is an emergence of a kind
of cyst that evolves in the opposite direction--toward archa-
ism. Under a number of favorable (nondiscriminatory) con-
ditions, these sectors grow intensively. The appearance of
pseudo-morphoses allows archaic institutions to be steadily
embedded into modernized formal structures and substitute
modernized "game rules" (the essence of institutions) while
preserving exterior forms. Archaic institutions seek to adapt
to a new modernized milieu in a way that is inherent to
human beings and not plants: If the latter change themselves,
the former change the environment. For example, in response
to the primacy of personal ties, openness to violence, formal
and legal nihilism in traditional societies, modernized struc-
tures have to adjust to them and obtain their features. These
phenomena alone are widely known and constitute one of the
most debated topics in social sciences.
Even if "backflows" occupy quite a small social space,
nevertheless, the very presence of them drastically enhances
the unforeseen negative effects of the modernization strategy.
In many cases, the collapse of traditionalist segments pro-
ceeds quite painfully: Both in experiments and reality, we see
that such efforts may result in the disintegration of the insti-
tutional structure, and the abrupt narrowing of the system's
space of survival. But the "flawed stability" scenario is very
14 SAGE Open
dangerous as well. It implies the dislocation of attractors to
the area of competitive institutions and to the pole of the
State ineffectiveness; it may even cause an open struggle
between institutions of different types. While placing mod-
ernization demands on institutions, the State in the meantime
makes concessions to the traditional social forces in exchange
for stability. Such dissonant behavior leads to the sheer falsi-
fication of institutions: Behind the exterior formally modern-
ized façade, informal archaic institutions--mafia-clannish,
senior-vassal, tribal, and so forth--are developing.
A series of experiments also makes evident the effect of
"necrosis": In the process of modernization, a number of
institutions are neither modernized nor traditionalized, nei-
ther adapt nor isolate themselves, they just disappear in the
social and, consequently, physical sense. It is interesting that
in our experiments "necrosis" started in the poles of diver-
gence, where formal game rules were too weak and gave
place to almighty informal institutions. These are spaces
where society/state public authority ends and the supremacy
of tribal and ethnic factions, criminal gangs, or quasi-capital-
ist corporations starts. One can see this effect as a humanitar-
ian catastrophe, an accumulation of socially dangerous
groups or "inflammable material," and so forth.
Modernization pressure may be accompanied with the
growth of "volatility" and variability of modernization mea-
sures (and likewise, reactions to them): Some of them may be
stronger and super strong, others less strong and insignifi-
cant. Historians are familiar with the "frog effect," an inter-
change of institutions' and societies' super-passivity with
leap-ahead super-reactions to sometimes minor external
impulses. Besides, the institution's fragility grows signifi-
cantly against the background of rapid modernization.
Conclusion
Following natural and hard sciences, social disciplines mas-
ter methods and concepts of fractal geometry. Large-scale
invariability, system's ability to self-assembling, complex
consequences of simple causes, fractal limits--these and
many other phenomena are hard to describe and generalize
within traditional models of social processes. Meanwhile,
political scientists, historians, and sociologists often deal
with these phenomena. The ability of virtual computer frac-
tals to simulate real objects and processes in living and non-
living worlds makes fractal geometry a heuristically
productive instrument not only for modeling physical but
also for social reality.
