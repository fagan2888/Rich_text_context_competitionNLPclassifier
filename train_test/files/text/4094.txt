Introduction
InhisPhilosophiaeNaturalesPrincipiaMathematica,I.Newton
(1965) explains how we should consider time, space, and place.
He defines absolute time as a mathematical truth: It has no
relationship with anything external, and it corresponds to
length. Among its distinctive characteristics, there is the
fact that it flows steadily and that it corresponds also to
length. In this, we can distinguish it from relative time,
defined as "apparent" and "vulgar" because it is only a mea-
surement of absolute time. Space considered in an absolute
sense, the physicist tells us, is by nature void of relations with
external elements. For this reason, it is always the same and
remains still. When, instead, we refer to relative space, it is
necessary to consider it as a moving dimension or as a mea-
surement of absolute space that our senses define according
to its position with the surrounding bodies. A place is the part
of space occupied by a body, and with reference to space, it
can be absolute or relative (1965). It is a linear conception of
time--the one proposed by Newton--that will later on be
criticized by A. Einstein with his equation of relativity.
Yet the concepts of time and space described by Newton
suit the cultural and experiential dimension outlined by
M. McLuhan (1962) in his description of phonetic and visual
culture--an analysis, which moving from the introduction of
the alphabet, brings us to Gutenberg and to the electronic
media. It is only at the end of the 19th century that the tele-
phone became a habit for the inhabitants of the Western
world. Before then, there had never been the need to assign
the codification or the decodification of a message to any
kind of media. The necessary competences to perform this
function were, in fact, already innate in the sender and the
receiver of the message: in man. Language, the mastery of
the alphabet, and, of course, hearing and sight are things that
man possesses. Man crystallizes as a medium of the things that
are communicated through him. With the spreading of electri-
cal media, among which McLuhan considers also automation,
man can expand his senses, overcoming the barriers of face-
to-face communication. The communication process expands
over time and space: It goes beyond the physical place. There
is the possibility to communicate at a distance with different
times of emission and reception. Relying once again on the
great scholars of the past, but without abusing their knowl-
edge, we can establish a parallelism between the new percep-
tion of time and space offered to us by the Web and what
Einstein says with his equation of relativity. Moving from
the consideration that if the time of the perception of all
objects was instantaneous, then the speed of light would be
infinite, Einstein starts confuting the idea of linear time. In

From the Alphabet to the Web:
HowTime, Space, andThought
Have Changed

Abstract
The article discusses the issues of social and cultural construction of the concepts of time, space, and thought.This analysis
is matched by a parallel between the physics and those of communication.To be used as a reference is the shift from the
Newtonian conception of time and space to the one proposed by Einstein. In fact, the concepts of space and time outlined in
Newtonian physics well befits to what is the cultural and experiential that outlines M. McLuhan in his description of the aural
and visual culture--an examination that,starting from the introduction of the alphabet,takes us to Gutenberg and the electric
media.The revolution introduced by Einstein seems similar to the one that goes to the concepts of time, space, and thought
with the advent of the Net.This article includes a review of the literature on the subject, through the lesson of Meyrowitz,
McLuhan, Innis, Castells,Appadurai, Manovich, Berners-Lee to get to Carr. Facing this path is referred to as the birth of the
hypertext moment of transition from linear thinking to the reticular.

fact, Einstein says that this is not true--the speed of light is
not infinite--and in declaring this, he was able to count on
the studies carried out in those years on this issue. The speed
of light is high, but it is not infinite, and it corresponds to
around 300,000 km per second. The consequence of this
enunciation is that nothing can be measured as fast as light.
Einstein imagined riding the light that carries the informa-
tion about movement, and he therefore understood that it
was necessary to change the dimensions of time and space
when the events are being observed. In Einstein's opinion,
space and time are not distinct absolute quantities as Newton
had presupposed. They are instead intrinsically relative, so
that space cannot absolutely be distinguished from time; it is
the interaction between energy and matter that determines
variable dimensions of time and space in the universe. These
words recall those of J. Meyrowitz (1985), according to
whom the influence of mass media is not so much in the
vehiculated content but in their ability to create social situa-
tions where interactions can take place, transforming com-
municative models and favoring social change. The idea of
time and space used by the Web picks up the one outlined by
Einstein, and it could incur in the same paradoxes. For exam-
ple, when we talk about communication via the Internet, we
indicate it as simultaneous, but is it really so? How much
time passes from the emission of the message and its recep-
tion? Can we "really" consider it simultaneous? Certainly
not. What we can here point out is that we pass from the
linear time typical of the alphabet to a dimension of time and
space connected to each other and capable of drawing a net
of relations and "places."
The systems of communication have changed, change,
and will probably continue to change our perception of prox-
imity. What was once perceived as distant is now part of our
space of experience, that is, of that place where everything
appears to be simultaneous. Information travels across the
Web in simultaneous time. The Medium Theory (Meyrowitz,
1994) considers media as "environments" in which interac-
tions between individuals occur, contributing to the creation
of "technologically structured communities." This distances
us from the idea that the means of communication are pas-
sive containers inside which information moves. The exam-
ples in favor of this statement are numerous and are connected
to the very introduction of a "new technology" (Paccagnella,
2000). According to McLuhan (1962) and Eisenstein (1983),
the invention of print had consequences on the general struc-
ture of society; satellites, radars, and, more in general, the
new communication technologies have changed military
strategies and tactics (De Landa, 1991). If we normally attri-
bute to the invention of print and of movable type the pas-
sage from traditional to modern society, Marvin (1988)
makes the attempt to position that moment toward the end of
the 19th century, when the communicative potential of the
telephone, the telegraph, and the light bulb was discovered.
With the development of the Internet, and with the increas-
ing pervasiveness of communication between networked
computers, we are in the middle of the most transforming
technologicaleventsincethecaptureoffire(Haythornthwaite
& Wellman, 2002).
In recent years, the spreading of the Internet has changed
and widened the modalities, the space, and the time of com-
munication, work, and structure of thought. Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT) have become so perva-
sive that the situational geography of social life has changed
(Meyrowitz, 1985), projecting in the telematic sphere (Picci,
1999) new forms of interaction.
Time and space, considered as social constructs, undergo
construction and deconstruction processes linked to the tech-
nologies and the "cultures" (phonetic, visual), which are
introduced from time to time.
Time From the Alphabet to the Web
Time in Linear Communication
In The Gutenberg Galaxy, McLuhan (1962) affirms that the
interiorization of the phonetic alphabet transports man from
the magical world of hearing to the neutral world of sight.
With the introduction of technological innovations, there is
a substantial change in the vision of the world of a European
or American boy in comparison with that proper of an
African one. In an example offered by McLuhan, the tech-
nology surrounding boys coming from the Western world is
essentially described as visual, abstract, and explicit, where
things occur in times and spaces that are continuous, uni-
form, and in linear succession. On the contrary, African boys
live in an implicit and magical world of resonant words
(McLuhan, 1962). To strengthen this analysis, McLuhan
quotes a research by J. C. Carothers, which appeared in the
journal Psychiatry in November 1959. This author asks in
what way teaching how to read and write can determine in
society the passage from the idea of words as a living and
resonant strength to that of a simple mental meaning. In his
studies, Carothers compares illiterate and literate aboriginals
and then, more generically, illiterates and Western world
men. His observations push him to conclude that Western
world men move from a reality where sounds are dynamic
and external objects to another reality where, because of the
existence of writing, they lose these characteristics and are
subject to sight. The Western world man, affirms therefore
Carothers, "mainly relies on the structuring of time-space
relationships without which it is impossible to obtain the
mechanical sense of casual relationships necessary to give
an order to our experiences" (McLuhan, 1962, p. 44). This is
the direct consequence of writing: In fact, as soon as words
are colored with ink, they become part of the visual world,
and they abandon the hearing one. This is also the opinion of
W. J. Ong (1982), when he stresses the change in the rela-
tionship between space and discourse with reference to the
press. The use of different media to communicate produces
its consequences in the experiential world of man, who ends
La Rocca 3
up therefore changing his way of perceiving time and space.
The relationship between culture and technology is a theme
that McLuhan and the School of Toronto are fond of. H. Innis
(1952) in The Bias of Communication had indicated that writ-
ing systems develop as a means capable of coordinating and
controlling human activities with reference to a greater
extension of time and space. The same author in a previous
book titled Empire and Communication (Innis, 1950) had
already highlighted how a fundamental distinction to be
made in terms of communication is the one that separates
oral from written cultures, pointing out that whereas Greek
civilization had been kept together by an oral culture, Roman
civilization had been based on a written one. The conse-
quences of the introduction of the alphabet were put forward
again by McLuhan, who defined the literate as a "divided"
and "schizophrenic" man. Such schizophrenia was attributed
to the phonetic alphabet with its "abstraction of a meaning
from sound and the translation of sound in a visual code." It
forces, in fact, man to face an experience that transforms him
(McLuhan, 1962, p. 47). According to McLuhan, the pho-
netic alphabet has the capability of liberating man from the
tribe because he is taken away from the tight net of interac-
tions of the hearing system. Man abandons or rather "comes
out of" those simultaneous relationships typical of acoustic
and oral spaces, and he finds himself in the world of the
alphabet. Here, he lives a moment of dualistic schizophre-
nia, due to the dilatation or externalization of one sense or
another. Yet, when technology extends one of our senses, a
new cultural translation takes place at the same speed with
which the new technology is internalized. The coming of the
Internet Galaxy (Castells, 2001) produces a fusion between
hearing and sight. If the introduction of a new technology
determines a dilatation and an intertwining of our senses and
if this has already been discovered by McLuhan in the pas-
sage from the magical world of sounds to the alphabet, in
other words from a hearing system to a visual linear time one,
how can we explain multisequentiality? How can we insert
in an interpretative dimension the question put forward by
N. Carr (2010): "Does the Internet make us stupid? Or does
it only make us once again schizophrenic?"
TimelessTime
It is in The Rise of Network Society that Castells (1996)
identifies in simultaneity and timelessness the characteris-
tics of time in our society. This is a consequence of com-
puter-mediated communication that makes it possible to talk
in real time with chat and interactive systems. The conse-
quences of this system of communication can be traced in
the predominant cultural system.
The reorganization of media time within the same
channel of communication and with the free choice of
the spectator/actor, creates a temporal collage in which
only genres are mixed together, while time becomes
synchronic over a flat horizon, without a beginning, an
end, a sequence. (Castells, 1996, p. 526; Italian trans-
lation, 2000)
Timelessness--Castells (1996) adds--is a trait of our cul-
ture deriving from the structure of the multimedia hypertext.
Also for him, this way of finding and structuring information
"shapes the minds and memories of the children educated in
the new cultural context" (p. 526). Time events and, more in
general, history are organized in sequences, in extractable
freeze-frames so that a visual culture prevails. The author
reminds us how encyclopedias organized knowledge in
alphabetical order. At present, instead, the means of commu-
nication organize the access to information according to the
needs of producers and consumers. Proceeding this way, the
events lack chronological order and what we obtain is a cul-
ture of the eternal and of the ephemeral. The predominant
culture is eternal because it is able to move forward and
backward along the entire sequence of cultural expressions.
It is ephemeral because it changes, bends, and takes the
shape demanded by the context it finds itself in. In this case,
the main change is the disappearance of linear sequentiality.
It is in this sense that we have to interpret the passage from a
linear alphabetic culture linked to the flow of letters that
make words and to single events that make situations and
history to a culture based on the multisequentiality of images,
with a "timeless time," both eternal and discontinuous. The
perspective in which Castells moves is called informational-
ism. It is the idea of the Web as a world capable of guarantee-
ing the connection and the communication between users
geographically distant from one another and of becoming the
most important resource from the economical and political
point of view. Using the flows. The author can therefore
affirm that timeless time belongs to the space of flows,
because in the movement of the Web, the sequentiality of
events is altered.
Spaces, Places, and Social Situations
Beyond the Sense of a Place
The action is performed by an actor/element situated in a
space that makes it come to being in a time that goes from t0
to t1. This is how we could make explicit the sense of what
should be considered as an action and, consequently, as a
"situation" in linear time. It matches what Newton (1965)
enunciates in his Philosophiae Naturales Principia
Mathematica. Yet, as we have here already affirmed, this
conception falls to pieces as soon as we consider Einstein
and his theory of relativity. It falls to pieces also when we
consider the presence of the media. Milestone of this change
is Meyrowitz's (1985) No Sense of Place. The author, study-
ing in-depth the concepts of social interaction, of place, and
of scene and back-scene presented by E. Goffman (1959),
introduces us to the idea that "the nature of interaction is not
4 SAGE Open
determined by the physical environment as such, but by
informative model flows" (Meyrowitz, 1985, p. 60; Italian
translation, 1995). In fact, Meyrowitz argues that a place
such as a room has a social meaning because the walls and
the doors bring to the inclusion and the exclusion of the
participants, defining a space of action. Hence, it is the case
to ask oneself if "behavioral environments have to be neces-
sarily places. In other words, is the place really so important
for the behavior or is there something else, traditionally
associated to the place and for this reason confused with it?"
(Meyrowitz, 1985, p. 59; Italian translation, 1995). The
answer is the "informative flow," the knowledge, and the
interpretation of the action and of the social situation that
exists in a certain environment. The example proposed is
that of some waiters who move between the lounge, where
they serve the clients (the scene), and the kitchen (the back-
scene), where they get ready to serve the tables. But if the
lounge is empty because the restaurant is still closed, the
space of the "scene" can be used to perform "back-scene"
activities. Likewise, if a regular client goes beyond the
doors, which separate the lounge from the kitchen, also the
kitchen can become part of the scene. It is clear that what
changes when you are in a place is the different flow of
information that you possess according to the situation you
are in. The social situation is characterized by an "informa-
tive system," that is, by a certain model of access to informa-
tion concerning the behavior of other people. Considering
the situation as an informative system allows you to estab-
lish a continuum between a "face to face" situation and a
situation mediated by communication systems. Media mod-
ify the border between the scene and the back-scene, no
longer drawing it using a physical dimension, but with an
informative one instead. Think about when you receive a
call on your mobile and someone asks you, "Where are you?
Am I disturbing? Can we talk? Are you alone?" All these
questions are necessary to define the social situation. This
way you can sense if it is possible to ask certain kinds of
questions, how the interlocutor will filter his or her answers,
how much time he or she will be able to dedicate to the call
and the topics of discussions, and what else could attract his
or her attention. The introduction and the diffusion on a large
scale of new means of communication restructure many
social situations and require new social behaviors. But there is
a "dark side" to this declination in a large scale of situations
and also to the creation of landscapes in which you are
inserted.TheyaretackledbyA.Appadurai(1996)inModernity
at Large, where he defines ethnoscapes as "scapes of group
identities." He explains that this neologism contains a wanted
ambiguity. It refers first of all to the dilemmas of perspective
and representation all ethnographers have to face, and he
admits that (as for the landscapes of the visual arts) the tra-
ditional perceptions and perspectives, together with the
variations in the situations of the observer, can influence the
process and the result of the representation (Appadurai,
1996, p. 71; Italian translation, 2001). These ethnoscapes
have a fluid and irregular shape for they are the consequence
of global interactions, stretched between cultural homogeni-
zation and heterogenization. What Appadurai (1996) sug-
gests should be read as an acceptance of the consequences of
the exchange of information via the new technologies--in
other words, the acceptance that the exchanged flows of
information produce new scapes, such as the ethnoscapes,
the mediascapes, the technoscapes, the finanscapes, and the
ideoscapes. The mediascapes refer
both to the distribution of the electronic ability to pro-
duce and spread information (newspapers, magazines,
T.V. stations and motion picture production studios)
which are available to an increasing number of centers
of private and public interest all over the world, and to
the images of the world provided by these media.
(Appadurai, 1996, p. 55; Italian translation, 2001)
The main function of mediascapes is to offer stories and
images in which are mixed the worlds of goods, politics, and
news. The effect on the public or, better, on the users is to
reduce the distance between fictional and realistic worlds.
The negative consequence underlined by Appadurai (1996)
in this excess of symbolic media production is that the more
the public is distant from experiencing directly what is nar-
rated, the more it will build imaginary and chimeric worlds,
basing itself on what is produced by the media. And this will
be its reality.
The Space of Flows
In recent years, the diffusion of the Internet modified and
widened the way, the space, and the time of communication.
The space of flows (Castells, 1996) is known to be "a time
out of time and a space out of space," a web with more inclu-
sion and exclusion than in McLuhan's (1962) "global vil-
lage." The concept of an active space in the geographical
structure of the Web is not defined by the physical distance
between two points of the Web itself, but it must be con-
nected to the notion of "place" specifically of the Web.
Castells (1996) suggests that it is space to organize time and
not vice versa. He stresses the strength of the space of flows
toward the space of places, going beyond what is expressed
by Newton: A place is the part of space occupied by a body.
Here, the place can be an environment of communicative
vicinity and exchange. According to Castells, there are flows
of capital, information, technology, organizational interactions,
images, sounds, or symbols--everything that can "move"
from one node to another using the technological support.
Information being the predominant resource also from the
economic point of view, the flows become an expression of
the processes that control the economic, political, and sym-
bolic life. If in social theory, space is the material support
of the social practices of time sharing (Castells, 1996, p.
472; Italian translation, 2000), in information society, the
La Rocca 5
material support of the main processes will be the elements
that support the flows.
The space of flows is the material organization of the
social practices of time sharing which operate through
flows. By flows I intend sequences of exchange and of
targeted, repetitive and programmed interactions
between physically separated positions occupied by
social actors in the economical, political and symboli-
cal structures of society. (p. 473)
The places that make up the territories of the Web are
electronic mail, mailing lists, newsgroups, forums, Internet
real chats (IRC), Multi-User Dungeons (MUD) or Muds
Object Oriented (MOO), but also massively multiplayer
online role-playing games (MMORPG) and social network
sites. The connection of users thanks to these instruments of
communication creates forms of community relationships
that are different from the relational networks with weak and
hidden borders (Dell'Aquila, 1999) and in which prevails a
"hybrid" kind of language. Dell'Aquila emphasizes how the
birth of virtual communities takes place in the presence of a
common Lebenswelt (world of life) that pushes who is alone
to enter a community. This is little to do with Tönnies's
Gemeinschaft because it has the characteristics of a social
unity--more or less locally extended--where shared themes
are discussed (Giuliano, 1999). Mailing lists, newsgroups,
social networks, and chats become privileged places where it
is possible to monitor the development of the themes, of the
adopted modalities of communication, and of the tools them-
selves, considered as agorà and milieu innovative.
Principles and Consequences
of the Digital
The Digital Paradigm
The phonetic alphabet favors the linearity of language and
thought projecting us toward a linear time and space. The
digital paradigm characterized by the principles of nonse-
quentiality, of probability, and of variability (Manovich,
2001) brings us to the perception and the structuring of a
multidimensional space and thought. The three main princi-
ples of the digital paradigm provide us with a reading/
writing space that is different from that of the alphabet and
of visual culture. There is a step from a "mythical thought"
in which things have sense because they are brought back to
one and only one context to an "alphabetical thought" and at
last to "digital thought," which introduces us into an inter-
subjective context deriving from a new auditive and visual
culture to be found in a nonsequential textual dimension (de
Kerckhove, 2001). The nonsequentiality exists both in the
writing phase and in the text fruition phase on the Web. In
addition, the possibility to choose one connection instead of
another favors the indeterminacy of the structure of a
"story." All this pushes us to summarize the variability of the
narration typical of the new media as the sum of the relation-
ships that can be created between the objects (Guidolin,
2005; Manovich, 2001). Digital technology produces an
acceleration in the relationship between culture and com-
munication, offering new perspectives to the art of writing,
the structure of texts, and the perception of events. The new
communicative modalities have a lot in common with oral
communication. Although this belongs to the past, we can
now paradoxically find some of its modalities in technologi-
cal settings: the immersion of the reader/user in the context,
his or her ability to be "trained" by it and to interact with the
text by changing it, and his or her willingness to accept new
experiences.
Hypertexts as articulations. Hypertexts derive from numer-
ous literary, philosophical, and technological influences,
which may seem unconnected, but which have in reality col-
laborated to the realization of a new software system linked
to a conceptual and psychological environment: virtuality
(La Rocca, 2006). The oxymorons--Derrida, the hyper-
textual, and Nelson, the poststructuralist--were coined by
Landow (1994) to indicate how two disciplines, philosophy
and computer science, apparently so distant from one
another, can have in some way worked together to create a
digital-conceptual structure capable of originating a nonse-
quential way of writing and an active way of reading. Two
cultures face the future of writing, two approaches give
hypertexts a structure: The labyrinth is not only a net of links
but also a mythological image. T. Nelson (1990) notes how
technological culture and humanistic culture have not estab-
lished any form of dialogue on common themes. Technolo-
gists are interested in the rational logic of their proceedings,
and they condemn the humanists who usually discuss the
problems and themes considered idealistically.
For the Humanists the World is history, art, literature
and the little corner is occupied by "technical things".
For the technologists the World are the great ideas
and the Technical Issues, while the little corner is
occupied by old-fashioned things of a pre-technolog-
ical past. (Nelson, 1990, 1/13; Italian translation,
1992)
Obviously, Nelson has a different opinion. He believes
that both parties live in a "little corner" and because of their
closed mentalities, they both do not understand that the
objectives of the editorial systems of the future are those of
civilization itself and that technological tools are necessary
for these objectives to be reached. "System Humanists" are
in Nelson's opinion those who believe in this possible union.
The conceptual link, identified later by Nelson and Derrida, is
the Eldorado of the System Humanists. Derrida is a post-
structuralist philosopher born in 1930; The affinity with the
systems of hypertext writing can be found in some works of
the French philosopher, such as Of Grammatology (Derrida,
6 SAGE Open
1967) and Dissemination (Derrida, 1972). Crucial in his work
isthelanguageexperience,whichcanbesuchonlyifexpressed
in writing. The written text becomes a brand, an epiphany, a
tangible sign of a word. In Dissemination, in the part dedi-
cated to Plato's Pharmacy, he writes, as follows:
But what does absent or present mean here? As every
text, Plato's could but be connected in a virtual, lateral
dynamic way to all the words which make up the Greek
language system. Associations unite at a distance and in
different ways, the words "effectively present" in a
speech to other words effectively present in a lexical
system. (Derrida, 1972, p. 159; Italian translation, 1989)
This passage taken from Landow (1994) underlines how
the hypertext writing system is present, even if not in a bla-
tant way, in Derrida's analysis. Recalling our attention to
some of the words present in the aforementioned text, such
as virtual, dynamic, lateral, associations, and different ways,
we can identify the elements of hypertextual surfing and the
creation of an active way of reading. The textual implica-
tions of the development of a semantic space seem to be
clear also to Nelson and to T. Berners-Lee (1999), although
the latter is more interested in the technological aspects than
in the literary ones connected to the development of a virtual
environment. Nelson affirms that there are some difficulties
in the sequential writing of a text. These lie in the necessity
for the author to make a choice among the arguments to pres-
ent, which at the same time implies a process of inclusion
and exclusion of both words and concepts. Using a hyper-
text, these difficulties are eliminated because the choice
moves from the sequences to present to the connective struc-
ture of the elements to articulate. It is no longer necessary to
decide what to insert and what to exclude; what is needed is
to identify "where one can fix things in an explorable laby-
rinth" (Nelson, 1990, p. 1/17; Italian translation, 1992). The
limits of traditional writing were also noticed by Calvino
(1973), who broke it up in Il castello dei destini incrociati.
The work consists of some short stories, narrated using a
pack of tarot cards. The position of the cards of the first
player is the link to jump spontaneously to the story of the
following character. It is not necessary to mix the cards again
or to choose new ones: It is their position to suggest the new
story to tell. The combination of the different cards resem-
bles the structure of the hypertext with its links: Hypertexts
allow us to zig zag between words and concepts. Using links,
it is possible to go from one page or paragraph to another.
The indication of the presence of a connection is given by an
active word. The reader can therefore jump from one page to
another activating various links, and this process is called
hypertext surfing. The technological stimulus to create a
hypertext as we know it today came from Berners-Lee
(1999). It is important to consider that the structure of a text
written with multimedia support has a sequentiality and an
impact that have to be distinguished from the linearity of a
traditional printed text. A written text has a spatial structure,
which implies also a temporal structure: According to Bolter
(2001), a written text can, in fact, be compared with an orches-
tral score with its visual representation of the notes on the staff
and its verticality, in the same way of the musician who is able
to read the notes in the spaces without the need to play them.
The complete reading of a text, therefore, involves both a spa-
tial and a temporal dimension (Bolter, 2001, p. 135; Italian
translation, 2002). "Reading is to follow a path among those
suggested by the distribution of the text" (p. 135).
Two cultures tackle the future of writing; two approaches
give a structure to the hypertext net. The labyrinth is not only
a reticulate of links, but also a mythological image.According
to some theoretics, ours is the "civilization of image"; accord-
ing to others, it is the "civilization of writing"; according to
others again, our world is a "global village" or the return to a
second level oral civilization made possible by the electronic
technologies. Indeed, in the experience of gaining access to
the Web or in the knowledge favored by the new electronic
publishing systems, as well as in that which comes from the
globalization of information, we can find the same elements
of simultaneity of oral communication, although they all
make use of hypertextuality. There seems to be the possibility
to talk with somebody about a certain topic and to inform him
or her also about the connections that come before the narra-
tion or the going into the matters more thoroughly.
The Consequences on Experience
A first reorganization of the forms of experience is due to the
development of modern society: The increase of knowledge
and the possibility to communicate events "distant" from
our daily lives have determined what J. B. Thompson
(1995) calls a release from sequestration of experience.
Such release from sequestration is carried out by the press,
but also by the radio and the television, which have the capa-
bility of clearly transmitting news geographically distant
from those who receive them. Thompson calls this kind of
experience "mediated experience" to distinguish it from the
lived experience of W. Dilthey's (1924) Erlebnis. The char-
acteristics attributed to the latter are immediacy, the being
continuous and, to a certain extent, instinctive, but it is also
the "experience we have in the practical contexts of daily
life" (Thompson, 1995, p. 315; Italian translation, 1998).
This experience is the result of the activities and the encoun-
ters we have everyday, and in this sense, it is different from
the one determined by media interactions, which expanding
in space and time allow an intimacy with other people who
do not share the same spatial­temporal environment and are
therefore "distant" (p. 305). Thompson indicates four sub-
stantial differences between mediated and lived experience.
First of all, mediated experiences are those that take place
in situations distant from daily life. Then they are contextu-
alized differently, in the sense that people gain access to
them in places that are different from those where they are

happening. A third element that distinguishes a mediated
experience from a lived one comprises the priorities it is
characterized by. With this, the author means to say that if
the self is like a symbolic project that the individual
models and re-models during his/her life, we must
then admit that such project presupposes a scale of the
most important things, which can also be continuously
modified: This scale decides the relevance or irrele-
vance of the real and potential experiences. This struc-
ture of priorities is an integral part of our project of
life. (pp. 317-318)
The structure of the priorities attributed to mediated expe-
riences is different and from certain points of view inferior to
the one attributed to lived experiences because, in the first
case, also when certain appointments become a routine, the
relationship that the self establishes with them remains weak.
The fourth element considered is called "de-spatialized com-
monality." This is necessary to stress the difference in the
proximity of the sharing of the experience. In fact, in the case
of a lived experience, the place in which this takes place is
the same for all the actors who are experiencing it; this does
not happen in the case of mediated experiences because
these permit the actors to live the same experiences even
though they are not sharing a similar life environment. At the
end of this analysis, Thompson then asks himself what hap-
pens to the self in a world in which mediated experience
plays such a deep role in the life of people and in which the
self is liberated from its ties with the practical contexts of
daily life. Here, we affirm instead that the need to make medi-
ated experience daily and therefore close to us in its context,
time, and place has as a consequence that people--or some
people--look for it as a media-lived experience. The new
means of communication allow us to have what we describe
here as "media lived experiences." They can be connected to
Dilthey's experience because they are inserted in the tempo-
ral flow of daily life, but also to the media. The media allow
that experience can be, one, "mediated" because it is known
through the media and, other, "mediatic" because the indi-
vidual has the opportunity to live the experience entering the
medium.
The Consequences onThought
Let us start from the end, reading what Carr (2010) writes at
the end of his book: "An intellectual technology exercises its
influence changing the focus of our thought." We are nearly
at the end of a book when the author himself admits that he
had to disconnect from the Web to see light and this because
the Internet changes our capability of "working on a piece"
for a long time.
The consequences of the Internet on our cognitive modali-
ties can be enclosed in that short statement: The Internet is an
intellectual technology, and like all intellectual technologies,
it widens and strengthens our mental capabilities and it
requires an exploration modality that is different from that of
other technologies; with time and in time the way in which
information is structured inside itself changes (as a conse-
quence) our "way" of organizing and storing information.
We cannot look to the Internet as a lived experience distinct
from the rest of life; Haythornthwaite and Wellman (2002)
suggest that we think of the Internet as "embedded in every-
day life."
In time, there have been various intellectual technologies.
Carr mentions the map and the mechanical clock--the map
as an example of the change in the representation of space
and the mechanical clock, instead, as the emblem of how
time and natural and social organisms have been represented.
When the map and the clock became of common use, they
changed our language, sense of abstraction, and thought.
God became this way the Great Clockmaker. His cre-
ation was no longer a mystery to accept. It had become
a problem to resolve. Descartes wrote in 1646: "Without
doubt, when the swallows arrive in Spring, they
behave like clocks." (Carr, 2010; Italian translation,
2011, p. 71)
The Internet and its surfing require forms of extremely
intense mental multitasking. This is because the multisequen-
tiality and the surfing routes allow us to jump from one page
to another, from one information to another very quickly,
generating the anxiety to obtain "new" information. We are
pushed to search and search, reflecting little on what we have
just found. It is a sort of "liquid" information, following
which we move from one page to another. This exercise has
its cost of commutation, which Carr explains presenting the
different studies carried out by psychologists, eye specialists,
and neuropsychiatrists. Recalling what M. Jackson (2008)
writes in Distracted: The Erosion of Attention and the Coming
Dark Age, we can say that in Internet multitasking, surfing
the brain takes time to pass from one page to another, having
to reset its objectives very quickly and to remember the rules
required to perform one task and then another. This multi-
tasking activity allows us to acquire a capability of reorga-
nizing our research activities very quickly, but we lose the
depth of thought. We are often interrupted while we are per-
forming an activity on the Web, but we often want to be
interrupted because we know that every interruption carries
with itself some precious information, because the Web is
able to monitor events, to update, and, therefore, to tell us
everything that we need to know. The consequence is that the
Web encourages us to face a wide range of topics, but at a
"superficial" level.
The episode of Vittorio Alfieri's life, in which wishing to
learn Latin, he ties himself to a chair until he learns it, is well
known. From this experience derives the famous sentence:
Volli, sempre volli, fortissimamente volli esser poeta e lo fui
(I wanted, I always wanted, I very strongly wanted to be a
8 SAGE Open
poet and I was one). This is an approach to knowledge that
excludes any form of distraction to be able to learn in-depth.
Today,Alfieri would have probably simply looked for a good
search engine for translation and linguistic adaptation to
translate in Latin his works written in volgare--and this,
while he kept simultaneously open his Facebook pages, his
electronic mail, and a few online newspapers. He probably
would have never felt the need to learn Latin. But we should
also ask ourselves, "Would he today have written anything
without his computer and without an Internet connection?"
