Abstract
In neurocysticercosis, parasite-induced immune suppressive effects are thought to play an important role in enabling site-
specific inhibition of inflammatory responses to infections. It is axiomatic that microglia-mediated (M1 proinflammatory)
response causes central nervous system inflammation; however, the mechanisms by which helminth parasites modulate
microglia activation remain poorly understood. Here, we show that microglia display a diminished expression of
M1-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and nitric oxide synthase 2
(NOS2) in murine neurocysticercosis. Microglia also exhibited a lack of myeloid cell maturation marker major histocom-
patibility complex (MHC)-II in these parasite-infected brains. Treatment of microglia with helminth soluble/secreted factors
(HSFs) in vitro did not induce expression of M1-inflammatory signature molecule NOS2 as well as MHC-II in primary
microglia. However, HSF treatment completely inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced increase in expression of MHC-II,
NOS2 and nitric oxide production in these cells. As epigenetic modulation of chromatin states that regulates recruitment
of RNA polymerase II (Pol-II) is a key regulatory step in determining gene expression and functional outcome, we next
evaluated whether HSF induced modulation of these phenomenon in microglia in vitro. Indeed, HSF downregulated Pol-II
recruitment to the promoter region of TNF-a, IL-6, NOS2, MHC-II, and transcription factor CIITA (a regulator of MHC-II
expression), by itself. Moreover, HSF suppressed the lipopolysaccharide-induced increase in Pol-II recruitment as well. In
addition, HSF exposure reduced the positive histone marks H3K4Me3 and H3K9/14Ac at the promoter of TNF-a, IL-6,
NOS2, MHC-II, and CIITA. These studies provide a novel mechanistic insight into helminth-mediated immune suppression in
microglia via modulation of epigenetic processes.

Introduction
Infection of the central nervous system (CNS) by the ces-
tode Taenia solium (T. solium) results in neurocysticerco-
sis (NCC), the most common parasitic disease affecting
50 to 100 million people worldwide (White, 2000). Signs
and symptoms of NCC may include the following: seiz-
ures, strokes, hydrocephalus, and symptoms associated
with increased intracranial (i.c.) pressure (Nash et al.,
2006). Indeed, NCC is the number one cause of epilepsy
and contributes to as many as half of the total adult-onset
seizures (White, 1997; Garcia and Del Brutto, 2005).
Effective treatment for NCC remains a challenge, as the
severity of disease symptoms is thought to be a result of
pathologic inflammatory response induced by the

degenerating larvae (Roman et al., 2000; White, 2000;
Sciutto et al., 2007). Interestingly, NCC is typically asso-
ciated with a long initial asymptomatic phase lasting sev-
eral years before the onset of symptomatic phase (White
et al., 1997; White, 2000; Restrepo et al., 2001). This
asymptomatic phase is correlated with a lack of detect-
able inflammation in the CNS, presumably due to the
ability of the cysticerci to induce immune suppression
(White et al., 1997; White, 2000; Restrepo et al., 2001).
Indeed, in NCC patient brains, a lack of surface expres-
sion of activation/maturation marker major histocom-
patibility complex (MHC)-II in macrophages has been
documented in areas around the larvae (Alvarez et al.,
2008). Thus, parasite-derived molecules likely play an
important role in suppression of inflammation in the
CNS helminth infection. Understanding these immune
suppressive mechanisms may help develop new ways of
therapeutically regulating CNS inflammation in NCC
and other pathological condition.
Inflammation in the CNS in response to diverse stimu-
lus, for example, infection, injury, or trauma, is mainly
regulated by the innate immune response (Ramesh et al.,
2013a; Kielian, 2014). Among the nervous tissue cell
types, microglia serve as the primary innate immune cell
providing first line of response (Rivest, 2009; Cherry et al.,
2014). When activated, microglia express a number of
genes and development of inflammatory responses,
depending on the nature, intensity, and duration of the
insult. The functional phenotypes of microglia vary in
response to external stimuli these cells receive through a
wide variety of surface receptors. Microglia displaying the
classical activation phenotype (M1) release multiple
proinflammatory cytokines and generally promote the
destruction of pathogens, but also cause widespread
bystander tissue damage as a result of their overactivation
(Kobayashi et al., 2013). However, the mechanisms
underlying helminth-induced suppression of M1-inflam-
matory signature in microglia are not clearly understood.
Microbial products (e.g., lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) or
endogenous inflammatory stimuli (e.g., interferon
gamma) activate myeloid innate immune cells types,
such as microglia and macrophages, to produce M1-
inflammatory mediators (e.g., antimicrobial peptides,
reactive nitrogen and oxygen species, chemokines and
cytokines; Mosser and Edwards, 2008; Gordon and
Martinez, 2010; Lawrence and Natoli, 2011; Murray
and Wynn, 2011; Kobayashi et al., 2013). Sensing of
such stimuli by surface receptors leads to activation of
downstream NF-kB (Nuclear Factor Kappa B), MAPK
(Mitogen-activated protein kinase), and JAK-STAT
(Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of tran-
scription) signaling pathways (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010)
that have been found to integrate into a coherent pattern
of changes in epigenetic landscape and subsequent gene
transcription (Natoli et al., 2011). Indeed, genome-wide
analyses have clearly shown that epigenetic chromatin
marks are dynamically regulated in response to diverse
stimuli (Zhou et al., 2011). The expression of genes are
associated with functionally distinct polarizing class of
histone marks (Ernst et al., 2011), for example, positive
histone marks, H3K4me3 and H3K9/14Ac are associated
with actively transcribed genes, whereas H3K27me3 are
associated with gene repression (Medzhitov and Horng,
2009; Smale, 2010). In stimulated cells, these events invol-
ving chromatin marks regulate accessibility around the
promoter region and facilitate RNA polymerase (Pol) II
recruitment to the promoter (Adelman et al., 2009). The
cascade of events that follows ultimately leads to Pol-II
elongation and productive RNA synthesis (Adelman
et al., 2009). In toto, epigenetic events involving chroma-
tin marks contribute to Pol-II recruitment to the gene
promoter, and Pol-II-dependent transcription elongation
is important for gene transcription (Rogatsky and
Adelman, 2014). An important question, therefore, is
whether helminths induce modulation of epigenetic mech-
anisms involving chromatin marks, Pol-II recruitment,
and elongation that are involved in the inhibition of
inflammatory responses in microglia. This is an under-
studied area of research.
In the present study, using a murine model for NCC
developed by i.c. infection of mice with Mesocestoides
corti (M. corti) metacestodes (Mishra et al., 2008,
2009b; Alvarez et al., 2010a; Mishra et al., 2010;
Gundra et al., 2011), the maturation and activation
phenotype of microglia was determined by the expression
of MHC-II, CIITA, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-
a), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and nitric oxide synthase 2
(NOS2) in parasite-infected brains. To determine whether
epigenetic events of microglia activation and maturation
are affected by the parasite, we tested the effect of hel-
minth soluble/secreted factors (HSFs) on expression of
positive histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K9/14Ac, and
Pol-II recruitment to promoter of immune molecules by
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis.
Moreover, effect of HSF (Sun et al., 2014) on toll-like
receptor (TLR)-induced upregulation of H3K4me3 and
H3K9/14Ac expression, and increased Pol-II recruitment
at the promoter of these immune mediators was analyzed.
Our results presented here show that the regulation of
epigenetic pathways by helminth molecules is likely a
novel immune suppressive mechanism to block micro-
glia-associated M1-inflammatory response in NCC.
Methods
Animals and Antigens
Maintenance of the animals and tissue collection for all
studies presented here were conducted under the guide-
lines of the University of North Dakota's IACUC, the
2 ASN Neuro
U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the National
Institutes of Health. Female BALB/c and C57BL/6
mice used in this study were bred and maintained in the
animal facility at the University of North Dakota SMHS,
Grand Forks, ND. M. corti metacestodes were propa-
gated in the peritoneal cavity of BALB/c mice by serial
intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection. HSF consisting of M. corti
soluble/secreted factors was prepared from M. corti meta-
cestodes by freezing and thawing as described previously
(Chauhan et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014).
Antibodies
The following antibodies were used to analyze microglia
activation and maturation: M1/70 (anti-Mac1), 1D3
(anti-MHC-II), as well as purified anti-mouse TNF-a,
IL-6, and NOS2 (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). For
immunofluorescence (IF) staining, fluorescent-conjugated
secondary antibodies and isotype control antibodies
(Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, West Grove,
PA) were used. Antibodies used in ChIP assays included
anti-Pol-II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology [Dallas, Texas,
USA]) at 2 mg/IP, anti-H3K4Me3 (Millipore [Billerica,
Massachusetts, USA]) at 1 mg/IP, anti-H3K9/14Ac (cell
signaling technology [Danvers, Massachusetts, USA]) at
2 mg/IP, or normal rabbit IgGs.
Histology and IF Staining in Brains During
Murine NCC
Murine NCC was induced by i.c. injection of 50 ml of
HBSS (Hank's balance salt solution) containing approxi-
mately $40 M. corti metacestodes into 5-week old
C57BL/6 mice under short-term anesthesia (Cardona
et al., 1999; Cardona and Teale, 2002; Mishra et al.,
2006, 2009; Chauhan et al., 2014). Mock-infected control
mice were sham injected with 50 ml sterile HBSS alone. At
indicated times postinoculation, anesthetized animals
were perfused through the left ventricle with 20 ml cold
phosphate-buffered saline. The brains were immediately
removed from perfused animals, embedded in O.C.T.
resin, and snap frozen. Serial horizontal cryosections,
10 mm in thickness, were placed on silane prep slides
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The slides were air-
dried overnight and fixed in fresh acetone for 20 s at
room temperature. Acetone-fixed sections were wrapped
in aluminum foil and stored at À80C or processed imme-
diately for in situ IF microscopy analysis as previously
described (Cardona et al., 2003; Mishra et al., 2006;
Alvarez and Teale, 2007a, 2007b). To rule out any non-
specific staining, several control experiments were per-
formed. In each case, sections were blocked with
saturating concentrations of appropriate isotype control
antibodies or host serum antibodies to eliminate FcR-
mediated nonspecific binding. In addition, staining in
the absence of primary antibodies was performed as
negative controls.
Primary Microglia Maturation and Activation
Microglia were purified from postnatal Day 1 (P1) mouse
brains (C57BL/6) as previously described (Floden et al.,
2005; Nagamoto-Combs and Combs, 2010; Sun et al.,
2014). Briefly, meninges-free cortices from P1 mice were
isolated and trypsinized. Cells were plated onto tissue cul-
ture plastic in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(DMEM)-F-12 with L-glutamine (Invitrogen [Waltham,
Massachusetts, USA]) containing 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum and 5% heat-inactivated horse serum
and fed every third day. After $14 days, the cultures were
shaken vigorously (30 min; 120 rpm on a rotary shaker) to
remove microglia. Microglia purity was routinely deter-
mined to be $90% cells by IF microscopy using specific
markers IBA-1 or CD11b and negative staining for glial
fibrillary acidic protein (a marker for astrocytes). The cells
were plated at 1.5 Â 106 per well in six-well plates and were
incubated for 24 hr at 37C in medium alone, or in the
presence of HSF, LPS, or HSF/LPS. After 24 hr poststi-
mulation, microglia were surface stained with anti-MHC-
II to measure expression of this maturation marker using
a BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) as we have
previously described (Chauhan et al., 2014). The gating
scheme included discrimination of single cells from doub-
lets by plotting linear forward-scatter height versus for-
ward-scatter area. Live microglia cells were then selected
by plotting side scatter versus the Am Cyan channel,
which included the live/dead stain (live gate). From the
live gate, MHC-II þ cells were selected via side scatter
versus Alexa 700 channel. Gates for MHC-II þ cells
were set based on isotype control staining. FlowJo v7.6
(Treestar) was used for all flow cytometry analyses.
To test the inhibitory effect of HSF on production of
nitric oxide (NO), the cells were plated at 8 Â 104 cells per
well in 96-well flat-bottom plates and were stimulated
with medium alone, or in the presence of HSF, TLR
ligand LPS, or HSF/LPS. Culture supernatants were col-
lected 24 hr after stimulation, and NO production was
measured by using the Griess reagent (Promega
[Fitchburg, Wisconsin, United States]) according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
ChIP Experiments
ChIP experiments were carried out as previously
described (Dhasarathy et al., 2007; Adelman et al.,
2009). Briefly, microglia were seeded into 15-cm dishes
and were pulsed with medium alone, or in the presence
of HSF, LPS, HSF/LPS for 24 hr at 37C. Cells were
cross-linked with formaldehyde for 10 min at room tem-
perature, followed by addition of 125 mM glycine for
Chauhan et al. 3
5 min at 4C for quenching formaldehyde. Cells were
washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and har-
vested. Cells were lysed by sonication with a previously
determined optimal cycle conditions to generate 250- to
150-bp DNA fragments using Covaris Sonicater.
Immunoprecipitation was performed with the antibodies
indicated, and IgG was used as a control. Precipitated
DNAs were detected by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) using specific primers. Sequences of the specific
primers used for IL-6, NOS2, TNF-a, H2Eb (MHC-II
domain in C57BL/6), CIITA, and GAPDH are as fol-
lows: IL-6 (sense) 50-ACTCCTCTCTCACAGT

and (antisense) 50-TTCTGAGTGCTGCCTGCATGC-
30; and GAPDH (Active Motif Cat # 71018). Real-time
PCR analysis on respective immunoprecipitated DNA
was performed using SYBR green as the detection dye
(Mishra et al., 2008). The percent input for each sample
was calculated based on a standard curve using 10%, 1%,
0.1%, and 0.01% of input DNA. Precipitated DNA with
anti-IgG served as a background control.
Statistical Analysis
Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance was used
to compare the means of different groups (SIGMA PLOT
8.0 [Systat Software, San Jose, CA]). A p value of less
than .05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Microglia in Murine NCC Brains Exhibit Attenuated
Inflammatory Phenotype/Profile
The kinetics of microglial expression of MHC-II, TNF-a,
IL-6, and NOS2 were compared by in situ IF microscopy
in brain tissues from mock-infected and NCC mice.
Microglia were identified by IF microscopy using cell
markers CD11b together with their characteristic morph-
ology and location in brain parenchyma. In normal
physiological conditions, microglia exhibit resting/quies-
cent phenotypes with low basal level expression of
CD11b, while an increased CD11b expression is among
the earliest signs of microglial response (Frick et al.,
2013). As expected, the CD11b expression was detected
at a low/undetected basal level in microglia in mock-
infected brains as compared with the parasite-infected
brains (Figure 1). Importantly, the expression of the
M1-inflammatory molecules, MHC-II, NOS2, TNF-a,
and IL-6 were minimally detected in the brain of mock-
infected animals (Figure 1(A1), (B1), (C1), and (D1)).
In the parasite-infected brains, expression of MHC-II
(Figure 1(A2)), NOS2 (Figure 1(B2)), TNF-a
(Figure 1(C2)), or IL-6 (Figure 1(D2)) proteins were
barely detected or undetected in microglia cells in brain
parenchyma at 1 week, and 3 week p.i. (Figure 1(A3),
(B3), (C3), and (D3)). However, IL-6 was upregulated
in cells with morphology similar to those of astrocytes
localized to the brain anatomical region in proximity to
the meninges (Figure 1(E1)), suggesting a microglia-spe-
cific immune suppression. IF staining using isotype con-
trol Ab or staining in the absence of primary antibodies
(only fluorescent-conjugated secondary Ab) did not show
any signal (Figure 1(E2) and (E3), and data not shown).
Specificity of the staining was also confirmed by perform-
ing positive control IF microscopy analysis to detect
expression of MHC-II, NOS2, and TNF-a or IL-6 after
Francisella novicida infection. As expected, upon intrana-
sal infection, bacteria-infected lung tissues displayed
extensive staining for MHC-II, NOS2, and TNF-a
(data not shown). Thus, the low to undetected levels of
expression of M1-inflammatory molecules in microglia
was specific to parasite infection and suggests a defect
in the activation of these cells in helminth parasite-
infected brains.
HSF Inhibits Maturation and Activation of Microglia
In Vitro
Next, the effect of helminth molecules on maturation of
primary microglia was analyzed in vitro. Flow cytometric
analysis revealed that exposure to HSF itself did not
affect the surface expression of the myeloid cell matur-
ation marker MHC-II in microglia as compared with the
untreated cells (Figure 2(A1) and (A2)). We have recently
reported that helminth molecules inhibit LPS-induced
maturation of bone marrow-derived macrophages
(MT; Chauhan et al., 2014). We thus examined the
effect of HSF on LPS-induced MHC-II expression in pri-
mary microglia. Microglia stimulated with LPS alone
exhibited an upregulated surface expression of MHC-II
(Figure 2(A1) and (A2)). This LPS-induced activation of
microglia was completely blocked upon exposure of cells
to HSF (Figure 2(A1) and (A2)). Furthermore, these
microglia treated with HSF alone, or when exposed to
LPS in the presence and absence of HSF, displayed simi-
lar levels of viability as the medium alone (as examined
by MTT assay), suggesting the specificity of the immune
suppressive effect of HSF.
As NOS2 expression and subsequent NO production is
a signature for M1-inflammatory phenotype of myeloid
cells (Jenkins and Allen, 2010), we then tested the effect of

HSF alone as well as on LPS-induced production of NO
in microglia. LPS stimulation activated microglia to
secrete large amounts ($150 mM/ml and $250 mM at 24
and 48 hr post exposure) of NO (Figure 2(B), data not
shown). In contrast, NO was undetected in culture super-
natant of untreated or HSF-stimulated microglia (Figure
2(B)). Interestingly, coexposure to HSF completely inhib-
ited the LPS-induced secretion of NO (Figure 2(B)).
Interestingly, this blocking effect of HSF was independ-
ent of whether the cells were costimulated with HSF and
LPS together or HSF was added before or after the add-
ition of LPS to the culture (Figure 2(B)). Furthermore,
HSF alone did not modulate gene expression of NOS2,
the enzyme responsible for inducible NO production at
both 12 hr and 20 hr post stimulation (Figure 2(C)).
However, HSF also inhibited LPS-induced NOS2
mRNA expression (Figure 2(C)). Together, the results
from these studies clearly demonstrate an inhibitory
effect of HSF on microglia-associated M1-
inflammatory response.
HSF Downregulates Pol-II Recruitment at the
Promoter of Inflammatory Mediators
An important step in the regulation of gene expression is
the recruitment of Pol-II along with the general
Figure 2. Helminth antigens downregulated agonist-induced maturation and activation of microglia. Primary microglia were pulsed with
medium alone (NS), HSF at 25 mg/ml, LPS (L) at 10 ng/ml, or HSF at 25 mg/ml prior to the addition of LPS in the medium (HSF þ L) and
cultured for a total of 24-hr period. (A1) Microglia were harvested and flow cytometry analysis was performed to measure surface
expression of MHC-II (A1). Dotted line in the histogram shows control staining with isotype/fluorochrome control Ab, and filled line

measured by real-time PCR analysis as described using SYBR green as the detection dye. NOS2 mRNA level was normalized to the mRNA
level of 18 S in the same sample, and fold change in mRNA expression of NOS2 after each treatment over their respective baseline control
level in unstimulated samples was expressed in arbitrary units. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments.

transcription factors that enable the initiation of RNA
synthesis (Rogatsky and Adelman, 2014). We next exam-
ined the effect of HSF on the recruitment of Pol-II to the
promoter of MHC-II, CIITA, TNF-a, IL-6, and NOS2
using ChIP assays. As positive control, the level of Pol-II
occupancy at the housekeeping GAPDH in the same
sample was measured. As negative control, ChIP analysis
using isotype IgG antibody was performed on the same
samples. Compared with the untreated microglia, HSF-
stimulated cells displayed a significantly decreased Pol-II
occupancy at the promoter of all the immune mediators
analyzed (MHC-II, CIITA, TNF-a, IL-6, and NOS2;
Figure 3(A) to (E)). The effect of HSF on LPS-induced
Pol-II recruitment to the promoter of the previously men-
tioned host mediators was examined. As expected, expos-
ure to LPS significantly increased Pol-II occupancy at the
promoter regions of MHC-II (Figure 3(B)), CIITA
(Figure 3(A)), NOS2 (Figure 3(C)),TNF-a (Figure
3(D)), and IL-6 (Figure 3(E)), whereas minimal to no
Pol-II occupancy was observed using the isotype IgG
antibodies (data not shown). This effect of LPS was sig-
nificantly inhibited in the presence of HSF (Figure 3). In
contrast, HSF, LPS, HSF/LPS stimulation had no signifi-
cant effect on Pol-II occupancy at the housekeeping gene
GAPDH, as compared with the untreated microglia (data
not shown). Moreover, as helminth infections are known
to induce markers associated with M2 in helminth infec-
tions (Harn et al., 2009; Jenkins and Allen, 2010; Mishra
et al., 2010), Pol-II occupancy was examined at the pro-
moter regions of Arginase-1 (a signature marker of M2
activation phenotype). As compared with control cells,
HSF-stimulated cells displayed a significantly increased
Pol-II occupancy at the promoter of Arginase-1
(Figure 3(F)). In contrast, no difference in Pol-II occu-
pancy was observed at the promoter of Arginase-1 after
LPS exposure, which was significantly augmented in the
presence of HSF (Figure 3(F)). Taken together, results
from these experiments suggest that HSF inhibited Pol-
II recruitment at the promoter of the inflammatory
immune mediators in microglia.
HSF Downregulates Positive Histone Marks at the
Promoter of Inflammatory Mediators
Chromatin states, defined by well-established combin-
ations of histone marks, determine the magnitude of
gene expression by cells in response to extracellular sti-
muli (Ernst et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011). Events invol-
ving histone marks lead to chromatin remodeling in the
promotor-proximal, which in turn modulates Pol-II bind-
ing to the promoter. Positive histone marks such as
H3K4me3 and H3K9/14Ac are essential for making the
promoter region accessible to Pol-II and transcription
factors (Natoli et al., 2011). Thus, the effect of HSF on
the expression of H3K4me3 and H3K9/14Ac at the
promoters of the previously mentioned inflammatory
mediators was analyzed (Figure 4). ChIP analysis
revealed that HSF alone downregulated H3K9/14Ac
mark at the promoter region of all the inflammatory
mediators analyzed (Figure 4(A1), (B1), (C1), (D1), and
(E1)). Moreover, coculturing with HSF significantly
inhibited the LPS-induced increase in the expression of
H3K9/14Ac mark at the promoter region of MHC-II,
CIITA, TNF-a, IL-6, and NOS2 (Figure 4(A1), (B1),
(C1), (D1), and (E1)). In contrast, incubation of HSF
alone had no significant measurable effect on
H3K4Me3 at the promoters of most of the measured
inflammatory mediators (Figure 4(B2), (C2), (D2), and
(E2)) with the exception of CIITA (Figure 4(A2)) that
significantly reduced by HSF alone as compared with
the untreated microglia. However, as expected, exposure
of LPS induced a significant increase in H3K4Me3 marks
at the promoters of all of these M1-inflammatory medi-
ators (Figure 4(A2), (B2), (C2), (D2), and (E2)).
Costimulation of HSF and LPS substantially inhibited
the LPS-induced increase in H3K4Me3 marks (Figure
4(A2), (B2), (C2), (D2), and (E2)). Further, ChIP analysis
performed using isotype IgG antibody on the same sam-
ples display a very low reactivity (Figure 3, and data not
shown). Together, these data suggest that chromatin
modification by helminth antigens is an important
immunosuppressive mechanism of inhibition of inflam-
matory gene expression.
Discussion
NCC typically has a biphasic course: an initial phase of
parasitic infection that is characterized with a lack of
detectable CNS inflammation, followed by a symptom-
atic phase associated with hyper-inflammation (Mishra
et al., 2009a; Alvarez et al., 2010b). Microglia often func-
tion as first responder cell type in the CNS that regulates
the development of CNS inflammation (Nayak et al.,
2012). Indeed, an imbalance of microglia activation
resulting in deleterious and prolonged inflammation has
been directly correlated with a majority of the neuro-
pathological conditions (Ramesh et al., 2013a, 2013b).
In contrast, suppression of innate immune activation
mechanisms of microglia may contribute to a downregu-
lated inflammatory response that is characteristic of
asymptomatic NCC. Thus, an improved understanding
of microglia activation phenotypes and the mechanism
underlying the downregulation of inflammatory gene
expression in NCC is warranted. Here, we show that
microglia in murine NCC fail to acquire a mature/acti-
vated phenotype, and the suppression of the signature
inflammatory molecules by helminth parasite is regulated
via alteration in Pol-II recruitment and positive histone
marks at the promoter of these gene loci. Our results
strongly suggest that helminth modulates epigenetic

pathway to regulate microglial inflammation that may in
turn be an important regulatory mechanism to block
CNS inflammation in brain helminth infections,
including NCC.
The present studies were designed to analyze the acti-
vation phenotype of microglia in murine NCC. We
assessed the expression of M1 signature inflammatory
cytokines TNF-a and IL-6 in microglia in the CNS
during M. corti infection. In addition, we analyzed the
expression of MHC-II, which is indicative of maturation
of myeloid cells, and NOS2 that is a classical M1 myeloid
activation phenotype marker (Kreider et al., 2007). Our
results show that TNF-a and IL-6 were undetected in
microglia. Moreover, expression of MHC-II and NOS2
was practically undetected in these cells in murine NCC
brains. This is in line with our recent report where a simi-
lar trend of low/diminished expression of costimulatory
molecules such as CD80 and CD86 was observed in infil-
trating macrophages in brains of parasite-infected mice
(Chauhan et al., 2014). We also reported that there is a
low/undetectable level of MHC-II in many of the infil-
trating macrophages in parasite-infected brains of NCC
mice. The in vitro experiments using primary microglia
similarly demonstrated inhibition of agonist-induced
MHC-II and NOS2 expression by helminth factors.
Together, these results clearly demonstrate that helminth
parasite suppress M1-inflammatory activation in micro-
glia. Microglia are critically positioned at the interface
between innate immune activation-induced CNS inflam-
mation and subsequent manifestation of adaptive
immunity in the brain microenvironment. Thus, it is a
reasonable hypothesis that dampening the TLR initiated
inflammatory response is beneficial for parasitic growth
and would also prevent collateral tissue damage due to
excessive inflammation. Moreover, an immature micro-
glial phenotype with low expression of MHC-II down-
regulates the proliferation of activated effector T cells
and induces T cell anergy/regulatory phenotype
(Latchman et al., 2001; Sharpe et al., 2007). Indeed,
expansion of regulatory T cells in the CNS microenvir-
onment has been reported in NCC patient (Adalid-
Peralta et al., 2013). In toto, helminth-induced
downregulation of innate immune pathway activation is
likely crucial in establishment of chronic parasitic infec-
tions as well as for maintaining tissue homeostasis.
Gene transcription is a complex process, but the expres-
sion of gene loci in cells can be broadly divided into three
distinct transitional steps (Rogatsky and Adelman, 2014).
First, the promoter region surrounding the transcription
start site must be accessible through the removal of repres-
sive nucleosomes. Second, Pol-II and general transcrip-
tion factors are recruited to facilitate the priming of
RNA synthesis. Third, stimulation-specific transcriptional
factors and chromatin regulators are recruited to the site
as a result of activation, leading to Pol-II migration and
productive transcription. Epigenetic events consisting of
posttranslational modifications of DNA at the CpG
motifs and DNA binding proteins such as histones, and
noncoding RNA, have been demonstrated to regulate the
previously mentioned three states of transcriptional activ-
ity thereby determining the kinetics and magnitude of gene
expression (Zhou et al., 2011; Buecker and Wysocka,
2012). The majority of these studies has been focused on
macrophages, and it is of note that epigenetic events mod-
ulating microglial gene expression in the context of CNS
inflammation have been understudied. Among these
events, histone modifications have received the most
attention in efforts to understand the activation of inflam-
matory genes. Histone modifications are broadly divided
into positive and negative marks that are typically corre-
lated with the levels of productive and nonproductive gene
expression, respectively (Ernst et al., 2011; Zhou et al.,
2011). In the absence of inflammatory stimuli such as
TLR ligation, inflammatory gene expression is restrained
by the presence of gene-specific negative histone marks
(Fang et al., 2012; Kruidenier et al., 2012; Zhu et al.,
2012). Once the cell receives stimulation through TLR lig-
ands, an increased expression of positive histone marks,
such as H3K4Me3 and H3K9/14Ac, occurs at the pro-
moter of the inflammatory cytokine gene loci (De Santa
et al., 2009; Hargreaves et al., 2009; Escoubet-Lozach
et al., 2011). These positive histone marks are thought to
facilitate chromatin accessibility of genes and binding of
factors such as Pol-II and signaling transcription factors,
to promote transcription elongation (Adelman et al.,
2009). Therefore, it is indeed interesting that we show
here an inhibition of the LPS-induced upregulation of
H3K4Me3 and H3K9/14Ac, as well as suppression of
Pol-II recruitment at the promoter of inflammatory medi-
ators after exposure to immune suppressive helminth-
derived molecules. These findings are in line with earlier
findings that demonstrated that intracellular protozoa
parasite Toxoplasma gondii infection impairs LPS-induced
chromatin remodeling at TNF-a promoter (Leng et al.,
2009) in macrophages. However, unlike Toxoplasma
gondii infection alone, in our studies helminth factors
from M. corti, which is a macroscopic and extracellular
cestode, by themselves downregulated H3K4Me3 and
H3K9/14Ac expression, as well as reduced the Pol-II
recruitment at the promoter of inflammatory mediators
in microglia as compared with the unstimulated cells.
This suggests that extracellular macroscopic helminth
parasites, such as M. corti and T. solium, have likely
acquired additional mechanisms to modulate epigenetic
landscape to deactivate cells such as microglia. However,
to conclusively ascertain this, it will be important to exam-
ine additional epigenetic mechanisms, including the distri-
bution of other positive and negative histone marks, and
their correlation with chromatin conformation and
genome-wide gene expression profile in microglia.
Chauhan et al. 9
In NCC, the loss of helminth-induced immune sup-
pressive mechanisms upon parasite death is thought to
result in the detrimental inflammatory response that con-
tributes to the disease-associated neuropathology (White,
2000; Nash et al., 2006; Sciutto et al., 2007). Moreover,
invasive macroscopic helminth parasites such as M. corti
and T. solium often cause host tissue destruction because
of their size as well as metabolic activity; however, an
inflammatory response is undetected in the asymptomatic
phase. TLRs act as sentinels not only for PAMPs, but
also recognize damage-associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs) from dead and damaged cells and tissues,
resulting in inflammation (Sangiuliano et al., 2014). In
this regard, our results presented here, along with previ-
ous reports (Chauhan et al., 2014), are of particular inter-
est, as they demonstrate helminth factor-mediated
downregulation of the TLR ligation-induced inflamma-
tory response. We speculate that helminth-mediated regu-
lation of epigenetic pathways is likely an important
mechanism involved in the development of the asymp-
tomatic phase. We also anticipate that specific helminth
molecules differentially modulate the gene expression of
inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and tissue repairing
factors by establishing distinct histone marks.
Identifying which of the multitude of histone marks
play specific functional role in determining genome-wide
gene expression in microglia is a major focus of the cur-
rent research in our laboratory.
