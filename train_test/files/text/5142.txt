Are Increasingly More Likely to Be
Observed Than Admitted for Short Stays

Abstract
Observation stays are an outpatient service used to diagnose and treat patients for extended periods of time while a decision
is made regarding inpatient admission or discharge. Although the use of observation stays is increasing, little is known about
which patients are observed and which are admitted for similar periods of time as inpatients. The aim was to identify patient
characteristics associated with being observed rather than admitted for a short stay (<48 hours) within the Veterans Health
Administration (VHA). In our longitudinal analysis, we used logistic regression within a generalized estimating equation
framework to model observation stays as a function of patient characteristics, time trends, and hospital fixed effects. To
minimize heterogeneity between groups, we limit our sample to patients with a presenting diagnosis of chest pain. Our
analysis includes a total of 121
584 hospital events, which consist of all observation and short-stay admissions for chest
pain patients at VHA hospitals between 2005 and 2013. Both the absolute and relative use of observation stays increased
markedly over time. The odds of an observation stay were higher among women, but lower among older patients and
rural residents. Despite strong evidence that chest pain patients are increasingly more likely to be observed than admitted,
suggesting a substitution effect, we find little evidence of within-hospital disparities in VHA observation stay use.

Introduction
Observation stays allow for a period of evaluation and treat-
ment in which to either reach a clinical point for safe dis-
charge or identify a clinical need requiring further inpatient
stay.1 During initial evaluation, the clinical team must bal-
ance expected patient needs, clinical course, and financial
impacts when deciding whether to admit a patient to obser-
vation or inpatient status. With observation stays, the clinical
team must determine a disposition in a finite time (less than
24 hours during our study period), whereas inpatient stays
may be longer. However, unnecessary inpatient admissions
may result in short lengths of stay (less than 48 hours) that
could be managed under observation status.
The effects this decision may have on patients makes it
important to understand which patients get observed and
which get admitted for short stays, particularly as observa-
tion stays are being used more frequently in various settings.
For example, between 2007 and 2009, the prevalence of
observation stays in fee-for-service Medicare increased by
26%.2 Similarly, the observation stay rate in the Veterans
Health Administration (VHA) more than doubled over the
last decade.3 However, it is unclear whether this increase
represents a greater tendency to observe patients who would
have been discharged, or a substitute for patients who would
have been admitted.
Moreover, there is a significant variation in observation
stay use across hospitals in both Medicare and VHA
populations.2,3 This variation may be driven by differences
in the treatment of patients by race, gender, rurality or
other specific characteristics, or by differences in hospital-
specific factors.2,4-13 In the VHA, a number of hospital-level
factors have been identified that partially explain the variation

in observation stay rates across VHA hospitals, including
bed size and patient case mix.14 However, to our knowledge,
no prior studies have explored how patient-level factors may
influence the physician's decision to place a patient in obser-
vation status. To our knowledge, the VHA does not operate
dedicated observation units, meaning that for a patient in a
given bed, the decision to classify a veteran as an inpatient or
place one in observation status is merely a decision made
using a code in the electronic health record, with no distinc-
tion in the care provided. However, this decision is important
because observation stays are an outpatient service, leading
to substantially different payments for hospitals and out-of-
pocket costs for beneficiaries. Specifically, observation stays
subject the veteran to a $50 copayment, whereas inpatient
hospitalizations subject the veteran to a $1288 copayment.
Thus, the objectives of this study are to (1) identify patient
characteristics associated with being observed rather than
admitted for a short stay (ie, 48 hours or less) and (2) deter-
mine the extent to which observation stays are being used as
a substitute for short-stay admissions.
Methods
For this study, we used acute admissions and enrollment data
from fiscal years 2005-2013 of the VHA Patient Treatment
(Inpatient) files and VHA enrollment files. The inpatient
files contain information on dates of service, diagnoses, pro-
vider type, and provider location, for all veterans who used
VHA hospital services in that year. The enrollment files con-
tain veteran age, race, gender, and dates of enrollment, birth,
and death, for all enrolled veterans.
First, we identified all observation stays and short-stay
admissions (48 hours) in the data. Then, we limited our study
sample to individuals who had at least 1 observation stay event
or at least 1 short-stay admission with an initial diagnosis of
chest pain (to minimize case mix heterogeneity between
groups) during a given year. Starting with over 4.4 million
acute admission records, we excluded approximately 4.3 mil-
lion records as shown in Figure 1, leaving 123
976 records
during our 9-year study period. We excluded individuals who
were identified as short-stay admissions because they died or
were transferred within 48 hours, as these stays might have
otherwise extended beyond 48 hours. Twelve VHA hospitals
were excluded from our model because they had no variation
in the outcome, yielding an analytic sample of 121584.
Next, we generated descriptive statistics by fiscal year
across 3 groups of veterans: those with observation stays
only, those with short-stay admissions only, and those with
both observation stay and short-stay admissions in each year.
Within each group, we identified unique individuals by their
first event in each fiscal year, so that descriptive statistics
would not be skewed by high utilizers. We used chi-square
tests to detect differences in categorical variables and the
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to detect differences in continuous
variables between the 3 groups.
Finally, we used logistic regression within a generalized
estimating equation (GEE) framework to model placement
in observation as a function of patient characteristics. Our
dependent variable was a binary indicator for a hospital visit
that was set to 1 if the record was for an observation stay and
0 if the record represented a short-stay admission. As indi-
viduals could have multiple hospital events annually, we
accounted for correlated data within patients using the GEE
method with an exchangeable working correlation structure
and robust standard errors clustered at the patient level.
Our key independent variables were patient race/ethnicity
and rurality of residence, as we aimed to identify racial, eth-
nic, and/or geographic disparities in observation stay use
within the VHA. We also controlled for other patient charac-
teristics, including age, gender, homelessness, copayment
status (based on a veteran's income and service connected
disability), and the number of comorbid conditions a person
had within 1 year of admission, based on International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification algorithms originally developed by Charlson
and updated by Quan and colleagues.15 To detect time trends
in observation stay use, we included a series of year dummy

variables. Finally, we included hospital-specific fixed effects
to capture any time-invariant hospital factors associated with
observation stay use. Inclusion of hospital fixed effects in the
model implies that our estimates capture within-hospital
variation over time in observation stay use. This study was

board with a waiver of informed consent (201403793).
Results
Descriptive statistics are shown in Table 1 separating patients
into 3 different groups based on the type of qualifying admis-
sion they had each year. Due to the large sample size, all
comparisons between the 3 groups are statistically signifi-
cant. Although these groups are not randomly assigned, dif-
ferences between groups are generally small, which suggests
that veterans with an observation stay, veterans with a short-
stay admission, and veterans with both types of stays do not
differ substantially from one another.
The regression model results are shown in Table 2. Female
gender was the only patient factor significantly associated
with an increase in the odds of being placed in observation
rather than admitted for a short stay. Specifically, women had
10% greater odds of being placed in observation than men,
holding all else constant. By contrast, both residence in an
isolated rural area and increasing age were significantly
associated with a decrease in the odds of being placed in
observation. Compared with urban residents, residents of
isolated rural areas had 10% lower odds of being placed in
observation. Relatively large age differences are needed to
observe a meaningful change in the odds of observation. For
example, a 10-year increase in age is associated with a 4%
decrease in the odds of being placed in observation rather
than admitted. Notably, other patient characteristics, includ-
ing race/ethnicity, homelessness, copayment status, and
number of comorbid conditions, were not significant predic-
tors of a patient's likelihood of being placed in observation
rather than admitted for a short stay.
There was a very strong increase in observation stay use
over time. All else being equal, a veteran presenting with
chest pain had 14% higher odds of being placed in observa-
tion rather than admitted for a short stay in 2006 compared
with 2005, and this trend continued over the study period.
By 2013, a veteran presenting with chest pain had 7.3 times
the odds of being observed compared with 2005. Figure 2
shows the trends in the absolute volume of both observation
stays and short-stay admissions over the study period.
Although it depicts an increase in observation stays over
the entire period, clear evidence of observation stays being
used as a substitute for short-stay admissions first appears
between 2010 and 2011. Finally, though we do not report
the individual fixed effects for each VHA hospital, these
were also jointly significant (P < .0001), indicating that
time-invariant unobserved hospital-level characteristics
also contribute to a veteran's likelihood of being placed in
observation.

Discussion
We examined a cohort of chest pain patients to identify patient
characteristics associated with being placed in observation sta-
tus versus admitted for a short stay (48 hours) while control-
ling for differences between VHA hospitals and the increase in
observation stays over time. We also examined the absolute
volume of observation stays and short-stay admissions over
time to gauge the extent to which the former are being used as
a substitute for the latter. Our results suggest that few observ-
able patient characteristics are significant predictors of being
placed in observation rather than admitted. More importantly,
we find little evidence of within-hospital disparities in VHA
observation stay use. Finally, we document a striking increase
in the tendency to place chest pain patients under observation
rather than admit them for a short stay, which descriptive data
suggest is at least partially due to a substitution effect that
emerged suddenly between 2010 and 2011.
We identified a difference in observation stay use by gender,
which particularly in the setting of chest pain is likely to reflect
clinical uncertainty. VHA physicians typically treat fewer
women (eg, women represented fewer than 10% of admissions
in our study), and thus the 10% increase in likelihood of obser-
vation may reflect a discomfort in predicting clinical course
compared with men. However, women more frequently present
with atypical chest pain, and clinicians are more likely to evalu-
ate a woman as having a low pre-test probability of significant
coronary artery disease causing the chest pain presentation, in
which case an observation stay is a logical clinical decision
over an inpatient admission.16-19
We identified a difference in observation stay use between
urban and rural veterans, but we also hesitate to classify this as

a disparity. Veterans from isolated rural areas had 10% lower
odds of being admitted to observation. One likely explanation
is that veterans living in rural settings are more likely to live a
long distance from a hospital. Thus, they would have a lower
threshold for meeting criteria for an inpatient admission, as
they would have difficulty accessing care if their condition
deteriorated unexpectedly at home. In addition, physicians
could recognize that rural patients may have longer hospital-
izations due to challenges coordinating care on discharge lead-
ing to a preference for inpatient admission. Last, this difference
may reflect that urban veterans are more likely to present to
their local VHA hospital for minor complaints associated with
an observation stay, whereas their rural counterparts, particu-
larly those with dual coverage through Medicare, may present
to a non-VHA hospital for these conditions.
Regardless of the various personal characteristics that may
influence their likelihood of being placed in observation,
some well-informed veterans are likely to have a preference
for being placed in observation rather than admitted for a
short stay because of the financial implications of that desig-
nation. A veteran admitted to observation status and paying a
full copay would pay approximately 4% of the amount paid
by a veteran admitted to inpatient status but having a short-
stay admission.20 Thus, for veterans subject to full copayment
amounts, being placed in observation status is financially
beneficial. Although the copayment category variables were
not significant in our model, a practice pattern may be emerg-
ing that defaults patients first to observation, with the knowl-
edge that they will be converted to inpatient status if needed.
Finally, we found that the largest odds ratios were for the
year dummy variables. This, in conjunction with the absolute
number of observation stays and short-stay admissions over
time (Figure 2), suggests that, at least for chest pain patients,
the previously documented increase in observation stay use
within the VHA over the last decade reflects a shift from
short-stay inpatient admissions to observation stays.3 As to
what may be driving this trend, a VHA directive from
February 2014 notes that "Mounting concerns about VA
medical facility overcrowding and the lack of available beds
for patients needing inpatient services have led to the more
frequent utilization of observation status and observation
beds as an alternative to hospital admission or discharge."21
Whether this substitution has had any clinical impact is
unknown and warrants further research.
Our study has several limitations. First, not all veterans
had an observation stay or short-stay admission during our
study period. This might have resulted in our sample being
non-representative of the overall veteran population. Second,
there may be unobserved differences between patients in our
sample that we are unable to account for using administrative
data. However, we minimize this potential heterogeneity by
limiting our sample to patients presenting with a chest pain
diagnosis. Fortunately, both our descriptive statistics and the
results from a prior study found that patients held for obser-
vation were generally similar to patients with short-stay
admissions.22 Third and finally, we are not able to say
whether the use of observation or short-stay admissions was
appropriate for a given patient, which is a question that future
research should address.
Overall, our results suggest that after controlling for the
recent increase in observation stay use across the VHA, and
the marked variation in observation stay use between VHA
hospitals, there are few differences in how observation status
is used among different patients within the same VHA hospi-
tal. However, observation stays are increasingly being used
as a substitute for short-stay admissions among patients pre-
senting with a chest pain diagnosis. Identifying which
patients are placed in observation and which are admitted is
the first step in developing clinical protocols and pathways to
accurately identify which patients are appropriate for obser-
vation. More research is needed to determine whether there
are differences in clinical outcomes following observation
stays versus short-stay admissions.
