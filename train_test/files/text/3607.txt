Introduction
The benefits of calcineurin inhibitors (CI) are vast, both in
the field of solid organ transplants and autoimmune dis-
eases, nevertheless long-term use is limited due to potential
side effects. From a clinical standpoint, nephrotoxicity is
the most common as well as the most relevant side effect.1
In a recent study, Nankivell and colleagues, showed that
after 10 years of CI treatment, 100% of transplanted patients
presented with nephrotoxicity.2 Chronic nephrotoxicity
develops with long-term CI treatment and is mainly charac-
terized by arteriolopathy and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.3,4
Calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity (CIN) is accompanied
by activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and
increased expression of transforming growth factor beta
(TGF), which may be regulated by aldosterone. In experi-
mental models of CIN, the blockade of aldosterone
receptors has been associated with increased survival of
experimental animals.5 Aldosterone may promote develop-
ment of CIN by vasoconstriction and induction of TGF
expression.6 The presence of polymorphisms in the aldos-
terone synthase (AS) gene can influence the activity of
aldosterone.7­9 Two polymorphic variations of this gene

Abstract
Introduction: Aldosterone participates in the pathogenesis of calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity (CIN), producing renal
vasoconstriction and transforming growth factor beta (TGFß) expression. The objective of this study was to assess aldo-
sterone polymorphisms and relationships to plasma aldosterone levels and the development of renal histological lesions
in kidney transplant patients.
Material and methods: Patients with kidney graft biopsy were divided according to the presence or absence of CIN.
We determined aldosterone synthase (AS) -344 T/C and int 2 W/C gene polymorphisms and plasma aldosterone levels.
Histological, biochemical and clinical variables were measured.
Results: Calcineurin inhibitor (CI) levels were significantly higher in patients with the int 2 WW genotype than in patients
with WC or CC genotypes. There was a greater degree of interstitial fibrosis in patients with int 2 CC genotype. No rela-
tionship was found between the different polymorphisms and a higher degree and/or frequency of CIN. There was also
no relationship with plasma aldosterone levels.
Conclusion: The frequency of the different polymorphisms studied was not related to plasma aldosterone levels or the
development of CIN; however, the int 2 CC genotype was related to a greater degree of interstitial fibrosis, whereas the
WW genotype was related to higher CI serum levels.

have been studied. The first one corresponds to a single
nucleotide polymorphism called -344 T/C, which corre-
sponds to the change of thymine/cytosine at the -344 posi-
tion, altering the binding site for the steroidogenic factor 1
of the promoting 5'transcriptional region. It is believed that
this change alters the sensitivity of the gene for angiotensin
II, causing an inappropriately high production of aldoster-
one as related to renin levels.10 The -344T allele has been
associated to an increased risk of hypertension.10,11 Another
polymorphism called int 2 W/C, involves conversion of
intron 2 of the AS gene, which is partially replaced by the
corresponding intron of the CYP11B1 enzyme gene. Its
presence has been associated with hypertension and a
higher aldosterone-renin ratio.7,12 To the best of our knowl-
edge, there has been no study to analyze the relationship
between polymorphism variations of the SA gene and
development of CIN.
Materials and methods
Subjects
Patients with renal transplantation and kidney graft biopsy
were included between January 2000 and December 2009.
All kidney graft biopsies were performed according to pro-
tocolized Nephrology Department guidelines. The first
group included patients with histological diagnosis of CIN
(n=24); the second group included patients in whom CIN
(n=55) was dismissed. Clinical data were documented. The
ethics committee of our institution approved the clinical
protocol.
DNA extraction
Genomic DNA from whole blood containing ethylenediami-
netetraacetic acid (EDTA) was isolated using the standard
technique.13
Determination of the CYP11B2 genotypes
Two polymorphisms in the AS gene were studied (-344 C/T
located in the promoter region, and int 2 W/C located in the
second intron). The -344C/T (rs1799998) single nucleotide
polymorphism was genotyped using 5'exonuclease TaqMan
genotyping assays on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time Polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) system, according to manufacturer's
instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). On
the other hand, the Int 2 W/C polymorphism was detected by
allele-specific PCR as previously reported.10 Reactions
were made separately, using primer 1 with reverse primer
and primer 2 with reverse primer. Used primers were: (primer
1) 5'-TGGAGAAAAGCCCTACCCTGT-3' and (reverse
primer) 5'-AGGAACCTCTGCACGGCC-3'for the wild type
allele and (primer 2) 5'-CAGAAAATCCCTCCCCCCTA-3'
and (reverse primer) 5'-AGGAACCTCTGCACGGCC-3'
for the variant. PCR conditions were as follows: (a) 94°C
for 2 min (b) 94°C for 1 min, 30 s at 66°C and 40 s at 72°C
(repeated for 30 cycles), and (c) a final 7 min extension at
72°C. Amplifications were performed in a Perkin Elmer
PCR System thermocycler, model 9700 from Applied
Biosystems. A 1.8% agarose gel with ethidium bromide
staining was visualized, using a UV Transilluminator.
Plasma aldosterone levels
Plasma aldosterone levels of a peripheral blood sample
obtained at rest in the supine position were measured and
analyzed using a radioimmunoassay method. All patients
received a diet with a daily salt intake of 3­4 g.
Histological analysis
The kidney biopsy was taken according to the previously
described standard technique; one to three cylindrical frag-
ments of renal cortex, processed for light microscopy,
were studied. Tissues were processed according to stand-
ard techniques and were embedded in paraffin to obtain 3
µm sections. Sections for light microscopy were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS),
methenamine silver, and Masson's trichrome. They were
observed under the microscope at 200× and 400× magnifi-
cation, in consecutive fields and graded histologically
according to the Banff classification. Histopathological
CIN criteria were presence of hyaline nodules and/or grade
2 or 3 arteriolopathy.
Statistical analysis
Results are stated as mean±standard deviation (SD) or
proportions. Comparison of means between two groups
was performed using the Student`s t test for independent
samples or its nonparametric alternative (U of Mann
Whitney). Comparison of proportions between groups
was performed using the chi-square (2) test. Comparison
of variables between study groups divided by genotype
was performed with one-factor analysis of variance
(ANOVA), using the Bonferroni test for multiple com-
parisons of means. Spearman's Rho coefficient was used
to search for associations. All probabilities were two-
tailed and the level of significance was set at 0.05. Data
were analyzed using the SPSS statistical package, version
15 for Windows.
Allele and genotypic frequencies of AS gene polymor-
phisms were determined by direct counting. Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium using the X2 test was assessed in
each study group. Differences between groups were deter-
mined by using the Mantel-Haenzel X2 test, which com-
bines 2×2 contingency tables. When any cell number being
compared was less than five, Fisher's exact test was used.

Relative risk with a confidence interval of 95% was
assessed as an odds ratio using the Woolf method.
Results
We studied a total of 79 patients who received a kidney
transplant and immunosuppressive therapy, including a cal-
cineurin inhibitor, at the Nephrology Department, National
Institute of Cardiology in the period between January 2000
and December 2009. Patients were divided into two groups:
group A included 55 patients with a renal graft biopsy that
ruled out CIN, and group B included 24 patients with a CIN
diagnosis. Biopsies (Figures 1 and 2) with any of the fol-
lowing histological criteria were considered positive for
CIN: hyaline nodules and/or arteriolopathy grade 2 or 3. Of
all the cases studied, 46 were men (58%) and 33 were
women (42%). Group A consisted of 33 men (60%) and 22
women (40%) and group B included 13 men (54%) and 11
women (46%). Mean age was 30.3±10.5 years (range: 15­
61 years) in all 79 patients; 29.2±9.9 years (range: 15­56
years) in group A and 33.3±12.2 years (range: 16­61 years)
in group B. Clinical and demographic characteristics are
shown in Table 1.
At the time the biopsy was performed, systolic and dias-
tolic blood pressures were significantly higher in group B
than in group A.
Post-transplant median follow-up for group A was 16
months (interquartile range (IQR) 25­75: 6­34) and for
group B, 16.5 months (IQR 25­75: 4­25), (p=not signifi-
cant (NS)).
Development of post-transplant hypertension was found
in 71% of patients in group B and in 53% of patients in
group A (p=NS). There was no significant difference
between groups comparing the proportion of cases using
antihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers.
Mean uric acid serum level for both groups was 7.2±2.1
mg/dl (range: 3.6­12.6 mg/dl), being significantly higher in
group B. There was no significant difference in plasma
aldosterone levels or in any of the other biochemical varia-
bles analyzed. From all patients tested, we were able to
obtain blood samples to determine the genetic polymor-
phisms only in 54 patients: 40 in group A and 14 in group B.
For the -344 T/C polymorphism, we found four homozy-
gous TT individuals (28.5%) in group B, compared to 22
(55%) in group A (p=NS). We found the CC genotype in
three cases (21.4%) in group B and 9 cases (22.5%) in
groupA(p=NS).As to the TC heterozygous genotype, there
were seven (50%) cases in group B and nine cases (22.5%)
in groupA(p=NS). Regarding the int 2 W/C polymorphism,
we found seven homozygous WW individuals (50%) in
group B compared to 19 (47.5%) in group A (p=NS). The
CC genotype was present in one patient in group B (7.1%)
and six patients in group A (15%) (p=NS). The WC hete-
rozygous genotype was present in 6 cases in group B
(42.8%) and 15 cases (37.5%) in group A (p=NS).
Clinical and biochemical variables were compared
according to each genotype and results are shown in Tables 2
and 3. When comparing the different genotypes of the -344
T/C polymorphism, we found no significant differences in
the analyzed variables. Regarding the int 2 W/C polymor-
phism, the patients expressing the wild WW homozygous
genotype exhibited higher levels of CI at the time of graft
biopsy, compared to cases with WC and CC genotypes.
Likewise, aldosterone plasma levels, according to each

genotype, were compared. In the case of the int 2 W/C poly-
morphism, a tendency for higher levels of aldosterone was
found in cases with the CC genotype. Plasma aldosterone
levels also tended to be higher in cases with the -344 TC
genotype. No significant differences were found when
comparing the frequency of post-transplant hypertension
according to genotypes (Table 4).
The presence of the different polymorphisms studied
was not significantly related to the frequency and degree of
CIN, however cases with the int 2 CC genotype showed a
significantly higher degree of interstitial fibrosis compared
to all other groups (Table 5).
Discussion
The study's objective was to determine the frequency of
-344 T/C and int 2 W/C polymorphisms and to assess
whether there is any risk associated to the genotype for
development of CIN in patients with a kidney transplant.
Numerous research studies have assessed the relationship
between AS gene polymorphisms and aldosterone syn-
thesis and secretion in diseases in which this hormone
has been implicated.7,10­12 When assessing aldosterone
plasma levels in this study, as related to the distribution
of allelic and genotypic frequency in patients with
and without CIN, no significant differences were found
between groups. Nevertheless, we showed a tendency
toward higher levels of aldosterone with C allele of the
int 2 W/C polymorphism. Regarding the -344 T/C
polymorphism, the TC genotype was related to a higher
aldosterone level. However, in both cases, the difference
did not reveal statistical significance, maybe due to the
small sample size.
In a study with hypertensive subjects, Mulatero and
colleagues analyzed the frequency of the -344 T/C poly-
morphism and its relationship with aldosterone plasma
levels, finding that a stronger expression of the C allele
was related to higher levels of this hormone.7 In another
study performed in individuals with high blood pres-
sure, Lim and colleagues analyzed the aldosterone/renin
ratio and its relationship to AS gene polymorphisms,
describing how the presence of the T allele in the -344
T/C polymorphism and the C allele in the int 2 W/C pol-
ymorphism was accompanied by a higher aldosterone/
renin ratio.14 In contrast, Tamaki and colleagues reported
that the C allele in the -344 T/C polymorphism was
associated with a higher aldosterone/renin ratio in
Japanese patients.15
On the other hand, Nejatizadeh and colleagues studied
the relationship of AS gene polymorphisms, plasmatic
activity of renin and serum levels of aldosterone with the
risk for developing hypertension.16 They found the T
(-344 T/C) C (int 2 W/C) was a risk haplotype for the
development of hypertension, as well as for increased
serum aldosterone levels and higher aldosterone/renin
ratios. In this study, no relationship was found between
higher levels of aldosterone and development of post-
transplant hypertension.
It is also important to point out that in our study we
observed higher uric acid serum levels in the CIN group.
Recent studies have considered the role of uric acid in
endothelial dysfunction; with plasmatic levels of over 6 and
9 mg/dl, causing cellular aging and death, respectively.
Implicated mechanisms are activation of local oxidative
stress and over-regulation of some RAS components.17
These effects can be reduced through pharmacological
blockade of the RAS. Because hyperuricemia is considered
an independent cardiovascular risk factor, as well as a fac-
tor implicated in progression of kidney diseases,18 there is a
need to perform more studies to assess this aspect, with the
possibility of considering it as an early marker of vascular
damage associated with CI administration.
When assessing renal histological alterations related to
CI toxicity, we did not find any relationship between the
frequencies of different genotypes and a higher degree of
CIN defined by the presence of hyaline nodules and/or
arteriolopathy. However, when we analyzed the degree of
interstitial fibrosis, it was discovered that patients with the
conversion homozygous genotype (CC) of int 2 W/C
showed a greater degree of interstitial fibrosis, compared to
the WW and WC genotypes (p=0.03). In this case, 42.9%
and 14.3% of the patients with CC genotype presented
grade II and grade III interstitial fibrosis. This result
suggests that the main pro-fibrotic pathways may be

dependent on other mediators different from aldosterone,
such as TGF. However, this association should be made
with caution due to the small sample size studied and
because 28.6% of the patients with CC genotype showed no
fibrosis. Additional studies in a large number of patients
could help to define the true role of this marker in intersti-
tial fibrosis. It also should be mentioned that in cases with
the CC genotype of int 2 W/C polymorphism, we observed
a tendency for higher diastolic blood pressure and proteinu-
ria at the time the biopsy was taken, higher levels of
serum creatinine a year after graft biopsy, a lower glomerular
filtration rate at 37 months of follow-up, as well as an
adverse metabolic profile manifested by a higher body
mass index and serum glucose (data not shown).
Likewise, we found that the presence of the CC genotype
of int 2 W/C polymorphism was related in a non-significant
manner with a higher degree of tubular atrophy and arteri-
olopathy. This suggests that patients with this genetic profile
could be at greater risk for accelerated deterioration of renal
function, which should be assessed in future studies.
Regarding the int 2 W/C polymorphism, the CC genotype
was related to a higher degree of interstitial fibrosis and the
WW genotype was related to higher CI serum levels. The
frequency of the specific polymorphisms studied was not
related to plasma aldosterone levels or development of CIN.
However, our data are preliminary due to the study sample
size and additional studies in a larger number of individuals
and in other populations could help define the true role of
these polymorphisms as risk factors for developing CIN.
