Background and Objectives: The prevalence of trichomoniasis in
the general population of the United States is unknown. This study
provides the first population-based prevalence estimates of trichomo-
niasis among young adults in the United States.
Methods: The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(Add Health) is an ongoing prospective cohort study. In a cross-sectional
analysis of Wave III of Add Health (N  12,449), we determined the
prevalence of trichomoniasis using a polymerase chain reaction assay.
Results: The estimated overall prevalence of trichomoniasis in U.S.
young adults was 2.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8­2.7%). The
prevalence was slightly higher among women (2.8%; 95% CI, 2.2­
3.6%) than men (1.7%; 95% CI, 1.3­2.2%). The prevalence increased
with age and varied by region, with the south having the highest
prevalence (2.8%; 95% CI, 2.2­3.5%). The prevalence was highest
among black women (10.5%; 95% CI, 8.3­13.3%) and lowest among
white women (1.1%; 95% CI, 0.8­1.6%). Among men, the prevalence
was highest among Native Americans (4.1%; 95% CI, 0.4­29.3%) and
blacks (3.3%; 95% CI, 2.2­4.9%), and lowest among white men
(1.3%; 95% CI, 0.9­1.8%).
Conclusions: Trichomoniasis is moderately prevalent among the
general U.S. population of young adults and disturbingly high among
certain racial/ethnic groups.
TRICHOMONIASIS, CAUSED BY THE PROTOZOAN
Trichomonas vaginalis, is manifested by vaginitis and cervicitis in
women and urethritis in men.1­3 Although many persons with
trichomoniasis are mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic,1,4 the
infection is associated with substantial morbidity. The total direct
medical cost associated with trichomoniasis is estimated to be
$34.2 million annually.5
A potential role of trichomoniasis in amplifying HIV transmis-
sion also has been identified.6­9 Inflammation associated with
trichomoniasis may facilitate HIV transmission.10­12 Among
women, trichomoniasis increases the number of HIV-receptive
cells in the genital tract.13 T. vaginalis has a direct cytopathic
effect in vitro and causes punctate microhemorrhages, which could
facilitate HIV acquisition.14 Finally, up to 20% of HIV infections
might be attributable to T. vaginalis infection in populations in
which both infections are prevalent.9
Despite these important consequences of trichomoniasis, our cur-
rent understanding of the prevalence of trichomoniasis is largely
limited to clinical settings and special populations. Among women,
the prevalence of trichomoniasis has ranged from 3% in adolescent15
and student health16 clinics to over 45% in incarcerated women.17,18
Among men attending sexually transmitted disease clinics, the prev-
alence of trichomoniasis has ranged from 3%19 to 12%.20
The prevalence of trichomoniasis in the general population of
the United States is unknown. The National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health (Add Health) provides the first opportunity to
examine the prevalence of trichomoniasis in the United States
among young adults outside of the clinic setting. Using a nucleic
acid amplification test of urine samples, we provide prevalence
estimates of trichomoniasis for young adult men and women by
region, age, and race/ethnicity.

ducted cross-sectional analyses using the most recent round of data
collection of Add Health, Wave III (April 2, 2001, to May 9,
2002). The University of North Carolina Institutional Review
Board approved all study procedures.
The Add Health study design has been described in detail
elsewhere.22,23 Briefly, the study used school-based sampling to
obtain a nationally representative sample of adolescents in grades
7 through 12 in 1994­1995. To increase the precision of estimates
within certain racial/ethnic groups, blacks with college-educated
parents and certain Latino and Asian subgroups were oversampled.
In Wave III, original Wave I participants were recontacted and
invited to participate.
Interviews and Specimen Collection
After obtaining informed consent for the interview, participants
were interviewed in their home or other convenient location.
Responses to the questionnaire were entered directly into a com-
puter. Potentially sensitive questions such as sexual behavior were
administered using computer-assisted self-interview (CASI).
After completion of the interview, consent was obtained to test
urine for sexually transmitted infections. Participants received a
$10 incentive for providing a urine specimen. A toll-free number
was provided to participants to call for chlamydia and gonorrhea
test results. Because the trichomonas assay used in this study has
not undergone evaluation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administra-
tion for diagnostic use, results of the trichomonas assay were not
provided to the participants.
Interviewers provided the participants with verbal instructions
for urine collection and a 30-mL specimen container with a mark
placed at 15 mL. The target volume for testing was 15 to 20 mL
of first-void urine. After collection, the specimens were maintained
at approximately 4°C until shipped by overnight courier to the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
We used a urine-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
assay for detection of T. vaginalis.24,25 Briefly, urine specimens
were processed within 2 days of receipt using the Amplicor
CT/NG Urine Specimen Prep kit (Roche Diagnostic Systems,
Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Urine preps were stored at 70°C until PCR was performed. For
PCR, 50 L of thawed urine prep was used as a template in a
reaction containing 40 pmol each of primers TVK3 and TVK7
(digoxigenin-labeled).26 PCR products were detected using the
PCR DIG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection
kit (Roche Diagnostic Systems) with the biotinylated TVK probe
and ELISA controls as described previously.24,25 Based on the
published receiver-operating characteristic analyses of the test,
ELISA absorbance values of 3.0 for female specimens24 and 2.0
for male specimens25 were used as cutoffs. A more detailed de-
scription of Add Health trichomonas testing is available else-
where.27 A separate aliquot of urine was prepared and tested for
Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae using the li-
gase chain reaction assay (Abbott Laboratories), as described
previously.23
Statistical Analyses
Analyses were conducted using Stata, version 7.0 (Stata Corp.,
College Station, TX). Prevalences were estimated with 95% con-
fidence intervals. Prevalence ratios with 95% confidence intervals
were estimated using Poisson regression for survey data. Preva-
lence ratios provide a measure of the relative occurrence of tricho-
moniasis across subgroups. To ensure appropriate point estimates
and confidence intervals, all analyses incorporated poststratifica-
tion weights, stratification, and primary sampling units to account
for the complex survey design of Add Health.28
Assessment of Test Performance and Nonresponse Biases
We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of 2
potential sources of bias of the prevalence estimates for T. vagi-
nalis: 1) test performance and 2) nonresponse. To assess the
potential impact of test imperfection on the prevalence estimates,
we present the data from a realistic estimate of test performance
(sensitivity  0.889, specificity  0.99). We also assessed pub-
lished estimates of sensitivity (men: 0.889, women: 0.908) and
specificity (0.934 [women], 0.945 [men]) of the PCR assay, which
likely underestimate specificity.24,25 These analyses were per-
formed in conjunction with the assessment of the effects of non-
response.
In Wave III of Add Health, nonresponse bias is a potential
concern. Of the original Wave I study population, 6% refused
participation and 19% could not be located or were unable to
participate for other reasons. Among the population enrolled, 13%
did not have a urine specimen available for T. vaginalis testing.
This nonresponse can potentially bias the prevalence estimates
under 2 conditions. First, if the response rate varies by an observed
attribute such as race or sex, which is associated with prevalence,
the estimates may be biased. We used poststratification weights
developed by the Add Health research team to ensure the proper
race and sex distribution to minimize this potential bias. Second,
the prevalence estimates may be biased if the nonrespondents have
a different pattern of prevalence from respondents with similar
observed attributes. In this circumstance, an unobserved attribute
may influence both survey participation and level of risk. We
addressed this second potential source of nonresponse bias through
sensitivity analysis using the method described by Brookmeyer
and Gail and as previously described for estimates of chlamydial
infection prevalence in Add Health.23,29 We present results from 2
estimates of a prevalence ratio, P, 0.5 and 2.0, reflecting the
circumstances in which the persons with missing assays are one
half and twice as likely to have T. vaginalis infection.
Results
Characteristics of the Study Population
Of the 18,924 participants in the weighted nationally represen-
tative sample of Wave I of Add Health, 14,322 (75.7%) were
identified and agreed to participate in Wave III. Of these, 1130
(7.9%) refused to provide a urine specimen, 226 (1.6%) were
unable to provide a specimen, and 517 (3.6%) specimens could not
be processed because of shipping or laboratory problems. Thus,
12,449 (86.9%; 65.8% of Wave I participants) specimens were
available for T. vaginalis testing.
The study sample, including only those with T. vaginalis results,
comprised 5916 males (47.5%) and 6533 females (52.5%, Table
1). Most participants (54.3%) were white with substantial repre-
sentation of Latinos (16.3%), blacks (21.5%), and Asians (7.0%).
Native Americans (0.9%) were a small proportion of the study
sample. The mean age of the study sample was 22.0 years (stan-
dard deviation 1.8 years).
Prevalence of Trichomoniasis
The estimated prevalence of trichomoniasis in young adults in
the United States was 2.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8­
2.7%), based on this nationally representative sample. Women
(2.8%) were more likely to be infected than men (1.7%; prevalence
ratio: 1.64; 95% CI, 1.25­2.15). The prevalence of trichomoniasis
in the south (2.8%) was 2.01 (95% CI, 1.10­3.65) times higher
than in the west (1.4%).

MILLER ET AL.
The prevalence of trichomoniasis varied significantly by age
(Table 2). Among males, the prevalence was less than 1% among
18 to 20 year olds (0.8%; 95% CI, 0.4­1.4%), but greater than 2%
in men 25 years and older (2.8%; 95% CI, 1.4­5.3%). A similar
pattern was seen among women, but the prevalence was consid-
erably higher. Among women 20 years or younger, the prevalence
was 2.2% (95% CI, 1.4­3.5%) and in women 25 years or older, the
prevalence was 6.1% (95% CI, 3.5­10.2%).
Trichomoniasis was more than 5 times more prevalent among
blacks (6.9%; 95% CI, 5.4­8.8%; prevalence ratio: 5.85; 95% CI,
4.13­8.29) as compared with whites (1.2%; 95% CI, 0.9­1.5). The
prevalence was also high in Native Americans (4.1%; 95% CI,
0.8­18.0), although this estimate was imprecise. Intermediate
prevalences were observed in Latinos (2.1%) and Asians (1.8%).
Considering gender and race, the prevalence of trichomoniasis
was highest among black (10.5%; 95% CI, 8.3­13.3%) and Native
American (4.2%; 95% CI, 0.6­25.3%) women (Table 3). The
prevalence among black women was nearly 10 times higher than
the prevalence among white women (1.1%; 95% CI, 0.8­1.6%;
prevalence ratio: 9.54; 95% CI, 6.19­14.72) Among men, the
prevalence of trichomoniasis was also highest in blacks (3.3%;
95% CI, 2.2­4.9%) and Native Americans (4.1%; 95% CI, 0.4­
29.3%). White men (1.3%; 95% CI, 0.9­1.8%) had the lowest
prevalence of trichomoniasis.
At the time of the interview, the majority of infections were
asymptomatic. Among men with trichomoniasis, only 2.3% (95%
CI, 0.3­14.8%) reported urethral discharge or dysuria. Similarly,
2.0% (95% CI, 0.7­5.8%) of women with trichomoniasis reported
vaginal discharge or dysuria.
A substantial overlap of trichomoniasis with chlamydial infec-
tion was observed. Although the overall prevalence of chlamydial
infection was 4.2% in this population,23 among persons with
trichomoniasis, the prevalence of chlamydial infection was 12.7%
(95% CI, 8.4­18.7%). This overlap was most pronounced for
women with trichomoniasis, in whom the prevalence of chlamyd-
ial infection was 17.2% (95% CI, 11.4­25.0%). In men with
trichomoniasis, the prevalence of chlamydial infection was 5.6%
(95% CI, 2.2­13.7%).
Sensitivity Analyses
To assess the potential impact of nonresponse and diagnostic
test performance on the prevalence estimates for trichomoniasis,
we conducted several sensitivity analyses (Table 4).

MILLER ET AL.
To provide a direct estimate of the potential effect of nonre-
sponse bias, we estimated the prevalence under different nonre-
sponse conditions without considering test performance (Table 4,
top). If persons without urine specimens were missing at random,
the prevalence estimate is minimally affected (2.3%). If the prev-
alence of T. vaginalis infection was twice as high among persons
without a urine specimen as among those with a urine specimen
(P  2.0), the overall estimate for T. vaginalis infection would
increase to 3.2%. If the prevalence of T. vaginalis infection was
half as great among nonresponders (P  0.5), the overall preva-
lence would decrease to 1.8%.
We then examined estimates under conditions that corrected for
expected test performance (sensitivity  0.889, specificity  0.99;
Table 4, bottom). In this circumstance, estimates were slightly
lower than those obtained with adjustment for nonresponse alone
(Table 4, top). However, estimates for blacks and Native Ameri-
cans, especially for women, changed relatively little.
Discussion
Add Health provides the first national estimates of the preva-
lence of trichomoniasis in the United States. We observed a high
prevalence of this protozoan infection among specific demo-
graphic subgroups, including blacks and Native Americans. The
prevalence was intermediate among Latinos and Asians and lowest
among whites. The prevalence was higher among women and,
generally, increased with age. We also observed a substantial
overlap between chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis, suggest-
ing the potential for common sexual networks.
Unlike chlamydial infection and gonorrhea, reporting of diag-
noses of trichomoniasis to health departments is not required.
Therefore, previous data regarding the prevalence of this infection
in the United States are limited. Most prevalence estimates were
obtained in clinical settings using wet preparations, a relatively
insensitive test. Many studies included women only. In these
studies, the prevalence of trichomoniasis was generally much
higher, often 10% to 30%,15,30­32 than we observed in the general
population using a more sensitive PCR assay. This discrepancy is
largely expected based on the nature of the study populations.
Many clinic-based studies included primarily symptomatic women
typically at high risk for trichomoniasis and other sexually trans-
mitted infections.15 In contrast, Add Health provides an estimate
among primarily asymptomatic women in the general population
without requiring presentation to a clinic.
The disparity in the prevalence of trichomoniasis between ra-
cial/ethnic groups is particularly worrisome, because the estimates
are population-based. Racial/ethnic disparities have been observed
previously in clinic-based studies.17,33­35 Disparities in clinic-
based estimates are often the result of differences in health-seeking
behavior or testing strategies. In contrast, all eligible persons in
Add Health were tested. Thus, these disparities appear to be real
and cannot be easily explained by selection or other forms of bias.
Future efforts will be necessary to attempt to identify potential
explanations for these differences.
The two most significant potential biases in these data are
selection bias related to the study sample and measurement error
associated with test performance. Wave III of Add Health captured
76% of the original study population and an additional 10% did not
have urine specimens for testing. Much of the potential bias, at
least in terms of broad demographic categories, is accounted for in
the poststratification weights created for use with Wave III of Add
Health. These weights ensure that the current study sample pro-
vides an appropriate representation of the target U.S. population.
Furthermore, the magnitude of the bias as a result of loss to follow
up and nonresponse in Wave III Add Health data appears to be
small.36
Within the study sample, systematic differences between those
for whom specimens were available and those without specimens
could also bias the prevalence estimates. For example, if persons
who did not have specimens available had lower prevalence, then
our estimates would be high. However, nonresponse seems to have
a relatively small effect on most of the prevalence estimates based
on our sensitivity analysis (Table 4, top).
Test performance is another potential source of error in our
estimates. We used a newly developed PCR assay to identify T.
vaginalis in the urine specimens of our study population.24,25 Urine
may not be the ideal specimen for identification of trichomoniasis,
potentially leading to underestimation of the prevalence in this
group.37 Despite this limitation, this assay is a substantial advance
over previously available diagnostic methods such as culture and
wet preparation. This study would not have been logistically
feasible if culture and wet preparations were required. In addition,
the PCR assay has substantially increased sensitivity as compared
with the traditional tests. Indeed, the low sensitivity of culture and
wet preparations is problematic for the assessment of the specific-
ity of the PCR assay.24,25 When we used the published estimates of
sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay in our sensitivity
analyses, the prevalence of trichomoniasis was 0 for many
subgroups (data not shown). This strongly suggests that the spec-
ificity of the PCR assay is actually higher than the published
reports. Using plausible estimates to correct for PCR test perfor-
mance, we observed some reduction in prevalence for the lowest
prevalence groups, as expected. However, estimates for blacks and
Native Americans were changed only minimally.
The prevalence of trichomoniasis is sufficiently high to raise
concerns about the potential impact on trichomonas-associated
morbidity. Trichomoniasis is more than just a "nuisance infec-
tion." T. vaginalis exerts a direct cytopathic effect in vitro and
recruits HIV-receptive cells to the genital tract, which may in-
crease the risk of HIV acquisition for women.13,14 In men, symp-
tomatic infection with T. vaginalis has been shown to increase the
HIV viral load in semen 6-fold.38 Whether this infection increases
seminal HIV viral load in asymptomatic men is not known.
However, 60% of men in rural Tanzania with asymptomatic tricho-
moniasis demonstrated a positive leukocyte esterase dipstick,39
suggesting the presence of inflammation.
This potential association of trichomoniasis with increased
transmission of and increased susceptibility to HIV infection is
particularly concerning for this population of sexually active
young adults. Among women aged 15 to 19 years, the incidence of
HIV has increased.40 Furthermore, HIV increased in women aged
20 to 25 years as a result of increasing heterosexual transmission.41
The HIV epidemic has increasingly involved young adult hetero-
sexuals, emphasizing the need for reduction of modifiable risk
factors, including sexually transmitted infections. The potential for
overlap of trichomoniasis and HIV infection networks is particu-
larly strong in blacks and in the southern region of the United
States.
In summary, the prevalence of trichomoniasis in young adults in
the United States is moderately high. The minimal attention given
to trichomoniasis in screening and reporting may contribute to this
high prevalence. In the past, the lack of convenient, highly accu-
rate tests has limited the potential for screening. The development
of T. vaginalis assays for urine24,25 and self-collected vaginal
swabs42 should facilitate screening if these tests can be developed
for widespread use. Because the potential consequences of this
infection are significant, greater efforts are needed to reduce the
prevalence. Future work must also address the marked disparity of
