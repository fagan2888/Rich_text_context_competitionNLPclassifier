Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors have been implicated in various measures of nicotine depen-
dence. In this paper, we present findings from an exploratory study of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in the CHRNB3 and CHRNA6 genes with tobacco and alcohol phenotypes, including frequency of
use and three subjective response factors occurring shortly after initiation of use. Subjects were 1056 ethni-
cally diverse adolescents ascertained from clinical and community settings. The most significant associ-
ations were found between two CHRNB3 SNPs (rs4950 and rs13280604) and the three subjective response
factors to initial tobacco use. These findings were replicated in a separate community sample of 1524 families
participating in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Both CHRNB3 SNPs were found to be
associated with similar measures of subjective response to tobacco. These results indicate that early subjec-
tive response to nicotine may be a valuable endophenotype for genetic studies aimed at uncovering genes
contributing to nicotine use and addiction.
INTRODUCTION
Tobacco and alcohol use among adolescents and young adults is
a pervasive public health issue, with serious economic, medical
and social consequences. Tobacco use is responsible for 20%
of preventable deaths in the United States (Centers for Disease
Control, 2002) and alcohol is the leading cause of injury
related deaths in individuals under 21 (National Institute of
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2005).
Genetics of alcohol and tobacco use
Alcohol and tobacco use, abuse and dependence are complex
traits caused by a combination of genetic and environmental
factors (1­4). Both genetic and shared environmental influ-
ences contributed to smoking status in a cohort of Australian
twins, and monozygotic twin correlations for age of onset of
smoking were higher than dizygotic twin correlations (5). Her-
itability estimates of 80% for regular tobacco use and 60% for
nicotine dependence (6) and 64% for alcohol dependence (5)
have been obtained from twin studies. In addition, it has
been shown that alcohol dependence and smoking were trans-
mitted within families and that common and drug-specific
influences were factors in this transmission, suggesting that
there may be a common factor in nicotine and alcohol depen-
dence (7). Likewise, twin studies suggest evidence for
common genetic influences on the use and problem use of
alcohol and tobacco (8­13).
Nicotinic receptors
Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) are the
principle target of nicotine. The genes encoding nAChR

mRNAs have been categorized into two subfamilies composed
of nine alpha (a2­a10) and three beta (b2­b4) subunits. In
combination, both subunit types contribute to unique pharma-
cological and physiological responses involved in drug
exposure, neurotransmission, and the integration of sensory
information. There are two main classes of nAChR subtypes:
those that are sensitive to aBungarotoxin (aBtx), consisting of
the a7­a10 subunits, and those that are insensitive to aBtx,
made up of a2­6 and b2­4. The receptor binding site is
located between two identical subunits in the homomeric a7
receptors, or between a and b subunit in the heteromeric
receptors. Different combinations of a and b subunits in het-
eromeric receptors contribute to differences in the pharmaco-
logical properties of the receptor binding site. A variety of
different combinations of a and b subunits have been
observed, with differing stoichiometries (i.e. two a and three
b or three a and two b), which have been shown to be differ-
entially expressed in different brain regions under a variety of
conditions (such as low temperature or exposure to nicotine).
The a5 and b3 subunits carry neither type of binding site and
are thought to contribute to receptor targeting, localization and
receptor permeability (14).
Some of the known nAChRs are expressed on cell bodies,
but most are expressed on nerve terminals where they modu-
late the release of neurotransmitters including glutamate,
gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), serotonin, norepi-
nephrine and dopamine (15). Identifying the subunit compo-
sitions of the nAChRs that influence dopamine release has
been of marked interest given that dopamine seems to play
an important role in modulating the reinforcing effects of vir-
tually all drugs of abuse, including nicotine and alcohol
(16,17). Recent studies using a4, a5, b2 and b3 null mutant
mice coupled with immunological (18) and functional (19)
assays indicate that dopaminergic nerve terminals may
express as many as four distinct nAChR subtypes: a4b2,
a4a5b2, a4a6b2b3 and a6b2b3.
Several studies have examined the nAChR genes and
smoking and nicotine dependence. SNPs in the CHRNA4
gene have been associated with tobacco related behaviors
(20­22). Most studies of the CHRNB2 have not found evi-
dence for an association (21­24), but two recent reports
have shown a possible role for this gene in age of initiation
of smoking in women (25), and in smoking and alcohol sub-
jective response phenotypes (20). Other individual SNPs in
several nAChR genes have been explored for possible inter-
action affects with a variety of background factors, psycho-
logical characteristics and neurocognitive measures, but
these findings must be considered exploratory because they
were identified after multiple tests and have not been repli-
cated (25,26). The CHRNB3 and CHRNA5 genes have
emerged as strong candidates for nicotine dependence in two
recent reports of a genome wide association and a high-
throughput candidate gene survey (27,28).
In any genetic study, determining an appropriate phenotype
is crucial to the analyses, but it can be difficult to determine in
advance which phenotype might be more likely to be associ-
ated with a particular gene or specific SNP. Here we have
taken the approach of using one sample of subjects to
explore multiple alcohol and tobacco phenotypes for possible
associations with SNPs in the CHRNB3 and CHRNA6 genes,
then using a second sample to replicate our findings. In the
exploratory study, we tested conventional phenotypes of
alcohol and tobacco behaviors (i.e. age of initiation, number
of days used in past 6 months, typical pattern of use, peak
use, frequency of use, sensitivity and dependence/abuse) and
antecedent phenotypes (subjective effects) for associations
with four SNPs in the CHRNB3 gene and three SNPs in the
CHRNA6 in a population of ethnically diverse young adults.
Based on findings in this first sample, we conducted a replica-
tion study of specific SNPs and a single phenotype using a
family-based, independently ascertained community sample.
RESULTS
Demographics (CADD)
One thousand and fifty six individuals met the inclusion cri-
teria for this study. Seventy four percent are Caucasian (n ¼
760), 16% are Hispanic (n ¼ 169), 4% are African American
(n ¼ 43), and the remainder are `other' (n ¼ 58). The mean
age of the subjects was 18.21+ 1.50 years and 58.1% of the
subjects were male.
Demographics (Add Health)
One thousand five hundred and twenty four families (1445 sib-
pairs and 79 sib-trios) were included with a mean age of
22.4 + 1.7 years and 48% were male. Sixty nine percent of
the families were Caucasian, 20% were African American,
7.7% were Asian, 1.7% were Native American and the
remaining 1.9% were not identified.
Single marker analyses (CADD)
Allele frequencies for SNPs genotyped in the Colorado Center
on Antisocial Drug Dependence (CADD) are presented in
Table 1. All SNPs were in Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium
across all ethnic groups. The three CHRNA6 SNPs had signifi-
cantly different allele frequencies compared to Caucasians:
rs2304297 (x2 ¼ 15.8, df ¼ 2, P , 0.001), rs892413 (x2 ¼
20.4, df ¼ 2, P , 0.0001), rs1072003 (x2 ¼ 22.2, df ¼ 2,
P , 0.0001). There were no ethnic differences in allele fre-
quencies for any of the CHRNB3 SNPs.
CHRNB3. Table 2 summarizes the association results in
CHRNB3 for all of the tobacco phenotypes for the entire
sample adjusted for race. There were no significant associ-
ations with any of the alcohol phenotypes (data not shown).
Several SNPs were associated with the three subjective
factor scores and more detailed analysis of these is presented
in Table 3.
Table 3 shows the statistically significant association results
for individual SNPs and tobacco subjective responses. The
sixth column presents the b estimates from the linear
regression analysis in WHAP. Evidence of association was
found between the CHRNB3 SNPs and the three subjective
factors for tobacco. All four SNPs (rs4950, rs13280604,
hCV25772398 and rs4953) were associated with the adverse
factor for tobacco in the full sample, the most highly signifi-
cant association being with hCV25772398. All four SNPs
Human Molecular Genetics, 2008, Vol. 17, No. 5 725
(rs4950, rs1328064, hCV25772398 and rs4953) were also
associated with the positive factor for tobacco, with rs4950
and rs13280604 being the most significant across the full
sample and two ethnic subgroups. An association was
observed between rs4950, rs13280604 and hCV25772398
and the tobacco negative physical factor, again with rs4950
and rs13280604 being the most significant. Several of these
associations were also present in the Caucasian and Hispanic
subgroups (Table 3).
CHRNA6. Table 4 shows the results for all of the tobacco
measures in CHRNA6 for the entire sample adjusted for
race. The tobacco positive factor showed an association with
rs2304297 in the full sample (P ¼ 0.003) (Table 4). This
association was also seen in the Caucasian group (P ¼ 0.05)
but not in the Hispanic sample (Table 3, bottom). There
were no significant associations with any of the alcohol
measures (data not shown).
Haplotype structure in CADD
The r2 values for the four SNPs within CHRNB3 and three
SNPs within CHRNA6 were calculated using the Haploview
program (29). Figure 1 shows the block structure for both
CHRNB3 and CHRNA6 for the full sample, Caucasians and
Hispanics, using the Gabriel 95% confidence interval and a
minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.04. In the full sample, a
haplotype block was assigned to all four of the CHRNB3
SNPs, with r2 estimates ranging from 0.95 to 1.0. A second
block was assigned to two of the CHRNA6 SNPs, with r2 esti-
mates ranging from 0.91 to 1.0. These block structures are
similar to those available at HapMap for Caucasians. In
CHRNB3, there is a large block across the 50 end of the
gene, but no LD structure is given for the 30 end, likely
because most of the SNPs in that region are quite rare so it
may not be able to be calculated with reliability. For
CHRNA6, there are a few different putative blocks depending
on the algorithm used, as seen in Figure 1.
Haplotype analysis in CADD
CHRNB3. Haplotypes with a frequency less than 1% were
excluded. The b-coefficients for the quantitative traits are
linear regression estimates, while for binary traits, an odds
ratio can be obtained by taking the exponent of the
b-coefficients. The omnibus test compares each estimated
haplotype while controlling all others.
Table 5 shows the omnibus results of the separate haplotype
analysis of the four SNPs in CHRNB3 and the three SNPs in
CHRNA6. In the full sample, the omnibus test was significant
for all three factors and tobacco: adverse (P ¼ 0.02), negative
physical (P ¼ 0.003) and positive (P , 0.01). The Caucasian
subsample was also significant for the tobacco negative phys-
ical factor (P ¼ 0.01) and tobacco positive factor (P ¼ 0.03).
In the Hispanic subsample, the tobacco positive factor
showed a trend toward significance (P ¼ 0.08). There was
also evidence for association between CHRNB3 and
co-occurrence of alcohol and tobacco dependence/abuse in
males (P ¼ 0.046).
Haplotype specific analyses were performed using the ­hs
option in WHAP, which tests each specific haplotype indi-
vidually against all other haplotypes. b-Coefficients and

Haplotype analysis of rs4950­rs13280604­
hCV25772398­rs4953 showed three major haplotypes in the
full sample, Caucasian sample and Hispanic sample
(Table 5). There was an association between the most frequent
haplotype (74.6%), A­A­T­G, and the tobacco adverse
factor in the full sample (b ¼ 20.154, P ¼ 0.04). The G­
G­C­C haplotype (3.8%) was associated with higher factor
scores for the tobacco adverse factor (b ¼ 0.364, P ¼ 0.02).
Estimates in the Caucasian sample were in the same direction
and similar magnitude as the full sample, but did not reach
statistical significance. The A­A­T­G haplotype was associ-
ated with the tobacco negative physical factor in both the full
sample (b ¼ 20.225, P , 0.001) and the Caucasian sample
(b ¼ 20.185, P , 0.001). The G­G­T­G haplotype
(21.6%) was also associated with the tobacco negative phys-
ical factor in the full sample (b ¼ 0.215, P , 0.001) and in
the Caucasian sample (b ¼ 0.212, P , 0.001).
All three haplotypes were associated with the tobacco posi-
tive factor. The A­A­T­G haplotype (b ¼ 20.184, P ,
0.01) was associated with lower factor scores of the tobacco
positive factor, while the G­G­T­G (b ¼ 0.132, P , 0.05)
and G­G­C­C haplotypes (b ¼ 0.294, P , 0.05) were
associated with higher factor scores. In the Caucasian
sample, the same directional association was observed with
the A­A­T­G haplotype (b ¼ 20.178, P , 0.01) and the
G­G­T­G haplotype (b ¼ 0.150, P , 0.05). Likewise, the
G­G­C­C haplotype was associated with higher factor
scores in the Hispanic sample (b ¼ 0.507, P , 0.05).
CHRNA6. In the CHRNA6 gene, the omnibus test was signifi-
cant in the full sample and the Hispanic sample for the tobacco
positive factor (P ¼ 0.003; P ¼ 0.03, respectively). Haplotype
analysis of rs2304297­rs892413­rs1072003 revealed five
haplotypes in the full sample and four in the Caucasian and
Hispanic samples (Table 5). In the full sample, the most fre-
quent C­A­C haplotype (71.6%) was associated with lower
factor scores (b ¼ 20.172, P , 0.001) and the G­A­C hap-
lotype (frequency: 3.4%) associated with higher factor scores
(b ¼ 0.482, P , 0.001) for the tobacco positive factor. The
most frequent C­A­C haplotype in Caucasians was also
associated with lower factor scores (74%) (b ¼ 20.130,
P , 0.05) (Table 5).
Single marker analyses (Add Health)
Allele frequencies for the four SNPs genotyped in the Add
Health subjects are presented in Table 1. All SNPs were in
Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) within each ethnic
group, although there were significant differences in allele fre-
quencies between the two major subgroups (Caucasians and
African Americans), where in fact the minor allele is different
(Table 1). These differences are consistent with allele frequen-
cies available in the public SNP databases. All results pre-
sented included the full sample of 1524 families, because
the family based approach used by Family Based Association
Test-Principal Components (FBAT-PC) to test for association
inherently controls for population stratification. However,

when all analyses were restricted to Caucasians, a similar
pattern of results emerged.
FBAT-PC was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data
to a single maximally heritable principal component (PC) for
each SNP and test for association. Our a priori hypothesis,
based on the CADD results, was that SNPs rs4950 and
rs13280604 would be significantly associated with the subjec-
tive effects PC. We had also detected modest evidence for an
association with rs2304297, but no evidence for rs892413.
Results from the FBAT-PC analyses are presented in
Table 6. The most highly significant SNP was rs13280604
(P ¼ 0.011), followed by rs4950 (P ¼ 0.043), and rs2304297
(P ¼ 0.053). There was no evidence for association with
rs892413 (P ¼ 0.870). Note that this is a total of only four
individual tests; one specific hypothesis was tested for each
SNP.
Figure 2A and B show the correlation of each subjective
effect item with the PC derived for SNPs rs13280604 and
rs2304297. In both cases, the top three items are `dizziness,'
`pleasurable buzz or rush,' and `relaxed.' However, `cough-
ing' and `unpleasant sensations' drop from correlations of
0.5 and 0.4 for the PC phenotype associated with
rs13280604 to nearly 0 for the rs2304297-associated pheno-
type.
DISCUSSION
Given the overwhelming evidence that shared genetic factors
play a role in nicotine and alcohol abuse and dependence,
we examined several tobacco and alcohol phenotypes for
associations with SNPs in the a6 and b3 nAChR subunit
genes in an effort to examine potential common pathways.
The results of our exploratory study in the CADD sample
suggested that SNPs in the a6/b3 gene cluster are associated
with early subjective reactions to tobacco.
The four CHRNB3 SNPs tested (rs4950, rs13280604,
hCV25772398 and rs4953) showed an association with the
tobacco adverse and positive subjective factors and three
SNPs (rs4950, rs13280604 and hCV25772398) with the
tobacco negative physical factor in the total sample. There
was suggestive evidence for an association with the
CHRNA6 SNP rs2304297 and the positive subjective effects
factor. The most robust results appeared to be with the two
SNPs in the 50 end of CHRNB3 (rs4950 and rs13280604),
which consistently showed significance in the Caucasian
subgroup. This may be related to the fact that the other two
CHRNB3 SNPs are relatively rare, providing less power to
detect an effect and that SNPs genotyped for the 30 end of
the gene have not completely saturated LD in that region. It
appears that the A­A alleles in these two SNPs act overall
to reduce subjective responses, while the G­G alleles are
associated with increasing response (i.e. answering `yes' to
one of the items on the questionnaire).
There were no significant associations between the patterns
of use phenotypes for either tobacco or alcohol and the
CHRNB3 or CHRNA6 SNPs. However, since the three sub-
jective factors themselves are highly associated with tobacco
dependence, it is possible that subjective effects may act as
a mediator between the genotype and dependence.
In the Add Health sample, only four SNPs, the two
CHRNB3 SNPs with the most robust results in the CADD
sample (rs4950 and rs13280604), a CHRNA6 SNP with
suggestive evidence (rs2304297), and a CHRNA6 SNP
with no evidence of association (rs892413), were examined.
Solid evidence for an association with all three of the puta-
tively associated SNPs was detected using a PC approach
incorporating nine subjective effects items. Secondary ana-
lyses examining the correlation of individual items suggest
that `dizziness,' `pleasurable buzz or rush,' and `relaxed'
are subjective effects that contribute significantly to the
association of all three SNPs. However, there may be differ-
ences in how some of the other items (coughing and unplea-
sant sensations) are `loading' onto the two SNPs in
CHRNB3 compared to the SNP in CHRNA6. This is in
agreement with the pattern of results detected in the
CADD sample, suggesting that perhaps both genes are
important in mediating subjective response, and that mul-

tiple SNPs or combinations of these SNPs may interact to
modulate behavior.
Animal model reward systems
Studies conducted using mice (30), rats (31) and monkeys (32)
indicate that a6 and b3-containing nicotinic receptors
(a4a6b2b3 and a6b2b3) are expressed almost exclusively
in dopaminergic nerve terminals. It is clear that dopaminergic
neurons in the medial forebrain bundle (MFB), particularly
those that originate in the ventral tegmental area and terminate
in the nucleus accumbens play vital roles in regulating reward
systems in the brain (33,34). Rats and monkeys will actively
press a lever or perform an operant response to obtain stimu-
lation from electrodes implanted in the MFB. The rewarding
effects of MFB stimulation are enhanced by virtually all
drugs of abuse, including nicotine, and are attenuated by
doses of dopamine receptor antagonists that do not disrupt
behavior (35). These findings are consistent with the obser-
vations that pretreatment with dopamine receptor antagonists
will decrease intravenous self-administration of nicotine in
rats (36). It may be that the significant associations that
were detected between the CHRNB3 and CHRNA6 genetic
markers and subjective effects reflect influences of a6/
b3-containing receptors on the major brain reward pathways.
Potential function of the CHRNB3 and CHRNA6
studied SNPs
Using the publicly available program Transcription Element
Search System (TESS; URL: http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/
tess), we investigated the putative transcription factors that
could bind to the genomic regions of the two CHRNB3
SNPs implicated in this study. The 50-UTR region of the
CHRNB3 (exon 1) displayed a rich variety of putative tran-
scription factor binding sites, and the rs4950 SNP located in
this region appears to be in close proximity to the binding
site of the ubiquitous trans-activator AP1 (ID: T00029). In
view of these potential transcriptional activation-binding
sites surrounding the variations examined in the CHRNB3
locus, it is possible to speculate that these SNPs may have
an effect on the expression of the b3 receptor subunits. For
SNP rs2304297 in CHRNA6, TESS identified a considerable
match to a COUP-TF1 factor, a retinoic acid response factor
(id; T00149), located about 50 bp downstream of this SNP.
The significance of these results is unknown, but one possi-
bility is that nAChR subunit gene expression may be modu-
lated by retinoic acid-mediated actions, for which there is
some support in the literature (37,38).
Strengths and limitations
There are several strengths and limitations to this study. Both
samples included large samples. A wide range of information
about smoking and alcohol behaviors were collected, allowing
comprehensive analyses in the original sample. However,
seven individual SNPs and a total of 19 different phenotypes
were tested, and so Type I errors are likely to have occurred
in the first analysis. While we did not correct for multiple
testing, all significant P-values were derived from empirical
tests based on 500 permutations. However, given the fact
that we were able to replicate the association with three
specific SNPs and early subjective response to nicotine in a

completely separate population-based sample, the issue of
multiple testing in the first sample is addressed.
In addition, this study relied on retrospective reports of
initial subjective responses to tobacco or alcohol among
those who had already met frequency of use criterion.
However, many studies have shown that adolescent self-
reports of substance use are reliable and valid (39,40).
Summary
We found evidence for association between allelic variants in
the CHRNB3 and CHRNA6 genes and early subjective reac-
tions to tobacco use in a selected sample and in an indepen-
dently ascertained population-based sample. The PC analysis
used in the Add Health study suggests that three individual

items (dizziness, pleasurable buzz or rush and relaxed) are
major contributors to the association with these genes.
However, since the three subjective effects factors identified
in the first sample are highly correlated with each other (P
, 0.001), it suggests that strong reactions from tobacco use
in general are likely to be associated with these genes. This
is consistent with our previous finding of an association
between an SNP in the CHRNB2 gene and alcohol subjective
response in this same population (20).
The results from this study add to the growing literature
examining the role of nicotinic receptors and nicotine depen-
dence phenotypes. There have been previous reports of associ-
ations between CHRNA4 haplotypes and smoking-related
phenotypes (20­22), and limited evidence for an association
with CHRNB2 (20,25). However, the recent findings from a
large genome wide association (27) and candidate gene
study (28) have provided additional support for the importance
of these receptors and nicotine dependence. Future studies
should include a more in-depth analysis of these genes by
re-sequencing to identify novel SNPs and provide better cov-
erage of the full variation in the region. Ultimately, molecular
approaches aimed at understanding how these variants may (or
may not) affect gene function will be necessary to improve our
understanding of the complex genetic interactions contributing
to tobacco use behaviors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects (Center for Antisocial Drug Dependence ­ CADD)
One thousand and fifty six individuals were drawn from the
CADD family, twin and adoption samples. Adolescents in
treatment for substance abuse and delinquency were recruited
from the Colorado Adolescent Substance Abuse family study,
a study of the familial transmission of substance abuse and
associated psychopathology. Unselected adolescents were
recruited from the Colorado Twin Registry, a community-
based sample of twins living in Colorado, and the Colorado
Adoption Project, an ongoing, longitudinal adoption study of
the genetic and environmental influences on behavioral, cogni-
tive and emotional development (41).
Twenty-six percent of the sample was drawn from clinical
treatment centers, whereas the remainder was ascertained
from community based centers. All subjects were between
the ages of 17 and 21, and only one subject per family was
included in this study.
Subjects (National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health ­ Add Health)
All subjects were selected from the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Add Health is an
ongoing nationally representative probability based sample
of adolescents in the United States. The current analyses
were conducted among respondents in the sibling-pairs sub-
sample, for which phenotypic data and DNA were available.
A total of 1564 families (1445 sib-pairs and 79 sib-trios),
ages 18.2­27.4 years at the Wave 3 assessment were included
in the final analyses. Information regarding the study design,
sampling strategy and collection of DNA within this sample
is available elsewhere (42). Study protocols were approved
by Intuitional Review Boards (NC and CO, USA), and sub-
jects provided written informed consent.
Assessments
All CADD subjects completed the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview-Substance Abuse Module (43), an
assessment valid for adolescents (39). It asks the number of
times subjects had used alcohol or tobacco. Those who
reported meeting specified thresholds (six or more alcoholic
drinks in your lifetime and/or used tobacco almost every day
for a month) were asked follow-up questions about abuse
and dependence symptoms. Scoring algorithms based on life-
time substance-related problems were used to derive the
number of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
orders 4th Edition (DSM-IV) abuse and dependence symptoms
for tobacco and alcohol. Subjects meeting use criteria also
were asked a series of twenty three questions aimed at asses-
sing the early subjective responses to each drug (44). These
questions were asked as: In the period shortly after you used
tobacco/alcohol, did it make you feel (subjective effect)?, to
which subjects answered yes or no to items such as
`depressed,' `irritable,' `mellow,' `energetic,' `sociable,'
`anxious,' etc (20). Binary variables called `tobacco sensi-
tivity' and `alcohol sensitivity' were created from two items
`nauseous' and `dizzy' such that if the response is `yes' to
either of these items it is coded as 1, otherwise it is coded
0. In addition, a complete description of three factors
(adverse, negative physical and positive) that were identified
using factor analysis of these items is described in a previous
study (20). These three factors, along with the other pheno-
types examined for each drug, are presented in Table 7.

In the Add Health study, subjective experiences to nicotine
exposure were collected from those subjects who reported ever
having smoked a cigarette by young adulthood. Subjects' ret-
rospectively reported whether they had positive and negative
experiences following their first few cigarettes when they
started smoking. A total of nine items (pleasant sensations,
relaxation, a pleasurable rush or buzz, nausea, unpleasant sen-
sations, difficulty inhaling, heart pounding, dizziness and
coughing) were assessed.
Selection of SNPs and genotyping
Candidate polymorphisms for the CHRNA6 and CHRNB3
genes were identified using the Celera Discovery System data-
base and the public database, dbSNP (Table 1). Located on
chromosome 8 at position 8p11.21, CHRNA6 (GeneID:
8973) spans 16.01 kb (Aceview annotation, NCBI Build 35)
and has at least two alternatively spliced transcripts (Fig. 3).
CHRNB3 (GeneID: 1142) is located on chromosome 8 at pos-
ition 8p11.2, spanning 39.99 kb. Six exons can be alternatively
spliced into at least two different transcripts.
Criteria for selection included validation status of the SNP
based on the public dbSNP database and from the Celera Dis-
covery System, MAF greater than 0.10 (if known), and
location in the gene such that the SNPs would be approxi-
mately evenly distributed throughout the gene. The structures
of the CHRNA6 and CHRNB3 genes, and the SNPs selected,
are shown in Figure 3.
Genomic DNA was isolated from buccal cell swabs and pre-
amplified using standard methods (45). Data obtained using
this DNA are of high quality; these methods have been
shown to be reliable for genotyping (46). TaqManw assays
for allelic discrimination (Applied Biosystems) were used to
determine SNP genotypes, per instructions of the manufacturer
under standard conditions using ABI PRISMw 7000 and 7900
instruments. We genotyped the 1056 subjects in the CADD
sample for seven SNPs (rs4950, rs13280604, hCV25772398,
rs4953, rs2304297, rs892413 and rs1072003) and 2612 sub-
jects in the Add Health sample for four SNPs (rs4950,
rs13280604, rs2304297 and rs892413).
Statistical analysis (CADD)
The twenty-three items assessing the subjective responses to
alcohol and tobacco were subjected to initial PC factor analy-
sis using the Statistical Analysis Software (SAS, v. 9.1) PROC
FACTOR command as described previously (20). Three
factors were retained and labeled on the basis of similar symp-
toms: adverse (e.g. depressed and paranoid), negative physical
(e.g. dizzy and nauseous), and positive (e.g. energetic and
sociable) based on the labels used by others (47).
The r2 values between all SNP markers, MAFs and tests for
Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium were calculated using Haplo-
view (29). WHAP was utilized to test the effects of individual
SNPs in a linear regression-based test of association with quan-
titative phenotypes (http://www.broad.mit.edu/personal/shaun/
whap/). Within WHAP haplotypes were also estimated using
SNPHAP (http://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/clayton/software/)
and simultaneously tested for association (48). We found that
haplotypes assigned by WHAP (SNPHAP) and those assigned
by PHASE (20,49) have 99% correspondence. All analyses
were corrected for ethnicity. In WHAP, the three largest ethni-
city groups, Caucasian, Hispanic and African American, were
dummy-coded as three covariates that were included in the
regression model. Since there was strong evidence for differ-
ences in individual SNP frequencies between ethnic groups,
as well as differences in haplotype frequencies, results from a
primary analysis of the full sample, followed by results of ana-
lyses of the two largest ethnic groups, Caucasians and Hispa-
nics, are shown. All reported significant P-values are
empirical values obtained from conducting 500 permutations,
but have not been corrected for multiple testing, although all
of the phenotypes are highly correlated.
Statistical analysis (Add Health)
The statistical package FBAT-PC (50) was used to analyze the
four SNPs genotyped in the Add Health sample with the nine
subjective response items. This approach is based on the com-
bined linkage-association analysis originally described by
Fulker et al. (51) and extends it to incorporate a traditional
PC approach whereby a multivariate series of correlated phe-
notypes are reduced to one, univariate phenotype for testing.
Figure 3. Schematic of CHRNA6 and CHRNB3. Boxes represent exons separated by intronic regions in each gene. In the CADD sample, four SNPs were gen-
otyped in CHRNB3, with their rs numbers and gene locations indicated, where bp provides the number of nucleotide base pairs between each SNP. Three SNPs
were genotyped in CHRNA6.
732 Human Molecular Genetics, 2008, Vol. 17, No. 5
In the context of genetic applications, a lesser-known PC
approach involves maximizing the heritability (52). Using
quantitative traits, this translates to maximizing the variance
of the phenotype that is explained by a particular marker
(i.e. the marker-specific heritability). Extensions of this
approach were developed for family based samples (49) in
the genetic association framework in FBAT-PC where a phe-
notype (a maximally heritable PC) is constructed first using
the between-family information and the phenotype is sub-
sequently tested using the within-family information. In this
study of the Add Health sample, a specific a priori hypothesis
about which SNPs would be most significant with a subjective
effects phenotype was predefined based on the results from the
exploratory study in the CADD.
