Non-technical summary
Banks are exposed to interest rate risk through their function of transforming short-term
deposits into long-term loans. This interest rate risk is visible on the balance sheet as
the maturity mismatch or duration gap (i.e., the difference between the average residual
time to maturity of the assets and the liabilities). Financial intermediation theory stresses
that this risk should be hedged, and banks should instead concentrate on managing credit
risk. An easy way to eliminate interest rate risk is to use interest rate swaps for hedging
purposes.
In our empirical study, we analyze both German universal banks' on-balance-sheet
duration gap and off-balance-sheet interest rate swap use in a simultaneous equation
framework using data from 2000-2011. We derive the following results for banks' interest
rate risk management:
ˇ German universal banks use on-balance-sheet adjustments of the duration gap and
interest rate swaps as substitute strategies for managing their overall interest rate
risk exposure.
ˇ The cost of default makes banks take less risk on the balance sheet and hedge more
of their risk off the balance sheet.
ˇ Banks engage in selective hedging and take more interest rate risk when the yield
curve is steep and term transformation is profitable, but they reduce their interest
rate risk when interbank funding uncertainty makes them vulnerable to the closely
associated liquidity risk.
ˇ For banks with trading books, the decision to use interest rate swaps and the du-
ration gap are statistically independent. For pure banking book intermediaries, the
decision to use interest rate swaps depends on the maturity gap. Only banks that
start using swaps for the first time make a simultaneous decision when they deter-
mine the magnitude of their duration gap and whether to use interest rate swaps.
The extent of interest rate swaps being used always depends on the duration gap.
All in all, our results provide support for the maturity gap being largely determined by
customers' liquidity preferences. Banks' willingness to offer borrowers the maturity they
demand is supported by legal and institutional settings of the German financial system,
especially the high degrees of creditor and proprietary rights as well as the conservative
valuation of pledged collateral. The use of interest rate swaps is driven mainly by the at-
tempt to comply with the current interest rate risk regulation in order to avoid regulatory
actions.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Banken sind Zinsrisiken aufgrund ihrer Geschäftstätigkeit, kurzfristige Einlagen in lang-
fristige Kredite zu transformieren, ausgesetzt. Das Zinsänderungsrisiko wird in der Bilanz
über die Fristeninkongruenz bzw. den "Duration Gap" (d.h. den Unterschied zwischen der
durchschnittlichen Restlaufzeit der Anlagen auf der Aktivseite und der Verbindlichkeiten
auf der Passivseite der Bilanz) sichtbar. Die Theorie der Finanzintermediation hat viel-
fach hervorgehoben, Zinsrisiken zu hedgen und sich stattdessen auf das Management von
Kreditrisiken zu fokussieren. Der Einsatz von Zins-Swaps ist eine einfache Möglichkeit,
Zinsrisiken zu eliminieren.
In unserer empirischen Studie untersuchen wir mit einem Simultangleichungsmodell
den bilanziellen Duration Gap zusammen mit dem außerbilanziellen Einsatz von Zins-
Swaps für deutsche Universalbanken in den Jahren 2000 bis 2011. Im Hinblick auf das
Zinsrisikomanagement deutscher Banken kommen wir zu den folgenden Aussagen:
ˇ Es findet eine gleichzeitige aktive Steuerung des bilanziellen Duration Gap und des
außerbilanziellen Einsatzes von Zins-Swaps statt.
ˇ Mögliche Kosten eines Ausfalls lassen Banken mit einem vergleichsweise geringen
Duration Gap operieren und vermehrt Zins-Swaps einsetzen.
ˇ Banken betreiben ein selektives Hedging von Zinsrisiken in Abhängigkeit vom ma-
kroökonomischen Umfeld. Bei einer steilen Zinsstrukturkurve, d.h. wenn Fristen-
transformation besonders profitabel ist, werden höhere Zinsrisiken eingegangen.
Letztere werden hingegen reduziert, wenn Unsicherheiten auf den Interbankenmärk-
ten die Banken verstärkt dem (eng mit dem Zinsrisiko verbundenen) Liquiditätsri-
siko aussetzten.
ˇ Handelsbuch-Institute treffen die Entscheidung "Duration Gap vs. Verwendung von
Zins-Swap" unabhängig voneinander. Bei reinen Bankbuch-Instituten hingegen wird
lediglich die Entscheidung über den Einsatz von Zins-Swaps vom Umfang des Dura-
tion Gaps getrieben; lediglich Banken, welche erstmalig Zins-Swaps nutzen, treffen
beide Entscheidungen gemeinsam. Das Volumen der gehaltenen Zins-Swaps wird
dahingegen immer in Abhängigkeit vom bilanziellen Duration Gap festgelegt.
Zusammenfassend zeigen unsere Ergebnisse, dass der Duration Gap primär durch die
Liquiditätspräferenzen der Kunden beeinflusst wird. Die Bereitschaft der Banken, ihren
Kunden Kredite mit der gewünschten Laufzeit anzubieten, wird durch zentrale Charakte-
ristika des deutschen Rechts- und Bankensystems begünstigt. Hierzu zählen insbesondere
Gläubiger- und Eigentumsrechte sowie die konservative Bewertung hinterlegter Sicherhei-
ten. Die Entscheidung zum Einsatz von Zins-Swaps ist hingegen überwiegend durch das
Befolgen der geltenden Zinsrisiko-Regulierung getrieben, um hierdurch gleichzeitig auch
Maßnahmen der Aufsicht zu vermeiden.

Abstract
We investigate financial intermediaries' interest rate risk management as the si-
multaneous decision of on-balance-sheet exposure and interest rate swap use. Our
findings show that both decisions are substitute risk management strategies. A
higher likelihood of bank distress makes banks reduce their on-balance sheet in-
terest rate exposure and simultaneously intensify their swap use. Exogeneity tests
indicate that both decisions are only endogenous to each other for banks that start
using swaps for the first time. For other banks, the maturity gap is endogenous to
the decision to use swaps, but the reverse relationship is exogenous. For banks with
trading activity, both decisions are exogenous to each other. We interpret these
findings as the maturity gap being largely determined by customer liquidity needs,
whereas the decision to use swaps relies on compliance with the interest rate risk
regulation. Although hedging motives dominate, we find selective hedging behavior
in swap use driven by the slope of the yield curve as well as by funding uncertainty.

BUNDESBANK DISCUSSION PAPER NO 56/2013
1 Introduction
Through their function as qualitative asset transformers, financial intermediaries are ex-
posed to non-diversifiable risks, specifically liquidity and interest rate risk. Financial
intermediation theory has derived models that explain the management and allocation
of these risks. Among the seminal studies explicitly related to interest rate risk (IRR),
Diamond (1984) stresses that banks should focus on managing credit risk for which they
possess a monitoring advantage, and hedge all IRR. Hellwig (1994) suggests that banks
allocate IRR to their depositors by offering contracts that do not necessarily repay de-
posits at par, thereby focusing on the liquidity risk of deposit withdrawal. Froot and
Stein (1998) propose that banks hedge all risks that can be sold to the capital market at
fair conditions, especially interest rate and currency risks.
However, although empirical evidence shows that banks manage their IRR, almost
no bank will hedge its IRR exposure completely (e.g., Landier, Sraer, and Thesmar,
2013). A large fraction of smaller banks in particular can be observed that do not use
any off-balance-sheet (OBS) IRR derivatives. The most obvious reason for banks to
keep IRR on the balance sheet instead of hedging it -- for example, by using interest rate
swaps -- is the expected profitability of maturity or term transformation, which we will use
interchangeably. A on average steep normally shaped yield curve increases profits when
a bank operates with a positive maturity mismatch, i.e., its assets have longer maturities
and reprice less frequently than its liabilities.1 However, these profits are associated with
the risk that a rise in the yield curve, especially at the lower maturity rates, may generate
losses as in the savings and loan (S&L) crisis. Moreover, the close alignment of interest
and liquidity risk through the maturity mismatch can threaten banks' existence when
they rely too heavily on short-term wholesale funding, as the 2007-2008 financial crisis
showed quite plainly.
Therefore, the question arises as to what determines banks' IRR management deci-
sions? To answer this question, we investigate German universal banks' IRR management
between 2000 to 2011 by simultaneously estimating their maturity mismatch and interest
rate swap activities. Our empirical approach relates the simultaneous risk management
framework of Purnanandam (2007) with the cross-sectional and time-series regression
models of Chernenko and Faulkender (2011) to distinguish the use of interest rate swaps
for hedging and speculative purposes in panel data. We find that on-balance-sheet IRR
management and the use of interest rate swaps are substitutes for one another in pursuit
of the goal of keeping the overall IRR exposure below regulatory thresholds. We also give
evidence of hedging theories which predict that the cost of bankruptcy makes firms pursue
more conservative risk management. Selective market timing behavior is observed for the
maturity mismatch, the decision to use interest rate swaps and the extent of their use with
regard to the slope of the yield curve and interbank funding uncertainty. The profitability
of a steep yield curve induces universal banks to simultaneously increase their duration
gap and to hold fewer interest rate swaps for hedging purposes, while the opposite holds
for increasing funding uncertainty.
One central determinant of the decision to manage risk on the balance sheet or off it
1Memmel (2011) estimates the income from term transformation generated by German savings and
cooperative banks over the business cycle to be around 30 basis points annually, which is a significant
share of their overall interest income.

is the financial environment in which a bank operates. Allen and Santomero (2001) stress
that banks' risk management techniques will differ between market-based and bank-based
financial systems as a result of the degree of competition financial intermediaries face from
financial markets. In bank-based economies, like Germany, financial intermediaries ap-
ply intertemporal smoothing of non-diversifiable risks through the accumulation of liquid
reserves. In market-based economies, households will withdraw their funds when banks
build up liquidity reserves. Financial intermediaries need different, cross-sectional risk
management strategies to shield themselves and households' portfolios against the afore-
mentioned risks (Allen and Gale, 1997). Increasingly popular cross-sectional risk sharing
encompasses derivatives hedging. Our study adds to the literature by investigating if there
do exist differences between the market-based German sample and the U.S. commercial
bank sample Purnanandam (2007) examined. We find that buffer stocks of liquid assets
have indeed a differing impact on the propensity to use interest rate swaps for hedging
purposes. In the U.S. they serve as substitutes whereas German universal banks seem to
consider them complementary hedging strategies.
We test the endogeneity assumptions underlying the simultaneous equations frame-
work and cannot reject for banks with a trading book that both, the maturity gap and
the decision to use interest rate swaps are exogenous to each other. For banks without
a trading book, the decision to hedge is exogenous to the maturity gap, but the reverse
relationship is endogenous. Only in samples of banks that use interest rate swaps the
first time both variables are found to be endogenous to each other. On the other hand,
the maturity gap is always an endogenous driver of the extent of banks' swap holdings.
These results seem to reflect the impact IRR regulation has on bank behavior. Banks
with too high an IRR exposure after netting out the OBS effects are considered "outlier"
banks that can expect supervisory scrutiny and even additional capital charges. Hence,
once the on-balance-sheet IRR exposure becomes too large, a bank has to look for ways
to decrease its overall exposure and will likely do so by using interest rate swaps. Only in
these circumstances, the maturity gap and the decision to hedge are endogenous to each
other. Before a bank reaches the critical threshold for on-balance-sheet exposure or once
it has set up a derivative risk management department, the decision to use interest rate
swaps is exogenous. As banks that have a comparatively large duration gap are those
that decide to use interest rate swaps, the duration gap is an endogenous driver of the
volume of swaps held. This suggests that banks manage their overall exposure to comply
with the IRR regulation, whereas the maturity gap is determined by the liquidity needs
of bank-dependent borrowers and depositors.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the literature on IRR
management as well as selective hedging and speculation of IRR. Section 3 describes the
empirical research strategy and puts emphasis on the instruments used to identify the
system of equations in the IRR framework. Data and summary statistics are presented in
Section 4, before we proceed with the empirical analysis. Section 5 introduces the hazard
rate model which is estimated in order to derive proxies for the cost of default in the risk
management analysis. Section 6 presents the results for the simultaneous equations of the
IRR management decisions, i.e., the on-balance-sheet exposure measured as the duration
gap, the decision to use swaps and the extent of interest rate swap use. Whenever possible,
regressions are run both cross-sectional and based on time-series estimators. The paper
ends with concluding remarks in Section 7.

2 Interest Rate Risk Management, Selective Hedging
and Speculation
In spite of banks' importance as suppliers of external capital and the IRR related to
their activities, the literature on banks' IRR management is relatively scarce, whereas the
majority of risk management literature focuses on corporate hedging decisions, mainly
commodity price hedging. Among the few exemptions, Schrand and Unal (1998) examine
thrifts' overall risk management and find -- in line with the models of Diamond (1984)
and Froot and Stein (1998) -- a shift from interest rate risk towards credit risk following
thrift conversion. These authors suggest that risk management is a mean of allocating
risks from homogeneous risk sources, such as IRR, to core-business risks, where the bank
possesses a comparative information advantage.
A central motive of hedging is the reduction of cash flow variability and consequently
bankruptcy risk. Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein (1993) endogenize the cost of financial dis-
tress by assuming external capital to be more expensive than internally generated funds.
In support of their model, Brewer, Jackson, and Moser (1996) show that hedging IRR
reduces the cost of uninsured debt, i.e., rates paid on commercial paper issued by thrifts.
Purnanandam (2007) simultaneously investigates the use of derivatives for hedging pur-
poses and on-balance-sheet IRR management of the duration gap for U.S. commercial
banks. He finds that banks intensify IRR management in response to increasing default
risk. Additionally, the use of interest rate derivatives makes banks less vulnerable to mon-
etary shocks and allows them to change the composition of their portfolios less drastically.
Memmel and Schertler (2014) show -- for the same sample of German universal banks
we investigate -- that net interest income is more heavily affected by changes in the yield
curve than by changes in the composition of asset and liability portfolios. Banks that
use IRR derivatives are less vulnerable to interest rate shocks, and hence derivatives are
mainly employed for hedging purposes. However, when the yield curve steepens derivative
users increase their maturity mismatch more significantly. In contrast to the papers that
show that banks use interest rate swaps predominately for hedging purposes, Begenau,
Piazzesi, and Schneider (2013) prove that the largest four U.S. banks that serve as swap
dealers used their swap positions to increase their exposure to IRR.
Bolton, Chen, and Wang (2011) present a dynamic risk management model where
bankruptcy risk increases the risk of not having sufficient funds for value-adding invest-
ment projects, thus increasing the incentives to hedge. However, for financially con-
strained firms it is optimal not to hedge as margin requirements override cash flow volatil-
ity concerns. Moreover, their model shows that market timing behavior can be rational
in terms of ensuring sufficient funding sources.2
Market timing of risk management activities has received increasing attention in fi-
nancial research. Stulz (1996) defines selective hedging as managers incorporating market
views into the timing of risk management activities, and considers this a mild form of
speculation. Empirical and survey evidence from non-financial firms suggests that timing
derivatives markets is done quite frequently. Such strategies should, however, result in
permanent additional profits only if managers have an information advantage, but sum

of new shares, and not debt market or derivatives market timing.

up to zero otherwise.
The main drivers of selective IRR risk management when entering into new debt
contracts or interest rate derivatives are the level and, especially, the slope of the yield
curve. Faulkender (2005) finds that firms alter the IRR exposure of new debt issues from
fixed to floating by jointly entering into interest rate swaps when the yield curve is steep.
Vickery (2008) confirms these results for small bank-dependent firms that choose between
fixed-rate and variable-rate loans. Credit constrained firms, however, are more likely to
choose fixed-rate interest per se. Recently, Mian and Santos (2012) have found evidence of
active maturity management driven by liquidity considerations. Credit-worthy firms tend
to renegotiate and extend loan maturity early during periods of good financial conditions.
The behavior of bank-dependent borrowers should have a directly observable effect on
banks' balance sheets and might trigger changes in their OBS risk management. Besides
selective hedging, corporate use of interest rate derivatives also reveals speculation on
interest movements. Géczy, Minton, and Schrand (2007) and Chernenko and Faulkender
(2011) find evidence that financially unconstrained firms incorporate market views into
their derivatives positions and use interest rate swaps, at least partly, for speculative
purposes, too.
3 Research Design
3.1 Regression Design
If banks manage their overall IRR exposure, -- the composite on- and off-balance sheet
exposure -- decisions on the maturity mismatch and on the use of interest rate swaps
are jointly determined. We therefore follow Purnanandam (2007) in estimating these
decisions simultaneously using 2SLS IV regressions in order to overcome endogeneity
and the resulting simultaneity bias of OLS coefficients. In line with most of the risk
management literature, we separate the decision to hedge from the extent of derivative
use by estimating a Cragg (1971) model. The model follows a two-step procedure, and
investigates first which determinants drive the decision to use interest rate derivatives. In
the subsequent step it examines the drivers of the extent of derivatives use conditional
on a positive decision to use derivatives. The decision to hedge corresponds to a dummy
variable that takes the value of 1 if a bank reports a non-zero volume of interest rate
swaps outstanding. Although interest rate swaps are only one out of several derivatives a
bank can use to offset IRR, they are the most common ones to hedge IRR. As information
on interest rate swaps is available at the highest quality, we exclusively focus our IRR
hedging analysis on the use of interest rate swaps. The extent of hedging is modeled
as the natural logarithm of the nominal volume of interest rate swaps outstanding to
total assets. The potential sample selection bias arising from conditioning the sample to
banks that decide to use interest rate swaps is controlled for by including the inverse Mills
ratio. The modified duration gap is modeled using information available to the banking
supervisors on different brackets of remaining time to maturity for classes of assets and
liabilities and the interest rate sensitivities from the standard approach for IRR regulation
of the German banking supervisory authority BaFin. See Appendix B, for more details
of the modified duration gap.
To estimate the simultaneous equation system exclusion restrictions are required.
4
Valid IVs are allowed to influence only one of the two risk management decisions, ei-
ther the on-balance-sheet or the off-balance-sheet decision. We use two instruments for
each equation and provide overidentification tests to support the validity of the IVs. With
strong and valid instruments at hand, we test the endogeneity assumed in the simultane-
ous equation framework, using endogeneity tests based on the C statistic, which is defined
as the difference in overidentification J-tests derived from 2SLS models.3
We will use the following instruments in the risk management equations and justify
their use extensively in Section 3.2. For the duration gap, we propose the use of the
share of Customer loans in relation to total assets and Loan commitments to total assets.
For the decision to use interest rate swaps and the extent of their use we include Past
swap experience as a dummy variable that equals 1 from the point in time a bank has first
started to use swaps. To create this variable we use data starting in 1998. We additionally
use Average board experience, as the average experience of all board members in relevant
executive management positions measured in years, as an instrument for the decision to
use interest rate swaps but not for the extent of their use. This allows us to correct for
the sample selection bias by adding the inverse Mills ratio into the extent of interest rate
swap regressions. Furthermore, we include an exogenous instrument with regard to the
risk management decisions in the estimation of the hazard rate model. Here, we choose
Hidden liabilities, a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if a bank avoids writing off
assets. This gives the following system of equations:
DG =DG
+ DG1
SU + DG2
CL + DG3
LC + DG4
X + DG
SU =SU
+ SU1
DG + SU2
PSE + SU3
BExp + SU4
X + SU
SE =SE
+ SE1
DG + SE2
PSE + SE3
IMR + SE4
X + SE
,
(1)
where subscripts indicating bank or time units are left out for simplicity. DG stands
for the (modified) duration gap, SU is the dummy of the swap use decision, and SE
represents the extent of interest rate swap use, proxied by the logarithm of the nominal
volume of interest rate swaps in relation to total assets. CL is customer loans, and LC
loan commitments. PSE is the dummy of past interest rate swap experience, and BExp is
the average board experience, while IMR is the inverse Mills ratio controlling for sample
selection in the extent of interest rate swap use. X is a vector of all explanatory variables
that influence all risk management decisions including the Probability of default (PD).
For the duration gap and the extent of swap use equations we exploit both the cross-
sectional and the time-series variation. The cross-sectional variation is captured applying
both, between effects and Fama-MacBeth estimators. The results are then compared to
those from pooled OLS models to evaluate the impact of a potential bias. The time-series
variation is investigated applying the within transformation of a fixed effects estimator.
When modelling the decision to use swaps, we apply pooled probit regressions only in
order not to lose observations on banks that never hedge or, alternatively, hedge during
the whole sample period.
The use of cross-sectional as well as time-series estimators for IRR management de-
cisions, such as the on-balance-sheet exposure and the extent of interest rate swap use,
3The C statistic can be computed for clustered standard errors, whereas the Hausman test is calculated
under homoskedasticity. For probit models we use the endogeneity test of Lee (1992) but linear probability
models using the C-statistic confirm our results.

is related to the empirical approach of Chernenko and Faulkender (2011) who examine
non-financial firms' interest rate swap use. One of the key elements of interpreting the
coefficients is that these firms are assumed to have a constant exposure to IRR over time.
When firms manage towards a target fixed-to-floating IRR exposure, average hedge ratios
should be explained by between effects and Fama-MacBeth models. In contrast, devi-
ations from a target hedge ratio over time can be understood as market views on IRR
drivers being incorporated into the hedging decision. Such market timing is then captured
by fixed effects estimators.
Although the assumption of a constant IRR exposure over time is doubtful for banks
in general, small, locally operating savings and cooperative banks have homogeneous
business models with a focus on granting loans and accepting deposits, providing them
thereby with comparably stable on-balance-sheet exposures. Evidence is provided by
Memmel (2008) and Entrop, Memmel, Ruprecht, and Wilkens (2012) who explain the
majority of banks' interest income and expenses using revolving portfolios based on the
assumption that on-balance exposure remains stable via replacement of maturing assets
and liabilities with new business of equal maturity. The results of Memmel and Schertler
(2014) provide further support for the on-balance-sheet exposure being comparatively
stable among German banks.
Additionally, small universal banks are also more likely not to engage in trading ac-
tivities and most of them only have a banking book and no trading book. Pure banking
book institutions are prohibited from using OBS instruments for speculation purposes to
a substantial extent.4 In analyzing only pure banking book institutions, we thus have a
setting similar to Chernenko and Faulkender (2011) for which the constant on-balance
exposure assumption and hence the interpretation of cross-sectional and time-series esti-
mators seems justified. In order to examine the whole German banking sector, we run
regressions for the total sample, which consists of around 90% non-banking book insti-
tutions, and for the sub-sample of trading book banks. The latter not only have more
exposure to market risk, but they may also use interest rate swaps for speculation which
goes beyond the market timing of risk management activities. For example, Begenau et al.
(2013) show that the four largest U.S. banks use interest rate swaps to increase their IRR
exposure instead of hedging it. Furthermore, banks might use trading activities to shift
risks, which harms traditional relationship banking (Boot and Ratnovski, 2013).
3.2 Exclusion Restrictions
In the following we draw on the literature to justify the use of the instruments we intro-
duced above.
Instruments to identify the probability of default:
As corporate risk management theory stresses the importance of the cost of bankruptcy
for risk taking, hedging and speculation behavior, we include the natural logarithm of
the Probability of default (PD) derived from a hazard rate model to proxy for this de-
4The German Banking Act (KWG) defines banks as trading book institutions when they have on
average (in a single year) either trading activities of more than 5% (6%) in relation to both total assets
and off-balance-sheet activities, or of more than e15 (20) million in absolute terms. These volumes are
minor compared to the total assets of universal banks in Germany, even of the small cooperative banks.
See Table 2 for details.

terminant. However, the cost of bankruptcy and the resulting financial constraints are
endogenous to risk management decisions (e.g., Froot et al., 1993; Bolton et al., 2011).
Although the variables we use in the hazard rate model are not identical to those in the
risk management regressions, many of the variables that explain a bank's default are also
drivers of its risk management decisions and hence do not qualify as IVs.
In order for the PD, derived from the hazard rate model, to be an exogenous deter-
minant of the IRR management decisions, at least one explanatory variable must not
have a direct influence on the magnitude of the duration gap, the decision to use swaps,
and the extent of their use. We argue that avoiding write-offs on assets,5 -- creating so
called Hidden liabilities -- satisfies the exclusion restriction. This accounting option in
the German GAAP -- (the commercial code, HGB) -- is often used as a form of "window
dressing" for accounting statements by postponing realized losses into the future.
Biddle, Ma, and Song (2013a,b) observe that accounting conservatism6 reduces sub-
sequent corporate bankruptcy risk through restricted earnings management and higher
cash reserves, as well as by directly reducing operating cash flow downside risk. Avoiding
hidden liabilities and thereby realizing losses on securities held in a more timely manner
is a form of conservative accounting. After controlling for the indirect effect accounting
conservatism has on cash holdings, by controlling for liquid assets, there should be no
further effect of hidden liabilities on the risk management decisions other than through
operating cash flow downside risk, which should be correlated with the PD estimates.
Instruments to identify the maturity gap equation:
The maturity gap, especially for savings and cooperative banks, is driven by the demand
for long maturity liquidity on the asset side and the supply of short-term deposits on
the liability side. In contrast, interbank loans are used by these banks to reduce the on-
balance-sheet exposure (Ehrmann and Worms, 2004). Instrument validity is given when
the only impact Customer loans have on interest rate swap use emanates from the IRR
they add to the modified duration gap.
We argue further that Loan commitments have a direct impact on the maturity mis-
match but not on interest rate swap usage. This argument seems counterintuitive as loan
commitments are OBS activities and do not have a directly observable impact on the on-
balance-sheet IRR. Moreover, if they were fixed-rate loan commitments their IRR could
be hedged using futures or forwards.
Although we cannot distinguish fixed-rate from floating-rate loan commitments, we
create a loan commitment proxy that is likely to be dominated by floating-rate agreements.
Our definition excludes long-term commitments for investment expenditures and real
estate loans, but includes household and corporate lines of credit that are more likely to
be short-term floating-rate agreements.7
5Write-offs can be avoided by assigning and reclassifying certain kinds of securities to the banking
book, where they are accounted for at historical cost instead of their lower market value.
6Accounting conservatism is considered to be a prudent reaction to risk and uncertainty and their
adequate disclosure in accounting statements. Unconditional conservatism is the effect of accounting
principles per se. Conditional conservatism relates to more timely recognition of negative corporate
outcomes.
7Davydenko and Franks (2008) present summary statistics from major German commercial banks'
defaulted corporate borrowers. The majority of loans and credit lines are, indeed, short-term with
maturities of less than one year and floating-rate. However, their sample might be biased to firms that
were already financially constrained when they received their loans and overdrafts.
7
The literature offers additional arguments why undrawn loan commitments might have
a direct impact on banks' balance sheets. Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2002) derive a model
in which banks possess a natural hedge against liquidity risk via imperfectly correlated
draw-down risk for loan commitments and withdrawal risk for deposits. Carrying out
both, lending and deposit activities offers banks synergies in using the buffer stock of
liquid assets.
Berger, Espinosa-Vega, Frame, and Miller (2005) find that corporates drawing loans
under commitment receive loans with no different maturity if they are high-risk firms.
On the other hand, high-risk corporates not drawing under commitment receive only
loans with significantly lower maturity. Loan commitments, especially (revolving) lines
of credit, are means of acquiring soft information on borrowers out of relationship lend-
ing8 and provide monitored liquidity insurance that prevents borrowers' illiquidity seeking
(Acharya, Almeida, Ippolito, and Perez, 2014). Undrawn loan commitments can, there-
fore, have a direct effect on the existing maturity gap via the information collected in
the past from relationship lending, intensified monitoring upon frequent renewal, and the
liquidity hedge deposits offer.
Instruments to identify the swap use decision and the extent of their use equations:
The Past swap experience dummy serves as a proxy for the existence of a derivatives risk
management department or experience in handling interest rate derivatives. Chen (2011)
uses a similar instrumental variable. More precisely, he uses the past experience of fund
managers as an IV for the current use of derivatives by the hedge funds they manage.
Purnanandam (2007) uses a cross-sectional hedging experience dummy that takes the
value of 1 if the bank holds derivatives for purposes other than IRR management during
the same period. Unfortunately, in our sample too few banks use currency swaps to create
IVs that pass the weak identification test.9
One potential concern with a dummy based on past hedging experience is that previous
years' interest rate swap use predetermines contemporaneous use. This would be the case
if a bank buys swaps with maturities of more than one year and holds them until maturity.
We do not see a problem in using past swap use for the following reasons. First, about 10%
of the banks in our sample that used swaps in an earlier year do not do so the year after.
Therefore, swap experience does not perfectly predict current swap use and some banks
change frequently between years where they use swaps and years where they do not. Even
if banks engage in swaps with maturities of more than one year, it is possible for them to
close these positions. Second, Gorton and Rosen (1995) report that a substantial share
of interest rate swaps held by banks have maturities of less than one year for reasons of
regulatory capital charges on counterparty risk. Moreover, during the past decade, there
has been a substantial increase in short-term maturity overnight index swaps (OIS) to
hedge interbank rates. Current figures presented in Fleming, Jackson, Li, Sarkar, and
8See, for example, Berger and Udell (1995); Jiménez, Lopez, and Saurina (2009); Norden and Weber
(2010), and specifically for German banks screening for bankruptcy risk, Davydenko and Franks (2008).
9We run robustness checks, not reported for brevity, that contain information on whether the bank
uses any kind of derivatives to hedge or speculate on currency or market risk. Unfortunately, data is
available only until 2008. The coefficients derived are very similar to those reported when employing
the Past swap experience and overidentification tests are also insignificant for all samples investigated.
However, the weak instrument statistics are significantly lower, and although they are still above the
values suggested by Stock and Yogo (2005), the coefficients for the instrumented Dummy interest rate
swap use cannot be distinguished from zero.
8
Zobel (2012) support these statements. Although 10-year and 30-year interest rate swaps
are still frequently traded tenors for hedging the IRR from long-term loans, the vast
majority of all interest rate derivatives have maturities of less than one-year.
Our second instrument is based on the finding that characteristics of board members
have an impact on hedging decisions, but not on the extent of hedging (e.g., Zhu, 2011,
2012). Therefore, we include the average experience of all board members in bank execu-
tive positions measured in years as an explanatory variable for the decision to use swaps.
As this variable does not influence the extent of hedging, we can use it additionally to
estimate the inverse Mills ratio in a sample selection model and do not simply identify the
selection model from the non-linearity of a probit estimator. Average board experience
therefore qualifies the exclusion restrictions for both, the maturity gap and the extent
of swap use decision and only has a direct impact on the decision to use interest rate
swaps. Zhu (2011) uses a dummy based on whether the CEO is below the age of 45 as
a variable identifying the decision to hedge, but not the extent thereof.10 We argue that
board experience has no other influence on the maturity gap decision apart from the effect
through the use of interest rate derivatives, as the maturity gap for most banks is largely
determined by borrower and depositor liquidity needs.
3.3 Common Control and Market Timing Variables
Our bank-specific explanatory variables are consistent with those used in the study by
Purnanandam (2007). Size, measured as the logarithm of total assets, is included to proxy
for economies of scale in setting up a derivatives department. Larger banks are more likely
to have a risk management department that is proficient enough to deal with derivatives.
At the same time, larger banks are also more likely to have other income sources apart
from interest income and might, as a result, not depend to the same extent on income
from term transformation. Based on Froot et al. (1993) banks with more investment
opportunities should be more likely to decrease IRR both, on balance sheet and off balance
sheet. Investment opportunities are proxied in line with the banking literature (e.g., Froot
and Stein, 1998) by the (annual) Total asset growth rate. As current risk management
literature stresses the importance of liquidity management considerations, we include two
measures which capture liquidity on the asset and liability side, Liquid assets, the sum of
cash reserves and securities which can be sold within one year, and the ratio of Savings
deposits to total assets as a measure of funding strength.
In addition to Purnanandam, we include a Branch HHI, a Herfindahl (-Hirschman)
index of branch concentration at the county level, as a measure of bank competition.11
The model derived by Adam, Dasgupta, and Titman (2007) predicts that competition has
a direct impact on the decision to hedge risks in equilibrium. Furthermore, competition
may have an effect on the maturity mismatch choice via its nexus with risk taking. When
we investigate the total sample, we also include a dummy that takes the value of 1 for
banks with a trading book, and we include banking group dummies (savings, cooperative
10For the smaller German savings banks and cooperative banks, it is not possible to identify the CEO
or the CFO of a bank as these banks do not distinguish between different board responsibilities.
11Most of the savings banks and cooperative banks, and, therefore, the majority of banks in our sample,
are limited to running branches in their municipality, which is referred to as the regional principle. We
therefore consider the county level the relevant market to measure banking concentration.
9
and private banks) to control for different business models in the cross-sectional settings.
Time-series models of the maturity gap and the extent of interest rate swap use as
well as the pooled probit models of the decision to use interest rate swaps also include
macroeconomic variables to test for market timing behavior in IRR management. These
include the slope of the yield curve (e.g., Faulkender, 2005; Vickery, 2008) and a variable
we refer to as EURIBOR spread, the difference between the 12-month EURIBOR and
the 12-month German government bond yield. The latter is intended to capture the
effects of the TED spread used in U.S. banking studies and proxies for interbank funding
uncertainty. We also interact both of the aforementioned macroeconomic variables with
the 1-year government bond yield to analyze differing effects of banks' risk taking behavior
in response to the monetary environment (Borio and Zhu, 2012).12
4 Data and Summary Statistics
4.1 Data
We use data from 2000 to 2011 in our simultaneous risk management framework. We
chose the start date of the analysis in accordance with the availability of data for the
variable Liquid assets. For the hazard rate model we employ data starting in 1994 to
make use of as many default events as possible, especially restructuring mergers during
the wave of consolidation the German banking sector underwent in the 1990s. To create
the instrument Past swap experience, we use information dating back to 1998. All data is
provided by the prudential banking supervision databases of the Deutsche Bundesbank.
To cope with outliers, we windsorize our variables at the 99th percentile and at the 1st
percentile, except for Size and (the logarithm of) the Probability of default estimated in
the hazard rate model. The impact of mergers on the consistency of accounting measures
is accounted for by creating a new banking entity after every merger taking place. This
is the most frequently applied approach when using Bundesbank data. When we create
the Past swap experience dummy, the variable takes the value of 1 for the new entity if
at least one of the two pre-merger institutions used any kind of swaps before the merger.
As our variable is intended to proxy for the existence of a derivatives risk management
department, this procedure seems justified as the knowledge of how to hedge risks off the
balance sheet is unlikely to be lost during a merger process.
4.2 Summary Statistics
Table 1 displays the distribution of banks using interest rate swaps over the sample period
from 2000 to 2011. Although the absolute number of banks reporting interest rate swap
use increases only slightly from 599 to 677, their relative share increases heavily from
29.95% in 2000 to 49.16% in 2011. This effect is due to the consolidation of the German
banking sector that led to the disappearance of about 700 banks during the sample period.
The relative increase in the use of interest rate swaps was quite sharp between 2003 and
2007, but slowed thereafter. A clear relation between a bank's size and the use of interest

This table presents the distribution of German universal banks' use of interest rate swaps according to size quintiles between 2000 to 2011.
Size quintiles are based on total assets in 2011, where the 1st quintile encompasses the smallest and the 5th the largest banks. Swap users are
defined according to a positive nominal volume of interest rate swaps at the end of a given calendar year.
rate swaps is observable. Whereas in the lowest size quintile 12% of banks hold interest
rate swaps in 2011, the percentage increases gradually and peaks at the highest quintile
at more than 86%.
Interestingly, the current share of interest rate swap users is close 50%, which corre-
sponds to the solution of firms hedging in equilibrium in the Adam et al. (2007) model.
These authors also summarize many studies which find the percentage of non-financial
firms in several industries and indices to be close to this value. As the banking sector is a
regulated industry with supervision of risk management, this result should, however, not
be mistaken for the industry equilibrium percentage of hedging firms in the model cited
above.
Surprisingly, we find a significantly larger percentage of banks that manage IRR off
the balance sheet in our study compared to Purnanandam (2007), although the theory
of intertemporal smoothing would have predicted the opposite (Allen and Santomero,
2001). In our sample, 31.28% of universal banks report interest rate swaps outstanding in
2003, whereas Purnanandam reports 5.94% users of interest rate derivatives for hedging
purposes for his U.S. commercial bank sample in the third quarter of 2003.
We present summary statistics of the variables used in the risk management equations
in Table 2, separately for interest rate swap users and non-users, and test for differences
in means and medians between these two groups. Some noteworthy features appear:
swap users have indeed a higher modified duration gap. The mean difference is 0.14
and significant at the 1% level. Moreover, swap users are larger in size with regard to
total assets and are more likely to have a trading book. They hold less liquid assets and
receive less funding from savings deposits, but nevertheless make more loan commitments.
Interestingly, the average board experience is significantly lower for banks that use swaps.
For most of the variables, the differences between users and non-users are significant at
11
the 1% level. One exception is the difference in the means of the probability of default,
which cannot be distinguished statistically.
German universal banks indeed have comparatively large buffer stocks of liquid assets,
as predicted by the theory of intertemporal smoothing in Allen and Gale (1997). The
mean of liquid assets in relation to total assets is around 43.5% for swap users and 44.5%
for non-users, and the difference of 1 percentage point is economically not very large,
although statistically significant. Purnanandam (2007) reports non-users as having, on
average, 36% and users 30.5% liquid assets. Here, overall levels are smaller and the
difference between users and non-users of interest rate derivatives for hedging purposes
is more pronounced. It should, however, be borne in mind that the definitions of liquid
assets do not completely match.
5 Hazard Rate Model
Following Purnanandam (2007), we proxy for the cost of bankruptcy by estimating the
bank-specific probability of default (PD) from a hazard rate model.13 The hazard rate
model is estimated using default events from 1994 to 2011. All covariates are lagged
values from the previous year-end. Defaults for 2012 were not available at the start of
this study. PDs for 2011 have therefore been predicted from the coefficients derived with
covariates until 2010. We include the following default indicators into the dependent
variable dummy: forced closures, restructuring mergers, and capital injections by either
sectoral insurance schemes or the federal scheme set up during the recent financial crisis.
The model is estimated using a pooled multiperiod logit model (Shumway, 2001) with
standard errors clustered at the bank level. A similar model is used in the banking super-
vision department of the Bundesbank to gauge the financial soundness of national banks.
The bank-specific covariates are based on the CAMELS taxonomy and therefore include
variables capturing capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and
sensitivity to market risk.14
Specifically, we choose the following variables to estimate the PD: capital adequacy is
included using the Tier 1 capital ratio, the ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets
(RWA), and Total bank reserves, the ratio of total banks reserves that serve as equity to
total assets (TA). The dummy Reserve reduction takes the value 1 if the aforementioned
reserves have been reduced. Asset quality is proxied using a Herfindahl (-Hirschman) in-
dex (HHI) of loan concentration over 23 industry sectors. Earnings are captured by ROE,
the return on equity, defined as operating income to equity. Additionally, the competitive
environment is controlled for by the Branch HHI on the county level. Financial interme-
diation theory provides predictions for the nexus of risk taking and competition. Boyd
13This approach implicitly assumes identical loss given default (LDG) for banks when the PD is the only
relevant variable. Purnanandam (2007), however, finds no qualitatively different results when proxying
LGD instead of PD. Moreover, the model of Brunnermeier and Oehmke (2013) implies that a bank's PD,
and not the LGD, is the major driver of a "maturity rat race" leading to excessively short durations for
banks' liabilities.
14Liquid asset measures are not included as an explanatory variable, which is the common procedure
in the "Bundesbank hazard rate model". If included, such measures show up insignificant as liquidity
appears to be an indicator for the lack of business opportunities and not of active risk management
(Porath, 2006).

13
and De Nicoló (2005) show that the effect of competition on bank risk taking depends on
borrowers' reaction to the transmission channel of market power into loan rates. More
concentrated banking markets can trigger less risk taking through rising charter values.
However, raising loan rates can also increase risk taking if the pool of borrowers is more
likely to default. Therefore, predictions on the coefficient of the Branch HHI cannot be
made. The level of the short-term interbank 3-month EURIBOR rate and regional GDP
growth at the state level are included to control for changes in the macroeconomic envi-
ronment. Dummies for savings and cooperative banks capture heterogeneity in business
models with private banks being the reference group left out.
The impact of these variables can be seen in Table 3 and is presented displaying
marginal effects from the logit model. As expected, Tier 1 capital and bank reserve en-
dowments reduce bankruptcy risk significantly, whereas the dummy indicating reserve
reductions is an indicator of significantly higher default likelihood. Specialization in cer-
tain business sectors via concentrated loan portfolios does not significantly impact default
likelihoods. ROE significantly reduces bankruptcy risk through its effect on capital accu-
mulation. A higher value for the Branch HHI indicates more concentrated and, therefore,
less competitive banking markets. Our results thus indicate that competition in the
banking market slightly improves banking stability. Business conditions captured in local
GDP growth have no significant influence on bank default, but a lower level for short-
term interbank rates increases distress likelihood as predicted by the risk-taking channel
of monetary policy (Borio and Zhu, 2012). At first glance, this finding contradicts the
effect that would have been attributed to funding conditions and experiences of the U.S.
savings and loan (S&L) crisis. However, contemporaneous studies confirm the positive
relation of short-term interest rates to banks' risk-taking behavior (Jiménez, Ongena,
Peydró, and Saurina, 2014).
We consider Hidden liabilities to be exogenous to the risk management decisions exam-
ined in Section 6. The coefficient is positive as expected and significant with a t-statistic
of almost 3.3. Having hidden liabilities on the balance sheet increases the likelihood of
default during the following year by 35%, a change of high economic magnitude. In-
strumenting actual defaults with the Dummy hidden liabilities in the risk management
regressions of Section 6 -- using defaults as the only variable to be instrumented in a lin-
ear probability model -- we receive weak instrument statistics which are always above the
rule of thumb threshold of 10. Except for the extent of swap use time-series equation the
Kleibergen-Paap F-statistic is also above the critical threshold of 16.38 Stock and Yogo
(2005) calculated for the Cragg-Donald F-statistic received under the assumption of i.i.d.
standard errors for a 10% maximal size distortion of the 2SLS estimator. Although no
critical values for the Kleibergen-Paap statistic with clustered standard errors exist, the
F-statistics are in general of conveniant magnitude to conclude that hidden liabilities are
an instrument strong enough to estimate a PD that is exogenous to the risk management
decisions. In further regressions where both, the actual default and the decision to use
swaps or the maturity gap are considered endogenous and are therefore instrumented, we
cannot reject tests of overidentifying restrictions with the null of valid instruments in all
cases at the 10% level. Overidentification is achieved using the two instruments for the
decision to use interest rate swaps or the maturity gap. Furthermore, we provide in the
column on the right to the Kleibergen-Paap statistics also the Angrist-Pischke statistic
when the effect of the other two instruments is partialled out. Again, these statistics

Dependent variable: distress event, including forced closures, restructuring mergers, and capital injections. The model is
estimated as a logit regression over the time period from 1994-2011. Coefficients are displayed as marginal effects. All
covariates are lagged from the previous year end. Standard errors are clustered at bank level and displayed in parentheses.
Significance at the 10%/5%/1% level is marked by */**/***. Kleibergen-Paap and Angrist-Pischke F -statistics for weak
identification and overidentification statistics are from the regressions run in Section 6 when distress events are included
instead of the probability of default and instrumented using hidden liabilities. Overidentification is achieved using two
instruments each for either the duration gap or interest rate swap use. Angrist-Pischke statistics are the F -statistics when
the impact of the other two instruments has been partialled out. Kleibergen-Paap statistics, on the other hand, are the first
stage F -statistics when only the distress events are instrumented and are always carried out as linear probability models
(Angrist, 2001). The regression for deriving the overidentification statistic with the hedging decision as the dependent
variable is a two-step IV-Probit regressions (Newey, 1987) and the overidentification statistic is from Lee (1992). In all other
regressions the overidentification test is a Hansen-J test.
15
confirm the strength of hidden liabilities as an instrument to identify the PD, except for
the time-series equation of the extent of swap use. As we are interested in the impact the
latent variable Probability of default has on risk management decisions rather than the
actual default, we will not proceed using actual default in the following risk management
regressions.
The hazard rate model has both, good predictive and discriminatory powers. Statis-
tical power is evaluated using the pseudo R2, which has a value of 0.189. Discriminatory
power is judged using the value of the area under the Receiver Operating Characteris-
tics (ROC) Curve, which is 0.859. Both values are comparatively good considering the
parsimonious use of explanatory variables compared with other studies.
Unlike in the U.S., the German banking industry did not undergo a major crisis with
its underlying causes in the dynamics of interest rates, like the S&L crisis that affected
thrifts in the U.S. during the 1980s. Although we find that defaulting banks were more
sensitive to a decrease in the level of interbank rates, we did not include specific variables
related to interest rate risk taking, and thus there exists no ex ante mechanical relation
between the PDs derived and IRR management.
6 Simultaneous Interest Rate Risk Management
We present and discuss the results of the three equations in the simultaneous model --
estimated using two-stage least squares (2SLS) -- in different tables. Standard errors
are either clustered at bank level or bootstrapped. Results for cross-sectional models are
presented as between effects as well as pooled IV models. In Table 4 and 5 we provide
support that pooled models for the modified duration gap and the extent of interest rate
swap use derive coefficients quite similar to Fama-MacBeth models when all explanatory
variables are considered exogenous. In contrast to the Fama-MacBeth method, pooled
2SLS offers a rich variety of test statistics for the IVs and corrects standard errors for the
fact that the endogenous variables have been instrumented in the first stage.
6.1 Maturity Gap
6.1.1 Cross-Sectional Variation
Table 6 presents the cross-sectional results of the maturity gap equation within the si-
multaneous risk management framework. As expected, the coefficients of the swap use
dummy are significantly positive, indicating that banks deciding to use interest rate swaps
are operating with a higher maturity mismatch. On average, universal banks that use
swaps have a 0.16 percentage point higher modified duration gap. The effect is highest
for trading book institutions where the effect amounts to 0.65, or 0.48 percentage points,
depending on the estimated model. The economic magnitude of these coefficients is quite
substantial. In the pooled OLS setting switching from a non-swap user to a user increases
the modified duration gap on average by 0.2 standard deviations (sd), for pure banking
book institutions by 0.19 sd, and for trading book banks by even 0.47 sd. The posi-
tive coefficients give evidence that, although trading book institutions might use interest
rate swaps for the purpose of speculation, they predominantly seem to use them for the
purpose of hedging, and confirm previous results from Memmel and Schertler (2014).

The effect of the PD supports the predictions of theoretical risk management models,
such as Froot et al. (1993) and Froot and Stein (1998), that the potential distress cost
leads banks to take less IRR. Again, this effect is most pronounced for trading book
institutions. A one sd change in the PD decreases the modified duration gap by 0.04
sd for non-trading book banks, and by 0.13 sd for trading book institutions. As trading
book institutions receive more of their funding from capital markets and arms-length
relationships in interbank markets, whereas the majority of pure banking book institutions
receive interbank loans from their associated head institutions (Ehrmann and Worms,
2004), the coefficients found might reflect the effect of risk taking on the cost of external
finance, as documented by Brewer et al. (1996).
Size leads pure banking book institutions to take more, but trading book institutions
to take less IRR on the balance sheet. Business opportunities show the expected negative
effect, as predicted by Froot et al. (1993) and Froot and Stein (1998), only for pure
banking book institutions. For trading book financial intermediaries the opposite holds,
although the coefficients are only significant in the pooled OLS setting. Both, asset and
funding liquidity induce banks to engage in less maturity transformation. This finding
is not surprising for liquid assets as a substantial portion of these assets have a short-
term maturity that reduces the modified duration gap. For savings deposits the finding is,
however, surprising as the short-term funding nature of deposits leads to a higher duration
gap per se. On the other hand, many small regional banks with strong deposit funding
lack business opportunities and hold proportionally large liquidity buffers, often deposited
via interbank loans at their head institutions. The results of all coefficients presented so
far are consistent with those found by Purnanandam (2007) in cross-sectional regressions
where Fama-MacBeth estimators have been applied. More concentrated and therefore
less competitive markets lead to more on-balance-sheet interest rate risk taking.
The coefficients for Customer loans and Loan commitments are positive and significant
at the 1% level in all regressions. Banks with a higher share of customer loan volume
indeed have a higher duration gap as already documented by Ehrmann and Worms (2004).
The positive coefficient for the ratio of loan commitments confirms the results of Berger
et al. (2005) that banks use loan commitments to gather information on borrower quality
and finally to offer loans with longer maturity. The significance levels serve as upfront
indicators of instrument relevance in the swap use regressions presented in Section 6.2.
The first-stage instrumentation process of Interest rate swap use -- which has been
carried out for simplicity as a linear probability model -- proves instrument relevance.15
Past swap experience and the average board experience have high explanatory power
for the interest rate swap use dummy. The F-statistics are always larger than 10 and
also exceed the Stock and Yogo (2005) threshold of 19.93 for the Cragg-Donald statis-
tics for a 10% maximal size distortion calculated under homoscedastic standard errors.
Overidentification tests under the joint null that the model is correctly specified and that
instruments are exogenous cannot be rejected at a 10% level. Interestingly, the endo-
geneity test statistics show that the null of interest rate swap use being exogenous to the
magnitude of the maturity gap cannot be rejected at levels always above a p-value of 25%
for all three samples. Hence, the results derived are quite similar to pooled OLS models
15Using fitted values from a first-stage probit model as instruments -- as described in Wooldridge
(2010) -- does not change the results qualitatively. This holds for all other regression models, both
cross-sectional and time-series. However, this approach would not allow a test for overidentification.

that take the decision to employ interest rate swaps as exogenous.
6.1.2 Time-Series Variation
In this Section, we investigate the time-series behavior of the modified duration gap and
present the results in Table 7. The use of panel data allows us to include macroeconomic
variables which we can use to prove market timing behavior in on-balance-sheet IRR ex-
posure. Our standard model (Panel A) includes time dummies to control for the potential
impact of several macroeconomic indicators. Compared to the cross-sectional model, the
time-series model has significantly lower explanatory power based on the coefficient of
determination R2. The variables included are therefore better able to distinguish cross-
sectional differences between banks than to explain the adjustment of the duration gap
over time.
In the baseline model, we find the coefficients for the Interest rate swap use to be
insignificant, except for the sub-group of banks that changed their status of swap use at
least once, which we refer to as "starters". Most of these banks started hedging during
the sample period and therefore changed from non-users to users at least once. For this
sub-sample we find a structural parameter of 0.15, corresponding to a 0.24 sd increase of
the duration gap when a bank switches from being a non-user to a user, and significant
at the 1% level. As the majority of banks, around two-thirds, do not change their swap
use status once during the sample period, and either never use swaps or do so in all years,
too little intertemporal variation exists for the fixed effects estimator to deliver significant
results in the other three samples.
For the other explanatory variables, we find the same coefficient signs in the time-
series models as in the cross-sectional models. The only exemption is Size, which now
has significantly negative coefficients. Hence, as banks become larger, they decrease their
on-balance-sheet exposure resulting from term transformation. One explanation is that
bigger banks start engaging in other business lines that generate fee and trading income.
The significance of loan commitments decreases in the trading book sample, but is still
significant at the 10% level. The effect of competition shows ambiguous results. Whereas
decreasing competition induces non-trading book institutions to take on less risk, the
opposite holds for trading book banks.
The macroeconomic variables confirm the results from previous analysis. Banks in-
crease their duration gap when the yield curve becomes steeper and maturity transfor-
mation becomes more profitable. Similar results were found by Purnanandam (2007) and
Memmel and Schertler (2014). As the level of the short-term 1-year government yield is
highly collinear to the slope of the yield curve, we do not include it as an extra variable
but create an interaction term with the slope instead. These interaction terms are signifi-
cantly negative and confirm theories related to the risk-taking channel of monetary policy
(Borio and Zhu, 2012). Jiménez et al. (2014) find that short-term instead of long-term
rates matter for banks' risk taking. During times of high short-term rates, when short-
term lending funded with deposits that pay less than market rates is also profitable, banks
engage in less maturity transformation (Panel B). Interestingly, banks decrease their du-
ration gap in times of uncertainty in interbank markets, measured by a higher spread of
the 1-year EURIBOR over the 1-year government rate (Panel C and D). However, when
interbank uncertainty arises contemporaneously with a steep yield curve, banks decrease

their maturity mismatch less drastically as there are still profits to earn from maturity
transformation (Panel D).
Again, the instruments swap use experience and average board experience are strong
instruments, even in a time-series setting where variables have been demeaned in order to
eliminate the time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. Kleibergen-Paap statistics from
the first-stage instrumentation process are again above the rule-of-thumb threshold, i.e.,
the F-statistic should exceed a value of 10, as well as above the critical threshold posted
by Stock and Yogo (2005) for the size distortion derived from the Cragg-Donald statistic,
which is 19.93 given a single endogenous variable being instrumented with two variables.
Hansen-J tests of overidentification cannot reject the null of valid, exogenous instruments
at a 10% level for all regressions and samples being run. The endogeneity tests of interest
rate swap use cannot be rejected at a 10% level for the total, the non-trading book and the
trading book sample, -- as for the cross-sectional regression models -- but exogeneity is
rejected for the sample of starters. However, this finding depends on the macroeconomic
covariates included and does not hold for Panel B where the yield curve slope and its
intercation with the 1-year interest rate are included.
6.2 Interest Rate Swap Use Decision
In this section we analyze the determinants of the use of interest rate swaps by applying
pooled probit models into which we include macroeconomic variables. The results are
presented in Table 8. Again, the baseline model in Panel A includes time dummies,
whereas the other model specifications use the same sets of macroeconomic variables as
in the time-series setting of the duration gap analysis.
Maturity gap has the expected positive coefficients, always significant at the 1% level.
Pure banking book institutions show a three to four times higher sensitivity to on-balance-
sheet IRR than trading book institutions. In the baseline model the presented structural
coefficients translate into an increase in the propensity to use interest rate swaps by 46%,
60%, 25%, and 28% given a 1 sd increase for the overall sample, pure banking book
institutions, trading book banks, and starters, respectively. Therefore, the underlying
on-balance IRR is a driver of high economic magnitude for the decision to use interest
rate swaps.
The sign of the coefficient of the PD provides evidence for the predictions of risk
management theory (Froot et al., 1993; Froot and Stein, 1998). The higher the default
risk and the associated cost of bankruptcy, the higher the propensity to use interest rate
swaps. Again, the sensitivity of trading book financial intermediaries, which are more
likely to depend on their credit rating in interbank and capital markets, is higher in
magnitude. The coefficient of 0.095 in the baseline model of Panel A corresponds to a
23% higher propensity to employ interest rate swaps given a one sd increase in the log
of the PD. However, these banks might use interest rate swaps, at least partly, also for
speculation purposes. Also for banks, we find the empirically well-documented effect that
larger entities are more likely to use OBS derivatives. This is most likely due to economies
of scale in establishing risk management departments that are proficient enough to use
interest rate swaps.
So far, all our results are consistent with those of Purnanandam (2007). The major
difference are the coefficients related to bank liquidity measures, for which Purnanandam

finds significantly negative relationships. We find that savings deposits have no impact
on the interest rate swap use decision. The buffer stock of liquid assets is found to be in-
significant for trading book institutions, but significantly negative for pure banking book
intermediaries. This indicates that these banks consider liquid assets to be a complemen-
tary hedging tool, whereas risk management theory stresses the substitutionary relation
(e.g., Bolton et al., 2011). One potential explanation for this finding lies in the role
that liquidity buffers have in the theory of intertemporal smoothing of non-diversifiable
liquidity and interest rate risk (Allen and Gale, 1997).
Competition is not found to have an effect on banks' likelihood to use swaps, although
theory would have suggested so (Adam et al., 2007). Zhu (2011) finds significant effects
from hedging on competition and vice versa. However, she investigates unregulated in-
dustries' commodity price hedging. In the regulated banking industry, competition has
no effect on the decision to use swaps after controlling for all the other determinants that
affect interest rate risk taking.
Past swap experience has the expected positive sign and coefficients are far above 1,
significant at the 1% level in all samples and regression setups. Average board experience,
on the other hand, reduces the likelihood of using interest rate swaps and is always
conveniently significant at 5%. The negative effects are most pronounced for trading
book institutions. These results contradict those found in the literature hitherto. Zhu
(2012) finds that younger and therefore less experienced CEOs are less likely to use OBS
hedging. Our results suggest that experience does not seem to be an indicator for risk
aversion.
The macroeconomic variables serve as indicators of market timing in hedging deci-
sions. Pure banking book institutions are less likely to use swaps when the yield curve is
steep (Panel B). As non-trading book banks can use interest rate swaps only for hedging
purposes, they hedge less of their floating-rate debt exposure in times when corporates
also hedge less (Faulkender, 2005; Vickery, 2008). For trading book banks, we find in-
significant or significantly positive relationships. Here, it has to be taken into account
that these banks can use interest rate swaps for speculation on the yield curve and pos-
itive coefficients can indicate increasing off-balance-sheet IRR exposure. The interaction
term with the 1-year yield is significantly negative for all samples (Panel B).16 Interbank
funding uncertainty increases banks' likelihood of using interest rate swaps (Panel C and
D). Interestingly, both the overall and aggregate sectoral -- calculated separately for sav-
ings, cooperative, and private banks -- interest rate swap use quotas are highly correlated
with the EURIBOR spread. Hence, funding uncertainty seems to be a major driver of the
swap use decision on an industry level. This is further evidence for the dynamic risk man-
agement theories that incorporate liquidity issues into hedging decisions. Furthermore,
our finding is supported by the increasing use of overnight index swaps in the banking
industry. Again, when uncertainty is accompanied by a steep yield curve making term
transformation profitable, the effect of the EURIBOR spread becomes smaller (Panel D).
Customer loans and loan commitments are relevant instruments with Kleibergen-Paap
F-statistics always above 10 and, again, also always above the size distortion threshold
16It should be noted that the elasticities of interacted variables in probit models should be interpreted
with caution as the correction proposed by Ai and Norton (2003) has not been applied. However, we
derive similar coefficients in magnitude for the interacted and all other variables from linear probability
models (LPM).

of 19.93 reported by Stock and Yogo (2005) in the case of homoscedastic standard errors.
Instrument validity is supported using overidentification tests that are insignificant at a
10% level for all samples being estimated. The exogeneity tests of Smith and Blundell
(1986) only cannot be rejected at a 10% level for the sample of trading book institutions.
This indicates that the maturity gap seems to be an exogenous driver of their decision
to hold swaps, but exogeneity is rejected for all other samples, including the sub-samples
of non-trading book banks and starters. However, for the starter sample the test statisic
depends on the macroeconomic covariates included and decreases when the EURIBOR
spread is included. For Panels C and D exogeneity can only be rejected at 9% and 7.3%
level which is not too far from the 10% threshold usually employed.
6.3 Extent of Interest Rate Swap Use
6.3.1 Cross-Sectional Variation
Table 9 shows the cross-sectional results of the extent of interest rate swaps for between
effects and a pooled specification. For trading book banks, only three variables are found
to be significant. These are the PD, which increases the extent of interest rate swap
use, Size, which also has a significantly positive impact, and the Past swap experience.
Although only three variables are significant, the R-squares are higher for the trading book
bank samples than for the pure banking book institution samples. As the cross-sectional
estimators should explain constant extent of swap use, whereas we cannot distinguish
whether interest rate swaps are used for speculation or hedging purposes, the assumptions
underlying the estimators may be violated. The results for the trading book sub-sample
should therefore be interpreted with caution.
For the sample of pure banking book institutions, we find results in line with those
Purnanandam (2007) obtained when he investigated interest derivatives for hedging pur-
poses. Banks with higher duration gaps hold significantly more interest rate swaps, and
banks with a higher cost of distress also increase their swap use to hedge IRR, consistent
with the implications for the risk management behavior of unconstrained firms in cor-
porate finance theory. As for trading book banks, Size also shows significantly positive
coefficients.
Liquidity endowments, in general, reduce the volume of swaps held. This is consistent
with the predictions of modern dynamic risk management theory, where cash is considered
a substitute for hedging activities (e.g., Bolton et al., 2011). Savings deposits as an
indicator of stable funding sources significantly reduce the extent of interest rate swap
use. The same holds for the buffer of liquid assets, however, only when a between estimator
is used. Again, competition has no influence on the extent of interest rate swap use in
a regulated industry. Controlling for sample selection bias is only necessary for the pure
banking book sample and the total sample, but not for the trading book sample.17
Again, for the pooled models, Kleibergen-Paap statistics for weak instruments are
always clearly above 10 and also above the threshold of 19.93 calculated for the Cragg-
Donald statistic for a maximum size distortion of 10%. Hence, customer loans and loan
17The reduction of sample size conditional on using swaps is most substantial for non-trading book
institutions, while the observations in the trading book sample drop only slightly. Observations decrease
by more than two-thirds in the pure banking book sample from 17,166 to 5,725, whereas the reduction
is only around 20% for the banking book institutions, from 2,170 to 1,701.

duration gap being instrumented with customer loans and loan commitments. Kleibergen-Paap F -stat. is the weak instruments statistic. The overidentification test
displays the test statistic of Lee (1992). The endogeneity test the 2 Wald statistic of Smith and Blundell (1986). Standard errors in parentheses are bootstrapped with

commitments are also relevant instruments for the reduced sample of banks that decided
to use interest rate swaps. Instrument validity is supported by overidentification tests
which all fail to reject the null with p-values conveniantely above 50%. The endogeneity
tests reject the null of exogeneity of the modified duration gap for all three samples
clearly. Thus, the modified duration gap is indeed an endogenous determinant of the
nominal volume of interest rate swaps held by German universal banks.
6.3.2 Time-Series Variation
In a time-series setting -- results are presented in Table 10 -- the duration gap has a
positive and even larger impact on the extent of interest rate swap use than in the cross-
sectional settings. To address problems of unobserved heterogeneity, endogeneity, and
sample selection, we estimate these models following Semykina and Wooldridge (2010).
In the baseline model, a one sd increase in the duration gap leads to a rise in the extent
of interest rate swap use by 1.22, 0.86, 1.10, and 1.01 sd for the overall, the non-trading
book, the trading book and the starter sample, respectively. None of these coefficients
can statistically be distinguished from 1. This might be an indicator that German banks
try indeed to keep their hedge ratios constant over time in relation to their on-balance
IRR. In contrast to the cross-sectional regressions, we do not find a significant influence
of the probability of default in any of the regressions run on the extent of swap use.
However, it should be kept in mind, that the strength of hidden liabilities in the hazard
rate model did not fully match the requirements of being a strong instrument. Also,
liquid asset endowments as well as savings deposits are found to be insignificant. These
results stand in contrast to our cross-sectional findings and also to the time-series models
of Purnanandam (2007), who finds a significantly negative impact for both variables. Size
has a significantly positive impact on the extent of interest rate swap use and is larger
than in the cross-sectional regressions.
Kleibergen-Paap weak instrument statistics are even in the smallest cases close to 15,
and hence customer loans and loan commitments are strong instruments for the maturity
gap in the time-series sample selection setting. Hansen-J tests support the exclusion
restrictions as the null of instrument validity cannot be rejected conveniently at a 25%
level. The endogeneity tests reject the null of the maturity gap being exogenous for all
samples, as in the cross-sectional regressions.
6.4 Summary of Results from the Simultaneous Equations
6.4.1 Simultaneous Risk Management
For banks in the non-trading book sample, we find that more restrictive on-balance-sheet
IRR management -- resulting in lower maturity gaps and an intensified use of interest
rate swaps -- are substitute strategies. The coefficients derived for the probability of
default largely provide an empirical support for the behavior of unconstrained firms in
theoretical corporate finance risk management models. However, the proxy for profitable
growth opportunities -- the growth rate of total assets -- is mostly insignificant. In
robustness checks, this also holds for the growth rate of customer loans, and total loans,
and if we choose real instead of nominal growth rates by deflating monetary volumes. The
market timing behavior we find for the slope of the yield curve is in line with the results

6.4.2 Exogeneity Tests
Table 11 summarizes the results from the exogeneity tests of the potentially endogenous
explanatory variables within the simultaneous regression framework. As the results for
the cross-sectional and the time-series regressions do not differ, no differentiation is made.
We also display only the results for the total sample and the sample of banks starting to
use interest rate swaps for the first time, and for trading book banks for the swap use
decisions.
The decision to use interest rate swaps is only endogenous to the maturity gap for the
sub-sample of banks that start hedging during the sample period. For all other banks,
including the total sample which is dominated by banks that either use interest rate swaps
in all years or do not use them in any year, the decision is exogenous. The duration gap
is an endogenous determinant of the decision to use interest rate swaps even for starters.
It is only for trading book institutions that exogeneity cannot be rejected. With regard
to the extent of interest rate swaps held conditional on a positive decision to use interest
rate swaps at all, the maturity gap is always endogenous.
We interpret the results as follows. The decision to use interest rate swaps and the ex-
tent of their use seem mainly driven by the contemporaneous IRR regulation in Germany,
whereas the maturity gap seems to be largely determined by borrower and lender liquidity
preferences. Banks that face the decision to newly start employing interest rate swaps are
likely to have a maturity gap close to the threshold of being considered an "outlier" bank
by the regulator. "Outliers" lose more than 20% of their regulatory equity in a simulated
130 basis point parallel upward shift of the yield curve.18 Starters face the decision of pay-
ing the one-time initial cost of establishing a derivatives hedging department, becoming
an "outlier" bank that exceeds the regulatory threshold19 or, alternatively, rejecting the
loan maturity borrowers demand. In contrast, banks whose exposure is far away from the
threshold or those whose exposure is above the threshold but which have already initiated
an OBS risk management desk in order to comply with the IRR regulation can offer any
18The IRR regulation was revised in the fourth quarter of 2011. The relevant interest rate shock has
been increased to 200 basis points and banks are no longer referred to as "outliers" but as institutions with
"elevated interest rate risk". For more details of the IRR regulation, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2012).
Excluding observations from the end of 2011, when the new regulatory framework became effective, does
not change our results.
19Banks decrease overall IRR exposure drastically after having been classified as an "outlier" (Memmel,
2011).

loan maturity borrowers demand and accept all volumes of short-term deposits. Hence,
only for starters the decision to use interest rate swaps is endogenous to the maturity gap.
The IRR regulation in Germany can also explain the more pronounced use of interest
rate derivatives in Germany compared to the U.S., although the intertemporal smoothing
theory of Allen and Gale (1997) predicts a higher propensity of derivative use for the U.S.
German universal banks seem to use interest rate swaps predominantly for compliance
with the IRR regulation and not to manage liquidity risk.20
We additionally account the finding that the interest swap use dummy is exogenous
for most samples to the fact that German banks' maturity mismatch is largely deter-
mined by customers' liquidity needs. Research on borrowers' preferences reveals that
loan size is most sensitive to the maturity being offered, whereas interest rate sensitivity
is less pronounced. These findings are interpreted as the existence of binding borrower
liquidity constraints (e.g., Karlan and Zinman, 2008; Attanasio, Koujianou Goldberg,
and Kyriazidou, 2008). Germany's legal and institutional environment provides banks
with incentives to supply borrowers with long-term liquidity if demanded. In the German
bank-dominated financial system only few large corporates have access to equity and debt
capital markets, whereas the majority of Germany's small and medium-sized enterprises,
known as the "Mittelstand", depend completely on banks with which they most often
have longstanding relationships. Additionally households have most of their savings as
deposits with banks (e.g., Allen and Santomero, 2001).
Major determinants of the loan maturity being granted by a bank are the degrees of
information asymmetry and moral hazard that are inherent to the borrower relationship.
Ways to mitigate the maturity-reducing impact of the aforementioned factors are pledging
collateral and relationship lending. The German "Hausbank" principle is one of the
strongest forms of relationship lending. Additionally, most often commercial property or
real estate is pledged as collateral and valued quite conservatively. Therefore, German
banks are likely to offer the same long-term loans as banks in the U.K., although Germany
offers less favorable creditor rights (Davydenko and Franks, 2008; Qian and Strahan,
2007). The property rights prevailing in Germany are among the most friendly what
additionally facilitates granting long-term loans (Bae and Goyal, 2009). To sum up, the
German legal and institutional environment helps to reduce moral hazard, and therefore
banks seem to be able and willing to offer their lenders the maturities they demand.
Given this setting, it appears plausible that the decision to use swaps is exogenous to
the maturity gap, except for those banks that face the decision to set up a derivatives
department for the first time. Banks at the "outlier" threshold which decide to manage
IRR solely on the balance sheet are likely to use their interbank lending and borrowing
to adjust their maturity gap endogenously (Ehrmann and Worms, 2004).
Our findings thus indicate that banks use interest rate swaps predominantly for hedg-
ing purposes in compliance with IRR regulation. Pure banking book institutions seem
at first to choose the magnitude of their maturity gap based on liquidity demand. Af-
terwards, they decide on the extent of swaps that is necessary in order not to exceed the
"outlier" threshold. With regard to the set-up of our simultaneous equation framework,
20We are not aware of a similar "outlier" threshold with regard to a potential equity loss in the Economic
Value Model applied by the Federal Reserve to investigate U.S. commercial banks' IRR, although a 200
basis point shift in the yield curve is also simulated. The threshold seems more likely to be one comparing
banks relative IRR (Houpt and Embersit, 1991) than an absolute one.
34
we summarize that the decision to use swaps and the maturity gap do not necessarily
have to be estimated simultaneously, except for banks that start using derivatives for the
first time.
7 Conclusion
Modeling German universal banks' IRR management as the simultaneous choice of on-
balance-sheet maturity gap management and OBS interest rate swap use, we find that
both decisions serve as substitutes for one another. The effect of bankruptcy risk on
risk management decisions is consistent with the predictions of corporate finance models
for financially unconstrained firms. Being faced with a higher default likelihood makes
banks pursue more conservative on-balance-sheet portfolio management with less maturity
mismatch, and increases their propensity to hedge on-balance-sheet risk with interest rate
swaps.
Our empirical findings are largely in line with those of Purnanandam (2007) who
investigates IRR management for U.S. commercial banks. One major exemption is the
effect that liquid assets have on the use of interest rate derivatives. U.S. banks manage
buffer stocks of liquid assets as substitutes to OBS hedging in line with the theoretical
impact predicted by dynamic risk management theories. German universal banks, on
the other hand, consider liquidity buffers complementary risk management strategies to
the decision to hold interest rate swaps. Once banks decide to employ interest rate
swaps, the extent of their use serves as a substitute for liquid assets. The differences
in managing liquidity and interest rate risk on the balance sheet or off the balance sheet
have been stressed by Allen and Santomero (2001) based on the theoretical model of Allen
and Gale (1997). U.S. banks are more likely to manage risks using derivative hedging,
whereas German banks can rely more heavily on on-balance-sheet risk management due
to intertemporal smoothing.
The reason why we nevertheless observe more banks in Germany using OBS risk man-
agement instruments than in the U.S., is the outcome of the IRR regulation in Germany.
Exogeneity tests on the endogenous regressors in the simultaneous equations suggest that
swap use is exogenous to the magnitude of the duration gap. Hence, banks seem first
to decide on their duration gap, which is driven by the liquidity preferences of their cus-
tomers. Afterwards, they make their decisions on using interest rate swaps. This holds
for all banks, except for banks that start using interest rate swaps for the first time. Only
these banks simultaneously decide on their maturity mismatch and the use of interest rate
swaps.
We find market timing behavior in IRR management in samples of banks that are
by law prohibited from engaging in substantial OBS speculation. Our results show that
banks are willing to take more IRR when a steep yield curve makes maturity transfor-
mation profitable. Funding uncertainty in the interbank markets urges banks to reduce
on-balance-sheet risk by means of derivatives hedging. High levels of short-term nominal
interest rates induce banks to further reduce IRR exposure. This finding is consistent
with the risk-taking channel of monetary policy. Including macroeconomic variables does
not change the relationship between on-balance exposure and interest swap use decisions,
and therefore the speculative element in market timing appears minor compared to the
dominant effect that on-balance and off-balance IRR management serve as substitutes.
35
Our research has strong implications for banking supervisory authorities as the design
of IRR regulation has a major impact on banks' decision to hedge on-balance-sheet risk
with OBS derivatives. As OBS derivatives only allow for trading the interest rate but not
(fully) the liquidity risk, there is room for future research to investigate how a combined
interest rate and liquidity risk regulation, as proposed by Basel III, with the Liquidity
Coverage Ratio and the Net Stable Funding Ratio, will affect banks' portfolio structures.
For banks in market-based and bank-based financial systems which both adopt Basel III,
it will be interesting to observe whether the theoretical predictions from Allen and Gale's
model on the relation between liquid assets and OBS risk management still holds after
liquidity risk becomes more heavily regulated.

Appendix A Variable Description
Table 12 gives an overview of the variables used in the hazard rate model and the interest
rate risk management analysis and how these variables were calculated.
Appendix B Modified Duration Gap
Time-to-maturity is defined either as the remaining time-to-maturity or as the time re-
maining until the next repricing. The modified duration gap is calculated by first assign-
ing the modified durations of the standard BaFin approach to the maturity brackets, and
then summing up the volume-weighted assets' and liabilities' time-to-maturity brackets.
The modified duration gap can then be calculated from the modified asset and liability
duration by
Dgap
= DA
mod
- DL
mod
total interest-earning liabilities
total interest-paying assets
,
where total interest-bearing assets (liabilities) is the sum of business volume reported
in the time-to-maturity brackets. Information on assets' remaining time to maturity is
available for loans to banks and non-banks. For liabilities' remaining time to maturity in
addition to loans from banks and non-banks, are also available for savings accounts and
bonds issued. For each of these categories, four maturity brackets have been collected
ranging from three months or less, more than three months up to one year, more than a
year up to five years, and finally, more than five years. The modified duration assigned to
these brackets are 0.16, 0.71, 3.07, and 5.08, respectively. In order to eliminate unrealistic
outliers, we drop all banks that report negative volumes in any of the time-to-maturity
brackets. Additionally, we require that three out of the four brackets reported for loans
to and from non-banks have non-zero volume.
