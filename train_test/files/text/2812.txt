Research Summary
The results of recent empirical research have shown that juveniles do not achieve
complete psychosocial maturity until postadolescence and that processing juveniles as
adults in the criminal justice system can be associated with elevated rates of criminal
recidivism. In response to these as well as other concerns, several states have recently
raised their legal ages of majority in the hopes of reducing juvenile offending rates.
Connecticut enacted one such law change when it raised its age of majority from 16 to
17 in 2010 and then from 17 to 18 in 2012 for all but the most serious offenses. The
effect of Connecticut's policy change on juvenile crime is examined in this study. To
discern between changes in juvenile offending and changes in the propensity of police to
arrest youthful offenders in the aftermath of a law change, we use two methodological
approaches. Synthetic control methods are used to generate triple-differences estimates
of the effect of Connecticut's policy change on juvenile arrests and overall crime rates
by using a weighted average of other U.S. states as a natural comparison group. Next,
by analyzing National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data for a subset
of Connecticut's local jurisdictions, we examine changes in age-specific juvenile arrests
and changes in age-specific juvenile offending. The resulting evidence suggests that no

discernable change in juvenile offending occurred. In addition, evidence exists that in
some Connecticut jurisdictions, officer, rather than juvenile, behavior was impacted by
this law change.
Policy Implications
Although raise-the-age policies may remain desirable for other policy reasons, no robust
evidence of their effects on crime is yet available. Given the absence of such evidence of
crime effects, policy makers interested in raise-the-age policies for their crime-reduction
benefits might consider focusing on other juvenile justice policy initiatives with demon-
strated crime-reduction benefits. Nevertheless, policy makers interested in these policies
for other policy reasons can rest assured that there is no evidence that these policies
exacerbate juvenile crime. The results of this study also suggest that the effects of "raise-
the-age" policies on crime will be difficult to separate from recent declining trends in
juvenile crime and arrests as well as from changes in police arrest decision making.

According to the results from recent research, juveniles, particularly males, do not
reach psychosocial maturity until well into their 20s (Cauffman, 2012; Steinberg
and Cauffman, 1996). This finding has implications for the culpability and the
reformability of juvenile offenders, particularly older juvenile offenders, who are often tried
as adults and sent to adult prisons. If juveniles do not fully mature until postadolescence,
scholars have argued, then juveniles who offend before reaching this threshold should not
be subject to the adult criminal justice system with its greater emphasis on punishment
rather than on rehabilitation (Farrington, Loeber, and Howell, 2012; National Academy of
Sciences, 2013). In light of these arguments, over the last decade, several states with sub-18
ages of majority have actively considered expanding the jurisdiction of their juvenile courts
by increasing the maximum jurisdictional age to 18 for all but the most serious criminal
offenses (Brown, 2012). Several states, including Illinois, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Mis-
sissippi, and New Hampshire, have already done so in whole or in part. Proponents of
these changes argue that raising the age of majority, and thus, expanding the juvenile justice
system, will reduce crime by increasing affected juveniles' access to the more abundant treat-
ment opportunities available in the juvenile justice system and by limiting their exposure to
the more harmful aspects of the adult justice system. They further argue that the decrease in
crime will, on balance, produce cost savings in the long run that will offset the higher costs
of processing juvenile arrestees as juveniles (Henrichson and Levshin, 2011).1 Opponents
1. In North Carolina, the additional cost of processing an individual as a juvenile rather than as an adult has
been estimated to be as follows: arrest ($249), detention ($181.90), court and adjudication costs
($213­$1,230), counselors ($175), and programming ($1,400­$15,000) (Henrichson and Levshin, 2011).

counter that at least some older teen offenders are more appropriately handled in the adult
justice system and that raising the age of majority may increase juvenile crime by reducing
the deterrence value of an arrest (Gibson and Krohn, 2012).
Altering the age of majority also raises important questions regarding processing effects
for the large number of first-time and nonserious offenders who are shifted between these two
judicial systems by these policies. Although a substantial literature on juvenile transfer has
been developed in recent years documenting the consequences of transferring serious and/or
repeat juvenile felony offenders into the adult justice system (Bishop, Frazier, Lanza-Kaduce,
and Winner, 1996; Fagan, 1996; Lanza-Kaduce, Bishop, and Frazier, 2005; McGowan et al.,
2007; Mulvey and Schubert, 2012; Puzzanchera and Addie, 2010; Redding, 2010), such
transfers are relatively rare--of the 1.5 million juvenile delinquency cases in 2009, only
7,600 were transferred into the adult justice system (Knoll and Sickmund, 2012). Far less
is known about the public safety consequences of moving more commonplace juvenile
offenders between these two systems (Loeffler and Grunwald, 2015b). If newly retained
juveniles benefit from a reduction in the age of criminal majority, then crime can potentially
be reduced by raising the age of majority. Nevertheless, the opposite could be true if the
absence of a credible deterrent leads juveniles to engage in more and more serious criminal
activity.
The short-term effects of "raise-the-age" policies on crime have been estimated in
several recent papers. The results of an early investigation of Connecticut's raise-the-age
law, which involved comparing 16-year-olds arrested before and after the law change,
suggested that it produced large reductions in juvenile recidivism (Justice Policy Institute,
2013). A more recent evaluation of Illinois' law change, which included counterfactual
comparison groups consisting of juveniles arrested weeks before the Illinois law change or
weeks before their 17th birthday after the law change, yielded little evidence of an effect
on juvenile recidivism (Loeffler and Grunwald, 2015a). Although many of the outstanding
methodological concerns of estimating the effects of raise-the-age policies at the individual
level were addressed in this more recent study, identifying the aggregate-level crime effects
of raise-the-age policies remains a difficult challenge for two reasons.
To estimate the aggregate level effects of a juvenile justice policy like raise the age,
researchers must be able to identify a credible policy counterfactual to substitute for the
unobservable condition of what would have happened in the adopting jurisdiction if it had
retained the existing policy regime. The most common solution to this estimation problem is
to use a differences-in-differences framework, comparing the jurisdiction with itself (before-
and-after) as well as with neighboring jurisdictions under the assumption that the timing of
the policy shock is as good as random. Even though regression-based implementations of this
approach typically use all other states or neighboring states as counterfactual comparison
groups, neither of these serve as ideal counterfactual comparisons because of short-term
fluctuations in state crime rates. A further complication in the estimation of the crime
effects of "raise-the-age" legislation is the long-noted difficulty of separating changes in
Volume 16 r Issue 1 47
Research Article Raising the Age of Majority
offending from changes in the likelihood of police arrest (Black, 1970, 1971; Perlman,
1949; Smith and Visher, 1981; Wilson, 1951). This difficulty arises as a result of the absence
of age-specific offending statistics in most jurisdictions, leaving the analyst to depend on
age-specific arrest statistics as a proxy for the missing age-specific offending statistics.
Scholars have repeatedly expressed concerns that changes in police behavior could be
mistaken for changes in offender behavior, particularly if shifting arrest patterns are corre-
lated with the demographic characteristics of offenders. Although much of this scholarship
has been focused on the influence of impermissible factors, such as race, ethnicity, or gen-
der, this concern might be even greater for factors such as the offender age, where both
the civilian and the law enforcement communities may have strong preferences regarding
the appropriateness and usefulness of arresting children and adolescents (Goldman, 1963;
Landau, 1981; Novak, Frank, Smith, and Engel, 2002; Piliavin and Briar, 1964; Smith and
Visher, 1981). A particularly concerning version of this problem could occur if officers are
less likely to arrest a 16-year-old in a world in which that 16-year-old will be adjudicated in
the juvenile justice system rather than in the adult justice system. If officers believe that such
an arrest is going to generate excessive processing burdens related to parental notification
or is less likely to lead to punishment and, in turn, decline to arrest certain juveniles, then
resulting models will be biased toward a finding that raising the age of majority reduces
juvenile offending even if juveniles offend at the same frequency. Ruhland, Gold, and
Hekman (1982) raised just such a possibility in their analysis of juvenile offending in states
with different ages of majority--highlighting long-standing concerns that differences in
statutory age boundaries could influence officer behavior as much as or more than they
influence juvenile offender behavior.
Such a concern also figures prominently in the applied microeconomics literature, in
which researchers have estimated the deterrence value of adult sanctions (Hjalmarsson, 2009;
Lee and McCrary, 2005, 2009). Despite these concerns, most information on individual
criminal offending behavior, particularly age-related criminal offending patterns, is derived
from police-generated arrest statistics, which are themselves generated from information
gathered after the arrest of an individual. This process filters the underlying offending data,
convolving offender behavior with officer preferences. If no other source of information
on the prevalence of crime is available, which it often is not, then it is difficult, if not
impossible, to distinguish these two different behavioral responses.
In this article, we provide two distinct tests for measuring the crime effects of state-
and age-specific criminal justice policies, which we illustrate by estimating the crime effects
of "raise-the-age" policies in the state of Connecticut. First, we use the method of synthetic
controls (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmuller, 2010) to examine whether arrests among
Connecticut juveniles in treated age groups changed relative to arrests among juveniles in
untreated age groups, compared with a weighted average of other U.S. states with similar
pre-2010 age-specific arrest trends. This methodology represents the synthetic control
analog to a triple-differences estimator using linear regression. Second, to test for changes in
48 Criminology & Public Policy
Loeffler and Chalfin
police officer behavior, we use incident-based data to compare individuals in treated versus
untreated age groups within Connecticut (i.e., 15-year-olds compared with 16-year-olds
and 16-year-olds compared with 17-year-olds). The primary innovation in these models is
to use information on the age of offenders that is provided by victims in cases that lead to
an arrest as well as those that do not lead to an arrest. As this information is not sensitive to
the police officer's choice to make an arrest, it is a purer measure of juvenile behavior than
are corresponding arrest data, which are most often used to estimate the crime effects of
juvenile justice policies on crime. The results of these tests provide no evidence that raising
the age of majority resulted in an increase in either juvenile arrest or juvenile offending.
Although point estimates are not sufficiently precise to make definitive claims, if anything,
the majority of the evidence suggests that juvenile offending either remained unchanged or
may have temporarily declined as a result of the policy change. These findings contribute
to the extant literature in several ways. First, they add to a growing literature in applied
microeconomics in which the relative insensitivity of juvenile offending behavior to the
sanctions to which juveniles are exposed has been documented, suggesting that studies in
the criminological literature with reports of substantial effects may have been estimated on
a different policy margin or that selection bias may have affected these studies. Second,
these results provide evidence in a key policy debate within the criminological literature,
indicating that shifting the age of majority is unlikely to have a significant effect on criminal
offending, at least in the short run (Cauffman, 2012; Farrington et al., 2012; Gibson and
Krohn, 2012). Finally, they demonstrate the importance of separating officer from offender
behavior, a first-order and, to date, unaddressed problem in the evaluation of age-specific
crime policies.
Raising the Age of Majority
In 2006 and 2007, the Connecticut legislature considered extending the juvenile court
jurisdiction to include 16- and 17-year-olds who were, at the time, tried as adults.2 Pro-
ponents argued that greater access to rehabilitative programming in the juvenile justice
system was essential to address the underlying causes of teenage offending in addition to
achieving other policy goals, including reducing the risk of juvenile victimization in the
adult justice system and diminished culpability (Poitras, 2007b). Opponents, including
several Connecticut police chiefs, argued that shifting 16- and 17-year-old arrestees into
the juvenile justice system would overwhelm the already overcrowded juvenile system as
well as expose younger children in the juvenile system to victimization by older adoles-
cents (Melone, 2007). As in many jurisdictions considering "raise-the-age" legislation at
this time (National Campaign to Reform State Juvenile Justice Systems [NCRSJJS], 2013),
2. First-time offenders who were 16 or 17 years of age were eligible for youthful offender status, which
allowed for confidentiality of proceedings and expungement of records, but affected juveniles were
nevertheless processed through the adult justice system.
Volume 16 r Issue 1 49
Research Article Raising the Age of Majority
proponents not only pointed to the additional rehabilitative needs of still-maturing juveniles
as justification for treating juveniles as juveniles but also referenced the higher recidivism
rates observed among juveniles processed as adults in several academic studies (Poitras,
2007a). These same studies were also interpreted as suggesting that crime rates would be
lower in Connecticut after the age of majority was raised, more than making up for the
additional costs of processing juveniles as juveniles (Roman, 2006).3
Once the law change was passed in 2007, concerns remained about the capacity
of the juvenile justice system to absorb the influx of 16-year-olds when the first stage of
the law went into effect in 2010 (Morganteen, 2009).4 Some jurisdictions reported lack of
guidance and police confusion over its implementation, which led officers to release juveniles
with warnings in lieu of arrest (Backus, 2011). Despite these implementation challenges,
observers pointed to several positive changes in the crime situation involving 16-year-olds as
evidence of the new law's success. These changes included slightly lower rates of recidivism
among 16-year-olds arrested and newly processed in the juvenile justice system (State of
Connecticut, 2012; Weinreb, 2014). They also interpreted decreases in juvenile arrests
coinciding with the 2010 change as evidence of the policy's effects (Justice Policy Institute,
2013). To date, however, no evaluation has indicated whether this crime reduction is in
fact larger than those observed in national trends or than month-to-month jurisdictional
variability. Moreover, to the extent that the observed crime reduction represents the effect
of the policy changes, it remains to be seen whether it is the result of changes in juvenile
offending behavior, officer arrest behavior, or some other mechanism leading to year-to-year
fluctuations in juvenile crime rates.
Juvenile Offending and Age
The enactment of changes to the age of majority raises a fundamental theoretical question in
criminology--are offenders, particularly young offenders, sensitive to changes in statutory
penalties or other changes in how their cases are handled by the justice system? If so,
consistent with deterrence theory (Nagin, 1998; Zimring, 1976), juveniles processed in the
adult system, as well as juvenile offenders threatened with processing in the adult system,
should be less likely to offend, less frequent in their offending, or less likely to engage in
serious offending. If, on the other hand, processing juveniles as adults denies them essential
services or otherwise exposes them to particularly harmful aspects of the adult justice system,
then secondary deviance in the form of escalated or additional offending could be generated,
canceling out or even swamping any deterrent effects (National Academy of Sciences, 2013).
Finally, differential processing of juveniles could result in no discernable effect on crime if
juveniles are unaware or indifferent to the existence of these alternatives and the systems
3. Contemporaneous estimates placed the benefit­cost ratio at 3 to 1 (Roman, 2006).
4. Connecticut implemented its higher age of majority in two discrete policy shifts--raising the age of
majority from 16 to 17 in 2010 and from 17 to 18 in 2012.

differ less, for the modal offender, than anticipated (Feld, 1997; Wolfgang, Thornberry, and
Figlio, 1987).
Changes to the statutory age of majority also implicate a foundational measurement
problem in criminology--separating the possible behavioral responses of juveniles from the
possible behavioral responses of law enforcement officers--because changes to legal policies,
penalties, and procedures can simultaneously alter the costs of responding to and committing
crime. Despite widespread recognition among scholars that the filtering of criminal statistics
through the recording behavior of police officers poses a complex measurement challenge
(Black, 1970, 1971; Perlman, 1949; Smith and Visher, 1981; Wilson, 1951), there has been
little quantitative research conducted on the possible adaptive behavior of law enforcement
officials to the existence or modification of juvenile jurisdictional boundaries. Recently,
however, in a few applied microeconomics papers, in which juvenile offending on either
side of a jurisdictional boundary was examined, both of these questions were discussed by
the authors.5
The earliest such paper, by Levitt (1998), involved an investigation into whether the
fraction of the statewide crime rate attributable to juveniles was sensitive to the location
of the age of majority or the relative punitiveness of a jurisdiction's juvenile and adult
justice systems. In a mixed finding for deterrence theory, Levitt reported sizable declines
in age-specific crime rates just after the age of majority, but little evidence that the relative
punitiveness of a state's juvenile or adult justice system explained this result. To overcome the
unavailability of an age-specific offending rate, Levitt imputed the age-specific offending rate
from the age-specific arrest rate and the overall nonage-adjusted crime rate. Hjalmarsson
(2009) resolved this measurement problem without resorting to imputation when she
examined self-report data on offending and perceived probability of punishment from a
nationally representative longitudinal sample of juveniles. She reported elevated perceptions
of the probability of punishment after the age of majority (Hjalmarsson, 2009). Nevertheless,
the magnitude of her finding was much smaller than that reported in Levitt (1998). She
also reported no evidence of differences in self-reported offending behavior on either side
of the age of majority.
Lee and McCrary (2009), in a working paper that was the first to apply the regression
discontinuity methodology to the question of juvenile offending, reported minimal effects
of the age of majority on the density of offending near the age boundary in a sample of
arrestees from Florida. They also reported only slight evidence in favor of the effect of
the age of majority on juvenile rearrest rates. Similarly, Loeffler and Grunwald (2015b) in
their study of juvenile offending in Chicago provided evidence of slightly lower recidivism
rates beyond the age of majority but no indication of substantial differences. The absence
of substantial changes in arrest rates across the jurisdictional boundaries in both of these

Research Article Raising the Age of Majority
studies, as in the study by Hjalmarsson, suggests that the behavioral effects of these adjacent
jurisdictions may be smaller than predicted by deterrence theory. Yet, given the possibility of
changes in officer behavior across these jurisdictional boundaries, the effects of the boundary
on juvenile behavior remains fundamentally unresolved.
The findings from these more recent studies also contrast with those from earlier work
in which robust, albeit heterogeneous, evidence of elevated levels of reoffending among
juveniles processed as adults was discovered (Bishop et al., 1996; Fagan, 1996; Lanza-
Kaduce et al., 2005; Loughran et al., 2010). Much of this earlier work, however, was
focused on juvenile transfer populations, the relatively small number of more serious or
frequent offenders, the approximately 1% to 5% of juvenile arrestees who were subject
to adult prosecution and punishment even though they fell below the relevant age of
majority (Bishop, 2000; Puzzanchera and Addie, 2014). Even though these earlier studies
contributed to the policy discussion surrounding raising the age of majority by providing
evidence that processing at least some juveniles as adults could counterproductively elevate
juvenile reoffending rates, the policies adopted in Connecticut and elsewhere generally
exclude many of these juvenile offenders from the juvenile justice system. For this reason,
their relevance and generalizability to the much larger population of juvenile offenders
subject to the expanded jurisdiction of the juvenile court under raise-the-age policies is
unknown.
The findings from the first published study on the effects of raising the age of majority
that involved a comparison of the affected juveniles with a credible comparison group
unaffected by the law provided little evidence of all but the smallest of possible effects
on reoffending of raising the age of majority for misdemeanors (Loeffler and Grunwald,
2015a). The findings of this study, when coupled with those from other recent studies on
the age­crime relationship near the age of majority, suggested that the effects of processing
nontransfer juvenile offenders as adults may be much smaller than the effects anticipated
by proponents of raise-the-age policies. Still, this work was primarily focused on only one
element of the crime equation--criminal reoffending. It is possible that juvenile offending
could be affected beyond those directly processed, which would lead to a change in the
density of offending even if there was no change in the probability of reoffending conditional
on arrest.
Although the aggregate-level effects of a shift in the entire age boundary between
the juvenile and adult justice systems have not been explored recently, the findings from
evaluations of prior and more limited changes to the exclusive jurisdiction of the juvenile
justice system have provided limited evidence for such cohort-wide behavioral effects (Jensen
and Metsger, 1994; Risler, Sweatman, and Nackerud, 1998; Singer and McDowall, 1988).
Weak evidence has generally been found for the importance of boundary changes. It is
possible, given the narrower focus of those changes, that the broader change of shifting
the entire age of majority will produce different results. Nonetheless, the totality of the
available evidence suggests that any observed effects will be small in magnitude and that
52 Criminology & Public Policy
Loeffler and Chalfin
any bias could run in either direction given that the estimated effect of such a law change
is the averaging of the opposite signed causal mechanism of unknown relative magnitude
predicted by deterrence and rehabilitative theories.
The effects of shifting the age of majority on law enforcement behavior, independent
of any effects on juvenile offending behavior, are more difficult to predict. There is certainly
reason to suspect that officers could be more hesitant to arrest a 16-year-old caught in the
act of shoplifting when that juvenile will be processed in the juvenile justice system rather
than in the adult justice system. Making such an arrest when the 16-year-old is subject to
the juvenile justice system instead of to the adult justice system likely adds to the amount
of work that the officer must do. He or she can no longer simply detain and transport the
arrestee in addition to filing an arrest report. He or she must now locate and notify the
16-year-old's parent or guardian and likely remain with the juvenile until that guardian has
arrived or the juvenile has been evaluated for temporary detention. As the most likely result
of this arrest is the release of the juvenile to the care and custody of his or her guardian within
hours of arrest, many officers may come to believe that the arrest is not worth making (Lee
and McCrary, 2009). Even though several observers have noted this possibility, the absence
of systematic empirical evidence makes it difficult to predict how large such an influence
might be.
Data, Method, and Results
In 2010, with the implementation of the first phase of Connecticut's modified juvenile
offender law, the state saw a decline in the number of 16-year-old juveniles who were
arrested (see Figure 1). This decline appeared to contemporary observers to be steeper than
the decline for other age groups, particularly 15-year-old offenders (Justice Policy Institute,
2013). Nevertheless, Connecticut, like most other states in the United States, experienced a
substantial secular decline in juvenile arrests throughout this period, a trend that accelerated
in 2009, complicating a simple analysis of yearly data (Puzzanchera, 2013). To determine
the average treatment effect of the 2010 law change and to resolve the measurement problem
caused by missing age-specific offending information in many of the studies in the existing
literature, we employ two different estimation strategies--synthetic matching at the state
level and a differences-in-differences estimator at the individual level using age-specific arrest
and offender information.
State-Level Synthetic Control Comparison
The effects of aggregate-level policy interventions have been examined in a large criminology
literature that uses observational data. The standard approach to estimating the treatment
effect of such policy interventions is to compare an outcome, typically crime, before and after
the intervention in geographic units that were treated to the evolution of the outcome in a
sample of geographic units that were not treated. This approach, known as "differences-in-
differences" (D-D), is easily implemented by using least-squares regression and has become

ubiquitous in empirical social science research. The standard approach to computing D-
D estimates of the effect of a state-level policy shock is to regress a state- and time-
varying outcome, Yit; on a treatment dummy, Dit; a vector of time-varying covariates,
Xit; and state and time fixed effects. In this framework, the coefficient on Dit can be
interpreted as the causal estimate of the effect of the intervention so long as the timing of
the intervention is random, conditional on the other variables in the model. Another way
to state the identifying assumption of differences-in-differences is that the treated states and
the comparison states would have experienced parallel trends in the dependent variable but
for the treatment. In the case of the 2010 law change, under this assumption, Connecticut
and comparison states would have experienced the same fluctuations in the juvenile arrest
rate for individuals of different ages but for the decision to raise the age of criminal
majority. The standard methods of constructing a state comparison group include the use
of unweighted regressions, which implicitly assumes that comparison states and treatment
states experience common trends; the use of population weighted regressions, which assumes
that states with similarly sized populations are the best comparisons for the treated state; or a
manually selected comparison group, which assumes that the researcher can credibly identify
comparison states by drawing on their experience, intuition, or a visual comparison of
trends.

The synthetic control method, by contrast, was developed to provide a data-driven way
to choose a comparison group. In particular, in the context of a state-level intervention,
the methodology allows researchers to assign an analytic weight to each U.S. state that has
not implemented a given policy where the weights are computed such that the difference
in the trends on a given preintervention outcome, such as juvenile arrest rates between
treated states and the pool of available comparison states, is minimized. In this way, a
comparison group is generated that, conditional on pretreatment observables, experiences
parallel trends--at least prior to implementation of the treatment.
In the present application, the synthetic control method was used to determine empir-
ically the mixture of states that manifest a similar pre-2010 trend in juvenile arrests. This
approach avoids the need to hand-pick specific states that could serve as controls for theo-
retical reasons but might, in reality, be poor proxies for the counterfactual of Connecticut
without a raised age of majority as a result of different underlying criminal justice regimes
or other differences in juvenile justice policy. The synthetic control procedure works as
follows: Let the index j = (1,2,J) denote the J states in the United States that have not
recently raised the age of juvenile majority. The value j = 1 corresponds to Connecticut,
whereas j = (2,J) corresponds to each of the other U.S. states in the donor pool of states
that are potential comparison units for Connecticut. Define Y0 as a k × 1 vector with
elements equal to arrest rates in each year of the pretreatment period and likewise define
the k × J matrix Y1 as a stack of similar vectors for each of the other J states in the donor
pool. The application of the synthetic control method identifies a convex combination of
the J ­ 1 states in the donor pool that best approximates the preintervention data vectors
for Connecticut. That is, by using the applied algorithm, a weighted average of other U.S.
states is chosen that closely resembles Connecticut with respect to juvenile arrest rate, prior
to Connecticut's policy change in 2010. Define the J × 1 weighting vector W = (w1, w2,
wJ) such that:
(A1) J
i = 1
wj
= 1
(A2) wj  0 for j = (1, J )
Condition (A1) guarantees that the weights sum to 1, whereas condition (A2) con-
strains that the weights are weakly positive. The product Y1W then gives a weighted average
of the preintervention vectors for all states in the donor pool, with the difference between
Connecticut and this average given by Y0 ­ Y1W. Values for the weighting vector, W, are
then selected that result in a synthetic comparison group that best approximates the prein-
tervention crime trend in Connecticut. Once the optimal weighting vector W* is computed,
both the preintervention path as well as the postintervention values for the dependent vari-
able in "synthetic" Connecticut can be tabulated by calculating the corresponding weighted
average for each year using the donor states with positive weights. The postintervention
values for the synthetic control group composed of the weighted average of states mirroring

the preintervention trajectory of Connecticut serve as the counterfactual outcomes for what
would have happened in Connecticut if no change to the age of majority had occurred in
2010.
Our principal estimate of the impact of each of Connecticut's policy shocks on crime
and juvenile arrests uses the pre- and posttreatment values for both Connecticut and its
synthetic control group to calculate a simple differences-in-differences estimate. Specifically,
define YCT

period (2001­2009) and YCT

To test formally the significance of any observed relative change in the crime rate
of Connecticut cities, we apply a permutation test suggested by Abadie et al. (2010)
and implemented by Bohn, Lofstrom, and Raphael (2014) to the D-D estimator given in
Equation (1). Specifically, for each state in the donor pool, we recompute weights to generate
a placebo control group for that state. Next, we recompute the synthetic D-D estimates under
the assumption that each of these other states, in fact, raised their age of majority in 2010.
Because the causal effect of these placebo laws must be zero by construction, the distribution
of these "placebo" D-D estimates then provides the equivalent of a sampling distribution
for the estimate DDCT by comparing the observed difference between Connecticut and its
synthetic comparison with the distribution of differences within the states that did not raise
their ages of majority (see Abadie et al., 2010, for a detailed discussion).
To estimate this synthetic control model, we use monthly state-level Uniform Crime
Reports (UCR) panel data for the period 2001­2012.6 To ensure that the selected and
weighted control cases do not include states that experimented with different versions of
the "raise-the-age" legislation during this period, we exclude Colorado, Illinois, Missouri,
Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Rhode Island from the donor pool. We first implement this
method with the fraction of 15- to 17-year-old arrestees that are 16 years old. This metric
captures any change in the relative contribution of 16-year-old arrestees above and beyond
secular changes for other youthful offenders. To assess whether any changes in arrests are
observable in changes in the crime rate, we then reestimate the synthetic control estimates
by using overall state crime rates. As a result of the unavailability of offender age information

Connecticut's donor pool for each reported model. The computed weights for each reported model
suggest which U.S. states have pre-2010 trajectories that are most comparable with those of
Connecticut. The dissimilarity of weights by outcome reinforces the utility of synthetic controls as
compared with a static set of adjacent comparison states.

in the UCR-reported crime data, we cannot estimate age-specific offending rates. Instead,
we examine overall statewide crime rates, which juveniles disproportionately contribute to,
to see whether there is any evidence of corresponding shifts in the overall crime rate.
Figure 2a depicts the primary results of the synthetic control comparison showing
the fraction of all youthful arrestees (15­17-year-olds) that are 16 years of age leading
up to and after the 2010 law change. Three notable findings emerge from this graph.
First, an extraordinarily similar comparison group is identified when the synthetic control
method is applied that closely tracks the trajectory of Connecticut's arrest trends in the
pre-2010 period.7 Second, the trends for Connecticut and its synthetic comparison group
sharply diverge in 2010, which is consistent with the dip in 16-year-old arrests observed
in Figure 1. Finally, there is a convergence of trends beginning approximately 1 year after
the initial divergence. The magnitude of the arrest difference between Connecticut and
all other states in 2010 is 2.7 percentage points (representing a 14% reduction) and falls
to less than one percentage point by 2012. Figure 2b plots the counterfactual distribution
of treatment effects by studying the effect of a placebo intervention for each state in the
donor pool. When comparing the actual difference in arrests observed for Connecticut with
the placebo comparisons reported in Figure 2b, it appears as though the magnitude of the
estimated difference for Connecticut is initially larger than all but two placebo estimates,
suggesting that Connecticut's decline in arrests is unlikely to be spurious. Nevertheless, by
7. It is notable that the match between Connecticut and synthetic Connecticut is excellent, even when we
condition only on preperiod observations of the dependent variable and not on any other covariates.
This is a common feature of synthetic controls applications because by having matched on the lags of
the dependent variable, we are implicitly matching on other covariates as well, insofar as the
dependent variable is serially correlated. Given the quality of the match on the basis of lags of the
dependent variable alone, we choose not to condition on other covariates so as to minimize the
problem of overfitting (Abadie et al., 2010).

2012, the estimated difference for Connecticut is very close to zero and falls well within the
counterfactual sampling distribution.
Given the magnitude of the drop in 16-year-old arrests observed in 2010, it is possible
that a corresponding drop in nonage-specific crime rates should be visible if changes in
offender behavior are driving this observed drop in 16-year-old offenders. Figure 3 presents
a series of synthetic control models testing this hypothesis with statewide UCR-reported
crimes replacing youthful arrests as the dependent variable. A similarly high-quality prepe-
riod match is achieved by applying these new models, and at first glance, sizable divergences
are shown between Connecticut and its synthetic comparison for both violent (Figure 3a)
and property crime (Figure 3c) trends. Yet, these drops appear to be unremarkable as most
placebo estimates (Figure 3b and 3d) are of similar or larger magnitudes.8

offenses). We also use American Community Survey (ACS) data to determine whether there is any

Incident-Level, Age-Specific Offender, and Arrestee Comparison
To address the unavailability of age-specific offending rates at the state level, we use Na-
tional Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) incident-level data from participating
Connecticut law enforcement agencies (75 of 102 as of 2008) to determine whether any
changes in the age-specific arrests are mirrored by changes in age-specific offending behavior
or are better explained by changes in officer arrest or recording behavior (see Figure 4 for
a descriptive comparison). NIBRS data have been used previously to understand better
the connections among offenders, victims, and the resulting arrest events--connections
that were significantly more difficult to understand when only UCR data were available
(Akiyama and Nolan, 1999; Thompson, Saltzman, and Bibel, 1999). A comparison of
offender and arrestee age data has also been proposed and tested (Chilton and Jarvis, 1999),
but it has not been incorporated in the literature on the effects of criminal justice policies on
juvenile offending, which has primarily relied on either self-reported offending information
or official arrestee data.
Unlike these other forms of data on offenders, the NIBRS data series contains an
annual count of the ages of arrestees as well as estimated yearly ages of nonarrested offenders
for all Group A incidents, corresponding to Part I crimes in the UCR program. Nonarrest
offender ages in the NIBRS data are derived from incident reports taken by police officers
responding to Group A incidents. As self-reported ages are not available, as they are for
incidents leading to an arrest, suspect ages are generated from victim, officer, or other witness
statements. These age estimates are therefore subject to witness error, but the findings of
past record check studies where both self-reported and victim-reported age estimates are
evidence that birth cohort effects explain changes in age-specific crime and arrest patterns, a
proposition that has no support in the data.
Volume 16 r Issue 1 59
Research Article Raising the Age of Majority
available have showed a high degree of correspondence (Hindelang, Hirschi, and Weis,
1981). More importantly for the present application, as long as the errors in witness age
estimation are smooth across the age threshold of the policy shock, systematic errors in
witness age identification will not compromise our ability to draw inferences from the data.
More specifically, as there is no a priori reason to believe that victims or witnesses should
change their reporting of an offender's age to the police as a function of the policy shock,
an abrupt change in the ages of offenders as identified by victims and witnesses constitutes
evidence in favor of a change in age-specific offending. When using these data, changes in
age-specific police arrest behavior can be separated from age-specific changes in offender
behavior. If age-specific arrest rates and age-specific offending rates change equally after the
implementation of an age-specific policy, then these changes likely reflect offender behavior
without evidence of officer filtering behavior. If age-specific arrest rates and age-specific
offending rates change unequally after the implementation of an age-specific policy, then
some combination of officer and offender behavioral change is likely present. The full set
of possible interpretations of this inequality will be explored later in this article.
To estimate the effect of the 2010 law change for 16-year-olds on crime, we fit a
least-squares regression model by using monthly NIBRS Group A data for all Connecticut
agencies that participated in the NIBRS program from 2008 through 2011. The model is
estimated separately for age-specific incidents/offenses and age-specific arrests. The models
are based on the following basic equation:
ln(Yat ) = 0
+ 1Time + 2T2010
+ 3Age16
+ 1T2010
× Age16
+ at (2)
In Equation (2), ln(Yat ) is the logged number of arrests or offenses in month t for
age group a. Time is a vector of the count of months from 1 to 48, and accordingly
1 accounts for statewide time trends in arrests for either of the two omitted age groups
(15 or 17). T2010 is a dummy variable indicating whether the month falls during or after
January 2010, and 2 accounts for any differences in pre- and post-2010 trend intercepts
while maintaining a common slopes assumption. The coefficient 3 captures the difference
between the logged number of arrests or offenses for the 16-year-olds affected by the law
change and the omitted comparison ages (15 or 17). Finally, 1 provides an estimate of
the treatment effect of the law change for the 16-year-olds after the 2010 law change.
For simplicity, in Equation (2), time is modeled as a linear process; in practice, we also
estimated the model more flexibly allowing time to vary according to a quadratic, cubic,
and quartic time trend with similar results. For the estimation of these models, data are
limited to the years 2008 through 2011 for agencies participating for the full period. The
regression described in Equation (2) is estimated four different times. In the first estimation,
we compare incidents involving 16-year-old offenders with incidents involving 15-year-old
offenders to see whether their trajectories diverge after the law change. We next reestimate
this equation substituting incidents involving 17-year-old offenders for the 15-year-old
comparison group. To estimate the effect of the law change on age-specific arrest rates, we

then substitute NIBRS juvenile arrest data covering the same period of time for the offender
data used in the first two comparisons. Equation (2) is then reestimated comparing 16-year-
old arrestees with 15-year-old arrestees and, finally, 16-year-old arrestees with 17-year-old
arrestees.
Table 1 reports regression-based estimates of the effect of raising the age of criminal
majority when using Connecticut NIRBS data. These models are estimated with the basic
functional form represented in Equation (2). Estimates are presented for the 16-year-old
policy change by using NIRBS incident as well as arrest data. When referring to the Age 15
model, which compares 16-year-old with 15-year-old offenders, we observe a near-zero and
insignificant effect of the law change on incidents using the D-D model (Column 1). When
comparing 16-year-olds with 17-year-olds (Column 2), the coefficient on the interaction,
which estimates the D-D model, is slightly larger but still small and insignificant. Although
the number of incidents involving 16-year-old offenders is lower in 2010 than it was in
2009, the change was not significantly different than the changes observed for incidents
involving 15-year-olds or 17-year-olds.
Next, we turn to the models that are used to estimate the effect of the law change
on the number of juvenile arrests. These models are presented in columns 3 and 4 of
Table 1. Overall, the pattern of the coefficients is similar to those presented in columns 1
and 2. Fifteen-year-olds have a significantly lower number of arrests in 2008 than do 16-year-
olds who have a similarly lower number of arrests than do 17-year-olds. Implementation
of the law change in 2010 does little to affect either age group, and coefficients for the

interaction are in the mid-single digits and insignificant. As the estimates are similar to and
not statistically distinguishable from those we obtained for offending, there is little evidence
that patterns in the estimated treatment effects are driven by changes in police behavior.
Nevertheless, the large p values in each set of tests preclude us from formally testing to see
whether each set of coefficients is different from one another.
Given the many law enforcement agencies (LEAs) that are tasked with implementing
the new age of majority created by the 2010 law change, we also examine the arrest patterns
for the top ten law enforcement reporting agencies in the state of Connecticut (see Figure 5).
These included Bridgeport, East Hartford, Hartford, Manchester, Meriden, New Britain,
New Haven, Norwalk, Stamford, and Waterbury. Doing so enables us to assess the degree
to which overall state estimates are uniformly generated by the major police agencies in
the state or whether these state estimates mask heterogeneity in the response of juveniles
and/or police officers to these changes to the legal age of majority. For seven of the ten
largest agencies, the trends for each age group are similar and reveal little indication of a
discontinuity for 16-year-old arrestees in 2010. New Haven provides the clearest evidence
of a discontinuity for 16-year-olds in 2010, but this change is also paralleled by a drop for
15-year-olds in the same year. Notably, Hartford and East Hartford each manifest unusual
patterns of arrests in 2010. In the case of East Hartford, there is a noticeable drop in arrests
62 Criminology & Public Policy
Loeffler and Chalfin
for 16-year-olds in 2010, which is followed by a recovery in this trend in 2011. At the
same time, the number of arrests for 15-year-olds correspondingly jumps and then returns
to level--suggesting that some form of substitution process could be at work. The trends
for Hartford are even starker. Hartford's 16-year-old arrest trends manifest an immediate
reduction in all but the most serious youthful arrests (for violence) in the period after the
2010 law change--a drop-off that does not recover until 2012. This reduction, with its
sharp and age-specific discontinuous drop in arrests followed by a full recovery to preexisting
trends pattern 2 years later, is much more consistent with a change in police arrest behavior
than is a change in juvenile offending.9 There is little reason to think that two successive
cohorts of 16-year-olds stopped committing nearly all arrestable offenses within the city of
Hartford. But there is plenty of reason to believe, based on contemporaneous reporting,
that police officers might temporarily react to uncertainty of the new and still changing legal
landscape by not making arrests of 16-year-olds involved in nonviolent offenses (Backus,
2011). Although our main results at the state level, as reported in Figures 2 and 3 and
Table 1, are robust to the inclusion or exclusion of these cities, this agency-level variability
indicates that not all jurisdictions had the same experience and that it will be much more
difficult to estimate the impact of raise the age for these jurisdictions.
Discussion
The results from recent research have shown that juveniles, including juvenile offenders,
continue to mature well into their 20s. These findings, when coupled with related research
showing the adverse effects of prosecuting certain juvenile offenders as adults, have given
rise to a multistate policy initiative to raise the legal age of majority in states with a sub-18
age of majority. To date, several states have already enacted such changes, and legislatures
in several more are actively considering doing so. Despite this considerable research and
policy-making agenda, the effects of these policy enactments to determine whether, as
proponents of these policies have postulated, youthful crime will be diminished, or as
critics have feared, it will be exacerbated, have only been systematically evaluated in one
previous study (Loeffler and Grunwald, 2015a). Despite this limited available evidence,
some commentators have reasoned that policy changes were effective given continuing and
possibly accelerating decline in juvenile arrests, particularly 16-year-olds after Connecticut's
modified age of majority went into effect in 2010 (Justice Policy Institute, 2013).
To assess this possibility, the present study examined how these observed changes
in arrests for affected juveniles co-varied with national trends and age-specific juvenile
offending rates within Connecticut. By using these two complementary approaches, we
9. Although it is possible that this result might help explain why the drop in juvenile arrests for
Connecticut as a whole observed in the synthetic control models was not mirrored in the micro-level
analysis, the exclusion of Hartford from the synthetic control models did not significantly change the
results of these models.
Volume 16 r Issue 1 63
Research Article Raising the Age of Majority
observe that Connecticut experienced a sizable but temporary drop in their arrests of
16-year-olds compared with other states, which was not mirrored by a change in the overall
reported crimes for Connecticut versus other states. When looking more closely at these
patterns, we observed that whereas the drop in juvenile arrests for 16-year-olds is larger than
expected based on the preexisting arrest trends for youthful offenders, when age-specific
offending rates are available, it does not appear that these trends are present, at least to the
same degree. Finally, after exploring the heterogeneity across agencies within Connecticut,
we observed that although many agencies have age-specific arrest trends that show a steady
decline beginning in 2008, 2 years before the law change went into effect, at least one large
agency has trends that sharply diverge after the 2010 law change only to converge again
circa 2012. This temporary drop was observed in a non-NIBRS reporting agency, which
could explain why this pattern was also observed in statewide synthetic control estimates but
not in the age-specific offender/arrest tests that rely on NIBRS information. These results
support several conclusions.
First, these results add to growing evidence that statutory boundaries between the
juvenile and adult justice systems as well as changes to these boundaries have few observable
effects on offender behavior (Hjalmarsson, 2009; Jensen and Metsger, 1994; Lee and
McCrary, 2009; Risler et al., 1998; Singer and McDowall, 1988). This may be because
of the absence of meaningful treatment differences or, consistent with other research on
juvenile decision making, the insensitivity of juveniles to these incentives.
Second, these results suggest that for scholars studying the effects on criminal behavior,
it is essential to look closely at the possible effects on official behavior--who gets arrested
and, as findings from other research have shown, what they get arrested for. This article
provides some of the first empirical evidence that what may seem like changes in offending
behavior can result from changes in officer arrest behavior. As a result of the absence of age-
specific offending rates in many large municipalities, because of incomplete participation
in the NIBRS program, the effects of age-specific policy changes will likely be difficult to
disentangle. Nevertheless, when information on arrestees and offenders is available, both
measures should be examined.
Third, the measurement of implementation fidelity is a key component of criminal
justice evaluation. Given the observed heterogeneity in arrest trends by agency, reflecting
the implementation challenges noted contemporaneously with the policy change in 2010,
it is clear that at least some agencies took an alternative approach to implementing the
change in the age of majority. This type of subjurisdictional variation in implementation
did not alter statewide results. Yet, in other evaluations of criminal justice policy, results
may be more highly sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of contributing jurisdictions with
unexpected implementation patterns.
For the policy discussion in Connecticut, these results suggest that there is no discern-
able effect of raising the age on crime or juvenile crime. Although there is some evidence of
changes in the number of arrests by age, the change in the age of majority was not the primary
64 Criminology & Public Policy
Loeffler and Chalfin
driver of declining juvenile crime rates, nor did the change halt these preexisting declines,
as was initially feared. As such, the policy may have contributed to additional processing
costs without providing all of the anticipated cost-savings in the form of reduced recidivism.
Beyond Connecticut, these results also suggest that public safety may not be the primary
lens through which this policy initiative should be viewed (Brown, 2012; NCRSJJS, 2013;
Rubin, 2012). Even though this study is the first such study to include an examination of
"raise the age" at the aggregate level and, therefore, to show no impact on the overall crime
equation, it is the second study to show no impact on a measure of criminal offending
(Loeffler and Grunwald, 2015a). Future research on "raise-the-age" and other related policy
initiatives (e.g., juvenile decarceration) could usefully be focused on the nonpublic-safety
effects of these policies. For example, little is known about the effects of shifting the age
of majority on schooling or labor market outcomes, although Aizer and Doyle (2013)
have suggested that changes in juvenile justice processing or punishments could generate
substantial increases in human capital among affected juveniles. This reaction could occur
despite the fact that many features of the juvenile justice system that are most obviously
different than the adult juvenile system, such as routine access to educational opportunities
and limited dissemination of criminal history record information, are more directly tied to
these untested life-course outcomes rather than to the more commonly studied metrics of
crime and criminal recidivism.
A final possible consequence of this finding is that the current policy focus on simply
shifting juveniles between parallel justice systems may not be as impactful on juvenile crime
as either proponents hoped or critics feared (Farrington et al., 2012). If this possibility
is borne out, policy makers might consider an alternative strategy focused on identifying
specific elements of the juvenile justice system that have been shown to lower crime and
then pilot importation of these policies into the adult system or vice versa. The results from
recent research, for example, have found promising evidence that providing at-risk youth
with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can have profound effects on future criminality
(Heller, Pollack, Ander, and Ludwig, 2013). This focus on identifying specific practices that
are beneficial to juveniles and making them available to juveniles regardless of the specific
judicial system in which they are prosecuted reconciles the need to ensure juveniles receive
adequate services with the emerging evidence that the distinction between juvenile and
adult justice systems may be less meaningful than previously thought. Such an emphasis
on implementing age-specific policies irrespective of jurisdictional considerations echoes
elements of past policy proposals to abolish the juvenile justice system altogether in favor
of a system with age-appropriate policies and legal safeguards (Feld, 1997).
Despite whether these alternative policies are adopted, we will soon have even more
evidence of the effectiveness of the current "raise-the-age" policies. Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, and Illinois all raised their respective ages of majority to 18 in whole or in part
in 2014. New York is currently considering doing so as well. And Connecticut, Illinois,
and Vermont seem to be contemplating raising the age of legal majority from 18 to 21.

Research Article Raising the Age of Majority
This change is so large that existing estimates are of limited value in predicting their
possible consequences. As studies of these recently or soon-to-be-enacted law changes are
undertaken, similar or disparate results may be found. The policy differential between
the juvenile and adult justice systems in each of these jurisdictions may not be perfectly
substitutable. Similarly, differences in the juvenile offending population could generate
different results. Even if the results reported here do not hold for other jurisdictions, careful
attention to measurement issues is warranted and the methods demonstrated in this article
can be used to resolve many of the most common estimation challenges encountered in the
evaluation of single-jurisdiction, age-specific policies.
