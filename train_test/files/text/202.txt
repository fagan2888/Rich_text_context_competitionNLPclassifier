Demographic Issues In
Medicare Reform
Birthrates, death rates, and an aging population all affect
Medicare's financing.
by David McKusick
ABSTRACT: This paper estimates the contribution of demographics to the
Medicare financing dilemma. It suggests that delayed eligibility, by itself, cannot
solve this problem. Although there is uncertainty regarding each component of
demographic change, there is little hope that the future population distribution
will save the program without other, more painful, measures. Methods used in
the private sector, such as prefunding, have not been seriously applied to
medical insurance but might provide part of the solution for long-run solvency.
Medicare reformers confront many serious prob-
lems. One of the most worrisome is the role of demograph-
ics as the population ages. Population changes alone will
double Medicare's financial burden relative to earnings in the next
seventy-five years. The aging population eventually will include
many more beneficiaries and few workers to provide tax income to
pay for their benefits. The situation is somewhat worse in the
United States than in other industrialized countries because the
post­World War II baby boom was more pronounced here. Persons
born in 1946 will reach age sixty-five in the year 2011, the year that
population aging truly begins to pick up speed.
Placed in perspective, the projected future influence of popula-
tion change on Medicare program costs over the next seventy-five
years is much less than the influence of price inflation has been over
the past thirty years. Nevertheless, population change will com-
pound the other problems.
Although many analysts view population forecasts as reliable,
considerable uncertainty exists about each component of popula-
tion change: fertility, migration, and mortality. The respected de-
mographer Nathan Keyfitz, after reviewing more than 1,000 popula-
tion forecasts for a variety of countries, concluded that "relatively

short-term forecasts, say up to ten or 20 years, do tell us something,
but . . . beyond a quarter-century or so we simply do not know what
the population will be."1 Despite this, I believe that the lack of preci-
sion in long-run forecasts is no reason to flinch from looking into the
future. A long-run forecast such as those prepared for the Medicare
trustees is a necessary part of ongoing vigilance, even though it is
recognized that the forecast must be revised as experience emerges.2
Despite the uncertainty, the demographic problem alone clearly will
require major changes in Medicare.
Medicare And Demographics: The Basics
For funding purposes, the Medicare program is divided into Hospi-
tal Insurance (HI, or Part A) and Supplementary Medical Insurance
(SMI, or Part B). The former pays for inpatient hospital care, short-
term skilled nursing facility (SNF) services, acute home health care
services, and limited hospice care. The latter pays for physician
services including lab and x-ray, outpatient hospital care, ambula-
tory surgical centers, some home health care, and other miscellane-
ous services such as ambulance and durable medical equipment.
Two major differences distinguish the two programs from the
perspective of long-run financial soundness. HI is supported almost
entirely from a payroll tax, which is paid into a trust fund, and
benefits are disbursed from that trust fund. The fund is small rela-
tive to program commitments and serves primarily to allow tax
collections and program payments to be made without explicit an-
nual appropriations of funds. This tax structure is established in law
into perpetuity. Each year the board of trustees of the HI program
presents a forecast of the financial status of the fund, projected for
seventy-five years into the future.3
SMI is paid for by premiums charged to enrollees and payments
from general tax revenue matching premiums at a ratio specified by
law at roughly a three-to-one ratio. Premiums are promulgated by
the secretary of health and human services (HHS) annually, so it is
possible to measure the financial future of the trust fund for only one
year at a time. This odd financial arrangement insulates the Part B
trust fund from the publicity that accompanies the periodic crises
suffered by the Part A trust fund when it is announced to be at the
brink of bankruptcy. The financial strain on the taxpayers, however,
is not ameliorated by this short-run financing strategy. The services
covered by Part A (coincidentally, it appears) are more influenced by
the average age of enrollees than are the services covered by Part B.
That is, hospital, SNF, and home health costs rise more rapidly with
age than do physician and outpatient costs, which dominate Part B.
The basic demographic problem facing Medicare is that Medicare

enrollment, currently a little under 15 percent of the population, is
projected to increase to 20 percent of the population by 2025 and 25
percent by 2073. At about the same time, the population ages twenty
to sixty-four, which has traditionally made up the tax-paying work-
force, is expected to decline from about 59 percent of the population
to 55 percent during that time. The ratio of the population age
sixty-five and older to the population ages twenty to sixty-four,
sometimes called the elderly dependency ratio, is now about 20
percent and will grow to 30 percent by 2023 and 40 percent by 2073,
under intermediate demographic assumptions.
Until recently, it was difficult to treat the demographics of the
Medicare program very seriously because exploding program pay-
ments, due mostly to increases in the price of services, dominated
the growth rate. In the 1970s Medicare outlays increased fivefold
(with a little boost from adding the disabled to Medicare rolls). In
the 1980s expenditures tripled.4 Under current projections, spend-
ing will more than double during the 1990s. Even the unprecedented
enrollment growth expected between 2015 and 2025 will cause pro-
gram enrollment to increase by only two-thirds.
In the past several years, however, Medicare cost increases result-
ing from nondemographic factors have moderated so that they grew
only 2­3 percent faster than wage increases in covered employ-
ment.5 Part of this is attributable to better control of unit costs
following the introduction of the prospective payment system (PPS)
for hospitals and limits on physician fees using volume performance
standards. The volume of hospital and physician services also has
grown more slowly, perhaps because of the specific actions of Con-
gress or perhaps because of changes taking place in the broader
health care market. With this slower growth in the price and vol-
ume of services per enrollee, the prospects for finding an acceptable
solution to the long-range financing problems are enhanced, and the
demographic component assumes a more significant role.
If the populations of beneficiaries and workers were to grow at
the same rate, volume and price of services per beneficiary could
grow at the same rate as wages per worker in covered employment
without requiring continuing tax increases. Between 1994 and 1997
wages in covered employment grew at an average annual rate of 4
percent, while Medicare costs per capita grew at an average annual
rate of 6 percent. This compares with an average annual increase in
wages of 7 percent per worker in the 1970s, when Medicare costs per
enrollee grew 14 percent annually. Between 2010 and 2025 the
working-age population is assumed to grow 0.5 percent annually,
while the population age sixty-five and older is projected to grow 3
percent. This excess growth of 2.5 percentage points would have to

be compensated for by reducing Medicare per capita costs to 2.5
percentage points below the projected wage growth of 4.5 percent
per year, if taxes are not to rise.6 A simplified way to isolate the
demographic element of Medicare costs is to fix rates of utilization
per capita and prices per unit of service and then calculate how
changes in the age/sex mix of the population influence the cost.
Similarly, we also can isolate the effects of demographic changes on
earnings.7 Exhibit 1 presents projected Medicare costs and popula-
tion earnings under such assumptions (allowing demographic fac-
tors to vary while holding other relevant factors constant) using
three sets of demographic projections: low cost, intermediate cost,
and high cost. Since we are primarily interested in percentage
changes between years, the Medicare cost per capita and earnings
figures are shown in Exhibit 1 relative to the baseline year, 1998.
Under the intermediate set of demographic assumptions, the av-
erage Medicare cost per person rises 35 percent between 1998 and
2023, 68 percent between 1998 and 2048, and 83 percent between
1998 and 2073. It is possible, of course, that the demographic compo-
sition also could have a positive effect on average earnings if the
population became more concentrated in high-earnings age groups,
thus helping to offset increased expenses. However, as the exhibit
also shows, the isolated effects of demographic changes on earnings
are negative, thus compounding the problem.

eligibility age from sixty-five to seventy years, for years after 1998 all

Medicare costs in the sixty-five to sixty-nine age group have been
omitted, and the labor-force participation rate at ages sixty-five to
sixty-nine is assumed to double. Medicare expenses drop about 15
percent, and earnings rise about 3 percent. The demographic lever-
age of delaying Medicare eligibility is not large enough by itself to
erase the deterioration in program solvency even if it is accompanied
by increased workforce participation among the elderly.
Determinants Of Population Distribution
There are three determinants of population distribution by age and
sex: mortality, fertility, and net migration. Of these, mortality is
most likely to influence Medicare's financial viability over the next
twenty-five years. Most of the population that will be eligible for
benefits in that period are living now, although a few young persons
could become eligible because of disability or end-stage renal dis-
ease. Net (legal) migration has been small in recent decades, and
there is no reason to anticipate major changes in the near future.
Mortality determines how many survive to eligibility and the lon-
gevity of those who do. For the second and third twenty-five-year
periods of the forecast, mortality continues to play a major role, but
fertility and migration have a potentially significant effect on the
size and age distribution of the labor force.
n Mortality. Compared with other components of change in
Medicare costs and income, mortality has shown remarkable pre-
dictability over the past several decades; however, even this element
could vary enough to produce significantly different program out-
comes. Overall mortality in the U.S. population has declined a little
over 1 percent annually during the twentieth century. However, the
decline has been erratic and even reversed during certain periods.
During 1940­1990 age-adjusted death rates declined about 1.4 per-
cent annually.8 During the 1940s age-adjusted mortality rates de-
clined more than 2 percent annually, but during the 1960s improve-
ment was only a little more than 0.5 percent annually. Age-adjusted
mortality increased among men in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and
mortality among women has recently increased.
Both the levels of mortality and improvement rates vary signifi-
cantly among population subgroups. The differentials suggest to
some the possibility of improved mortality and longevity if the mor-
tality rates of groups with poor experience can be brought into line
with those of the best groups. Women have lower age-adjusted
mortality rates than men and have benefited more from mortality
improvements over the past century. That mortality differential
seems to persist at all ages. Some believe that the differential is
innate, but others have conjectured that differences in lifestyle (es-

pecially smoking and stress) are the causes.9 The differences in
death rates are substantial (for example, age-adjusted central death
rates for men were 50 percent higher than for women in 1995 overall
and three times higher than for women in their late teens and early
twenties), which results in added life expectancy for women of
about six years at birth and three years at age sixty-five.
There also are substantial differences in mortality among races.
Age-adjusted black mortality is about 75 percent higher than white
mortality (although the overall difference is relatively small, because
of the different age distribution of the races). On the other hand,
Asian Americans have age-adjusted mortality that is about 25 per-
cent lower than that of whites. The differential between blacks and
whites has decreased over the past fifty years. This apparent re-
sponse to public funding of health care for the elderly or poor has
suggested to some that the differences in death rates by race are not
innate but primarily attributable to socioeconomic conditions.10
Cross-national mortality comparisons also have been used in esti-
mating the best mortality rates achievable by large populations,
given current lifestyle practices. Japan now has the highest reported
life expectancy in the world and has shown dramatic improvement
during the past few decades. In 1960 Japan's life expectancy was just
over sixty-five years. U.S. life expectancy was almost sixty-seven
years, and Sweden led among industrialized countries at a little over
seventy-one years. By 1982 Japan's life expectancy exceeded sev-
enty-four years, the United States was a little over seventy-one, and
the former leader Sweden had risen to a little over seventy-three
years. Life expectancy in Japan now exceeds eighty-one years, while
U.S. life expectancy is about seventy-six years.11
How much difference do variations in mortality projections mat-
ter for the size of the Medicare enrollment in the future? In response
to Census Bureau projections for a range of mortality improvements
that they consider too timid, Dennis Ahlburg and James Vaupel
prepared population projections for 1990 through 2080.12 Their
baseline fixes the total fertility rate at 1.84 (approximately the rate
in the mid-1980s), net immigration at 500,000 annually, and no
improvements in mortality from the 1990 level. Under this scenario
the U.S. population increases from 250 million in 1990 to 286 million
in 2020 and then declines to 280 million in 2050 and 265 million in
2080, as low birthrates overcome the initial influence of the baby
boom of the 1950s. Holding all other assumptions fixed, these ana-
lysts project a population that grows to 294 million in 2020 and 307
million in both 2050 and 2080 if mortality is assumed to decline 1
percent annually. If mortality were to decline 2 percent annually
(high by standards of the past century), the population would reach

302 million in 2020, 333 million in 2050, and 349 million in 280. Of
particular interest here, if mortality decreases 2 percent annually,
the proportion of the population over age sixty-five rises from 12
percent in 1990 to 30 percent in 2050, compared with Census Bu-
reau estimates of the time of 21­23 percent and current Social Secu-
rity Administration (SSA) estimates of 17­25 percent. The popula-
tion over age eighty-five increases from 1.3 percent of the population
in 1990 to 11 percent by 2050, based on their fixed fertility and
migration schedules. The SSA's low mortality forecast projects
about 7.5 percent of the population over age eighty-five in 2073.
Clearly, some experts do not believe that the SSA's mortality fore-
casts make adequate allowance for improvements in mortality,
which would create even greater problems than anticipated for all of
the social insurance programs. However, the future demographic
scenarios being described by the SSA are the product of assump-
tions about several components of demographic change. It is the
balance of these assumptions that determines whether the range of
reasonable possibilities has been described.
n Fertility.The fertility part of Medicare's emerging demographic
problem arises from the prolonged baby boom following World
War II followed by a sharp reduction in birthrates. In the longer
term, over the next seventy-five years, the projected continuation of
low birthrates compared with improved survival to old age would
worsen the financial status of Medicare as now constituted. This is
the mirror image of the demographic bonus of the early decades of
Social Security, when births were high relative to longevity and
provided a labor force that grew relative to the number of retirees.
To place the fertility issue in some perspective, consider the U.S.
total fertility rate during the past century. This rate is a summary
measure of birthrates fora given year andrepresents the total number
of children a hypothetical woman would have if she were to survive
her childbearing years and experience the birthrates of that year at
each age.13 A total fertility rate of 2.1 is considered replacement fertil-
ity, allowing for male babies outnumbering females and childhood
mortality before those children reached childbearing years.14 The ac-
tual number of births in the year depends on age-specific birthrates
and the age distribution of women in the population.
The total fertility rate in 1920 was about 3.3 births per woman and
declined to 2.7 in 1928. The rate further declined to 2.2 by 1933 and
remained there until 1940. The resulting small cohort of this period
produced slow growth in the Medicare population sixty-five years
later, starting in 1998 and expected to continue through 2005. The
total fertility rate grew steadily through the years of World War II
to about 2.4, jumped to about 3.0 immediately after the war, and

reached a peak of 3.6 in the late 1950s. The impact of this baby boom
on the labor force appeared about 1965; its influence on Medicare
eligibility will show up shortly after 2010.
The total fertility rate declined steadily from 1959 to a low of
between 1.7 and 1.8 in 1976, where it continued for about a decade. A
modest recovery to about 2.0 remains today. This relatively small
cohort began entering the workforce a few years ago. These persons
would become eligible for Medicare as aged beneficiaries about
2040, but currently projected low birthrates do not provide corre-
sponding income relief from the labor force.
The experience of other developed countries provides some per-
spective on the future of U.S. fertility. Among English-speaking
countries the evolution of the baby boom and bust was closely
synchronized, and all now have total fertility rates below the re-
placement rate.15 Most European countries followed similar patterns
as the United States with similar timing, although the U.S. peak
fertility was the highest. Many now have total fertility rates below
the U.S. rate.16 Fertility rates have continued to decline in most
European countries, and only the United States and Sweden have
rebounded to near the replacement level.
Several theories of fertility have been proposed to explain this
history and perhaps predict the future. Economic theories have tried
to reconcile the seeming inconsistencies between fertility rates and
economic factors. Generally, low-income families and low-income
countries have higher birthrates than do those with high incomes.
Economic growth generally has been associated with lower fertility
rates. On the other hand, birthrates generally have moved in the
same direction as the economy during business cycles.
One resolution for industrialized societies, in which children are
generally not income producers for the family, is the proposition
that children become more expensive as income rises both because
the expectations for their education and acculturation rise and be-
cause the cost of parental time (especially the mother's) increases.17
From this perspective, one would probably expect continued low
fertility. The relatively small cohort now entering the workforce is
unlikely to produce any excess labor, and social changes that took
place over the past few decades appear to predict continuing de-
mand for women in the workplace.
An alternative scenario proposes that fertility is a function of
relative income of young men compared with that of their parents'
cohort.18 When young men's earnings are high compared with their
parents', they feel well off and have more children. Diane
Macunovich has attributed part of the recovery of birthrates to near
the replacement level in the early 1990s to this phenomenon plus

stagnation of women's wages at given educational levels.19
A noneconomic approach places the root of fertility decisions on
societal norms, which presumably impress social needs on the deci-
sions of individual couples. It has been suggested that the rapid
decline in birthrates in the 1960s was associated with environ-
mental concerns and that future fertility may respond to society's
needs to maintain itself.20
How does all of this relate to Medicare? The trustees' population
forecast conveys an expectation of continued low fertility, perhaps
reflecting the continuing very low rates in other industrialized
countries. The intermediate forecast of the 1998 trustees' reports is
based on an ultimate total fertility rate of 1.9 (reached by 2025). The
high and low total fertility rates (corresponding to low and high
cost) are 2.2 and 1.6, respectively. That is, the estimates of fertility
considered by the trustees range from just above the replacement
rate to well below it, resulting in an expectation of a small work-
force compared with the number of eligible Medicare beneficiaries.
Health Status, Retirement, And Medicare
There has been great interest in whether the declines in mortality
might also be accompanied by or even caused by improved health
status. A contrary hypothesis is that mortality improvement has
occurred among persons who are impaired and might have been
expected to die if they had not received the medical or other inter-
ventions that led to the decline in deaths.21
The current and future health status of the elderly population
could have a strong influence on Medicare program revenue and
outlays. In addition to the contribution that health makes to the
welfare of an individual, better population health could improve
Medicare's financial status by keeping taxpayers in the workforce
longer and by decreasing beneficiaries' demand for services.
Using the National Long-Term Care Surveys, Kenneth Manton
and colleagues found declines in both disability and morbidity in
the noninstitutionalized Medicare population between 1982 and
1989.22 The prevalence of arthritis declined by 1.7 percent annually,
arteriosclerosis by 5.0 percent, hypertension by 2.2 percent, and
circulatory problems by 3.8 percent. The proportion of the popula-
tion that was disabled--defined as (1) being institutionalized, (2)
failing an activity of daily living (ADL), or (3) failing an instrumental
activity of daily living (IADL) function--fell from 24.5 percent in
1982 to 22.6 percent in 1989.
Eileen Crimmins and colleagues also found declining disability
among the elderly in the Longitudinal Survey on Aging and National
Health Interview Survey between 1982 and 1993 but caution that

there is fluctuation in improvement and even worsening in some
years, which suggests that a clear trend is not evident.23 Elsewhere,
Crimmins recounts findings of increased levels of disability among
the elderly during the 1970s and suggests that the earlier results may
have occurred because death was delayed among disabled persons
but that the more promising trends of the 1980s might represent
actual improvements in health status.24 This study found declines
between 1982 and 1993 in the proportion of men and women ages
sixty to sixty-nine who reported inability to work. A decline of 0.71
percent annually was reported for men ages sixty-five and sixty-six
who said that they were unable to work and 0.55 percent for men
ages sixty-seven to sixty-nine. Among women in these age groups,
the annual declines were 0.53 percent and 0.71 percent.
Could this pool of retirees contribute to Medicare's financial sal-
vation? Michael Hurd reports that in 1988­1989 more than 80 per-
cent of men and 50 percent of women were in the labor force at age
fifty-five.25 By age sixty-five the rates had dropped to about 30 per-
cent of men and 20 percent of women. By age sixty-nine 20 percent
of men and 10 percent of women were still in the labor force. I have
updated those figures using the March 1997 Current Population
Survey (CPS) (Exhibit 2). About 85 percent of men and 70 percent
of women age fifty-five said that they were in the workforce during
1996. At age sixty-five there is a sharp drop in the proportion of men
and women in the workforce (40 percent of men and 30 percent of
women), and the proportion continues to decline.
Some workers already are only marginally participating in Medi-
care because they are probably in good health with modest medical
expenses and because many have chosen their employer-sponsored
insurance as their primary coverage instead of Medicare. Other
workers are in jobs without medical insurance but might be able to
purchase individual coverage if insurance laws allowed. Nonwork-
ers constitute a potentially large pool of persons who might be
working if their health permitted and if other considerations en-
couraged work or acquisition of private health insurance; this
policy-relevant finding deserves further attention.
The decision to retire obviously is not just a matter of health
status. Between 1960 and 1990 life expectancy at age sixty-five in-
creased more than 18 percent, while labor-force participation over
age sixty-five plummeted. David Wise credits pensions and Social
Security as the major contributors to the decision to retire.26 He
concludes that given the presence of a (defined-benefit) pension
plan, persons in excellent or very good health are more likely to plan
to work past age sixty-two, but in the absence of such a plan, health
status makes little difference. Availability of retiree health insur-

ance, Wise concludes, hastens retirement for those in excellent or
very good health but has very little influence on those in fair or poor
health. With or without retiree medical coverage, the existence of a
defined-benefit pension plan dominates the decision to retire early.
Does Medicare coverage encourage the sharp drop in employment
at age sixty-five? Several studies have reported that the existence of
employer-sponsored health insurance for retirees is an incentive to
retire prior to Medicare eligibility, but others have failed to find this
effect.27 Robin Lumsdaine and colleagues report that those with re-
tiree medical coverage, who presumably have no stronger incentive
to postpone retirement to age sixty-five than do those without, are
actually more likely to retire at exactly age sixty-five.28
On balance, it would seem unlikely that improved health status
will provide major relief to Medicare's financial problems. The evi-
dence of a sustained trend toward improvement is lacking. There is
ample evidence that much of the older population wants to retire as
soon as it is economically feasible.

Policy Implications
The demographic inconvenience facing Medicare in the next several
decades might be solved through the serendipity of a rebound in
fertility rates, a failure of mortality to improve, substantial improve-
ment in health status of the elderly, or even a carefully orchestrated
immigration policy. None of these seems particularly likely. The
commonly prescribed fix of delaying retirement rates appears to
offer at best minor relief. The population ages sixty-five to sixty-
nine makes up about a quarter of Medicare enrollment; because
these persons are younger than average (and thus incur lower costs),
removing them from the program would bring savings of less than 15
percent of program costs. Encouraging older persons to continue
working also does not help very much. Even if labor-force participa-
tion rates at ages sixty-five to sixty-nine were to double, Medicare
program income would increase less than 5 percent.
Few good examples exist in the private sector on which to model
Medicare financial reform. Prefunding (that is, accumulating assets
during one's active years for later use) is the traditional method for
assuring fixed-dollar commitments such as death benefits and an-
nuities. State laws, in fact, require prefunding for these private in-
surance products. But the Medicare trust funds retain no assets on
behalf of those who have paid taxes to support the present cohort of
beneficiaries. They serve only as temporary contingency reserves.
Some individual medical insurance plans prefund for the ex-
pected rise in cost due to aging, but this has always been a trivial
part of the inflation risk, which has been deemed intractable. With
medical costs increasing less rapidly in recent years, the inflation
risk starts to look more manageable, and the prospect of lessening
the demographic risk may be worth a second look.
Various forms of prefunding also are now under consideration for
the Social Security cash benefit programs. The most publicized of
the Social Security prefunding proposals would have the individual
contributor retain rights to the funds, but this is not a necessary part
of the concept. To deal with the demographic risk, the age cohort of
contributors would retain "rights" to the assets. Nor is it necessary
to prefund for the entire risk. In the cited case of individual medical
insurance, the policyholder group pays additional premiums in ad-
vance to protect against premium increases later that are due to age,
but added premiums are charged later to account for medical infla-
tion. In a public program the inflation risk could be divided between
the beneficiary and the taxpayers.
Prefunding raises the awkward problem of a suitable prefunding
vehicle. If prefunding merely results in purchasing government

bonds that must be redeemed by a later generation of taxpayers,
there is no clear advantage. One can certainly argue that public
investment in infrastructure has a real payoff that enhances the
nation's ability to meet its future social obligations, but current
accounting of social insurance funds blurs any such connection and
leads to the possibility of using presumably dedicated income for
current consumption.

7. For Medicare costs I divided the Part A and Part B combined cost for each sex
in five-year age groups by the total (not just Medicare) population in that age
group. This might be viewed as the premium that each age group has to pay to
support Medicare beneficiaries in the group. The average of all of these rates,
weighted by the population in each age/sex group, gives the average "pre-
mium" that must be paid by each member of society to support the Medicare
program. This would now be about $800 annually (Medicare benefits outlays
for 1998 are projected to be about $223 billion, with a total U.S. population of
about 280 million). The fixed age/sex-specific rates are then applied to the
projected population for 2023, 2048, and 2073 using the Social Security Ad-
ministration's population projections under the 1998 trustees' reports. For
earnings I used the March 1997 Current Population Survey (CPS) to calculate
earnings per person in the same age/sex groups as used for Medicare cost and
calculated average income per capita.
