Introduction
Japan is a country that emphasizes its people's ethnic homo-
geneity. The Japanese subscribe to ethnic nationalism, which
is an ideology with the aim to develop an ethnically exclu-
sive and homogeneous nationhood (Kashiwazaki, 2011).
One manifestation of ethnic nationalism is the belief that
Japan is, or should be, a mono-ethnic society. In other words,
everyone who has Japanese nationality should be ethnically
Japanese, or Japanese citizenship should be exclusively for
the ethnic Japanese.
In addition to the ethnocultural conception of nationhood,
ethnic nationalism is manifested in the exclusionary
attitude or opinion of the Japanese. This is illustrated in the
following quote by the former director of the Tokyo
Immigration Bureau:
The native Japanese have lived as a single ethnic group for
nearly 1000 years and it will be a difficult task for them to build
friendly relationships with other ethnic groups. There will likely
be many who would prefer to deal only with other Japanese
people rather than foreigners with different customs and ideas.
(Sakanaka, 2005)
Sakanaka explains that given Japan's history as an island
populated by people with a shared culture and common out-
look, developing close relationships with people of different
cultures will not be easy. We will see in "Housing" and
"Discrimination Against Foreigners" sections that the
Japanese do "prefer to deal only with other Japanese people
rather than foreigners" in housing and customer service.
In the context of foreigners living in Japan, the exclusion-
ary attitude or opinion of the Japanese often translates into
the insistence that foreigners should do things the Japanese
way. In addition, because the Japanese are privileged and
foreigners are at a disadvantage in ethnic nationalism, for-
eigners have fewer rights:
It's natural that foreigners who come to Japan should do things
the Japanese way. It's strange that we provide special services
for them. We should not give them any special treatment. (Nagy,
2012, p. 133)
In addition to insisting that foreigners should do things the
same way as the Japanese do, the Japanese respondent above
from Nagy's study in Shinjuku, Tokyo, seems to be against
the provision of multilingual services. In other words, the
Japanese may have the right to have government services
offered to them in their native language but foreigners do
not, even though foreigners pay taxes too. The following
quote is from a foreign resident in the Nagoya area:
I know that, in Nagoya, when I transgress a system even when
that system is simply advisory like the date to pick up at the dry
cleaners . . . they have been very confrontational. I assume this

Some Manifestations of Japanese
Exclusionism
Liang Morita1
Abstract
The Japanese subscribe to ethnic nationalism, which is an ideology with the aim to develop an ethnically exclusive and
homogeneous nationhood. One manifestation of ethnic nationalism is the belief that Japan is, or should be, a mono-ethnic
society. Ethnic nationalism is manifested in the exclusionary attitude or opinion of the Japanese. In the context of foreigners
living in Japan, the exclusionary attitude or opinion of the Japanese often translates into the insistence that foreigners
should do things the Japanese way. This is unfriendly to foreigners living in Japan, to say the least. This article illustrates how
unwelcoming and inconvenient Japanese exclusionism can be by using two examples that directly affect foreigners: housing
and discrimination against foreigners.

is based on the fact that I am foreign and must comply with
Japanese rules to the very letter, but the exact rationale isn't
clear to me as I find it hard to see their point of view on this.1
(Morita, 2015, p. 18)
The respondent above was unhappy about the dry cleaner's
insistence on his suits being collected on a specified day, a
practice seen in some parts of the country. From the respon-
dent's point of view, he is the paying customer and should
therefore have the right to pick up at his convenience
(Respondent 1, personal communication, September 1, 2014).
The number of foreigners in Japan is increasing. The number
of foreign residents has doubled to 2.2 million over the past 20
years (Kingston, 2013). Signs of transformation are evident in
rising numbers of foreigners gaining permanent residency and
foreign wives (many from low-income countries) playing a key
role in rural areas. In some sectors facing a shortage of skilled
workers such as information technology, the government has
initiated a new fast-track permanent residency program that tar-
gets the relevant foreigners. Globalization, intensified interna-
tionalization, and the aging and declining Japanese population
all point toward the presence of more foreigners in Japan.
Housing discrimination and discrimination against for-
eigners are contemporary phenomena in Japanese society,
and this article identifies the discourse of Japanese homoge-
neity and ethnic nationalism as main factors shaping this
exclusion. Discrimination against foreigners in many parts of
the country is documented in works such as Lee, Murphy-
Shigematsu, and Befu (2006) and Willis and Murphy-
Shigematsu (2008). Discrimination against the Ainu and
Zainichi Koreans2 is discussed in Maher and Macdonald
(1995). Fukuoka and Tsujiyama (2011) also focus on Zainichi
Koreans. The experiences of Nikkeijin3 are described in
works such as Noguchi and Fotos (2001), Green (2010),
Takenoshita (2013), and Takenoshita (2015). This article is
consistent with and contributes to the existing literature.
Ethnic nationalism, particularly in the form of exclusion-
ary attitudes or opinions of the Japanese, is unfriendly to for-
eigners living in Japan, to say the least. This article illustrates
how unwelcoming and inconvenient Japanese exclusionism
can be by using two examples that directly affect foreigners:
housing ("Housing" section) and discrimination against for-
eigners ("DiscriminationAgainst Foreigners" section). Many
foreigners looking for housing have had the experience of
being refused service by estate agents, and even after having
found a willing estate agent, many find the guarantor require-
ment challenging. Discrimination against foreigners is not
illegal in Japan, and racist incidents are fairly common, espe-
cially in the form of refusal of service by businesses.
Housing
"Open and blatant housing discrimination against foreigners
is common in Japan" (Befu, 2006, p. 3). Refusal of service
by estate agents is widely reported in the literature. Most
estate agents refuse to rent out their properties to foreigners.
A recent case of a Belgian student in Kyoto who was told he
could not rent a flat because he was a foreigner was reported
in The Japan Times (Scott, 2013). Recently, a colleague of
the author who was looking for housing was turned down
by 9 out of 10 estate agents, citing "Japanese only" as the
reason.
Ruru mamoranai ("to disobey rule(s)") is often cited by
estate agents as the reason for refusing to rent out properties
to foreigners. The rules in question can be the correct days
for putting out the correct rubbish or minimizing noise.
Estate agents sometimes simply state that foreigners do not
understand the Japanese language or do not know Japanese
culture and, therefore, they do not want to rent out properties
to foreigners. Befu (2006) points out that most Japanese
regard these as reasonable excuses for not renting to foreign-
ers, regardless of the foreigner's actual grasp of the Japanese
language or culture.
After having found estate agents who are willing to serve
them, foreigners are still not out of the woods. Guarantor or
co-signers are usually required of renters in Japan. Guarantors
pay the rent if tenants fall behind or cause damage to the
property. Landlords prefer relatives as guarantors, especially
parents who are still working. One option is to have employ-
ers serve as guarantors, but this only applies to those with
jobs lined up and companies willing to commit. Even then,
using an employer as guarantor is potentially problematic.
Changing jobs can be difficult. If the tenant loses his or her
job, he or she could have nowhere to live. Another option is
shared houses or dormitories for foreigners, but group living
has its drawbacks. Some companies specialize in short-term
rentals for foreigners with no guarantors, but these properties
are often not centrally located. There are companies that
offer to act as guarantors for a fee, but some of them require
their clients to provide guarantors before they agree to pro-
vide the service (Lewis, 2013).
The guarantor system has existed in Japan in various
forms since feudal times. In the Edo Period, tenants needed
caretakers who managed properties for landlords to act as
guarantors for them if they wanted to rent, marry, or travel
through official checkpoints. The current law concerning
guarantors dates back to the Meiji Era, when the Civil Code
was written in 1896. Some aspects of the Civil Code are cur-
rently being reviewed but the guarantor requirement for rent-
ers is not one of them. This requirement and the vertical
relationship between landlord and renter persist to this day
(Lewis, 2013).
Many foreigners do not know anyone in Japan when they
first arrive, making it almost impossible to find a guarantor.
According to one of the respondents in Morita (2015) who
found the guarantor requirement challenging,
[I strongly disagree that it was easy for me to find housing in
Japan.] It was very difficult to find housing in Japan. Based on
my experience, it took me more than 3 months to finally find an
Morita 3
apartment. The guarantor issue was the biggest hurdle for me. I
had to wait for my application for guarantor to be approved by
the university. So for 3 months, I stayed at Freebell apartments
which do not require guarantor or deposit. It was a bit expensive
staying there, though. (p. 10)
The respondent above had to wait for a period of time for his
request for his employer to serve as his guarantor to be pro-
cessed. While he waited, he paid a premium for accommoda-
tion that did not have a guarantor requirement. When his
application to his employer was finally approved, his
employer took out 2 months'rent from his salary as collateral
(Respondent 2, personal communication, September 1, 2014).
Discrimination Against Foreigners
When United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
(UNHCHR) Doudou Diene visited Japan in 2005, he reported
the existence of racism, racial discrimination, and xenopho-
bia. In his report (UNHCHR, 2006), he called on the Japanese
government to acknowledge the existence of racial discrimi-
nation and show the political will to combat it. He also rec-
ommended that a national anti-discrimination law should be
passed and implemented, which to this day, has not.
The Japanese Constitution prohibits discrimination, but
the degree to which this can be enforced in practice is unclear.
According to Article 14, "All of the people are equal under
the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, eco-
nomic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social
status or family origin." The traditional view of a constitu-
tion is that it protects an individual from the government, but
it does not necessarily extend to discrimination by private
individuals. There is also a lack of sound legislation to ensure
these protections are upheld. This is in sharp contrast to
countries such as the United States in which it is spelled out
explicitly in legislation that discrimination is illegal. The
lack of a statutory regime to enforce constitutional principles
means that Japan takes a soft line when it comes to discour-
aging discrimination. It may be possible to challenge a par-
ticular incident through the courts or by bringing a complaint
to a human rights committee, but neither may lead to a con-
crete result in terms of remedies (Scott, 2013).
Japan is unique in that there are no laws protecting the
livelihoods or rights of non-Japanese. One hundred twenty-
six cases of discrimination toward foreigners were reported
to the Bureau of Human Rights in 2007, which include
refusal of service by estate agents, hot springs, and hotels.
The Bureau only has the power to issue setsuji ("explana-
tion" or "warning"), not redress measures.
The Japanese government ratified the International
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
Discrimination (ICERD) in 1995, which is one of the most
widely ratified human rights conventions in the world.
Despite ICERD's recommendation to the Japanese govern-
ment in 2001 to adopt specific legislation to outlaw racial
discrimination, the Japanese Civil or Criminal Code still has
no law specifically outlawing racial discrimination. Racial
discrimination is unconstitutional and unlawful under the
ICERD, yet not illegal (Arudou, 2010).
Ana Bortz, A Brazilian journalist living in Japan, took to
court the owner of a jewelry shop who refused to serve her
because of her nationality. She won the case on the basis of
the ICERD. In 1999, the judge ruled that she had suffered
discrimination and ordered compensation.
Refusal of service to foreigners is fairly common in Japan.
In the high-profile Otaru onsen ("hot spring") case (1993-
2005), "Japanese only" signs barred entry to foreigners in
Otaru, Hokkaido. The following respondent in Morita (2015)
had similar experiences:
Once or twice I haven't been allowed into a Japanese onsen or a
Japanese bar/izakaya because I wasn't Japanese. (p. 7)
Sakanaka's (2005) prediction, that "there will likely be many
who would prefer to deal only with other Japanese people
rather than foreigners with different customs and ideas," has
come true, particularly in customer service. Businesses
would rather forgo the profit they could potentially make
from foreign customers than to serve foreigners. In March
2014, the "Japanese only" banner displayed at the Urawa
Reds football match received negative publicity all over the
world.
Refusal of service comes in more subtle forms, too:
I have popped into a few small Japanese women's clothing
stores where they used one English word to insult me and chase
me off "laaah-gie janai" [No large--I presume] they said this 3
syllable phrase over and over tittering with their friends who
were in the shop. It was very absurd. In another similar case the
woman followed me around and pointed out all the clothes to
insist they were not large--I presume they didn't want me to try
their clothes on, nor to frequent their shop!4
The respondent above is a medium-built Caucasian who
would be considered a Japanese size Large. It is possible that
the shops she visited stocked clothes up to Medium only. In
any case, it is clear that the shops wanted her to leave, and the
way they conveyed their message is unacceptable. The same
method would never be used with Japanese customers.
There is a lack of awareness among the Japanese that for-
eigners in Japan do not enjoy the rights and privileges of the
Japanese (Willis, 2006). In a Cabinet survey in 2011, 59.3% of
the respondents answered "yes" to the question "Should for-
eigners have the same human rights protections as Japanese?"
(Arudou, 2011). According to Saga Prefecture public prosecu-
tor, Hiroshi Ichikawa, he was taught that foreigners had no
human rights. Even the Japanese Constitution speaks of defin-
ing equality and fundamental human rights as being condi-
tioned on nationality rather than being human.A2008 Supreme
Court decision made it clear that citizenship is essential to
enjoying constitutional and human rights in Japan. There are
different standards in civil and criminal courts for citizens and
4 SAGE Open
non-citizens. The government has repeatedly claimed
through explicit exceptions and caveats made when signing
treaties that non-citizens do not qualify for protection against
racial discrimination or for equal civil and political rights
(Arudou, 2011).
AMinistry of InternalAffairs and Communications (MIC;
2006) report admits that previous efforts to tackle the
inequalities faced by foreign residents have been insuffi-
cient: "It is hard to say that the corresponding actions of the
ministries and government offices have been adequate, nor
can it be denied that there has been a lack of comprehensive,
cross-cutting measures" (p. 2).
There is some differentiation and stratification within the
category of foreigners on the basis of country of origin and
occupation. According to Kobayashi (2010), the Japanese
discriminates against foreign residents of the same or darker
color or English speakers with an "accent" (i.e., non-native
speakers of English). In her study, she refers to a survey in
which half of the Latin American respondents (n = 115)
experienced discrimination due to their skin color or nation-
ality. A similar differentiation can be found below:
From my peers I learned that the image of "foreigner" associated
with the term gaijin is of Caucasian, blue-eyed, fair-haired
people. They are generally seen as more intelligent and
financially better-off. . . . But there's also a non-Caucasian
image, referring to other Asians. They're regarded as lower
status than Japanese: poor, unintelligent and badly educated. . . .
I used to be told that Kankokujin (South Koreans) were OK, but
Chosenjin (North Koreans) were really low status, along with
Chinese, Filipino and other Asians. (Maher & Macdonald, 1995,
pp. 252-253)
Discussion
Prioritizing the protection of the perceived ethnic homogene-
ity of Japan does not always led to the best solution. Japan
holds dear the principle of not allowing unskilled migration
because of its perceived negative consequences for Japanese
society. In the revision of the Immigration Act in 1998, the
government allowed the migration of unskilled nikkei
Brazilians, granting them unrestricted working visas of vari-
ous lengths based on their presumed Japaneseness. This is
based on the rationale that the Japanese blood in the nikkei
Brazilians meant the homogeneity of Japan would be pre-
served. However, this line of reasoning proved to be flawed.
These Latin Americans, even though of Japanese descent,
turned out to be more different and foreign than workers
from neighboring Asian countries, neither speaking the
Japanese language nor practicing Japanese culture.
Holding dear Japanese exclusionism is not always in
Japan's best interests either. Japan has Economic Partnership
Agreements (EPAs) with Indonesia, the Philippines, and,
more recently, Vietnam. The EPAs provide the regulations for
the migration of nurses and caregivers from these countries.
Despite the acute shortage of registered nurses and caregiv-
ers, a problem particularly pressing in the face of a growing
elderly population, the EPAs are described as "a window-
dressing to a strong, clear, and prevailing no to opening
Japan's borders to an international workforce" (Vogt, 2013,
p. 18). The Japanese government would rather alleviate the
shortage by increasing the labor market participation of
youth and women and the use of care robots and technology.
This reflects the difficulties Japan has in coming to terms
with accepting and welcoming international labor migrants
in large numbers. Japanese exclusionism is also manifested
in the fact that the nurses'and caregivers'previously acquired
skills are not fully acknowledged. Regardless of their work
status in their respective countries, they have to work as
nursing assistants and assistant caregivers in Japan until they
pass the national examination (Vogt, 2013).
The national examination is a major obstacle to nurses
and caregivers from Indonesia and the Philippines. The
examination is in Japanese, and passing it is a necessary step
for being employed as certified nurses and caregivers as well
as being granted long-term residency in Japan.An Indonesian
nurse praised the efforts of a Japanese doctor who helped her
with her medical vocabulary for 2 hr every evening for a
year. She passed the national examination in her second
attempt. However, she reported she was bullied by Japanese
nurses, who considered her more of a burden than an equal
coworker (Vogt, 2013).
When the Japanese government started campaigning for
internationalization in the mid-1980s, insularity and tenden-
cies toward exclusionism were criticized and regarded as
obstacles in the process of globalization. According to a
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA; 1985) Blue Paper, "It is
necessary to overcome our insular/exclusionary quality by
developing the ability to tolerate and accept differences"
(cited in Kashiwazaki, 2013, p. 38). Not only does the gov-
ernment acknowledge Japanese exclusionism, it is aware that
exclusionism can be a hindrance. More recently, politicians
have accepted the fact that welcoming foreigners is neces-
sary given the aging and declining population. It is regarded
as a necessary step to ensure Japan's future competitiveness
(Ministry of Justice [MOJ], 2010, cited in Yamamoto, 2012).
It is not possible to welcome foreigners if they are per-
ceived as agents disrupting the homogeneous social fabric of
Japan. Issues pertaining to foreigners are often referred to as
gaigokujin mondai ("foreigner problem"). The choice of the
word mondai reflects the perception that foreigners contrib-
ute little to Japanese society, and that they have come to
Japan to make money and have brought problems with them.
An example of a gaigokujin mondai discussed in the media
is education for foreign children. Many Japanese do not see
provision of education for foreign children as the responsi-
bility of the host society that benefits from the economic
contribution made by foreigners. Sakanaka (2005) shares
this view:
Morita 5
We do not often see Japanese people praising the work of foreign
residents and warmly welcoming them as friends and colleagues.
. . . It is far more common to hear of problems--problems
adjusting to society, problems with children's education,
problems of discriminatory treatment, housing problems, social
insurance problems--the list goes on and on. (Sakanaka, 2005)
Foreigners are also perceived as "a burden," "disrupters of
the traditional patterns of Japanese life," and "causers of
problems." In Shinjuku, Tokyo, one of the reasons why
Japanese language classes, cultural classes, multilingual
advisory services, and publications are provided is so that
foreigners do not cause any intercultural friction or become a
burden to the local government and Japanese residents.
Shinjuku's multicultural coexistence practices have a strong
focus on preventing intercultural friction between the
Japanese and foreign residents. According to the managing
directorofInternationalExchangeattheShinjukuFoundation
for Culture and International Exchange,
Multicultural existence practices are not about creating a
municipality that minorities want to come to; rather, it is about
maintaining the integrity of the Japanese community, ensuring
that the foreigners that do settle temporarily or for the long term
don'tdisruptthetraditionalpatternsofJapaneselife.Multicultural
coexistence programs provide foreign residents with knowledge
about Japanese customs and manners so they can avoid causing
problems with Japanese residents. (Nagy, 2012, p. 132)
Foreigners can be invaluable assets and should be
acknowledged as such:
. . . international migrants themselves--as part of border-
crossing flows--can be invaluable assets to each country's
innovative potential, and should be acknowledged as such. By
solely contemplating about the risks international migration
poses to social stability and wage levels, we forfeit an opportunity
to embrace their vibrant and diverse input to our societies,
politics, and economics. (Vogt, 2013, p. 37)
Japanese exclusionism and the insistence on maintaining the
perceived ethnic homogeneity of Japan has prevented the
Japanese from embracing foreigners' contribution to the
country. Sakanaka (2005) suggests that Japan needs to move
away from valuing homogeneity.
In the face of a rapidly aging and declining population and
global competition, Japan's future will depend on whether it
can accept and welcome foreigners:
Japan must recognize that globalization is here to stay, and should
stake its very survival on accepting people elsewhere in the world
as its brethren, and transforming itself into a much more
multicultural, diverse society. It will be a large task, but Japan is
past the point where easy solutions will do. (Sakanaka, 2011)
Stopping the tide of globalization is impossible. The Japanese
can no longer live in a "Japanese only" world. Regardless of
personal preference, the Japanese will have to live with immi-
grants in some capacity (Sakanaka, 2005).5
