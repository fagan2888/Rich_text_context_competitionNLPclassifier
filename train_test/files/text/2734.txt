Abstract: Background: Discrimination is a common experience for Blacks across various
developmental periods. Although much is known about the effect of discrimination on suicidal
ideation of adults, less is known about the same association in Black youth. Aim: We examined the
association between discrimination and suicidal ideation in a national sample of Black youth. We also
explored gender and ethnic differences in this association. Methods: We used data from the National
Survey of American Life-Adolescents (NSAL-A), 2003­2004. In total, 1170 Black adolescents entered
the study. This number was composed of 810 African American and 360 Caribbean Black youth
(aged 13 to 17 years). Demographic and socioeconomic factors were controls, perceived discrimination
was the predictor, and lifetime suicidal ideation was the outcome. Logistic regression was used to test
the association between perceived discrimination and suicidal ideation in the pooled sample, as well
as based on ethnicity and gender. Results: In the pooled sample of Black youth, higher perceived
discrimination was associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.09;
95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.02-1.17). This association was significant net of age, ethnicity,
gender, and socioeconomic status. We did not find interactions between perceived discrimination
and ethnicity or gender on suicidal ideation. Perceived discrimination was associated with suicidal
ideation in African Americans (CI = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.01-1.17) and Caribbean Blacks (CI = 1.16;
95% CI = 1.03-1.32), males (CI = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.00-1.25), and females (CI = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.00-1.16).
Conclusion: Discrimination jeopardizes the mental health of Black youth. In a universal pattern,
discrimination is associated with suicidal ideation in Black youth. More research is needed on
this topic.

1. Background
The harmful effects of discrimination on the mental health of Black populations are well
established [1­3]. However, less is known about the same effects in Black youth. The current study aims
to examine the effect of discrimination on suicidal ideation in Black youth. This study also examines
ethnicity and gender differences in the association between discrimination and suicidal ideation.
Discrimination is defined as differential and unjust treatment of individuals because of particular
identities such as race, ethnicity, age, gender [4]. In the United States, Blacks experience high levels of
discrimination, which increases the risk of undesired mental health outcomes such as psychological
symptoms [5­10] and categorical psychiatric disorders [11]. A recent meta-analysis suggested that
exposure to racial discrimination increases poor mental health outcomes for Blacks [11]. Similar to
Behav. Sci. 2017, 7, 75; doi:10.3390/bs7040075 www.mdpi.com/journal/behavsci
Behav. Sci. 2017, 7, 75 2 of 10
other stressors, the context in which discrimination happens has an important role in changing the
effect of discrimination [12,13].
Although the negative effect of discrimination on the mental health of adults is well
documented [2,11,14,15], fewer studies have focused on the negative influence of discrimination
on the mental health of Black youth [16­19]. In Black youth, discrimination is linked to stress [19],
low self-esteem [18,19], and psychiatric disorders [20]. Discrimination is also associated with
depressive symptoms [18,19] as well as clinical depression [17].
Black youth may become more aware of their identities during their transition to adolescence and
adulthood, and therefore may be sensitive to discriminatory experiences that relate to their racial and
general identities [21,22]. As a result, discrimination experiences may become extremely important
for the mental health and well-being of adolescents [23,24]. The negative impact of exposure to
discrimination on the mental health of Blacks persists over time [17,25]. Cheng et al. [26] showed that
discrimination in adolescence predicts future depression among Black youth. Sellers and Shelton have
discussed how discrimination and identities interact among Black youth [27].
Gibbons et al. [28] showed that nine out of 10 Black adolescents report having had at least
one experience of racial discrimination. Black adolescents experience discrimination across settings,
including but not limited to school [29,30]. Although a wide range of mental health outcomes has been
linked to discrimination, less is known about the effect of discrimination on suicide and Black youth.
Discrimination, however, may not have similar effects across all groups of Blacks.
Hudson et al. [31] have shown that high discrimination may have stronger effects in the presence of
high socioeconomic status (SES). Racial identity may also alter the effects of discrimination on mental
health [32]. A number [27,33,34] but not all [10] studies have also shown that discrimination may have
stronger effects for males than females, particularly in the presence of high masculine ideologies [35].
An interaction between ethnicity and gender has also been shown to alter these effects [3,10].
2. The Current Study
This study investigated the effects of discrimination, ethnicity, gender, and SES on suicidal
ideation in a national sample of Black youth. We also tested gender and ethnic differences in this
regard. We hypothesized that discrimination will be associated with more suicidal ideation for all
groups of Black youth.
3. Method
3.1. Design and Setting
This is a cross-sectional study. We used data from the National Survey of American
Life-Adolescent Supplement (NSAL-A), 2003 [9,36]. The NSAL was conducted as a part of the
Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES) [37]. The NSAL-A is one of the largest
national mental health surveys of Black youth in the United States [38].
3.2. Ethics
The University of Michigan Institute Review Board approved the NSAL study. Adolescents'
legal guardians provided informed written consent. All adolescents provided assent themselves.
Respondents received $50 as financial compensation. The study was funded by the National Institute
of Mental Health (NIMH) and was conducted by the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.
3.3. Participants
The study enrolled 1170 Black adolescents, including 810 African Americans and 360 Caribbean
Blacks. Participating youth ranged in age from 13 to 17 years. At the time of the study, all participants
resided in the United States. More detailed information on the sampling strategy is available
elsewhere [37,38].
Behav. Sci. 2017, 7, 75 3 of 10
3.4. Sampling
The NSAL-Adolescent sample was drawn from the NSAL, a national probability sample of adult
Blacks in the United States. The NSAL-adult sample was screened for African American and Caribbean
Black households with eligible adolescents living in the households. Adolescents living in households
were randomly selected for participation. If more than one eligible adolescent lived in a household,
two adolescents were selected based on the gender of the first eligible adolescent. This strategy resulted
in non-independence for adolescent samples. In response to this lack of independence, the adolescent
supplement data were weighted to adjust for non-independence of the selection probabilities and
non-response at the household and individual levels. The weighted data were then post-stratified to
represent national estimates based on gender, age, and ethnicity [9,10].
3.5. Interviews
All interviews were conducted in English. Interviews lasted 100 minutes on average. The overall
response rate was 80.6%. The response rate was slightly higher for Caribbean Black youth (83.5%) than
for African American youth (80.4%).
For the majority (82%) of the interviews, data collection occurred during in-person interviews
conducted in the adolescents' homes. The remaining 18% of interviews were conducted entirely or
partially by telephone. All in-person interviews used computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPIs).
With CAPI, computers are used by trained interviewers to conduct the interviews. CAPI is the
preferred method of interviewing for long and complex questionnaires.
4. Measures
Sociodemographics: The study included demographic factors, such as age, gender, and ethnicity.
Socioeconomic status (SES) was also measured. For SES, we used the poverty index, defined as the
income-to-needs ratio from the 2001 United States Census. The poverty index was calculated by
dividing household income by the poverty threshold [39]. Higher scores on the poverty index indicate
higher SES.
Ethnicity: Ethnicity was the self-identified ethnicity of the family household in which the
adolescent lived. Participants self-identified as either African Americans or Caribbean Blacks.
African American was defined as Black without having ancestral ties to the Caribbean. Caribbean Black
was defined as Black having ancestral ties to a country included on a list of Caribbean countries
provided by the interviewer, or that the particpant's parents or grandparents were born in a
Caribbean country. Caribbean countries included Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bahamas,
Cuba, Dominican Republic, Dominica, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,
Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Lucia, and Saint Kitts and Nevis.
Discrimination: NSAL-A used a 13-item modified version of the Everyday Discrimination Scale
(EDS) to measure discrimination. These items assess chronic, routine, and less overt discriminatory
experiences that have occurred over the past year [40]. Although the original measure includes
10 items, NSAL-A has added three additional items that reflect perceived teacher discrimination.
Although this measure was originally developed and normalized among adults, it also operates
well for adolescents [9,40,41]. Respondents were asked: "In your day-to-day life, how often have
any of the following things happened to you?" Sample items include: "being followed around in
stores", "people acting as if they think you are dishonest", "receiving poorer service than other
people at restaurants", and "being called names or insulted". The Likert response scale ranged from 1
(never) to 6 (almost every day). A sum score was calculated, reflecting the frequency of exposure to
discriminatory events over the past year ( = 0.86).
Suicidal ideation: Lifetime serious suicidal ideation was asked using the following single-item
measure: Did the following experience ever happen to you? "You seriously thought about killing
yourself". Single-item measures of suicidal ideation have been frequently used in large-scale national
Behav. Sci. 2017, 7, 75 4 of 10
epidemiological studies [34,42­44]. Only 11.3% of participants that endorse a single-item suicide
attempt engage in behavior that would not meet the standard definition of a suicide attempt. Similarly,
only 8.8% of individuals who endorse a single-item measure of suicidal ideation endorse thoughts that
would not meet standard definitions of suicidal ideation. These are indicative of an acceptable validity
of a single-item measure of suicidal ideation [45].
5. Statistical Analysis
To accommodate the complex design of the NSAL-A, Stata 13.0 (Stata Corp., College Station,
TX, USA) was used for data analysis. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals
were reported.
We used the Taylor expansion approximation technique to re-calculate the complex design-based
estimates of variance. Standard errors reflect the weights due to the complex sampling design.
All percentages reported in this study are weighted. As the Caribbean Black sample is more clustered
than the African American sample, the standard errors are systematically larger for Caribbean Black
than that for African American youth. As a result, findings are more conservative for Caribbean
Black youth.
We used survey logistic regression for multivariable analysis. In our model, discrimination was
the main predictor, lifetime suicidal ideation was the main outcome, and age, gender, ethnicity,
and the poverty index were covariates. We fit multiple logistic regression models to determine
the role of discrimination on suicidal ideation in the pooled sample as the subgroups. In the first
step, the association of interest was estimated in the pooled sample. In the next step, we added the
interaction terms (between discrimination and ethnicity or gender) to the model. Finally, we ran
models specific to ethnicity and gender.
From logistic regressions, we reported Odds Ratios (ORs) and associated 95% Confidence Intervals
(CIs). p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Missing data was not imputed.
We used complete case analysis for our regression models.
6. Results
6.1. Descriptive Statistics
The sample was evenly composed of boys (n = 563, 48%) and girls (n = 605, 52%). The mean
age of the participants was 15 years (SD = 1.42). Of the sample, 40% were between the ages of 13
and 14 years (n = 477), 41% were between the ages 15 and 16 years (n = 441), and 19% were age 17
years (n = 252). Most (96%) participants were enrolled in high school. The median family income was
US$28,000, with a range from 0 to US$520,000.
6.2. Bivariate Associations
Caribbean Blacks (US$32,250) had a higher median income than African Americans (US$26,000)
(p < 0.001). Caribbean Blacks were also older than African Americans (p < 0.05). The proportion of
girls was marginally higher for Caribbean Blacks than African Americans (p < 0.1). African Americans
and Caribbean Blacks reported similar levels of discrimination. However, boys reported significantly
higher levels of discrimination compared to girls (p < 0.05). African Americans and Caribbean Blacks
did not differ in suicidal ideation (p = 0.586). Suicidal ideation was more common among girls than
boys (OR = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.01­3.16, p = 0.045) (Table 1).

6.3. Logistic Regression Models in the Pooled Sample
Table 2 summarizes the results of four logistic regressions in the pooled sample, with suicidal
ideation as the outcome, discrimination as the predictor, and age, gender, ethnicity, and the poverty
index as covariates. Model 1 only included the main effects. In Model 2, we included an interaction
term between ethnicity and discrimination. Model 3 included an interaction term between gender and
discrimination. Model 4 included both interaction terms (Table 2).

Model 1 in the pooled sample of Black youth showed that higher perceived discrimination was
associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.02­1.17). This association was
significant above and beyond age, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status. Models 2 to 4 did not
find any interactions between ethnicity or gender with perceived discrimination on suicidal ideation
(Table 2).
6.4. Logistic Regression Models Based on Ethnicity and Gender
Table 3 presents the results of four logistic regression models with discrimination as the predictor
and suicidal ideation as the outcome in ethnic and gender groups. Perceived discrimination was
associated with suicidal ideation in African Americans (CI = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.01­1.17), Caribbean Blacks
(CI = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.03­1.32), males (CI = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.00­1.25), and females (CI = 1.08;
95% CI = 1.00­1.16) (Table 3).

7. Discussion
The current study found an association between discrimination and suicidal ideation in a national
sample of Black youth. Discrimination was a universal risk factor for suicidal ideation among Black
youth, regardless of their ethnicity or gender.
The effect of discrimination as a risk factor for suicidal ideation among Black youth is in line
with research showing that discrimination jeopardizes a wide range of mental health outcomes for
adolescents [11] as well as adults [40,41]. In a recent study, we found that discrimination predicted the
deterioration of the mental health of Blacks decades later [46].
We did not find gender differences in the association between discrimination and suicidal ideation
of Black youth. At least three previous studies have shown the stronger effects of discrimination on
undesired mental health outcomes for males than females [27,46,47]. Discrimination was particularly
detrimental for Black males who had high SES [31,48] or high masculinity ideologies [35].
The differences observed between the results of this study and previous research on
gender differences in the link between discrimination and suicide may be in part due to
sampling (national datasets versus local sample), study setting (clinical versus community studies),
or developmental age (early, mid, late adolescents, and emerging adults). It is not clear whether
gender differences in suicidal ideation become more significant during emerging adulthood or not.
It is also likely that gender differences are more pronounced for mental health outcomes rather than
suicidal ideation.
Our study showed gender differences in exposure to discrimination, with males reporting more
discrimination than females. There are other studies showing that among Blacks, males report
higher rates of perceived discrimination compared to females [49,50]. Such gender differences in
discrimination may be due to measurement or due to salience of dominance and hierarchy for
males [51]. Discrimination may be more common among Black men [52] as they also experience mass
incarceration and police brutality [53]. In addition, Black men may be more prone to its effects [51].
In a recent study of Black men, discrimination fully mediated the effect of incarceration history on
poor mental health outcomes [16].
The current study did not find any ethnic differences in the effects of discrimination on suicidal
ideation among Black male and female youth. These results are different from the previous studies
that have shown ethnic differences in mental health effects of discrimination among Blacks. In the first
study, Seaton et al. [9] reported a three-way interaction between ethnicity, gender, and discrimination
on the mental health outcomes of Black youth. Specifically, the effects of perceived discrimination on
depressive symptoms and life satisfaction were stronger for Caribbean Black females compared to
African American males. In the second study using a national sample of Black adults, Assari, Watkins,
and Caldwell [3] found a three-way interaction between gender, ethnicity, and race attribution on
Behav. Sci. 2017, 7, 75 7 of 10
clinical depression. The study showed the strongest effect of discrimination on depression among
Caribbean Black males who did not see race as a major barrier against upward social mobility.
Ethnicity may alter susceptibility to discrimination through ethnic identity [32], social class [31],
and expectations [54].
Although we found that females reported more suicidal ideation than males and males reported
more discrimination than females in the current study, we did not find the same ethnicity by gender
differences in the effects of discrimination on suicidal ideation as other studies with different mental
health outcomes. This finding suggests that the nature of suicidal ideation in the face of discrimination
is equally harmful for all groups of Black youth.
8. Limitations
This study had a few limitations. First, given the cross-sectional design of the study,
the associations reported here should not be interpreted as causation. Second, the sample size was
not identical across gender and ethnic groups. Third, the main outcome was evaluated using a
single-item measure. Although this is a common approach in studying suicidal ideation in large-scale
national studies [34,42­44], more comprehensive measures provide results with higher validity [55].
Fourth, a wide range of unmeasured factors such as negative life events, history of trauma and
abuse, family support, psychiatric disorders, and access to healthcare may confound the results.
Religious involvement, family support, ethnic identity, race-related attitudes, and attribution system
may all alter the mental health consequences of discrimination.
9. Future Directions
Future research might delineate ways to focus on protective factors as well as effective
interventions that can undo racism and discrimination. Additional research is needed with a more
comprehensive set of control variables. A host of variables may contribute to the observed association
between experiences of discrimination and suicidal ideation. For example, negative affectivity,
neuroticism, or vigilance could be third variables that contribute to both perceived discrimination
and suicidal ideation. There is also a need for studies that delve into mechanisms that link perceived
discrimination to suicidal ideation. Furthermore, there is a need to study higher levels and structural
factors that shape the mental health of Black youth. Research should also test whether interventions
are similarly effective for different gender and ethnic groups.
10. Conclusions
In summary, in line with the literature that shows that discrimination jeopardizes other mental
health outcomes, we found that discrimination was associated with suicidal ideation in Black youth.
This association was found to be universal regardless of the ethnicity or gender of the youth.
