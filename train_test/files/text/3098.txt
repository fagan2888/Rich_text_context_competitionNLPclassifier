HOW WELL DO THE NATION'S
methadone maintenance
treatment facilities meet es-
tablished standards for best
practice care?
This is a critical question for public
health policy and, more broadly, for so-
cial policy.1 Changes in methadone
treatment practices are important in re-
sponding to the changing prevalence
and modalities of heroin use, to the con-
tinued role of injection drug use in the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
and hepatitis C epidemics, and to
changes in the financing and regula-
tion of methadone treatment. Assess-
ing methadone treatment practices is
also important in light of recent re-
search results about methadone treat-
ment effectiveness.
An upsurge in heroin use has in-
creased the need for effective treat-
ment services for opioid dependence.
Admissions for opioid dependence have
surpassed admissions for cocaine abuse
in the nation's drug abuse treatment
programs.2 Population-based epide-
miological studies also show a marked
increase in heroin use.3 The Office of
National Drug Control Policy now es-
timates that the number of heroin us-
ers in the United States has increased
by more than half in less than a de-
cade, from 600000 in the early 1990s
to 980000 in 2001.4
Analysts agree that increased heroin
use is influenced by declining heroin
prices and by increased purity. In-
creased purity creates additional con-
cern because this may increase the ad-
dictive potential of street heroin.5
Average pure heroin content con-
tained in a $100 purchase has in-
creased 3-fold between 1988 and 1995
in cities across the United States.5 High
purityalsofacilitatesnoninjectingforms
of heroin use, such as smoking and
snorting, which may attract new users
who are deterred by injection-related
risks. Newly available modalities of
heroin use may thus have attracted new
users, most of whom are younger than
26 years of age.2 The long-term risk be-
haviors of noninjection heroin users are
currently unknown. Public health con-
sequences would be significant if ini-
tial noninjectors frequently convert to
needle use.
Injection heroin use also remains
central to HIV transmission and to the
transmission of other infectious agents.6
Many studies indicate that methadone
treatment is associated with reduced
HIV seroconversion among metha-
done patients and is also associated with
reduced needle-sharing and other risk
behaviors.7,8 A recent Institute of Medi-
cine report concludes, as have previ-
ous expert reports,1,8 that effective
methadone treatment for opioid de-
pendence is critical to prevent HIV
transmission. The majority of injec-

Context Results from several studies conducted in the early 1990s showed that the
majority of US methadone maintenance programs did not use treatment practices that
met established standards for the care of heroin users. Effective treatment for heroin
users is critical given the upsurge in heroin use and the continued role of injection drug
use in the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C epidemics.
Objectives To examine the extent to which US methadone maintenance treatment
programs have made changes in the past 12 years to provide adequate methadone
doses and to identify factors associated with variation in program performance.
Design, Setting, and Participants Program directors and clinical supervisors of
nationally representative methadone treatment programs that varied by ownership (for-
profit, public, or private not-for-profit) and setting (eg, free-standing, hospital-based)
were surveyed in 1988 (n=172), 1990 (n=140), 1995 (n=116), and 2000 (n=150).
Main Outcome Measures Percentage of patients in each treatment program re-
ceiving methadone dosages of less than 40, 60, and 80 mg/d.
Results The percentage of patients receiving methadone dosage levels less than the
recommended 60 mg/d has decreased from 79.5% in 1988 to 35.5% in 2000. Re-
sults also show that programs with a greater percentage of African American patients
are especially likely to dispense low dosages, while programs with Joint Commission
on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations accreditation are more likely to provide
adequate methadone doses.
Conclusions Efforts to improve methadone treatment practices appear to be mak-
ing progress, but many patients are still receiving substandard care.

tion drug users have now contracted
hepatitis C. Effective methadone treat-
ment may be important to slowing this
epidemic as well.9,10
Moreover, important changes are
occurring in financing and regulation
that may carry significant implications
for methadone treatment effectiveness.
One prominent change is the intro-
duction of managed care as a payment
and administrative mechanism for
methadone treatment. Although a
recent study indicates that methadone
treatment programs are less likely to
be involved in managed care than are
their nonmethadone counterparts,11
some 30% of all methadone treatment
programs participate in some form of
managed care.11 For those programs
and the tens of thousands of patients
they serve, managed care can poten-
tially improve treatment practices. At
the same time, managed care might
hinder treatment effectiveness through
practices such as limiting treatment
duration, a central factor in treatment
effectiveness.12,13
A second prominent change is the
pending move to regulate methadone
treatment facilities through the Cen-
ter for Substance Abuse Treatment
(CSAT) rather than through the Drug
Enforcement Agency and the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA). This sub-
stantial shift was prompted by con-
cerns about quality of care in metha-
done treatment programs.14,15 The
CSAT, which is part of the federal Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Health Ser-
vices Administration, brings exten-
sive experience working with treatment
programs to improve quality. This regu-
latory shift may therefore create op-
portunities to improve patient care.
Finally, results from prior studies of
methadone treatment practices16 and
treatment effectiveness17 support the
need for a current assessment of treat-
ment practices. Data from the few na-
tional studies of methadone dose lev-
els published in the early 1990s indicate
that patients typically received subop-
timal doses.18-20 Data collected in 1988
from a nationally representative sample
of 172 methadone maintenance facili-
ties showed that the average dosage was
45 mg/d; 1990 data from the same panel
of facilities showed virtually identical
average dosages, 46 mg/d.18 Data from
a random sample of patient discharge
abstracts (N=261) at 26 randomly se-
lected treatment facilities in 1990
showed that the average methadone
dosage per day was 50 mg.19 Yet an-
other study of 24 methadone treat-
ment facilities conducted in 1990 by the
General Accounting Office concluded
that, on average, dose levels were too
low.20
Inresponsetothesestudyresults,sev-
eral initiatives were launched to im-
provetreatmentpractices.TheCSATde-
velopedmethadonetreatmentguidelines
and distributed them to state sub-
stance abuse agencies and to treatment
programs across the nation.21,22 The In-
stitute of Medicine convened a study
panelthatrecommendedseveralchanges
in treatment practices and their regula-
tion.14 Cooper23 published an editorial
encouraging physicians to use effective
dose levels. The National Institute on
Drug Abuse funded a study to examine
the development of a quality assurance
program for methadone treatment.15
More recently, a National Institutes of
Health consensus panel (1997) pro-
duced guidelines for effective metha-
done treatment practices.1
Subsequent surveys indicate at least
partial successes of such efforts. Na-
tional panel data indicate that metha-
done dosages increased significantly
from an average of 45 mg/d in 1988 to
59 mg/d in 1995.16 This increase raised
average dosages to the minimum level
recommended by national consensus
panels (60 mg/d).1 Other significant im-
provements in treatment practices were
documented over the same period. Av-
erage time in treatment increased from
20monthsto21months;theaverageup-
per dosage limit increased from 79 mg/d
to 93 mg/d; the percentage of patients
receiving progressively decreasing
methadone doses decreased from 34%
to 22%. Programs also waited longer be-
fore encouraging patients to detoxify
from methadone. In 1990, only 27% of
programs waited more than 1 year to en-
courage detoxification, but, by 1995,
55% of programs exceeded the same
threshold.
Although these trends reflect impor-
tantprogress,recentstudiessuggestthat
methadonedosagesbetween80and100
mg/d are more effective than are dos-
ages in the range of 60 to 80 mg/d.17,24
Strain et al17 randomly assigned pa-
tients at an urban treatment program
to a moderate (40-50 mg/d) or high (80-
100 mg/d) methadone dose group. Af-
ter 30 weeks, both patient self-report
and urinalysis indicated significantly
higher prevalence of recent opioid use
within the moderate-dose group. There
were no differences between the 2
groups in self-reported adverse effects
from methadone use. Thus, docu-
mented increases in methadone dose
levels may be insufficient to yield ef-
fective treatment outcomes. Given the
current price and purity of heroin, even
higher methadone doses may be war-
ranted.5,17
It is important to note, however, the
long-standing resistance to metha-
done maintenance treatment in gen-
eral, and in particular to high-dose,
long-term treatment.25,26 Some citi-
zens, drug users, and drug treatment
professionals and staff have expressed
concern that methadone treatment
"substitutes one addiction for an-
other." This view is particularly likely
to be held by individuals who support
an abstinence model of treatment and
recovery. Vaughn27 showed that the
more that clinical supervisors in metha-
done treatment programs supported an
abstinence model of treatment, the
more likely their programs were to pro-
vide low methadone doses.
In sum, the current study adds to
prior research16,28 by examining changes
in methadone treatment practices us-
ing 1988-2000 data from a nationally
representative panel of methadone
maintenance programs. We also exam-
ine how important characteristics of
these programs (eg, Joint Commis-
sion on Accreditation of Healthcare Or-
ganizations [JCAHO] accreditation) are
related to differences in average metha-
done dose levels.

METHODS
This study uses data from a panel sur-
vey conducted in 1988, 1990, 1995, and
2000 by the Institute for Social Re-
search at the University of Michigan and
by the National Opinion Research Cen-
ter at the University of Chicago.29
Sampling Frame
We define a methadone treatment unit
as a physical facility with resources
dedicated specifically to treating opi-
ate dependence through methadone.
Methadone programs with multiple
treatment units or multiple sites were
identified, and units were sampled ran-
domly from such programs. The ini-
tial sampling frame consisted of the
FDA's 1988 list of the nation's metha-
done maintenance treatment units
(N=587). Because the population of
methadone treatment units has changed
in the past several years as a result of
the founding of new treatment units,
we augmented the 1988 sampling frame
with the FDA's 1998 list of metha-
done units (N=871). Because the FDA
licenses all methadone providers, one
can identify the entire US population
of methadone treatment units with a
relatively high degree of certainty.
Sample
Of the 210 units selected for the 1988
study, 172 participated, a response rate
of 82%. Participating units did not dif-
fer significantly from nonrespondents
in 1988.18 Thus, in 1990, we con-
tacted only the participating units from
1988. Of these 172 units, 11 were no
longer providing methadone treat-
ment and thus 161 units were still eli-
gible for the study. Of the 161 eligible
units, 140 (87%) participated in the
1990 study. In 1995, we contacted the
140 participating units that provided
methadone in 1990. Thirteen of these
units were no longer eligible because
they had stopped providing metha-
done treatment by 1995. Four units that
had begun providing methadone treat-
ment in the interim were added to the
1995 sample. Of the combined 131 eli-
gible units, 116 participated and 15 de-
clined to do so, a response rate of 89%.
Analyses showed no evidence of non-
response bias due to units that dropped
out from the study from 1988 to 1990
or from 1990 to 1995.16
For the 2000 data collection, we con-
tacted the 116 participating units from
1995, and of these, 112 agreed to par-
ticipate, a 97% response rate. In addi-
tion, we added 47 new methadone units
to the 2000 sample. These units were se-
lected at random from among metha-
done programs that had begun since
1988. The purpose of adding this sub-
sample to the panel units was to ensure
that the 2000 cross-section as a whole
was representative of the population of
methadone treatment units; the panel
sample alone would not have repre-
sented these newer units. The response
rate among these new sample units was
81% (n=38). To determine if these new
sample units had a significantly differ-
ent relationship with the study's depen-
dent variables than the panel units, we
entered a control variable into the re-
gression analyses. This control for new
sample units was not significant in any
equations, and we dropped it in the re-
sults reported herein. Thus, the total
sample for 2000 was 150 units, with a
combined response rate of 92%.
Data Collection
The unit director and supervisor of
clinical services of each participating
unit completed telephone surveys. The
survey team followed established meth-
odologies shown in previous research
to maximize data reliability and valid-
ity in telephone surveys.30 Respon-
dents received a worksheet in advance
of our call that informed them of the
requested data. This enabled respon-
dents to consult financial and admin-
istrative records prior to the call. The
survey team conducted dozens of in-
ternal consistency checks as soon as the
data were collected.
Measures
Methadone Treatment Practices. Us-
ing data from clinical supervisors, we
calculated the percentage of patients in
each treatment unit who received dos-
ages that were below 40, 60, or 80 mg/d.
Thesemeasureswerecalculatedonlyfor
patients who had been receiving the
same methadone dose for at least 2
weeks. They therefore measure the dose
level that units dispense for patients
whose dose levels have stabilized.
Patient Characteristics. Clinical su-
pervisors reported 4 important char-
acteristics of patient mix that could be
correlated with methadone treatment
practices: employment status (percent-
age of patients who are currently un-
employed), race/ethnicity (percent-
age of African American and Hispanic/
Latino patients), sex (percentage of
male patients), and average patient age.
All of these measures are characteris-
tics of the mix of patients at the unit
level of analysis; we do not have data
from individual patients.
Unit Characteristics. We measured
several organizational characteristics
that could relate to variation in treat-
ment practices.16,18 Clinical supervi-
sors reported the percentage of staff
members who are ex-addicts. Direc-
tors reported unit ownership (public,
private for-profit, or private not-for-
profit; we used private not-for-profit as
the referent category). Finally, given re-
cent efforts to improve the quality of
methadone treatment through accredi-
tation, we used data from the unit di-
rector to measure JCAHO accredita-
tion (1=yes; 0=no).
Geographic Location and Time Ef-
fects. Previous research suggests im-
portant geographic variation in metha-
done treatment practices.16,18 We
measured geographic location using a
census division scale (Northeast, Mid-
west, South, and West) with the North-
east region serving as the referent cat-
egory. To capture time effects, we
created dummy variables correspond-
ing to the year in which survey data
were collected, with 1988 serving as the
referent year.
Data Analysis
This study uses a longitudinal, panel de-
sign. This design is most effective for
examining changes in treatment prac-
tices over time. Panel data analysis is
complicated, however, by unobserved

unit heterogeneity and by potential
nonresponse bias.31-33 Methadone doses
within the same treatment units are
likely to be correlated over time due to
unobserved characteristics of these
same units. Standard linear and logis-
tic regression models, which assume in-
dependence among observations, must
be modified for panel data analyses.
Nonrandom attrition may also bias sub-
sequent results.
To address these concerns, we ana-
lyzed the data using a random-effects
specification that accounts for repeated
measuresovertime.16,31 Foreachdepen-
dent variable, a random-effects model
uses all data from the 4 waves simulta-
neously,butallowsforthepossibilityof
random unit effects. Explanatory vari-
ables included patient characteristics,
unit characteristics, environmental fac-
tors, and 3 dummy variables to model
changesintheoutcomevariablesacross
1988, 1990, 1995, and 2000.
Random-effects models are also help-
ful to mitigate bias due to nonrandom
attrition over time.32,33 In the presence
of attrition, naive analysis using only
the data from units that participated in
all 4 surveys can produce biased re-
sults.33 All available data from the 4 sur-
veys were used, including data from
those units that did not participate in
1990, 1995, or 2000.
A related advantage of random-
effects models is that they help to
address effects due to unobserved unit
heterogeneity.Thoughwemeasureunit
characteristics in our multivariate
model,wedidnotmeasuresomeimpor-
tant characteristics, such as features of
local drug markets and the attitudes of
specific payers, managers, patients, and
treatment staff. Because these unmea-
sured characteristics are rather stable
overtime,andbecausewewishtoexam-
ine the impact of observed unit char-
acteristicssuchaspatientmix,ourbase-
line model is the random-effects
regression specification estimated by
D'Aunno et al.16
Finally, because this random-effects
specification relies on important statis-
tical assumptions, we also estimated a
more restrictive fixed-effects model and
compared the 2 models using a Haus-
man test. This procedure compared our
random-effects results with a fixed-
effects model that allowed for the pos-
sibility that unit characteristics that we
did not measure (eg, staff training) are
correlated with the observed covari-
ates. When the random-effects model is
correctly specified, the fixed-effects es-
timator yields consistent (though inef-
ficient) point estimates for all time-
varying covariates. If point estimates
from the 2 models yield statistically sig-
nificant differences, unobserved hetero-
geneity may bias the random-effects co-
efficients. Analyses were performed
using Stata 6.0 (Stata Corp, College
Station, Tex) and P.05 was the level
of significance.
RESULTS
TABLE 1 shows mean methadone dos-
ages by year within the study sample. A
substantial decline was observed be-
tween 1995 and 2000 in the prevalence
of low doses. By 2000, 64.5% of metha-
done patients received dosages that ex-
ceeded 60 mg/d, the minimum recom-
mendedbytheInstituteofMedicineand
by consensus panels. Among those pa-
tients receiving dosages below this
threshold, most received doses be-
tween 40 and 60 mg/d. However, 13.2%
of all methadone patients continued to
receive less than 40 mg/d. Only 7.9% of
methadone units reported maximum
methadone dose levels below Institute
of Medicine guidelines. Although these
trends indicate increasing provider ad-
herence to the dose levels recom-
mended by consensus panels, few
methadonepatientsappeartoreceiveop-
timal doses as indicated by recent re-
search. Only 32.4% of patients receive
more than 80 mg/d, the range marked
as optimal by Strain et al.17
Multivariate Analysis of Trends
TABLE 2 shows the results of our ran-
dom-effects regressions. Controlling for
unit characteristics, our regressions
confirm the trends indicated by Table
1. Compared with the 1988 baseline,
the percentage of patients receiving dos-
ages below 40 mg/d declined by 30.20
percentage points by the year 2000. The
percentage of patients below 60 mg/d
dropped by more than 42 percentage
points. The percentage of patients re-
ceiving dosages below 80 mg/d de-
clined more slowly, but still declined
by more than 25 percentage points. All
of these trend results were significant
(P.001).
As in previous analyses,16 units with
a greater percentage of African Ameri-
can patients were especially likely to dis-
pense low doses. Each percentage point
increase in the proportion of African
American patients was associated with
a 0.27 percentage point increase in the
proportion of patients receiving doses
below the 60 mg recommended mini-
mum. No statistically or clinically sig-
nificantdifferenceswereobservedbypa-
tients' Hispanic/Latino status.
Other unit characteristics were also
correlated with methadone dose. Units
with a smaller number of methadone
patients were more likely to dispense
low doses. Facilities with JCAHO ac-
creditation were less likely to provide
low doses.
No differences were observed by for-
profit status or by public ownership sta-
tus. Units with high percentages of un-
employed patients were less likely than
other units to provide low dosages. The
percentage of ex-addicts among unit
staffs was not associated with signifi-
cant differences in methadone dosage.
Although our statistical model in-
cludes several variables to capture treat-

ment practices and case mix of specific
units,thevariablesincludedinourmodel
may be correlated with unit character-
istics that we did not measure, such as
staff training, that may influence metha-
done dose levels. We examined this pos-
sibility by estimating a fixed-effects
model. When we compare the 2 mod-
els, we find nearly identical results for
yearly trends and for the estimated ef-
fects of number of methadone patients.
The effect of African American case
mix is also smaller (though less pre-
cisely measured) in the fixed-effects
specification. These results suggest that
units that treat a large proportion of Af-
rican American patients have charac-
teristics associated with lower doses.
For example, perhaps counselors in
units that treat a high percentage of Af-
rican American patients are not trained
adequately about proper dose levels. Or,
perhaps there is more turnover of staff
members in such units that prevents
them from establishing relationships
with patients that would support higher
doses.
A Hausman test formally supports
these possible explanations. This pro-
cedure rejects the similarity of the 2
models (P.004), indicating that unit
characteristics that we did not mea-
sure are correlated with observed co-
variates in our model. Comparing spe-
cific point estimates, we find quite
similar year effects in the fixed-effects
and random-effects specifications. In
our fixed-effects specification, we found
that private for-profit status was asso-
ciated with lower doses. We also found
weaker effects for JCAHO accredita-
tion, supporting the interpretation that
units with more effective practices
have self-selected into the JCAHO-
accredited group.
Results of Multivariate Analysis
of 2000 Survey Data
Because current variations in metha-
done dosage practices are most
important for public policy, we also
examined the 2000 cross-section
(TABLE 3). Within this 2000 cross-
section, JCAHO accreditation dis-
played the largest correlation with
methadone dose. Patients in JCAHO-
accredited units were 10 percentage
points more likely to receive doses
above the minimum recommended
guidelines and were also significantly
more likely to receive dosages exceed-
ing 80 mg/d.
In additional analyses (data not
shown), we identified several other
variables correlated with methadone
dose. Units that predominantly serve
drug users younger than 30 years of
age or that rapidly seek to "detoxify"
patients from methadone were more
likely than other units to dispense
lower dosages. In addition, units
whose directors believed "strongly" or
"very strongly" in 12-step programs
were more likely to give dosages
below 40 mg/d.

COMMENT
Results from this panel study indicate
considerable progress in meeting con-
sensus guidelines for methadone treat-
ment. Two thirds of all patients now re-
ceive dosages above 60 mg/d. Treatment
practices in the year 2000 contrast
strongly with 1988, when 80% of pa-
tients received dosages below this level.
Despite these trends, only 32.4% of
patients are receiving dosages above 80
mg/d, the level indicated as optimal in
recentrandomizedtrials.Increasingdos-
age levels to 80 mg/d may be the most
pressing current issue, in light of re-
cent clinical evidence and in light of in-
creased heroin purity of street drugs. In
fact, the increase in dose levels we have
observed may reflect increased purity:
treatment providers may have in-
creased dosage in response to more se-
vere abuse or dependence among their
patients. Treatment providers may re-
main one step behind if they do not con-
tinue to increase dosages to the 80 mg/d
level. At a minimum, individuals who
have responsibility and authority for de-
termining dose levels should conduct a
review of policies and practices to en-
sure that dose levels are tailored to meet
the needs of individual patients.
We expect, however, that increas-
ing dosage levels to 80 mg/d will be dif-
ficult in many programs, especially
those that hold strong abstinence ori-
entation or those whose patients or staff
are otherwise ambivalent regarding the
clinical or values trade-offs inherent to
methadone use. It is also true that some
patients can do well on lower doses of
methadone; "more" is not always bet-
ter. Because this study did not collect
outcome data from patients, we are not
able to examine this possibility.
Further, some drug treatment pro-
fessionals and staff (and some pa-
tients) do not fully support the use of
methadone to treat heroin use disor-
ders. Others do not support the prin-
ciple that methadone is an appropri-
ate long-term solution to heroin
dependence or abuse. Perhaps these
programs should consider alternative
therapies such as buprenorphrine,
shown in clinical trials to be effective
when properly dispensed.34Alternative
medications do not carry the stigma as-
sociated with methadone, nor do they
carry the symbolic importance of
methadone within the drug treatment
community and broader society.
Another critical result is that units
that treat predominately African Ameri-
can patients continue to provide low
doses. Within-unit changes in the per-
centage of African American patients
had smaller association with dosage
than did comparisons across treat-
ment units with different proportions
of African American patients. This pat-
tern of results--indicated formally
through comparison of fixed-effects
and random-effects specifications--
indicates that these low doses reflect
characteristics of treatment programs
that are widely used by African Ameri-
can patients. It is possible that African
American patients are receiving treat-
ment at programs that have underly-
ing weaknesses in resources, includ-
ing funds and staff, that make them less
likely to keep up with best practices.
These programs are located dispropor-
tionately in urban settings that have dif-
ficulty attracting and retaining well-
educated and well-motivated staff
members. Further, these programs are

not likely to have funds to spend on
training or educational sessions that
could improve their practices.
These patterns are of special con-
cern, since adherence to methadone
dose recommendations may be corre-
lated with other aspects of the quality
of care. Further research on quality of
treatment available to African Ameri-
cans is warranted, especially in light of
the high HIV incidence and preva-
lence among African American injec-
tion drug users.
Finally, the results indicate that
JCAHO accreditation seems to play an
important role in adherence to consen-
sus guidelines. Because JCAHO does
not set explicit standards for metha-
done dose levels, we suspect that the
higher doses that accredited units give
to patients reflect some of their under-
lying characteristics. Specifically, one
possible reason that units with JCAHO
accreditation are more likely to pro-
vide higher methadone doses is that
such units have more adequate re-
sources overall, including staff and
funds for training.
Additional research is needed to
understand how JCAHO accreditation
affects conformity to consensus guide-
lines. But the relationship between
accreditationandadequatedosageprac-
tices may suggest directions for the
CSAT to pursue as it begins its regula-
tory control of the nation's methadone
treatment programs.
