Although abnormal glucose tolerance is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease, its relation to
cancer risk is less certain. Therefore, the authors performed a prospective cohort study using data from the
Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the Second National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey Mortality Study to determine this relation. This analysis focused upon a nationally
representative sample of 3,054 adults aged 30­74 years who underwent an oral glucose tolerance test at
baseline (1976­1980). Deaths were identified by searching national mortality files through 1992. Adults were
classified as having either previously diagnosed diabetes (n = 247), undiagnosed diabetes (n = 180), impaired
glucose tolerance (n = 477), or normal glucose tolerance (n = 2250). There were 195 cancer deaths during 40,024
person-years of follow-up. Compared with those having normal glucose tolerance, adults with impaired glucose
tolerance had the greatest adjusted relative hazard of cancer mortality (relative hazard = 1.87, 95% confidence
interval (CI): 1.06, 3.31), followed by those with undiagnosed diabetes (relative hazard = 1.31, 95% CI: 0.48, 3.56)
and diabetes (relative hazard = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.49, 2.62). These data suggest that, in the United States, impaired
glucose tolerance is an independent predictor for cancer mortality.

Abnormal glucose tolerance is a well-established risk
factor for increased all-cause mortality and cardiovascular
disease mortality (1­3). Less well appreciated is growing
evidence that abnormal glucose tolerance may predict an
increased risk of cancer (4­6). Possible mechanisms include
adiposity-related hormonal effects (7­9), dietary carcino-
genesis associated with diets high in fats and energy (10­12),
hyperlipidema (13), and dysregulation of cell growth related
to high levels of insulin (11, 14­16) and insulin-like growth
factors (17­24). Results from previous epidemiologic
studies of the association of abnormal glucose tolerance and
cancer are mixed (1, 4­6, 25­32). A few positive studies
have reported relative risks ranging from 1.5 to 8.0 related to
impaired glucose tolerance (4­6, 28). However, the majority
of studies have reported no associations (1, 25, 27, 29­32).
Methodological limitations that may account for the vari-
ability in prior studies include the nonstandard oral glucose
tolerance test (28, 32), failure to control for obesity (31),
samples not typical of the general US population (1, 4, 6, 25­
27, 30, 32), and lack of attention to impaired glucose toler-
ance as a category distinct from undiagnosed or diagnosed
diabetes (1, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32).
Therefore, to determine if abnormal glucose tolerance
predicts cancer mortality in the general US population, we
analyzed data from the Second National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES II) Mortality Study

with the following two objectives: first, to compare cancer
mortality among individuals with diagnosed type 2 diabetes,
undiagnosed diabetes, and impaired glucose tolerance with
that among individuals who had normal glucose tolerance;
and second, to determine whether excess cancer mortality in
adults with abnormal glucose tolerance is independent of
adiposity and other potential cancer risk factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data source
Data were taken from the NHANES II Mortality Study, a
prospective cohort study that passively followed participants
over 30 years of age who underwent a detailed physical
examination in NHANES II (n = 9,250). NHANES II was
conducted between 1976 and 1980 by the National Center
for Health Statistics. A stratified, multistage sample design
was used to produce a representative sample of the noninsti-
tutionalized US civilian population between the ages of 6
months and 74 years (33). The survey included a physical
examination, laboratory tests, and questionnaires on health
and nutrition-related topics. The response rate for adults
aged 20­74 years selected for the examination was 68
percent (34).
Participants
Of the NHANES II participants, half the adults aged 30­
74 years (n = 4,664) were selected at random and asked to
undergo an oral glucose tolerance test. Individuals were
excluded from analysis if they attended the afternoon exam-
ination session (n = 14), had a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance
test duration of less than 105 minutes or greater than 135
minutes (n = 2), had a missing 2-hour blood glucose value
(n = 1,402), or reported race as "other" (i.e., neither White
nor African American) (n = 62). Participants who had type 1
diabetes (age of diagnosis < 30 years and current insulin use;
n = 10) were also excluded. Thus, the analysis sample
included 3,174 White or African-American adults with
known glucose tolerance status. For the mortality and
proportional hazards analysis, participants with a history of
cancer at baseline (n = 162) were excluded, and participants
with missing values for blood pressure, high density lipopro-
tein cholesterol, education, smoking, or physical activity
(n = 306) were excluded from the multivariate analysis.
Glucose tolerance classification
Glucose tolerance was classified according to 1985 World
Health Organization criteria (33). These criteria were chosen
because they were in wide use at the time of the baseline
examination and follow-up and because they had been
applied in most studies of glucose tolerance in NHANES II
(34). After a fasting blood sample was taken, participants
ingested 75 g of glucose (33). Subsequent blood samples
were taken at 120 minutes postchallenge, within 15 minutes
of specified times. Participants were classified as having
previously diagnosed diabetes (n = 248) if they answered
"yes" to both of the following questions: "Do you have sugar
diabetes?" and "Did a doctor tell you that you had it?"; they
were classified as having undiagnosed diabetes (n = 183) if
their fasting plasma glucose level was greater than or equal
to 140 mg/dl or if their 2-hour plasma glucose level was
greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl. Participants were classi-
fied as having impaired glucose tolerance if their 2-hour
plasma glucose level was between 140 mg/dl and 199 mg/dl
and their fasting plasma glucose level was less than 140 mg/
dl (n = 480). All other participants were classified as having
normal glucose tolerance (n = 2,263).
Baseline assessments
Information on age at interview, sex, race, years of educa-
tion (less than high school, high school or greater), and
personal health characteristics was obtained by interview.
Cigarette smoking status was categorized as current, past, or
never. Alcohol intake was categorized as zero drinks per
week, 1­2 drinks per week, or three or more drinks per week.
Participants were asked to rate both their own recreational
and nonrecreational physical activity as "much,"
"moderate," or "little to no activity." Responses for both
types of physical activity questions were summed and
recoded to yield the following classification: 1 (high in one
and moderate in the other), 2 (moderate in both), 3 (moderate
in one and low in the other), and 4 (low activity in both).
There were no participants who reported high physical
activity in both categories. Participants were classified as
having a history of cancer if they answered "yes" to the
following question: "Has a doctor ever told you that you had
cancer?"
Height, measured using standardized bar, and weight,
measured using a balance bar scale, were used to calculate
the body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2) for each
participant. Using a mercury sphygmomanometer, a physi-
cian recorded each participant's resting blood pressure twice
in the sitting position. The average of the two blood pressure
(mmHg) readings for each participant was used in this study.
Laboratory measures, including standard blood assays for
serum total cholesterol, high density lipids, triglycerides, and
plasma glucose levels, were obtained after participants
fasted overnight for 10­16 hours (33, 35).
Outcomes
Mortality status was ascertained for the years 1976­1992
by searching the National Death Index and the Social Security
Administration Death Master File (36). There was no
censoring in this cohort; participants not found to be
deceased by December 31, 1992, were assumed to be alive.
Deaths were ascribed to cancer if cancer was coded as the
underlying cause of death on the death certificate (Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9),
codes 146.0­239.9). There were a total of 195 cancer deaths
in the oral glucose tolerance test group. In subsidiary anal-
yses of specific types of cancer, cancer deaths were subdi-
vided as follows: colon (ICD-9 codes 153.0­153.9), breast
(ICD-9 codes 174.0­175.9), prostate (ICD-9 codes 185.0­
185.9), lung (ICD-9 codes 162.0­162.9), and pancreas (ICD-
9 codes 157.0­157.9).

Analysis
Analyses were weighted to the US population using the
standard National Center for Health Statistics-derived
sample weights for the midpoint of NHANES II (March 1,
1978) and SUDAAN statistical software, version 6.4, to
account for the complex survey design and provide nation-
ally representative estimates (33, 37, 38).
Baseline comparisons by glucose tolerance groups for
demographics (age, sex, race, education) and behavioral
(physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake) and biologic
(total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, tri-
glycerides, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure,
body mass index, history of cancer at baseline) risk factors
were completed using analysis of variance or Pearson's 2
test. All tests of significance were two tailed, and no correc-
tions for multiple comparisons were made.
The weighted number of person-years was summed sepa-
rately for each glucose tolerance group. The weighted
number of deaths from cancer was also summed for each
group. Mortality was calculated for each group using these
weighted sums. The Poisson distribution was used to calcu-
late 95 percent confidence intervals (39).
Cumulative mortality was determined using a life-table
method (40). For each 5-year age group, the weighted popu-
lation based on age at death or at end of follow-up was calcu-
lated along with the weighted number of deaths from all
cancers and the specific cancers for each glucose tolerance
group. A life table was developed, and the probability of
mortality based on age was calculated. Cumulative mortality
was determined for all cancers and specific cancers and
plotted as cumulative mortality curves by glucose tolerance
group. Cumulative mortality curves were compared using
log-rank tests (39, 41).
Proportional hazard analyses (41) were performed to
determine whether the observed relative hazards could be
explained by other potentially confounding variables
including age, sex and race, education, behavioral risk
factors (physical activity and smoking), and biologic risk
factors (body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and high
density lipoprotein cholesterol). Graphs of the log-log plot of
the relative hazards by time were used to confirm the
assumption of proportional hazards. There were no signifi-
cant first-order interactions between glucose tolerance status
and any other covariate (all p values > 0.05).
Analysis was repeated using the 1998 World Health Orga-
nization criteria (42). On the basis of these criteria, partici-
pants were classified as having diagnosed diabetes (n = 248),
undiagnosed diabetes if the fasting glucose level was greater
than or equal to 126 mg/dl or if the 2-hour plasma glucose
level was greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl (n = 206),
impaired glucose tolerance if the fasting plasma glucose
level was less than 126 mg/dl and the 2-hour glucose level
was 140­200 mg/dl (n = 465), or impaired fasting glucose if
the fasting glucose level was greater than or equal to 110 mg/
dl and less than 126 mg/dl and the 2-hour glucose level was
less than 140 mg/dl (n = 71). Because of the small number of
participants with impaired fasting glucose and the small
number of deaths in this group, we combined the impaired
fasting glucose and the impaired glucose tolerance groups
into an abnormal glucose tolerance group. All other partici-
pants were classified as having normal glucose tolerance
(n = 2,184). To attempt to exclude participants who may
have had subclinical cancer prior to examination in
NHANES II, we also repeated the analysis excluding deaths
during the first 3 and 5 years of follow-up.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the cohort by
glucose tolerance status at baseline. Expected trends were
observed across the groups from normal glucose tolerance to
diagnosed diabetes. Specifically, compared with their counter-
parts who had normal glucose tolerance, those with abnormal
glucose tolerance were older and more likely to be female, less
educated, and sedentary. They also were less likely to be
current smokers or to drink one or more drinks per week
compared with those having normal glucose tolerance. Further,
they had greater adiposity, lower high density lipoprotein
cholesterol, higher total cholesterol and triglycerides, and
higher blood pressure. The reported history of cancer at base-
line was highest for participants with diagnosed diabetes, but it
was not statistically different compared with other groups.
All-cause mortality
As we previously reported, there were 737 deaths (23
percent) during 42,130 person-years of follow-up. The all-
cause death rate per 1,000 person-years was highest for the
diagnosed diabetes group at 40.9, followed by the undiagnosed
diabetes group at 33.2, the impaired glucose tolerance group at
20.8, and the normal glucose tolerance group at 10.6 (p for
trend < 0.001) (43). Likewise, cumulative all-cause mortality
was strongly associated with the glucose tolerance group,
rising from 20.3 percent in the normal glucose tolerance group
at age 70 years to 26.7 percent in the impaired glucose toler-
ance group, 33.9 percent in the undiagnosed diabetes group,
and 41.2 percent in the diagnosed diabetes group (overall log-
rank p < 0.001) (43) (detailed findings not presented).
Cancer mortality
Patterns of cancer mortality differed from all-cause
mortality. Of the 737 deaths, 206 (28 percent) were attribut-
able to cancer. The highest cancer death rate per 1,000
person-years was for the impaired glucose tolerance group at
8.1, followed by undiagnosed diabetes at 5.7, diagnosed
diabetes at 5.4, and the normal glucose tolerance group at 4.1
(table 2).
At age 70 years, the cumulative mortality for cancer was
highest for the impaired glucose tolerance group (12.4
percent), followed by the normal glucose tolerance group
(7.9 percent), undiagnosed diabetes (7.1 percent), and diag-
nosed diabetes (5.2 percent) (figure 1).
To determine whether the excess risk of mortality associ-
ated with abnormal glucose tolerance might be explained by
the presence of cancer risk factors or biologic factors that
commonly accompany diabetes and abnormal glucose toler-

ance, we constructed proportional hazards models. After
simultaneous adjustment for age, sex, race, education,
smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, body mass index,
systolic blood pressure, and high density lipoprotein choles-
terol, abnormal glucose tolerance remained strongly associ-
ated with cancer mortality. Compared with their counterparts
who had normal glucose tolerance, participants with
impaired glucose tolerance had a fully adjusted relative risk
for cancer mortality that was 1.87 times higher (table 3).

with diagnosed diabetes and a 1.31-fold increased risk for
participants with undiagnosed diabetes; however, neither
was statistically significant (table 3). We repeated the anal-
ysis excluding deaths during the first 3 and 5 years of follow-
up to determine if the increased cancer mortality was due to
undiagnosed or subclinical cancer at baseline. This did not

appreciably change the increased risk of cancer mortality for
participants with impaired glucose tolerance compared with
those who had normal glucose tolerance (table 3).
We repeated the analysis using the 1998 World Health
Organization definition for undiagnosed diabetes and
abnormal glucose tolerance. Similar trends were observed
for cancer mortality. Compared with those who had normal
glucose tolerance, the fully adjusted relative risk of cancer
death for participants with abnormal glucose tolerance was
1.53 (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 0.95, 3.13). This
increased risk was also observed for participants with undi-
agnosed diabetes (relative risk (RR) = 1.25, 95 percent CI:
0.50, 3.13) and diagnosed diabetes (RR = 1.19, 95 percent
CI: 0.51, 2.75).
Specific types of cancer
To determine if a specific type of cancer was primarily
responsible for increased cancer mortality in the impaired
glucose tolerance group, we compared specific cancers by
glucose tolerance group. The most commonly reported
cancer sites were the lung (n = 67), colon (n = 19), pancreas
(n = 13), breast (n = 9), and prostate (n = 10). Compared with
that of the participants who had normal glucose tolerance,
the relative hazard (adjusted for age, sex, and race) of colon
cancer mortality for participants with impaired glucose toler-
ance (n = 8) was 4.24 (95 percent CI: 1.25, 14.41).
Compared with that of the participants who had normal
glucose tolerance, the relative hazard (adjusted for age, sex,
and race) of lung cancer mortality for participants with
impaired glucose tolerance (n = 14) was 1.57 (95 percent CI:
0.70, 3.54). Participants with undiagnosed or diagnosed
diabetes did not appear to have an increased risk of cancer
mortality by specific cancer site. However, the small number
of events within each of these groups precludes us from
drawing any inferences (44).
DISCUSSION
These data suggest that, in the general US population,
impaired glucose tolerance is a strong predictor of death due
to cancer, particularly colon cancer. This association was
independent of adiposity, smoking, and a variety of other
potentially confounding factors. In contrast, for adults with
diabetes, whether undiagnosed or diagnosed, there was little
or no association with subsequent risk of cancer death. The
strengths of this study that lend weight to the conclusions
include a nationally representative sample, long follow-up,
and use of a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test.
Nonetheless, several limitations should be kept mind.
First, we cannot exclude the possibility that unsuspected
cancer at the time of baseline assessment led to abnormal
glucose tolerance (45­47). However, there was no appre-
ciable difference in mortality risk when deaths during the
first 5 years of follow-up were excluded. If preclinical cancer
were driving the results, one would expect the risk of cancer
mortality to decrease significantly when these deaths were
excluded. Second, there was nonresponse in NHANES II
and, in addition, people in nursing homes, long-term-care
hospitals, and prisons were not included. However, previous
investigation of nonresponse in the oral glucose tolerance
group revealed that respondents and nonrespondents did not
differ significantly in demographic or health-related charac-
teristics (34). Participants who completed and those who did
not complete the oral glucose tolerance test did not differ by
mortality experience: The all-cause death rate per 1,000
person-years for oral glucose tolerance test respondents was
17.3 (95 percent CI: 16.1, 18.7), and for oral glucose toler-
ance test nonrespondents, it was 18.0 (95 percent CI: 16.1,
20.2); the cancer mortality per 1,000 person-years for
respondents was 4.3 (95 percent CI: 3.8, 4.9), and for
nonrespondents, it was 5.0 (95 percent CI: 4.5, 5.6). Third,
there was also potential for misclassification of glucose
tolerance status at baseline. Previous studies have found that,
although day-to-day variation of glucose tolerance may
occur, these variations are not the result of changes in insulin
response and are similar to the variations found with other
biologic measurements such as cholesterol (48­50). If
misclassification occurred, it was likely to be nondifferential
and would therefore have produced a conservative bias. In
addition, only 6.7 percent of the impaired glucose tolerance
group who died had diabetes coded on their death certificates
(43). Fourth, because mortality follow-up was passive,
misclassification of vital status was possible. It is unknown
whether the validity of cancer recorded on death certificates
differs by diabetes status. However, autopsy studies have
found that the recording of deaths from cancer on death
certificates is highly accurate (51, 52). Previous studies indi-
cate that deaths may be underascertained in Blacks (36).
Insofar as Blacks were overrepresented in the abnormal
glucose tolerance groups, this may have produced an under-
estimate of the mortality risk. Finally, the small numbers of
specific cancer deaths limited the power for analyses by
cancer types, so relative hazards estimates for specific types
of cancer should be interpreted with caution (44).
Results from previous studies regarding abnormal glucose
tolerance and cancer risk are mixed. Of 13 prospective
cohort studies published since 1980 concerning glucose
tolerance and cancer, four examined only the increased risk
of incident cancer for people with diagnosed diabetes,
neglecting individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or
undiagnosed diabetes. Of those four studies, three found no
evidence of increased risk for incident cancer (29),
colorectal cancer mortality (31), or prostate cancer (30), and
one study (27) found a slightly increased risk of colorectal
cancer for women with diagnosed diabetes. Three studies
that combined participants with diagnosed diabetes and
undiagnosed diabetes into a single exposure category
reported that there was a slightly increased risk of cancer
mortality and, specifically, pancreatic cancer (25, 26, 32).
Of the six prospective studies examining the association of
abnormal glucose tolerance and cancer, five provide the
strongest evidence to date linking abnormal glucose toler-
ance and an increased risk of cancer (4­6, 28, 53). Stengard
et al. (53) did not find an association between abnormal
glucose tolerance and cancer; however, the study had less
than 5 years of follow-up. Levine et al. (28) examined
different plasma glucose categories after a 1-hour oral
glucose tolerance test and the risk of cancer in the Chicago
Heart Association Detection Project cohort. The relative risk

of cancer for participants with a 1-hour plasma glucose level
greater than 205 mg/dl was statistically significant for men
(RR = 1.47, 95 percent CI: 1.09, 1.99) but not for women
(RR = 1.08, 95 percent CI: 0.67, 1.72). Shaw et al. (5) pooled
data from three separate cohort studies from Mauritius, Fiji,
and Nauru to determine the association of known diabetes,
impaired fasting hyperglycemia, and isolated postchallenge
hyperglycemia with mortality in 9,179 adults. The relative
risk of cancer mortality was greatest for individuals with
isolated postchallenge hyperglycemia (RR = 8.0, 95 percent
CI: 3.6, 17.9). Individuals with diabetes did not have an
increased risk of cancer mortality. Schoen et al. (4)
conducted a nested case-control study using the Cardiovas-
cular Health Study cohort with a mean follow-up time for
cases and controls of 6.5 years. All participants underwent a
75-g oral glucose tolerance test at baseline, and exposure
categories were designated as normal glucose tolerance,
impaired glucose tolerance, and diabetes. Cases were
selected from participants who had incident colon cancer.
There was an increased risk of cancer for impaired glucose
tolerance and diabetes, although it was not statistically
significant. However, analysis of 2-hour glucose categories
by quartiles, excluding people with diabetes, found an
increased risk of cancer for the highest quartile compared
with the lowest of 2.4 (95 percent CI: 1.2, 4.7). In a prospec-
tive study of prostate cancer mortality, Gapstur et al. (6)
found that, compared with participants with a postload
plasma glucose level of less than 6.6 mmol/liter, those with
levels of 6.7­8.8 mmol/liter had a 1.64-fold (95 percent CI:
1.1, 2.6) increased risk.
The exact mechanism underlying the increased risk of
cancer mortality in general, and colorectal cancer mortality
in particular, for individuals with impaired glucose tolerance
is not clear. Previous studies have suggested that compensa-
tory hyperinsulinemia (4­6, 54) may promote carcinogen-
esis, since insulin has been shown to be an important growth
factor, especially for colonic epithelial cells. Impaired
glucose tolerance corresponds to increased insulin levels
(55). These increased insulin levels also correspond to
increased levels of growth factor and insulin-like growth
factor binding proteins and decreased levels of insulin-like
growth factors, all of which inhibits cell apoptosis (13, 17,
56). Impaired glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinemia also
correspond to increased adiposity, which has also been
linked to increased risk of cancer, especially for colon cancer
and endometrial and postmenopausal breast cancer in
women (4, 7­9, 57).
In light of these hypothesized mechanisms, why should
impaired glucose tolerance be more strongly related to
cancer death than diabetes itself? One possible explanation is
that, as individuals progress from impaired glucose tolerance
to diabetes, insulin levels decrease from the highest values
for individuals with impaired glucose tolerance to levels well
below normal for individuals with diabetes who have -cell
failure (55). However, since participants with diagnosed
diabetes in this study had type 2 diabetes, it less likely that
they had progressed to -cell failure and were more likely
insulin resistant. Another possible explanation is that of
competing causes of death, whereby individuals with
diabetes may be more likely to die from cardiovascular
disease than from cancer. A third is that diabetes offers some
type of protective effect as observed by De Giorgino et al.
(58), who observed that diabetes was associated with longer
survival rates for individuals with malignant tumors. This
observation, along with recent evidence that the vessels of
individuals with diabetes may impede neoplastic cell spread
and metastasis (59), may also explain the lower cancer
mortality observed in participants with undiagnosed and
diagnosed diabetes. Each of these observations may
contribute to the explanation of why a greater risk of cancer
mortality is observed for individuals with impaired glucose
tolerance than for individuals with diabetes.
There are three main implications of our study. First,
impaired glucose tolerance may identify individuals who are
at high risk of developing colon cancer to target for increased
participation in screening programs and for rational triage of
invasive or expensive screening. Second, individuals with
impaired glucose tolerance may also serve as a high-risk
group from which to recruit for cancer prevention trials.
Finally, although these results do not necessarily have impli-
cations for cancer prognosis, they do for cancer incidence
and etiology by identifying impaired glucose tolerance and
related physiologic determinants as potential mechanisms
and risk factors for cancer.
