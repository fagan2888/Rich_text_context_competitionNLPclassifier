Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women in
Western countries and in Taiwan.1,2 Accumulated evidence
suggests that the use of complementary and alternative medi-
cine (CAM) has become increasingly popular among cancer
patients.3-6 It is estimated that among breast cancer patients
70% to 80% in non-Asian countries7,8 and 35% in Taiwan
have used CAM therapy.9,10 CAM comprises a diverse set of
healing philosophies, therapies, and products. Moreover,
using CAM to help breast cancer patients relieve their dis-
comforts such as insomnia, hot flushes, cancer-related fatigue,
and other symptoms is winning greater acceptance.11,12
Acupuncture, one of the major components of traditional
Chinese medicine (TCM), has now been widely accepted as
a part of CAM therapy.13 Unlike TCM in the Western society,
which is defined as alternative medicine, TCM in Taiwan is a
government-recognized medical system parallel to modern
medicine with regulations and reimbursement by the National
Health System. There are 13 Chinese medicine hospitals and
3548 Chinese medicine clinics in Taiwan.14 Most large aca-
demic hospitals have also established Chinese medicine
departments. However, CAM and conventional medicine are
usually provided by different specialists and have not been
well integrated in most institutions.

Abstract
Background. Breast cancer patients may experience various symptoms that affect the quality of life significantly and they seek
complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). To meet the needs of patients, we developed an integrative outpatient
care program. Methods. This program provided CAM consultation and acupuncture for breast cancer patients at Taipei
Veterans General Hospital. The outcome measures included Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey
(SF-12) and patient satisfaction questionnaires on the first visit (baseline) and at 6 months. Results. Forty-five breast cancer
patients were enrolled. All patients completed the study. The median age was 53.3 (±8.3). The symptoms most often
experienced during previous cancer treatments were fatigue (35.6%), arthralgia (20%), nausea (6.7%), and insomnia (6.7%).
The symptoms most wished to be diminished by the patients were arthralgia (22.2%), insomnia (17.8%), and fatigue (15.6%).
Thirty-four patients (75.6%) had sought CAM therapy to reduce these symptoms. Fifteen patients (33.3%) received CAM
consultation only and 30 (66.7%) received acupuncture in addition. Sixteen patients completed at least 6 sessions of
acupuncture. No serious adverse effect was reported. In the SF-12 Questionnaire on all the patients, physical component
summary (PCS) was 49.6 (±5.6) at baseline and 44.9 (±7.6) at 6 months (P = .001); the mental component summary (MCS)
was 44.7 (±6.1) at baseline and 52.3 (±9.3) at 6 months (P < .001). For patients who had completed acupuncture, PCS was
49.2 (±4.9) at baseline and 41.4 (±7.6) at 6 months (P = .148); the MCS was 45.6 (±6.2) at baseline and 49.7 (±11) at 6
months (P = .07). Thirty-eight (84.4%) patients were satisfied with this program. Conclusions. Our results demonstrated that
an integrative outpatient care program of conventional and Chinese medicine is feasible. Most patients were satisfied with
this program and the quality of life was improved. It is important to conduct more research to build a model that integrates
CAM with conventional medicine in Taiwan.

344 Integrative Cancer Therapies 15(3)
There are 2 models by which integrative oncology may
be applied to cancer patients, namely, the expert-based
model and the patient-centered model.15 In the expert-
based model, a patient seeks medical care first from the
oncologists and is then referred to CAM therapists or vice
versa. In the patient-centered model, a patient chooses to
visit the oncologists/surgeons and CAM providers simul-
taneously. Most hospitals or medical centers, including
those in the Unites States and in Taiwan, adopt the first
model for integrative medical therapy. However, the
patient-centered model provides friendlier and less time-
consuming service for cancer patients. Thus, building a
one-step care model that provides CAM and mainstream
medicine in the same locale at the same time is essential
for establishing a patient-centered integrative therapy for
breast cancer patients.
In this article, we share our experience of developing an
integrative outpatient care program that provides consulta-
tion with surgeons as well as Chinese medicine physicians.
Patient satisfaction and quality of life were assessed.
Subjects and Methods
Study Design
The integrative outpatient care program provides consulta-
tion with a surgeon and a Chinese medicine physician
jointly regarding the use of CAM, TCM and drug-herb
interactions. (Figure 1) Patients may choose acupuncture
for the relief of their symptoms. A questionnaire regarding
their symptoms, use of CAM, and satisfaction was com-
pleted by the patients on the first visit and at 6 months.
Outcome measures included Medical Outcomes Study
12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) and patient sat-
isfaction questionnaire, which were completed by the
patients on the first visit and at 6 months.
Participants
The study protocol (2101070271C) was approved by the
institutional review board of Taipei Veterans General
Hospital. Recruitment took place between September 2010
and March 2011. Inclusion criteria were as follows: patients
who were diagnosed with breast cancer, aged 25 to 80 years
old, and had visited our hospital for integrative outpatient
care program. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, pace-
maker implantation, history of acute myocardial infarction,
non­breast cancer patients, depression, and patients taking
Chinese herbal medicine. Voluntary informed consents in
written form were obtained from all patients before enroll-
ment. There were 98 breast cancer patients who visited our
program, of whom 45 were enrolled.
Interventions
Breast cancer patient who visited the integrative outpatient
care program were interviewed by a surgeon and given edu-
cation materials on complementary/alternative medicine and
drug-herb interactions. Patients who were suffering from side
effects after surgery and adjuvant treatment had the option of
choosing acupuncture. This includes auricle acupuncture,
needle acupuncture and electrostimulation performed by a
certified Chinese Medicine physician. Acupoints were
selected according to the symptoms and the theory of Chinese
medicine. Patients with different symptoms were prescribed
different acupoints. For instance, the principle for selecting
acupoints was as follows: face: S7; shoulder: GB 21, LI 15,
SI 11; upper extremities: LI 11, LI 10, TW 5, LI 4; lower
extremities: SP 10, ST 36, SP 9, KI 7. Electro-stimulation
was applied as either electro-acupuncture (EA), transcutane-
ous nerve stimulation (TENS) or Silver Spike Point (SSP)
therapy. SSP as needle-free EAand has been shown to have a
similar analgesic effect to standard EA. Dense-Disperse fre-
quencies (2 and 100 Hz, alternatively) and waves in Silver
Spike Point (SSP) were applied to patients to prevent adap-
tion of nerves. A course was defined as six acupuncture ses-
sions and patients had acupuncture 2 to 3 times per week.
Outcome Measures
Outcome measures for quality of life included SF-12 and
patient satisfaction questionnaire obtained on the first visit
(baseline) and at 6 months.16
Statistics
The data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows Version
17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). The distribution and
frequency of each category of variables were examined by
chi-square tests. A P value of less than .05 was considered
statistically significant.

Results
Study Population
Forty-five breast cancer patients participated in the integra-
tive care program. All patients completed this program. The
median age was 53.3 (±8.3) years. Table 1 shows the
patients' characteristics.
Symptoms Presented at First Visit
The patients had filled out a questionnaire regarding their
symptoms, use of CAM, improvement, and satisfaction.
The symptoms most often experienced during previous can-
cer treatments were fatigue (35.6%), arthralgia (20%), nau-
sea (6.7%), and insomnia (6.7%). The symptoms most
wished to be diminished by the patients were arthralgia
(22.2%), insomnia (17.8%), and fatigue (15.6%). Thirty-
four patients (75.6%) had previously sought CAM therapy
to reduce these symptoms. The prior use of CAM was pre-
sented in Table 2. The most often used CAM methods were
health food (55.6%), folk herbal remedies (28.9%), mas-
sage and aromatherapy (11.1%), acupuncture (8.9%), and
energy healing (8.9%). Most health food was provided by
nonmedical institutions (42.2%). Most users (33.3%) of
health food took it 4 times per month (data not shown). The
primary aims for using CAM were to improve immunity
(17.8%), reduce side effects (13.3%), and reduce cancer
symptoms (13.3%).
Acupuncture
The reasons for attending the program were to treat insom-
nia (31.1%), pain relief (26.7%), and consultation (15.6%).
The patients were given treatments according to their needs,
including consultation, ear magnetic acupuncture, ear acu-
puncture, manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture, and
SSP. Fifteen patients (33.3%) received CAM consultation
only while 30 (66.7%) received acupuncture in addition to
consultation. Of the 30 who received acupuncture, 16
patients completed at least 6 sessions of acupuncture.
Fourteen patients did not complete the course of acupunc-
ture for the following reasons: adverse effects (14.3%), no
improvement (7.1%), change to Chinese herbal medicine
(7.1%), not willing to continue acupuncture (50.0%), and
distant metastasis (7.1%). No serious adverse side effect
was reported.
Satisfaction
As to the overall satisfaction with the integrative care pro-
gram, 39 (86.7%) and 38 (84.4%) patients were satisfied
with the program on the first visit and at 6 months. Thirty-
nine patients (86.7%) were willing to continue the integra-
tive care on the first visit and at 6 months. If new symptoms
were present, 40 patients (88.9%) were willing to receive
further treatment in the integrative care program on the first
visit and at 6 months. Forty (88.9%) patients would recom-
mend their family and other patients to the program at the
first visit while 39 (86.7%) would recommend family and
other patients at 6 months.
SF-12 Questionnaire Measurement
In the SF-12 Questionnaire measurement on all the patients,
physical component summary (PCS) was 49.6 (±5.6) at
baseline and 44.9 (±7.6) at 6 month (p=0.001); the mental
component summary (MCS) was 44.7 (±6.1) at baseline
and 52.3 (±9.3) at 6 month (P < .001). For the patients who
completed acupuncture, PCS was 49.2 (±4.9) at baseline
and 41.4 (±7.6) at 6 month (P = .148); the MCS was 45.6
(±6.2) at baseline and 49.7 (±11) at 6 months (P = .07)
(Table 3).
Discussion
In Western society, 5 to 7 steps are required for patients to
receive CAM therapy under the guidance of their attending
physicians. To our knowledge, this is the first one-step patient-
centered integrative care program involving surgeons and
TCM physicians for breast cancer patients in Taiwan. The
patients can consult with surgeons and receive treatment by
TCM physicians simultaneously in the same institution. The
joint consultation between surgeon and TCM physician has 2

advantages. The first is that it addresses the issue of the sur-
geon's objection to the use of CAM. Second, it enables TCM
physicians to better understand the patient's history and to
cooperate with surgeons in conventional cancer treatment.
It is noteworthy that the pattern of integrative cancer
therapy in Western society is quite different from those in
China and in Taiwan. In Western society, most CAM thera-
pies are paid for out of pocket17 while in China, TCM,
which accounts for 90% of CAM, is covered by govern-
ment insurance.18 Owing to the insurance coverage of dual
medical systems, namely, modern medicine and TCM, the
latter is not defined as CAM therapy in Taiwan. The most
striking difference is the concern of drug-herb interaction.
In Western society, more than 50% to 60% of CAM use is
prayer or mindfulness meditation and about 10% use herbal
products--suggesting the consideration of nonpharmaco-
logical approach to integrative oncology.3,19 In contrast,
more than 50% to 70% of patients in China and one-third in
Taiwan received co-prescriptions of Chinese herbs to treat
their breast cancer, with no awareness of potential herb-
drug interaction.9,10 There is evidence that many Chinese
herbal extracts might upregulate ER and HER2 gene
expression in vitro20,21 and interact with tamoxifen in vivo.22
This program did not include herbal medicine because
previous studies indicated that there may be drug-herb
interaction between herbal medicine and conventional ther-
apy whereas there is none between acupuncture and con-
ventional therapy. As the program went on, colleagues in
the hospital gradually accepted the integrative medicine and
began to refer their patients to the program. Consequently, a
new integrative care program that provides traditional
Chinese herbal medicine is in progress and will enroll more
patients.
The findings in our survey showed that most breast can-
cer patients experienced various symptoms caused by can-
cer or by cancer treatment. For most patients, the duration
between the completion of adjuvant chemo/radiation and
their joining this program is no more than three months.
There were only a few patients who were still undergoing
adjuvant chemo/radiation when entering the program. Most
of these patients have tried CAM to resolve these problems,
which is consistent with existing studies. To help these
patients, the program provides acupuncture in addition to
consultation. It is surprising that only 30 patients (66.7%)
out of 45 chose acupuncture; yet only 16 received up to 6
sessions of acupuncture. More than half of the patients did
not complete the whole course of acupuncture and none
dropped out due to severe side effects. In the study by Frisk

et al,23 on women with breast cancer and hot flushes, 19/26
(73.1%) patients completed 12 weeks electro-acpuncture to
improve health-related quality of life and sleep.23 In the
study by Hervik et al,24 59 women suffering from hot flashes
following breast cancer surgery and adjuvant treatment
(tamoxifen) were randomized to either 10 weeks of tradi-
tional Chinese acupuncture or sham acupuncture. All
patients completed the study. In the study of Liljegren
et al,25 84 patients were randomized to receive either true
acupuncture or control acupuncture twice a week for 5
weeks. Seventy-four (88.1%) patients were treated accord-
ing to the protocol. When compared with other studies, the
dropout rate for acupuncture is high in our study. This
implies that conventional medicine is still the major medi-
cal option for these patients. The patients did not seem to
like acupuncture as expected although acupuncture has
been practiced in Chinese society for thousands of years.
Previous studies show that the prevalence of acupuncture in
Taiwan is less than 10%.26 However, there were still 16
patients who went through the whole course and some of
them even continued to receive acupuncture up to 6 months.
This suggests that some patients may have benefited from
acupuncture.
Most patients were satisfied with the program. SF-12
showed improvement significantly at the end of study. Most
patients joined this program after they completed conven-
tional cancer treatment, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and
radiotherapy. There were various symptoms affecting their
SF-12 scores. The improvement of SF-12 might be the
result of this program. The SF-12 score of the group that
completed acupuncture did not show statistical signifi-
cance. This may be due to small sample size. However, we
observed a trend of improvement of MCS, although it was
not statistically significant. There are 2 limitations to the
acupuncture study. First, improvement in symptoms on the
SF-12 scores might be due to the natural progression of
recovery after aggressive treatment. Second, the sample
size is small. Patients with different symptoms were pre-
scribed with different acupoints. The number of patients
with the same symptom is too small to show differences.
Previous studies show that acupuncture is effective in
relieving nausea/vomiting, hot flush, and pain.13,23-25 In the
future, further large scale studies with comparisons to a
control group is warranted.
Breast cancer patients who visited the integrative outpa-
tient care program were interviewed by a surgeon and
given education materials on complementary/alternative
medicine and drug-herb interactions. However, the out-
come of the patient education was not collected. According
to our understanding, the patients will not use the specific
herbs that might interact with the drugs mentioned in our
education materials. For instance, herceptin may interact
with Radix Angelicae Sinensis, Rhizoma Chuanxiong,
Radix Rehmanniae Glutinosae Conquitae, Radix Paeoniae
Lactiflorae. Chemotherapy may interact with some food
supplements and herbs. Radiation may interact with anti-
oxidants and herbs.
Any specialist could be the physician for the clinic.
However, surgeons are the primary caregivers and play a
key role in adjuvant treatments for breast cancer patients in
Taiwan. A surgeon in the clinic would therefore be invalu-
able to this program to win the trust and acceptance of other
surgeons. This will reduce politics in the hospital and
increase patient referrals. As the program progressed, sev-
eral surgeons and other specialists became interested.
Although Chinese medicine is the traditional medicine
in Taiwan, the conventional (Western) medicine has been
the mainstream in the medical system for several decades.
Most medical centers have set up divisions of TCM.
However, Chinese and Western medicines have not been
integrated in most hospitals. This is because of the medical
education system, regulations, and health insurance cover-
age. This program is an innovative project designed to pro-
vide a patient-centered service and to improve cooperation
and mutual understanding of Chinese and Western medi-
cines. Most patients were satisfied with this integrative care
program and showed improvement in their quality of life.
Our results showed that this program is feasible. Cancer
patients often suffer from various problems that cannot be
relieved by conventional medicine. However, we should
conduct more research to clarify issues such as the indica-
tions and benefits of acupuncture, herb use, members of the
clinics, and the outcome of patient education. CAM is
increasingly becoming more relevant by relieving some
symptoms and improving quality of life. It is important to
conduct more research to build a model that integrates
CAM with conventional medicine in Taiwan.
