The creatinine correction approach has been used to estimate daily intake for contaminants whose primary route of elimination is through urine. This
method is challenged using the phthalate di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) as an example. An alternate prediction approach based on human
experimental metabolism and urinary excretion data on DEHP was developed. This alternate model was developed from urine measurements of four
metabolites of DEHP from two individuals partaking in different experiments, for up to 44 h after known exposures. Particular attention was paid to the
changing ratios of the metabolites over time: they took a certain form when exposure was in the ``near'' (the past few hours) versus the ``distant'' (24 h or
more) past. The creatinine correction approach was applied to measurements of the same four metabolites from 18 individuals in the National Health
And Nutrition Evaluation Survey (NHANES) 2003/2004. The alternate model was also applied to these individuals, and the results were compared.
Predictions using the two methods were similar or the creatinine correction predicted higher concentrations when the ratio suggested that the DEHP
exposure was ``near'' in time, but the alternate approach predicted intakes that were an order of magnitude higher when the ratios suggested that the
intake was ``distant''. As much as 25% of all NHANES measurements contain metabolites whose key ratio suggest that exposure was ``distant''.
Uncertainties notwithstanding, the analysis in this article suggests that the creatinine correction approach should be used cautiously for DEHP and
possibly other contaminants with similar exposure characteristics: rapid metabolism with metabolite urine elimination half-lives on the order of hours, and
exposure patterns that may not be continuous and ongoing.

Introduction
Creatinine is excreted from muscles and eliminated through
urination on an ongoing basis. Equations relating an
individual's age, sex, and race to total daily elimination of
creatinine have been developed (Cockcroft and Gault, 1976;
Mage et al., 2004, 2008). Therefore, the amount of creatinine
in a spot urine sample can be related back to a full daily
excretion of creatinine. If exposure to a contaminant is
continuous, perhaps on a daily basis if not frequently within
a day and the primary means of elimination of that
contaminant is through urine, the creatinine correction
approach can be used to estimate daily intake of that
contaminant. The premise is that, assuming steady state
exposure and urinary excretion, daily intakes equal daily
urinary eliminations. A ratio of a spot sample excretion of
creatinine and total daily excretion of creatinine should equal
the ratio of the spot sample excretion of the contaminant and
the total daily excretion of the contaminant. The purpose of
this study was to question this premise, as applied to the
phthalate, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP).
The creatinine correction approach has been used to
estimate intakes of a variety of contaminants. Biomonitoring
programs, such as the National Health and Nutrition
Evaluation Survey (NHANES) or the German Environ-
mental Surveys regularly measure creatinine in a urine
sample along with other target constituents. It has been used
for a variety of pesticides (Fenske et al., 2000; Mage et al.,
2004) and conservative (i.e., those that don not, or mostly
don not metabolize) contaminants such as perchlorate
(Blount et al., 2007). In the case of contaminants that
metabolize, such as phthalates or pesticides, it is most often
not the parent compound that is measured but rather the
metabolites. Numerous researchers have used the approach

applied to phthalate metabolites to estimate daily intakes of
parent phthalates (David, 2000; Kohn et al., 2000; Marsee
et al., 2006). These researchers base their estimate on the first
metabolite produced: the monoester phthalate metabolite.
In fact, parent phthalates are not measured in urine. The
formation of metabolites of phthalates is so rapid that the
parent phthalate is not expected to appear in urine, and a
second justification given is that both sampling and
laboratory equipment may be contaminated with the parent
phthalate. For DEHP, the first metabolite is mono-
(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), and it is this metabolite
that has been most often related to daily intakes using the
creatinine correction approach.
However, the creatinine correction approach is only as
valid as the key assumption of steady state intakes. To be
more precise, this approach is only as valid as an assumption
that excretions are steady over time. Such steadiness would
occur if intakes were steady and daily, but excretions might
also be reasonably consistent over time if the intakes occurred
less frequently, say once every 3 days, but the elimination in
urine was very slow, say with half-lives on the order of days.
In reality, and as discussed below in more detail, DEHP
metabolites are eliminated with half-lives on the order of
hours, not days. MEHP, for example, has a half-life that has
been measured at 5 h. Given this fact, one does not know if a
concentration of MEHP in urine resulted from an exposure
in the recent few hours, or if it was the result of a very high
exposure the previous day or two. Very little is known about
the day-to-day or within-day patterns of DEHP intake.
Wormuth et al. (2006) provide one of the few comprehensive
evaluations of intakes of phthalates based on model
calculations. Their approach is a ``forward'' approach to
estimating intakes. That is, they model intake of phthalates
through consumption of food, intake from consumer
products, inhalation, and dust/soil exposures based on
parent phthalate concentrations in these exposure media in
combination with contact rates. Their analysis encompasses
several phthalates for Europeans of several age ranges.
They found that exposures were highest for DEHP, at
between 1 and 5 mg/kg/day for children, teens, and adults.
Exposures were always higher for infants, getting above
10 mg/kg/day for DEHP. Ingestion of food dominated
for DEHP. There was much variability (the range from
minimal to maximal exposures within consumer groups
was about a factor of 100) and uncertainty in this exercise,
based primarily on the paucity of data on phthalates in
food or consumer products. Franco et al. (2007) conducted a
quantitative assessment using two forward modeling
approaches focusing on individual pathways of exposure,
similar to that conducted by Wormuth et al. (2006).
By one method, they arrived at a median total daily
intake of 5.6 mg/kg/day for DEHP, but by the other
method, they arrived at much lower median intake of
0.68 mg/kg/day.
One key aspect of both forward and backward approaches
is that they assume average, steady state behaviors. Average
behaviors are, in reality, a mix of typical behaviors, as well as
extremes at both ends. An average daily consumption rate of
a food, for example, could very easily arise from a meal of
that food one day and then no consumption for several days.
If phthalates are associated with the food, then this exposure
could result in elevated concentrations of metabolites in the
urine for several hours after the exposure, but much smaller
to trace concentrations in the days following. The potential
issue with use of the creatinine correction approach is now
apparent F a low concentration could mistakenly imply a
low daily intake when in reality a large intake may have
caused the low concentration.
The problem becomes more exaggerated as the rate of
elimination increases F when elimination occurs much
more rapidly. The elimination half-life of MEHP has been
reported as 5 h in a human metabolism experiment
(Koch et al., 2005b), so that 24 h after exposure, five half-
lives have passed, and only about 3% of the total mass
of MEHP that was formed by the exposure remains to be
eliminated. It is easy to see that a day following an exposure
to DEHP, the concentration of MEHP could be very low or
fall below a detection limit. Meanwhile, secondary metabo-
lites could be still forming if their rate of formation and
excretion is slower than that of MEHP. Koch et al. (2005b)
measured four additional metabolites of DEHP in the
experiment, and found that these secondary metabolites of
DEHP have elimination half-lives in the range of 10­15 h.
This implies that MEHP might be a poor candidate as an
indication of exposure to DEHP. Indeed, Barr et al. (2003)
advocated the urinary analysis of secondary metabolites of
phthalates as perhaps better indicators of exposure, com-
pared with the monoester primary phthalate metabolites, for
just this reason. The NHANES program now measures for
more than just MEHP, the primary metabolite of DEHP.
Starting with NHANES 2001/2002, three secondary and
tertiary metabolites of DEHP were measured and four
metabolites from NHANES 2003/2004 (MEHP plus three
secondary metabolites) were used in this study.
This article explores the possibility that a relationship
between a tertiary and a secondary metabolite of DEHP in
urine can shed light on the timing and magnitude of exposure
to DEHP. Experimental data were obtained from two
individuals: one who self-dosed and one whose exposure
was through an apheresis blood platelet donation procedure.
Both exposures were substantially elevated above back-
ground (see discussions below). The exposures were halted
and then urine was collected and analyzed for five primary
DEHP metabolites for up to 48 h after the exposure. Initial
high concentrations of DEHP metabolites in urine declined
rapidly over the 24 h following exposure. Urine samples were
taken up to 24 h after the apheresis procedure ended and 44 h
after the self-dosed exposure. These data show not only

declines over time, but also changes in the relationships of
metabolites to each other. It is this trend of changing
relationships that is exploited in the draft model developed in
this study.
The simple model proposed in this study, which is not
considered mature enough for general usage, is based on the
experimental data from these two individuals. Specifically a
concentration ratio between a tertiary and a secondary
metabolite is developed. When this ratio is near 1.0, the
hypothesis is that exposure was recent, for example within the
past few hours. However, when this ratio is greater than 1.0,
in the range of 1.5­2.0 and higher, the hypothesis is that
exposure occurred several hours earlier, greater than 10 h or
even the previous day. Individual measurements of DEHP
metabolites in urine are retrieved from the NHANES 2003/
2004 database. Subsequently, assuming these profiles of
DEHP metabolites each arose from a single exposure (and
this assumption is explored in the discussion section later),
the ratio of the secondary metabolites informs as to whether
the exposure was ``near'' in time to the measurement or
``distant'' in time from the measurement. Then, the proposed
model (with a differing coefficient based on the ``near'' or
``distant'' judgment) is used to estimate the single dose, which
may have produced the measurement. Concurrently, the
NHANES measurements, including pertinent demographic
data, are used in the creatinine correction model to estimate
intakes. The two sets of estimates are compared, and
important differences are observed. As inferred from the
discussions above, when the exposure was in the ``distant'' past,
the creatinine correction approach estimated much less of a daily
intake, by factors of 10 or more, as compared with the alternate
approach. When the exposure was ``near'', both methods
estimated comparable intakes, and in fact, the creatinine
correction approach estimated higher intakes in some cases.
Materials and methods
Following an exposure to DEHP, the first metabolite generated
is the monoester metabolite, MEHP. Numerous secondary and
tertiary metabolites are generated, but four others have
been measured in urine: mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phth-
alate (5oxo-MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phtha-
late (5OH-MEHP), mono ((2-carboxymethy)hexyl) phthalate
(2cx-MMHP), and mono (2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate,
(5cx-MEPP). This study focuses on four of the five metabolites:
MEHP, 5oxo-MEHP, 5OH-MEHP, and 5cx-MEPP. The
estimated elimination half-lives (in hours) and percentage
of total dose that appears in urine after 24 h for the five
metabolites are (Koch et al., 2005b): 5h and 5.9% for MEHP,
10 h and 23.3% for 5OH-MEHP, 10h and 15.0% for 5oxo-
MEHP, 15h and 18.5% for 5cx-MEPP, and 424 h and 4.2%
for 2xc-MMHP. Excretions of the four metabolites studied in
this study explain about 63% of the initial intake of DEHP;
2cx-MMHP (the metabolite not researched here) explains only
about 4% of the total intake. The tertiary metabolite,
5cx-MEPP, has the longest half-life, and is the second most
dominant metabolite with regard to how much of the
initial molar dose it explains. The secondary metabolite,
5OH-MEHP, is the highest at 23.3% with 5cx-MEPP next
at 18.5%. What these facts translates to, in practical terms and
for purposes in this study, is that while other metabolites are
forming and being excreted at a more rapid pace than 5cx-
MEPP, it is this tertiary metabolite that eventually dominates
the profile of a urine sample of DEHP metabolites. Assuming
no other exposure to DEHP occurs, the data below show that,
initially after exposure, 5OH-MEHP is the metabolite with the
highest concentration. After about 10 h or so, 5cx-MEPP
becomes the metabolite with the highest concentration, and
remains as such, as the intake of DEHP is being depleted over
the 48h or so after exposure ceases. In other words, initially
after exposure, the ratio of 5cx-MEPP to 5OH-MEHP in a
spot urine sample is less than 1.0, but after 10 h or so, this ratio
exceeds 1.0. The ratio of 5cx-MEPP to 5OH-MEHP in a spot
urine sample will be the indicator used below in the model to
indicate whether the exposure was in the ``near'' or ``distant'' past.
Experimental data were retrieved for two individuals,
including an individual who self-dosed at an amount
significantly higher than typical background exposures and
an individual whose elevated exposure was due to an
apheresis blood platelet donation procedure. The Supple-
mentary Material includes data on three other individuals
who fasted. As the data and discussion will show, key trends
in these fasting individuals mirror those of these two highly
dosed individuals. Following is a summary of the experi-
mental data for the two highly dosed individuals. A listing of
the detailed data for these individuals is provided in the
Supplementary Material to this article.
Self-dosed Individual
This individual, 61 years old and having 75 kg body weight,
self-dosed an amount of 48.5 mg DEHP by consuming a
piece of buttered toast into which stable-isotope-labeled
DEHP was mixed. Concentrations of five metabolites of
DEHP in his urine were measured over the next 44 h.
The experiment was described in Koch et al. (2004, 2005b).
On a body weight basis, this 48.5 mg translates to 650 mg/kg.
This differs from median intakes determined from urine
measurements and the creatinine correction approach that
ranges from about 1 mg/kg/day in the United States (Lorber
et al., 2010) to 5 mg/kg/day based on urine measurements
from German study participants (Wittassek et al., 2007b).
As observed, this dose is clearly elevated above background
and this is observed also in the urine concentration data.
For example, concentrations of MEHP in the first several
samples from this individual (through about 10 h) ranged
from 1000­4000 mg/l. This differs from median background
population of MEHP concentrations of about 10 mg/l

and less (Wittassek et al., 2007b; CDC, 2009). Initially,
5OH-MEHP was higher than 5cx-MEPP by 1000­2000 mg/l;
both were in the 5000­10,000 mg/l range. At about 10 h post
exposure, both were below 5000 mg/l, and 5cx-MEPP was
consistently higher in concentration than 5OH-MEHP, and
the highest of all metabolites for the remainder of the 44 h of
measurements. All metabolites declined to below 100 mg/l by
the end of the 44 h.
Apheresis Platelet Donation Individual
This male individual, aged 35 years having 83 kg body
weight, underwent a dual-needle continuous flow platelet
apheresis procedure, which involved use of components
(tubings, bags, catheters, etc.) containing PVC plasticized
with DEHP. Details of the procedure and the measurement
of five DEHP metabolites in this individual's urine up to 24 h
after exposure are described in Koch et al. (2005a, c).
Concentrations of the four metabolites considered in this
article peaked at 4 h after the end of the procedure at
388, 822, 729, and 577 mg/l for MEHP, 5OH-MEHP,
5oxo-MEHP, and 5cx-MEPP, respectively. Note that the
concentration of 5cx-MEPP is less than that of 5OH-MEHP
for this measurement. After about 8 h, the 5cx-MEPP
concentration was the highest of all metabolites, and it
remained that way for all remaining urination events.
Concentrations of all metabolites were under 200 mg/l after
about 12 h and under 65 mg/l after 24 h. On the basis of total
mass excreted (i.e., not based on creatinine), Koch et al.
(2005c) estimated that the dose of DEHP received by this
individual was 2.6 mg, or about 31 mg/kg. It is noteworthy
that, like the self-dosed individual, the dose and measured
urine concentrations, were higher than typical background
exposures several hours after the exposure.
Figures 1 displays the change in this key ratio, the
concentration of the tertiary metabolite 5cx-MEPP to the
secondary metabolite 5OH-MEHP, over time following
cessation of the exposure, for these two individuals. The
key trend to note is that this ratio increases throughout most
of the experiment. For the self-dosed individual with 2 days
of urinations, the ratio continued to rise well into the second
day, staying over 2 and once above 3, until the last two
events at hours 43 and 44. These last two urination events
show a ratio more like 1.5 and could have been the result
of the individual's metabolism or some other phenomena. As
the DEHP was labeled for this self-dosed individual, the
measured metabolites were uniquely identified and the
concentrations are known to be the result of the experimental
intake. The ratios of the apheresis individual rise continually,
with a peak at about 1.85 at the end of the 24-h urine
collection period. The benefit of these experiments at high
doses is that the trends observed are mostly not influenced by
background exposures, and one could surmise that they
represent what would happen with any single background
dose at a much lower level. This assumes, of course, that the
metabolism and disposition of a background intake is
reasonably analogous to that of the high self-imposed
and apheresis intakes. If a background dose of phthalate
occurs as the result of an inhalation exposure, a skin-
applied cosmetic or a time-release pharmaceutical, then the
trends in urine concentrations might be different compared with
an oral dose or a dose directly delivered to the blood stream.
The data from the two highly exposed individuals will be
used in the general model developed in this study and used
along with the creatinine correction approach to estimate
intakes. On the basis of an examination of the ratios, three
``conditions'' after exposure are defined, with the first being
shortly after exposure when the ratios are near 1.0, the
second reflecting a ratio of about 1.5, which would occur 8­
16 h after exposure, and the last, when the ratio is above 2,
which might reflect an exposure 24 h or more after exposure.
For each condition, a simple ``multiplier'' is developed,
which relates the concentration of 5OH-MEHP in urine to
the intake dose, as:
MULTi
¼ DOSE=C5OHi
ð1Þ
where MULTi
¼multiplier for condition i; DOSE ¼
intake dose of DEHP, mg; 48.5 mg for the self-dosed
individual, and 2.6 mg for the apheresis patient; C5OHi
¼
representative concentration of 5OH-MEHP in urine during
condition i, mg/l.
With the units of MULTi
in ``l'' (liter), a multiplication of
this value by a urine concentration of 5OH-MEHP expressed
with a denominator in liters as well (mg/l, mg/l, etc.) will give
the single event dose of DEHP in mass consistent with the
mass unit of the 5OH-MEHP concentration (mg, mg). This
dose can be divided by the individual's body weight to
provide a single event dose on a body weight basis, such as
mg/kg body weight.
A few caveats in this study are noted before assigning
values of the MULT, based on the three conditions and the

two individuals. First, this approach importantly assumes
that the urine profile of DEHP metabolites resulted from a
single exposure in the past, and is not the result of many
ongoing intakes. As the MULT values are based on a single
dose from the two individuals, this same scenario is assumed
in application of the MULT values. This is obviously a
critical but not unreasonable assumption. Certainly if dietary
exposures are the primary exposures for DEHP, then a dose
during a given meal might be the only dose received that day.
With elimination half-lives on the order of hours (5­15 h),
metabolites from a given exposure are largely excreted within
a 24-h period. Certainly, at background ongoing exposures
there could be exposures other than those received at a single
meal, there could be some delayed metabolism, and other
factors that explain a given profile of metabolites. Second,
there is no specific reason that the concentration used in Eq.
(1) is that of 5OH-MEHP, although benefits to 5OH-MEHP
are that it is typically among the highest concentrations in a
profile of DEHP metabolites, it is not the first metabolite
formed, and it is consistently quantified. In conclusion, it is
assumed that the patterns of metabolism in the highly dosed
individuals, and in particular the changing ratios over time,
are similar to those experienced in the background popula-
tion even though individual episodes of exposure in the
general population are likely to be much less than in these
two conditions.
With that as backdrop, urine events are now selected from
the two individuals to develop the values of MULT
corresponding to three conditions: condition ``1'': Near the
time of exposure, ratio near 1.0; condition ``2'': eight or more
hours after exposure, ratio near 1.5; and condition ``3'': 20 h
or more after exposure, ratio near or greater than 2.0. These
``near'', ``intermediate'', and ``far in time'' conditions were
chosen based on best judgment and an examination of the
trends seen in Figure 1. Table 1 has the selection of these
events. Three events are selected from the data on the
apheresis patient, the last being the last event measured at
23.5 h, when the ratio of 5cx-MEPP to 5OH-MEHP was
1.85. The self-dosed individual tended to have many more
urination events (and lower volume per event) than the
apheresis patient F 14 over the first 24 h compared with
6 for the apheresis patient. For this reason, clusters of three
events representing each condition were selected to generate
the MULT values for this individual. The total mass of each
metabolite was summed and divided by the total urine
volume over those three events to get the concentrations
observed in Table 1. It is importantly noted that the middle
condition, when the ratio of 5cx-MEPP to 5OH-MEHP is
about 1.5, comes at a later time for the self-dosed individual
as compared with the apheresis individual. This could have
been the result of the self-dosed individual's age F he was 61
at the time of the experiment compared with 35 for the
apheresis patient. His metabolism may have been slower. The
route of exposure F oral for the 61 year old, who self-dosed
versus intravenous for the 35-year-old apheresis patient F
could also have made a difference in metabolism patterns. In
any case, concentrations had declined a lot more (relatively
speaking) at hours 13­18 for the self-dosed individual as
compared with 7.7 h of the apheresis patient. This resulted in
a MULT about a factor of 10 higher in the self-dosed
individual for this second condition. The MULT for the
other two conditions of interest were similar for both
individuals, different only by a factor of 2­3.
Now that the alternate model is set up with these ratios
and MULT values, the next step is to apply the model to
NHANES data. Measurements of DEHP metabolites in

individual urine samples, along with associated demo-
graphics, are retrieved from the NHANES 2003/2004 dataset
for phthalates. These selections are shown in Table 2.
Targeted selections of individual were made based on their
potential interest in this analysis: they correspond to the three
conditions for which MULT values were developed, and they
also span a range of concentrations within each condition.
There were six individuals for each of the three conditions for
a total of 18 individuals. Half of the individuals within each
condition were specifically selected as having concentrations
higher than typically found, and the other half had
concentrations more like the median concentrations found
in NHANES. The median concentrations of three metabo-
lites within NHANES 2001/2002 were 4.2, 20.1, and
14.0 mg/l, for MEHP, 5OH-MEHP, and 5oxo-MEHP,
respectively (CDC, 2009). Declines were observed in MEHP
in NHANES 2003/2004: the median was 1.9 mg/l. Concen-
trations of the other two metabolites remained similar,
however, with medians at 21.2 and 14.4 mg/l for 5OH-
MEHP and 5oxo-MEHP (CDC, 2009). NHANES 2003/
2004 was the first of the surveys to include 5cx-MEPP, and
the median concentration for that metabolite was 33.0 mg/l,
and therefore, the ratio of the medians for 5cx-MEPP and
5OH-MEHP in NHANES 2003/2004 was about 1.5.
On the basis of the ratios found, the concentration of
5OH-MEHP is multiplied by the appropriate MULT to
estimate the intake dose as per Eq. (1) above. This is
compared with a second estimate of an intake dose, derived
using the creatinine correction approach. David (2000) and
later Wittassek et al. (2007a) provide this generalized
equation to calculate intake dose from urinary excretions of
the first primary monoester phthalate metabolite:
DI ¼ UEÂCE
½ = FueÂ1000 mg=g
½ 
f gÂMWd=MWm ð2Þ
where DI ¼ the daily intake, mg/kg/day; UE ¼ the phthalate
monoester metabolite expressed on a creatinine basis, mg/g
creatinine; CE ¼ the daily creatinine excretion normalized to
body weight, mg/kg/day; Fue ¼is the molar fraction of the
urinary excreted metabolite in relation to the ingested diester
over 24 h after exposure, fraction; 1000 ¼ units conversion
factor, mg/g; MWd, m ¼the molecular weights of the diester
phthalate and monoester metabolites, mg/mole.
This equation can, in fact, be applied to any of the
metabolites, given appropriate assignments of the Fue and
MW parameters, and in this study, intake estimates will be
derived from all four metabolites for each NHANES
individual. Also, the intake will be derived based on the
sum of the four metabolites. The Fue parameter, expressed as
a fraction, ranged from 0.059 to 0.23, corresponding to the
percentages for each metabolite described earlier. For the
calculation based on the sum of the concentrations, the Fue is
the sum of the fractions, which equals 0.63. The molecular
weight of DEHP is 390 mg/mole, and it is 278 for MEHP,
292 for 5oxo-MEHP, 284 for 5OH-MEHP, and 308 for

Results and discussion
Before describing the results of this exercise, it is noted that
the Supplementary Material to this article contains additional
analyses that are pertinent to the discussion, and that will be
referenced. These include an evaluation of the key metabolite
ratios that were found in an experiment involving three
individuals who fasted for 2 days (glass-bottled water only),
and application of the creatinine correction approach to the
two highly exposed individuals.
The results of this analysis are provided in Table 3, which
shows the intake of DEHP calculated for each individual
from NHANES as estimated using both methods. The
creatinine correction approach is applied to all four
metabolites and the total concentration, and the MULT
method is applied to each individual using both values of
MULT. Several trends are apparent from this table, and they
are provided here in list form:
(1) The most important result, for purposes of the analysis in
this article, is that the predictions for condition 3, when
the ratio of the secondary metabolites suggest an intake
that occurred in the most distant past (24 h or more), are
significantly different between the creatinine correction
approach and the MULT approach. The MULT
approach leads to intakes that are between about 10
and 50 times higher than the creatinine correction
approach for five of the six individuals; it is only higher
by factors near and less than five for the other individual.
In contrast, the predictions are about the same between
the creatinine correction and the MULT approach for
condition 1 F when the ratio of the secondary meta-
bolites suggests an exposure in the more recent past. In
fact, the MULT predictions based on the apheresis

patient for condition 1 are mostly lower than the
creatinine correction approach.
(2) For condition 2, when the ratio of the secondary
metabolites suggests an exposure 8­16 h range in the
recent past, the results are different depending on the
MULTused. They are comparable when the MULT was
determined based on the apheresis patient and took on a
value of about 8, but are much higher for the MULT
approach when the value of the MULT was about 90
based on the self-dosed individual's data.
(3) Looking just at the creatinine correction predictions,
several important observations are made, which include:
(a) They are similar among the four metabolites in five of
six cases examined under condition 1, when the
exposure is ``near'' the measurement. It is observed
from Table 2 that the concentration of MEHP is
about a factor of three to five lower than the other
three metabolites in five of the six individuals in
condition 1. As well, the concentrations of the other
three metabolites are within about a factor of two of
each other. These relationships are consistent with the
relationships between the fractions of each metabolite
eliminated after 24 hours from a given dose of DEHP
discussed earlier (which are also the ``Fue'' fraction
parameter used in the creatinine correction approach,
Eq. (2)). The individual identified as ``1a'' had a
unique trend in this group in that the concentration of
MEHP, whereas high at 63 mg/l, is still well over an
order of magnitude lower than the other metabolites,
which had concentrations in the thousands of mg/l. In
this case, the prediction based on MEHP was
appropriately lower by about an order of magnitude
compared with the other metabolites.
(b) In conditions 2 and 3, predictions of DEHP intake
based on MEHP are now the lowest and 5cx-MEPP
predictions now the highest. As can be observed from
Table 2, MEHP concentrations are following further
behind that of the other three metabolites in condition
2 compared with condition 1, and 5cx-MEPP is
getting further ahead of the other metabolites. The
creatinine-based predictions track these trends. In
condition 3, 5cx-MEPP is now even further from the
other three metabolites as compared with the other
categories, and this is reflected in a similar discre-
pancy in creatinine-based predictions F those based
on 5cx-MEPP are 3­5 times higher than those based
on MEHP, 5OH-MEHP, or 5oxo-MEHP.
(c) Predictions based on the total concentration, all fall
within the middle of the predictions bracketed by the
lowest predictions based on MEHP and the highest
predictions based on 5cx-MEPP. This might argue
for the consistent use of a total concentration when
using the creatinine correction approach for estimat-
ing intakes. It might compensate for any misleading
predictions based on subtleties that could occur at the
extremes shown by MEHP and 5cx-MEPP.
(4) All of the trends noted above are the same whether
concentrations taken from NHANES 2003/2004 are
high or more typical. Whereas creatinine-based predic-
tions appears close together for the low concentrations,
there were actually similar proportional differences as
were noted aboveFthese are masked when rounding to
the nearest whole number for the table. Most impor-
tantly, the patterns when using the MULT approach are
the same whether the NHANES concentrations are high
or typical. Specifically, there is a factor of 10 or more
difference between the MULT predictions and the
creatinine predictions in condition 3, regardless of
whether the NHANES concentrations are high or low.
All of these trends in both concentrations and intakes are
consistent with the premise that the urine concentrations
from NHANES 2003/2004 are driven by the most recent
exposure, and that this most recent exposure could have
occurred very ``near'' the time of sampling (``condition 1'' F
a few hours earlier) or could even have occurred ``distant''
from the time of sampling (``condition 3'' F 24 h or more
before the urine sample was taken). In addition, this most
recent exposure could have been large in magnitude or small.
As discussed earlier, the profile of metabolites in the urine will
change over time from a given intake of DEHP, assuming no
further exposures occur. All metabolites will decline in
concentration, but MEHP will decline the fastest because it
has a short elimination half-life of 5 h, and eventually 5cx-
MEPP will dominate the profile as it has the longest half-life
of all metabolites at 15 h. If the most recent intake of DEHP
occurred 24 h or more before the urine sample than the
measurements of metabolites in the urine might not be good
indicators of daily exposure. Certainly, for MEHP, five half-
lives have occurred by the urine sampling time, and the
concentration is subsequently very low in comparison to
what it might have been had urine samples been taken near
the time of exposure. In this case, using MEHP to calculate
daily intake of DEHP might result in a significant
underprediction of the actual DEHP exposure from the
previous day.
The Supplementary Material includes an evaluation of the
creatinine correction approach applied to the two highly
dosed individuals (as creatinine was also measured in the
urine along with the DEHP metabolites). It is shown that
initially for about 8 h after exposure, the creatinine correction
approach would overestimate the known intake, but after
that intakes are underestimated, by up to a factor of 10 after
24 h and up to a factor of 100 after 40 h. The initial
overestimation is not unexpected as the creatinine correction
approach implicitly assumes that every urination event
represents an average for the day, but with first order
elimination kinetics, the initial mass excreted will be higher
Critical evaluation of creatinine correction approach Lorber et al.

than an average with subsequent excretions much lower than
an average. By the second day after the elevated exposure,
only small amounts are excreted by the two individuals and
consequently, the creatinine correction approach predicts
small intakes.
One can now begin to formulate hypotheses about proper
interpretation of NHANES results using the creatinine
correction approach. If a urine sample is taken after an
exposure to DEHP, on the same day of that exposure, there
may be some overprediction and some underprediction, such
that the creatinine correction approach on average might give
a reasonable approximation of exposure. The same might be
true if the exposure was during the previous night and the
sample was taken next morning. However, if the sample was
taken perhaps 24 h or more after the exposure, the under-
prediction might be by a factor of 10 or more. As an
example, say an exposure of 10 units occurred on day 1 and
the measurement was taken that same day after the exposure.
The creatinine correction might be predicting anywhere from,
say, 3­20 units. However, if the measurement is taken more
than 24 h later with no further exposures to DEHP, the
creatinine correction approach might suggest an exposure of
1 unit. If taken 2 days later, the creatinine correction might
suggest an exposure of 0.1 unit.
An underprediction of intakes might be frequent and a
strong deterrent to the regular use of the creatinine correction
approach for DEHP. To gain further insight as to what
NHANES is saying with regard to DEHP exposure, in the
context of the evaluation in this study, the NHANES 2003/
2004 database, including measurements of the four DEHP
metabolites, was rank ordered in two ways: (1) one rank
ordering was based on the concentration of MEHP, from
lowest to highest MEHP, and (2) the second rank order was
based on the ratio examined in this article, the ratio of the
concentrations of 5cx-MEPP to 5OH-MEHP, from lowest to
highest ratio. For each rank ordering, the key ratio was
examined as well as the average concentrations of the four
metabolites. Results of this rank ordering are shown in
Table 4. Looking at the rank ordering based on MEHP
concentrations (the first half of the table), it is observed that
the first quartile is composed entirely of nondetects for
MEHP. The average concentration for the second quartile is
1.3 mg/l. The maximum of that quartile, or the median
concentration in the dataset (however, not the population-
weighted median), is 2.2 mg/l. The averages of the key ratio
for these two quartiles were 1.7 and 2.4. The nondetects and
low MEHP concentrations of these two lower quartiles, in
combination with high ratios, suggests that this half of the
NHANES data set is comprised of individuals whose
exposures to DEHP could be in the (relatively) distant past,
perhaps more than 8 h and even more than 24 h. As discussed
above, the creatinine correction may be underestimating
intakes if the exposure was 8 h or more in the past. The
concentrations increased for the other half of the NHANES
data set, with average quartile MEHP concentrations of 3.7
and 25.7 mg/l. The ratios for the second two quartiles
declined to 1.6 and 1.4. Thus, for this half of NHANES,
the weight-of-evidence suggests that exposures were more
recent and the creatinine correction might give more
appropriate estimates, or even overestimates, of these
exposures. A similar overall finding is noted when examining
the second half of the table, which shows the rank ordering
based on the key ratio. When it is low, as in the first quartile
that has an average ratio of 1.0, the MEHP concentration is
high: 13.3 mg/l. MEHP concentration declines as the key
ratio increases.
Conclusions
The findings in this study hinge on the key assumption that
profile of DEHP metabolites in urine reflects only the most
recent exposure, even if that exposure was 24 h or more in the
past. The issue is just that: can a ratio of 2 (or thereabouts)
between the tertiary and secondary metabolites be explained
by an exposure scenario other than the most recent exposure

being 24 h earlier (or thereabouts; barring measurement
error, of course)? Whether the answer to this question is an
unambiguous ``yes'', then the analysis in this article might be
questioned, because the alternate model is based on single
high exposures to two individuals and the ratios that resulted
from these exposures over time. At the very least, the analysis
in this article represents a limiting case F that the exposures
to these individuals are indeed representative of one possible
exposure scenario which members in the general population
(e.g., as represented in NHANES) are also experiencing.
Actually, one can probably go further than that. If the
elimination of DEHP metabolites does follow first-order
kinetics with overall elimination of half-lives of the key
metabolites on the order of 10­15 h, progressing from
generation of primary, secondary, and then tertiary metabo-
lites, then a qualitative (or a quantitative given time)
argument can be made that a ratio of 2 can occur only
many hours after a single bolus exposure. Otherwise, no
other scenario could result in this high a ratio, as subsequent
and even smaller exposures would produce new mass of
metabolites, added to the reservoir of metabolites from the
earlier dose, such that a high ratio between 5cx-MEPP and
5OH-MEHP would not occur in urine. It stands to reason
that ratios near 1.0 (in the context of the analysis in this
article) can only be explained by one or more exposures near
the time of urine measurement in the same way that high
ratios greater than 2 can only be explained by single distant
exposures.
However, this remains the key uncertainty of this analysis.
Other uncertainties exist as well. The alternate model is based
on exposures of two individuals that were elevated over
background. As elevated exposures, there could be patterns
of metabolism that might not be observed in the general
population mostly experiencing lower exposures. Insight as
to this possibility is gained from a discussion of data in the
Supplementary Materials. That analysis shows the key ratio
of this study in urine samples of three individuals after they
ceased eating, and for 2 days afterwards. The general trend is
that, like the two individuals experiencing high exposures, the
ratio is initially near 1.0, but with time, it rises to over 2.0,
then dips, and then rises again. Overall, the concentrations
decline from the first urination event to levels one-tenth as
high by 24 h and throughout the rest of the fast. These trends
support the hypothesis that food was the primary source of
DEHP exposure to these individuals, and that over time, the
tertiary DEHP metabolite, 5cx-MEPP, will dominate the
profile. However, the rise in the ratio followed by the decline
and then another rise, suggest a mechanism of delayed
metabolism or release of metabolites from body storages.
Other factors that that could affect metabolism include
age, sex, race, method of exposure (oral, dermal, intrave-
nous, and inhalation), and other factors. More longitudinal
data on individuals with known exposures is needed, but this
data could not be found in the literature.
NHANES presents results in terms of percentiles, and the
50th percentile, or the median, is often portrayed as the best
indicator of a central tendency of exposure. However, is it
really the best indicator? Further considering the hypothetical
scenario portrayed earlier, in which the creatinine correction
approach might correctly suggest an intake of 10 units on the
day when the 10 units exposure occurred, but then 1.0 and
0.1 unit exposure occurred for the next 2 days. If this
individual's urine is sampled on these three days, the median
exposure would be estimated as 1.0 units. Is this the best
indicator of the central tendency for this individual? Taking it
further, say an entire population is exposed once every 3 days
to ``10'' units of DEHP, and a random survey takes 1/3 of all
samples on the day of exposure, 1/3 the day after exposure,
and 1/3 2 days after exposure. The ``actual'' mean exposure
is 3.3 units, and if the creatinine correction were applied to
every measurement, one would calculate a mean exposure of
3.7 units. Maybe a better indicator of a central tendency of
exposure to DEHP and other phthalates could be obtained
by using the creatinine correction method on all samples and
then taking the mean, instead of relying on a median.
From a public health perspective, maybe the most
important concern raised in this analysis is the proper
identification and interpretation of those most exposed to
DEHP. CDC (2009) lists the 95th percentile concentration of
MEHP as 31.0 mg/l as though this concentration represented
the 95th percentile in exposure. But maybe all it represents is
a concentration that would result from an exposure (lunch
perhaps) that occurred a few hours before the sample was
taken. Maybe the highest exposures are those where MEHP
is nondetected in the sample, as discussed earlier. Looking
again at the order of the rank based on the key ratio between
5cx-MEPP and 5OH-MEHP, the 95th­100th percentile
individuals had ratios from 3.3 to 20.0 (130 of 2605
individuals). MEHP was nondetected (DL ¼ 0.6) in 75%
of these samples. Would the creatinine correction equation
applied to these individuals have underpredicted DEHP
intakes by up to 2 orders of magnitude?
Although there are uncertainties with the analysis in this
article, it nonetheless suggests that the creatinine correction
approach be applied cautiously for contaminants, which
share these key similarities to phthalates: (1) whereas
exposure is widespread in a population (even 100% of
individuals showing evidence of exposure through urine
measurements), the exact pattern of exposure is still
uncertain. It is not known whether exposures occur once
per day, multiple times within a day, or only sporadically
(every few days or more), and (2) the elimination half-lives of
the metabolites are on the order of hours such that
elimination is substantially complete by 24 h.
Although pointing out these issues, this study cannot,
however, suggest a viable alternative to the creatinine correction
approach at this time. With more experimental data and study
on the human metabolism of phthalates, a simple model, such

as the one developed from the two individuals, could provide a
more valid indication of the timing and magnitude of recent
DEHP exposures. Concurrently, it is recommended that further
study on exposure should focus on the pathways of exposure
and the concentrations found in important exposure matrices,
including food, air, dust, water, cosmetics, medications, and
other exposure media.
