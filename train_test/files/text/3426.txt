Dominance Orientation Influence
Preferences for Lower Pitched Voices
in Political Candidates

Abstract
Humans are equipped with a psychological system of followership that evolved to regulate choices of leaders based partly on
would-be leaders' physiological features. One such feature is voice pitch, which is determined by the physiology of the throat.
Recent studies find that political candidates in modern elections with lower-pitched voices are generally more successful. As
lower-pitched voices are perceived as stronger and more dominant, these findings have been taken to indicate a general pre-
ference for dispositional abilities in leaders to protect and prevail in conflicts. Here we extend upon these findings by demon-
strating that conservatives and Republicans tend to view the world as much more competitive and threatening than liberals and
Democrats. We utilize two existing data sources to show that political candidates with lower-pitched voices are preferred more
among conservative Republicans than among liberal Democrats. In a third study we show that preferences for lower-pitched
candidate voices stem from individual differences in Social Dominance Orientation (SDO). Importantly, across all three studies
subjects' party affiliation, ideology, and SDO only predict preferences for male candidate voices. We conclude with a discussion of
the results in relation to followership psychology and general debates on the rationality of the public with respect to elections.

Introduction
Multiple human psychological systems are designed to extract
information about the dispositions of others from their voices.
The voice pitch of males, for example, correlates negatively with
traits such as their mate value, reproductive success, and invest-
ment in offspring, and people reliably utilize the voice pitch of
others to predict these traits in them (Apicella & Feinberg, 2009;
Apicella, Feinberg, & Marlowe, 2007; Collins, 2000; Feinberg,
Jones, Little, Burt, & Perrett, 2005; Puts, Hodges, Ca
´rdenas, &
Gaulin, 2007; Saxton, Caryl, & Roberts, 2006). Testifying the
importance of vocal information in human social interaction,
research has recently demonstrated its role in another domain:
decisions to follow and support a particular leader. Specifically,
a number of studies utilizing experimental as well as real-world
electoral data find that candidates with lower pitched voices
win more votes (Anderson & Klofstad, 2012; Klofstad,
2013; Klofstad, Anderson, & Peters, 2012; Tigue, Borak,
O'Connor, Schandl, & Feinberg, 2012). Given that deeper
voices are associated with strength, dominant behavior,
muscularity, and masculinity (Evans, Neave, Wakelin, &
Hamilton, 2008; Feinberg et al., 2005; Puts, Gaulin, & Verdolini,
2006; Sell et al., 2010), researchers have argued that this pre-
ference for low-pitched voices reflects a preference for dispo-
sitional abilities in leaders to protect and prevail in conflict
(Tigue et al., 2012).

However, we still have limited knowledge about whether
these average effects reflect a general preference for leaders
with low-pitched voices or whether followers differ in their
preferences for the dispositional cues available in a would-be
leader's voice. In this article, we integrate research on follo-
wership psychology into the study of voice effects (Laustsen &
Petersen, 2015) and argue that followers strategically use voice
pitch cues in order to align themselves with the leaders who
appear most competent, given the followers' perceptions of the
social world and the corresponding problems confronting their
group (Duckitt & Sibley, 2010; Hibbing, Smith, & Alford,
2013; Jost, Federico, & Napier, 2009). We hypothesize that
those who perceive the world as a competitive and dangerous
place should have stronger preferences for dominant leaders
who are perceived as capable of navigating conflicts (see
Laustsen & Petersen, 2015). Others will often be better off with
a less dominant individual as leader.
We test these arguments across three studies of preferences
for lower pitched voices in political candidates in the United
States. In the realm of politics, reliable summary markers for
individual differences in perceptions of the social world are
party affiliations and political ideological predispositions.
Republicans and conservatives are much more likely than
Democrats and liberals to view the world as a competitive and
dangerous place (Duckitt & Sibley, 2010; Hibbing et al., 2013).
In Studies 1 and 2, we therefore utilize existing data sources
(Anderson & Klofstad, 2012; Klofstad et al., 2012) to investigate
whether party affiliations and ideological leanings moderate pre-
ferences for candidates' voices. We find that Republicans and
conservatives display a stronger preference for male political
candidates with lower pitched voices than do Democrats and
liberals. In Study 3, we provide more in-depth evidence for the
psychological basis for these effects. We find that perceiving
society as a competitive jungle and being attuned to group-
based conflict (as measured by Social Dominance Orientation
[SDO], cf. Duckitt & Sibley, 2010; Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth,
& Malle, 1994) helps explain the results from Studies 1 and 2.
The implications of these findings, as well as differences with
respect to preferences for male and female candidate voices, are
discussed in the final section.
Followership Decisions: The Role of Context
and Perceptions
Humans are equipped with a compilation of psychological
mechanisms that evolved to regulate choices of leaders
(Laustsen & Petersen, 2015; Spisak, Dekker, Kru
¨ger, & van
Vugt, 2012a; Spisak, Homan, Grabo, & van Vugt, 2012b; van
Vugt, 2006; van Vugt & Ahuja, 2010). Aligning oneself with
the most competent leader has most likely conferred signifi-
cant and positive fitness benefits to individual followers. For a
substantial part of human evolution, leaders have served as
focal points within groups, coordinating individual behavior
to solve collective problems. More competent leaders would
ceteris paribus have lead to better collective solutions and, as
a consequence, gains in individual fitness.
In order to arrive at adaptive followership decisions, the
psychological system for followership should be designed to
take in all relevant cues of leadership competence and do so
with a flexible sensitivity to the particular circumstances of the
group. In this regard, anthropological research suggests that
decision-making authority is typically granted to different indi-
viduals depending on the type of problem facing one's group at
a given time (Boehm, 2000; van Vugt, 2006; van Vugt & Ahuja,
2010). Perhaps the most direct illustration was the Native
American tradition for appointing two chiefs, one for situa-
tions of war and one for situations of peace, each with a
different skill set (Hoebel, 1954).
Psychological research has recently demonstrated that this
reflects a general pattern: individuals prefer different leaders
under war and peace, respectively. The focus of most of this
research has been facial masculinity as a cue of leader com-
petence. A masculine face is reliably associated with percep-
tions of being dominant and with actual aggressive and
dominant behavior (Carr´
e, McCormick, & Mondloch, 2009;
Geniole, Keyes, Mondloch, Carr´
e, & McCormick, 2012;
Loehr & O'Hara, 2013; Stirrat & Perrett, 2010; Trebicky
´,
Havli
´cek, Roberts, Little, & Kleisner, 2013). Correspond-
ingly, a series of studies have found that leaders with more
masculine faces are preferred among subjects who are primed
with war or between-group conflict scenarios, while subjects
who are primed with peace or cooperation scenarios tend to
prefer leaders with more feminine faces (Spisak, Dekker,
et al., 2012a; Spisak, Homan, et al., 2012b; Laustsen & Peter-
sen, 2015; Little, Burriss, Jones, & Roberts, 2007; Little &
Roberts, 2012; Little, Roberts, Jones, & DeBruine, 2012; Re,
DeBruine, Jones, & Perrett, 2013). Under conflict, individuals
prefer a leader who can enforce collective action against the
enemy. Under peace, in contrast, individuals feel no need to
subject themselves to a dominant, aggressive, and potentially,
exploitive leader (for a discussion, see Laustsen & Petersen,
2015). Recently, these findings have been extended to also
account for how individual differences among followers
shape preferences for masculine-looking leaders. Paralleling
the findings on the contextual moderators of these prefer-
ences, individuals who tend to see the social world as a dan-
gerous and conflict-ridden place in general show greater
preferences for leaders with dominant faces (Laustsen &
Petersen, 2015).
Because human psychology is designed to draw inferences
about dominance and other dispositions not only from facial
cues but also from vocal cues (cf. Feinberg, 2008), we should
expect to see similar patterns in preferences for leaders with
low-pitched voices, a reliable marker of dominance (Dabbs &
Mallinger, 1999; Feinberg et al., 2005; see also Tigue et al.,
2012). Consistent with this, one study has shown that sensitiv-
ity to physical prowess cues in voices is heightened during
wartime (Tigue et al., 2012). In the present article, we extend
this finding and investigate how individual differences related
to perceptions of conflict influence preferences for lower
pitched voices in the context of a key modern followership
decision, voting in elections.

Predictions: Individual Differences
and Preferences for Leaders With
Low-Pitched Voices
In the domain of politics, research increasingly links differences
in political ideology and party preferences to deep-seated person-
ality differences and to differences in fundamental perceptions of
the social world (Alford, Funk, & Hibbing, 2005; Caprara &
Zimbardo, 2004; Carney, Jost, Gosling, & Potter, 2008; Duckitt
& Sibley, 2010; Hibbingetal.,2013; Jostetal.,2009; Oxley et al.,
2008). According to Hibbing, Smith, and Alford (2013, p. 114)
conservatives and liberals basically ``experience and process dif-
ferentworlds''(Hibbingetal.,2013,p.114).Comparedtoliberals
and Democrats, conservatives and Republicans are much more
likely to see the world as a competitive and dangerous place
(Duckitt & Sibley, 2010; Hibbing et al., 2013). This suggests that
Republicansand conservatives will exhibit a largerpreference for
lower pitched candidate voices than will Democrats and liberals
(the conservative Republican prediction). Republicans' and con-
servatives' perception of the world as a hostile place should lead
them to put a premium on dominance in leaders. In the context of
facial cues to dominance, this prediction has already received
support: individuals who vote for a right-wing party tend to prefer
more masculine leaders (Laustsen & Petersen, 2015). Here, we
test whether this also applies to vocal cues to dominance in the
form of voice pitch.
Psychological models of political ideology show that there
are two fundamentally different types of perceptions of the
social world that lead to conservative attitudes and vote choices.
While an orientation toward social threats is at the center of both
types of perceptions, the nature of these threats is different. Here,
we extend previous research by investigating which of the per-
ception types (if any) drive preferences for leaders with low-
pitched voices. By providing an in-depth investigation of the
precise psychological drivers of preference for lower pitched
voices, we stand to gain important insights into how and when
preferences for dominant leaders emerge more generally.
The first perception that underlies conservative psychological
predispositions is the worldview that society is a ``ruthlessly com-
petitive jungle [ . . . ] as opposed to a place of cooperative har-
mony'' (Duckitt & Sibley, 2010, p. 1869). This perception
influences individuals to subscribe to ``values or motivational
goals of power, dominance and superiority over others'' (Duckitt
& Sibley, 2010, p. 1869), which in turn are expressed through
preferences for group-based dominance as indicated by political
attitudes characterized by high social dominance orientation or
``SDO'' (a general attitudinal orientation toward intergroup rela-
tions reflecting preferences for equality or hierarchy between
groups). Finally, individuals high in SDO will subscribe to con-
servative political positions and tend to vote for conservative par-
tiesliketheRepublicans(Duckitt&Sibley,2010,pp.1867­1868).
The second type of perception that underlies conservative
psychological predispositions is the worldview belief that soci-
ety ``is an inherently dangerous, unpredictable, and threatening
place as opposed to being safe, stable and secure'' (Duckitt &
Sibley, 2010, p. 1867). This social worldview makes individ-
uals hold values or motivational goals such as ``establishing
and maintaining collective or social security, order, cohesion,
and stability'' (Duckitt & Sibley, 2010, p. 1867), which in turn
create general preferences for obedience and respect toward
authorities expressed through authoritarian political attitudes
characterized by high right-wing authoritarianism or ``RWA''
(a general attitudinal orientation toward intragroup phenomena
reflecting preferences for coercive social control, conforming
to traditional moral norms, and the like.). Finally, individuals
high in RWA, just as those high in SDO, subscribe to conser-
vative political positions and tend to vote for conservative
parties like the Republicans. Figure 1 illustrates this

``dual-process motivational model'' of ideology and political
preferences (Figure 1 builds on the work by Duckitt and Sibley,
2010, where the two paths to conservatism are linked back to
dispositions to view the social world in particular ways, see
Duckitt & Sibley, 2010, p. 1868):
If a preference for leaders with lower pitched voices is more
widespread among individuals high in competitive jungle
worldview and SDO, it will be an indication that lower pitched
candidate voices are preferred in order to facilitate intergroup
dominance and maintain superiority over other groups. We will
refer to this as the intergroup dominance prediction. If instead
preferences for lower pitched candidate voices are more pro-
nounced among individuals who perceive society as dangerous
and threatening--scoring high in RWA--then it will be an
indication that lower pitched candidate voices are preferred for
defensive reasons of protection against threats to intragroup
cohesion such as for instance nonsubmission and violations
against norms and moral codes. We will refer to this as the
intragroup protection prediction.
Overview of Studies
We test these three predictions in three experimental studies
where subjects choose between lower and higher pitched ver-
sions of the same voices. In Studies 1 and 2, we exploit existing
data sources that have been used to establish the preference for
lower pitched voices in the aggregate (Klofstad, 2013; Klof-
stad, Anderson, & Nowicki, n.d.). To test the conservative
Republican prediction, we reanalyzed these data sources to
assess whether there is variation in this preference across sub-
jects' party affiliation (Studies 1 and 2) and political ideology
(only Study 2). Study 3 was designed to test the intergroup
dominance prediction and the intragroup protection prediction,
and in doing so explore which more distinct psychological
construct drives the preferences for leaders with lower pitched
voices. More specifically, Study 3 measured subjects' SDO,
RWA, and worldview beliefs of society as competitive jungle
and dangerous. In Studies 1 and 2, party affiliation and ideo-
logical predispositions serve as proxies of these more specific
psychological differences. Thus, we can expect the results in
Studies 1 and 2 to be less clear than the results in Study 3
simply because they constitute more noisy measures of the
relevant psychological construct of interest.
Study 1: 2012 Qualtrics Experiment
Material and Method
Five men and five women were recorded speaking the sen-
tence, ``I urge you to vote for me this November,'' a politically
relevant, partisan-neutral statement. The women ranged in age
from 21 to 38 years (x
¯ ¼ 26 years) and the men from 20 to 41
years (x
¯ ¼ 28 years). Voices were recorded as .wav files.
The recordings were manipulated to yield a higher and
lower pitched version of each. Following previous studies on
voice pitch perception (Jones, Feinberg, DeBruine, Little, &
Vukovic, 2008), each recording was altered + .5 equivalent
rectangular bandwidths (ERBs). The relationship between
absolute and perceived pitch in humans is logarithmic (Stevens,
1998), and the manipulation by ERB accounts for this, as it
produces a constant perceivable gap between the manipulated
sound files regardless of the baseline pitch of the original record-
ing (Stevens, 1998).
The pitch of the unaltered female and male voices ranges
from 189 to 207 Hz (x
¯ ¼ 199 Hz) and 91 to 116 Hz (x
¯ ¼ 107
Hz), respectively. The pitch of the higher and lower pitched
female sound files ranges from 214 to 233 Hz (x
¯ ¼ 224 Hz) and
170 to 190 Hz (x
¯ ¼ 181 Hz), respectively. The pitch of the
higher and lower pitched male sound files ranges from 110 to
136 Hz (x
¯ ¼ 127 Hz) and 81 to 98 Hz (x
¯ ¼ 91 Hz), respectively.
Previous studies verified that voters can perceive which voice
of each pair used in this experiment is higher in pitch (Ander-
son & Klofstad, 2012; Klofstad et al., 2012). Here, due to space
constraints on the study questionnaire, only a subset of the
stimuli used by Klofstad, Anderson, and Peters (2012) and
Anderson and Klofstad (2012) were used. An extended descrip-
tion of the voice pitch manipulation is available in Supplemen-
tary Material S1.
Participants and Procedures
Approval to conduct this study was granted by the Duke Uni-
versity (Durham, NC) institutional review board on October 7,
2013 (Protocol B0948). The study was administered online to
803 subjects (400 men and 403 women) by Qualtrics. For this
study, Qualtrics partnered with Sample Strategies to recruit a
general population sample of participants from across the
United States. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 78 years
(x
¯ ¼ 49 years, SD ¼ 13.7 years), and received a cash incentive
after participating (US$1.25). They were invited to participate
in studies by e-mail and through messages on their Sample
Strategies account home page.
Participants were randomly assigned to listen to either the
pairs of male (n ¼ 201 male and 202 female voters) or female
(n ¼ 199 male and 201 female voters) voices. Voters chose
whether to use computer speakers (n ¼ 676) or headphones
(n ¼ 127). Existing research shows that online voice pitch
studies produce results that are comparable to laboratory stud-
ies (Jones et al., 2008; an extended description of the sample
and procedures is available in Supplementary Material S1).
Method of Analysis
The participant is the unit of analysis. Each participant listened
to five sets of male or female voices consisting of a lower
pitched and a higher pitched version of the same voice. For
each of these voice pairs participants chose their preferred
voice. These vote choices were coded 1 if the participant
selected the lower voice and 0 if the higher voice was selected.
Based on the five choices we calculate an average score, which
yields a summary preference ratio ranging from 0 to 1,
4 Evolutionary Psychology
reflecting minimal and maximum preference for lower pitched
voices, respectively.
Study 1 also included measures of subjects' feelings toward
the Democratic and the Republican parties, respectively, on
0­100 feeling thermometers (where 0 and 100 indicate coldest
and warmest feelings, respectively), and we use these measures
to test the conservative Republican prediction. Based on these
scales, we calculate subjects' relative feelings toward the two
parties--Relative Affiliation--as the feeling difference toward
the Republican and Democratic parties, respectively. The Rela-
tive Affiliation score is recoded to a 0­1 scale with 0 and 1
representing relatively warmest feelings toward the Democrats
and Republicans, respectively (x
¯ ¼ 0.455; SD ¼ 0.292).
Finally, existing research often compares groups of individuals
who affiliate strongly with the ideological left/Democratic
party or the ideological right/Republican party when investi-
gating basic differences in preferences, behavior, and physio-
logical reactions (Oxley et al., 2008). Following this approach,
we also perform a quartile split of the Relative Affiliation score
such that we can compare the quartile of subjects who hold the
most positive feelings toward Republican and least positive
feelings toward the Democrats to the quartile of subjects who
hold the most positive toward the Democrats and the least
positive feelings toward the Republicans. We refer to the for-
mer as Pure Republicans (n ¼ 166) and the latter as Pure
Democrats (n ¼ 168).1
We use linear regression to investigate the relationship
between subjects' preferences for lower pitched voices and
their party affiliation and to account for the possibility that
listening to the vocal stimuli through different devices could
affect how it was perceived we control for type of playback
device (i.e., computer speakers vs. headphones). We report
results from these analyses using the Relative Affiliation score
and the comparison between Pure Republicans and Pure Dem-
ocrats, respectively. We also report results for preferences of
male and female candidate voices separately.
Results
As shown in Klofstad, Anderson, and Nowicki (n.d.), a two-
tailed one-sample t-test analysis of the proportion of votes cast
for lower voices (comparison value ¼ .50) shows that male and
female subjects preferred to vote for male and female candi-
dates with lower pitched voices (p < .001). Additionally, an
analysis of variance (ANOVA) in the proportion of votes cast
for the lower pitched voices with participant sex, speaker sex,
and the interaction of the two as the factors, shows that this
preference was significantly stronger when subjects judged
female candidates (F1,788
¼ 30.78, p < .001).
Using first the Relative Affiliation score, our conservative
Republican prediction will be supported if there is a positive
relationship between the Relative Affiliation score and the pre-
ference for lower pitched voices. The results show a positive
trend between the Relative Affiliation score and preferences for
lower pitched male candidate voices, such that the warmer the
feelings toward the Republican party relative to the feelings
toward the Democratic party the stronger the preference for
lower pitched male voices (b ¼ 0.065, p ¼ .200). For female
candidate voices, no such trend was revealed (b ¼ À0.014,
p ¼ .781).
Next, we turn to the comparison between Pure Republicans
and Pure Democrats. The key test of our conservative Repub-
lican prediction is whether Pure Republicans exhibit a stronger
preference for lower pitched voices than Pure Democrats. For
male candidate voices, a significant difference between Pure
Republicans and Pure Democrats is revealed, such that the
former exhibits a stronger preference for lower pitched male
voices (b ¼ 0.093, p ¼ .028). In comparison, no such difference
between Pure Democrats and Pure Republicans is found for
female candidate voices (b ¼ À0.018, p ¼ .672).2 Figure 2
illustrates this pattern and shows the separate preference scores
for lower pitched male and female voices for Pure Democrats
and Pure Republicans, separately.
Figure 2 shows that Pure Republicans in Study 1 had a
stronger preference for male candidates with lower pitched
voices than did the Pure Democrats. A similar difference is
not, however, found with respect to preferences for female
candidate voices (full models for all analyses are provided in
Supplementary Material S2). Altogether, Study 1 provides ini-
tial support for our prediction with respect to male candidate
voices. In Study 2 below, we explore whether this result repli-
cates among subjects who registered as Democrats or Repub-
licans for the 2012 U.S. national elections.
Study 2: 2012 Cooperative Congressional
Election Study (CCES) Experiment
Material and Method
The same treatments from Study 1 were used in this study.
Participants and Procedures
The study included a total of 804 participants (393 men and 411
women) in the 2012 CCES preelection survey (Ansolabehere,
2012; Mann, 2012) conducted online by YouGov between
October 1 and November 5, 2012. Participants ranged in age
from 18 to 90 years (x
¯ ¼ 49 years, SD ¼ 16.4 years). The
sample was matched by YouGov to a representative target
sampling frame of U.S. citizens based on the following vari-
ables: sex, age, race, years of education, interest in politics,
employment status, Evangelical/born-again Christian status,
marital status, partisanship, and ideology (more details on the
matched sampling process for Study 2 [the 2012 CCES] is
available in Supplementary Material S1.A).
Due to limited space on the questionnaire, study participants
were randomly assigned to listen to either the five pairs of male
voices (n ¼ 198 male and 224 female subjects) or the five pairs
of female voices (n ¼ 195 male and 187 female subjects). Voters
chose whether to use computer speakers (n ¼ 717) or head-
phones (n ¼ 87). After listening to each pair of voices, voters
Laustsen et al. 5
were asked which candidate they would vote for. The order of
the pairs of voices, and whether the higher or lower pitched
version of each voice was presented first, was randomized.
Method of Analysis
The individual subject is the unit of analysis. Vote choices were
coded 1 if the voter selected the lower voice and 0 if the higher
voice was selected. Following the procedure described in Study 1,
we calculated the average for these choices, which yields a sum-
mary preference ratio ranging from 0 to 1, reflecting minimal and
maximal preference for lower pitchedvoices,respectively. Study2
includes several measures of relevance for testing the conservative
Republican prediction. First, subjects' voter registration as Demo-
crats (289) or Republicans (242) was collected.3 Second, subjects
reported their party affiliation on a 7-point scale ranging from 0
strong Democrat to 1 strong Republican (x
¯ ¼ 0.449; SD ¼ 0.376).
Finally, Study 2 also includes subjects' ideological self-placement
ona7-pointscalerangingfrom0veryliberalto1veryconservative
(x
¯ ¼ 0.534; SD ¼ 0.311). Analyses apply linear regression and
control for the type of playback device, and we report results for
preferences of male and female candidate voices separately.
Results
As shown in Klofstad (2013), two-tailed one-sample t-test anal-
ysis of the proportion of votes cast for lower voices (comparison
value ¼ .50) shows that male and female subjects preferred to
vote for male and female candidates with lower pitched voices
(p < .01). Additionally, an ANOVA of the proportion of votes
cast for the lower pitched voice with participant sex, speaker
sex, and the interaction of the two as the factors, shows that this
preference was significantly stronger when subjects judged
female candidates (F1,799
¼ 51.20, p < .001).
To test the conservative Republican prediction we use party
registration, party affiliation score, and self-placed ideology as
predictor variables of subjects' preferences for lower pitched
candidate voices. In parallel to the findings in Study 1, we find
that registered Republicans have a significantly stronger pre-
ference for lower pitched male voices than do registered Dem-
ocrats (b ¼ 0.093, p ¼ .004). No such difference is found
between registered Republicans and Democrats with respect to
preferences for female voices (b ¼ 0.020, p ¼ .519).4 Figure 3
illustrates subjects' preferences for candidate voices depending
on subject party registration and candidate voice sex.
This result replicates using the 7-point scale for subjects'
party affiliation; the more subjects affiliate with the Republican
Party, the stronger are their preferences for lower pitched male
candidate voices (b ¼ 0.088, p ¼ .013), whereas no such rela-
tionship exists between party affiliation and preferences for
lower pitched female candidate voices (b ¼ 0. 023, p ¼ .518).
Finally, we use subjects' self-reported political ideology to
predict preferences for lower pitched candidate voices. If our pre-
diction is supported, we should see that preferences for lower

pitched candidate voices increase with conservatism. With respect
to male voices a positive relationship approaching statistical sig-
nificance is found (b ¼ 0.061, p ¼ .166). Yet, ideology does not
relate to preferences female candidate voices in any systematic
way (b ¼ 0.017, p ¼ .695; full models for all analyses from
Study 2 are provided in Supplementary Material S3).
In sum, Studies 1 and 2 provide tentative initial evidence for
our prediction on the basis of existing data sources: affiliation
with the Republican party and conservative political predispo-
sitions positively predict preferences for lower pitched male
but not female candidate voices. Yet, these results do not speak
to the more specific psychological predisposition driving this
preferential difference between liberal Democrats and conser-
vative Republicans. In Study 3, we explore this by testing the
intergroup dominance prediction and the intragroup protection
prediction on original data.
Study 3: MTurk Experiment
Material and Method
For sake of comparability, the same vocal stimuli from Studies
1 and 2 were used in this study.
Participants and Procedures
The study was administered online via Amazon's MTurk plat-
form and included a total of 754 American subjects (372 men
and 382 women) who participated in an online survey con-
ducted early January 2015.5 Participants ranged in age from
18 to 79 years (x
¯ ¼ 38 years, SD ¼ 13.2 years) and received a
cash incentive after participating (US$0.60).
Study participants were randomly assigned to listen to either
the five pairs of male voices (n ¼ 196 male and 185 female
subjects) or the five pairs of female voices (n ¼ 176 male and
197 female subjects). Voters chose whether to use computer
speakers (n ¼ 459) or headphones (n ¼ 295). After listening to
each pair of voices, voters were asked which candidate they
would vote for. The order of the pairs of voices, and whether
the higher or lower pitched version of each voice was presented
first, was randomized.
Method of Analysis
The subject is the unit of analysis. Vote choices were coded 1 if
the voter selected the lower voice and 0 if the higher voice was
selected. Following the procedure described for Study 1, we
calculate the average for these choices, which yields a summary
preference ratio ranging from 0 to 1, reflecting minimal and
maximum preference for lower pitched voices, respectively.
Study 3 included a range of party affiliation variables and
measures of ideological differences to track what drives the
preference for lower pitched candidate voices more specifi-
cally. In the following, all of these measures are recoded to
0­1 scales on which the end point 0 reflects the most left-
leaning/liberal positions, whereas the end point 1 represents
the most right-leaning/conservative positions. First, we asked
subjects if they ``identify more with the Democratic party or the
Republican party.'' Democratic identifiers were coded 0 and
Republican identifiers were coded 1 (don't' know answers are
p = .004
p = .556

not included in the analyses). Next, feeling thermometer ratings
of the Democratic and the Republican parties were obtained
following the procedure described in Study 1 (x
¯ ¼ 0.405;
SD ¼ 0.237). Second, subjects' ideology was measured using
a 11-point self-placement scale from left (0) to right (1) (x
¯ ¼
0.414, SD ¼ 0.272), and following the measure used in Study 2
we also asked subjects to indicate their ideology on a 7-point
scale from extremely liberal (0) to extremely conservative (1)
(x
¯ ¼ 0.406, SD ¼ 0.279). Third, we measured subjects' pre-
ferences for group-based dominance captured by SDO (a ¼
0.901, x
¯ ¼ 0.275, SD ¼ 0.215; based on Ho et al., 2012).
Fourth, subjects' authoritarian values were measured using 8
items capturing RWA (a ¼ 0.890, x
¯ ¼ 0.365, SD ¼ 0.226;
based on Zakrisson, 2005). Finally, we measured subjects'
tendencies to perceive the social world as a competitive jungle
(a ¼ 0.855; x
¯ ¼ 0.280, SD ¼ 0.167) and as a dangerous and
threatening place (a ¼ 0.871; x
¯ ¼ 0.483, SD ¼ 0.203), respec-
tively, based on scales from Duckitt, Wagner, du Plessis, and
Birum (2002; see also Duckitt & Sibley, 2010). All four scales
(SDO, RWA, and the two worldview measures) consist of a set
of 8 balanced items (4 items reversed coded). See Supplemen-
tary Material S4 for the exact wordings of the used items.
Analyses apply linear regression and control for type of
playback device.6 We report separate results for preferences
of male and female candidate voices.
Results
Replicating the central finding from previous studies (see Klof-
stad et al., n.d.; Klofstad et al., 2012), subjects preferred both
lower pitched male (t ¼ 2.960, p ¼ .003) and female voices (t ¼
9.114, p < .001), and this preference was stronger when judging
female candidates (t ¼ 4.045, p < .001).
The results of Study 3 also yield further support for the
conservative Republican prediction. First, a trend suggest that
subjects who identify as Republicans exhibit a stronger prefer-
ence for lower pitched male candidate voices than subjects
identifying as Democrats (b ¼ 0.038, p ¼ .153). No such trend
of party identification relating to preferences for lower pitched
female voices is found (b ¼ 0.010, p ¼ .681).7 Using subjects'
self-placed ideology on the 11-point scale from left (0) to right
(1) as predictor of their voice pitch preferences, we find a
marginally significant effect for choices of male candidate
voices, such that lower pitched voices are increasingly pre-
ferred the more rightwing the subject (b ¼ 0.076, p ¼ .071).
Yet, subjects' ideology does not relate to preferences for lower
pitched female voices (b ¼ À0.026, p ¼ .515).8
We conducted two sets of analyses to test whether the results
described above, and in Studies 1 and 2, are caused by prefer-
ences for group dominance (as suggested by the intergroup dom-
inance prediction) or by preferences for group protection (as
suggested by the intragroup protection prediction). First, we
predict subjects' preferences for lower pitched candidate voices
from general attitudinal predispositions related to authoritarian-
ism and group-based dominance as measured by SDO and
RWA. This reveals a positive marginally significant effect of
SDO (b ¼ 0.104, p ¼ .087) but no effect of RWA (b ¼ 0.034, p
¼ .544) on preferences for lower pitched male candidate
voices. Because RWA and SDO are highly correlated (r ¼
.436, p < .001), any model that includes both predictors likely
suffers from some degree of multicollinearity. Therefore, we
also estimate models with just one of the measures. These
models reveal a clearly significant effect of SDO (b ¼ 0.120,
p ¼ .025) but not of RWA (b ¼ 0.081, p ¼ .103), reinforcing the
support for the effect of SDO on preferences for lower pitched
voices in political candidates. When predicting preferences for
lower pitched female candidate voices neither SDO (b ¼ 0.011,
p ¼ .834) nor RWA (b ¼ À0.062, p ¼ .242) turns out to be
significantly related to the subjects' voice pitch preferences.
This does not change when including the measures separately
(SDO: b ¼ À0.014, p ¼ .784; RWA: b ¼ À0.057, p ¼ .236).
Panel A in Figure 4 illustrates the predictive power of SDO and
RWA on preferences for male and female, respectively.
Next, we use subjects' views of society as a competitive
jungle and a dangerous place as predictors of voice pitch pre-
ferences. For preferences of lower pitched male candidate
voices perceptions of society as a competitive jungle is a pos-
itive and significant predictor (b ¼ 0.139, p ¼ .001). This is not
the case for perceptions of society as dangerous and threatening
(b ¼ À0.005, p ¼ .938). Including the two different worldviews
as individual predictors leads to the same conclusion (compet-
itive jungle worldview: b ¼ 0.138, p ¼ .035; dangerous world-
view: b ¼ 0.022, p ¼ .697). For preferences for female
candidate voices, a view of society as a competitive jungle
negatively and significantly predicts preferences for lower
pitched female voices (b ¼ À0.181, p ¼ .008), whereas percep-
tions of society as a dangerous and threatening place is unre-
lated to this outcome measure (b ¼ À0.016, p ¼ .761). Again,
the same conclusions are reached including the two worldviews
in separate models (competitive jungle worldview: b ¼
À0.185, p ¼ .006; dangerous worldview: b ¼ À0.046, p ¼
.381). Panel B in Figure 4 illustrates the effects of beliefs about
society as a competitive jungle and as a dangerous place,
respectively, on preferences for male and female candidate
voices (full models for all analyses presented from Study 3 are
provided in Supplementary Material S5).
In sum, Figure 4 provides support for the intergroup dom-
inance prediction and not the intragroup protection prediction.
From Panel A, it is clear that subjects' preferences for lower
pitched male candidate voices are driven by SDO and beliefs
about the social world as a competitive jungle rather than by
RWA and perceptions of the social world as dangerous and
threatening. This finding gives us a greater understanding of
the finding across Studies 1, 2, and 3 that Republicans/conser-
vatives more than Democrats/liberals prefer lower pitched
male candidate voices. When it comes to female candidate
voices, Panel B shows that only perceptions of society as a
competitive jungle is a significant but negative predictor of
preferences for lower pitched female voices. This runs counter
to the general pattern of no differences between liberals and
conservatives and Democrats and Republicans on preferences
for female candidate voices across Studies 1, 2, and 3.9
8 Evolutionary Psychology
Discussion
Past research suggests that people have a general preference for
leaders with low-pitched (i.e. dominant) voices (Anderson &
Klofstad, 2012; Gregory & Gallagher, 2002; Klofstad, 2013;
Klofstad et al., 2012; Tigue et al., 2012). Other research on
alternative physical cues of dominance in would-be leaders
(in particular facial masculinity), however, has demonstrated
that preferences for dominance vary across contexts and

individuals. In particular, preferences for masculine and
dominant-looking leader candidates have been found to be
higher among individuals' with a conservative worldview
(Laustsen & Petersen, 2015).
In this article, we have integrated these findings in variation
in preferences for dominant leaders into the literatures on voice
pitch and voting behavior. Adaptationist accounts predict that
different cues to the same behavior within a certain domain
would trigger the corresponding psychological system in sim-
ilar ways (Feinberg, 2008). Just as facial cues related to dom-
inance in would-be leaders have been demonstrated to be
conditionally preferred in order to promote the most competent
leader relative to the problems confronting the group (Laustsen
& Petersen, 2015; Little et al., 2007; Spisak, Homan, et al.,
2012b), we predicted that vocal cues related to dominance are
conditionally preferred in a similar way. Rather than a general
preference for deep, dominant voices, we argued that this pre-
ference should be strongest among Republican and conserva-
tive individuals who, more than Democratic and liberal
individuals, view the social world as more competitive and
dangerous. Moreover, we investigated if the preference for
lower pitched voices is more closely connected to perceptions
of society as competitive or dangerous, as these fundamental
worldviews are linked to conservatism and right-wing ideolo-
gies through distinct and separate causal paths (Duckitt & Sib-
ley, 2010; Duckitt, Wagner, du Plessis, & Birum, 2002).
Consistent with the overall prediction--that lower pitched
candidate voices would be preferred more among right-wing
than among left-wing individuals--the results across Studies 1,
2, and 3 show that individuals affiliated with the Republican
party tend to prefer lower pitched male candidate voices more
than individuals affiliated with the Democratic party. This pre-
ference for lower pitched male candidate voices was also found
to increase with ideological conservatism. Finally, Study 3
show that preferences for deep male candidate voices are dri-
ven by differences in preferences for group-based dominance
as measured by SDO and perceptions of the social world as a
competitive jungle rather than by subscription to authoritarian
values and worldview beliefs of society as dangerous and threa-
tening. Importantly, these findings only relate to preferences
for male and not to preferences for female candidate voices.
Below, we speculate about the potential reasons for this sex
difference.
These results add significantly to prior studies of prefer-
ences for lower pitched candidate voices. Prior research has
established preferences for lower pitched voices in the aggre-
gate. However, it has remained unclear what specifically is
causing preferences for candidate voices. In this article, we
provide some initial answers to this question in two ways. First,
we build on the growing line of research, suggesting that
humans possess a psychological system of followership--a
compilation of mechanisms regulating choices of leaders in
correspondence to perceptions of problems facing one's
group--and argue that this followership psychology should
take in vocal cues to problem-specific leadership competences
just as it is shown to take in and respond to visual cues of
leadership competence (Laustsen & Petersen 2015; Spisak,
Dekker, et al., 2012a; Spisak, Homan, et al., 2012b; van Vugt,
2006; van Vugt & Ahuja, 2010). That is, in parallel to the
finding that conservative individuals prefer leaders and candi-
dates who look masculine and dominant (Laustsen & Petersen,
2015), we should expect that conservative individuals will also
prefer candidates that sound masculine and dominant. Across
the three studies this is exactly what we find.
Second, Study 3 expands existing knowledge about the
causes of the preference for lower pitched candidate voices.
Based on the ``Dual-Process Motivational Model'' for political
ideology (see Duckitt & Sibley, 2010), we find that Republicans'
and conservatives' preferences for lower pitched male voices are
driven by deep-seated psychological differences in preferences
for group-based dominance as captured by SDO and perceptions
of the social world as a competitive jungle. This suggests that
preferences for lower pitched candidate voices reflect prefer-
ences for a leader capable of ensuring that the group increases
its position in the hierarchy vis-a
`-vis other groups rather than a
leader capable of ensuring the stability of the hierarchy within
the group. Based on this, preferences for lower pitched
candidate voices could be at least partially taken to reflect that
voters are voting for aggressive and conflict-oriented leadership
when they are attracted to and select deeper male voices.
As noted throughout the result section party affiliation,
ideology, SDO, and competitive jungle worldview only con-
sistently predict preferences for male and not female candidate
voices. Given that prior research has established that lower
pitched voices are preferred in the aggregate for both male and
female candidates, this difference related to candidate sex is
puzzling. We suspect that one reason individual differences in
the preference for leaders with lower voices are only related to
the perception of male voices is that lower pitched voices in
general are associated with a range of different attributes.
Therefore, it is possible that lower pitched male and female
candidate voices are preferred for different reasons and are
perceived as signals of qualitatively different leadership traits
for males and females. Previously lower pitched voices have
been linked to traits such as dominance, attractiveness, and
ability to provide leadership but also to trustworthiness, hon-
esty, and intelligence (Tigue et al., 2012). Furthermore, strong
evidence exists for a relationship between testosterone and
deeper voices and dominant behavior for males in particular
(Archer, 1991; Bruckert, Li´
enard, Lacroix, Kreutzer, & Lebou-
cher, 2006; Dabbs & Mallinger, 1999; Evans et al., 2008; Fein-
berg et al., 2005; Mazur & Booth, 1998; Puts, Apicella, &
Ca
´rdenas, 2012). This suggests that lower pitched voices are
utilized as a cue for dominant, aggressive behavior, and lead-
ership in males more than in females. Accordingly, future
research should look into the particular trait inferences that
drive preferences for low-pitched voices in female leaders.
We conclude by noting how these results also speak to more
general debates on the rationality of the public in times of
elections. Research shows how factors such as polling location,
the success of local sports teams, and national disasters like
hurricanes and shark attacks can significantly affect the public
10 Evolutionary Psychology
mood and voting behavior (Achen & Bartels, 2004; Healy,
Malhotra, & Mo, 2010; Rutchick, 2010), thereby painting a
picture of an irrational public. From a standard social science
perspective, it is easy to interpret the effects of political candi-
dates' physiological features (such as faces and voice pitches)
in a similar way. Yet, according to the present research, such
inferences might be ill founded. Voters are seemingly not moti-
vated by ignorance and irrationality when they let the voice
pitch of candidates guide their vote choices. Rather, voters use
voice pitch cues to match their candidate preferences and their
perceptions of the social world in adaptive ways. Essentially,
the use of voice pitch cues reflects a motivation to align oneself
with the better leader.

Notes
1. Specifically, we calculate subjects' relative feelings toward the
Republican and Democratic parties: FeelingsRepublican Party
À
FeelingsDemocratic Party
. Subsequently, this variable is split in
quartiles to discriminate between Pure Republicans who are
characterized by very high scores on this variable (as they exhibit
a strong like for the Republican party and simultaneously a strong
dislike for the Democratic party) and Pure Democrats who are
characterized by very low scores on the variable (as they exhibit
a strong dislike for the Republican party and simultaneously a
strong like for the Democratic party).
2. Independent subjects who does not qualify as either Pure Demo-
crats or Pure Republicans (this group is comprised of the middle
50% of the sample on the Relative Affiliation score) are no differ-
ent from Pure Democrats with respect to preferences for male
candidate voices (b ¼ 0.012, p ¼ .741), but like the Pure Democrats
they hold significantly weaker preferences for lower pitched male
voices than the Pure Republicans (b ¼ À0.081, p ¼ .024). Regard-
ing preferences for female voices, this middle group of independent
subjects are not different from neither the Pure Democrats (b ¼
À0.019, p ¼ .592) nor the Pure Republicans (b ¼ À0.002, p ¼ .965).
3. The remaining 273 subjects stated that they were independents,
answered ``other'' or ``no party,'' or declined to answer the
question.
4. Independent subjects--who did not register as Democrats or
Republicans--fall in between the two groups of registered parti-
sans with respect to preferences for male candidate voices as they
are not significantly different from neither the registered Demo-
crats (b ¼ 0.050, p ¼ .143) nor the registered Republicans (b ¼
À0.043, p ¼ .210). Regarding preferences for female voices, this
group of independents are not different from neither the regis-
tered Democrats (b ¼ À0.012, p ¼ .707) nor the registered
Republicans (b ¼ À0.032, p ¼ .346).
5. Denmark does not have an institutional review board for research
outside biomedical research. In accordance with the national sci-
entific guidelines, formal ethical approval for the present research
was not obtained (see http://www.cvk.sum.dk/cvk/home/english.
aspx).
6. Following the procedure in Studies 1 and 2, we also control for the
type of playback device in Study 3. However, while no difference
between subjects using headphones or computer speakers was
found in the first two studies, a difference exists in Study 3 such
that relationships are generally stronger among subjects using
headphones. We can only speculate about the reasons for this dif-
ference, but potentially it is caused by MTurk subjects taking sur-
veys in more noisy environments than subjects in Studies 1 and 2.
However, to avoid any unintended confounds with respect to our
analyses, these are based on all subjects (headphone users and
computer speaker users).
7. Using subjects' Relative Affiliation (difference in feeling thermo-
meter rating toward the Republican and the Democratic parties) to
predict preferences for lower pitched male voices, a similar (and
slightly weaker) trend is found (b ¼ 0.055, p ¼ .267), and again no
such trend is present with respect to preferences for female voices
(b ¼ À0.027, p ¼ .536).
8. A similar trend approaching statistical significance is found with
respect to preferences for lower pitched male voices when the
7-point extremely liberal (0) to extremely conservative (1) scale
is applied (b ¼ 0.056, p ¼ .184), whereas no such relationship is
found regarding preferences for lower pitched female voices (b ¼
À0.044, p ¼ .252). If anything, conservatism is trending toward
being negatively related to preferences for lower pitched female
candidate voices.
9. One might suspect that either subjects' age or sex could confound
the reported results. However, controlling for subjects' age and sex
does not change the results reported in the main text here (see
Supplementary Material S6 for regression coefficients from models
controlling for subject age and sex across all three studies). Second,
with respect to subject sex, one might further imagine that female
subjects' inferences of mate value from male voices drive the
results (cf. Collins, 2000; Feinberg, 2008). However, that is not
the case. Instead, across all three studies we find no evidence that
Republicans' greater preference for lower pitched male candidate
voices is driven female subjects' potentially greater preference for
lower pitched male voices. Instead, irrespective of their sex, sub-
jects who affiliate with the Republican party hold conservative
ideological positions, socially dominant predispositions, and
beliefs of the social world as a competitive jungle have stronger
preferences for lower pitched male candidate voices (see Supple-
mentary Material S7 for results of corresponding analyses).
