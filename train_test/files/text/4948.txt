Introduction
In 2010, there were nearly 400 million women worldwide of
menopausal age (45-54 years), and nearly 500 million women
will be entering the menopause transition over the next 5 to 10
years (United States Census Bureau, 2010). Although many
women transition through menopause with minimal discom-
fort, studies have shown that some women experience distress
during the menopause transition (Alexander et al., 2007;
Bauld & Brown 2009; Gold et al., 2004; Woods & Mitchell
2005). In addition, for some women, a decreased quality of
life is an unfortunate consequence of distressful symptoms
during the menopause transition (Avis et al., 2009; Blümel
et al., 2011; Elavsky, 2009; Utian, 2005a).
Treatment for women during the menopausal transition,
specifically hormone therapy (HT), has raised concerns for
clinicians and women (Theroux, 2010; Writing Group for
the Women's Health Initiative [WHI], 2002). More than
ever before, women seek alternatives such as herbs, soy
products, and natural hormones (Hill-Sakurai, Muller, &
Thom, 2008; Upchurch & Chyu, 2005), but the evidence
does not consistently support the efficacy and safety of
such treatments (Files, Ko, & Pruthi, 2011; Lethaby et al.,
2007). For women whose lives have become disrupted, the
medical community becomes a source of support as they
seek explanations and assistance for their concerns
(Ayuranci, Orsal, Arslan, & Emeksiz, 2010; Blümel et al.,
2011; Guthrie, Dennerstein, Taffe, & Donnelly, 2003).
However, when women present with symptoms attributed to
menopause, the depth and breadth of the women's experi-
ences elude the health care practitioner and few options
exist. What lacks is a clearer understanding of women's
menopausal symptoms within the context of their lives
(Utian, 2005a, 2005b; Woods & Mitchell, 2005).
Background
A challenge in the study of distress during the menopause
transition is that distress may mean different things to differ-
ent people, including women and scientists. The inscrutability
of distress as a concept precludes the ease by which it can be
defined, understood, and measured (Massé, 2000). Generally,
research foci tend to reflect three aspects of distress during
menopause: (a) the primary experience of distress--anxiety,
irritability, angst, depression--often attributed to potential
neuroendocrine changes in the brain (Finset, Overlie, & Holte,
2004; Freeman et al., 2007; Rubinow & Schmidt, 2003;

Distress During the MenopauseTransition:
A Rich Contextual Analysis of Midlife
Women's Narratives

Abstract
In 2010, nearly 400 million women worldwide were of menopause age (45-54).Although many women transition through
menopause with ease, some experience distress and a subsequent decrease in quality of life.The purpose of this qualitative
study was to examine the experiences of distress in women during the menopause transition.A narrative analysis methodology
was used maintaining participants' complete narratives when possible.In-person interviews of 15 midlife women were digitally
audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Women shared narratives of distress related to menstrual changes, emotional
instability, vaginal dryness, and decreased libido affected by their relationships with self, partners, work, and family. Some
experiences were presented against a backdrop of the past and influenced by concerns for the future. Detailed stories
illuminated the effect that distressful symptoms had on quality of life and captured how intricately woven symptoms were
with the women's interpersonal and social lives.

Steiner, Dunn, & Born, 2003; Woods, Carr, Tao, Taylor, &
Mitchell, 2006); (b) a secondary response to the intensity
and impact of empirically supported symptoms related
to menopause, such as hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal
dryness (Avis, Crawford, Stellato, & Longcope, 2001; Brown,
Gallicchio, Flaws, & Tracy, 2009; Guthrie, Dennerstein,
Taffe, Lehert, & Burger, 2004); or (c) psychological states
resulting from the emotional responses to menopause or aging
(Lindh-A, Hoffmann, Hammar, & Kjellgren, 2007; Ogle
& Damhorst, 2005), inability to cope with stressors (Bauld &
Brown, 2009; Kafanelis, Kostanski, & Komesaroff, 2009),
difficult life trajectories (Alexander et al., 2007), or innate
personality traits that cause excessive stress reactions to
midlife challenges (Bosworth, Bastian, Rimer, & Siegler,
2003; Kuh, Hardy, Rodgers, & Wadsworth, 2002). For the
woman experiencing distress, the contextual background
of her life will shape her experience (Strauss, 2011); yet this
is nearly impossible to quantify through the use of instrumen-
tation (Massé, 2000). The scope of her experience is beyond
a questionnaire.
In a review of studies on menopause, Utian (2005b)
declared there is strong evidence to support that only vaso-
motor symptoms and vaginal dryness can be directly attrib-
uted to the endocrinological changes occurring during the
menopausal transition. However, he also emphasized that
social, cultural, psychological, and environmental factors
can influence the variety of responses that midlife women
have to various symptoms, and that there is a "need to
understand the factors that determine this variation in
response" (Utian, 2005b, p. 8). In addition, Woods and
Mitchell (2005) raised the concern that "clinicians do not
have access to data about the meaning women assign to
their experiences" (p. 155). Although efforts have been
made quantitatively and qualitatively to study the psycho-
social tapestry of midlife women, researchers have failed to
capture the details of the rich contextual background of
women's experiences of distress in menopause.
A midlife woman's life is complex; she is situated--
physically, hormonally, emotionally--in her changing body.
She also resides within her social, cultural, and economic
environment. Although she has been the focus of a multi-
tude of studies, the factors examined cannot wholly explain
why some women experience distress during a normal
reproductive transition such as menopause. An in-depth
understanding of the physiological, psychological, social,
and cultural influences of women's experiences of distress
during the menopause transition is lacking. Therefore, to gain
a fuller understanding of the phenomenon, the purpose of the
study was to investigate the various experiences of distress
that women report during the menopausal transition.
The aim of this article is to present the analysis on the
specific context of symptom experience as part of a larger
study on distress during menopause (Nosek, 2007, 2012;
Nosek, Kennedy, & Gudmundsdottir, 2010). The main
research question of the study was as follows:
Research Question 1: From the perspective of the
woman during the menopause transition (meno-
pausal years), what is the essential experience of
distress?
Method
This study used a narrative analysis methodology (Riessman,
1993). As a way to counter more abstract ideas, narratives
create a concrete avenue to explore the understanding of
human existence in relation to an individual's interaction
with the world (van Manen, 1990). Examining the rich con-
textual layers of women's lives through shared stories of
lived experiences allows for the salience of shared meaning
embedded in the social, cultural, and intersubjective life
world of midlife women (Bloom, 1998; Riessman, 1993).
Participants and Recruitment
Women, between the ages of 40 and 60, who were currently
experiencing or had previously experienced distress attributed
to menopause and were English speaking, were considered
eligible participants (Nosek, 2012; Nosek et al., 2010). Only
women who had experienced symptoms as a result of natural
menopause or at least had intact ovaries were considered
unless the symptoms reported were prior to an oophorectomy.
Efforts were made to include women of diverse ethnic, racial,
and cultural backgrounds to gain a broad representation of
experiences (Nosek, 2012; Nosek et al., 2010). Because this
study aimed to capture women who attributed their symptom
experience to menopause, no diagnosing of menopause status
was required other than what the women reported. Women
who were not currently experiencing, or did not in the past
experience, distress during the menopause transition were
excluded because the specific focus of this study was on
women who self-identified as experiencing distress attributed
to menopause.
Most study participants responded to advertisements on
an online community volunteer board or to flyers at grocery
stores posted in two cities in California, USA. The remaining
women were recruited through word of mouth or through
snowballing techniques. A total of 15 women participated
and were offered US$20.00 for each interview.
Data Collection and Analysis
Participants were interviewed in person using an open-
ended interview guide and each interview was digitally
audio recorded. The principal investigator conducted all
interviews of the women who were interviewed once, for
45 min to 2 hr at a confidential place of their choice. A short
questionnaire was used to assess demographics such as age,
marital status, number of children, education level, and
income. Each woman was first asked to share her experi-
ences of menopause and to add any specific stories that
Nosek et al. 3
would elucidate the distress of her experiences. Email
correspondence was also included as data. All data were
collected in 2006 and early 2007.
Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim
by a professional transcriber who included interviewer's
questions and participants' utterances, hesitations, false
starts, and phrases to denote expressions such as laughter
and intonation changes such as a whisper or loudness of
voice. After organizing transcribed interviews in the
ATLAS.ti 5.0 computer program, the interviews were read
several times with attention paid to emerging narratives and
themes. In addition, audio recordings were listened to
during the analyses to capture these fluctuations that aided
in the interpretation of the narratives. Elements from
Riessman's (1993), Gee's (1985, 1986), Labov's (1997),
and van Manen's (1990) methods were used for data analy-
sis. Each offer a different method of analyzing the data but
all the methods are within a narrative analysis methodology
that emphasizes the identification of stories/narratives as a
way of accessing insight to how individuals make sense of
themselves and their external world (Frost, 2009). Gee's
poetic structures were employed for the discussion of find-
ings from the larger study published elsewhere (Nosek,
2012) and was especially useful in the relaying of chaos
narratives that appeared to have no apparent restitution
(Frank, 1995).
Narratives used for this article particularly lent themselves
well to be re-transcribed for analysis per Labov (1997)
because they contained elements of a true story with the des-
ignated components: A = abstract (where narrators denote the
beginning of a story), O = orientation (where we are oriented
to time, place, and characters of the story), CA = complica-
tion action (where actions of the story unfold), E = evaluation
(where narrators offer their emotional response or interpreta-
tion of the unfolded actions), R = resolution (where actions or
crises are resolved), and C = coda (where we are brought
back to present denoting the end of the story). The re-
transcription of the narratives into elements of a story
afforded the salience of what the narrator found important
to relay, with special attention payed to the evaluation as it
reflects the narrator's interpretation of the event, and the
meaning ascribed to it. Whenever possible, narratives were
left whole to maintain the integral threads of participants'
voices and lives. Further details of data collection and analy-
sis are reported elsewhere (Nosek et al., 2010).
Ethical Considerations
The study received ethical approval by the University of
California San Francisco's (UCSF) Committee on Human
Research. Written informed consent was obtained from
each participant. Confidentiality and the right of refusal
at anytime were stressed. Pseudonyms chosen by partici-
pants were used in all documentation and recording of
data.
Study Rigor
Several practices were employed throughout the study that
aimed to establish methodological rigor (Riessman, 1993).
Trustworthiness and credibility were enhanced by including
direct quotes from participants' interviews, incorporating
member checking, using a research team for analysis, focusing
on structure (where stories fell within the text, the utterances,
tone, and volume used) and texture/content (the words chosen,
the interpretations of experiences given by participants), and
spending adequate time with the text to allow for "thick" inter-
pretation (see Nosek et al., 2010, for further details regarding
study rigor).
Findings
Sample Characteristics
Fifteen (N = 15) women between the ages of 40 and 59 were
interviewed for up to 2 hr each. The youngest participant
stated she began experiencing symptoms of menopause at
age 31. Close to half of the women were still in menopause
transition, and the rest were post menopause. A diverse
sample was achieved with ethnic/racial backgrounds that
included Latin, Caucasian, and African American. In all, 7 of
the women were married or living with a partner, whereas 8
were single or divorced. The women's employment included
a range of occupations, and they were well educated and
evenly distributed across income levels (see Table 1).
Symptom Experience
The women reported a range of distressing symptoms such as
hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, decreased libido,
mood changes, menstrual changes, and sleep disruption
(Nosek et al., 2010; see also Table 1). Findings on a theme
related to the stigma of menopause (Nosek et al., 2010), a first
person composite narrative of women's experiences (Wertz,
Nosek, McNiesh, & Marlow, 2011), and a case study on one
woman's transformative journey (Nosek, 2012) have been
previously reported. The findings reported here are exemplars
presented as full narratives that elucidate specific symptoms
of menstrual changes, mood alterations, vaginal dryness, and
decreased libido. Included also are narratives that portray the
consequential impact on quality of life as a result of symptom
experiences. Rich details of how the contextual backdrop of
their lives pertaining to work, relationships, sexuality, and
identity threads through their experiences will be particularly
highlighted and maintained via the presentation of complete
narratives when possible.
Menstrual Changes
Menstrual cycles that were unpredictable, painful, and
heavy were reported by some of the women. One woman
(pseudonym China) described the change in her menstrual
4 SAGE Open
cycles as her main concern in menopause. China was 40
years old at the time of the interview, and reported her
symptoms began when she was in her 30s. She listed other
symptoms such as urinary tract infections and sleep disrup-
tion, and then illustrated how she arrived at determining
her symptoms were due to menopause. "`You're a classic
case,' I've heard it over and over, you know, `for meno-
pause.'"
China occasionally worked as a football game concession
worker. She narrated how the unexpected happened one day
when she was at work. Her narrative is left intact except for
the exclusion of utterances and is presented using Labov's
(1997) narrative approach.
I'm getting to the end of it [period] now. (A)
I got my period a week and a half ago (O)
and I had to [work] a football game
and I was crying, and I thought I had to go pee and
I didn't. (CA)
And I . . . I didn't get a break. I had to beg for one.
I thought I had to [pee] and it turns out it's my period
. . .
It started out as a good day. By the end of it was bad. (E)
It was a disaster . . . (E)
It was horrible. Horrible. (E)
Had I totally expected it and then,
it would have been better. (CA)
I just felt horrible. I felt crampy. I felt both. (E)
I'm dealing with football fans and it's terrible.
So it was like the whole package.
I had to beg for a break because I didn't know what
was going on. (R)
I'm talking about like seven hours later.
And they didn't give me my ten-minute break.
Oh I'm debating whether I want to go back and it's not
laziness. (C)
Well don't you think they'll think I'm lazy? (E)
China brought to attention the distress related to the
unexpected nature of the experience. However, not only did
China have to deal with the physical symptoms of bleeding
and cramping, but the demands of the work environment
also greatly affected the situation causing her more distress.
Amid her discomfort, she was unable to even take a 10-min
break. She worried that if she did not return, they would
think she was lazy. China clearly painted a picture of a
woman anything but lazy, but the unfortunate reality of oth-
ers' inability to ever know what she experienced lingered in
the aftermath of her story. The experienced distress becomes
salient as she describes the unfolding of the day as it started
out "good" and slowly turned "bad." China's evaluative
statements, such as "horrible" (used repetitively) and "disas-

ter," confirm the impact this one day had for her. The pause
that occurred in between the repetition of "horrible" as well as
the decreased tone of her voice to nearly a whisper contrib-
uted to the listener's understanding of the narrator's anguish.
Mood Alterations
Emotional changes that also seemed to be unpredictable
with rapid onsets concerned many of the women, and
reports of their partners, family members, and they them-
selves not recognizing who they have become demonstrated
the accompanied angst it caused. Martha's main distressful
episode was experienced in the context of a relatively stable
work and personal life. Her relationship, a long-term
marriage of 25 years, was generally a source of support for
her. Her sons were grown and living outside the home. The
following narrative about her primary experience of distress
was shared at the very beginning of the interview. Her main
experience of distress was an emotional episode that lasted
only a day or two, but the fear of it repeating and the impact
that it could have on her marriage and work propelled her
to seek immediate treatment. The re-transcription of
her narrative per Labov's (1997) recommendation affords
the reader the ability to follow the unfolding events and
elements of this one point in time story.
Um, but the thing . . . that was really bad (A)
was I just suddenly started feeling (O)
so mentally out of it . . . just crazy. (CA)
Like just very suddenly I felt . . . anxious.
Uh, I felt anxious. I felt paranoid. (CA)
I felt just really, really crazy.
And it was like so out of context with my life, but I
. . . I (E)
just really felt like it had . . . it must be hormonal . . .
(E)
It just . . . it was just so off the scale for me. (E)
I just went running to the doctor to get hormones, (R)
I knew I was either going to lose my relationship,
or I (raising volume) was going to lose my job,
or I was just going to lose my mind.
It's just like that bad. (E)
I cannot possibly function in my life with this. (E)
So, it's . . . it's hard to explain, you know.
Sudden mental illness. (laughter release)
But I just felt so crazy and awful and, you know, just
anxious. (CA)
And just like I wanted to jump out of my skin. (C)
Martha emphasized the unexpectedness of her experience
by using the word sudden twice in the first couple of lines
and juxtaposed it with the contrast of her normal state of
being. She stressed that she did not recall ever having any
incidence like this in the past. Past and future merge in the
present moment of her episode. Loss was the main fear for
the future against the backdrop of a previously calm mind,
and secure job and relationship. Her voice rose during this
part of the story accompanied by a serious toned laughter as
if the incredulousness of the situation was bordering on
absurd.
Candy also shared concerns about mood changes. She
relayed a story that included multiple family members, her
coworkers, her husband, and her cat. Her mother brought to
her attention that her "whole attitude has changed." Her
daughter reprimanded her for "snapping" at her grandmother.
She was "edgy" at work because of "the changes." Her hus-
band just "backs off and he leaves [her] alone." When asked
what she found the most distressful about this, she concluded
with, "My attitude, like I said it scares, it scares me. It really
does because it's like I'm a different, totally different per-
son." Candy expressed fear about not recognizing the person
she had become. She came to this realization in relation to
what was normal for her in the past. She relayed what was
important to her--familiarity of self, and her relationships--
at home and at work.
Vaginal Dryness
Fay lived with her boyfriend who was 12 years younger
than she. This age dynamic became salient at other points
during her interview. She relayed that a great source of her
distress stemmed from vaginal dryness during intercourse.
The following narrative describes one particular night of
lovemaking with her boyfriend and her ensuing distress.
This narrative was also re-transcribed using Labov's (1997)
method because it contained all elements of a true story.
Well I can give you a specific day. Um (pause) . . . (A)
I was going through having sex with my boyfriend (O)
and I was really enjoying it,
and all of a sudden I got really, really dry. (CA)
And he's taking an antidepressant--It took him longer.
And it began to really be painful. (E)
And he didn't want to stop (CA)
because it meant that he'd have to build up impetus
again, (E)
and I had to forcibly ask him to stop and use a
lubricant, (R)
because it was getting painful (E)
and I didn't want to tell him it was getting painful (CA)
because he was . . . I knew if he was hurting me he
would stop. (E)
He wouldn't want to go on.
And um, I just couldn't get through to him (CA)
because he couldn't tell that I needed lubrication
and it was just a painful reminder that I'm getting
old. (E)
So now we keep a ton of lubricant by the bed. (R) (C)
6 SAGE Open
The iterative use of "and" revealed by the re-transcription
of the narrative draws attention to the incessant layers of the
event. The complexity of a symptom such as vaginal dryness
unfolds as Fay relays details of one experience. Even after
"forcing" her boyfriend to stop and use lubrication seems to
resolve the problem, Fay continues on to emphasize the dif-
ficulty in achieving resolution and the meaning it had for
her. We see how Fay's boyfriend's personal circumstance
with depression and subsequent use of antidepressants
affected his ability to reach orgasm, and amassed the distress
related to Fay's vaginal dryness. Yet, the fact that she "didn't
want to tell him" when it began hurting implied a strong
need to care for him and his sexual needs. The 12-year-age
difference between Fay and her boyfriend shaped her experi-
ence of this symptom reflected in her final evaluation that
the whole episode was a reminder of aging. This profoundly
portrayed the intensity of the meaning of the experience for
her. She chose to discount his contribution to the problem
and placed the onus on herself.
Decreased Libido
Martha told of her decreased sexual drive as she shared her
concerns: "The other thing that uh, that was distressing to
me um, was that my libido was really low . . . It's just got-
ten worse and worse. I don't like it at all." She elaborated
about why this was distressful to her. "That's distressing
because I think oh, you know, is this guy going to stay with
me if I don't want to have sex, you know?" The gravity of
her concern was revealed as she emphasized that "it's
really not a good thing." The decrease in libido highlighted
the context of her concern as she worried about the effect
it might have on her relationship. Decreased libido in and
of itself was not an issue for Martha; it was the potential
loss that could occur as a result that troubled her.
A decrease in libido among married women was not
always presented as causing distress in the woman's life as
was the case for Martha. Elizabeth, a 55-year-old woman
who had been married for many years, actually welcomed
the change in focus that a decrease in libido afforded. She
lamented that her previous focus on sex prevented her from
doing things such as "research this historical period, or go
make a quilt or go dancing." However, she revealed the key
to her success as a married woman with a newfound
decreased interest in sex was that her husband had decreased
interest also. "And it works in my relationship with my hus-
band and . . . that's all that matters. And . . . that's what
matters." Her relationship was not threatened by her lack of
libido, in contrast with Martha's experience, and that's "all
that [mattered]."
Work environments, relationships, concerns for the
future, and comparisons with the past affected the women's
experiences of distress. The context of their lives contributed
to, or more accurately constituted, the distress experienced
by the women.
Quality of Life
Various consequences occurred as a result of the women's
menopausal experiences. Some women were concerned that
their symptoms would occur in the middle of a social situa-
tion and that they would be unable to manage their discom-
fort and thus would avoid socializing, or some would change
lifestyles to compensate--ultimately causing a decrease in
quality of life. The following stories depict the consequences
of participants' experiences that contributed to their distress.
What was most significant for China was the develop-
ment of menopausal symptoms early in life. She addressed
how menopause began taking a "toll" on her life quality. The
sudden onset of symptoms precluded her from engaging
socially for she felt her reaction to them would affect her
ability to behave in an acceptable manner. China expressed
the distress of this as she explained that she withdrew because
she did not "want to lash out at people and be in pain and
hunched over." She felt robbed of her youth elaborating,
"I haven't dated in (pause) 2 years or had a boyfriend in 6.
And it just didn't feel good." The following narrative by
China demonstrates how severely China's social life had
been altered by her symptoms.
You're going to laugh at this one. (A)
This isn't even a physical thing.
This was a day I was actually feeling good.
I'll tell what was the most distressing one.
I was going through my temp series; I had ended
a job. (O)
And I'm going down, I'm in the elevator . . .
and I don't know if they were lawyers or accountants
. . .
get on board. Just asked me if um, (CA)
I wanted to join them. I mean as a friend . . . (CA)
I was like I was feeling better but I was like,
what if I see them again? (E)
What if I come here again? What if I don't feel
good? (E)
What if something . . . what if? You know. (sad voice)
I was worried . . . (E)
and I was actually feeling one of my better days.
It was distressing . . . (E)
It's like what if I wasn't feeling good and they're won-
dering (CA)
what's wrong with me and . . . They'd be wondering
why is she so unfriendly? (CA)
I didn't want to come off as being unfriendly.
And he was . . . they were disappointed. (E)
That's how the whole thing came up. (C)
China hesitated to join the party out of fear of what might
happen in the future. She worried about the future as she
feared seeing the men at a later time when she was having
symptoms. It was a fear of what might happen, not only in
Nosek et al. 7
the immediate future but anytime later, that stopped her from
participating in a simple social event. This clearly demon-
strated the social impact of her symptoms on her life and the
subsequent distress.
Nancy's main distress was due to frequent and intense hot
flashes describing, "as soon as one would go away within the
next half hour, one would come back." The frequency and
duration of both the hot flash itself and its "gradual" dissipa-
tion created an almost continuous sensation. They affected
every part of her life. She quit her gym membership because
working out caused an increase in hot flashes. Even reading
a newspaper became difficult: "If I was reading something
and . . . and I had a hot flash, I'd probably quit . . . it would
be distractive. I would lose the point of the article."
Susan Jane addressed a decrease in quality of life as a
result of her 9 months of night sweats. She elaborated, "For
me it was such a decline in the quality of my life and in the
quality of my physicality and the enjoyment of my sexuality
that it wasn't worth it." She spoke of "riding a wave of
ecstasy" until her menopause hit and declared, "that's all
over with, like all this work you've done, you're back to
square one." Her recap of this loss was "a death beyond a
death within a death." Juxtaposing who she was before
menopause with who she became post menopause clearly
portrayed the drastic changes that had occurred for Susan
Jane as well as the subsequent distress (see Nosek, 2012, for
case study of Susan Jane's experience).
The individual experiences of participants' symptoms
varied according to the circumstances and context of the
women's lives and encompassed interpersonal, social, and
work situations. The consequences of symptoms manifested
in a decreased quality of life for many of the women as they
attempted to make sense of their embodied changes.
Discussion
This article focused on the specific contextual background
of women's experiences while adhering closely to the wom-
en's narratives. The intact narratives reported in this study
captured a rich life world perspective and facilitated the
knowledge gained by closely examining the nuances and
intricate web of midlife women's symptom experiences
attributed to menopause. Other findings from the original
study have been reported elsewhere and demonstrate the use
of multiple methods for data analysis (Nosek, 2007, 2012;
Nosek et al., 2010); however, in this article, the narratives
shared were mostly told as complete stories that warranted
the use of Labov's (1997) method. Nonnarrative segments
were also incorporated (Gee, 1985, 1986) in findings shared
by Susan Jane and Nancy that portrayed the effect of symp-
toms on their quality of life, and Candy as she spoke of her
changes in mental state.
These findings demonstrated how the immediate world of
the participants affected their distress, as well as how their
symptom experiences affected their ability to interact with
their immediate world. The temporal contexts of women's
lives became salient as their present situations arose from a
comparison with past circumstances, and poised against
future concerns. In previous studies, references to past are
used generally from a life course perspective, where women's
stressful pasts are demonstrated to predict symptom experi-
ences later in life (Kuh et al., 2002; Schmidt, Murphy, Haq,
Rubinow, & Danaseau, 2004). However, they often imply
that midlife challenges are just another crisis along the dis-
ruptive life trajectory of some women indicating an innate or
learned inability to cope. Future is examined in a manner
such as Reynolds's (2000) study on catastrophizing where
associations between distress and "despairing anticipations
about the future" are found (p. 114). Using those frameworks,
women are seen as inflating situations or lacking ability to
control reactions to current circumstances. The stories told in
this study portray women as having reasonable concerns for
the future situated in socially and culturally shared values and
life experiences. For example, the fact that Candy was expe-
riencing symptoms much earlier than her peers most likely
had contributed to her distress. Not only did she experience
feeling "robbed of her youth," but she may also have lacked a
peer group to share with or gain support from.
Studies have examined other social factors of women's
distress and have found associations with social support,
presence of teens in the house, marital satisfaction, and dif-
ficulties with family members (Avis et al., 2003; Chedraui,
San Miguel, & Avila, 2009; Kuh et al., 2002; Price, Storey,
& Lake, 2008; Schmidt et al., 2004). Avis and colleagues
(2003) found that being married increased quality of life in
midlife women across four ethnic groups. Many of the
women's narratives in this study involved partners. Martha's
marital status contributed to her experiences of distress
mainly for fear of losing her partner due to her emotional
instability and decreased libido. Conversely, Elizabeth's
decreased libido was not a problem for her because of her
husband's acceptance of it, which was "all that mattered."
Fay's being partnered contributed to some of her distress
because of the conflicting circumstances between their sex-
ual needs. Hinchliff, Gott, and Ingleton (2010) conducted a
qualitative analysis of women's sexual relationships during
menopause and demonstrated similar variations in women's
sexual experiences that were greatly dependent on the con-
textual tapestry that existed between the women and their
sexual partners.
Some researchers have proposed that having multiple roles,
including work outside the house, can buffer distressful meno-
pausal experiences as they may increase women's feelings of
self-esteem and self-efficacy (Strauss, 2011). In this study,
women either feared their symptoms would interfere in their
ability to perform at work or work conditions exacerbated
their difficulty in managing their symptoms.
Quality-of-life effects, commonly examined in studies of
menopause, attempt to grasp the severity of symptom experi-
ence. However, the instruments used often fall short of
unveiling the specifics of how the women's lives are affected
(Elavsky, 2009; Schneider, MacLennan, & Feeny, 2008).
8 SAGE Open
Utian (2005a) addressed how vasomotor symptoms can
affect women's quality of life, but added that the "effects
are difficult to quantify because of the many factors that
contribute to overall QOL satisfaction" (p. 3). Conversely,
"many factors" of the participants' lives in this report were
illuminated via the rich stories that the women shared of
their distressful experiences. Avis and colleagues (2009)
reported that all menopausal symptoms examined in their
study of midlife women were significantly positively
related to reduced function on all five domains of a quality-
of-life measurement. This is important to report, but again,
their data founder to enlighten researchers and clinicians of
any specific contextual details of the impact of symptoms
on the women's lives, as well as how the everyday worlds
of the women contribute to the symptoms experienced.
Limitations
Interviewing partners and family members of women may
have illuminated the extended impact of women's distress. In
addition, only heterosexual and able-bodied women partici-
pated. Experiences of lesbian and physically challenged
women would have greatly enhanced the findings.
Conclusion
Experts in the field have recommended the exploration of the
sociocultural elements of menopause experiences (Utian,
2005b; Woods & Mitchell, 2005). The results of this study
revealed complex interpersonal and social elements of symp-
tom experience during the menopause transition. Moreover, the
framework and method used in this study afforded the rich
examination of interactions between women's experiences and
their surroundings in a more informative manner. Qualitative
data allow for a more in-depth view of participants' lives, but
more often than not, reports are given as a thematic analysis
only, with very brief supportive excerpts. Keeping a narrative
intact reveals much more of the intricacies of experiences,
including the players involved, the everyday meaning persons
place on these experiences, and the efforts involved in creating
resolutions. The understanding gained from this narrative
analysis of women's experiences increases the awareness of a
potentially misunderstood group of women.
