of Risky Impulsivity

Abstract: Sex differences in same-sex direct aggression and sociosexuality are among the
most robust in the literature. The present article evaluated the hypothesis that both can be
explained by a sex difference in the willingness to take impulsive risks. Self-report data
were gathered from 3,775 respondents (1,514 female) on same-sex aggression,
sociosexuality, and risky impulsivity. Risky impulsivity was higher for men than for
women (d = .34) and path analysis showed it to be a common cause of same-sex aggression
and sociosexuality for both sexes. However, it did not completely mediate the sex
differences in same-sex aggression and sociosexuality. The results suggest that same-sex
aggression and sociosexual behavior share a common psychological mechanism, but that
fully explaining sex differences in aggression requires a more sensitive assay of impulsive
risk and a consideration of dyadic processes.

Introduction
The phrase direct aggression refers to acts that are intended to harm or injure and
which occur in the presence of both the aggressor and target (Buss, 1961). It may be
physical (e.g., a punch) or verbal (e.g., an insult), but in both cases the target is able to
identify the aggressor and retaliate immediately. The possibility of immediate retaliation is
what makes direct aggression distinct from indirect aggression, which is delivered via
circuitous means and hence conceals the identity of the aggressor (Archer and Coyne,
2005).
Sex differences in the use of direct aggression appear in the first two years of life
and persist through childhood and adolescence (Card, Stucky, Sawalani, and Little, 2008),
although there is always some overlap between male and female distributions. As adults,
men use more direct aggression than women in laboratory settings (Bettencourt and Miller,
1996), as well as in real life settings ­ whether measured by self report (Archer, 2004) or
by frequencies of arrest for violent crime (Roe, Coleman, and Kaiza, 2009). The sex
Same-sex aggression, sociosexuality, and risky impulsivity
difference in direct aggression is consistent across cultures (Archer, 2009; Campbell, 1999)
and time periods (Daly and Wilson, 1988). In contrast, indirect aggression does not show
consistent sex differences in adults (Archer, 2004). Because this article is concerned with
sex differences, the focus will be on direct as opposed to indirect aggression (and the term
aggression will refer to direct aggression). This article also focuses on same-sex, as
opposed to opposite-sex, aggression. Aggression towards opposite-sex targets does not
show a robust sex difference in the male direction (Archer, 2004; Cross, Tee, and
Campbell, in press), and evolutionary accounts of sex differences in aggression have
focused on the role sex-specific selection pressures on same-sex aggression (Campbell,
1999; Daly and Wilson, 1988).
Sex differences in same-sex aggression: Evolutionary accounts
Daly and Wilson (1988) explained men's high levels of same-sex aggression as
follows. Social status and access to sexual partners are a crucial limiting factor in men's,
but not women's, reproductive success ­ the number of offspring who survive to maturity
to reproduce themselves. Furthermore, there is greater variance in reproductive success for
men than for women (see Brown, Laland, and Mulder, 2009, for a review), with men being
more likely than women to fail to reproduce at all. Although for men who engage in
aggression there is a chance of being injured or killed, men who fail to secure a mate face
reproductive death regardless of how long they themselves stay alive. This threat of
reproductive death is sufficiently dire to make risky, aggressive competition adaptive even
when potential costs are high (see Wang, 2002). Although Daly and Wilson's (1988)
analysis is outlined here in terms of the costs of failing to compete, this argument is often
discussed in terms of men's rewards for competing successfully (e.g., "Bigger prizes
warrant bigger gambles." Daly and Wilson, 1988, p. 163).
In a contrasting analysis, Campbell (1999) argued that the low level of same-sex
aggression found in women is not merely the result of an absence of the adaptation for
aggression found in men; it is itself an adaptive trait which serves the function of
safeguarding physical integrity. Although women stand to gain little from competing for
numbers of mates, they have much to compete for in terms of securing the best quality
mates or sequestering food resources for provisioning their offspring. Women's levels of
same-sex aggression, although always lower than men's, are sensitive to resource shortage
in the same way (Campbell, Muncer, and Bibel, 2001). Low levels of aggression between
women are therefore not the result of an absence of female-female competition. However,
there is a stronger selection pressure on women than on men to avoid physical injury
because infants are considerably more dependent on mothers than on fathers. The
detrimental effect of maternal death on infant survival is much stronger and more
consistent than the effect of paternal death (Sear and Mace, 2008). Consequently, women's
physical integrity is more tightly bound to their reproductive success as a whole than
men's, and the resulting selection pressures drive down women's engagement in
aggression.
Sex differences in sociosexuality
Sex differences in sociosexuality, like sex differences in aggression, are marked and

Same-sex aggression, sociosexuality, and risky impulsivity
robust across cultures (Schmitt, 2005). Sociosexuality measures a tendency to change
sexual partners frequently, to desire large numbers of sexual partners, and to require little
or no emotional intimacy in order to have sex (Simpson and Gangestad, 1991). Men in
every region of the world desire a greater number of sexual partners than women do and are
more likely to report actively seeking short-term sexual partners (Schmitt, 2003). Men
report a greater interest in casual sex than women do (Oliver and Hyde, 1993; Petersen and
Hyde, 2010), require less time than women do before consenting to sex with a new partner
(Schmitt, Shackelford, and Buss, 2001) and, after one-night stands, experience fewer
feelings of regret (Campbell, 2008).
Sociosexuality, like aggression, is a form of behavior for which the cost-benefit
trade-off differs for men and women. (see, e.g., Mulder and Rauch, 2009; Penn and Smith,
2007). Women bear greater metabolic costs following a successful conception than men do,
and their ability to make other, potentially better, investments in offspring is limited for
much longer. This makes the consequences of a poor choice of partner more severe for
women than for men (Bjorklund and Kipp, 1996; Trivers, 1972). Men have more to gain
then women from mating with additional partners (Jokela, Rotkirch, Rickard, Pettay, and
Lummaac, 2010), and women suffer reputational costs from unrestricted sexual activity
which men do not (Jonason, 2007). Sexually transmitted infections pass more easily from
men to women than from women to men (Devincenzi et al., 1992). Furthermore, women
are approximately ten times more likely than men to be raped or sexually assaulted (Roe et
al., 2009), and an increased number of sexual partners increases the risk that at least one
partner will be sexually aggressive (Franklin, 2010). Again, this suggests that the optimally
adaptive level of engagement in sexual activity is higher for men than for women.
A common proximate mechanism?
Same-sex aggression and sociosexuality, therefore, both show robust and marked
sex differences which are argued to be the result of differing selection pressures on men
and women. For both forms of behavior, the optimal level of involvement is higher for men
than for women. I therefore postulate that a single proximate psychological mechanism
might underlie the sex difference in both same-sex aggression and sociosexuality, and that
risky impulsivity is a promising candidate for such a mechanism. The risky impulsivity
scale was developed specifically to measure risk-taking which occurs without prior thought
(Campbell and Muncer, 2009). In the following paragraphs I outline the conceptual links
between risky impulsivity and the proximate mechanisms postulated by previous
evolutionary accounts of the sex difference in aggression.
Wilson and Daly (1985) argue that a male "taste for risk" explains men's greater
use of same-sex aggression and there is considerable evidence that men engage in risky
pursuits more than women. Men are more likely to take part in extreme sports, for example
(Murray, 2003), and this form of risk-taking involves careful planning to minimize the
chances of accident. However, men are also overrepresented in illegal drug use
(Degenhardt et al., 2008), dangerous driving convictions (Corbett, 2007), and deaths from
non-vehicle accidents (Pampel, 2001), which implies that men are also more likely than
women to take risks without adequate consideration of the consequences. This suggests
that a measure of risk-taking which occurs without forethought might be instructive in

Same-sex aggression, sociosexuality, and risky impulsivity
developing an account of sex differences in aggression and sociosexuality.
Campbell (1999) argued that women's higher levels of fear was important in
explaining sex differences in aggression, and later outlined a model in which early sex
differences in levels of fear lead to later sex differences in impulsivity, which then mediates
the sex difference in aggression (Campbell, 2006; see also Strüber, Luck, and Roth, 2008).
Girls are more likely than boys to have high levels of fearfulness in childhood (Coté,
Tremblay, Nagin, Zoccolillo, and Vitaro, 2002), and more fearful children develop more
effective control of their impulses (Kochanska and Knaack, 2003). Impulsivity, therefore,
is a construct which is conceptually related to both Wilson and Daly's (1985) and
Campbell's (1999) proposed mechanisms for the sex difference in aggression. Furthermore,
impulsivity is correlated with involvement in aggressive behavior (Henry, Caspi, Moffitt,
and Silva, 1996; Vigil-Colet, Morales-Vives, and Tous, 2008) and sexual risk-taking
(Hoyle, Fejfar, and Miller, 2000). Risky impulsivity is correlated with aggression
(Campbell and Muncer, 2009) and data are suggestive of a correlation with sociosexuality
(Boothroyd, Cross, Gray, Coombes, and Gregson-Curtis, 2011).
The present study
The chief aim of the present study is to test risky impulsivity as a possible common
mechanism for same-sex aggression and sociosexuality. A secondary aim of the present
study was to test the factor structure of risky impulsivity in male and female subsamples
separately. The most widely used psychometric measure of impulsivity (Barratt
Impulsiveness Scale; Patton, Stanford, and Barratt, 1995) has a factor structure which
differs in male and female subsamples (Ireland and Archer, 2008). This is a problem for
any scale being used to investigate sex differences, as any quantitative difference in scores
between the sexes is confounded with qualitative difference in the structure of the trait.
Finally, sex differences in variability in same-sex aggression, risky impulsivity, and SOI
were examined. Archer and Mehdikhani (2003) argue that sexual selection produces greater
variance in men than in women for sexually selected traits, including aggression. If risky
impulsivity and SOI are part of the same sexually selected adaptive complex, then we
might expect to see greater male than female variance in risky impulsivity and SOI as well
as aggression.
It was hypothesized that risky impulsivity would emerge as a common cause of
both same-sex aggression and sociosexuality. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that risky
impulsivity would mediate the sex differences in same-sex aggression and sociosexuality.
Finally, it was hypothesized that same-sex aggression, SOI, and risky impulsivity would
have larger variances in men than in women.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Participants were 3,775 heterosexual adults (1,514 female) aged between 18 and 65
(mean age = 32.5, SD = 9.3 years), who completed a questionnaire posted on a university
website. Ninety-three per cent of the sample classed themselves as European, 2% North
American, 2% British, and 3% other.

Same-sex aggression, sociosexuality, and risky impulsivity
Measures
Risky impulsivity scale. The 12 items in this scale were derived from exploratory
and confirmatory factor analyses of an item pool generated by focus groups (Campbell and
Muncer, 2009), and are designed to measure the tendency to behave in potentially
dangerous ways without prior thought. Example items are "Have another drink even though
I am already drunk," and "Drive too fast when I am feeling upset." Because the main
purpose of this instrument was to assess tolerance of general risk rather than aggression,
none of the items refer to aggressive acts. Campbell and Muncer (2009) report a
Cronbach's alpha of .81 for this scale. Participants were asked "Based on your previous
experiences, how likely would you be to do each of these things on impulse?" and indicated
their answer using a Likert scale from 1 (very unlikely to do this) to 5 (very likely to do
this). The Likert scores for each item were summed to form a scale total.
Sociosexual Orientation Inventory. This 7-item scale was developed by Simpson
and Gangestad (1991) and measures an unrestricted attitude towards sexual behavior. The
first three items are free-response self-report items (e.g., "With how many people have you
had sex in the last 12 months?"). Because these items can cause scores on the whole scale
to be highly skewed, these were recoded onto a 9-point Likert scale, following Penke and
Asendorpf (2008). The SOI also has three attitudinal items (e.g., "Sex without love is OK")
where participants indicate strength of agreement on a 9-point Likert scale, and an item
assessing frequency of sexual desire, which is scored on an 8-point Likert scale. Simpson
and Gangestad report a Cronbach's alpha of .73. High SOI scores are associated with
having sex early in a relationship, and having sexual relationships with more than one
partner at a time.
Self-reported same-sex direct aggression. Archer and Webb (2006) compiled a 16-
item list of acts of direct aggression from items used in other studies of aggressive behavior
(Gergen, 1990; Harris, 1992; Richardson and Green, 1999). This list included four verbal
items (e.g., "screamed at someone") and 12 physical items (e.g., "grabbed someone").
Archer and Webb (2006) reported a Cronbach's alpha of .84 for this scale. In the present
study, participants indicated how many times in the last 12 months they had used each of
the 16 acts towards someone of their own sex by choosing one of five categories, ranging
from "never" to "more than 10 times."
Results
Psychometrics and sex differences
The men in the sample were significantly older than the women, F(1,3774) = 46.57,
p < .001, the mean difference being 2.1 years. Age is therefore controlled in the following
analyses of sex differences.
Sociosexuality. Means and standard deviations for all variables can be found in
Table 1. Cronbach's Alpha for the SOI was .79, which is comparable to the value found in
Simpson and Gangestad's (1991) original article. As anticipated, men scored significantly
higher than women on the SOI (See Table 1). The variance ratio was significantly larger
than 1, indicating greater male variability.
Self-reported aggression. Cronbach's alpha was .89 for same-sex aggression, which

Same-sex aggression, sociosexuality, and risky impulsivity
is comparable to the value given by Archer and Webb (2006). Table 1 shows that, as
hypothesized, men scored significantly higher than women. The variance ratio was
significantly larger than 1, indicating greater male variability.
Risky impulsivity. Cronbach's alpha for the 12-item risky impulsivity scale was
acceptable at .76, which is similar to the value given by Campbell and Muncer (2009).
Men scored significantly higher than women on risky impulsivity (see Table 1), but the
variance ratio was not significantly different from 1, indicating no sex difference in
variability.

Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the factor structure of the risky
impulsivity scale. The model evaluated by Campbell and Muncer (2009) was tested using
AMOS 7. This model had three intercorrelated factors: injury risk, criminal risk, and health
risk. The estimation method used was maximum likelihood. The factor structure was
confirmed on the male data and female data separately. The fit statistics were more than
adequate for both sets of data, 2/df = 8.63, RMSEA = .058, 90% CI [.053, .063], TLI =
.89, CFI = .91 for males; 2/df = 5.39, RMSEA = .054, 90% CI [.048, .060], TLI = .90, CFI
= .92, for females. Inspection of modification indices revealed no alterations that would
improve the fit for either males or females. This indicates that risky impulsivity is a trait
that manifests itself in the same way for both sexes. The factor loading and mean scores for
each item on the risky impulsivity scale can be found in Table 2.

Correlations. Risky impulsivity was significantly correlated with same-sex
aggression and sociosexuality for both men and women (see Table 3). Aggression and
sociosexuality were also significantly correlated for both sexes. Risky impulsivity was
significantly more strongly related to male-male aggression, r = .40, than to female-female
aggression, r = .25 (z = 5.06, p < .001).

Path analysis. In order to test the hypothesis that risky impulsivity drives both
sociosexual and aggressive behaviour, three competing path models were tested. In Model
1, risky impulsivity was a common cause of both sociosexuality and same-sex aggression
(see Figure 1a). In model 2, SOI was tested as a common cause of risky impulsivity and
same-sex aggression. In model 3, same-sex aggression was evaluated as a common cause
of risky impulsivity and SOI. It was hypothesised that only model 1 would show a good fit
to the data. This model fit the data well for both the male (2/df = 2.83, RMSEA = .00, 90%
CI [.00, .05], TLI = 1.00, CFI = 1.00) and the female (2/df = 2.43, RMSEA = .03, 90% CI
[.00, .08], TLI = 0.99, CFI = 1.00) subsamples. For models 2 and 3, the fit statistics were
very poor (model 2, male data, 2/df = 299.05, RMSEA = .36, 90% CI [.33, .40], TLI =
0.09, CFI = .70; model 2, female data, 2/df = 61.12, RMSEA = .20, 90% CI [.16, 24], TLI
= 0.65, CFI = 0.88; model 3, male data, 2/df = 499.24, RMSEA = .47, 90% CI [.44, .51],
TLI = -0.52, CFI = .49; model 3, female data, 2/df = 383.53, RMSEA = .50, 90% CI [.46,
.55], TLI = -1.24, CFI = 0.26). This further supports the argument that risky impulsivity is
a common cause of direct same-sex aggression and sociosexuality.
In order to test the hypothesis that risky impulsivity accounts for the sex differences
in same-sex aggression and sociosexuality, sex was incorporated into the path model (see
Figure 1b). Although there were statistically significant indirect effects of sex on
sociosexuality and same-sex aggression, this model did not fit the data well, 2/df = 142.13,
RMSEA = .193, 90% CI [.178, .209], TLI = 0.62, CFI = 0.81, and allowing for direct
effects of sex on sociosexuality and same-sex aggression improved the model fit
significantly, 2/df = 1.71, RMSEA = .014, 90% CI [.000, .048], TLI = 1.00, CFI = 1.00; 2
change (2) = 424.7, p < .001. This suggests that risky impulsivity accounts for some of the
between-sex variance in same-sex aggression and sociosexuality, but is not enough to
explain it completely.

Discussion
The present study sought to evaluate the hypothesis that same-sex aggression and
sociosexuality share a common proximate psychological mechanism, namely risky
impulsivity, which might also explain sex differences in both of these variables. The
principal finding of the current study is that risky impulsivity appears to be a common
cause of both same-sex aggression and sociosexuality. This implies that the reason these
two variables are related is because they share an element of risk, and that risky impulsivity
represents a single mechanism which underlies individual differences in behavior in two
distinct domains. Furthermore, this relationship holds in both sexes, indicating that within-
sex differences in risky behavior are mediated by the same mechanisms in men and
women.
In terms of evolutionary accounts of same-sex aggression and sociosexuality, the
present results suggest that high levels of impulsivity might have been selected in men
because they served two adaptive functions at the same time: promoting competition with
other males and pursuing mating opportunities. Conversely, low levels of impulsivity might
have been adaptive in women not only because they inhibited dangerous intrasexual
competition but because they resulted in more cautious and restricted sexual behavior.
Impulsivity was therefore subject to two different forms of sex-specific selection pressure.
Sex differences in same-sex aggression and sociosexuality might have evolved
concurrently, with impulsivity as a common substrate. A single common mechanism
representing a tolerance for impulsive risks would be a more parsimonious account of
individual differences in same-sex aggression and sociosexuality ­ and the correlation

Same-sex aggression, sociosexuality, and risky impulsivity
between them ­ than two separate mechanisms governing aggressive and sociosexual
behavior.
The results suggest that risky impulsivity is a measure well suited to investigating
sex differences in risky behavior: There is a significant sex difference in risky impulsivity,
and it has a factor structure that is invariant across the sexes. Risky impulsivity, however,
did not fully account for the sex differences in same-sex aggression or sociosexuality,
despite the evidence that it accounts for significant within-sex variation. The sex difference
in risky impulsivity, although significant, is smaller than the sex differences in same-sex
aggression and sociosexuality and may therefore not be large enough to account for them.
It is possible that risky impulsivity, although a valid measure of individual differences in
impulsive risk-taking, is sensitive enough to detect the sex difference but not sensitive
enough to reflect its magnitude. Risky impulsivity measures the tendency to take risks that
arise commonly in everyday life. Including activities which are slightly more dangerous
might produce more substantial sex differences. However, care would need to be taken not
to compromise the applicability of the scale to community and student samples who might
not have experience of extreme forms of risk-taking.
There was greater male than female variance on same-sex aggression, which is
concordant with Archer and Mehdikhani's (2003) argument that men are more free to vary
in their parental investment strategies than women. SOI also showed greater male than
female variance, which is consistent with the argument that same-sex aggression and SOI
might form part of a single adaptive complex. There was no evidence, however, of greater
variability among men than women in risky impulsivity. At first blush, this appears
inconsistent with the argument that the sex difference in risky impulsivity is the result of
sexual selection, despite the strong relationships between risky impulsivity, same-sex
aggression, and SOI. However, the absence of items relating to extremely risky activities
on the risky impulsivity scale might account for the absence of greater male variance, as
well as the lack of complete mediation of the sex difference in same-sex aggression.
Two further factors to consider in explaining the sex difference in same-sex
aggression are qualitative differences between male and female same-sex aggression, and
the possibility that a mean difference between the sexes has a synergistic effect when
looking at male-male compared to female-female dyadic interactions. First, men's conflicts
are characterized by a need to preserve face in response to a slight or a threat to status
(Felson, 1982). The costs of `backing down' are greater for men than for women (Wilson
and Daly, 1985). Men are more likely than women to use explosive forms of anger
expression such as angry shouting or hitting inanimate objects (an effect which is partially
mediated by risky impulsivity; Campbell and Muncer, 2008). This form of anger
expression might be perceived as threatening, in turn provoking a counter-threatening
response and an upward spiral of aggression. In contrast, women's conflicts are more likely
to be characterized by the use of defusing forms of anger expression such as withdrawing
or crying (Campbell and Muncer, 2008), which are less likely to be perceived as
threatening or provoking and make escalation less likely.
Second, research on the escalation of aggressive behavior in laboratory settings
indicates that when individuals with high trait aggressiveness interact, the trait
aggressiveness levels of both individuals have additive effects on aggressive escalation

Same-sex aggression, sociosexuality, and risky impulsivity
(Anderson, Buckley, and Carnagey, 2008). A relatively small mean difference between
men and women in risky impulsivity might therefore have large effects when same-sex
dyads are considered. This might explain why risky impulsivity is a stronger correlate of
same-sex aggression in men than in women. If interactions between men are characterized
by greater provocation and have a greater tendency towards escalation than interactions
between women, then individual differences in risky impulsivity have greater latitude to
affect the behavioral outcome in the former. All of this suggests that an interactionist
approach to explaining sex differences in aggression is appropriate. An individual's sex
might be a factor in determining their level of tolerance for risk, but it also affects
qualitatively the antagonistic encounters in which they are likely to become involved.
There were, of course, some limitations of the present study. Firstly, limiting the
scope of inquiry to same-sex aggression means that the role of impulsivity in aggression
towards opposite-sex targets could not be addressed. Aggression towards opposite-sex
partners has been shown to relate less strongly than aggression towards same-sex targets to
impulsivity. Future work could examine the role of risky impulsivity in partner aggression
more closely, particularly in same-sex partnerships which are under-researched. Secondly,
the present article cannot address the role of impulsivity in indirect aggression. It was
decided to focus on direct aggression because it carries a risk of immediate retaliation, and
sex differences are evident. Impulsivity might be less relevant to indirect aggression in
which the aggressor has to maintain sufficient self-control to refrain from direct
confrontation and deliver his or her aggressive acts circuitously. Thirdly, because risky
impulsivity did not completely account for the sex differences in same-sex aggression and
sociosexuality, consideration must be given to other possible mechanisms and how they
might interact with risky impulsivity.
To conclude, the present study indicates that same-sex aggression and
sociosexuality are correlated because of their shared element of risk, and that sex
differences in both behaviors might be the result of sex-specific selection pressures acting
on a general tendency to tolerate risk. While risky impulsivity can account for individual
differences in both of these behaviors, a more sensitive measure might be needed to reflect
the true extent of sex differences in impulsive risk-taking. Individual differences in
impulsivity also need to be considered in concert with variables at the dyadic level in order
to give a complete account of sex differences in same-sex aggression.
