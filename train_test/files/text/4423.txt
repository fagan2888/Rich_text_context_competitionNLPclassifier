Introduction
The issue of accountability has been discussed and reported
for various domains (Ammeter, Douglas, Ferris, & Goka,
2004; Dill, 1999; Hall & Ryan, 2011; Hendry & Dean, 2002;
Hochwarter etal., 2007; Huisman & Currie, 2004; Lindkvist
& Llewellyn, 2003). Faculty members in higher education
have faced challenges of academic accountability regarding
the three-facet quality assurance: teaching, research, and stu-
dent advising. The abovementioned academic accountability
is closely interdependent with each other.Academic account-
ability, relating to teaching and learning specifically, has
been addressed and examined through multiple perspectives.
Because teaching and learning are reciprocal processes, the
faculty tends to be the party that is held most accountable for
the results of that process. As early as 1980, Hansen (1980)
discussed the amount of time that the faculty members, who
might be overworked, spent on advising, who they advised,
and the types of activities involved in advising. Maxwell and
Smyth (2010) re-conceptualized thesis supervision and
advising as a research project by accounting for three inter-
related areas: (a) the learning and teaching process, (b) pre-
paring students, and (c) producing research outcomes as a
social practice. When thesis advising, academic advisors
supervise not only graduate students who are writing theses
and dissertations to complete their master's or doctoral
degrees but also mentor them in career planning during their
interactions.
Due to professionalism and obligations, efficiency and
effectiveness of the issues are highly dependent on the
sophisticated use of information and community technolo-
gies (ICTs). Exploiting ICT-supported communication tools
has become undoubtedly vital for managing these delicate
and crucial tasks. The use of ICTs has prompted a gradual
transformation of instructional processes and strategies that
improve instructors' capability to meet the needs of learners.
Feghali, Zbib, and Hallal (2011) posited that the use of ICTs
in academic advising may provide better services to students,
which in turns introduces greater accountability. Because of
complex and time-consuming matters that relate to teaching
and learning accountability, advising tasks often burden fac-
ulty advisors. Yet, not all the faculty members are ready for
the ICTs'integration; needless to say, they remain resistant to
such a shift (Mitchell, Parlamis, & Claiborne, 2015).

Social Contingency and Advising
Accountability: Exploring Contextual
Practice of Instant Messaging
Shinyi Lin1
Abstract
The issue of teaching and learning accountability has been discussed for years. This study focuses specifically on advising
accountability of management education to explore how faculty advisors communicate with their student advisees using
instant messaging (IM) to enhance advising presence primarily based on Tetlock's social contingency model. The dependent
relationships between advisor and advisee are considered a cohort, and their collaboration as a community of practice. Of
the 254 graduate students in the college of management, the result reveals that their perception of advising accountability
has been casually explained by the antecedents, that is, self-efficacy, advising presence, epistemic engagement, advisor
credibility, and their flow experience toward using IM to communicate with their thesis advisors. The research finding
validates intervening factors between students' perception of IM self-efficacy and advising accountability of thesis advisors.
The findings, regardless of the limited generalization, provide prescriptive implications that educational practitioners can use
to evaluate related issues of advising accountability.

2 SAGE Open
The use of instant messaging (IM) has become an aca-
demic advising factor because of its ability to provide real-
time interaction and information exchanges (Bardi & Brady,
2010; Birnholtz, 2010; Sheehan, 2008). In a report on how
Americans use IM, Shiu and Lenhart (2004) found that (a)
nearly 25% of IM users use IM more than they use email.
Nonetheless, most Internet users favor email over IM as
media of communication. In addition, (b) 32% of college
graduates use IM while working, and (c) at-work IM users
tend to be positive about how IM improves work flow and
the quality of their workday. Furthermore, (d) IM users
habitually use specific features to enhance their capability to
communicate and to stay connected with others. This study
includes a brief summary of findings that can be accessed at
a glance, and the additional findings can be accessed in Shiu
and Lenhart (2004). The results indicate that compared with
other communication technologies, IM technologies provide
a superior solution regarding cost-effectiveness and imme-
diacy. Shea and Bidjerano (2010) pointed out that further
research is needed to comprehend self-efficacy (SE) and its
broader concept of online self-regulation of learners.
As the premise of thesis advising to be ensured, the study
addresses two purposes: (a) to present a conceptual frame-
work of thesis advising and the antecedents to accountability
and (b) to explore whether the practical use of ICT-mediated
synchronous communication media promotes advisor avail-
ability to graduate students who are completing their theses.
In the context of thesis writing and advising, the synopsis of
this study lends support to the twofold research question. The
first is to explore how graduate students perceive their self-
accountability while synchronous ICTs, that is, IM, occupy
the main media of mutual discourse. Under the circum-
stances, the next is to identify and validate what the anteced-
ents of advising accountability (AA) are when taking into
account of multiple theoretical models.
Literature Review
A conceptual framework for acknowledging the antecedents
of AA is proposed by integrating flow experience (FE) of
using IM and a community of inquiry (CoI). The proposed
model comprises the notions of epistemic engagement (EE),
advising presence (AP), advisor credibility (AC), FE, and
SE. The hypotheses that are generated using the theoretical
framework are presented. The study provides a substantial
literature review to support the proposed model (Figure 1).
Self-Efficacy for Using IM
SE, which originated from social cognitive theory (SCT), is
used to determine the amount of effort people contribute to
an activity, how long they persevere when confronting obsta-
cles, and how resilient they are when facing adversity
(Pajares, 2002). Because it is part of a belief in personal com-
petence, SE acts on individual behavior in different manners
(van Dinther, Dochy, & Segers, 2011). Pajares (2002) con-
cluded that the sense of efficacy is commensurate with the
effort, persistence, and resilience that a person demonstrates.
The empirical research on SE, which was conducted by
adopted various perspectives, has explored the determinants
of SE and its effects (Hatice, 2011; C.-P. Lin & Bhattacherjee,
2009; Madhavan & Phillips, 2010; McCoy, 2010;
Papastergiou, Gerodimos, & Antoniou, 2011; Shea &
Bidjerano, 2010; van Dinther et
al., 2011). For example,
Papastergiou etal. (2011) used a pretest/posttest experimen-
tal design to examine the effects of multimedia blogging in
physical education on student knowledge and ICT SE. They
found that among students who were interested in ICT, inter-
est might have influenced the development of their SE in
using ICT. In planning technology resources, McCoy (2010)
concluded that educators'awareness of ICT SE could benefit
student learning proficiency, particularly for those above the
age of 25. In their longitudinal study on IM use among
undergraduates in Taiwan, C.-P. Lin and Bhattacherjee
(2009) found that information technology (IT) SE indirectly
influences online social support, which is moderated by ICT
use. Grounded on SCT, one promising area of research has
focused on SE as a predictor of individual perceptions when
it relates to technology proficiency in technology use (S. Lin
& Overbaugh, 2009). Whether SE in using IM has an effect

on the student perception of AA in academic thesis writing is
particularly relevant to the topic of this study.
Flow Experience
When people completely get involved in an activity, an innately
positive experience known as flow emerge to produce intense
feelings of enjoyment (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). Chen,
Wigand, and Nilan (2000) considered flow as an optimal,
extremely enjoyable experience; that is, the FE occurred when
people were fully engaged and involved in activities. In the
state of flow, people typically experience deep enjoyment, cre-
ativity, and a total involvement with life, as well as improved
performance and a sense of satisfaction (Csikszentmihalyi,
2008). Csikszentmihalyi, Abuhamdeh, and Nakamura (2005)
posited that three conditions are necessary for achieving a flow
state. First, being involved in an activity with a clear set of
goals adds direction and structure. Second, an appropriate bal-
ance between the perceived challenges of a task and one's per-
ceived skills is critical; a person should have a considerable
amount of confidence in his or her ability to carry out a task.
Third, clear and immediate feedback to task performance helps
people negotiate changing demands and allows them to refine
their performance and maintain the state of flow. In their large-
scale empirical study, Esteban-Millat, Martínez-López,
Huertas-García, Meseguer, and Rodríguez-Ardura (2014) took
a deep route on understanding antecedents and consequences
of FE in virtual learning environments. They concluded that
when leading students into ICTs-mediated environments,
instructors are accountable for getting them into a flow state.
Pilke (2004) studied the FE of 20 academic students or
postgraduates from a variety of fields, including engineering,
art, educational sciences, and psychology, by using ICTs.
The participants reported that inducing flow in ICT use could
be classified in one of four categories: (a) immediate feed-
back; (b) clear rules and goals; (c) sufficient complexity, but
not to the extent that exhaustion is induced; and (d) dynamic
challenges instead of static challenges. The study of Pilke
(2004) signified the core value to faculty and students of uti-
lizing IM in academic advising, specifically thesis and dis-
sertation advising. In their empirical survey study, Wang,
Hsieh, and Song (2012) validated the relationship between
the use of IM and user satisfaction in the context of building
and maintaining social relationships with others. They found
that the antecedents of user satisfaction include perceived
enjoyment, perceived social presence, and perceived useful-
ness. Therefore, for the purposes of this study, FE comprises
two factors: perceived enjoyment and concentration.
Conceptually defined, enjoyment is the extent to which a
person perceives that using IM is enjoyable, aside from the
performance outcomes associated with using IM, whereas
concentration is the extent to which a person can focus only
on IM when using it (Lu, Zhou, & Wang, 2009).
Hypothesis 1 (H1): SE has a positive effect on FE.
Advising Presence
The concept of AP originates from the notion of CoI identi-
fied by Shea and Bidjerano (2009). They posited that the CoI
framework addresses the processes of instructional conver-
sations within an online learning community likely leads to
EE. Required to cultivate a sustainable learning community,
the CoI framework is the core element of the collaborative
constructivist learning environment (Garrison, Cleveland-
Innes, & Fung, 2010). They also stress that higher order
learning would be best supported in a community in which
learners are engaged in critical reflection and discourse. The
multivariate measure of learning represented by the cogni-
tive presence factor could be predicted according to the qual-
ity of teaching presence and social presence reported by
learners in online courses (Garrison et
al., 2010; Shea &
Bidjerano, 2008). Responding to this research context, the
term advising presence is more appropriate than teaching
presence. Examination of AP should not only be focused on
the task-oriented thesis study, but socio-emotional support
should also be considered to build authentic communication.
Therefore, the FE that is invoked using IM could influence
the students' perception of faculty AP.
Hypothesis 2 (H2): FE has a positive effect on AP.
Again applying CoI in field research, Shea and Bidjerano
(2010) conducted a study of 3,165 students of online and
blended courses from forty-two 2- and 4-year institutions.
They extended the CoI framework by using a learning pres-
ence that was conceptually defined as learner self-regulation,
in addition to the original teaching, social, and cognitive
presence. They found a strong correlation between the CoI
constructs and SE. Students believed that they achieved sig-
nificant learning and that the effort they expended depended
partly on their sense of efficacy. Furthermore, the results
confirmed that a strong correlation existed between con-
structs within the CoI framework and SE. In addition, Hester
(2008) posited that (a) students who interacted frequently
with advisors show increased satisfaction with advising, (b)
a greater number of advising sessions was related to higher
grade point averages (GPAs), and (c) students' knowledge of
university resources and policies increased through advising
sessions.
Hypothesis 3 (H3): SE has a positive effect on AP.
Advisor Credibility
Credibility has been considered in three layers: competence,
trustworthiness, and goodwill (McCroskey & Teven, 1999).
According to the definition given by McCroskey (1998),
competence is the extent to which a person truly understands
the topic being discussed. The second factor, trustworthiness,
is the degree to which a person perceives another person as
4 SAGE Open
honest. The third factor, goodwill, is the perceived caring that
a person sees in a source. Among the three factors, goodwill
might be the most crucial (Punyanunt-Carter & Wrench,
2008). McCroskey and Teven (1999) developed the measure-
ment of source credibility to measure competence, trustwor-
thiness, and goodwill. Therefore,AC is a construct defined by
the three variables of competence, trustworthiness, and good-
will. Regarding the use of ICT-mediated communication to
build a sense of community, Brown (2001) posited three cri-
teria: (a) students who perceive common interests tend to
make contact and form relationships, creating online acquain-
tances; (b) students who interact in a thoughtful way over
time tend to agree with each other to form community accep-
tance; and (c) students who feel rapport, trust, goodwill, and
friendship for each other tend to build camaraderie.
Hypothesis 4 (H4): AP has a positive effect on AC.
Epistemic Engagement
Psychological research on epistemological development
began in the mid-1950s (Hofer & Pintrich, 1997). Within a
multidimensional framework of epistemic beliefs, research-
ers have examined the relationships between students'beliefs
and their use of cognitive processing strategies (Franco etal.,
2012). Similar to the vision of knowledge as an epistemic and
discursive practice, Larreamendy-Joerns and Leinhardt
(2006) have posited that consistency exists between asyn-
chronous learning networks and social constructivist and
sociocultural theories of learning. Larreamendy-Joerns and
Leinhardt (2006) specified that online education integrates a
"vision of knowledge as practice and of learning as emerging
participation in a disciplinary community" (p. 591). In online
education, Shea and Bidjerano (2009) empirically validated
that partially mediated by social presence, a CoI can foster
EE. In another work regarding epistemic communities,
Paavola, Lipponen, and Hakkarainen (2004) analyzed three
models of innovative knowledge communities: Nonaka and
Takeuchi's (1996) model of knowledge creation, Engeström's
(2001) model of expansive learning, and Bereiter's (2002)
model of knowledge building. They found that despite funda-
mental differences, the three models have pertinent common
features; specifically, the dynamic process for transforming
prevailing knowledge and practices is greatly emphasized.
Because online thesis advising is considered a form of epis-
temic community in this study, the support of ICT-mediated
communication can maximize student perception of advisors'
availability to enhance their level of engagement.
Hypothesis 5 (H5): AP has a positive effect on EE.
Advising Accountability
Numerous accountability-related studies that are based on
Tetlock's (1992) social contingency model are rooted in
social psychology. To conceptualize accountability in orga-
nizations, Hochwarter etal. (2007) asserted that levels of
accountability are likely to be inconsistent and even contra-
dictory, even when demands and expectations are equivalent;
such is the nature of felt accountability. Understood as
answerability for performance, accountability raises imme-
diate inquiries for he who holds to account (Romzek, 2000).
Lindkvist and Llewellyn (2003) elaborated that the terms
responsibility and accountability (R/A) are often used inter-
changeably because there is little agreement on their defini-
tions. Regarding academic teaching, Hendry and Dean
(2002) considered accountability to be an explanation of
one's teaching practices. Romzek (2000) proposed two
dichotomous dimensions, namely, sources of authority
(internal/external) and degrees of autonomy (low/high), and
classified four types of accountability: hierarchical, legal,
political, and professional. Berman and Smyth (2013)
brought up that tertiary relationship of advising practices
aims for cognitive enhancement relying on social and cul-
tural activities. Because of this research context, AA indi-
cates factors to which faculty advisors are held liable and
accountable for the professional and social development of
their student advisees. The ICT-mediated communication
between student advisees and faculty advisors is inevitable
for meeting the expectations of degree projects and social
practices. The conceptualization of the research model is
illustrated in Figure 1.
Hypothesis 6 (H6): EE has a positive effect on AC.
Hypothesis 7 (H7): EE has a positive effect on AA.
Hypothesis 8 (H8): AC has a positive effect on AA.
Method
Research Participants and Procedure
The participants in this study were 310 graduate students
who were completing their master's thesis in management at
universities in central Taiwan. The participants completed an
online survey powered by Google DocsTM and took less than
10 min to complete the 24-item questionnaire in addition to
the demographic items. The participants were invited to
respond voluntarily during the spring semester. The data pro-
vided by 56 participants were removed due to their response
of not using IM to communicate with their thesis advisors.
Therefore, the responses from 254 participants were entered
for statistical analysis.
Measures
The 24-item scale composed of six constructs was developed
based on the mentioned literature and was adapted to the
operational definition accordingly to ensure its contextual
consistency. The participants rated their perception level on a
7-point Likert-type scale, which ranged from strongly
Lin 5
disagree (1) to strongly agree (7). The items exhibiting low
loadings on the corresponding construct were eliminated to
enhance the reliability of measures. The appendix presents
the scale items of the measures in this study.
All 24 items were examined for their mean and SD. All
the mean scores ranged from 4.49 to 5.84, which exceeded
the midpoint of the 7-point Likert-type scale. The mean
scores indicated an overall positive response to the variables
in the study. The SD ranged from 1.09 to 1.43, which indi-
cated the limited spread of the participants' responses.
Because of the use of a non-random sample, generalizing the
results of this study was limited to similar groups.
Post Hoc Testing for Common Method Variance
(CMV) Effects
Because of the potential problem of using self-reported mea-
sures in behavioral research, the CMV was attributable to the
measurement method rather than to the constructs that the
measures represent (Meade, Watson, & Kroustalis, 2007;
Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003). The first
statistical procedure used to examine the CMV was Harman's
one-factor test (Podsakoff etal., 2003; Podsakoff & Organ,
1986). In this procedure, all relevant variables are entered
into a factor analysis. During the procedure, a single factor
emerges from the unrotated solution of the factor analysis. In
this study, the first factor accounted for 45.87% of the vari-
ance, and all factors accounted for a total of 72.89% of the
variance. That is, one single factor did not account for the
majority of the covariance among the measures. Therefore,
the CMV was not a problem in testing the hypotheses.
Results
The partial least-squares (PLS) technique was used to esti-
mate the measurement and the structural models. The tech-
nique of PLS-structural equation modeling (SEM) has
become accepted in recent years because of its accuracy and
utility (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2010; Hair, Ringle,
& Sarstedt, 2011; Vinzi, 2010). As a causal modeling
approach, the PLS-SEM is designed to maximize the
explained variance of the dependent latent constructs (Hair
etal., 2011). Because of its predictive orientation, the PLS-
SEM is the preferred method for theory development and
prediction (Hair etal., 2011). Developed by Ringle, Wende,
and Will (2005), SmartPLS 3.0 is a professional application
of PLS-SEM that is used to compute a path model and the
parameter estimation based on a path-weighting scheme.
Descriptive Statistics
Of the 254 participants, 34% (n = 86) were male and 66%
(n = 168) were female. Their ages ranged from 22 to 58
years, and the average age was 30.89 years (SD = 8.47 years).
Regarding the students' status, 61% (n = 154) were full-time
students, and 39% (n = 100) were part-time students.
Regarding the thesis writing stage, 9% of the participants
(n = 24) had not yet determined their thesis topics, 34% (n =
89) had confirmed their thesis topics, 29% (n = 74) were
writing their proposals, and 28% (n = 70) had passed the oral
defense of their theses.
Measurement Model
Convergent validity refers to the extent to which multiple
items or indicators share a proportion of variance. Reliability
is an alternative indicator of convergent validity (Hair etal.,
2010) that has been verified using internal consistency reli-
ability (ICR) and average variance extracted (AVE). Ideally,
acceptable values of ICR exceed .70 (Bollen, 1989; Hair
etal., 2010). An AVE value of .50 or higher suggests ade-
quate convergence, whereas an AVE value of less than .50
implies a higher level of error variance than was explained
by the variance remaining in the measurement model. The
ICR and AVE values of this study met the recommended
thresholds as in Table 1.
Discriminant validity, which refers to whether a given con-
struct is truly distinct from other constructs, could be assessed
using two criteria: (a) the square root of the AVE for each
construct should exceed the correlations between this con-
struct and other constructs and (b) the factor loading should
be larger than cross loadings (Bollen, 1989; Hair etal., 2010).
As shown, the square root of the AVE for each construct
exceeded the correlations between the constructs and all other
constructs (i.e., the off-diagonal elements in the correspond-
ing rows and columns). The factor loading of each construct
(.71-.95) exceeded .70 and the cross loadings. The above
assessment demonstrated that the discriminant validity of the
measures was adequate. In summary, the measurement model
assessment substantiated that all of the construct measures
were reliable and valid. Based on these findings, the follow-
ing step was to examine the structural model focusing on the
hypothesized relationship between the constructs.
Structural Model
The examination of the structural model involved estimating
the path coefficients and the R2 values. The path coefficients
represented the magnitude of the expected change in the
observed variables, and the R2 values indicated the amount of
variance in dependent variables explained by their anteced-
ents (Vinzi, 2010). The R2 values and the path coefficients
demonstrated the extent to which the data validated the
research model. With the bootstrapping procedure, Figure 2
shows the results of the structural model that were assessed
using the overall explanatory power, the estimated path coef-
ficients, and the associated t values of the paths. The primary
advantage of bootstrapping is to allow researchers to assess
the stability of parameter estimates and to accurately report
the values (Byrne, 2013).
6 SAGE Open
As shown in Figure 2, the analysis demonstrates that FE (R2
= .40) was explained by SE ( = .63, p < .001), thus, supporting
H1.AP (R2 = .66) was determined by FE ( = .65, p < .001) and
SE ( = .23, p < .01), thus supporting H2 and H3.AC (R2 = .13)
was explained by EE ( = .29, p < .05) in H6. However, it was
not influenced byAP, indicating that H4 was not supported. EE
(R2 = .46) was explained by AP ( = .68, p < .001), which sup-
ported H5.As a whole,AA(R2 = .60) was directly explained by
AC ( = .72, p < .001) in support of H8; however, it did not
statistically support H7. SE and FE explained 66% of the vari-
ance inAP. Three antecedents, namely, SE, FE, andAP, directly
and indirectly explained 47% of the variance in EE. Four ante-
cedents, namely, SE, FE, AP, and EE, directly and indirectly
explained 13% of the variance in EE. Overall, the five anteced-
ents explained 59% of the variance in AA.
Discussion
As aforementioned, the purpose of this study was to analyze
and validate the determinants of AA by integrating IM in the
context of the development of graduate theses in higher
education. Regardless of the generalization caveat resulted
from the non-representative sample pool, the results showed
that student perception of AP is influenced by both their FE
when using IM and positive interactions in communicating
with their thesis advisors. Therefore, AP influences EE, but
notAC. The students'perception ofAAwas highly dependent
on their awareness of their advisors' credibility but not on the
EE of the students. Based on the tested hypotheses, the results
showed that the student perception of AP was influenced by
SE and FE when using IM. In other words, the FE partly
mediates SE and AP. To increase AP through IM, users must
have sufficient literacy and experience in using the system
interface and application, even if they are efficiently used in
computer-mediated communication applications such as IM.
Advisors are most likely to utilize ICT-mediated communi-
cation such as IM to maximize their availability or virtual pres-
ence; however, this tactic does not directly increase students'
perception of their advisors' credibility. The enhancement of
credibility occurs only when the virtual presence enables cog-
nitive engagement. High levels of AC do not directly result
fromAP but depend indirectly on the levels of EE during thesis

writing. EE fully mediates AP and AC. AP, which originates
from a CoI, indicates a high level of socio-emotional support,
whereas AC indicates the students'perceptions of the advisors'
competency, trustworthiness, and goodwill.
High levels of AA are not directly caused by EE; how-
ever, AA indirectly depends on AC. AC fully mediates EE
and AA. Student perception of AA depends on whether they
believe their advisor to be competent and trustworthy and on
their rapport with them; nonetheless, they consider them-
selves to be accountable for their own cognitive involve-
ment in their theses. To conclude, this study has produced
the following three findings: (a) SE and FE when using IM
are antecedents of AA, (b) the advisor's role (i.e., AP, AC)
mediates the preceding findings, and (c) student advisees
consider their own EE during the thesis advising process.
Sufficient discussion between graduate students and fac-
ulty advisors should involve higher order thinking skills and
encourage critical reflection. Development of critical thinking
can be best supported in an interactive community in which
learners are engaged in critical reflection and discourse
(Mendenhall & Johnson, 2010; Qiyun, Huay Lit, & Jianhua,
2009; Richardson & Ice, 2010). The faculty should cultivate a
responsibility for auditing the quality of teaching and learning
in their classes on an ongoing basis (Dill, 1999). In graduate
programs, the evaluation of thesis advising has not gained as
much attention as student evaluation of teaching (SET) has.
For instance, SET has been extensively applied to all credit
courses to evaluate students' perception of teaching quality.
However, independent studies for theses and/or dissertations
are typically excluded. Nonetheless, additional determinants,
which might be mediated by, or confounded by, the students'
perception of AA, should be identified. Regarding the poten-
tial contributions of this research, IM vendors could reference
