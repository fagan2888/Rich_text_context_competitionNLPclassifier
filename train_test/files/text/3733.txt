Article
There is a severe shortage of special education teachers in
this country, which has increased over the last decade (Payne,
2005). There are not enough special educators each year to
fill the vacancies in the field. The attrition rate of special
educators, especially in the early years of their careers, is
considered a major reason for the teacher shortage
(Billingsley, 2007; Katsiyannis, Zhang, & Conroy, 2003;
Leko & Smith, 2010). Currently, 13.2% of special educators
leave their jobs each year (Plash & Piotrowski, 2006).
Teacher attrition in special education has led to many jobs
left vacant, later filled by uncertified teachers. Provost (2009)
states, "Nine of the 13 educational fields identified by the
American Association for Employment in Education (2008)
as areas of considerable shortage are in special education"
(p. 105). The high turnover rate has a negative effect on stu-
dents as well as the district as a whole. Billingsley (2004a)
posited that future research efforts should focus on how to
retain teachers.
The factors that contribute to the teacher shortage in spe-
cial education are wide reaching, ranging from preparation
programs to the support a teacher receives their first few
years as an educator. Researchers of this topic have focused
on a variety of factors that influence a special educator's
decision to remain in, or leave, the field of special education
(Griffin et al., 2009). In her first critical review of the litera-
ture, Billingsley (1993) divided these factors into three cate-
gories: external, employment, and personal.
Many of the studies produced conflicting results on
whether certain variables promoted attrition or retention. For
instance, Metzke (1988; as cited in Billingsley, 1993) found
uncertified special educators left at a greater rate than fully
certified special educators; whereas McKnab (1983; as cited
in Billingsley, 1993) reported the inverse to be true.
Billingsley (1993) attributed this phenomenon to "the varied
definitions of attrition used, and failure to statistically con-
trol for relevant demographic factors" (p. 150). Subsequent
studies have produced results consistent with Metzke (1988)
who suggested uncertified special educators leave the field
more frequently than fully certified special educators.
The research became more focused on specific variables
from 1992 to 2004, which marks the time period covered in
Billingsley's second review of the literature. Billingsley
(2004b) examined research of demographic factors on attri-
tion. She determined that gender and race do not have a cor-
relation with attrition, but age does. Younger special
educators leave the field more frequently than veteran spe-
cial educators (Boe, Bobbitt, Cook, Whitener, & Weber,
1997).
Given the gap between the number of special education
teachers available and the number of jobs to be filled increases
each year, a critical examination of the literature is imperative
in determining factors relating to both attrition and retention
(Boe & Cook, 2006). This review of the literature focuses on
the following aspects of teacher retention and attrition in spe-
cial education: (a) definition of attrition and retention, (b)

Promoting Special Educator Teacher
Retention: A Critical Review of the
Literature
Jeremy E. Vittek1
Abstract
This article is a critical review of the literature on special education teacher attrition and retention. The research focused
on journal articles from 2004 to present. The results of the study helped define special educator attrition and retention.
The major themes present in the findings were job satisfaction, administrative support, induction programs, and mentoring.
The literature shows a clear need for comprehensive administrative support to improve job satisfaction and the likelihood a
special educator will remain in their job.

characteristics of teachers who remain in their jobs and those
who leave the field, (c) job satisfaction, (d) administrative sup-
port, (e) induction programs, and (f) mentoring. In addition,
implications for future research will be presented. The ques-
tion this research will attempt to answer is as follows: What
variables lead to special educator attrition and retention?
Method
The articles referenced in this literature review were found
by searching ERIC on the online database EbscoHost. The
search parameters were special education teacher attrition,
retention, mobility, and turnover. The terms were searched
separately, as well as in combinations with the root term
"special education." The initial search of the term "special
education teacher attrition" returned 228 results. After refin-
ing the search to only include peer-reviewed journals from
2004 to present, the search yielded 34 results. Reference
pages for each article from the initial search were examined
to find more articles. For this literature review, journals from
to present were used. The articles prior to 2004 were reviewed
by Billingsley in (1993) and (2004b).
Results
Definition of Attrition and Retention
Special educator attrition and retention are defined using a
variety of terms. This document will use the terms outlined
in Billingsley's (1993) review of the literature. If a special
educator remains in the same position as the previous year, it
is called absolute retention (Boe, 1990). If a special educator
stays in the field, but takes another position, it is labeled
"transfers to another special education teaching position."
When special educators transfer to general education posi-
tions, it is called "transfers to general education teaching"
(Billingsley, 1993). The final group, "exit attrition," is for
special educators who leave the field of education. Although
each group causes problems for the field of special educa-
tion, exit attrition is the most serious outcome because it
reduces the overall teacher workforce (Boe et al., 1997).
Demographics of Attrition
Many variables and characteristics have been studied to
determine their correlation with special education teacher
attrition. Among the studied characteristics are age, gender,
experience, and level of education. Olivarez and Arnold
(2006) surveyed 228 teachers in south Texas and determined
the average special education teacher who remained in the
field is Caucasian, has earned a bachelor's degree, and is at
least 30 years old. However, the researchers admit other char-
acteristics must be cross-referenced to have predictive value
relating to teacher retention. In her review of the literature,
Billingsley (2004b) states, "Age is the only demographic
variable that is consistently linked to attrition in the special
education literature" (p. 43). Younger special educators leave
the field at a higher rate when compared with veteran special
educators. This can be attributed to the normal occurrences of
teacher attrition during the first few years of a teacher's
career, combined with the inability to properly manage the
stressors of special education (Nance & Calabrese, 2009;
Schlichte, Yssel, & Merbler, 2005). However, Connelly and
Graham (2009) posit a more significant student teaching
experience may decrease an early career special educator's
intent to leave the field. The research regarding the correla-
tion between gender and special educator attrition has been
inconclusive (Billingsley, 2004b). Although age and years of
teaching experience are correlated with attrition, the scope of
current research is trending toward external variables such as
job satisfaction, administrative support, induction programs,
and mentoring programs.
Job Satisfaction
The level of job satisfaction a teacher experiences can affect
whether a teacher stays in special education, or moves to a
general education position, or leaves the field of education
all together (Gehrke & McCoy, 2007). Many factors directly
contribute to job satisfaction (e.g., administrative support,
stress, and workload). In a study conducted by Stempien and
Loeb (2002), special educators rated themselves lower in
overall job satisfaction than their general education counter-
parts. According to a case study by Billingsley (2007), teach-
ers who left the field cited lack of support from parents and
administrators, too much paperwork, limited availability of
resources, and large class size as the main items that caused
dissatisfaction. In a survey of 57 special educators who
stayed in the field, Fish and Stephens (2010) found that a
teacher's ability to serve his or her students leads to high job
satisfaction, which increases the likelihood the teacher will
stay in the field.
First-year special educators encounter a variety of stress-
ors. A workload that contains students with a variety of dif-
ferent needs, not enough planning time, paperwork, and
current policy are several of the factors that provide stress,
and in turn lower job satisfaction (Plash & Piotrowski, 2006).
Therefore, stress becomes a major factor in job satisfaction
(Stempien & Loeb, 2002).
Special educators are often required to complete work
outside of what is asked of general education teachers, with-
out additional compensation (Thornton, Peltier, & Medina,
2007). This added responsibility is viewed as a hindrance on
the teacher's ability to properly teach their class (Kaff, 2004;
White & Mason, 2006). Kaff (2004) used content analysis to
examine the results of 341 questionnaires, deducing that
instructional delivery is no longer the main role of special
education teachers. However, special educators choose the
field, and stay in it to teach and provide services for their
students (Kaff, 2004). When they are stripped of this role, it
Vittek 3
leads to lower job satisfaction, and ultimately leaving the
field. Consequently, Wasburn-Moses (2009) surveyed in-
service and pre-service special education teachers to deter-
mine the role expectations of each. The authors concluded
pre-service teachers had an accurate expectation of the prob-
lems that they may encounter in their first year. However, the
pre-service teachers viewed their future role as one that is in
line with current policy, whereas practicing teachers
described far different roles. Special educators' roles can
range from those of a classroom teacher to an educational
consultant. Special educators also fill a plethora of roles out
of necessity including the management of problem behaviors
and the administering of social and vocational skills
(Conderman & Katsiyannis, 2002). This confusion of roles
can lead to early stress and burnout because a teacher enter-
ing the field expects a certain role, but may be presented with
something vastly different (Thornton et al., 2007; Wasburn-
Moses, 2009). This additional stress can cause special educa-
tors to leave the field. This role confusion can be alleviated
by proper support from the building administrator.
Administrative Support
According to the research, the lack of support from adminis-
trators contributes to special education teachers leaving their
jobs (Nance & Calabrese, 2009; Schlichte et al., 2005). A sur-
vey by White and Mason (2006) showed teachers and admin-
istrators agreed on the importance of administrator support.
Furthermore, administrative support is imperative to guide
early career special educators through the complex policies in
special education. In a qualitative study, Nance and Calabrese
(2009) found that special education teachers felt a disconnect
with their district administrators, which made it difficult to
acquire the necessary support for their classrooms.
Research indicates a lack of administrative support is a
cause of teacher attrition in special education (Nance &
Calabrese, 2009; Schlichte et al., 2005). There is also litera-
ture that demonstrates the role administrative support plays
with the retention of teachers (Otto & Arnold, 2005; Santoli,
Sachs, Romey, & McClurg, 2008). On reviewing the litera-
ture, Leko and Smith (2010) proposed these suggestions for
administrators to retain special education teachers: "(a)
thinking carefully about school climate, (b) investing in
induction, (c) assigning mentors, (d) providing professional
development, and (e) assigned reasonable roles and respon-
sibilities." Administrators can construct an induction pro-
gram to cover the many supports needed by first-year special
educators. The induction program can provide support and
guidance allowing the special educator to perform their job
while alleviating stress (Leko & Smith, 2010).
Induction Program
The implementation of a comprehensive induction program
tailored specifically to the needs of first-year special
education teachers can have a positive effect on their ability
to perform their job and manage their stress level, and inten-
tion to stay in special education. T. M. Smith and Ingersoll
(2004) found the number of teacher induction programs is
constantly growing. Current research suggests an induction
program containing the necessary elements can help retain
special education teachers (Billingsley, 2004a; Wasburn-
Moses, 2006). These studies indicate a quality induction pro-
gram includes assistance with Individualized Education
Program (IEP) writing, proper mentoring, and appropriate
professional development. Wasburn-Moses (2006) outlined
an induction program that contained assistance for young
teachers in writing IEPs, mentoring from a general and spe-
cial education teachers, and professional development based
on problems early career teachers encounter. Also, induction
programs bridge the gap between preparation programs and
the first year of teaching (Leko & Smith, 2010). Billingsley
(2004a) stated, "One of the most important actions that
schools can take is to provide support to beginning teachers
during these vulnerable first years" (p. 371). A comprehen-
sive induction program can eliminate some of the stress and
negative feelings that often come with being a first-year spe-
cial education teacher (Leko & Smith, 2010).
Comprehensive induction programs provide a new teacher
with guidance that allows them to grow professionally and
personally. Kamman and Long (2010) examined a 3-year
induction program at a school district in St. Louis; the rate of
special education teacher retention trended upward during
the period studied. This induction program utilized special
education-specific strategies to induct and support the begin-
ning teachers. The requirements for an induction program
are different from state to state. Some states, such as West
Virginia, have guidelines that require an induction program
for all beginning teachers, whereas other states do not. Bay
and Parker-Katz (2009) reported all states at least recom-
mend support for early year teachers, but there is not a for-
mat followed by each state or district.
An induction program can help a special educator through
the first few years of teaching, when statistically she or he is
more likely to leave the field. An induction program for spe-
cial education teachers must be separate from the overall
induction program because of the distinctive problems spe-
cial education teachers face early in their careers (Thornton
et al., 2007). A major component of a successful induction
program is a mentoring program. The success of a mentoring
program is predicated on a mentor that provides quality
advice to the young teacher as well as provides them with
someone to open up to (Schlichte et al., 2005).
Mentoring Programs
Mentoring is often used as a synonym for induction.
However, mentoring is a component of an induction pro-
gram. Mentoring can take place in a formal or informal set-
ting. Formal mentoring is defined as a predesigned program
4 SAGE Open
with an assigned mentor. Informal mentoring can take place
when talking with, or observing another teacher or adminis-
trator. Billingsley, Carlson, and Klein (2004) found that first-
year teachers preferred and benefited most from informal
mentoring. Informal mentoring may provide a first-year edu-
cator with more problem-specific advice, rather than a prede-
termined formal mentoring program (Billingsley et al.,
2004). Schlichte et al. (2005) examined this position with a
qualitative study of first-year special educators in Midwestern
states in which the findings suggested a reoccurring theme of
the benefit of relationships with colleagues. Alternatively,
White and Mason (2006) argue first-year teachers find a
basic, structured, and formal mentoring program beneficial.
Mentoring can be delivered in many forms; however, the lit-
erature finds that for first-year educators to be effective, they
must have someone who can address specific problems and
provide them with sound advice (Dempsey, Arthur-Kelly, &
Carty, 2009). Often, this someone is their mentor.
There is research that supports the benefits of informal
and formal mentoring programs. Although the findings dif-
fer, research supports the benefits of having a mentoring pro-
gram and the positive effect it can have on teacher retention.
In addition, there is literature that indicates the mentoring
should continue beyond the first year. Research findings
indicate that special educators run the greatest risk of leaving
in their first 5 years (Gehrke & Murri, 2006; Katsiyannis et
al., 2003). Additional years of mentoring would provide the
mentee with guidance beyond their first year and train them
to someday be a mentor. Providing novice teachers with the
proper mentoring will enhance their job satisfaction and their
ability to perform their job, as well as improve the likelihood
they will stay in their jobs (Brownell, Hirsch, & Seo, 2004;
Thornton et al., 2007).
Special educators find themselves serving multiple roles
in their first years of teaching. Because of the variance in
their responsibilities, it is beneficial to provide them with a
mentor from the special education department, as well as a
mentor from the general education department (Wasburn-
Moses, 2006). The benefit of having a special education and
general education mentor is the wide range of experiences
each can draw on to provide the first-year teacher with spe-
cific advice.
An emerging trend in mentoring is the value of electronic
mentoring, or e-mentoring. S. J. Smith and Israel (2010)
define e-mentoring as "the use of computer-mediated com-
munications such as e-mail, discussion boards, chat rooms,
blogs, Web conferencing, and growing Internet-based solu-
tions that are changing the way mentors and mentees inter-
act" (p. 30). Some issues require immediate attention, but
others can wait until the mentor has a chance to respond. In
face-to-face mentoring, the mentor and mentee may only
meet at a certain time each week, restricting when the mentee
can ask questions. One of the issues with face-to-face
mentoring is the availability of mentors onsite. However,
e-mentoring allows the mentor to communicate with the
mentee from another location and provides a venue for ask-
ing questions at any time (Dempsey et al., 2009). Mentoring
from a distant location also provides the opportunity to men-
tor more than one teacher at a time. In a study to determine
how effective mentoring is in relieving stress, White and
Mason (2006) conclude the location of the mentor does not
affect the benefits of the mentoring experience.
To address the important question of qualifications for
serving in a mentor role, Sindelar, Heretick, Hirsch, Rorrer,
and Dawson (2010) studied the state requirements for becom-
ing a mentor. The most rigorous state was found to be
Louisiana, which requires a minimum of 10 years as a full-
time teacher, a master's degree, and at least one 3-hr course
in mentoring. Research insists there are vast differences
between the problems early career special educators and gen-
eral educators face (Boe, Cook, & Sunderland, 2008;
Stempien & Loeb, 2002); however, there are no states that
distinguish between the two when assigning mentors
(Sindelar et al., 2010). Sindelar and colleagues (2010)
deduced a school district must be aware of the policy regard-
ing mentoring programs and be familiar with the current
research when designing their program.
To properly review the literature on this topic, special
educator attrition and retention must be defined. Billingsley
(1993) provided a definition for each possible outcome when
examining special educators and their career choices. A
plethora of characteristics have been studied to determine the
correlation with attrition and retention. Of the demographic
variables, age was found to be the only one with a correlation
to attrition (Billingsley, 2004b). Although demographics,
aside from age, are not good predictors of attrition, job satis-
faction, however, has a positive correlation with retention
(Fish & Stephens, 2010). A major factor in a special educa-
tor's job satisfaction is administrative support they receive
(Nance & Calabrese, 2009; Schlichte et al., 2005).
Administrators can provide support by ensuring proper
induction, and mentoring programs are in place for begin-
ning special educators. Providing these supports for begin-
ning special educators can improve a beginning teacher's job
satisfaction, and in turn, their probability of remaining in the
field.
Discussion
The themes outlined in this review represent the trend of
focusing on retention to reduce the special education teacher
shortage. Teacher attrition was previously covered in the lit-
erature. The reasons teachers leave special education jobs
(e.g., poor job satisfaction, stress, overworked, lack of sup-
port from administration) are represented in the current lit-
erature and continue to support findings of previous studies.
The induction programs in the reviewed articles were
intense programs that were implemented to retain special
education teachers. Schools may use an induction program
that all teachers go through on entering the district, but it will
Vittek 5
not be effective unless the intricacies of a first-year special
education teacher are considered when designing the pro-
gram. These findings imply that schools are not properly
assimilating their new special education teachers into their
districts. Also, they are not receiving the appropriate mentor-
ing or support from their administrators.
Future research in this area should focus on the four areas
that researchers have found to help teacher retention: job sat-
isfaction, induction programs, mentoring, and administrative
support. Each area has been researched, but it is not exhaus-
tive. There are obvious characteristics that can be scrutinized
within each category.
There is a wealth of research on certain aspects of job
satisfaction such as stress levels and workloads, but a dearth
of research on characteristics such as salaries and supple-
mental compensation. Researchers should examine whether
or not a cross comparison of salaries in school districts
affects attrition levels. Also, because of the added responsi-
bilities that cause stress, the relationship of added compensa-
tion such as extra professional days and stipends on teacher
retention should be researched.
Researchers could investigate different factors of induc-
tion programs and their effect on teacher retention. Past
research can be taken into account when designing and
studying new induction programs. Once there is conclusive
research conducted on induction programs, administrators
can use the literature to formulate their own program. This
cycle of examining the research, choosing the sections that
were successful, implementing the program, and studying its
effectiveness could help shape induction programs across the
country. This could help form future induction programs that
will become more readily used in schools aiming to retain
special education teachers.
Furthermore, mentoring should also be studied based on
the characteristics of the person who is providing the mentor-
ing and whether this mentoring occurs formally or infor-
mally. Researchers could also examine the amount of
mentoring received and how that correlates with teachers
remaining in their jobs or leaving. There is a paucity of
research regarding the school counselor providing mentor-
ing; this strategy should be studied further. Many school
counselors talk to staff members about their stress levels, and
how to deal with the multitude of stressors. Counselors could
be surveyed to determine whether they are aware of the addi-
tional stressors first-year special educators face.
The area that should receive the most attention in future
research is administrative support. There is a lack of research
providing specific strategies to help administrators offer
more support for first-year special educators. The amount of
special education training an administrator has, and how that
affects the level of support they provide their teachers, is a
study that would provide insights into a potential strategy.
Also, future research should focus on the specific definition
of support as perceived by administrators and special educa-
tion teachers. This could show a gap in how each group per-
ceives it and provide a starting point to close the gap.
Researchers exploring this topic should consider the sug-
gestions above. The themes mentioned can be studied indi-
vidually or in conjunction with other suggestions. Each of
the themes is interrelated. Administrative support could be
studied with each of the other themes because the adminis-
trator would directly design the induction program, assign
the mentor, and have an overall effect on job satisfaction.
Future consideration should be given to provide special
education teachers with more support and opportunities to
grow as an educator. The research in this area shows the
impact proper support can have on the retention of teachers
in special education. As the shortage continues to grow,
school districts and educational agencies must begin to focus
more of their attention on the recruitment and retention of
special education teachers. This begins by identifying teach-
ers who are more likely to stay in the field and providing
them with the proper support and opportunities for growth.
The districts and agencies should take heed of the current
research calling for more overall support and guidance for
new special educators. When more support is provided for
these teachers, the amount of special educators remaining in
the field will begin to increase, and the gap between the
amount of special educators and the number of openings in
the field will begin to decline.
