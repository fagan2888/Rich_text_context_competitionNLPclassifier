Donald Trump's presidential candidacy and election vic-
tory was both unexpected and unusual. He has no experi-
ence in elected office, a brash style, and policy positions
that often diverge from those traditionally espoused by
Republicans (e.g. on Social Security and Medicare).
Scholars have attempted to explain the basis of support for
Trump as a product of feelings of economic anxiety, the
growing populism of the Republican Party (with a focus on
anti-immigrant sentiment), sexism, and authoritarianism
(e.g., MacWilliams, 2016; Rahn and Oliver, 2016; Schaffner
et al., 2017; Sides and Farrell, 2016; Wayne et al., 2016).
Perhaps most important, analysts have focused on Trump's
appeal to white Americans who harbor animosity toward
"undeserving" racial minorities. Trump's lack of support
among people of color and his popularity among white sub-
groups with less tolerant attitudes (such as whites without
college degrees) provide suggestive evidence that support
for his candidacy was rooted in racial hostility. Moreover,
Trump's call for law and order in the context of discussing
urban unrest--to give just one example--is reminiscent of
previous racial appeals in American politics, including
George HW Bush's Willie Horton ad (Mendelberg, 2001)
and Richard Nixon's "Southern strategy" (Hillygus and
Shields, 2008). More diagnostic still are studies showing
that variables measuring white in-group favoritism and
those measuring bias against racial and ethnic out-groups
strongly correlate with support for Trump (e.g., Cohen
et al., 2016; Gest, 2016; Nteta and Schaffner, 2016;
Schaffner et al., 2017; Tesler, 2015, 2016a; Wood, 2017).
While previous work has shown that racial attitudes pre-
dict support for Donald Trump, no studies that we are aware
of have examined whether attitudes toward Trump moder-
ate the political impact of racial cues in the environment. In
this research note, we examine whether such effects are
heterogeneous, and whether heterogeneity stems from eval-
uations of Donald Trump as he sought to win the 2016
presidential election. To do so, we directly examine the

Abstract
A number of recent studies suggest that individuals who exhibit high levels of racial animosity strongly support Donald
Trump, while racial liberals strongly oppose him. This paper provides a new experimental analysis of the extent to
which supporters and opponents of Trump respond differently to race-related stimuli. Specifically, we examine whether
attitudes toward Trump moderate the political impact of racial cues in the environment. We find that white Trump
supporters randomly exposed to a black (versus a white) man in the context of soliciting their support for a housing-
assistance policy were more opposed to the policy, angrier about the policy, and more likely to blame beneficiaries for
their situation. The opposite pattern prevailed among whites with unfavorable opinions of Trump. Our results help
provide new insight into how Trump supporters and opponents differ in their responses to the salience of race in
American politics.

question of whether Trump supporters and opponents
exhibit distinct reactions to racial cues in the environment.
Given the unusually racialized nature of Trump's campaign
appeals and the resulting differences between Trump sup-
porters and opponents in racial attitudes, we argue that the
policy judgments of Trump supporters and opponents will
be influenced in divergent ways by cues that make black
Americans salient.
Our study addresses this racial-cueing hypothesis in a
novel survey experiment. Specifically, we randomly
assign respondents to view a subtle image of either a black
or a white man in the context of soliciting attitudes toward
a housing-assistance policy. As a social welfare issue, atti-
tudes toward government housing assistance tap into per-
ceptions of deservingness that many see as central to the
growing populism of the Republican Party, and upon
which Donald Trump based his candidacy (e.g., Cramer,
2016; Gest, 2016; Tesler, 2016b). By examining the effect
of racial cues on attitudes toward housing assistance, our
study allows for an examination of whether attitudes
related to perceptions of deservingness change upon
exposure to an image of a black versus a white man, and
whether this effect varies depending on one's level of sup-
port for Donald Trump. To the extent that Trump support-
ers and opponents differ in how they respond to racial
cues, we hypothesize that:
Hypothesis 1: for Trump supporters, subtle presentation
of a black racial cue--versus a white racial cue--will (a)
decrease support for government housing assistance, (b)
increase anger that some people receive government
assistance, and (c) increase the belief that individuals
are to blame for their situation.
We also hypothesize that Trump opponents will have the
opposite reaction. Consistent with Tesler and Sears (2010)
and Tesler's (2016c) finding of "two-sided" racialization in
evaluations of President Obama (such that racially sympa-
thetic whites held more favorable evaluations of Obama
than previous Democratic candidates, and that racially
resentful whites held more negative evaluations of Obama
than previous Democrats), we hypothesize that:
Hypothesis 2: for Trump opponents, the presence of a
black (versus a white) racial cue will (a) increase sup-
port for government housing assistance, (b) decrease
anger towards people receiving government assistance,
and (c) decrease their belief that individuals are to blame
for their situation.
Finally, we examine whether it was Donald Trump
alone--and not also Hillary Clinton--whose candidacy
divided the electorate on the basis of responsiveness to
racial cues. Given his clear racial and ethno-nationalist
appeals--for example, about President Obama's country of
origin, his support for a Muslim ban, the state of theAfrican
American community, and negative comments about
Mexicans--Trump is similar to other explicitly ethnocen-
tric white candidates who appealed to individuals high in
racial resentment, such as Pat Buchanan (e.g., Sears et al.,
1997). Thus, we expect that responsiveness to racial cues
will vary as a function of feelings about Trump, but not
feelings about Clinton. Finally, we examine the robustness
of our findings by examining whether traditional political
predispositions--partisanship and ideology--can account
for our Trump-moderated experimental findings.
In short, we examine whether Trump supporters and
opponents exhibit distinct reactions to experimentally pro-
vided racial cues when forming attitudes related to social
welfare and deservingness, and whether racial appeals can
work to further polarize Trump supporters from opponents.
We find strong support for both hypotheses; moreover, we
find that the impact of racial cues varies solely as a function
of feelings about Donald Trump--and not feelings about
his Democratic opponent, partisanship, or ideology. In sum,
we provide causal evidence that when racial cues are sali-
ent in the environment, Trump supporters and opponents
have fundamentally different reactions and become even
more divided.
Data and methods
To provide a test of the theory that racial cues increase atti-
tude polarization between Trump supporters and oppo-
nents, we conducted an experiment using a national sample
of 2020 respondents who completed the first two waves of
an Internet panel study. The data were collected through
Survey Sampling International. Of the respondents who
completed Wave 2, 964 were randomly assigned to receive
the stimuli for the current experiment.1 Given the very low
support for Donald Trump among African Americans,
Asian Americans, and Latinx, our analyses include only the
white respondents who completed the experiment; this pro-
duced a final sample of n = 746. Details about the study
sample can be found in Appendix A, and details about the
stimuli and measures can be found in Appendix B.
Experimental stimuli and dependent variables
To examine the influence of racial cues, our experiment
measured support for a federal mortgage-assistance pro-
gram in the presence of either a black or a white racial cue,
signaled by the presence of a black man (n = 370) or a white
man (n = 376) standing next to a foreclosure sign.
As Figure 1 shows, the activation of racial categories
was subtle; no attention was called to the photo, and neither
the instructions nor the dependent measures made any ref-
erence to the individual depicted in the photo. Respondents
were randomly assigned to either the black or white photo
condition. The experiment was introduced with brief text
Luttig et al. 3
and was accompanied by a photo of a foreclosed home and
the black or white target individual. The introductory text
read: "Recently there have been proposals to help people
who are struggling with their mortgages and may lose their
homes." Participants then indicated their support for the
mortgage-relief program, whether the possibility of such
help made them angry, and the extent to which they blamed
potential beneficiaries of the program for their own pre-
dicament. Responses to these items served as the dependent
variables and were rescaled to run from 0 to 1, with higher
scores indicating greater policy opposition (M = 0.52,
standard deviation (SD = 0.30), greater anger (M = 0.40,
SD = 0.32), and greater individual blame (M = 0.56, SD =
0.28). We find no direct treatment effects of the white ver-
sus black racial cue on these dependent variables: policy
opposition (b = 0.01, p > 0.10), anger (b = 0.01, p > 0.10),
and individual blame (b = -0.01, p > 0.10).3
To establish that our experimental treatment did, how-
ever, polarize respondents on the basis of racial attitudes,
we estimated a series of models interacting treatment
assignment with racial resentment, ethnocentrism, and per-
ceptions of white disadvantage (along with control varia-
bles). These results show that our manipulation of race did
lead to distinct reactions among racial liberals and conserv-
atives, as measured by multiple indicators of racial bias
(see online Appendix Tables A2 to A4).
Independent variables
Besides a dummy variable for experimental condition, we
include the following independent variables (unless indi-
cated, all were measured in Wave 1 and rescaled to run from
0 to 1). Trump favorability was assessed using repeated
feeling-thermometer ratings from Waves 1 and 2 of the sur-
vey; these items correlated highly (Pearson's r = 0.80), so
they were averaged (M = 0.42, SD = 0.36).2 Clinton favora-
bility was similarly assessed with repeated feeling thermom-
eters from Waves 1 and 2 (r = 0.79, M = 0.39, SD = 0.36).
We control for basic demographics: age (left in its original
metric), income (rescaled to run 0 to 1), sex, education
(seven ordered categories, rescaled to run 0 to 1), and
employment status (1 = unemployed). However, we note
that the results are not substantially changed when no con-
trol variables whatsoever are included (see online Appendix
Table A1).
Results
To test whether the effects of racial cues varied directly as
a function of white respondents' opinions of Donald
Trump, we estimated a series of ordinary-least squares
regression models. Each dependent variable was regressed
on Trump favorability, a dummy variable representing cue
condition (0 = white, 1 = black), and the interaction
between the two, along with the aforementioned controls.
We also compare the extent to which responses to racial
cues differed as a function of Trump favorability--as
opposed to Clinton favorability--during the 2016 presi-
dential election by including an additional interaction
between cue condition and our measure of Clinton favora-
bility. To guard against heteroscedasticity, HC3 robust
standard errors were used in all analyses (Long and Ervin,
2000). The results are summarized in Table 1.
In each model, the coefficient for the Trump Favorability
× Racial Cue interaction provides the critical test of our
hypothesis that attitudes toward Donald Trump moderate
the impact of racial cues on political judgment. This interac-
tion is significant and correctly signed for all three depend-
ent variables: opposition to mortgage assistance (b = 0.20, p
< 0.01), anger about assistance (b = 0.27, p < 0.001), and
blaming targets of the assistance for their own situation (b =
0.21, p < 0.01). By contrast, attitudes toward Hillary Clinton
failed to moderate the impact of the racial cues for any of the
dependent variables (i.e., the interaction between Clinton
favorability and cue condition fails to reach significance in
any of the models). Furthermore, tests constraining the two
coefficients to equality indicated that the coefficient for the
interaction between Trump favorability and the racial cue is
Figure 1. Stimuli from the racial-cue conditions: (a) white
condition. (b) black condition.
4 Research and Politics 
significantly stronger than the coefficient for the interaction
between Clinton favorability and the racial cue for anger
(p < 0.05) and individual blame (p < 0.10), and marginally
stronger for opposing mortgage assistance (p < 0.10, one-
tailed). These findings indicate that responses to the racial
cue varied as a function of feelings about Donald Trump--
but not feelings about Hillary Clinton--during the 2016
presidential election.4
To unpack these interactions, we estimated conditional
effects for the racial-cue manipulation across the full range
of Trump favorability values from the most negative evalu-
ation (0) to the most positive (1). These conditional-effect
estimates are plotted in Figure 2; values on the y-axis rep-
resent the effect estimates and can be interpreted as the pro-
portion change in each dependent variable associated with
moving from the white-cue condition to the black-cue con-
dition. For the mortgage help policy question, opposition
was greater in the black condition than the white condition
when Trump evaluations were at their most favorable, b =
0.13 (standard error (SE) = 0.05, p < 0.05), and lower in the
black versus the white condition when Trump evaluations
were at their least favorable, b = -0.07 (SE = 0.04, p <
0.10). Similarly, for the anger rating, anger was higher in
the black than the white condition when Trump favorability
was at its maximum, b = 0.17 (SE = 0.05, p < 0.01); but
lower in the black condition than in the white condition
when Trump favorability was at its minimum, b = -0.09
(SE = 0.04, p < 0.05). Finally, with respect to the blame
variable, respondents were more likely to blame beneficiar-
ies for their own plight in the black condition compared to
the white condition when Trump evaluations were at their
most favorable, b = 0.12 (SE = 0.05, p < 0.05); but less
likely to do so in the black versus the white condition when
Trump evaluations were at their least favorable, b = -0.10
(SE = 0.04, p < 0.05). In sum, this pattern of results sup-
ports both hypotheses 1 and 2.
Figure 3 presents the conditional-effect estimates--
moving from the white to the black racial cue on all three
dependent variables--across levels of support for Hillary
Clinton. As Figure 3 shows, at no level of Clinton support
does cue condition affect support for government housing,
anger at beneficiaries, or blaming beneficiaries for their

situation. Thus, it is support for Donald Trump--not Hillary
Clinton--that captures differences in reaction to racial cues
in the environment.
Robustness analyses. Does support for Donald Trump
uniquely capture distinct reactions to our cue manipula-
tion, or does this pattern of polarization simply reflect the
deep-seated partisan and ideological divide in American
politics? In Table 2, we present a model in which we also
interact our experimental treatment with partisanship and
ideology, two other central predispositions related to
Trump support. Our results are highly similar with these
interactions included.5 Support for Donald Trump--not
partisanship or ideology--uniquely captures distinct reac-
tions to our experimental manipulation of race (i.e. neither
the partisanship-by-race-cue manipulation nor the ideol-
ogy-by-race-cue manipulation is significant).6 This indi-
cates that Trump support is not merely a proxy for
long-standing ideological and partisan divides in respon-
siveness to racial cues. That is, support for Donald Trump
appears to serve as a basis for polarized responses to racial
cues in its own regard.
Finally, we examine feelings about Donald Trump as a
moderator of our racial manipulation while controlling for
the interaction between the experimental manipulation and

racial resentment, ethnocentrism, and perceptions of white
disadvantage. Because these racial attitudes measures are
highly correlated, we analyze these results with each racial
attitude measure included separately (to protect against
multicollinearity). The results are presented in the online
Appendix Tables A6 to A8. We find that the Trump
Favorability × Racial Cue interaction continues to be sig-
nificant in each of these analyses. Moreover, in each case,
the interaction involving the racial attitude variable and the
cue manipulation is reduced in significance. What are we to
make of these findings? In our view, they suggest that feel-
ings about Donald Trump mediate the effect of racial atti-
tudes in response to racial cues in the environment. That is,
Trump supporters and opponents may respond differently
to racial cues because of prior differences in racial attitudes.
Because they are learned early in childhood and adoles-
cence (Sears, 1993), racial attitudes should be exogenous to
attitudes toward Donald Trump--who was a novel (but
racialized and highly salient) political stimulus in the con-
text of the 2016 election. Therefore, attitudes toward Trump
most likely serve as a proximal variable--in the sense of
coloring other political judgments--in conveying the
impact of racial attitudes on downstream political judg-
ments. In sum, these results continue to show that feelings
about Donald Trump directly capture a distinct and highly
salient expression of differences between racial liberals and
conservatives, as indicated by their polarized response to
our subtle experimental manipulation of race.

Discussion and conclusion
Across all three dependent variables, our hypotheses
received clear support. Among citizens with favorable
views of Donald Trump, black racial cues increased oppo-
sition to mortgage assistance, anger at such assistance, and
the tendency to blame policy targets for their own plight. In
contrast, among citizens with unfavorable views of Donald
Trump, black racial cues had the opposite effect: decreased
opposition to mortgage assistance, anger, and individual
blame. Importantly, these effects were exclusive to atti-
tudes toward Trump: effects of the racial cue did not differ
according to feelings about Hillary Clinton. Thus, Trump
supporters and opponents respond in fundamentally differ-
ent ways to racial cues in the environment.
These findings underscore the extent to which supporters
and opponents of Donald Trump respond in a polarized fash-
ion to the salience of racial cues. These distinct dynamics of
racialization suggest that when race becomes salient in pub-
lic discourse, support for Donald Trump will serve as a ful-
crum for divergent policy judgments. Thus, to the extent that
race-related issues remain at the top of the public agenda,
supporters and opponents of Donald Trump are likely to
become even more divided in their policy judgments, emo-
tional reactions to policy proposals, and perceptions of social
groups that are likely to be helped (or hurt) by various poli-
cies. Together with recent findings suggesting that racial atti-
tudes are a key correlate of evaluations of Donald Trump
(e.g., Tesler, 2016a, 2016b), our findings serve to underscore
the continuing centrality of race as a contributor to polariza-
tion in American political life. In this regard, we join other
analysts (e.g., Tesler, 2016c) in doubting that the develop-
ments of the present era--as momentous as they are--have
truly brought about a "post-racial" America.
We conclude with a few suggestions for future research.
First, our study merely establishes that going from white to
black racial cues produces fundamentally distinct reactions
among Trump supporters and opponents in their support for
government housing assistance, anger about said assis-
tance, and blaming individuals for their struggles. However,
it cannot determine whether Trump supporters and oppo-
nents are differentially reacting primarily to the white or
black racial-cue condition (or both). This is an important
distinction that future work should investigate by examin-
ing reactions to black cues and white cues relative to an
additional non-racialized control condition. Second, future
research should examine the effect of racial cues in the con-
text of policies Trump has expressed more support for. For
example, Trump--in contrast to other Republicans--prom-
ised to preserve Medicaid during the 2016 campaign. Thus,
it would be interesting to see whether cues implying that
this program benefited disliked outgroups were as effective
in reducing support among Trump supporters. A result of
this sort would suggest that the identity-based antecedents
of Trump support may be capable of turning his voters
against even those policies he has clearly endorsed. These
and other questions await examination.

Notes
1. Random assignment appears to have been successful, as we
find no significant differences across the black and white
treatment conditions in terms of age, income, gender, educa-
tion, employment status, Trump favorability, Clinton favora-
bility, ideology, or partisanship.
2. Results were identical when using three alternate indices
of Trump support: (a) a dummy variable indicating that the
respondent intended to vote for Trump (vs. Clinton) in a cat-
egorical candidate-choice question from Wave 2 (available
in online Appendix Table A5); (b) a favorability measure
based only on the Trump thermometer from Wave 1; (c) a
favorability measure based only on the Trump thermometer
from Wave 2 (these latter two results available upon request).
3. We refer to the  coefficient as b here and throughout the
paper.
4. Results are identical when modeling the interaction between
cue condition and Trump and Clinton favorability sepa-
rately. In that analysis, the Trump × Cue Condition interac-
tion is correctly signed and statistically significant, while the
Clinton × Cue Condition interaction is not statistically sig-
nificant (available upon request).
5. We once again find in this analysis that the coefficient for
the interaction between Trump favorability and the racial cue
is significantly stronger than the coefficient for the interac-
tion between Clinton favorability and the racial cue for anger
(p < 0.05) and individual blame (p < 0.10), but in this case
not for opposing mortgage assistance.
6. The one exception is a marginally significant and negative
interaction between partisanship and the racial cue on indi-
vidual blame.
