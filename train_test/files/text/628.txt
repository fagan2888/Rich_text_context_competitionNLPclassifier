Objective: Leading causes of fatal and non-fatal injury among US children aged <15 years were
compared.
Method: A descriptive study was conducted using nationally representative data on injury related
deaths (National Vital Statistics System) and on non-fatal injury related emergency department visits
(IEDV; National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program). Data were accessed using a
publicly available web based system.
Results: Annually, an estimated 7 100 000 pediatric IEDV and 7400 injury deaths occurred. The
overall non-fatal to fatal ratio (NF:F) was 966 IEDV:1 death. Among deaths, the leading causes were
motor vehicle traffic occupants (n = 1700; NF:F = 150:1), suffocations (n = 1037; NF:F = 14:1), and
drownings (n = 971, NF:F = 6:1). Among non-fatal injuries, falls (estimated 2 400 000) and struck
by/against (estimated 1 800 000) were the most common causes, but substantially less lethal (NF:F =
19 000:1 and 15 000:1, respectively).
Conclusions: The leading causes of pediatric fatal and non-fatal injuries differed substantially. This
study indicates the need for consideration of common causes of non-fatal injury, especially falls.
The high number of deaths from injury among US children
has been a major factor in prioritizing injury as a public
health problem. While injuries are the leading cause of
death among US children between 1 and 14 years of age,1
these deaths only represent a small fraction of those injured.2
Injury accounts for one third of all emergency department
visits among children younger than 15 years, making injury
the leading cause of emergency department visits in this age
group.3 The distribution by cause of non-fatal injuries has not
received the same consideration as that of fatalities when set-
ting public health priorities for research and programs.
Currently available fatal and non-fatal injury data from
nationally representative surveillance systems can now
enhance our ability to consider both. This study compared the
leading causes of fatal and non-fatal injury among children in
the US.
METHODS
Data were obtained from the Web based Injury Statistics and
Query System (WISQARS), a Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) web based interactive platform recently
enhanced to include non-fatal injuries (http://www.cdc.gov/
ncipc/wisqars). WISQARS allows for querying by age,
race/ethnicity, sex, state (fatal data only), year, injury cause,
injury intent, and disposition at emergency department
discharge (non-fatal data only). National mortality data from
1999 (the latest reporting year available) were based on the
National Vital Statistics System of the National Center for
Health Statistics, CDC.4 Annual non-fatal national estimates
of hospital emergency department visits were based on the
National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury
Program (NEISS-AIP), which is a probability sample rep-
resentative of US emergency departments for the first 12
months of available data, July 2000 through June 2001.5­8
NEISS-AIP is a collaborative effort between the National
Center for Injury Prevention and Control, CDC and the US
Consumer Product Safety Commission.
We reviewed data for children younger than 15 years of age
to determine the leading causes of fatal and non-fatal injury,
regardless of intent. For each cause, we assessed cause specific
lethality by computing the ratio of non-fatal injuries
(expressed as injury related emergency department visits;
IEDV) to the number of deaths (non-fatal to fatal ratio, NF:F).
Age specific mortality rates were calculated using 1999 US
Census Bureau population estimates. Non-fatal injury rates
were calculated using the average US Census Bureau popula-
tion estimates for 2000 and 2001, since the non-fatal data
spanned two calendar years. Coefficients of variations and
95% confidence intervals around national estimates of
numbers and rates were calculated using a direct variance
estimation procedure that accounts for sample weights and
the stratified sample design.7
RESULTS
The 58.6 million US children younger than 15 years of age
accounted for an estimated 7.1 million IEDV (95% confidence
interval 6.0 to 8.3 million) and 7365 injury deaths during a 12
month period. This resulted in an overall NF:F of 966 IEDV:1
death.
The leading causes of pediatric fatalities and non-fatal IEDV
differed substantially (table 1). Among injury related fatali-
ties, those related to motor vehicle traffic occupant deaths,
inhalation/suffocations, and drownings accounted for 50% of
all deaths. The respective NF:F for motor vehicle traffic occu-
pants and suffocations were 150:1 and 14:1. Drownings
accounted for 971 deaths and was the most lethal cause (NF:F
= 6:1). Among non-fatal injuries, falls were the leading cause,
with more than 2.4 million IEDVs. This was almost 40% higher

than the second leading cause, struck by/against (1.8 million
IEDVs); however, these two causes were substantially less
lethal, with NF:F = 19 000:1 and 15 000:1, respectively. Over-
exertion accounted for 448 000 IEDVs, but was not associated
with any deaths.
Transportation related injuries, which included injuries to
motor vehicle traffic occupants, pedal cyclists (principally
bicyclists), and pedestrians, were an important cause of pedi-
atric injury morbidity and mortality. In this age group,
non-fatal pedal cycle injuries resulted in about 25% more
IEDV than motor vehicle occupant injuries. Pedestrian injuries
were the most lethal transportation cause (NF:F = 67:1).
Injury mortality rates and IEDV rates varied by age and
cause (tables 2 and 3). Motor vehicle traffic occupant mortality
rates were highest for infants and 14 year olds. Infants
younger than 1 year and, to a lesser degree, children older than
13 years had high suffocation fatality rates. Drowning and
pedestrian mortality rates were highest for children between 1
and 2 years of age. IEDV rates for falls were highest among
children between 1 and 2 years of age. Struck by/against IEDV
rates were highest among children between 1 and 3 years old,
and after 11 years of age, it was the leading cause of IEDV. In
contrast, overexertion IEDV rates generally increased with
age. Among transportation related causes, motor vehicle

occupant IEDV rates increased with age, while the pedal cycle
IEDV rate was highest in those between 9 and 12 years.
DISCUSSION
This study indicated that for every pediatric injury related
death approximately 1000 injured children received emer-
gency department treatment. Stated in other terms, about
0.1% of children died from their injuries. Rates of IEDV and
injury related mortality varied by cause of injury and age.
This study found that the large number of injuries caused
by falls, struck by/against, and overexertion accounted for
more than 60% of all pediatric IEDV, yet were rarely fatal. Fall
injury rates were highest among infants who are vulnerable
because of their limited coordination, exploratory nature, and
potential home hazards, while struck by/against and overexer-
tion injury rates were most pronounced in older children who
tend to be more active and involved in sports.
Results from this analysis were comparable to those gener-
ated by other databases. While NEISS-AIP estimated that
children younger than 15 years of age account for 7.1 million
IEDV, data from the 1999 National Hospital Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) estimated this as 8.2
million,9 10 a 13% difference. The NHAMCS estimate would be
expected to be higher because it includes repeat emergency
department visits for the same injury incident and it includes
cases where the reason for the visit was an injury as well as
those with injury diagnoses, while the NEISS-AIP estimate
includes only the initial emergency department visit for an
injury incident and only those cases with injury diagnoses as
determined by an attending physician. The other major
surveillance systems available for comparing injuries and
deaths relate to traffic crashes. The National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration tallies traffic related fatalities using the
Fatality Analysis Reporting System and estimates non-fatal
traffic related injuries using the National Automotive Sam-
pling System General Estimates System (GES). Compared
with our results, the NF:F ratios generated by these systems
were similar for motor vehicle traffic occupants, but substan-
tially different for pedal cyclists and pedestrians. These differ-
ences are attributable to discrepancies in non-fatal injury
data. Fatality Analysis Reporting System results are similar to
the vital statistics fatality data11; however, the NEISS-AIP cap-
ture of non-fatal transportation injuries is more complete
than GES. GES is based on police incident reports and
includes only those crashes that occur in traffic and that are
reported to the police. Compared with GES,12 NEISS-AIP
records 7.1% more injured motor vehicle occupants, 60% more
traffic related pedestrians injured, and over four times more
traffic related pedal cyclists injured.
The fatal and non-fatal injury related databases used in our
analysis provide timely data for the injury pyramid. These
databases can be used to indicate the annual incidence of the
top three levels of the injury pyramid, namely deaths,
hospitalizations, and emergency department visits. These
databases cannot be used to indicate the bottom level of the
pyramid: total episodes of injuries (including those un-
treated). Hospitalization estimates can be determined from
the emergency department disposition field; however, with
the 12 months of data for this analysis, we did not address the
issue of hospitalizations because the estimates can be unstable
for less common injuries. A more detailed analyses of
hospitalizations by external cause and intent of injury will be
possible as more years of NEISS-AIP data become available.
This study has several limitations. First, the injuries
included only those treated in hospital emergency depart-
ments; injuries that were treated in outpatient clinics or doc-
tors' offices, or not medically treated were not included.
Second, the NEISS-AIP provides only national estimates and
does not allow for estimates by region, state, or local jurisdic-
tion. Third, non-fatal causes were based on International Classi-
fication of Diseases (ICD)-9 codes,8 12 13 while fatal data were
based on ICD-10 codes.14 ICD-10 is more detailed, with 3000
more categories for all causes of death, and some of the rules
for coding and for selecting the underlying cause of death have
been changed to favor case ascertainment of injury.15 However,
when analyzing the ICD-9 based 1998 mortality data, there
were only minor differences in injury cause rankings and
rates. Finally, these mortality and morbidity data were
compared for different time periods. However, given the mag-
nitude of these findings, our results would not likely differ if
the same year of data had been available for both fatal and
non-fatal injuries.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PREVENTION
Public health policy has been largely influenced by mortality
data. New nationally based interactive databases now permit
public health professionals to fully consider the importance of
non-fatal injuries in developing priorities.
While our study indicated that falls constitute a large
proportion of non-fatal injuries among children, causal factors

Key points
· Although less devastating than deaths, non-fatal injuries
occurred much more frequently, and their leading causes
differed. For every pediatric injury death, approximately
1000 injured children received emergency department
treatment.
· Among children, the leading causes of fatal injuries differed
from leading causes of non-fatal injuries, indicating the
need to consider causes of non-fatal injuries when
prioritizing public health research and programs.
· Falls accounted for over 2.4 million pediatric emergency
department visits and struck by/against accounted for 1.8
million pediatric emergency department visits each year.
Further study into the etiologic factors is warranted to iden-
tify areas amenable to preventive measures.
