Self-report inventories of irrational beliefs identified and tar-
geted by Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) prac-
titioners are potentially invaluable in clinical assessment for
initial problem formulation and monitoring the effects of
treatment, provided that they possess adequate psychometric
properties (Malouff, 2009; Terjesen, Salhany, & Sciutto,
2009). Reviewers have argued that the continued develop-
ment of psychometrically sound inventories of irrational
beliefs is essential to advancing research and practice in the
field (McDermut & Haaga, 2009). Contemporary inventories
draw from current REBT theory in assessing both unhelpful
thought processes, such as "awfulizing," and irrational
themes or thought content, such as exaggerated preoccupa-
tions with a need for approval from others (Bernard, 1998;
Macavei & McMahon, 2010).
The General Attitude and Belief Scale
(GABS)
The GABS (Burgess, 1986; DiGiuseppe, Leaf, Exner, &
Robin, 1988) reflects current REBT theory, and its psycho-
metric status has continued to improve as researchers have
developed newer iterations of the test and its subscales to
produce greater internal consistency and a less ambiguous
factor structure (Bernard, 1998; Bridges & Harnish, 2010;
Lindner, Kirkby, Wertheim, & Birch, 1999; Shaw, 1989).
The GABS and an abbreviated version, the Shortened
General Attitude and Belief Scale (SGABS; Lindner et al.,
1999), both appear in a list of the six "most valid, up-to-date,
and widely used self-report instruments for measuring irra-
tional and rational beliefs in adults" (Macavei & McMahon,
2010, p. 118). The GABS is of particular interest because of
its structure--its items do not conflate cognition and emo-
tion; there are separate scales for rational and irrational
beliefs, and both cognitive processes and thought content are
integral to the instrument's items (Davies, 2008; Macavei &
McMahon, 2010).
The GABS includes the subscales Rationality, Self-
Downing, Need for Achievement, Need for Approval, Need
for Comfort, Demands for Fairness, and Other-Downing. It

Abstract
Accurate measurement of key constructs is essential to the continued development of Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy
(REBT). The General Attitude and Belief Scale (GABS), a contemporary inventory of rational and irrational beliefs based
on current REBT theory, is one of the most valid and widely used instruments available, and recent research has continued
to improve its psychometric standing. In this study of 544 students, item response theory (IRT) methods were used (a)
to identify the most informative item in each irrational subscale of the GABS, (b) to determine the level of irrationality
represented by each of those items, and (c) to suggest a condensed form of the GABS for further study with clinical
populations. Administering only the most psychometrically informative items to clients could result in economies of time and
effort. Further research based on the scaling of items could clarify the specific patterns of irrational beliefs associated with
particular clinical syndromes.

has been shown to demonstrate satisfactory internal consis-
tency as well as discriminant and construct validity, correlat-
ing strongly with inventories of commonly presented mental
health problems and distinguishing clinical from nonclinical
respondents (Davies, 2008; Lindner et al., 1999; Macavei &
McMahon, 2010; Wertheim & Poulakis, 1992).
Rationale for the Present Study
Study Objectives
The aims of this study were to evaluate the GABS using the
methodology of item response theory (IRT), and in the pro-
cess (a) to identify the most informative item in each irratio-
nal subscale of the GABS, (b) to determine the level of
irrationality represented by each of those items, and (c) to
suggest a condensed form of the irrational subscales of the
GABS for further evaluation.
With its 9 items, the Rationality subscale of the GABS
can stand alone as a convenient measure of that construct,
and it is not considered in detail in this article. The 46 items
of the irrational subscales are the focus of attention as the
possibility of abbreviating this large section of the GABS,
without loss of information, could increase the convenience
of use in clinical settings. Also, as shown in the following
review, the irrational statements in beliefs inventories gener-
ally show greater discriminant validity than rational state-
ments in differentiating nonclinical from clinical samples.
Evaluating the GABS using IRT methods (Baker, 2001;
DeMars, 2010; Embretson & Reise, 2000) can reveal which
test items are the most discriminating and informative, can
assess the utility of the Likert-type scale response format for
each item, and can scale critical test items for the level of
irrationality they represent. There has been no clear consen-
sus among clinicians or researchers about the hierarchical
structure of irrational beliefs (DiGiuseppe, 1996), and dis-
agreement persists (David, Lynn, & Ellis, 2010). Identifying
and scaling the most psychometrically sound items in the
GABS could be constructive in revealing the irrationality
levels of specific unhelpful beliefs and in focusing the assess-
ment process.
Previous research on various measures of irrational beliefs
suggests that some irrational content areas are more valid
than others in discriminating clinical from general popula-
tion samples. For example, on the Common Beliefs Survey
(Bessai & Lane, 1976), psychiatric inpatients showed sig-
nificantly higher scores than hospital staff members and stu-
dents on a self-downing subscale, and inpatients had
significantly higher scores than mental health outpatients
and the nonclinical samples on perfectionism, whereas there
were no differences between these samples on such other
scales as need for approval or blame-proneness (Thorpe,
Parker, & Barnes, 1992). On another inventory, a subscale on
rational thoughts or self-statements did not differentiate cli-
ents from students, whereas significant group differences
were seen in subscales on irrational thought content (Thorpe,
Barnes, Hunter, & Hines, 1983). On the GABS, maritally
distressed couples scored higher on Self-Downing and Need
for Comfort than nondistressed couples, and distressed cou-
ples receiving counseling also had higher scores on Need for
Approval than those not receiving counseling (Addis &
Bernard, 2002).
Such findings do not directly address the possibility that,
independent of the sample under study, some beliefs may be
more irrational than others--in the sense that making global
ratings of oneself and others, for example, may indicate a
more extreme position on the implied general trait of irratio-
nality than, say, unrealistic demands for fairness.
Processes and Themes in Assessing Irrational
Beliefs
Essential to contemporary REBT theory is a set of four eval-
uative irrational beliefs: "demands, awfulizing, low frustra-
tion tolerance, and global evaluations of human worth"
(Walen, DiGiuseppe, & Dryden, 1992, p. 17), all four of
which are assessed by items (though not necessarily sub-
scales) in the GABS. There is disagreement on their relative
importance (O'Kelly, Joyce, & Greaves, 1998). The primacy
of demandingness (thinking in terms of "shoulds," "oughts,"
and "musts") was cited in many early writings, but factor
analytic research on the original GABS items failed to sup-
port this (DiGiuseppe, 1996; DiGiuseppe et al., 1988), and
there are conceptual and measurement difficulties
(DiGiuseppe, 1996; O'Kelly et al., 1998). Instead, low frus-
tration tolerance and self-downing have emerged as more
fundamental constructs. Improvements on ratings of those
constructs following parent education interventions were
associated with beneficial change on emotional measures
(O'Kelly et al., 1998), and in psychometric research on the
GABS, self-downing was the only evaluative belief category
to appear as a distinct single factor (DiGiuseppe et al., 1988).
Davies (2008) has reported that the GABS subscales Self-
Downing, Need for Achievement, and Need for Approval are
all strongly and negatively correlated with unconditional
self-acceptance.
Davies (2008) has noted that the GABS takes account of
the four evaluative beliefs or irrational thinking processes
(demandingness, awfulizing, low frustration tolerance, and
self-downing) as well as the four content domains or themes
(needs for achievement, approval, and comfort, and demands
for fairness). Arguing that each irrational belief includes
both a process and a theme, he pointed out that such combi-
nations are represented in all 46 irrational GABS items. For
example, GABS Item 35 ("It's awful to have hassles in one's
life and it is a catastrophe to be hassled") combines the
awfulizing process with the Need for Comfort theme or con-
tent area. Davies concluded that it is difficult at the present
state of knowledge to separate processes from themes in
Owings et al. 3
irrational beliefs inventories. Accordingly, the focus of this
study is on representative items drawn from the irrational
subscales of the GABS, each item representing a process/
theme combination.
In this study of the GABS, the most representative items
from each of the irrational subscales as identified by Bernard
(1998), and from each of the processes and themes noted by
Davies (2008), were evaluated for their position on the broad
scale of irrationality in a convenience sample of student
respondents. The study was approved by the Protection of
Human Subjects Review Board at the University of Maine.
Method
Participants
The GABS was administered to 544 college students (393
female, 148 male, and 3 who did not indicate their gender)
taking courses in general psychology. They received course
credit for their participation. The mean age of the sample was
20.18 years (SD = 5.17).
Materials
The 55-item GABS described by Bernard (1998) was admin-
istered. The GABS consists of seven subscales: Rationality
(9 items), Self-Downing (9 items), Need for Achievement (9
items), Need for Approval (7 items), Need for Comfort (9
items), Demands for Fairness (9 items), and Other-Downing
(3 items). Respondents rate each item on a 5-point Likert-
type scale to indicate level of agreement (1 = strongly dis-
agree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly
agree). Agreement signals rationality for the 9 items of the
Rationality scale and irrationality for the 46 items of the
other six scales, which taken together form a Total
Irrationality scale. Additional questionnaires that were not
the focus of this article were administered to some of the
respondents together with the GABS.
IRT Methodology
The research protocol called for the use of IRT programs
suitable for analyzing data from Likert-type scales (Ostini &
Nering, 2006). Data were analyzed using the Graded
Response Models (GRM) in MULTILOG 7 (Thissen, Chen,
& Bock, 2003) and PARSCALE 4 (Muraki & Bock, 2003).
Models in IRT for analyzing dichotomous data (e.g., with
"true or false," "agree or disagree" response options) include
the two-parameter logistic (2PL) IRT model, which estimates
item discrimination (designated by a) and item location or
difficulty (designated by b) parameters for each item within
a test (du Toit, 2003; Kline, 2005). The 2PL program in
MULTILOG estimates each test respondent's trait level, des-
ignated as , from performance on all test items, then pro-
gresses through an iterative process in which the trait levels
of respondents and the item parameters are estimated pro-
gressively more precisely. Items with poor discrimination
(those that do not effectively differentiate respondents with
higher vs. lower trait levels) are automatically given low
weightings in estimating respondents' values (Baker, 2001;
Embretson & Reise, 2000).
MULTILOG and similar programs produce item charac-
teristic curves (ICCs) to depict the functioning of each
test item with respondents with varying levels of . In
MULTILOG, the x-axis of the ICC indicates increasing lev-
els of  from left to right on an arbitrary z-score metric
ranging from -3.00 to +3.00. The y-axis of the ICC indi-
cates the probability of a response to the item in the desig-
nated direction (e.g., a correct response to an item assessing
factual knowledge or agreement on an attitude survey
item). The trace line of the graph, modeled from an S-shaped
logistic function or growth curve, indicates the probabili-
ties with which respondents with varying trait levels will
endorse the correct response (or the response signifying
agreement). The difficulty level of an item is arbitrarily set
as the point on the x-axis at which the trace line crosses the
.5 probability value on the y-axis. Item information is
inversely related to the standard error of measurement; in
practice, highly discriminating items show high values for
information. This methodology is described in detail in
Thorpe and Favia (2012) and Thorpe et al. (2007).

tion curve as generated by the MULTILOG 2PL model pro-

7 in the Rationality subscale, scored by creating a false
dichotomy in which response options 1, 2, and 3 were
recoded as 1, and response options 4 and 5 were recoded as
2, so that 2 signified agreement with this "rational" item.
With a value for a = 1.73, Item 37 is very highly discriminat-
ing (Baker, 2001), as gauged by the steepness of the graph at
its midpoint; this item sharply separates respondents with
trait levels a little above and a little below the item's low
"difficulty" of b = -0.88. As this is an "easy" item, respon-
dents do not have to show a very high level of rationality to
register agreement.
Results
Original Irrational Subscales
Respondents' scores on the 46 items of the six irrational sub-
scales of the GABS were evaluated via the methodologies of
classical and modern test theory. In classical test theory,
obtaining high values for internal consistency in the items
within each subscale could help to justify selecting a single
item to represent each subscale. In IRT, establishing the uni-
dimensionality of the subscales is important; "a scale is uni-
dimensional when a single latent trait accounts for all the
common variance among item responses" (Morizot,
Ainsworth, & Reise, 2007, p. 413). The issue is "unidimen-
sional enough" (M. Linacre, personal communication, June
4, 2011). Suitable methods for assessing unidimensionality
include conducting an exploratory factor analysis (e.g., Funk
& Rogge, 2007) and inspecting factors'eigenvalues, the ratio
of the eigenvalue of the first factor to the second and subse-
quent factors, and the "knee" in scree slopes (Ruscio &
Roche, 2012). Turk et al. (2006) suggested "the use of factor
analysis to examine patterns of covariation among responses,
and if multidimensionality is found, then each factor can be
used as a unique scale if doing so would be consistent with
the overall theoretical approach" (p. 214).
Using these methods, identifying the most representative
item within each GABS subscale would allow further analy-
sis of those six items so as to reveal the relative levels of
irrationality that they represent.
Internal Consistency Analyses. Table 1 presents the results of
internal consistency analyses for each of the GABS sub-
scales. For the following subscales, none of the constituent
items, if deleted, would have resulted in an increase in the
value obtained for Cronbach's alpha as shown in Table 1:
Self-Downing, Need for Achievement, Need for Approval,
Need for Comfort, and Demands for Fairness. For the three-
item Other-Downing subscale, deleting GABS Item 18
would have increased the value marginally from  = .70 to
 = .71 (this relatively low value for alpha is directly attrib-
utable to the small number of items in this subscale).
The generally high degree of internal consistency shown
by the items within each subscale provided justification for
selecting the most representative item from each subscale for
further analysis.
Comparison of Subscale Scores Across Studies. Table 2 presents
the mean scores per item in our sample for each of the six
irrational subscales of the GABS. Also included in Table 2
are the corresponding data from four previous studies from
Australia and the United Kingdom published from 1992 to
2008. The degree of concordance in the ordinal rankings of
the six subscale scores in these five studies was high (Kend-
all's W = .873, k = 5, N = 6, p < .01). In fact, the studies
showed perfect concordance in ranking the mean subscale
item scores for Demands for Fairness, Need for Achieve-
ment, Need for Approval, and Self-Downing in that order
from highest to lowest.

Analyses Using IRT Methodology. The irrational subscales were
subjected to separate exploratory factor analyses (principal
components analyses) to assess the degree of unidimension-
ality. Self-Downing produced two factors, the first including
seven items and the second the remaining two. Need for
Achievement produced two factors, with six items in the first
and three in the second. The remaining four subscales--
Need for Approval, Need for Comfort, Demands for Fair-
ness, and Other-Downing--each produced a single factor
(only one component was extracted).
The GABS irrational subscales were evaluated separately
using the GRM in MULTILOG. The GRM is very similar to
the 2PL model, but it is a polytomous model that can accom-
modate the five Likert-type scale response options for each
test item. The ICCs from the GRM program provide a trace
line for each response option, as in Figure 3 (GABS Item 48,
from an analysis of a very brief test consisting of six items:
46, 35, 48, 30, 45, and 44, the most informative items from
each subscale, listed in order of increasing difficulty). For
each item, the printed output provides a value for slope (a,
equivalent to discrimination in the 2PL model) and four val-
ues for location (b1, b2, b3, and b4), the thresholds between
the five response options. Item information in the GRM
model is calculated from the value of the slope parameter
"and the spread of the category thresholds" (Embretson &
Reise, 2000, p. 185), such that higher values for information
are given with steeper slopes and when the between-category
threshold parameters for an item are distributed fairly evenly.
Within each subscale, the item with the highest value for
information was selected. The resulting six items form a very
brief scale for further study. A principal components analysis
of that scale led to only one factor being extracted. Table 3
presents the values for the slope and threshold parameters for
the six items selected to represent the subscales. The overall
location (or "difficulty") value for each item as estimated by
PARSCALE is also included. It can be seen from Table 3 that
the values for location range from +0.194 (Item 46, repre-
senting Demands for Fairness) to +1.999 (Item 44, Self-
Downing). Item 46 has the lowest value and is located at
approximately the midpoint of the x-axis on an ICC; this
item therefore functions among respondents with medium
trait levels for irrationality. Item 44 has the highest value and
is located toward the right on the x-axis; this item functions
among the respondents with the highest trait levels for irra-
tionality. The intervening four items have broadly similar
values for location and are most helpful in assessing respon-
dents with moderate trait levels. In the student respondents,
only those with the highest levels of irrationality endorsed a
Self-Downing item. However, even those with the lowest
trait levels often agreed with a Demands for Fairness item.

Processes and Themes
Davies (2008, Table 7, p. 115) provided a matrix that illus-
trated how particular GABS items could each be placed at
the intersection of one of the four irrational processes and
one of the four themes. Extending this matrix, we divided all
46 irrational items of the GABS into scales representing
either the irrational processes or the irrational themes. We
added the 3 items from the Other-Downing subscale to the 9
Self-Downing items to create a "global rating" scale of 12
items. Because the 3 Other-Downing items all combined the
elements of (a) damning other people because they (b) treat
one unfairly, these items were also added to the Demands for
Fairness subscale to create a 12-item theme "fairness."
Treating other items similarly led to two separate divisions
of the 46 irrational items in the GABS. One of these divided
the 46 items into four processes (demandingness, 12 items;
global rating, 12 items; low frustration tolerance, 12 items;
and awfulizing, 10 items), and the other divided the items
into four themes (achievement, 12 items; approval, 10 items;
comfort, 12 items; and fairness, 12 items).
Two raters, both advanced undergraduate research assis-
tants earning course credit, independently assigned each of
the 46 irrational GABS items to one of the four processes and
to one of the four themes, and their agreement was assessed
by kappa coefficients (processes:  = .942; themes:  = .884).
Those kappa values represent "almost perfect agreement"
(Elder, Pavalko, & Clipp, 1993, p. 43).
Internal Consistency Analyses.Table 4 indicates the mean
score per item (with standard deviation) in each of the new
scales, and the internal consistency values for each scale. It
can be seen that the values for coefficient  are uniformly
high, ranging from .84 to .89.
Analyses Using IRT Methodology.Table 5 provides parameter
values from MULTILOG and PARSCALE for the most
informative items from the scales representing each process
and each theme. The values for slope are all very high, indi-
cating that these items are extremely informative.
Discussion
Completing the 55 items of the GABS by rating each of them
on a 5-point Likert-type scale is demanding of respondents'
time and effort, and this concern may be particularly perti-
nent in a clinical setting. Distilling the instrument into its
most informative items, as indicated above, could save
examinees' time without loss of essential information. But
there are other compelling reasons for examining the GABS
scales item by item. A concern arising from classical test
theory methods is that items within a scale are treated as if

they were interchangeable. For example, scoring the GABS
Self-Downing subscale in the traditional way involves aggre-
gating a respondent's scores from each of the 9 items as if
each has equal weighting, typically an untested assumption
in respect of both the item itself and the Likert-type scale of
measurement (Bond & Fox, 2007). There is only one way of
attaining the lowest possible score on the subscale (endors-
ing "strongly disagree," or 1, for each item), and only one
way of obtaining the highest score (recording "strongly
agree," or 5, for each item). But total scores intermediate
between 9 and 45 can be arrived at in many different ways.
The number of possible response patterns on a 9-item sub-
scale, each item rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale, is 59, or
1,953,125.
In fact, the GABS subscales all show high internal consis-
tency, indicating that respondents are unlikely to produce a
very wide range of the possible response patterns. Yet
respondents with the same Self-Downing score (for exam-
ple) could show many different patterns of specific item
endorsements, and thus could have varying perspectives on
self-criticism and self-abasement. Selecting and scaling the
most informative items with IRT methodology and present-
ing only such items to respondents can guarantee that similar
scores represent similar item endorsements.
The data from the six irrational subscales of the GABS in
our study were highly consistent with those from four other
student samples responding to the GABS in Australia and the
United Kingdom (Table 2). The overall concordance of the
rankings of the six mean subscale item scores across the five
studies was very high; all studies produced the same rank-
ings for Demands for Fairness, Need for Achievement, Need
for Approval, and Self-Downing. Thus, nonclinical samples
produce an impressive degree of consistency in displaying a
shared ordering of GABS irrational subscale scores.
The IRT analyses of the data from this study produced
results consistent with the rankings of subscale scores, but
placed the items on a more secure psychometric foundation
and a more dependable metric (Bond & Fox, 2007; Dumenci
& Achenbach, 2008). Each subscale showed satisfactory
unidimensionality, as determined by the exploratory factor
analyses--the results of which are consistent with the factor
structure of the GABS as identified by its originators and
developers. The PARSCALE GRM estimates for item loca-
tion are well grounded in that difficulty levels are drawn
from all five response options in each item. Polytomous
items provide "more information over a wider range of the
trait continuum than . . . dichotomous items" (Ostini &
Nering, 2006, p. 8).
The most informative items from each of the irrational
subscales of the GABS form a unidimensional six-item scale
suitable for further study with respondents in clinical set-
tings. Table 3 identifies Self-Downing (represented by Item

44) as the most irrational of the original subscales, and
Demands for Fairness (Item 46) as the least, in that Item 44
functions among respondents with the highest trait levels for
irrationality, and Item 46 among those with the lowest. Many
respondents will endorse an item from the Demands for
Fairness subscale, but only those with high levels of irratio-
nality agree with a Self-Downing item. Consistent with that,
Table 1 reveals that respondents show low mean subtest
scores for Self-Downing and high mean subtest scores for
Demands for Fairness. The location values for the processes
and themes indicate that the low frustration tolerance item is
lowest for irrationality among the processes, whereas the
global rating item is highest. Among the themes, achieve-
ment is lowest and comfort is highest for irrationality. This
signifies that respondents with relatively low trait levels for
irrationality may readily agree with items revealing low frus-
tration tolerance and concerns about achievement. Only
respondents with the highest trait levels for irrationality
endorse items reflecting global ratings of worth and extreme
preoccupations with comfort.
The MULTILOG and PARSCALE analyses were also
helpful in indicating items for which the five response
options on the Likert-type scale were all operating optimally.
For example, the ICCs for Item 48 in Figure 3 reveal that the
transitions between all five response options are clear and
informative; most respondents chose options 1, 2, or 3, and
only those with the highest trait levels for irrationality chose
options 4 or 5 to register "agree" or "strongly agree" with
this irrational item. Table 3 shows that some items produced
high values exceeding +3.00 for response option 5 (strongly
agree), especially Item 30. Future work on the GABS could
focus on the utility of the five-item Likert-type scale for all
items. For example, possibly options 4 and 5 in Item 30
could be collapsed into a single category for agreement with-
out loss of information.
Consistent with the results of other recent studies, Self-
Downing emerged as the most irrational of the six original
irrational beliefs scales measured by the GABS in our stu-
dent sample. Among the irrational appraisal mechanisms,
demandingness is viewed as primary while awfulizing, low
frustration tolerance, and self-downing are regarded as sec-
ondary; and demandingness and self-downing are seen as
schemata, whereas awfulizing and low frustration tolerance
are cast as propositional networks (David & Lynn, 2010).
Thus self-downing, linked with a pattern of evaluating
human worth in global terms, is given prominence both as an
irrational secondary appraisal mechanism and as a schema.
Demandingness has been associated with several clinical
conditions, including anger, depressed mood, and anxiety;
self-downing is correlated with depressed mood. Further
research on the irrational beliefs assessed by the GABS
could help identify with greater precision and clarity the
specific patterns associated with particular disorders com-
monly presented in outpatient mental health settings (David
& Lynn, 2010).
Limitations
Because REBT is applied in clinical settings, our use of a
student sample in this research may be questioned as limiting
the generality of our findings to clients and patients. Further
research with clinical populations is indicated before we can
recommend an abbreviated form of the GABS for profes-
sional use.
In general terms, there is no impediment to using data
from respondents with low trait levels for irrationality to
inform test development and refinement because of the
predicted group invariance in the item parameter esti-
mates produced by modern test theory methodology
(Baker, 2001). In IRT, estimates of item characteristics
hold true regardless of the "abilities" of the group being
tested; a group of respondents with low trait levels will
produce the same ICCs as a group with high trait levels. In
other words, "the item parameters are not dependent upon
the ability level of the examinees responding to the item"
(Baker, 2001, p. 51). If nonclinical and clinical respon-
dents differ only in the degree to which they endorse irra-
tional beliefs, then generalization from students to patients
can be justified. However, that assumption will have to be
tested empirically in prospective research with clinical
samples.
One hypothesis for future research is that clients or
patients may be less preoccupied than the student respon-
dents were with irrational beliefs about the importance of
being treated fairly by others (e.g., demanding that others
must treat one fairly) and personal achievement (e.g., see-
ing achievement as a dire necessity rather than a strong
preference). The Demands for Fairness and Need for
Achievement subscales were the "easiest" in terms of irra-
tionality in our study; in other words, students who were
practically at the median for irrationality were still likely
enough to endorse irrational items from those subscales.
The Self-Downing items, by contrast, produced relatively
few endorsements from our sample but a prediction is that
people receiving mental health services may be far more
likely to agree with such items. The results of future
research on the GABS with clinical samples will no doubt
improve assessment practices and advance the further
development of REBT interventions.
