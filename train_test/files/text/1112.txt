Objective To examine the association between retrospectively reported attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) symptoms and progression to smoking and the association with nicotine
dependence. Methods Study sample consisted of a nationally representative cohort of U.S. adolescents
(n ¼ 13,494). Logistic regression was used to examine ADHD symptoms from both the inattentive (IN)
and hyperactive-impulsive (HI) domains and smoking trajectories. Linear regression was used to examine
nicotine dependence. Results HI symptoms were associated with progression from nonsmoking to regular
smoking (OR ¼ 1.14, 95% CI ¼ 1.07­1.21), and with progression from experimentation to regular
smoking (OR ¼ 1.16, 95% CI ¼ 1.08­1.26). IN and HI symptoms were associated with nicotine
dependence among current smokers (IN: b ¼ 0.17, SE ¼ 0.03, p < 0.0001; HI: b ¼ 0.10, SE ¼ 0.04.,
p < .001). Conclusions These results have important implications for the development of prevention and
treatment modalities.

Introduction
It is well established that there are numerous negative
health consequences due to smoking and that there is an
increased risk of smoking among those with a psychiatric
disorder (Breslau, Novak, & Kessler, 2004). Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the more
common psychiatric disorders in childhood and adult-
hood affecting between 2% and 5% of the population
(American Psychiatric Association, 1994). In addition to
having serious consequences for academic and other
outcomes, ADHD is a significant risk factor for smoking
among both adults (41­42% vs. 26% for ADHD and
nonADHD, respectively) and adolescents (19.0­46% vs.
10­24% for ADHD and nonADHD, respectively)
(Lambert & Hartsough, 1998; Milberger, Biederman,
Faraone, Chen, & Jones, 1997; Milberger, Biederman,
Faraone, Wilens, & Chu, 1997; Molina & Pelham, 2003;
Pomerleau, Downey, Stelson, & Pomerleau, 1995;
Rohde, Kahler, Lewinsohn, & Brown, 2004). Moreover,
individuals with ADHD report earlier initiation of
smoking and report more difficulty quitting than
individuals in the general population (Milberger et al.,
1997; Molina & Pelham, 2003; Pomerleau et al., 1995;
Rohde et al., 2004).
There is considerable evidence that core ADHD
symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity
confer risk for smoking related behaviors, independent
of clinical diagnosis. For example, in a recent study in
a large population-based sample of young adults, retro-
spectively-reported ADHD symptoms were significantly
and linearly related to lifetime smoking risk, age of
onset of regular smoking and, among current smokers,
number of daily cigarettes smoked (Kollins, Fuemmeler,
& McClernon, 2005). The findings of this epidemiologic
study are consistent with other reports in the literature
using community and nonclinical samples and with
laboratory studies of the effects of nicotine on attention
and other executive functions (Burke, Loeber, & Lahey,

2006; Tercyak, Lerman, & Audrain, 2002).
The separate domains of ADHD symptoms
[i.e., inattention and hyperactive-impulsive (HI)] may be
differentially related to smoking outcomes among
both clinical and nonclinical populations. For example,
the risk for smoking has been shown to be more strongly
associated with the number of reported inattentive (IN)
symptoms than by the diagnosis of ADHD itself in
a clinical sample (Burke et al., 2001). In contrast, a study
in a nonclinical population has reported that HI
symptoms are more strongly associated with lifetime
risk of smoking than IN symptoms (Kollins et al., 2005).
The differences in findings between these studies may
reflect differences in how relations between ADHD
symptoms interact with smoking at various points in
the life-course. For instance, Burke et al. employed an
adolescent sample, whereas the study by Kollins et al.
was a cross-sectional analysis of smoking in a young
adult sample. As such, different ADHD symptoms may
contribute to different aspects of smoking behavior, and
these effects may be influenced by developmental level.
One potential approach for understanding the differ-
ential contribution of HI and IN symptoms to the
development of smoking and related outcomes is to
examine the progression of smoking behavior prospectively.
Smoking behavior does not progress similarly for all
adolescents. For instance, some adolescents may experi-
ment with smoking but never become addicted, whereas
others may progress to regular smoking. Smoking experi-
mentation is typically initiated during this early adolescent
phase with those who begin at an earlier age more likely to
become addicted and more likely to have more difficult time
quitting (Chassin, Presson, Pitts, & Sherman, 2000;
Khuder, Dayal, & Mutgi, 1999). Although several studies
have begun to show an association between smoking
behaviors and ADHD symptoms, few studies have explored
the degree to which symptoms influence progression to
smoking. Establishing an association between psychiatric
symptoms and the progression to addictive behaviors is a
first step toward examining potential causal mechanisms
and planning optimal methods and time periods for
intervention. At least one study has examined the associa-
tion between psychiatric disorders and risk to progression
to daily smoking during the transition between adolescence
and young adulthood and found a lifetime diagnosis of
ADHD to be a significant predictor of progression, although
this study did not report the differential effects of IN and HI
symptoms, and did not report on data from a population-
base sample (Rohde et al., 2004).
The purpose of the present study was twofold. First,
we assessed the differential effects of retrospectively
reported HI and IN symptoms on the progression of
smoking behaviors from adolescence through young
adulthood. Second, we examined the relation between
HI and IN symptoms on reports of nicotine dependence
in individuals who were current regular smokers. Based
on our previous work and the work of others suggesting
hyperactive symptoms to be important predictors of
lifetime smoking risk, we hypothesized that although both
HI and IN symptoms would be associated with progres-
sion to smoking, HI symptoms would confer a greater
risk. We examined data from the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health)--a nationally
representative cohort of youth--to accomplish these goals
(Bearman, Jones, & Udry, 1997; Resnick et al., 1997).
Methods
Data Source
The study population was drawn from 20,747 adoles-
cents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health, a nationally representative study of adolescents.
The longitudinal cohort includes 14,388 eligible respon-
dents who participated in in-home surveys on three
separate occasions (April­December, 1995, April­August,
1996, and August, 2001­August, 2002). The mean age of
survey participants on the three waves of data collection
was 15.65 (SD ¼ 1.75) years, 16.22 (SD ¼ 1.64) years,
and 22.96 (SD ¼ 1.77) years. By design, the Add Health
survey included a sample stratified by region, urbanicity,
school type, ethnic mix and size to garner a nationally
representative sample. Precise details regarding the design
and data collection have been described elsewhere
(Bearman et al., 1997; Resnick et al., 1997).
Study Sample
For the present study, the subpopulation of individuals
with available population weights and who had reported
data on the smoking items that comprised the trajectory
categories included 13,494 participants. Women who
were pregnant (n ¼ 379) were excluded, as it was believed
that women who were pregnant may alter their smoking
behaviors. Further, participants who were regular smokers
at Wave I (n ¼ 2670) were excluded from analysis
because they would not provide unique information
about progression to smoking. Thus, the available study
sample included 10,445 participants who included the
following: nonsmokers at Wave I who continued to be
nonsmokers at Wave III (n ¼ 4810), nonsmokers at
Wave I who went on to be experimenters at Wave III
1204 Fuemmeler, Kollins, and McClernon
(n ¼ 1554), nonsmokers at Wave I who went on to be
regular smokers at Wave III (n ¼ 1669), experimenters
at Wave I who continued to be experimenters at Wave III
(n ¼ 993), and experimenters at Wave I who went on
to be regular smokers at Wave III (n ¼ 1419). See Fig. 1
for details.
Measures
Smoking Progression and Dependence. In our analyses,
smoking experimentation was defined as those subjects
who had smoked a whole cigarette at least once. Regular
smoking was defined as ever having smoked at least one
cigarette daily for 30 consecutive days. Based on these
definitions, three separate dichotomous smoking trajec-
tories were used to describe progression of nicotine use
across Waves I and III. First, an Experimentation (EXP)
trajectory was defined in which adolescents who reported
no experimentation with smoking at either Waves I or III
were classified as 0; those who reported no experimenta-
tion at Wave I, but experimentation at Wave III (but not
regular use) were classified as 1. A second trajectory,
Regular Smoking Initiation (RegSmk) was defined as
follows: those subjects who reported no experimentation
at either Waves I or III were classified as 0; those who
reported no experimentation at Wave I, but regular
smoking at Wave III were classified as 1. Finally, a third
trajectory of Progression to Regular Smoking (ProgSmk)
was defined. In this trajectory, subjects who reported
experimentation at Wave I and regular smoking at
Wave III were classified as 1, while all others were
classified as 0. These three trajectories, therefore,
captured different patterns of smoking progression from
adolescence to young adulthood.
Participants who reported current regular smoking at
Wave III also completed the six items that comprise
the Fagerstro
¨m Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND),
a widely used measure of nicotine use (Heatherton,
Kozlowski, Frecker, & Fagerstrom, 1991). Sample items
of the FTND include, ``do you smoke more frequently
during the first hours after waking than during the rest of
the day'' and ``do you still smoke even if you are so ill
that you are in bed most of the day.'' The Fagerstrom

questionnaire is used widely to characterize levels of
nicotine dependence and use. Scores from this instru-
ment have been found to be correlated with biomarkers
for nicotine levels (C. S. Pomerleau, Carton, Lutzke,
Flessland, & Pomerleau, 1994; Radzius, Moolchan,
Henningfield, Heishman, & Gallo, 2001). Summed
scores from these six items were used as the primary
measure of nicotine dependence for analysis.
ADHD
In Wave III, participants were asked to retrospectively
report ADHD symptoms experienced between the ages of
5 and 12 years. Respondents were asked to report the
frequency of a symptom using a 4-point Likert scale:
never or rarely, sometimes, often, very often. For reasons
that are not clear, one item asked in the retrospective
ADHD section of Wave III--``you were spiteful or
vindictive''--is not a DSM-IV ADHD symptom and was
excluded from analyses; while one DSM-IV impulsivity
symptom, ``often interrupts or intrudes on others'' was
not included in the retrospective ADHD section. Thus,
our analyses included responses to nine IN and eight HI
symptoms. Table I displays symptoms of ADHD assessed
in Add Health.
A symptom was considered present if it was
experienced ``often'' or ``very often.'' This approach
to dichotomizing symptoms has been used in other
community-based studies of ADHD symptomatology, is
considered clinical convention (Murphy & Barkley, 1996)
and was also used in a previous study on the relation
between ADHD and smoking outcomes (Kollins et al.,
2005). For our primary analyses, the total number of
symptoms reported (0­9 for IN; 0­8 for HI) was used as
a measure of ADHD severity in order to assess the
relation between symptoms and smoking progression and
dependence. Individuals were also classified into one
of four clinically relevant groups based on the number
of reported symptoms: (a) IN subtype: 6 IN symptoms,
<6 HI symptoms (2.69%); (b) HI subtype: 6 HI
symptoms, <6 IN symptoms (2.93%); (c) Combined
subtype: 6 IN symptoms AND 6 HI symptoms
(2.52%); and (d) Control subtype: <6 HI AND <6 IN
symptoms (91.86%). The six-symptom cutoff was chosen
to be consistent with DSM-IV ADHD criteria requiring
the presence of six or more symptoms from either the IN
or HI symptom domains. As such, it does not represent
a proxy for the diagnosis of ADHD.
The use of retrospective report is common in clinical
practice when working with adults with ADHD and data
exist that support the reliability and validity of these self-
reports (Epstein & Kollins, 2005; P. Murphy & Schachar,
2000; Stein et al., 1995; Ward, Wender, & Reimherr,
1993; Zucker, Morris, Ingram, Morris, & Bakeman,
2002). In our previous report, we also demonstrated
adequate reliability and validity of this approach by
demonstrating good internal consistency of the items
(a ¼ .86) as well as showing that parents of respondents
reporting six or more symptoms on either or both HI and
IN scales were more likely to indicate learning or
behavioral problems at Wave 1; and these individuals
also were more likely to report taking medications for
ADHD at Wave III (Kollins et al., 2005).
Demographic and Other Variables
Demographic factors that have been shown to contribute
to smoking risk were also assessed. These included items
assessing gender, race (white vs. nonwhite), and indica-
tors of socioeconomic status (parental report of the
highest education level of either themselves or their
spouse and whether the family of the participants had
received public assistance at Wave I).
Since conduct disorder (CD) has been shown in
previous studies to be an important mediator of the risk

between ADHD and substance use (Barkley, Fischer,
Edelbrock, & Smallish, 1990), we also included
a measure of CD symptoms in multivariate analyses.
This variable consisted of responses to 13 questions that
corresponded to DSM-IV symptom criteria for CD that
have been used in previous studies with the Add Health
database to characterize CD (Miles, van den Bree, &
Pickens, 2002). This CD variable derived from the Add
Health data set has also been shown to have adequate
internal consistency (a ¼ 0.67) (Kollins et al., 2005).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS-callable
SUDAAN (version 8.0) statistical software (SUDAAN
user's manual, release 8.0., 2001). SUDAAN allows for
control of survey design effects of individuals clustered in
sampling unit of school and stratification of geographic
region. Poststratification weights were applied in order to
allow the results to be comparable to young adults in the
U.S. population. Logistic regression analyses were used to
predict smoking trajectories from self-reported ADHD
symptoms. Two models were tested for each trajectory.
In the first, the total number of IN and HI symptoms
were used as predictors and in the second, the subtype
classification of ADHD symptoms was used (i.e., IN, HI,
Combined, and Control). In all models, age, sex,
ethnicity, SES variables, and CD were included to control
for their effects.
The relation between ADHD symptom domains and
self-reported nicotine dependence (as measured by
the FTND) among those who progressed to regular
smoking and who were currently smoking at Wave III
was analyzed using a multiple linear regression model
controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, SES, and CD. A second
regression analysis examined the subtype classification of
ADHD as a predictor of nicotine dependence.
Results
Figure 1 illustrates the composition of the different
smoking trajectories used for our analyses. Demographic
characteristics and CD symptoms for these trajectory
classes are presented in Table II.

(Table III). IN symptoms did not predict any of the
progression trajectories. In contrast, HI symptoms were
significantly associated with progression from no smoking
to regular smoking (OR ¼ 1.14; 95% CI: 1.07­1.21) and
from experimentation to regular smoking (OR ¼ 1.16;
95% CI: 1.08­1.26).
Results from analyses examining ADHD subtype as
a predictor of smoking trajectories are presented in
Table III. Similar to findings obtained using ADHD
symptoms as a continuous indicator, the IN subtype was
not significantly associated with any of the progression
trajectories. The HI subtype was associated with progres-
sion from no smoking to regular smoking initiation
(OR ¼ 1.90; 95% CI: 1.10­3.27) and with progression
from experimentation to regular smoking (OR ¼ 3.25;
95% CI: 1.54­6.86). The Combined subtype was
associated with progression from no smoking to regular
smoking initiation (OR ¼ 2.64; 95% CI: 1.48­4.72).
Impact of ADHD Symptoms on Nicotine
Dependence Among Current Smokers
For individuals reporting smoking in the past 30 days at
Wave III, both IN and HI symptoms were significantly
associated with nicotine dependence, after controlling for
CD, demographic factors, and the other symptom domain
(IN: b ¼ 0.17, SE ¼ 0.03, p < .0001; HI: b ¼ 0.10,
SE ¼ 0.04., p < .001). The model accounted for 9% of
the variance in the FTND measure. When subtype of
ADHD was examined as a predictor of nicotine
dependence, all three subtypes were significantly asso-
ciated with FTND scores (IN: b ¼ 0.74, SE ¼ 0.37,
p < .05; HI: b ¼ 1.26, SE ¼ 0.28, p < .0001; Combined:
b ¼ 1.24, SE ¼ 0.31, p < .0001). To explore the possibil-
ity that ADHD symptoms might be better predictors of
nicotine dependence among people without high levels of
either IN or HI symptoms, we conducted an exploratory

regression analysis restricting the sample to those people
reporting  6 IN and HI symptoms. Results suggest that
in this model IN symptoms were significant predictors of
nicotine dependence (b ¼ 0.24, SE ¼ 0.06, p < .0001),
while HI symptoms were not (b ¼ 0.08, SE ¼ 0.05,
p ¼ .08).
Discussion
Results from this study suggest that retrospectively
reported ADHD symptoms are significantly associated
with progression of smoking behavior and levels of
nicotine dependence in a large, population-based sample
of young adults. These findings extend previous work by
our group which found that ADHD symptoms, most
notably HI symptoms, increased lifetime risk of regular
smoking (Kollins et al., 2005). In the present study,
HI symptoms were significantly associated with the
progression from nonsmoking to regular smoking, and
with the progression from experimentation to regular
smoking. These results were significant even after
controlling for a range of other variables associated with
smoking risk, as well as controlling for IN symptoms.
We also found that among current smokers, the
number of self-reported IN symptoms was significantly
associated with the level of nicotine dependence as
measured by items from the FTND. However, when the
clinically relevant subtypes of symptoms were examined,
all three symptom clusters (IN, HI, and Comb) were
significantly associated with nicotine dependence.
Consistent with other complementary studies,
we also found in our models that white adolescents
were significantly more likely to progress to experimenta-
tion from nonsmoking and regular smoking from
nonsmoking than members of other racial/ethnic groups
(Flint, Yamada, & Novotny, 1998; Robinson, Berlin, &
Moolchan, 2004). We did not find that Whites were
significantly more likely to be in the trajectory group from
experimentation to regular smoking. It may be that racial
differences are mitigated among those who are initially
more experienced with tobacco use during adolescence,
although this deserves further study. This finding may
also reflect differences across racial categories with respect
to onset of regular smoking. For example, one study
found that African-American youth exhibited a 1-year
delay in onset of both initiation and daily smoking,
compared to nonAfrican-American youth (Robinson et al.,
2004). We also found that CD symptoms were
significantly associated with smoking progression in all
three trajectory groups. This is consistent with the
documented literature suggesting that CD symptoms
enhance risk of many types of substance use, including
tobacco (Lynskey & Fergusson, 1995). The findings
extend the literature as few studies have examined the
role of CD on smoking progression in longitudinal
cohorts (Mayhew, Flay, & Mott, 2000).
One of the unique aspects of the current study was
that we examined the role that ADHD has on various
patterns of smoking progression. In this study, ADHD
symptoms expressed both continuously and as clinically
relevant subtypes were associated with smoking progres-
sion, but not with progression to experimentation.
Although future studies are needed in this area, the
findings suggest that HI symptoms play a key role in the
adoption of regular smoking, but HI and IN symptoms
do not seem to play a role in the progression to
experimentation. In our previous study, we found that
ADHD symptoms were associated with earlier age of
onset of smoking (Kollins et al., 2005). To the extent that
ADHD symptoms were associated with earlier onset, it is
possible that ADHD symptoms are associated with earlier
experimentation. Notably, in order to study progression,
we excluded some individuals from our analyses because
they had already had a history of regular smoking prior to
the baseline data collection. Future prospective studies
will be needed that can assess ADHD symptoms and
smoking behaviors from an earlier age in order to more
definitely determine and describe this ADHD symptom--
smoking relation from early childhood, to adolescence,
to young adulthood. Overall, the findings are important
as they extend previous work by demonstrating not only
that ADHD symptoms are associated with lifetime risk
of smoking (Kollins et al., 2005), but also that they
influence the developmental progression of smoking
behavior.
Another unique aspect of the study was that we
examined what effect retrospectively reported ADHD
symptoms had on nicotine dependence in current
smokers. When we assessed ADHD symptoms as a
continuous factor, IN and HI symptoms were related to
FTND scores and, when the ADHD subtype variable
was used in the regression analyses, all three subtypes
predicted FTND scores. We also found that when
considering symptom presentation that is below tradi-
tional clinical levels (i.e., less than six symptoms), only
IN symptoms regulate nicotine dependence. These
findings are consistent with the literature documenting
the beneficial effects of nicotine on attention (Levin et al.,
2006; Levin & Rezvani, 2002; Rezvani & Levin, 2001) as
they suggest individuals with inattention symptoms may
ADHD Symptoms and Smoking Progression 1209
be administering nicotine to improve attention. These
preliminary findings suggest more research is needed on
the role that IN and HI have on regulating dependence in
both clinical and nonclinical ADHD samples.
There are several limitations to the present study that
warrant comment. First, the primary independent variable
was based on retrospective self-report of ADHD symp-
toms in childhood. The nature of the Add Health survey
was such that individuals were asked to report on
symptoms occurring 10 years before the time of report.
As such, the extent to which this self-report reliably
and validly reflects ADHD symptoms in childhood is
unknown. Complicating this issue is the degree to which
individuals with true ADHD symptoms may be able to
accurately report on the presence or absence of such
symptoms. However, as mentioned, the use of retro-
spective report is very common in clinical practice when
working with adults with ADHD, and these approaches
have been found to be reliable and valid (Epstein &
Kollins, 2005; Murphy & Schachar, 2000; Stein et al.,
1995; Ward et al., 1993; Zucker et al., 2002). Further-
more, the Add Health survey of HI symptoms lacked one
item included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders nomenclature (i.e., interrupts or
intrudes on others) (American Psychiatric Association,
1994). If this is a low prevalent symptom, in the
population, there may be negligible effects; however,
if it is a highly prevalent symptom, the data may
underestimating HI symptoms. It is difficult to know
for certain what effect these survey limitations may have
on our findings. However, as we have noted previously,
the approach to quantifying ADHD symptoms within the
Add Health does appear demonstrate consistency among
the items and promising evidence of measurement
validity (i.e., parents of respondents reporting six or
more symptoms on either or both HI and IN scales were
more likely to indicate that their participating child had
a learning or behavioral problem when they were
children and respondents also were more likely to
report taking medications for ADHD symptoms at
Wave III) (Kollins et al., 2005).
A second limitation was the use of the FTND as the
primary measure of nicotine dependence. The FTND
has been criticized as more a measure of ``use'' than
a measure of ``dependence'' (Colby, Tiffany, Shiffman,
& Niaura, 2000). Assessment of craving or the use of
biological verification may have been a more precise way
of characterizing nicotine use and dependence, but these
endpoints were unavailable in the context of the available
data set.
A third limitation is that the Add Health study is not
a clinical sample. Thus, although we categorized indivi-
duals based on subtypes of ADHD symptom (predomi-
nately inattention, predominately hyperactive, and
combined) this cannot be considered a true diagnostic
estimate of prevalence in the population. Rather, this
method was primarily chosen to explore how
the potentially relevant ``clinical categories'' relate to
smoking progression. A further limitation of using a
nonclinical sample is that alternative comorbid diagnoses
could not be evaluated. Therefore, the impact of clinically
relevant symptoms and categories as well as other
potential related diagnoses (e.g., Pervasive Developmental
Disorders, Anxiety Disorders) could not be fully exam-
ined in the current models. The effect of these conditions
will need to be evaluated with clinic-based rather than
population-based samples. Nevertheless, the approach
taken in this study provides evidence of a potential
relation between ADHD symptoms (along with subtypes)
and smoking progression at a population-level and thus,
adds to and extends research in clinical samples. Finally,
a myriad of factors have been associated with smoking
initiation and progression including, family, peer, envi-
ronmental, and policy. While a full treatment of these
factors is outside the scope of the current study, this area
is ripe for future investigation.
In spite of its limitations, the present study has a
number of strengths. This is the first study to system-
atically examine the link between ADHD symptoms
and progression of smoking behaviors in a nationally
representative longitudinal cohort. As such, these findings
add to the literature that has previously identified risk
conferred by ADHD symptoms to smoking outcomes,
in general (Kollins et al., 2005; Tercyak et al., 2002).
Also, these findings highlight the potential unique
contributions of the IN and HI symptom domains in
the development of smoking-related behaviors. Under-
standing such differences will be important to extend this
work and to consider how the present data may be used
to develop viable prevention or intervention strategies.
The present results suggest that the observed effects
have important public health implications. The specific
results indicate that a one unit increase in hyperactive
symptoms was associated with a 14% increased odds
of progressing from no smoking in adolescence to initiat-
ing regular smoking and a 16% increased odds of
progressing from experimentation to regular smoking.
Moreover, having six or more symptoms of both types of
ADHD symptoms was associated with a two and a half
fold increased odds of progressing from no smoking
1210 Fuemmeler, Kollins, and McClernon
to initiating regular smoking and a nearly two fold
increased odds of progressing from experimenting to
regular smoking. If these associations represent a true
relationship, they could have an important implication at
a population level, as ADHD symptoms are common
among children. Continued research that can verify these
associations would be needed to accurately estimate
the population effect. Nevertheless, an implication of the
present study is that measuring these symptoms in the
general population may prove useful in identifying
individuals at higher risk for smoking, regardless of
whether they are also at risk for ADHD diagnosis. Such
individuals might then be selectively targeted for early
prevention/intervention efforts. Likewise, our findings
could inform treatment and prevention efforts and
suggest that the effects of such efforts may be moderated
by the presence of ADHD symptoms. That is, traditional
prevention and intervention programs may be less
effective among individuals with high levels of ADHD
symptomatology.
These results highlight the need for additional work
in this area. Notably, the study results are correlational.
Ideally, research that uses prospective longitudinal
designs to more fully characterize the relationship
between ADHD symptoms in youth with smoking
outcomes later in life will address some of the limitations
of the current study. Given the convergence in the
literature with respect to the link between ADHD
symptoms and nicotine use, as well as laboratory studies
of nicotine effects on attention and related process, basic
laboratory studies that investigate the potential mecha-
nisms underlying these associations are warranted.
