Introduction
In Australia, the promulgation of policies, and the allocation
of funds associated with those policies, has seen a discourse
of performativity that privileges measurable outcome goals,
redefining earlier notions of teacher professionalism. Some
teachers have embraced the performance agenda, seeing it as
an opportunity to advance successful careers and increase
professional development opportunities (Goodrham &
Hodkinson, 2004; D. H. Hargreaves, 1994; Stronach, Corbin,
McNamara, Stark, & Warne, 2002). Others see loss of
morale, identity, and autonomy, an overemphasis on account-
ability and a tightly surveilled, low trust working environ-
ment that stifles innovation and creativity (Avis, 2005;
Blackmore, 2004; Burnard & White, 2008; Kelchtermans,
2004; O'Connor & White, 2011; Sanguinetti, 2000). Many
writers such as Deem, Hilliard, and Reed (2008) posit that
autonomy is an integral part of professionalism (Furlong,
Barton, Miles, Whiting, & Whitty, 2000; Leaton Gray &
Whitty, 2010; Quicke, 2000), and with the relentless creep-
ing of performative practices into education, it is timely to
investigate how teachers are performing their roles by
accepting, reacting to, or challenging such a performative
discourse. We argue that there is a need to dig deeper into
different landscapes to explore how teachers are responding
to this redefinition of professionalism as performativity. We
borrow from Foucault's (1972) archaeological toolbox to
enable us to undertake this excavation.
This article first conceptualizes performativity in educa-
tional contexts and then outlines how a performative dis-
course and its associated practices have colonized the
Australian educational landscape with particular escalation
since the turn of the century. In this study, teachers' experi-
ences of these changes are captured through open-ended
interviewing techniques before their "statements" are sub-
jected to Foucauldian archaeological analysis to identify
their reactions to the prevailing performative climate. These
findings are discussed in relation to the educational field,
revealing how teachers are playing what Foucault (1972) has
described as their "truth game" of professionalism and per-
formativity. While some comply, many voices reveal teach-
ers who choose to "jump past the hoops" rather than "through
the hoops" in resisting the identified performativity agenda.
Performativity in Education
Resting on the fundamental economic assumptions that insti-
tutional competition and consumer preferences are an effi-
cient resource allocation system, the performance agenda has
emerged as a counterpoint to older policy technologies of
professionalism (Ball, 2003; Blackmore, 2004). In essence,
performativity privileges measurable outcome goals. Such
performance indicators encapsulate or represent the worth,
quality, or value of an individual or organization within a

Teachers Performing Professionalism: A
Foucauldian Archaeology
Terri Bourke1, John Lidstone1, and Mary Ryan1
Abstract
Faced with the perceived need to redefine education for more economic utilitarian purposes, as well as to encourage
compliance with government policies, Australia, like many other Anglophone nations, has engaged in numerous policy shifts
resulting in performativity practices becoming commonplace in the educational landscape. A series of interviews with teachers
from Queensland, Australia, in which they revealed their experiences of professionalism are examined archaeologically
to reveal how they enact their roles in response to this performative agenda. Findings suggest that while there is some
acceptance among teachers of the performative discourse, there is increasing resistance, which permits the construction of
alternative or counter-discourses to the currently internationally pervasive performative climate.

field of judgment (Ball, 2003; Burnard & White, 2008).
Performance criteria are often justified as a necessary means
of ensuring accountability and equity in the distribution of
scarce educational resources with some limits placed on pro-
fessional autonomy accepted as minor collateral damage
(Groundwater & Sachs, 2002; A. Hargreaves, 2003).
However, Chua (2009, p. 160) claims that the result is a
restriction of teachers' "designerly cognition" and "designer
identities," lowering the professional standards of educators
as they limit their aim to the visible and measurable goals
captured by the performance criteria. Similarly, Avis (2005)
claims that other conceptualizations of good practice outside
performance criteria are silenced and denied legitimacy.
A recent study by Vidovich and Currie (2011) found that
Australia is an extreme example of external regulation that
privileges corporate over academic modes, is characterized
by coercion, and staff and students' voices are no longer
heard as the trust gap widens and a performative agenda
takes hold. From this perspective, where once teachers were
positioned as having specialized knowledges (Shulman,
1987), a shared technical culture, and a strong service ethic
(Carr, 2000; Etzioni, 1969; Goodson & Hargreaves, 1996;
Larson, 1977), many writers agree that teachers are increas-
ingly discursively repositioned as non-experts. With educa-
tional decisions coming from outside the educational world,
teachers all but work in standardized accountable environ-
ments as unquestioning supporters and implementers of a
competency-based, outcome-oriented pedagogy related to
the world of work, in line with Australian government poli-
cies (Sachs, 2003). For some, such conflict is highly person-
alized, what Ball (2003) has referred to as struggles over
teachers' souls. For such teachers, the ethics of competition
and performance differ markedly from previous ethics of
professional judgment and cooperation (Burnard & White,
2008). To explore this contested space, we operationalize
Foucauldian archaeology as our method of investigation.
Archaeology is a comparative analysis designed to examine
the simultaneous exchanges between discourses influencing
the current policy and teacher context. We therefore begin
with a historical representation of the Australian educational
context and then specifically refer to Queensland where the
interviews took place.
The Australian Historical Educational
Context
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, teachers in Australia were
subjected to various discourses of derision in government
documents and the popular media, being blamed for wide-
spread unemployment and used as scapegoats for the failure
of governments' educational policies. Cultural conservatives
and the then Liberal Government, followed by the subse-
quent Labor Government, business leaders, and the New
Right, as well as the "trial by media" (Sugrue, 2009, p. 373),
reiterated the myth of decline in standards and generated a
sense of crisis in education that they intimated would lead to
national decline. This relentless onslaught resulted in
employer organizations being rewarded with a policy role in
education (Marginson, 1997). What employers wanted was a
competency-based pedagogy directly related to the world of
work (Robertson, 1996). The result was that thinking skills,
problem-solving, coping with authority, and social skills
(vocationalism) rose high on the priority list. Governments at
the time also thought it necessary that schools form school/
business partnerships (Robertson, 1996). Various interna-
tional policy documents such as Investing in Our Children:
Business and the Public Schools from the U.S. Committee
for Economic Development (CED) urged business to take
the challenge of improving schools by using the principles of
effective organization and management (CED, 1985).
Tertiary institutions were also invited to forge business links
through collaborative programs.
This phase in Australia became known as the "Reorg"
(Ashenden, 1990). Education was presented with a new eco-
nomic mission (Blackmore & Sachs, 2005), not just about
developing the skills and talents of theAustralian nation as in
years gone by but now about developing education and
research as a way to increase the nation's global competitive-
ness. Essential to this objective was the restructuring of
teachers' work and reconstitution of their professionalism
within an economic and performative framework.
Thus, teachers were simultaneously blamed for all the ills
in society and presented as the mechanism for national eco-
nomic reconstruction. Organisation for Economic
Co-Operation and Development (OECD) reports at the time
called for globalization and a program of microeconomic
reform, and this became the taken-for-granted international
wisdom the Australian government took on board. Under the
leadership of Dawkins, Minister of Employment, Education,
and Training from 1987 to 1991, the government used many
strategies to follow the OECD line. Education was further
opened up to the business sector to ensure a productive
workforce, a competency-based curriculum was introduced
to schools to meet industry requirements, and the Australian
Research Council (ARC) was formed to make Australia
more productive (Marginson, 1997). With business drawn
into education, more corporate forms of management were
introduced into educational establishments. Strategies such
as the creation of market-based systems of accountability,
the formation of national systems (corporate federalism,
Lingard, 1991), devolution, and industrial mechanisms led to
new forms of educational management that inevitably weak-
ened the position of teachers. Education became redefined as
an industry with inputs and outputs, operating as a national/
global market in which choice and competition would
enhance the quality of teaching, as parents (the education
consumers) shopped around.
This marketization of education (Sachs, 2003) saw
schools marketing themselves with mission statements and
strategic plans expressed in "business-speak." These market
Bourke et al. 3
strategies became the commonsense discourses of schooling.
Rather than being seen as problematic, they became the con-
temporary taken-for-granted way of thinking at that time,
and schools that did not take on this approach were said to be
"out of touch." According to Sachs (2003, p. 18), the impera-
tives of this market regime were for schools to produce stu-
dents who were "numerate, literate and able to take civic and
social responsibility" as multi-skilled, flexible workers who
would boost the economy and increase international
competitiveness.
In pursuit of this goal, schools were transformed into car-
riers of economic policy; corporations with line managers
working effectively and efficiently under direct ministerial
control. Teachers were repositioned as education workers
subject to this management. However, in what Sachs (2003)
referred to as a paradoxical strategy, devolved school man-
agement (Blackmore, 2004) was introduced to give the illu-
sion of a quest for quality that was controlled locally, but the
development of policies and strategic control of teaching,
curriculum, and assessment remained firmly in the hands of
centrally located bureaucrats. This distancing by govern-
ments, or "steering at a distance," was a successful strategy
for avoiding controversy while positioning teachers as the
weak link in the educational supply chain.
As "education workers," teachers became subject to
"industry" award restructuring strategies whereby, to win
pay increases, employers and unions had to "cooperate to
review their rewards in order to improve industry efficiency,
productivity and workers' career opportunities" (Reid, 1993,
p. 131). Offsetting work reorganization and productivity for
wage increases meant that industrial and educational issues
could no longer be separated and the government had a fur-
ther potent mechanism for reforming teachers' work.
These strategies redefined teachers as technicians whose
role it was to efficiently implement decisions made by their
managers (Blackmore & Sachs, 2005). Their job was to
improve student performance, compete with neighboring
schools for resources, and raise money from the business
sector (Robertson, 1996). However, they were not to be
involved in intellectual, philosophical, or epistemological
decisions (Reid, 1993). Governments were strategic, making
sure that any consultation processes with teachers were
tightly managed. The intellectual autonomy characterized in
traditional discourses of professionalism had well and truly
been stripped from teachers.
"Discourses of derision" continued into the 1990s, but
this time not only were teachers being attacked but also a
discussion paper by the Department of Employment,
Education and Training in 1992 openly asserted that teacher
educators in Australia had lost touch with classrooms as well
as being too old and set in their ways (Department of
Employment, Education and Training [DEET], 1992).
Governments maintained that what was needed in pre-ser-
vice teacher courses was a focus on classroom skills (Reid,
1993) instead of philosophy, history, and sociology. This was
further strengthened by the push for the development of
national competency standards.
Since the turn of the century, performativity activities in
Australian education include, but are not limited to, the use
of professional standards to enhance teacher quality and pro-
fessionalism with the implementation of the National
Professional Standards for Teachers1 developed by the
Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership
(AITSL); curriculum reform with the introduction of an
Australian National Curriculum; and the continuation of
high-stakes testing programs such as the NationalAssessment
Program­Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN2). The latter
two are both under the auspices of the Australian Curriculum
Reporting and Assessment Authority (ACARA).
Even though the performative agenda has colonized the
Australian educational landscape extensively, in what Lingard
(2010) has referred to as "new national accountabilities"
(p.129) or "cooperative federalism" (p. 130), Queensland,
where this study took place, has "a tradition of respecting
and trusting teacher judgement" (Klenowski, 2011, p. 81).
After the abolition of public examinations following the
Radford Report of 1969 (Lingard, 2010), the state has con-
tinued a 40-year history of school-based curriculum and
externally moderated standards-based assessment in the
senior phase of schooling (Years 11 and 12) with a Core
Skills Test having the effect of stretching teaching (Lingard,
2010). Such practices were extended with the New Basics
trials and, from 2005 to 2009, with the incorporation of stan-
dards referenced moderation in Years 1 to 9 (known as the
Queensland Curriculum,Assessment and Reporting [QCAR]
Framework). Queensland conceptualized the framework
from the view that assessment was an integral part of teach-
ing and learning. The tests were not about measuring school
or teacher effectiveness; rather, the intention was to build
teachers' assessment capacity and assessment literacy.
Teachers, valued as a community of learners met to discuss,
critique, and analyze student responses (Klenowski, 2011;
Klenowski & Wyatt-Smith, 2010, Lingard, 2010).
However, more recently, this trust seems to be disappear-
ing with pre-service teacher testing in literacy, numeracy,
and science an important agenda item in response to the
Australian (National) Curriculum. In addition, Education
Queensland has developed an initiative called Curriculum
into the Classroom (c2c), which outlines lesson-by-lesson
and unit-by-unit exactly what teachers should be teaching.
Although not yet mandatory for all state schools, it may
appear inevitable that some principals and teachers will
anticipate further encroachment of performativity practices
and thereby exacerbate an ever more regulated educational
environment.
While teachers have always been rendered "weak" since
the advent of compulsory mass schooling (Jones, 1990), the
21st century covert technologies include the increased modes
of surveillance epitomized by Bentham's Panopticon
(Foucault, 1995). Today's teachers, like Bentham's
4 SAGE Open
prisoners, perform as if surveillance is omnipresent.
Subjection to the assumed gaze results in teachers'self-mon-
itoring so that self-regulation occurs "naturally." Whether
this is through parental or community demands, registration
systems, the online audit of professional learning or the pub-
lication of high-stakes testing data, the monitoring system or
the "eyes that must see without being seen" (Foucault, 1995,
p. 171) produce information so that teachers are knowable
and may hence be regulated. This "visibility is a trap"
(Foucault, 1995, p. 200), locating teachers in a political field
invested with power relations that render them docile but
"productive." A hold is placed on their conduct as they are
coerced by means of observation. Teachers, in their quest to
achieve enhanced professional status through conforming to
current performance criteria, become regulated and con-
trolled by disciplinary technologies of the self (Blackmore,
2004; Osgood, 2006). In such an emerging environment, it is
timely to investigate how teachers are "performing" their
roles in this performative climate.
Methodology
As teachers and teacher educators, the authors have become
increasingly aware that many teachers struggle with per-
ceived inconsistencies between the stated requirements of
their employers and public discourse as a whole and their
personal beliefs about what it means to "be a teacher." To
conceptualize this awareness in a scholarly way, we looked
to the work of Michel Foucault who was interested in the
relationships between power and knowledge as a form of
social control, particularly in social institutions. Thus, in
response to the core question of this article--How do teach-
ers enact their roles in a constantly changing performative
climate?--a qualitative methodology using open-ended
interviews was chosen for data collection.
In previous work, the present authors have applied
Foucault's archaeological method to cross-analyze the aca-
demic literature on professionalism, policy documents, and
the statements made by currently practicing teachers. For the
purpose of this article, the focus is on the latter: the continu-
ities and discontinuities in the statements of teachers, voices
that according to Gale (1999), Dwyer (1995), Freeland
(1994), and Ball (1994) have often been neglected. Following
the principles of Foucault (1972), teachers' statements were
analyzed to develop a uniquely detailed archaeology.
Foucault delighted in others borrowing his tools and many
such as Scheurich (1994), Ball (1990, 1994), Gale (1999,
2007), and Taylor (1997) all to some extent have drawn on
his theories of discourse for policy analysis. Relatively few
have applied the tools to the empirical evidence of teacher
statements in the way we have.
Twenty Queensland teachers were invited to engage in
individual face-to-face recorded interviews of around 1-hr
duration with one of the current writers. Interviewees were
identified by a process of snow-balling from professional
learning networks to achieve maximum variation. The final
panel of respondents tabulated in the appendix reveals details
about gender, qualifications, school sector, position in the
hierarchy, and years of experience. Following the ethical
clearance guidelines from the university where the writers
are employed, informed consent was obtained from the inter-
viewees, and they were assigned a pseudonym for confiden-
tiality purposes. After initial closed questions to ascertain
participant demographics (see the appendix), the open-ended
approach to interviewing was outlined, assuring the partici-
pants that there were no right or wrong answers and encour-
aging them to elaborate on their practices and experiences as
part of a rich dialogue. This unstructured technique provided
insight into the interviewees' socially constructed worlds
(Freebody, 2003) and reduced the risk of the researcher lead-
ing the interview. Furthermore, interviewees were specifi-
cally asked to identify particular experiences as foci for the
discussion that followed. Given the frequent use of the word
"professional" in official and teacher discourses, the focal
question of the interview was "Please tell me about a time
when you felt you were being professional or behaving in a
particularly professional manner." The conversation contin-
ued with probing from the interviewer using the stem-plus-
query design (Cavana, Delahaye, & Sekaran, 2001), for
example, "I am interested in your concerns about unprofes-
sional behavior. Would you tell me about some of these con-
cerns?" Or, "you mentioned quite a few things . . . you
mentioned OP results . . . achievements . . . different abilities
in your classroom . . . so can you elaborate on your role as a
professional teacher . . . looking at those things." Therefore,
each interview took a different path as participants'responses
were explored.
In Foucauldian terms (1972), such teacher responses
(statements) are the "atoms" or "elementary units of a dis-
course" so when statements from the teachers in this study
make core repeatable claims, they emerge as the teachers'
regimes of truth on professionalism. Foucault's insistence
that statements must have a material existence meant that
each statement was recorded, placed, and dated against the
person who said it and their status (hierarchical level, years
of experience); in other words, who produced the statement
and with what authority (Ball, 1993). What follows is an
elaboration of our application of the archaeological method
to the interview data.
The first step in excavating the empirical data is looking
for homogeneity or continuity in the teachers' statements.
The repeatability is noted, counting the frequency of terms
and words with particular attention given to their arrange-
ment and co-location with other words and terms. A coding
mechanism is established that consists of numbering the
repeatable terms or words or overlapping themes (frequency
or analysis of terminology) running through the transcripts.
Statements from teachers are also analyzed to see whether
they present themselves as "passive" or "active" agents in
teacher work. This reveals their subject position.
Bourke et al. 5
The second step involves the identification of "distances"
between statements or, as Foucault (1972) prefers, the analy-
sis of contradictions. These discontinuities are equally as
important as the continuities and must be noted.
As noted above, archaeology yields a comparative analy-
sis and accordingly we chose to present our comparisons in
the light of a discussion of the Australian and the Queensland
historical educational context and the non-discursive domain
(see above). Finally, in what Foucault refers to as the analy-
sis of transformations, we reveal the interactions between
different elements of the system; for example, how different
interpretations of professionalism may vary in their implica-
tions for how teachers perform their roles.
Generative collaboration between the researchers work-
ing independently noted and numbered identified themes
before cross-referencing to look for comparability. This
whole process was conducted with a high degree of openness
to new interpretations; it was a strongly iterative and com-
parative process of sorting and resorting data (Akerlind,
2002).
The themes were continually reworked and refined until
the final set was determined. These themes represented the
"discourses" of professionalism as revealed by Queensland
teachers. For the purpose of this article, the discourses were
further scrutinized to examine how teachers enact their roles
in a performative climate.
Findings
The analysis of teachers' statements revealed that teachers
enact their roles in six main ways:
·
· Unresisting acceptance: Regarding performance-
related policies and practices as the uncontentious
definition of "professionalism" in teaching,
·
· Passive resistance: Choosing to ignore policy docu-
ments and other forms of external "pressure,"
·
· Subtle resistance: Enacting alternative truths,
·
· Overt resistance: Publically questioning the efficacy
of change agendas,
·
· Assertive resistance: Declaring professional confi-
dence and competence in the self as a reflective prac-
titioner, and
·
· Aspirational resistance: Promoting leadership rather
than performativity.
Each of these is addressed in detail below.
Unresisting Acceptance
Four of the participants in particular display unresisting
acceptance of policies and practices tied to performativity. In
the following example, Kory focuses on the professional
standards for Queensland teachers (Queensland College of
Teachers [QCT], 2006):
ThetenQCTStandardsweredevelopedbytheStateGovernment,
so they [teachers] can look at how well they are delivering
content . . . how you are continually progressing to become a
better educator . . . by taking a step back and looking at how you
meet each of the standards, you are able to tell, well I am not
doing this one really well, I can do this better.
Sally describes her use of the same document:
. . . the last standard is for reflective practice, especially when
developing major assessment units--it is really important . . . to
critically and effectively reflect on the work that you have done
to ensure that both the students and yourself are reflecting and
gaining from the learning experiences . . .
Kory and Sally are first-year teachers who use this policy
document "to reflect," "tak[e] a step back," and "critically
and effectively reflect." The repetition of statements such as
"continually progressing," "becom[ing] a better educator,"
and "gaining from the learning experiences" allude to how
these new teachers accept the policy documents unquestion-
ingly as a means of reflection for improving their perfor-
mance. They both concede that their knowledge of this
document was obtained while at university, simultaneously
illustrating the role of higher education institutions (HEIs) in
reinforcing the standards and performance discourse, and the
influence of the link between HEIs' funding and accredita-
tion of courses to standards implementation. Mary also
accepts the recently promulgated standards (Australian
Institute for Teaching and School Leadership [AITSL], 2011)
and reveals how she interprets her role within her school as
she supervises pre-service teachers. She says,
I meet with the beginning teacher, and go through the teacher
standards, and they need to show me . . . how they are reaching
those professional standards, or not reaching them--which ones
they think they are doing very well in, and not doing well in, and
what is it that I can do to help them develop in those areas.
Rather than encouraging the use of the standards for self-
reflection, Mary, a deputy principal with more than 20 years'
experience, uses this policy document to observe where new
teachers are "doing well" or where they need to "develop."
While the overlapping theme or continuity is about improv-
ing performance, terms such as "they need to show me . . . "
illustrate a subject position of power where Mary is active in
both promoting the reform agenda and establishing her own
superior position. This is in contrast (a discontinuity) with
Kory and Sally who passively accept the standards document
as a compliance discourse normalized and legitimized at uni-
versity (" . . . it is really important . . . " [Sally]; " . . . you are
able to tell" [Kory]).
Unresisting acceptance may also be exemplified in cases
where teachers have embraced the use of another policy
technology, that of high-stakes tests, not just for measuring
6 SAGE Open
student performance--"20% were under national bench-
mark" (Xanthe) and "we had two trial tests, one in February
. . . and that gave us the feedback we needed to see what they
[the students] didn't know" (Judy)--but also for determining
teacher performance, the latter notion shown in a statement
by Jan: "There needs to be some discussion about each
teacher and their performance." Jan has the responsibility for
NAPLAN testing in her school, and Xanthe and Judy are also
senior managers where part of their job is to risk manage
against poor public performance. Thus, it appears that all
these teachers (unresistingly) accept the performativity
agenda as they are required to impose such policies within
their hierarchical responsibilities. However, the majority of
responses from other teachers in this study reveal varying
degrees of resistance both to policies and practices.
Passive Resistance
Passive resistance is evident in the teachers' declared lack of
knowledge about performance related policy documents. An
example of this can be found in the participants'responses to
knowledge about the Professional Standards for Queensland
Teachers (QCT, 2006) document, introduced by the QCT
with the ostensible purpose of improving teacher quality and
enhancing professionalism in Queensland. As one respon-
dent clearly articulates--"never heard of them" (Mike).
Other participants show some knowledge of the standards
revealed in statements such as "I am aware there are docu-
ments. I did read some of it at some stage but I wouldn't be
able to articulate what the detail is" (Barbara), or "I flicked
through them . . . but would not know explicitly what those
standards were" (Tia). Such definitive common statements--
"I am aware" and "I did read"--reveal some degree of
"awareness" toward the Queensland standards. However,
terms such as [I] "wouldn't be able to articulate" and [I]
"would not know explicitly" indicate that both Tia and
Barbara have chosen either not to engage with or to disregard
the current order for professionalism in Queensland. Both of
these teachers are middle managers with between 11 and
19 years of experience in schools. However, their flippant
responses reveal that they perceive the standards to be, at the
best, irrelevant to their professional lives. This is in direct
contrast (discontinuity) to the first-year teachers, Kory and
Sally, and the other experienced teachers, Mary, Jan, Xanthe,
and Judy, as outlined in the previous section. It is noteworthy
that these experienced teachers (Tia and Barbara) represent
the independent and state systems, but this appears to make
no difference to their perception of the standards documents
as having little influence on how they perform their roles.
Perhaps these teachers do not wish to gain any further
promotions.
Passive resistance from teachers is also noticeable when
dealing with demands from parents. Janice declares that "it's
a very matter of fact type relationship." These sentiments are
repeated in other statements such as keeping parents "at
arm's length" and "let the teachers move on with the educa-
tion" (Judy). In such cases, and despite the public rhetoric of
collaboration with parents, the teachers define and position
themselves as professional experts who deserve to have their
expertise recognized. Exasperation is also evident in the
teachers' voices--"just let me teach" (Holly) and "just tell
me what to do and I will do it well" (Jan). As a senior man-
ager, this comment from Jan is noteworthy reiterating her
unresisting acceptance as outlined in the previous section.
Subtle Resistance
The second subtly nuanced form of resistance is where teach-
ers seek to create alternative truth games. In playing the truth
game in a different way, teachers make other options visible
by destabilizing performative discourses. Two examples of
this are evident in the interview data. The first subtle form of
resistance is concerned with teaching as a human endeavor
(Day & Smethem, 2009), involving emotionality on different
levels. Referring to teacher/student professional relation-
ships, interviewees speak of love and care for their students
as well as passion for teaching their disciplines. Common
statements that illustrate the latter notion are "each teacher
has to show their passion" (Barney), "they have got to love
what they are doing" (Janice), and "you have to have a pas-
sion for teaching" (Mike). Passion is not just expressed in
general teaching terms but also about having a passion
toward students, as shown when Barney speaks of a "love of
students . . . you genuinely care about young people"; "you
treat them as individuals" (Kate); and "build their confi-
dence" (Xanthe). The lexical linking across these statements
is one of care. These teachers' sense of professionalism is
internally ascribed; an intrinsic motivation to do their best in
the interests of the students in their care, and this is the model
that they see as the most appropriate for guiding their profes-
sional practice. What is noteworthy is that four out of the five
teachers quoted above have higher degree qualifications and
have been teaching for longer than 20 years. This is in con-
trast (discontinuity) to Jan, with an undergraduate qualifica-
tion and less than 10 years' experience, who still maintains
that each teacher needs to "[have] some discussion about . . .
their performance."
Furthermore, teachers declare and practice altruism, self-
sacrifice, and conscientiousness as shown by statements such
as "putting the job first" (Cecilia) and "ensuring that they
[students] have the best possible and best educational experi-
ence that you can provide" (James). Once again, both these
teachers have more than 20 years of experience. However,
the emotional dimension of teaching as alluded to in these
teachers'overlapping statements is not included in performa-
tive policy documents, as it is neither quantifiable nor audit-
able. Whereas governments promote managerial practices
and a construction of professionalism that values rationality
where the emphasis is on being competitive (Bourke,
2011)--exemplified in Xanthe's earlier comment, "20%
Bourke et al. 7
were under national benchmark"--these teachers maintain a
subject position where a moral dimension of professionalism
is prioritized over the performance agenda.
The second subtle form of playing the truth game differ-
ently to destabilize the dominant performative discourse
includes participants' references to specialized knowledge.
According to participants, teachers need to be "thorough in
their understanding of their subject area" (Barney), "up-to-
date with developments in their subject area" (Xanthe), and
have "a great deal of expertise and knowledge in their area of
teaching" (Holly). Furthermore, Mike describes the need to
be "competent" and "confident" in a discipline area. Policy
documents such as the National Professional Standards for
Teachers (AITSL, 2011) or its predecessor, the Professional
Standards for Queensland Teachers (QCT, 2006), both refer
to "content" knowledge, with a clear intimation that knowing
centrally defined "content" and how to teach it has priority
over any specific teacher specialist expertise. Thus, both of
these documents construct the parameters of teachers' work-
ing knowledge as "content"; content that is prescribed in a
National Curriculum or the c2c agenda in Queensland.
Furthermore, through accreditation procedures, this con-
struction shapes teacher education to produce new kinds of
teachers imbued with new approved forms of knowledge.
The responses from Kory and Sally and their training in a
discourse of professional standards are testimony to this.
However, the statement from Holly (a first-year teacher but
also the daughter of a long experienced teacher and teacher
educator) reveals a discontinuity as she does not share the
sentiments of the other newly qualified teachers.
Overt Resistance
The next area, a more overt form of resistance, questions the
efficacy of change agendas, particularly in relation to the
areas of curriculum change and high-stakes testing regimes,
technologies associated with performance. Many statements
reveal the overwhelming feelings of frustration toward guid-
ing authorities because of the number and frequency of
changes being imposed. Statements that demonstrate this
include "there are rapid changes in curriculum affecting
Queensland schools" (James); "Queensland schools are in a
spin" (Jan); "changing too many things too quickly"
(Xanthe); "let's try 15 things at once, then going onto the
next without bedding down something properly" (Janice);
and, "we've got state agendas and national agendas and
teachers are, you know, constantly being asked to revise
things" (James). These common statements with repetitive
terms such as "rapid changes," "in a spin," "too many . . . too
quickly," and "15 things at once" indicate total exasperation
accompanied by overt resistance, further expressed by James
in the following statement: "I don't even think teachers are
taking it [change] on board any more." James's comment
reveals defiance on the behalf of teachers where they openly
ignore directives. On the other hand, discontinuities exist in
the acknowledgment that "we have had to develop a program
to ensure our students are prepared in regards to literacy"
(Judy) and "although time-consuming, you definitely need to
use data from high-stakes tests" (Judy). However, the use of
definitive terms such as "we have had to" and "you definitely
need to," together with statements such as "with national
tests, people just feel that they are constantly being checked
up on," indicate that surveillance and work intensification
lead to further overt forms of resistance particularly by the
veterans. Kory observes, " . . . older teachers just giving up."
Although this could be dismissed as merely the result of
teacher burn-out, references to the rhetoric of care elsewhere
in the interviews suggest the alternative interpretation of
teachers clinging to more moral forms of professionalism
that they see as more beneficial for students. They might also
be influenced by the inconclusive and sometimes contradic-
tory evidence globally to support performance regimes in
improving student outcomes (Clotfelter, Ladd, & Vigdor,
2010; Lustick, 2011).
Assertive Resistance
The fourth area of resistance is concerned with teachers
asserting their own professional confidence and competence.
Participants' responses reveal that many are engaged in pur-
suing higher degree qualifications that encourage critical
reflexivity of both themselves and of the practices they are
subjected to. Statements to reveal this include the following:
"I keep up my reading in what is going on," "getting hold of
articles" (Holly), "current publications, current writings"
(Barbara), "studying, doing a Masters, a qualification more
than a degree" (Mary), and "doing extra qualifications"
(Xanthe). These statements illustrate how some teachers
commit to research and higher degree activities to add reflex-
ivity, depth, and quality to their practice. Being an expert
with specialized knowledge is an assertive form of resistance
where one can do more than parrot a curriculum--one can
manipulate the knowledge and use it to critique and be con-
fident and competent in one's own practice. With the excep-
tion of Holly (a discontinuity), all these teachers have a
higher degree.
However, professional reflection/learning has been lim-
ited by some schools permitting professional development
only when the learning experiences are based on the stan-
dards and fulfill the performance agenda. Common state-
ments to show this include "We can only go to professional
development if it fits with the standards" (Xanthe) and "I
wanted to go to a workshop on de-stressing, but because it is
not in the standards, I was not allowed to go" (Jean). These
statements such as "we can only go" and "I was not allowed
to go" reveal how professional development is reduced to the
notions of professionalism or professional learning as
defined in standards documents, thus limiting professional
autonomy. A key element of asserting professional confi-
dence and competence and thus professional autonomy is
8 SAGE Open
self-reflection. Teachers include reflection as part of their
regime of truth to critically analyze their own practice so that
they can develop professionally and improve student out-
comes. Reflection is described by interviewees as giving
them "vision" (Janice), "realiz[ing] I had to change that prac-
tice" (Xanthe), and reflecting on "what works, what doesn't
work, what I could do better" (Genevieve). In the National
Professional Standards for Teachers (AITSL, 2011, p. 2),
teachers are required to use the standards for "self reflec-
tion." This suggests that reflection is reduced to what is pre-
scribed in the standards documents only. In this document,
"reflecting" is more commonly replaced by "reviewing" and
"evaluating," revealing a managerial and performative dis-
course of professionalism. In stark contrast, the construction
of reflection by teachers aligns with Schön's (1983) ideas of
the reflective practitioner and a more practical discourse of
professionalism. According to Ryan and Bourke (2012), it is
crucial to include the element of reflexivity (critical reflec-
tion) in any representation of professionalism to foreground
the importance of understanding the ways in which teachers
mediate their subjective and objective circumstances and
make the decisions that they do.
As already mentioned, performativity also generates
accountability claims from parents; however, the following
statements exemplify a second form of assertive resistance
where teachers make decisions as professionals even if par-
ents disagree: "I had to show him . . . that I knew what I was
doing and that I was working in the best interests of his
daughter" (Tia) and "if you can explain things very clearly
for them then they go away and, they can accept what you are
doing" (James). The use of definitive statements such as "I
had to show him" and "they can accept what you are doing"
highlight teachers asserting their expertise in didactic rather
than dialectic forms of communication. Once again, these
notions contrast with policy documents such as the National
Professional Standards for Teachers (AITSL, 2011), which
give parents a loud voice rather than allowing teachers as
professionals to get on with the job at hand (Bourke, 2011).
Aspirational Resistance
The final area identified in these data, aspirational resistance,
is evident as the teachers propose an alternative to the regula-
tory control of management and the performance agenda--
that is, educational leadership. Participants mention how
important the principal's leadership qualities are to the suc-
cess of the school, but they also value shared leadership
opportunities. This is revealed in comments such as "I
believe strongly in shared leadership" (Kate), "sharing deci-
sion-making, collaboration" (Sue), and "all teachers in some
way have a leadership role: it's part of being a professional"
(Sue). Both these teachers are experienced leaders in schools,
and their comments contrast strongly with the construction
of leadership in the National Professional Standards for
Teachers (AITSL, 2011), which is not really concerned with
leadership, but rather management and performance, repre-
sented linguistically by the use of verbs such as to "evaluate"
(p. 17), to "monitor" (p. 11), to "revise" (p. 8), and to
"review" (p. 9). Once again, this highlights the regulatory
nature of such documents, promoting a managerial and per-
formative discourse of professionalism. Teachers' responses
reveal an aspirational resistance highlighting autonomy,
sharing in decision making and being considered an equal
partner, notions that align with traditional professionalism
discourses rather than the privileged voice of performance in
policy documents.
Discussion
The data analyzed here reveal a number of continuities and
discontinuities (similarities and differences; Foucault, 1972)
within and between the varying themes. Although the overall
responses reveal a binary of compliance versus resistance
(even if somewhat unbalanced), there are various reasons as
to why teachers comply with the performance agenda and
varying (even intensifying) degrees and forms of resistance
to such policies and practices.
Within the first theme, unresisting acceptance, Kory and
Sally are indicative of a new transformed generation in
Queensland whose initial teacher education training has been
based on the professional standards discourse of profession-
alism. Young Queensland teachers do not stand alone in this
respect but are indicative of similar happenings in other
countries. Writing about experiences in the United Kingdom,
where the performance agenda invaded education at an ear-
lier date, Furlong et al. (2000) claim that
the assumption behind policy within this area [professionalism]
has been that changes in the form and content of initial teacher
education will . . . serve to construct a new generation of teachers
with different forms of knowledge, different skills and different
professional values. (p. 6)
In these cases, performative policy technologies promoted
through universities are reshaping the professional educator
in a discourse of trainability (Beck, 2008, 2009), where new
teachers comply with performative practices without even
questioning them. The new policies are aimed at producing a
new reality of professionalism to serve political and eco-
nomic interests. The result is "control," "management," and
"discipline" of new teachers; in other words, "training"
rather than "educating" new teachers with "specialized
knowledge," "leadership," and "reflective" qualities.
Compliance for Mary, Jan, Xanthe, and Judy could also
be the result of not questioning, or it could simply be that to
keep their jobs they must fulfill what is in their job
Bourke et al. 9
descriptions. Rather than compliance or professionalism,
some might interpret this transformation as careerism or pro-
motion seeking. Helsby (1995) argues that professionalism is
a social construct and, therefore, teachers play a key role in
what they resist and what they accept. These teachers may
have accepted compliance as an inevitable part of their jobs.
Australia is not the first country where the second theme
is evident: teachers ignoring policy in a passive form of
resistance. Results from a survey in the United Kingdom in
2010 carried out by the General Teaching Council for
England revealed that more than half the teachers inter-
viewed were not aware of the professional standards for
teaching or their purpose (Poet, Rudd, & Smith, 2010)
despite the fact that the standards were first implemented in
1997 and then further revisited and revised in 2007. From
these findings in the United Kingdom, Evans (2011) came to
the conclusion that perhaps governments are still not suc-
ceeding in "call[ing] the shots when it comes to shaping pro-
fessionalism" (Evans, 2011, p. 864). Evans (2011) claims
that teachers will resist changes being imposed on them,
especially if they perceive the change as haphazard or "no
better" than the status quo.
In the third theme, teachers are transformed by subtly
repositioning themselves in active, alternative discourses by
including emotionality and intellectuality in their regime of
truth on professionalism. The former is not included in pol-
icy documents as it cannot be scrutinized, measured, or regu-
lated. In Osgood's (2006) words, the teachers in this study
"muddy the water" (p. 12) by performing their professional-
ism differently. At the beginning of the 1990s, Ball (1990,
p. 223) asserted that beliefs (emotionality) were an "older,
increasingly displaced discourse," no longer important in
teaching. In 2003, he continued by saying that personal
beliefs such as commitment were substituted by calculation,
and value replaced values (Ball, 2003; Day & Smethem,
2009). Around the same time, others such as Hanlon (1998,
p. 59) also suggested that there was less "elbow room at the
table" for traditional discourses as they were not relevant in
the corporatized market of education. However, more than
20 years later, the discourse of emotionality (Osgood, 2006)
still forms a subtle resistance to the performance agenda.
The reality of teaching for the teachers in this study needs
emotion and a sense of "vocation" (Blackmore, 2004). For
these teachers, a list of competencies or a prescribed curricu-
lum cannot possibly represent all the complexities of context
and relationships that occur in everyday teaching situations.
Even though policy documents may give the rational perfor-
mative discourse a loud voice, the dominant notion spoken
by these teachers' voices reveals resistance and protests
loudly for the heart and soul to be left in teaching. These
teachers do not suffer from "values schizophrenia" (Ball,
2003, p. 221). Commitment, judgment, and authenticity
within practice are not substituted for impression and fabri-
cations of performance.
In relation to specialized knowledge, policies and prac-
tices construct teachers as technicians "enacting pre-defined
`best practice' with a pre-defined curriculum, a situation for
which skill, but not intelligence is required" (Connell, 2009,
p. 224). These teachers, however, alternatively construct a
transformed discourse of intellectuality and support the find-
ings from Connell (2009). She argues that, as part of the job
of a teacher is to interpret the world for his or her students, a
great deal of intellectual work is needed and therefore spe-
cialized knowledge. Connell's thoughts are congruent with
those of Evans' (2011), who argues that policy documents
such as those promoting teacher standards focus on what
teachers do (behavioral) rather than what they think (intel-
lectual) and the attitudes they hold (attitudinal). For the
teachers in this study, following a list of competencies that
promotes "content" knowledge is far removed from the intel-
lectual work that Connell and Evans are referring to. Instead,
these teachers promote "designerly" ways of knowing where
they carve their own choices rather than becoming "dwarfed
and deformed" (Chua, 2009, p. 161) by performance
indicators.
In the fourth theme, an overt form of resistance, these
teachers openly ignore certain directives. Whereas regula-
tory authorities envisage accountability in the form of high-
stakes testing regimes increasing productivity, the teachers in
this study see such mechanisms as causing unnecessary
stress, frustration, and work overload. According to
McCulloch, Helsby, and Knight (2000),
Educational improvement depends on teachers wanting to make a
difference. It depends upon their feeling professional. Neither
raising standards by regulation nor professionalising by
prescription will work. Teachers have power in the sense that they
have to want improvement for improvement to happen. (p. 118)
Here, teachers show evidence of resisting change more
overtly in light of the consequences it has for their working
conditions, which is not tempered by any positive outcome
for students.
Many writers have made reference to the fifth theme,
assertive resistance. Evans (2011) argues that enacted pro-
fessionalism is the key to understanding and promoting high-
quality teaching in real terms. This form of professionalism
sees teachers undertaking professional development (in
many forms) and then making decisions about what they
enact to improve practice and outcomes. Ifanti and
Fotopoulopou (2011), along with Beauchamp and Thomas
(2009), similarly cite the importance of professional devel-
opment as teachers transform their own identities as profes-
sionals in unique ways.Thus, the "transformed" professionals
10 SAGE Open
are reflexive professionals who can map out and justify their
own professional development with regard to their own sub-
jective interests and motivations, along with the objective
needs of their students, the profession, and the communities
in which they work. The autonomous and reflexive profes-
sional is more likely to enact and sustain the discourses of
quality teaching than the one who simply follows govern-
ment mandated performative discourses with a tick-box
mentality (Ryan & Bourke, 2012). Osgood (2006) asserts
that teachers need to maintain their professional integrity and
have professional confidence to find "wriggle room" (Hoyle
& Wallace, 2009) so that they can do their jobs irrespective
of the external mandates in government documents and the
demands from parents. The teachers in this study are critical
of imposed accountability and maintain their own licensed
autonomy (Osgood, 2006) rather than becoming "ontologi-
cally insecure" (Ball, 2003, p. 220). Twenty-three years ago,
Ball maintained that standards reform agendas were a direct
threat to professional integrity (Ball, 1990), but here we see
teachers promoting their own discursive truths to subvert the
hegemonic performative discourses that position them dif-
ferently. Ball (1990) also claimed that professional judgment
was subordinate to performativity in the new market regime,
but once again, this is not the message coming from the
teachers in this study.
In the last theme, aspirational resistance, teachers'
voices are amplified on the concept of shared leadership.
The teachers' notions of leadership all but contradict the
construction of management and performativity within the
newest Australian managerial policy documents. Instead,
collective autonomy is seen as integral to their work as pro-
fessionals. These thoughts are shared by many authors over
many years such as Purvis (1973), Hoyle (1974), Travers
and Rebore (1990), Goodson and Hargreaves (1996),
Quicke (2000), Furlong et al. (2000), and Leaton Gray and
Whitty (2010), who all agree that without autonomy, teach-
ers cannot experiment in new approaches. If teachers are
restricted to the management and performative discourse
evident in policy documents, then their own capacities to
become transformative leaders in creativity (Burnard &
White, 2008) and moral choice are compromised. Many
teachers in this study wish to be free to share in their deci-
sion making for the best interests of their students. In this
way, a collaborative model of leadership results where
teachers share a sense of purpose and responsibility. This
collegial authority or "group trust" (Burnard & White,
2008, p. 673) demands trust from employers rather than
management. For more than 40 years, Queensland teachers
had that trust.
Conclusion
We have identified six responses to emerging performa-
tivity agendas that in the current climate are potentially
inimical to the improvement of the educational endeavor
that politicians, policy makers, and pedagogues purport to
promote. Professionalism was a positive, seen as a dis-
course of resistance or the "enemy" of economic rational-
ism and the discourse of performativity (Sanguinetti,
2000, p. 241). Now, however, the notion has been hijacked
and remodeled by neoliberal governments to promote
their redefined version--a performative professionalism.
Our archaeological excavation provides empirical evi-
dence that teachers are not necessarily playing the same
truth game but rather reinterpreting definitions of profes-
sionalism emerging from policy makers in a traditional
image--ways that maintain their individual freedom and
personal practical beliefs. The data reported in this article
reveal pockets of resistance emerging as teachers ignore,
subvert, oppose, redefine, and construct counter-dis-
courses toward forms of performative professionalism
with which they are uncomfortable. Hoyle and Wallace
(2009) have speculated that despite the advance of the
performance agenda, the worthwhile elements of tradi-
tional discourses survive in many schools. Our excava-
tions, rather than speculating, provide evidence for this.
Teachers in this study describe various ways of playing
the maelstrom of professionalism and performativity
games differently, in what we now term a "new classical/
practical discourse of professionalism." It is imperative
for teachers to be daring, courageous, and reflexive, not
compliant (Burnard & White, 2008).
It remains to be seen whether the young compliant minds
being churned out by the university "machines" retain their
acceptance of the performance agenda, or with increasing
maturity and practical experience in classrooms assert the
very individuality that has been the traditional hallmark of
learned professions.
