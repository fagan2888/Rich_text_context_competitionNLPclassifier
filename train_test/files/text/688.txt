DataWatch
Do HMOs Care For The Chronically Ill?
by Teresa Fama, Peter D. Fox, and Leigh Ann White
Abstract: This DataWatch refutes the notion that chronic illness is more prevalent among persons
covered by indemnity insurance than by health maintenance organizations (HMOs). This is true even
when health status and sociodemographic factors are accounted for in the analysis. The study analyzes
the prevalence ofchronic illness among privately insured nonelderly persons in HMOs and indemnity
plans, using data from the 1992 National Health Interview Survey. More data are needed to examine
this issue for Medicare and Medicaid populations.
There is a perception that persons with chronic illness are less likely
to receive their health care from health maintenance organizations
(HMOs) than through indemnity plans.1 However, few studies have
systematically tested whether this perception is valid. Studies that have done
so have either used old data or focused exclusively on the elderly. It is
important to quantify the validity of this perception in an environment
increasingly dominated by managed care, because its validity has implica-
tions for how well a health system dominated by managed care can meet the
needs of the chronically ill. To explore this issue, we analyzed data from the
1992 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Our analysis is limited to
the privately insured, noninstitutionalized population under age sixty-five.3
Approximately 68 percent of all persons with chronic conditions, defined
as persons with a chronic disease, a mobility limitation, or a sensory or
cognitive limitation, are in this age group.
The issue of biased selection is closely related to whether the proportion
of people with chronic conditions is similar in HMOs and indemnity plans.
Do chronically ill persons disproportionately elect indemnity plans when
given a choice, fearing that the services in HMOs are inadequate? A
considerable and still evolving literature exists on the subject of biased
selection. This literature yields contradictory findings at times, in part
because selection bias may exist under some circumstances and not others.4
This analysis was not intended to focus on biased selection; however, the

results might shed light on the issue.
Data and methods. The data for this paper come from public use files of
the 1992 NHIS, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS). The survey was administered to 128,412 persons in 51,643 house-
holds. Information on type of health insurance coverage and private health
insurance characteristics was collected for each person in the household. In
7,822 cases insurance coverage was unknown or not ascertained; we omit-
ted these cases from the analyses. Because the questionnaire did not ask
whether persons age sixty-five and older were enrolled in HMOs, elderly
persons (15,370 cases) also were excluded. The remainder were known to
be covered by private insurance or by government programs (Medicare,
Medicaid, and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed
Services [CHAMPUS]). Anyone who did not report being covered by any
government program or by any type of private insurance was classified as
uninsured.
NCHS staff verified the type of private insurance by comparing the plan
name and type reported by survey respondents with the plan name and type
from a list compiled by NCHS. We dropped all cases in which the response
was not congruent with listed plan types. In many cases, the respondent
named a private plan that was not on the precoded list. These "unverified"
responses were analyzed only if the type of plan was reported.
In many instances persons who were covered by private insurance re-
ported being covered by more than one plan type. If the person was covered
by two or more plans of the same type (for example, all indemnity or all
HMO), then we assigned the person to the appropriate category. If, how-
ever, the person reported being covered by two different private plan types,
we dropped the case. Finally, because the analysis focused on comparisons
of indemnity and HMO coverage, we dropped cases in which persons were
enrolled in preferred provider organizations (PPOs).
This process of omitting irrelevant cases and nonresponses left us a total
of 98,940 records for analysis: 40,956 persons were covered by indemnity
plans and 19,575 persons by HMOs. The remaining persons either were
covered by public insurance or were not insured (Exhibit 1).
Statistical differences in means and proportions for indemnity plans and
HMOs were tested using t-tests. Multivariate regression analysis also was
performed to examine the relative likelihood of a person's being enrolled in
an HMO compared with being in an indemnity plan.

only and HMOs only. Information on all nonelderly persons in the sample
(that is, those in indemnity plans; HMOs; PPOs; a combination of indem-
nity plans, HMOs, or PPOs; Medicare; Medicaid; other public programs;
and CHAMPUS; and those who are uninsured) is included as a reference.
The major finding is the lack of substantive differences in most of the
demographic characteristics of indemnity plan members and HMO mem-
bers. Among these two groups, the only substantive differences are in the
percentage of nonwhite members and in the percentage of members who
live in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA). In particular, 17.6 percent of
HMO enrollees are nonwhite, compared with 10.2 percent of persons in
indemnity plans. With respect to geographic location, 91.3 percent of
HMO enrollees live in MSAs, compared with 743 percent of persons in
indemnity plans. This is not surprising, given that HMOs are typically
located in densely populated areas, for a variety of reasons.5
There are statistically significant differences (at the .05 level) in the
means or proportions of some of the other variables. For example, HMO
enrollees come from slightly larger families and are slightly younger than
persons covered by indemnity plans.
Prevalence of chronic conditions. The NHIS includes questions per-
taining to a wide range of conditions that are classified as "chronic." Exhibit
2 includes only those conditions that are likely to be associated with a
long-term functional impairment, such as arthritis or diabetes. We ex-
cluded conditions such as trouble with dry skin, chronic sinusitis, and
frequent indigestion that rarely meet this definition. Thus, we compared
the prevalence of fifteen chronic conditions among persons in HMOs and
persons in indemnity plans, controlling for age.
Again, the most striking finding is how little HMOs and indemnity plans
differ in the prevalence of chronic conditions. The most substantive differ-
ences pertained to arthritis, selected respiratory conditions, hearing impair-
ments, and orthopedic impairments or deformities. The differences that do
exist are in both directions, and only the difference in the prevalence of
hearing impairments is statistically significant. Arthritis is less prevalent
among persons under age forty-five who are enrolled in HMOs compared
with those in indemnity plans. Among all age groups, hearing impairments
are much less prevalent in HMOs than in indemnity plans. The prevalence
of orthopedic impairments or deformities among persons under age forty-
five in HMOs is greater than in indemnity plans, but the opposite is true for
persons ages forty-five to sixty-four. Among selected respiratory conditions,
findings are mixed. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are less prevalent
in HMOs among all age groups, except among persons ages forty-five to
sixty-four in the case of chronic bronchitis. Asthma is more prevalent
among all age groups in HMOs compared with indemnity plans.

Activity limitations, bed days, and self-reported health status. Be-
cause there is wide variation in the use of services by patients with similar
chronic conditions, we examined three additional measures: degree of
activity limitations, number of bed days in the past year, and self-reported
health status. The two latter measures have been shown to be predictive of
important health changes (that is, major or minor hospitalization, major
illness) between baseline and one year later among healthy older adults.6
The percentage of persons with any activity limitation is slightly higher
in indemnity plans than in HMOs (Exhibit 3). Irrespective of age, HMO
enrollees are less likely than persons in indemnity plans to have a limitation
in a major activity. However, HMO enrollees under age eighteen are more
likely than children in indemnity plans to have a limitation in a major
activity and to be unable to perform a major activity.
The distribution of bed days, regardless of age, is similar. Slightly more

On the other hand, a greater percentage of persons in indemnity plans had
more than thirty bed days compared with the percentage in HMOs.
More than three-quarters of respondents in both indemnity plans and
HMOs rated their health as excellent or very good (Exhibit 4). While the
percentage of respondents rating their health status as fair or poor in both
groups was small, slightly more persons in indemnity plans than in HMOs
rated their health as poor.

(indemnity plan or HMO) is dichotomous. Space precludes a complete
presentation of these results.7 Significant effects were found for age, race,
education, marital status, number of family members, income, residential
location, self-reported health status, and number of bed days: ( 1 ) Compared
with persons ages nineteen to forty-four, persons over age forty-four are
more likely to be in indemnity plans; (2) nonwhite persons are less likely to
be in indemnity plans; (3) compared with persons in households headed by
someone with a high school education, persons in households headed by
someone with sixteen or more years of education are more likely to be in
indemnity plans; (4) married persons are more likely to be in indemnity
plans; (5) compared with singles, families with three or more members are
less likely to be in indemnity plans; (6) compared with persons with
incomes of $20,000 to $49,999, persons with incomes below $20,000 are
more likely to be in indemnity plans; (7) persons who live in MSAs are less
likely to be in indemnity plans; (8) compared with persons who rate their
health as good, persons who rate their health as very good or as poor are
more likely to be in indemnity plans; and (9) compared with persons

having no bed days over the previous year, persons having one or more bed
days are less likely to be in indemnity plans.
The largest effects were found for race, residential location (MSA/non-
MSA), and poor health status, although the 95 percent confidence interval
on the comparison of poor health status is large. The variables pertaining to
the presence of an activity limitation or specific chronic conditions or the
number of chronic conditions are not significant.
Discussion
This analysis refutes the notion that chronic illness is more prevalent
among nonelderly persons covered by indemnity insurance than among
those covered by HMOs. Although some differences were identified, the
central finding relates to the similarities. Furthermore, where differences do
exist, they occur in both directions; that is, HMOs have proportionately
fewer persons with chronic illness than indemnity plans have when some
measures are used, and have more such persons when other measures are
used.
Our study was not motivated by the desire to determine the existence of
biased selection, but it does shed some light on this complex issue. If HMOs
do benefit from favorable selection, we believe that the bias is minimal
overall, although in some situations it could be significant--to either the
advantage or the disadvantage of the HMO. One could also conclude that
HMOs have been no more successful than indemnity plans have been at
risk selection. Unfortunately, the NHIS data do not allow us to identify risk
differences among persons with a choice of plans.
These findings pertain only to the privately insured nonelderly popula-
tion. Additional current data are needed to examine whether persons with
chronic conditions who are covered by Medicare or Medicaid are more or
less likely to join HMOs. A study funded by the Health Care Financing
Administration (HCFA) that compared Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs
with those in traditional fee-for-service plans found that HMO enrollees
were more likely to be healthy.8 However, since that study there has been a
dramatic increase in Medicare HMO enrollment. In particular, enrollment
in Medicare full risk-based HMOs increased by almost one million between
1990 (the year on which the HCFA data are based) and 1994.9
With respect to Medicaid enrollment in HMOs, most states have ex-
empted persons with severe disabilities from managed care arrangements,
and some states are just beginning to experiment with methods (most of
which pertain to setting payment rates) for including such persons.10 It is
not known, however, whether Medicaid eligibles who have chronic condi-
tions but are not severely disabled are more or less likely to join HMOs.

HMO enrollment continues to increase rapidly, and more and more
states are turning to Medicaid managed care arrangements. In 1994 alone
three million Medicaid eligibles were enrolled in prepaid health systems, an
increase of about 60 percent over the previous year.11 It is important to
enhance our understanding of how best to serve people with chronic
conditions and other populations in a managed care environment and to
demonstrate how capitation might offer opportunities for innovation in
service delivery and care coordination.
