Broad global trends suggest that economic inequality, at
its historic peak according to some metrics (Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2014;
Piketty & Saez, 2014), is a pressing societal problem
impacting the health and well-being of individuals: In
roughly 70% of studies examining the health impacts of
economic inequality, data indicate that societal health
worsens as economic inequality intensifies (Wilkinson &
Pickett, 2006, 2009). When economic inequality deepens
on a societal scale, the evidence suggests that it is both
societies and individuals that suffer.
In addition to its apparent relationship to well-being,
the way in which economic inequality shapes the psy-
chological experiences of individuals is a topic of grow-
ing interest in the social and economic sciences, where
research examines how people explain or justify inequal-
ity (Kraus, Piff, & Keltner, 2009; Shariff, Wiwad, & Aknin,
2016), whether people are aware of its magnitude
(Davidai & Gilovich, 2015; Norton & Ariely, 2011), and if
inequality influences behavior (DeCelles & Norton, 2016).
In this article, we take a unique approach in that we
examine economic inequality as it is experienced by
individuals in their everyday interactions with others.
Integrating insights from research on social comparison
processes (Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002; Taylor &
Lobel, 1989) and on status signaling (Ambady & Rosenthal,
1993; Sapolsky, 2005), we suggest that economic inequal-
ity is experienced daily as the communication of social
class signals--behaviors that provide information about a
person's income, educational attainment, or occupation
status (Bourdieu, 1984; Kraus & Keltner, 2009; Veblen,
1899/1973)--perceived and expressed in everyday inter-
actions. In this article, we consolidate findings from the
psychological and economic sciences to derive three
basic predictions about social class signaling and the
experience of inequality. Specifically, we theorize that
class signals (a) occur frequently, rapidly, and accurately
in the social perception process; (b) augment group
boundaries between the haves and have nots in society;
and (c) elicit psychological processes and behaviors that
justify and maintain the current economic system (see

Signs of Social Class: The Experience of
Economic Inequality in Everyday Life

Abstract
By some accounts, global economic inequality is at its highest point on record. The pernicious effects of this broad
societal trend are striking: Rising inequality is linked to poorer health and well-being across countries, continents,
and cultures. The economic and psychological forces that perpetuate inequality continue to be studied, and in this
theoretical review, we examine the role of daily experiences of economic inequality--the communication of social class
signals between interaction partners--in this process. We theorize that social class signals activate social comparison
processes that strengthen group boundaries between the haves and have nots in society. In particular, we argue
that class signals are a frequent, rapid, and accurate component of person perception, and we provide new data
and analyses demonstrating the accuracy of class signaling in 60-s interactions, Facebook photographs, and isolated
recordings of brief speech. We suggest that barriers to the reduction of economic inequality in society arise directly
from this class signaling process through the augmentation of class boundaries and the elicitation of beliefs and
behaviors that favor the economic status quo.

Fig. 1). Throughout, we detail existing evidence for each
of these predictions and chart the future directions they
suggest.
For the purpose of this article, it is important to dwell
on the definition of social class, which we and others
have defined in the past as one's position in the eco-
nomic hierarchy in society that arises from a combination
of annual income, educational attainment, and occupa-
tion prestige (Adler etal., 1994; Oakes & Rossi, 2003).
Though the experience of social class is shaped by this
economic positioning, the actual impact of the construct
on social and psychological experience is wide-ranging
and multifaceted: Social class shapes behavior through
cultural learning, such as socialization processes occur-
ring within a family whose members share a similar
socioeconomic background, and through social-cognitive
mechanisms, which include habitual response patterns to
an experience that is unique to a particular social class
(e.g., Fiske & Markus, 2012). Social class can also deter-
mine the groups an individual interacts with and belongs
to (Lareau & Conley, 2008). Because of its many facets, it
is helpful to conceptualize social class (like race) as a
"bundle of sticks" that can be disaggregated and studied
based on its specific elements (i.e., Sen & Wasow, 2016).
Signaling is the specific element of social class we exam-
ine in this article, with an eye toward better understand-
ing how class signals might shape processes related to
the creation of class boundaries, perceptions and experi-
ences of class mobility, and self-perceptions of an indi-
vidual's own socioeconomic position in society.
We believe our approach in this article represents a
significant advance in how researchers examine eco-
nomic inequality. Prior studies have examined economic
inequality through the lens of a global economy (e.g.,
Piketty, 2015); as an economic trend perceived by indi-
viduals (e.g., Kluegel & Smith, 1986); or indirectly through
an examination of the association between social class
position and emotion, cognition, or behavior (e.g., Kohn,
1963; Kraus, Tan, & Tannenbaum, 2013). Moving forward
from this prior work, we examine economic inequality as
the daily process of comparing one's own socioeconomic
standing to that of others based on the dynamic observa-
tion of observable behaviors that signal social class. Such
an approach has several direct benefits: This approach
expands our understanding of the experience of eco-
nomic inequality beyond the economic realm to include
the dynamic social signaling processes it informs, it
allows for a fuller understanding of the process by which
people come to accurately perceive their own social class
position in society relative to others (e.g., Goodman
etal., 2001; Hout, 2008), and it provides a framework for
understanding the processes by which economic inequal-
ity might perpetuate itself over time.
Signs of Social Class
From primates to fiddler crabs, individuals across species
signal their broadly defined social status with nonverbal
behaviors (Hall, Coats, & LeBeau, 2005; Sapolsky, 2005;

2005; Gregory & Webster, 1996; Ko, Sadler, & Galinsky,
2015), and social symbols (Veblen, 1899/1973). These
status symbols assist individuals in avoiding costly aggres-
sive encounters or in aligning with others who have the
material resources necessary to facilitate group living
(e.g., Ambady & Rosenthal, 1993; Zahavi & Zahavi, 1999).
In humans, symbols of status are used in a variety of
contexts--for instance, to signal physical dominance
(Kraus & Chen, 2013) or as cues of achieved success
(Tracy & Matsumoto, 2008). Aligning directly with this
past research, we assert that social class is a form of soci-
etal social status that is signaled and perceived accurately
in interactions with others (e.g., Kraus & Keltner, 2009).
Our first prediction that social class signaling occurs
during social perception is supported by two separate
lines of research. First, research on social comparison, or
the process of comparing oneself to other people on
social characteristics and outcomes (Festinger, 1954; Taylor
& Lobel, 1989), indicates that people compare themselves
to others frequently on economic dimensions. Social
comparison is often referred to as an unavoidable aspect
of perception during social interactions (Brickman & Bul-
man, 1977; Brown, Ferris, Heller, & Keeping, 2007), and
it functions as a means by which individuals gather infor-
mation about the self, regulate their emotions and goals,
manage uncertainty, and judge the normalcy of personal
life events (e.g., Taylor & Lobel, 1989). Though compari-
sons occur on many dimensions in social relationships,
evidence indicates that these comparisons are frequently
tuned to economic outcomes: For instance, reward
regions of the brain (e.g., the left ventral striatum) were
activated when engaging in comparison with an experi-
ment partner who received a relatively lower monetary
reward rather than an equal reward (Fliessbach etal.,
2007). In another study, the tendency for nurses to have
a high social comparison orientation--was positively
associated with reports of relative deprivation or feelings
of reduced resources relative to others (Buunk, Zurriaga,
Gonzalez-Roma, & Subirats, 2003).
Second, studies of social class signaling indicate that
perceivers can rapidly and accurately judge the social
class of others based on only small amounts of informa-
tion. Theoretical accounts of social class suggest that it
shapes people's lives in persistent and enduring ways by
constraining or expanding access via levels of economic
resources or by shaping behavior through cultural and
psychological means (Bourdieu, 1984; Fiske & Markus,
2012; Kraus, Piff, Mendoza-Denton, Rheinschmidt, &
Keltner, 2012). Studies generally support this assertion:
Class determines the foods people eat (Monisaivis &
Drewnowski, 2009), the music and art they enjoy (DiMaggio
& Useem, 1978; Peterson & Kern, 1996; Snibbe & Markus,
2005; Van Eijck, 2001), the leisure activities people
engage in (Veblen, 1899/1973), the linguistic patterns
they employ (Labov, 1964, 1990, 2006), and the clothing
they wear (Gillath, Bahns, Ge, & Crandall, 2012). This
analysis suggests that when people engage in social
interactions, some of their behaviors and cultural prac-
tices are infused with social class and, as a result, accu-
rately communicate social class position to observers.
Although several studies indicate class differences in
behavior (e.g., Bernstein, 1962; Lizardo & Skiles, 2015)
and language use (e.g., Labov, 2006) and inform this
work a great deal, relatively few examine the social class
signaling accuracy of these behaviors (see Table 1). For
instance, early work by Davis (1956) found that photo-
graphs of living rooms allowed observers to accurately
judge the occupation status and education of individuals.
In the realm of appearance, researchers found that social
class can be accurately perceived by strangers based on

such static appearance cues as shoes worn by partici-
pants (Gillath et
al., 2012), employee photographs
(Schmid Mast & Hall, 2004), and standard facial images
(Bjornsdottir & Rule, 2016). Two additional studies con-
ducted by an author of this manuscript also bear out this
signaling prediction: In the first, 50 university student
dyads (n = 100) were recruited to a laboratory setting
where they had a 5-min "get acquainted" interaction with
a stranger (Kraus & Keltner, 2009). In the second, a study
of cultural practices online, the 20 most recent Facebook
photographs were collected from a sample of 113 univer-
sity students and adults from an online crowdsourcing
platform (i.e., MTurk; Becker, Kraus, & Rheinschmidt-
Same, 2017). In both studies, participants provided infor-
mation about their own family social class by reporting
their annual income, parental educational attainment,
and self-perceived position on a 10-rung ladder repre-
senting ascending levels of income, education, and occu-
pation status (Adler, Epel, Castellazzo, & Ickovics, 2000).
A separate sample of observers then watched the first 60 s
of the "get acquainted" interaction or viewed the Face-
book photographs and estimated participant social class
on the same 10-rung society ladder. Across both studies,
an overall composite metric of social class computed by
averaging the z-scored index of each individual social
class item was significantly positively correlated with per-
ceptions of social class made by observers based only on
60 s of recorded behavior, r(98) = .28, p = .005, or on
viewing 20 Facebook photographs, r(111) = .27, p = .005.
Moreover these associations held after accounting for the
race and gender of participants.
For the purpose of this article, we reanalyzed the data
from these prior studies to determine how well observers
performed in estimating social class above chance guess-
ing. For this analysis, observer estimates were divided
into four quartiles and two halves based on prior research
indicating that the United States is divided into four social
class categories (i.e., lower, working, middle, and upper
class), but that about 90% of people identify with the two
middle categories (Hout, 2008). The overall metric of par-
ticipant social class was also divided into quartiles and
halves. We then compared observer estimates to partici-
pant overall social class. The observer estimates were
considered to be correct if the quartile or half chosen by
observers matched that of participants, whereas mis-
matches were incorrect (e.g., Hertenstein, Holmes,
McCullough, & Keltner, 2009). The results of this analysis
are shown in Figure 2: When compared to chance guess-
ing (i.e., 25% for quartiles, and 50% for halves), observers
performed significantly better than chance when estimat-
ing the correct social class quartile, x2(1)Behavior
= 5.33,
p = .02; x2(1)Facebook
= 5.45, p = .02, and half, x2(1)Behavior
=
4.00, p = .046; x2(1)Facebook
= 4.68, p = .03, of participants
using 60s of recorded behavior or Facebook photo-
graphs. Short dynamic bursts of behavior and cultural
practices shared through photographs on Facebook are
sufficient to accurately signal social class.
One of the most pervasive domains of person percep-
tion is the voice, and much research supports the utility of
aspects of speech--including word choice and linguistic
and paralinguistic vocal patterns--in signaling various
forms of social status. For instance, people modulate their
vocal pitch to make it more consistent with that of high
status individuals (Gregory & Webster, 1996), and power-
ful people use lowered pitch along with other vocal cues
to suggest their physical dominance and authority (Hall
etal., 2005; Ko etal., 2015). We predict that speech style,
even the linguistic and paralinguistic content of speech, is
of considerable utility for perceiving the social class of
others (Bugental, Henker, & Whalen, 1976; Ellis, 1967;
Labov, 2006; Wolfram & Schilling-Estes, 2006). Though
speech style varies by region and cultural background, it
is also determined by social class: For instance, studies
find that students from lower social class backgrounds are
more likely to speak using nonstandard dialects than rela-
tively upper class individuals (Fogel & Ehri, 2000). As
well, discrimination occurs more often against individuals
in the United States with nonstandard dialects (Gluszek &
Dovidio, 2010), and people from traditionally low status
groups in society sometimes code switch away from non-
standard speech to more standard forms in order to blend
in while in high status contexts (Brannon & Markus, 2013;
Labov, 1972, 2006). At the other end of the social class
spectrum, the material resources and opportunities
afforded by high social class (Kraus etal., 2012; Oishi &
Talhelm, 2012) allow individuals to travel and to interact
with others who are well traveled, thereby contributing to
less locally defined and more standard patterns of speech.

426 Kraus et al.
In one example of the social stratification of linguistic
cues, Labov (1972) found that New York City department
store clerks used different pronunciations for the "r" in
words like "floor" and "fourth" based on social class mea-
sured in terms of the prestige of each of the stores. Upon
being asked to repeat their pronunciations, all clerks
tended to emphasize the "r" sound in the words more
than they did in spontaneous speech--a behavior indi-
cating conscious awareness of the class signaling impli-
cations of their speech (Labov, 1972). In other direct
evidence for signaling of social class through speech,
Giles and Sassoon (1983) asked participants to mimic a
Cockney or standard English accent, finding that Cock-
ney accents were judged lower in social class than stan-
dard English ones.
The above analysis suggests that speech style is an
accurate signal of social class even when the semantic
content of speech is held constant. In a new study, we
sought to test the very limits of this assertion by exposing
the brief speech of individuals (i.e., seven words spoken
out of context) to a separate panel of observers with the
prediction that observers would accurately judge social
class based solely on speech style.
To test this hypothesis we used a sample of individual
speakers from across the United States recorded reading
one of two literary passages by the International Dialects
of English Archive (http://dialectsarchive.com). Of the
246 speakers collected by the archive across 48 of the 50
states in the United States, 213 reported their educational
attainment and occupation status, and these speakers
comprised our sample for the signaling analysis. We then
created isolated speech recordings for seven spoken
words--(i.e., "and," "from," "thought," "beautiful," "imag-
ine," "yellow," and "the") chosen because they occurred
in both read passages--for each of the speakers and pre-
sented these recordings to a separate U.S. panel sample of
observers recruited as part of Qualtrics panels (n = 568).
Just as in the prior studies, our observer sample estimated
speaker social class using a 10-rung ladder representing
ascending levels of social class in society (M = 5.85, SD =
0.68). We then compared averaged observer estimates of
social class to a standard composite (M = -0.02, SD =
0.87) of speaker educational attainment, coded based on
four ascending categories (1 = did not finish high school,
2 = high school graduation or some college, 3 = four-year
college graduation, 4 = advanced degree), and occupa-
tion status, coded using an established four digit occupa-
tion status coding scheme (Ganzeboom, De Graaf, &
Treiman, 1992). See the online Supplemental Material for
more detail on the samples, stimuli, and analyses.
The results support our prediction that speech style is
a social class signal. Observers provided judgments of
speaker social class that were significantly positively cor-
related with speaker social class, r(211) = .22, p = .002.
Moreover, this association held after accounting for
speaker characteristics--race, gender, and vocal pitch--
as well as geographic region characteristics--zip code
level population density, median income, and high school
graduation rates,  = .14, t(192) = 2.12, p = .036. Percep-
tions of social class were also significantly positively
associated with actual speaker social class in three of the
four Census defined regions of the United States (all but
in the Midwest), region effect F(3, 1632) = 46.78, p <
.001).
We also examined how observer estimates of social
class performed relative to chance using the prior quar-
tile and half analysis. Splitting the sample for this analysis
appeared to be valid: For instance, the bottom half of
speakers had an average educational attainment of 1.83,
roughly equivalent to an education of high school gradu-
ation and some college, and an occupation code of
4209.54, similar to the occupation status of sales (4000)
and service workers (5000). The top half of the speaker
sample had an average educational attainment of 3.38,
consistent with obtaining a four-year college degree, and
an occupation score of 1477.33, similar to the occupation
status of professional athletes and journalists (1500). As
Figure 2 illustrates, observers showed above chance
accuracy in judging the correct quartile, x2(1) = 15.38,
p < .001, and half, x2(1) = 12.21, p < .001, of speaker
social class based only on their speaking style--evident
upon listening to just seven words spoken out of context.
Moreover, the overall chance accuracy estimate across
the modalities of social class signaling (see Fig. 2, right-
most bars) was significant, x2(1)Quartile
= 25.92, p < .001;
x2(1)Half
= 20.74, p < .001.
Overall, these studies across diverse domains of
speech and behavior provide some preliminary yet prom-
ising evidence suggesting that social class is rapidly and
accurately perceived in the early stages of social percep-
tion. Several future directions are suggested by this
research: For instance, does accuracy of social class per-
ception improve linearly with the addition of more
behavioral information about social class? Based on prior
research, it is possible that diminishing returns in social
perception accuracy occur for social class due to the
onset of confirmation biases (Nickerson, 1998). Likewise,
though we demonstrate that the information passed on in
the initial stages of impression formation is sufficient for
class signaling, data using more sensitive time measure-
ments might be able to determine precisely when accu-
racy in class signaling emerges in the social perception
process (e.g., at the level of seconds or milliseconds). It
is also interesting to speculate about the other modalities
of social perception where class signals are communi-
cated. Given health disparities between high and low
social class individuals (Adler etal., 1994), perhaps phys-
ical features that reveal health are also a reliable indicator
Signs of Social Class 427
of social class as preliminary work suggests (Bjornsdottir
& Rule, 2016).
Social class signals are also the result of two processes--
perceiver judgments and target behaviors--and thus far
studies have only started to examine the specific contribu-
tion of each process to accurate class signaling. Experi-
ments that systematically constrain target behavior, by for
instance, carefully controlling the context and conditions
for speech (Labov, 1972), can better tease apart both the
specific behaviors that elicit class signals and the minimal
conditions necessary for perceivers to judge social class. In
this vein, signal detection theory methods are needed to
determine how sensitive social class perceptions are to
variations in class signals (McNicol, 2005; Swets, 2014).
Lastly, one of the central claims of this analysis is that peo-
ple experience economic inequality principally through
this process of sending and perceiving social class signals
in daily interactions and comparatively less in terms of
macroeconomic societal shifts in wealth and markets. One
implication of this logic is that in countries or cultures
where societal economic inequality is lower, signals of
social class might actually be harder to discern than in
countries like the United States where inequality is height-
ened (e.g., Côté, House, & Willer, 2015).
Social Class Signals Augment
Group Boundaries
Having detailed evidence suggesting that social class is
perceived early on in the social perception process, we
now turn to the potential consequences of the accuracy
of social class perceptions for groups in society. We make
three specific predictions for how class signals augment
group boundaries--by facilitating the sorting of individu-
als into social class groups, activating social class stereo-
types, and enhancing conflict between the haves and
have nots in society.
Signals of social class create group boundaries by sort-
ing individuals into social class categories. The sorting of
people in society based on social class is readily appar-
ent from a cursory examination of social life. Schools and
neighborhoods are often segregated in terms of social
class, with many explicit home lending policies favoring
neighborhood separation based on social classes (Desmond,
2016). People's romantic preferences also seem to follow
along social class lines, as the educational attainment,
annual income, and occupational prestige of romantic
partners tends to be highly positively correlated (Schwartz,
2013). Social class sorting is also supported by low levels
of economic mobility in places like the United States,
where the chances of moving up or down in the social
class hierarchy are constrained, particularly relative to
people's lay estimates (Davidai & Gilovich, 2015; Kraus &
Tan, 2015). This sorting is one of the likely reasons why
people from differing social class backgrounds develop
unique norms and cultural models for behavior and
self-expression discussed earlier (Stephens, Markus, &
Fryberg, 2012; Weininger & Lareau, 2009).
In addition to the historical structural barriers that con-
tribute to the sorting of social class in society (Desmond,
2016), we contend that social class signals expressed and
perceived in interactions with others facilitate this sorting
process. Specifically, we assert that social class signals are
causal in the maintenance of structural social class
boundaries because they reduce class mobility and limit
cross-class contact. Several lines of evidence are sugges-
tive of this prediction: The notion that similarity enhances
liking and relationship formation is a core principle in
relationship science (Bergeron & Zanna, 1973; Montoya,
Horton, & Kirchner, 2008). When individuals accurately
signal and perceive social class in interactions with oth-
ers, signals that communicate differences in social class
are likely to create barriers for relationship formation
across class boundaries. In this fashion, class signals are
particularly strong in determining the likelihood of rela-
tionship formation and in constraining access to net-
works of influence and opportunity and to individuals of
similar (higher) social class upbringing.
The first work directly assessing this prediction was
conducted by Bergeron and Zanna (1973). In their study,
Peruvian university students read opinion pieces that
were manipulated to be written by someone who shared
their social class (i.e., attended their same university, an
elite social club, or a neighboring university) or who did
not (i.e., a member of the Peruvian indigenous popula-
tion not attending college). Participants reported desiring
to form a relationship with opinion writers who shared
their social class far more than they did the relatively
lower class indigenous writers not attending college, and
this effect was independent of participants' level of agree-
ment with the arguments in the opinion piece (Bergeron
& Zanna, 1973). In more recent experimental evidence,
describing a potential interaction partner using upper
class signals (e.g., plans to travel to Europe during the
summer) led to greater affiliation motivation among
upper class participants, whereas describing a partner
using lower class signals (e.g., plans to get a job over the
summer to help with family bills) led to greater affiliation
motivation among lower class participants (Côté, Kraus,
Piff, Beerman, & Keltner, 2014). Aligning with this
research, several correlational studies find that first gen-
eration college students report feeling more alienated
from university environments than do their continuing
generation counterparts--a finding that suggests that sig-
nals of social class on college campuses, which are pre-
dominantly populated by people from highly educated
families, reduce feelings of belonging among relatively
lower class individuals (e.g., Bufton, 2003; Ostrove &
428 Kraus et al.
Long, 2007; Reay, Crozier, & Clayton, 2009). Other work
on job hiring finds a similar pattern: Interviews reveal
that top-tier business firms rely on social class informa-
tion in extracurricular activities and club memberships to
seek out higher social class applicants (Rivera, 2016), and
experiments find that men described as working class
were less likely to receive a hypothetical job offer for a
higher class managerial position relative to middle-class
men (Rivera & Tilcsik, 2016).
Class signals also create group boundaries through
stereotyping--that is, social class signals activate unique
stereotypes about people from distinct ends of the eco-
nomic spectrum. Though the accuracy of stereotypes is a
matter of some controversy (McCauley, Jussim, & Lee,
1995), several converging lines of evidence suggest that
the use of stereotypes in person perception aid in the
formation of group boundaries and the expression of
prejudice and discrimination (Fiske, 2005; Fiske et
al.,
2002). Studies also indicate that signals of social class are
used as a basis for activating stereotypes. In the original
studies of the stereotype content model by Fiske and col-
leagues (2002), participants rated 23 groups in society
based on how others in society view the groups on
warmth and competence. The studies found that social
class was a reliable predictor of stereotype content across
studies and samples--the rich were viewed typically as
low in warmth but high in competence, whereas the
poor were viewed as both low in warmth and compe-
tence (Fiske etal., 2002). It is important to note that the
stereotype content association of high competence to
high social class has been replicated across 37 cultures
(Durante etal., 2013) and, in particular, when assessing
the stereotypes using social class signals: In one exam-
ple, signals of wealth in Italian print media were associ-
ated with ratings of individuals as higher in competence
(Durante, Volpato, & Fiske, 2010). In other research,
more or less expensive houses were used to judge the
competence of occupants (Oldmeadow & Fiske, 2012).
Just as class signals separate individuals from different
class backgrounds and activate stereotypes, they are also
the tinder for class conflict. Specifically, signals of social
class increase conflict between individuals of different
social class groups because they make salient that
resources are unequally shared between individuals in
society. Though people across countries and cultures
have different expectations for the ways in which
resources are shared, visible inequalities such as those
that are made apparent by social class signals violate
assumptions about the generosity of neighbors and the
fairness of current economic systems. For instance, prior
research indicates that residents of poor neighborhoods
are impacted psychologically by visible class signals--
experiencing worse health outcomes when they live
adjacent to rich neighborhoods than they do living
adjacent to poor neighborhoods (Pellowski, Kalichman,
Matthews, & Adler, 2013). To the extent health is related
to group conflict (e.g., Gallo & Matthews, 2003), this
research is suggestive of the possibility that social class
signals have the capacity to increase conflict between the
classes.
Several studies support the notion that the presence of
class signals contribute to rises in class conflict. On air-
planes, the odds of air rage, defined as extreme antiso-
cial behavior reported during commercial airline flights,
increase when class signals are visible--through the
presence versus absence of a first class cabin, or through
boarding the plane at the front of the aircraft where the
first class cabin is located versus boarding at the rear
where it is not (DeCelles & Norton, 2016). In laboratory
research, class signals were directly manipulated during a
competitive real estate negotiation, where two strangers
role-played as a buyer or seller of a biotechnology plant
(Kraus & Mendes, 2014). Prior to the negotiation, one of
the two participants was assigned to upper class clothing
(i.e., a business suit), lower class clothing (i.e., sweats
and t-shirt), or their own neutral clothing before engag-
ing in the negotiation with a neutrally clothed participant
unaware of the clothing change (Kraus & Mendes, 2014).
In the study, negotiation pairs where signals of social
class were manipulated experienced significant differ-
ences in profits, concessions, and physiological states
associated with threat vigilance between players whereas
no differences emerged in pairs where class signals were
not manipulated (Kraus & Mendes, 2014). In a more
direct experimental test of this conflict hypothesis, par-
ticipants were exposed to pictures of high or low wealth
before answering questions about their aggressive ten-
dencies. Participants exposed to high wealth signals in
pictures felt temporarily lower in social class and were
more likely to feel aggressive in general--particularly
toward a relatively upper-class PhD student who ostensi-
bly designed the wealth stimuli (Greitemeyer & Sagioglou,
2016). Though much of this research does not involve
specific interclass conflicts, the findings themselves are
suggestive of the role of signals of social class in provok-
ing aggressive states for individuals and potentially for
social groups around class lines.
Taken together, we have amassed some initial evi-
dence supporting our second prediction that class signals
create group boundaries between the haves and have
nots in society by sorting people into social classes, acti-
vating stereotype content, and enhancing class conflicts.
These early findings are supportive of our theoretical
predictions and suggest several avenues of future
research. For instance, in many of the reviewed experi-
ments, participants are exposed to class signals in con-
trolled laboratory settings (e.g., reading about a
hypothetical job candidate)--it will be instructive to
Signs of Social Class 429
determine whether perception of class signals during
more naturalistic social perception elicits the same group
processes. As well, some of the prior research indicates
that signals of higher social class are particularly strong
in eliciting conflict between social classes (DeCelles &
Norton, 2016; Kraus & Mendes, 2014). It will be interest-
ing in future research to examine if symbols of wealth and
poverty exert asymmetric influences on class boundaries.
People perceive others on a variety of group dimen-
sions, including social categories like race and gender
that have clear physical characteristics (e.g., skin color,
secondary sexual characteristics) that individuals use
during social perception. How social class group bound-
aries and stereotypes inform, and are informed by, per-
ceptions of other categories is an important area of future
research (e.g., Fiske & Dupree, 2014; Gilens, 1999). In
this regard, the potential permeability of social class
groups is a domain where social class may differ from
other categories: Aspirational motivations of relatively
lower class individuals might lead these individuals to
identify less with their social class group or even to stra-
tegically adjust their behavior to signal the social class to
which they aspire. More broadly, thinking of group
boundaries in terms of social class has the potential to
inform theories of intergroup relations by both adding a
social category upon which individuals define their social
groups and by highlighting the intersections of these cat-
egories. For instance, research on stereotype content sug-
gests that the valence of racial stereotypes depends on
social class (e.g., Fiske & Dupree, 2014).
Would people desiring upward mobility benefit from
modifying their own signals to appear as if they belong
to the class they aspire to--as is attempted by the char-
acter Eliza Doolittle in the play Pygmalion by George
Bernard Shaw (1913/2012)? Several studies are suggestive
of this possibility. For instance, the aforementioned
research on stereotyping suggests that shifting one's
social class signals to be more in line with higher social
class individuals will elicit others' judgments of height-
ened competence (e.g., Fiske etal., 2002). In the afore-
mentioned sartorial symbols manipulation study, people
who were assigned a business suit earned higher profits,
made fewer concessions, and were perceived as more
powerful in a dyadic negotiation relative to their interac-
tion partner, who was unaware of the clothing assign-
ment (Kraus & Mendes, 2014). These data suggest that
modifying one's class signals in aspirational ways has
immediate benefits; however, the sustainability of these
modifications is a matter of future empirical inquiry
(Fussell, 1992; Labov, 2006). For instance, several studies
indicate that awareness of one's lower status relative to
others is cognitively demanding (Johnson, Richeson, &
Finkel, 2011) or likely to elicit stereotype threat (Croizet
& Claire, 1998; Steele & Aronson, 1995), and these studies
suggest that conscious modification of class signals will
disrupt individual cognitive performance at least until the
behaviors become habitual.
Class Signals Perpetuate Economic
Inequality
The evidence we have reviewed thus far suggests that
class signals are accurately perceived in brief social behav-
ior and facilitate the creation of class boundaries. In this
final section, we detail the ways in which class signaling
processes have the potential to actually perpetuate the
economic conditions they arise from. We predict that class
signals increase economic inequality maintenance by elic-
iting dehumanizing judgments of those at the bottom of
the class hierarchy and strategic sharing patterns that
favor sharing resources with those who already have
resources over those without, as well as justifying ideolo-
gies that elicit perceptions of economic structures as fair,
legitimate, mobile, and merit-based.
Beliefs about people who occupy the lowest positions
on the social class hierarchy include that these individu-
als are both untrustworthy in social relationships and
incapable of changing their own states (Fiske et
al.,
2002). Thus, class signals that elicit judgments that one is
at the bottom of the economic hierarchy are likely to
elicit patterns of social perception suggesting that indi-
viduals are simultaneously incapable of achieving desired
life outcomes and more likely to harm others. This mix of
social judgments leads perceivers to scorn extremely low
status groups in society (Fiske, 2011) and to discount
their mental states and human characteristics (Cikara,
Bruneau, & Saxe, 2011)--a pattern we and others refer to
as dehumanization (Haslam, 2006).
In one illustrative study of this dehumanizing process
directed at the poor, Harris and Fiske (2006) showed
photographs of people from various groups in society.
Pictures of homeless and drug-addicted individuals, those
at the very bottom of the economic spectrum elicited
self-reports of disgust--an emotion associated with
intense dislike and avoidance of outgroups (Harris &
Fiske, 2006). In a study with similar methods, photo-
graphs of the poor were less likely to activate the medial
prefrontal cortex of perceivers, a brain region associated
with considering the mental states of others (Harris,
Cikara, & Fiske, 2008). Signals of lower social class appear
to reduce the extent that we consider the minds of the
poor.
Aligning with this dehumanization perspective, social
class signals are likely to elicit strategic patterns of
resource sharing. Part of the utility of signaling status in
interpersonal life is the capacity to weigh the costs and
benefits of cooperation (Ambady & Rosenthal, 1993;
Kraus & Keltner, 2009). In this vein, sharing resources
430 Kraus et al.
with a person with low economic standing may be per-
ceived as risky behavior because such a sharing relation-
ship has few direct economic benefits for the sharer.
Based on this analysis, one possible consequence is that
visible class signals perpetuate inequality in society by
discouraging resource sharing with those that have less
in favor of sharing with others of similar class standing.
Several lines of evidence support this assertion. In an
experiment directly testing whether visible class signals
influence strategic sharing, researchers created miniature
societies in an experimental economic game where par-
ticipants shared resources with each other across time
(Nishi, Shirado, Rand, & Christakis, 2015). In the study,
some societies were manipulated to have individuals
with visible resources whereas in other societies resources
were invisible. When resources were visible, participants
shared their resources with other resource-rich individu-
als, thereby perpetuating economic inequality. In con-
trast, when resources were invisible, participants shared
regardless of the resources of their partners, thereby
reducing economic inequality (Nishi etal., 2015). These
findings suggest that visible class signals perpetuate eco-
nomic inequality by eliciting strategic resource sharing
patterns. In other research, higher income individuals
gave less in a single trial dictator game to an anonymous
other when living in states that were more unequal or
when exposed to high levels of economic inequality
(Côté, House, & Willer, 2015). These results suggest that
awareness of social class differences elicits lower levels
of resource sharing among the wealthy.
Finally, we assert that signals of social class can also
activate basic dissonance processes that perpetuate eco-
nomic inequality. Cognitive dissonance occurs when
people are forced to reconcile conflicting attitudes or
behaviors (Festinger & Carlsmith, 1959; Kunda, 1990),
and economic inequality is an economic state that fre-
quently elicits dissonance processes (Kraus & Tan, 2015;
Shariff etal., 2016; c.f., Jost, Banaji, & Nosek, 2004; Jost,
Pelham, & Carvallo, 2002). In essence, when levels of
economic inequality widen, beliefs that society is fair and
just are directly challenged. These dissonance processes
associated with economic inequality, in part, explain why
people underestimate levels of economic inequality
(Norton & Ariely, 2011), class mobility (Davidai & Gilov-
ich, 2015), and CEO pay relative to the average worker
(Kiatpongsan & Norton, 2014).
Evidence we have reviewed thus far indicates that class
signals are perceived rapidly and accurately, activate class
stereotypes, and augment class boundaries. Many of these
psychological consequences of class signaling are likely
to elicit uncomfortable social comparisons about one's
standing in society relative to others (Buunk etal., 2003).
Through this process, we suggest that class signals are
also likely to elicit economic dissonance processes that
lead to the justification of economic inequality--particu-
larly for those at the top of the economic hierarchy who
stand to gain the most from the current economic system.
Though no study to date has examined the role of class
signals in particular in eliciting specific justifying ideolo-
gies, several studies indirectly illustrate this in laboratory
settings. In one set of studies, temporarily manipulating
an individual's relative standing to be higher than other
people in an economic game led to seeing the economic
game itself as fairer (Brown-Iannuzi, Lundberg, Kay, &
Payne, 2015). In another study, asking participants to
think of someone way below them on a social class lad-
der in society elicited beliefs that social class mobility was
higher in society than it actually was (Kraus & Tan, 2015).
To the extent that class signals activate these same com-
parison processes, we expect these signals to elicit similar
judgments of unequal economic systems as more fair,
mobile, merit-based, and justified.
The above evidence suggests that class signals activate
individual and group processes that perpetuate economic
inequality. Several lines of future research are necessary
to more rigorously test this theoretical prediction. For
instance, much of this work relies on laboratory studies
in which class signals are artificially made visible (Nishi
et al., 2015) or brought to mind (Brown-Iannuzi etal.,
2015). How actual class signals activate these same pro-
cesses as they are expressed in everyday social interac-
tions remains a promising area of future research. For
instance, the concealment of visible social class is a rea-
son used to justify school uniform policies in more than
20% of schools in the United States (Ball, Bowe, &
Gewirtz, 1996). Do uniforms reduce social class signaling
and class conflict, or alternatively, do the myriad and
subtle ways in which behaviors signal social class render
such uniform policies ineffective in concealing social
class?
Also, little is known about the mechanisms that might
counteract the ways that class signaling perpetuates eco-
nomic inequality. It is possible, for instance, that elevat-
ing compassionate responses to the needy, such as by
eliciting judgments of high self­other similarity with
lower class others (Oveis, Horberg, & Keltner, 2009), will
countervail the psychological processes related to eco-
nomic inequality maintenance. However, the evidence
we have reviewed thus far suggests that barriers to the
experience of compassion across social classes are sig-
nificant: People of higher social class standing view lower
social class others as outgroup members who are less
human, less warm, and less competent than their same
class counterparts and each of these perceptions is likely
to create a compassion barrier. Given these patterns, pol-
icies that aim to improve the lives of the poor by relying
on wealthy individuals and corporations to act compas-
sionately, with the best interests of lower class individuals
Signs of Social Class 431
in mind, do not rest on the available empirical evidence
(e.g., Bresnahan & Rogers, 2016).
Class Signals as Everyday Inequality
In this review, we argue that the global rising tide of eco-
nomic inequality is experienced at the interpersonal
level. We contend that subtle differences in the ways in
which people behave toward and even speak about the
haves and have nots of society are perceived rapidly and
accurately and that, as a consequence of these percep-
tions, social class divides sectors of society and economic
inequality is perpetuated. We support this theoretical
position with basic research studies from the psychologi-
cal and economic sciences that examine class signaling in
the context of observational studies of visible economic
inequality (DeCelles & Norton, 2016), as well as con-
trolled laboratory experiments (Nishi et al., 2015).
If our theoretical predictions are accurate, how might
social class signals shape society? One prediction derives
from the daily experience of relatively lower class indi-
viduals who, according to our theory, will see themselves
as chronically lower in societal status relative to others
across the domains of their lives. A consequence of these
chronic perceptions might be widespread disengagement
from politics as lower class individuals come to distrust a
political system that ignores their own daily economic
struggles. We see some evidence for these political trends
currently in the United States where lower class individu-
als participate less in general elections than their rela-
tively upper class counterparts (Census.gov; Laurison,
2016; McElwee, 2016) and where both members of Con-
gress and current Presidential candidates have the high-
est disapproval ratings on record (Enten, 2016). To the
extent that social class signals contribute to these trends
in politics is an empirical question worthy of further
research.
For relatively lower class Whites, daily perceptions of
subordinate societal status are also likely to sow inter-
group conflict, particularly with respect to other tradi-
tionally disadvantaged groups (cf., Gilens, 1999): When
new immigrants, refugees, women, or ethnic minorities
receive (or are simply perceived to receive) benefits from
the government that are not explicitly shared by lower
class Whites, these benefits have the potential to create
realistic group conflict (e.g., Bobo, 1983) because gov-
ernment policies seem to respond to one kind of injus-
tice (e.g., racial discrimination) and not another (e.g.,
conditions of poverty). One example of this dynamic is
the belief among Whites that Blacks are the sole and ille-
gitimate beneficiaries of welfare (Gilens, 1999). Wide-
spread concern about taking on Syrian refugees across
the United States and Europe and the existence of a cur-
rent U.S. President who has openly expressed racism and
white supremacy (Kharakh & Primack, 2016) are also
both potential examples of realistic conflict playing out in
current events. To the extent that these broad societal
trends are influenced by everyday signals of social class
is an empirical question worth scrutiny.
The reviewed evidence suggests a few additional
future empirical directions of note. In particular, there are
several implications for the process of class mobility
highlighted by our theory: The evidence for class signal-
ing suggests that one possible barrier to upward social
class mobility is that social class is perceived rapidly and
accurately in basic person perception and that these
judgments may elicit assessments of one's lower compe-
tence that could impact promotion and hiring decisions
(Rivera & Tilcsik, 2016) or feelings of belonging at a uni-
versity that are so crucial for academic achievement and
striving (Stephens, Hamedani, & Destin, 2014). As such,
perhaps individual differences in code switching apti-
tude, the ability to switch between group contexts and to
blend in with others (Labov, 2006; Steele, 2011), predict
an individual's capacity to move up the class hierarchy.
How societal institutions--like schools and employers--
can reduce the impact of class signaling, or alternatively,
weigh those signals in admission and hiring decisions is
also a crucial area of future inquiry.
Related to this point, the theoretical model we advo-
cate for here relates to past research examining the psy-
chological experience of individuals at the bottom of the
class hierarchy. This research indicates that lower social
class individuals are more vigilant of threats in their envi-
ronments (Gallo & Matthews, 2003), exhibit reduced
executive functioning (Mullainathan & Shafir, 2013), and
experience poorer health and well-being outcomes rela-
tive to their more advantaged counterparts (Adler etal.,
1994; for a review, see Kraus etal., 2012). Future research
could uncover the extent that class signals are causal in
eliciting these patterns, and some research is suggestive
of this possibility: As we mentioned previously, environ-
ments where inequality is more visible elicit greater
threat-related aggressive tendencies (DeCelles & Norton,
2016; Greitemeyer & Sagioglou, 2016) and more negative
health outcomes for the poor (Pellowski etal., 2013).
Overall then, the impact of economic inequality is both
significant and widespread. Significant because it predicts
the health and well-being of members of society, and
widespread because of the ways in which people can
experience inequality in the briefest of social interactions
with strangers, while boarding airplanes, and in travel
between schools and neighborhoods. Although societal
economic inequality has received growing empirical and
public attention, the everyday experience of that inequal-
ity is a largely unexamined phenomenon in need of
greater scrutiny: Macro-economic policy changes may not
receive widespread public support, regardless of their
432 Kraus et al.
benefits, if those policies do not also articulate the ways
in which they contend with social class dynamics in daily
social interactions. To wit, passage of the UK referendum
to leave the European Union occurred with the support of
relatively lower class individuals whose concerns cen-
tered more on the importance of allocating resources to
national programs, and less on the impact that leaving
might have on the economic fortunes of banks and multi-
national corporations (Barr, 2016). How nations, cultures,
and societies respond to economic inequality is a conten-
tious and complex issue with significant social and eco-
nomic implications for societies and, as we have argued,
the daily social and psychological experiences of indi-
viduals who populate them.
