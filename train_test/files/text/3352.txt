Special Issue - Ethnogerontology
As a result of recent economic, demographic, and social
trends in the United States, there has been growing interest in
individuals' attitudes, behaviors, and plans surrounding
retirement. Diversity among the older adult population is
expected to increase significantly; however, there is little
knowledge about minorities' interests and expectations for
retirement--especially among Hispanic, African Caribbean,
and immigrant populations. Such knowledge is important,
given that minorities have historically had different labor
market experiences, family patterns, living arrangements
(Lee, 2009), and health disparities (Hayward, Miles,
Crimmins, & Yang, 2000), compared with non-Hispanic
Whites. To increase our understandings of expectations and
plans for retirement among adults reaching retirement age,
this community-based participatory study involved focus
groups with a diverse sample of adults living in Miami-Dade
County, Florida.
Social and Economic Trends
Surrounding Retirement
Much of the current interest in retirement trends has sur-
rounded the experiences of Baby Boomers, a large cohort of
Americans born between the years 1946 and 1964, reaching
more than 77 million in 2011 (Colby & Ortman, 2014).
Approximately, 10,000 Baby Boomers turn 65 every day
since January 1, 2011 (Robison, Shugrue, Fortinsky, &
Gruman, 2013). In addition to this cohort's size, there are a
number of social characteristics among Baby Boomers that
differ from previous cohorts of retiring adults: They are more
diverse, racially and ethnically (Colby & Ortman, 2014);
they also tend to be wealthier, are less likely to be married,
have fewer children (Robison et al., 2013); and they experi-
ence better physical health and have greater life expectancies
(Maples & Abney, 2006).
Compared with prior cohorts, the Baby Boomer generation
has a higher percentage of minorities (Colby & Ortman, 2014)
and many are also foreign-born (Gassoumis, Wilber, Baker, &
Torres-Gil, 2009; Villa, Wallace, Bagdasaryan, & Aranda,
2012). However, it is important to note that foreign-born adults

"Work Is Like a Therapy That Prevents
Aging": Perceptions of Retirement,
Productivity, and Health Among
Minorities and Immigrants

Abstract
Diversity among the older adult population is expected to increase significantly. In addition, economic, demographic, and
social trends in the United States have led to growing interest in understanding attitudes, behaviors, and plans regarding
retirement among middle-aged and older adults. However, there is currently little knowledge about minorities' interests
and expectations for retirement. This community-based participatory study addressed gaps in knowledge by asking a diverse
sample of adults about their experiences and expectations for retirement. Data collection involved focus groups with
Hispanics, Haitians, African Americans, and immigrants living in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The findings indicate that
productive activity in later life was desired by participants across racial and ethnic groups, though higher income participants
reported having greater opportunities for pursuing desired productive activities later in life. Implications for policy and
services are discussed.

who were born between 1946 and 1964 may not have shared
the same experiences that make the American-born Baby
Boomers socially distinctive from other generations, such as
the Civil Rights Movement, Vietnam War, and historical dis-
trust of their parents' generation (Pruchno, 2012). Economic,
social, and health differences across various racial and ethnic
groups may also translate to special needs for certain subpopu-
lations of Baby Boomers as they transition to and live indepen-
dently during their retirement years. For instance, Gassoumis
and colleagues (2009) reported that more than a third (37%) of
Latino Baby Boomers living within the United States are non-
citizens, and Latino Baby Boomers are less likely than their
non-Latino counterparts to be English-proficient or to have
attended college and are more likely to experience a disability
or poverty. Lee (2009) reported that older minority women are
less likely to have financial security than non-Hispanic White
women during their retirement years. Helman, Greenwald,
VanDerhei, and Copeland (2007) reported that even though
AfricanAmerican and Hispanic workers are less likely than the
American workforce overall to be financially prepared for
retirement, they are just as likely to feel confident that they will
live comfortably during their retirement years.
Economic Trends Surrounding
Retirement
In addition to sociodemographic trends, recent economic
trends in the United States have had an impact on retirement
trends. The recent U.S. recession (2007-2009) had a signifi-
cant impact on adults who were nearing retirement. During
this time, the collapse in the housing and stock markets
destroyed a significant amount of household wealth (Rosnick
& Baker, 2009). As a result, the percentage of households "at
risk" for having inadequate retirement income by age 65,
jumped from 44% in 2007 to 51% in 2009 (VanDerhei, 2011),
and many Americans reported being unable to retire at the tra-
ditional ages of 62 to 65 (Buttell, 2009). Research during this
time period demonstrated that many adults nearing retirement
reported concern about not having enough savings (Maples &
Abney, 2006). In addition, a large majority reported a lack of
confidence that they will have enough money to live comfort-
ably throughout their retirement years and expected to rely on
postretirement employment to supplement their retirement
income (Duska, 2013). Despite the challenges posed by the
recession, Helman, Greenwald, Copeland, and VanDerhei
(2015) reported that confidence among American workers
about their financial security for retirement has started to
bounce back following the recession.
Expectations and Plans Surrounding
Retirement
Recent studies on retirement have primarily involved statisti-
cal analyses of large data sets (e.g., U.S. Census data, Health
and Retirement Study data) to study actual economic and
social behaviors and characteristics of those who are nearing
or have entered retirement (Gassoumis et al., 2009; Lee,
2009; Lusardi & Mitchell, 2007). Fewer studies have been
conducted to understand the attitudes, expectations, and/or
concerns toward aging and retirement. The Metlife Mature
Market Institute (2012) reported that the three largest con-
cerns about transitioning into retirement are financial security
(18%), ability to stay productive (16%), and ability to provide
for their long-term care needs or the needs of their spouse
(13%). However, these studies did not highlight the specific
concerns and expectations among minority populations.
Outside of economic reasons, there has also been an
increased interest in remaining productive during retirement
years. For instance, those approaching retirement often con-
sider the role that volunteering may play in their life after
leaving their full-time employment (Seaman, 2012). Also,
maintaining paid employment in later life has become more
common and it has been established that an increasing num-
ber of older African Americans and Hispanics will be in the
paid labor force (AARP, 2009, 2011). Productive aging is a
relatively newer concept and refers to the contributions that
older adults can and do make to the larger society through
activities that may include volunteerism, paid labor, or other
unpaid activities including civic engagement (Achenbaum,
2009). However, there is currently a dearth of knowledge
about minorities' perceptions of productive aging. In their
study on older Latinos, Hilton, Gonzalez, Saleh, Maitoza,
and Anngela-Cole (2012) reported that financial well-being
in later life and having security through employment, such as
income and health benefits, were part of participants'descrip-
tions of "successful aging," though "successful aging" and
"productive aging" are typically considered to be different
concepts (Achenbaum, 2009).
Productivity and Successful Aging:
Theoretical Framework
According to Rowe and Kahn (1987, 1997), successful aging
is influenced by three components: low risk of disease and
disability, high cognitive and physical functioning, and being
actively engaged with life. The last of these components
relates very closely with retirement activities, because it
includes productive activities. Rowe and Kahn (1997) recog-
nized that such productive activities can involve a myriad of
things that create value to the larger society and can be reim-
bursed (paid) or nonreimbursed (voluntary, unpaid).
Productive activities can also involve formal activities, such
as maintaining paid employment in the labor force or volun-
teering at a hospital, or informal activities, such as providing
emotional or direct support to someone in the community
who is ill. Drawing upon prior study findings, they also iden-
tified three predictors of productive aging: functional capac-
ity, where adults with high cognitive and physical capacity
Ruggiano et al. 3
are more likely to be productive in later life; educational
level, where those with higher levels of education demon-
strate more sustained productive activities; and self-efficacy,
where those who are more confident in their abilities in later
life engage in more productive activities.
Context of Current Study and Aims
This study took place in Miami-Dade County, Florida, where
about a half-million Baby Boomers reside (U.S. Census
Bureau, 2015). This was a community-based participatory
research (CBPR) study, where "community-based organiza-
tions play a direct role in the design and conduct of the
research study" (Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality, 2003, para. 3). The study was initiated by the United
Way of Miami-Dade County (herein after referred to as
United Way), which established an Older Adults Initiative
Steering Committee, comprised of academics, professionals,
and community members. The purpose of the Steering
Committee was to help develop a policy and service agenda
for older adults in Miami-Dade County. The United Way was
specifically interested in addressing the future needs of older
residents, and therefore decided to focus their attention on
the needs and concerns of local adults who were approaching
and/or transitioning into retirement age.
The Steering Committee became concerned about the
extent to which existing research could be used to adequately
engage in policy and service planning, given that Hispanics,
African Caribbeans, and immigrants were underrepresented
or excluded in retirement research. Miami-Dade County is
comprised of almost 2.7 million people, where 15.1% of the
population is 65 years old and older, 18.9% of residents iden-
tify as Black orAfricanAmerican, 66.2% identify as Hispanic
or Latino, and more than half are foreign-born (U.S. Census
Bureau, 2015). The local older adult population reflects this
diversity. According to the Florida Department of Elder
Affairs (DOEA; 2015), more than one in five residents of
Miami-Dade County is age 60 or older, with 18.1% of adults
in this age group identifying as Black or African American
and 67.5% identifying as Hispanic. The DOEA further
reports that more than 40% of older adults have limited
English proficiency, almost 30% are medically underserved,
and more than a third are Medicaid eligible.
Given the lack of representation of local populations in
retirement research, the Steering Committee ultimately
decided to partner with local researchers to conduct a study
on local adults who are transitioning into retirement. The
study examined the attitudes, expectations, and concerns
toward retirement among local adults between the ages of
1946 and 1958 (which the community partner identified as
"older" Baby Boomers) and set out to address the following
research questions.
Research Question 1 (RQ1): What are the experiences
of adults in Miami-Dade County (including those who are
Hispanic, Haitian, and foreign-born) as they transition
into retirement?
Research Question 2 (RQ2): What are the concerns of
this population as they make this transition?
Study Method
As a CBPR study, the United Way played a significant role in
the design and implementation of the research. First, United
Way partners drafted research questions that the lead
researcher and author helped revise. Then, they expressed
that they wanted to explore the research questions through
focus groups, so they regularly met with the researcher to
collectively plan the sample, and focus group guide and
plans for implementation of these focus groups until a
research design strategy was agreed upon. After the
researcher obtained an institutional review board approval
from Florida International University, the members of the
United Way obtained certificates in training for research with
human subjects as well as training from the researcher on
data collection, and the community partners began recruiting
participants with the support of their partnering agencies. All
English and Spanish-language data were collected, trans-
lated (for Spanish), and analyzed by the researcher and/or
United Way partners. The United Way decided to contract
with a consulting firm for Kreyol-language focus group data.
The CBPR design of the study made it possible to explore the
topic of retirement among populations who are difficult to
engage in research, including Spanish-speaking Hispanics,
Kreyol-speaking Haitians, and immigrants.
Recruiting Focus Group Participants
Participants were eligible for the study if they were born
between 1946 and 1958 (ages 55-68); spoke English,
Spanish, or Kreyol; and were living in Miami-Dade at the
time of the study. To reflect the diversity of the region,
emphasis was placed on recruiting participants who were of
Hispanic and Haitian ethnicities and focus groups were con-
ducted in English, Spanish, or Haitian Kreyol. All recruit-
ment, informed consent, and research materials were
translated into Spanish and Kreyol languages. To assure
quality in the translations, all Spanish-language materials
underwent initial translation (English to Spanish) followed
by translation back to English by a second translator, and
Kreyol translations were conducted by a local professional
consulting firm with expertise with Miami-Dade's Haitian
population.
To recruit focus group participants, local community agen-
cies distributed informational flyers about the study to their
clients. In addition, the project ran English, Spanish, and
Kreyol-language radio and newspaper advertisements in media
outlets that target local residents who speak the respective lan-
guage. Participants self-selected for the study by calling the
phone number provided by the flyer and/or advertisement.
4 SAGE Open
Upon calling, a project team member who speaks the language
of the potential participant explained the goals and methods of
the study, determined their eligibility for the study through a
series of screening questions, and scheduled the participant in a
focus group according to their interest and eligibility to
participate.
Data collection involved nine focus groups, which took
place at Partnering Community Organizations between
December 2013 and August 2014. Among the focus groups,
there were five groups conducted in English (two with higher
income earners, one with moderate-income earners, one with
moderate- and low-income earners, and one with low-income
earners); two groups conducted in Spanish (both with mod-
erate- and low-income earners); and two groups conducted in
Kreyol (one with low- and moderate-income earners and one
with high-income earners).1 It is important to note that many
of the participants were bilingual and selected a group based
on the language in which they felt most comfortable partici-
pating. Based on the community-partners'recommendations,
groups were also separated based on income level so that
higher income earners and low-income participants were in
separate groups. They indicated that this may increase the
comfort level among participants in sharing their experi-
ences with financial planning, retirement opportunities, and
other lifestyle decisions that may be affected by income.
Data Collection
After reading and signing a consent form to participate in the
study, participants were asked to complete a demographic
form, which was used to assess the overall characteristics of
the study sample. When all participants completed the con-
senting process and demographic forms, they participated in
a focus group that was facilitated by a member of the project
who was fluent in the preferred language of the participants
(English, Spanish, or Kreyol). The focus group sessions
lasted between 60 and 75 min and were guided by a focus
group protocol. At the end of each focus group, the partici-
pants were each offered a US$20 supermarket gift card as an
honorarium.
Participants' experiences and expectations for retirement
were explored through more general questions and prompts,
including "Looking ahead 5 to 10 years from now, what do
you hope to be doing with your life?" and "Tell me about
what you are currently doing or what you will be doing to
prepare for the next 5 to 10 years."
Analyzing the Focus Group Data
The audiotapes were transcribed, translated to English, and
checked for accuracy. The project team entered the demo-
graphic information about participants in an SPSS file to
generate frequencies for demographic characteristics. Using
an interpretivist approach informed by grounded theory
methods, the focus group data underwent a systematic
process of coding and theme development (Corbin & Strauss,
2008; Strauss, 1987) using Atlas.ti, a qualitative data analy-
sis software. First, two researchers (NR and JO) engaged in
open coding of the transcripts by independently reviewing
copies of the transcripts and unrestrictedly assigning words
and phrases to segments of text that represented particular
concepts. Using constant comparison, they engaged in an
ongoing process of comparing codes with previous data to
identify concepts that were similar and different across the
transcripts. These activities resulted in a list of codes that
changed during analysis as codes were added, altered, and
deleted as needed. Then, the researchers engaged in axial
coding, where codes were reviewed to determine their accu-
racy and creating larger, thematic categories from similar
and related codes. Later in the analysis, these categories were
used to create broader, thematic statements related to retire-
ment. To increase the trustworthiness of the findings, the
researchers assessed the data independently and held regular
meetings where they identified minor discrepancies in their
analyses. These discrepancies were resolved by discussing
the codes, categories, and themes until an agreement was
reached. Finally, the researchers presented the final catego-
ries and themes to the community partners, where minor dis-
crepancies were resolved through discussion.
Study Findings
Overall, the study included 50 participants,2 with the overall
sample reflecting the racial and ethnic diversity of Miami-Dade
County. Two larger themes with corresponding subthemes
emerged from the data. The first theme related to Redefining
Retirement, where many participants reported that retirement is
different for their generation than their parents' generation
because they are "different from their parents" both socially
and economically. They also expressed that they are redefining
retirement by expecting to work in the paid labor force after the
traditional retirement ages of 62 and 65. The second larger
theme related to their Expectations and Experiences for
Transitioning Into Retirement, which involved discussions of
continuing with planned work activities for higher income par-
ticipants and unexpected and often unsatisfying employment
statuses for lower income participants. Participants across
focus groups reported an interest in volunteering. More detail
on the sample and these thematic findings are described below.
Study Sample Characteristics
As indicated in Table 1, the focus group participants varied in
race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Out of the 50 par-
ticipants, 80% were women and the majority identified as
being Hispanic (40%) and/or Black/African American (44%).
Forty-four percent indicated that they were born outside of
the United States. The most common (44%) level of educa-
tion completed by participants was a 4-year college degree.
One in four had less than a high school education. At the time
Ruggiano et al. 5
of their focus group, almost two thirds (64%) of respondents
indicated that they were working in paid labor activities, six
(12%) indicated that they were retired, and another six (12%)
indicated that disability left them unable to work.
Redefining Retirement
We are different from our parents. The term retirement was
not defined for participants by members of the research team.
Although focus group participants did not inherently provide
definitions for "retirement," they acknowledged that their
experiences and expectations for retirement were different
than that of their parents' generation. Specifically, many
reported that they perceived their parents as being "older" at
retirement compared with the way Baby Boomers view
themselves today. For instance, Valerie, a higher income,
non-Hispanic White woman stated,
In my parents' generation, a 60-year old grandmother was
someone who wore a housedress and an apron, gray hair was
pulled back in a bun and she's been a homemaker her whole life
and her job was to make cookies for the grandchildren. We are
not that and we will never be that.
As a result, participants viewed themselves as having
more energy and ambition than their parents did when they
retired. They identified exiting the paid labor force as being
more appropriate for someone much older than themselves
and their vision of retirement involved the opportunity and
interest in engaging in an active lifestyle during later life. For
example, Elizabeth, a moderate-income, non-Hispanic White
woman explained,
I do think that at our age we're not so old, as maybe our parents
were much older at our age. I think we're more active, we do

more things, and we're interested in more diverse things. But if
I saw something interesting I might say "Gee, I'd like to try
that."
Participants also indicated that it was "easier" for their par-
ents' generation to retire, which is why more of their parents'
exited the paid workforce at traditional retirement ages than
those from their own generation. One reason provided for this
is that the recent recession made it more difficult for those who
are currently ready to retire. They also believed that there were
more policies, programs, and education available to their par-
ents' generation that helped them transition into retirement,
which is unlike their experience today. One example of this
came from Daniel, a low/moderate-income Haitian man:
I see that [retirement] was easier for [our parents] in the sense
that the economy wasn't as bad. It was easier for them to save.
When retiring, a lot of them had already finished paying their
mortgages. They built houses in Haiti. They have a pied-a-terre.
Work as long as you can. Although participants felt that it was
easier for their parents' generation to retire than their own,
most reported that they welcomed the opportunity to con-
tinue working during later life for as long as they were physi-
cally and mentally healthy enough to engage in productive
activities. There was a general sentiment across focus groups
that spending retirement years engaged in mostly leisurely
activities would be unsatisfying. For some, this meant pro-
longing retirement or not retiring at all; many participants
advised that their peers and future generations should con-
tinue working in paid employment as long as it was possible.
For instance, Beatrice, a low/moderate-income Haitian
woman stated, "As long as I'm healthy, I would like to work
as long/late as I can." Similarly, Louise, a low-income Afri-
can American woman explained, "That's why I would tell
anybody that's working, young, older people, work long as
you can." It is important to note that in response to Louise's
statement, all the other focus group participants nodded and
verbally reported their agreement.
Within the two Haitian focus groups, there was specific
discussion regarding how working later in life is very impor-
tant for maintaining good mental health as people age. One
example of this can be seen through Gregory, a low/moder-
ate-income Haitian man:
I don't see myself retiring anytime soon. For me, work is like a
therapy that prevents aging. For example, some people start
their retirement, they got depressed and they fall on, they let go.
However, a few examples in my environment that some people
that are 75 years old and they continue working as head of their
organizations. They functioned like they were in their 50s. The
stress is less on them because they are working.
This focus on mental health was not discussed in other focus
groups, where the discussion on declining health focused
mainly on physical health.
Although working later in life is what most participants
thought would be satisfying, there was an acknowledgment
by several participants that retirement should be individual-
ized to meet individuals' needs and that there may be some
people who would like to exit the paid labor force at more
traditional retirement ages. Essentially, there was lack of
consensus on what an "ideal" age for exiting the paid labor
force should be. Maria, a higher income Hispanic woman
explained, "I think a lot of people would [retire] for their
own needs, some people may continue to work because that's
what works for them and keeps them alive and keeps them
thriving. Other people may choose not to."
Expectations and Experiences for Transitioning
Into Retirement
Continuing to work how I want. Although the interest in working
during retirement years was reported by participants across
racial and ethnic groups in the study, the type of work experi-
ence they expect differed among income groups. Although
higher income earners did not report plans to leave the paid
labor force altogether, they often expressed intentions to change
the context under which they work. For example, some higher
income participants were interested in repurposing their skills
into new employment opportunities or interests. For instance,
Joan, a higher income non-Hispanic White woman stated, "I'm
feeling very restless. I'm ready to go onto the next thing. What
do they say? Reinvent, restart, repurpose. I'm anxious to do
that." Similarly, Robert, a higher income African American
man reported that he wanted to retire from his government posi-
tion earlier than what is traditional and transfer his skills to work
for an advocacy nonprofit organization. He explained,
I see myself as retiring earlier, meaning I'll be about 57 [or] 58,
because I want to do some other stuff. I want to have maybe a
little bit more fun now . . . I can still be productive in my 50s.
In other cases, higher income earning participants desired
to continue working in their current position during later life,
but defined "retirement" as working fewer hours per day or
fewer days per week. As Maria, a higher income Hispanic
woman stated, "I'm going to be doing what I'm doing right
now. Except instead of working 13-14 hours a day, I might
just work 8 . . . I'll take is slower, working 8 hours Monday
through Friday." There was also the case of Valerie, a higher
income non-Hispanic White woman, who wanted to both
change the focus and reduce the hours in which she worked:
I'm looking forward to two things: to redirect my activities to
some of my other interests and to change the pace. I work 10-12
hours routinely, and I have for years. So, to work 5-6 hours a day
would be nice.
Not the retirement I chose.Unlike higher income partici-
pants, low- and moderate-income participants in the study
Ruggiano et al. 7
reported that they experienced a number of barriers to pursu-
ing the activities they wanted to engage in during their retire-
ment years. For many participants (similar to those with
higher incomes), they wanted to continue with their paid
employment activities in later life, but work fewer hours or
days during the week. However, given financial constraints,
they were unable to do so and continued to work full-time,
despite their interests. For some, this was due to the recent
economic trends, such as Estelle, a moderate-income non-
Hispanic White woman:
I worked all my life . . . When my husband [was affected by the
bad economy] and everything go delete . . . I tried to help him so
I worked three more jobs to just pay loan whatever we have and
I got sick and get in the hospital so they find something in my
spine I can't stay on my feet long time. So, my retirement is not
like I choose. Because if they give me disability I cannot stay
home doing nothing . . . I get depressed.
For those who worked more than they desired for financial rea-
sons, some never left their full-time jobs out of concern that
they did not have enough money to retire. Others reported that
they previously retired and left their full-time positions, but for
financial reasons they decided to return to paid employment on
a part-time or full-time basis to supplement other retirement
income sources. Jean, a low/moderate-income Haitian man,
felt that this was a common experience in his community:
In ten to fifteen years, will the money I am making now permit
me to retire? I look at people around me, the generation before
me, they almost cannot retire. They all do a part-time job even
when they turn 68 or 69 years old. This is something that makes
me think a lot. When I go to a supermarket, I see people who
over 70 years old that are obligated to work because the social
security income is not enough for their everyday lives. They
utilized their 401K seven years ago and they must work for a
minimum wage of another ten years yet.
On the other end of the spectrum, there were participants
who reported that they wanted to continue working in paid labor
activities, but were forced to exit the workforce due to the onset
of a chronic condition, either their own or that of a family mem-
ber. Rather than making future plans for retirement, these par-
ticipants reported that declining health and/or the recent
downturn in the economy had already affected their decisions
about retirement. In the case of John, a moderate-income non-
Hispanic White man, the onset of a chronic condition caused
him to lose his career and he lamented about filling up his retire-
ment years with part-time work that he found unfulfilling:
I work part-time. I'm a hair stylist. My situation has changed.
When I got sick a lot of my customers ran, you know . . . I
worked in a nursing home. In the past five years when things
slowed up I worked at the theaters. I worked at the Miami arena
doing usher work. I took low-paying jobs, many of them. I
worked as a school crossing guard. This was all to supplement
my income.
In such cases, women were more likely to report that they
left the paid labor force to provide care for a loved one, such
as Helen, a low-income African American woman:
I didn't choose to retire, I had to. My husband was sick . . . He
got sick and had to have a leg amputated. I had to stop [working]
because [husband's name] was 61 when he had to retire. His
insurance wouldn't do anything for him, because that's how it
was. So I had to stop. He couldn't get a nurse or nothing so I had
to stop working to take care of him . . . Then by the time he died
. . . my health went bad, so I couldn't do anything.
Marisol, a moderate-income Hispanic woman reported a
similar experience:
I thought I would retire at 62 but unfortunately my husband got
sick and I spent time caring for him and then he died and then I
was 62 when he passed and I wanted to retire but had no advice.
Maybe if it had not happened I would have continued to work, I
am a very active person but I worried about not being able to
have enough income to have a comfortable retirement. I cannot
complain, I have retirement money and I have my insurance that
I think this is most important because anything can happen to us
at this age and I have happiness, thank God. (Marisol, moderate
income earner, Hispanic)
In the cases of individuals who felt that they were under-
employed or were interested in securing paid employment,
low- and moderate-income participants felt that there were
limited opportunities for work. As Leila, a low/moderate-
income Haitian woman summed, "Everyone here is looking
for work." Unlike the higher income participants, who felt as
if their many years of experience and good health would pro-
vide many opportunities for fulfilling paid employment later
in life, low- and moderate-income participants reported that
their age and health statuses were barriers. Sandra, a low/
moderate-income Haitian women reported a common senti-
ment that older people may be overlooked by employers,
who would want younger workers with better health:
Well, at that age, you won't be able to do the same kind of jobs.
Sometimes you may want to do the job, but a younger person
comes and they give it to him. They always prefer the young.
Because, for example myself, at my age, I'm not in the best of
health, my eyes aren't working the way they should. Even if you
go job-hunting, the odds aren't in your favor. It's hard.
Helen, a low-income African American woman shared this
frustration: "They're not accepting older people. They want
younger people so they can advance with the job and stuff.
They don't want no older people."
Productivity Through Volunteerism
In addition to maintaining productivity through paid work
activities, participants across focus groups expressed interest
in remaining productive through volunteer opportunities.
8 SAGE Open
Most participants who reported an interest in volunteering
believed that their church would provide opportunities for
remaining productive, such as Lourdes, a low-income
Hispanic woman, who said,
I would like to volunteer for something, a home, something to
help people like my same age, or a church, collaborate with
something. I am very active and come from a very active family.
I do not like sitting around.
Similarly, Anabelle, a low/moderate-income Haitian woman
stated, "Personally, I'd like to concentrate on church activi-
ties. After retiring, I'd like to give the church all my time."
Many reported that volunteer opportunities were attractive
because they would allow the participant to explore interests
that they had been putting off during their busy years of full-
time employment. For instance, Maria, a higher income
Hispanic women, developed a personal interest in helping
others that she would have time to pursue during retirement:
"One of my interests, not all of them, obviously I'm interested
in ALS [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis] which I learned deal-
ing with my mom and all the short comings of being the care-
taker for an elderly parent." Stephanie, a higher income
African American woman, reported that volunteerism was
one way of attaining the items on her "bucket list":
My concept of retirement is that at some point I'll leave paid
employment, but I'll be able to do whatever I want to do on my
terms on my schedule. Maybe it is go to school, maybe it is to
volunteer. I guess I have my little semi-bucket list of things I
want to do, travel. I've got those kinds of things on my plate so
5-10 years from now, I hope that I will have crossed off a few
things on my bucket list that I'll still be in possession of my
faculties and I can continue to go down that bucket list.
Discussion
Historically, the term retirement referred to the active with-
drawal from the paid labor force. Previous research on adults
who are nearing or entering retirement suggest that this con-
cept of retirement has changed over time and that retirement
is now a general stage of later life where productive activi-
ties, including paid employment and volunteerism, do not
cease, but continue. Sometimes, they continue with a new
context or to a lesser extent. However, most of the research
about expectations and experiences surrounding retirement
has focused on non-Hispanic Whites. The current study adds
to the literature by reporting the expectations and experi-
ences of a diverse sample of adults nearing or entering retire-
ment, mostly Hispanic, Haitian, African American, and
immigrant adults. The findings from this study align with
prior research, in that adults from a variety of racial and eth-
nic minority groups reported interests in remaining produc-
tive later in life and viewed retirement as involving paid and/
or unpaid productive activities. However, the findings should
be interpreted with caution, as the study was conducted in
Miami-Dade County and may not be as relevant for other
minority or immigrant communities.
The main implication of this study is that the concept of
productive aging is important to adults from a variety of
racial and ethnic groups. However, the study findings also
demonstrate that adults with lower socioeconomic statuses
and compromised health, which disproportionately affects
older minorities (Gassoumis et al., 2009; Hayward et al.,
2000; Lee, 2009), may place constraints on productive aging.
This suggests that policies and services should support activ-
ities that increase older adults' capacity to create goods and
provide services, such as paid employment or unpaid volun-
teerism (Wheeler & Giunta, 2009).
An Agenda for Promoting Productive Aging for
Minorities
Although older adults across racial/ethnic groups, income
levels, and immigration statuses reported that they valued the
continuation of employment activities and volunteerism later
in life, existing research also demonstrates that they experi-
ence a number of benefits when they continue to work or
volunteer. Hinterlong, Morrow-Howell, and Rozario (2007)
found that productive activity later in life is associated with
better self-rated health and less functional impairment among
White and African American older adults. Volunteering in
later life is also associated with positive health outcomes for
older minorities (Fried et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2009).
Despite the potential benefits of productive aging for
society, institutions are not prepared to support and accom-
modate an aging workforce (van Dalen, Henkens, & Wang,
2015). Hinterlong and colleagues (2007) have suggested a
"reinvention" of employment through public and private
policies that offer older adults the option of pursuing produc-
tive activities that help them stay fully employed or transi-
tion into retirement (p. 155). Such changes may include
employers offering prorated fringe benefits to part-time older
workers or creating incentives for late-life employment
through changes to Medicare, the Social Security Act, and
the Earned Income Tax Credit.
One way to support productive aging for older minorities
is through programs and policies that help them prepare for
and respond to disability and chronic illnesses. In this study,
most participants who had left the paid labor force reported
that they did so in response to the onset of a chronic condi-
tion--their own or their spouses'. This aligns with prior
research that has linked the experience of chronic conditions
or health decline in general with a reduction or ceasing of
labor force participation in later life (Jason, Carr,Washington,
Hilliard, & Mingo, 2015; Koolhaas, van der Klink, de Boer,
Groothoff, & Brouwer, 2013). This may have larger implica-
tions for minority populations, which are more likely to
develop a chronic condition than non-Hispanic Whites
(Dunlop, Song, Manheim, Daviglus, & Chang, 2007). In
addition, the link between socioeconomic status and the
Ruggiano et al. 9
onset of a chronic condition (Hayward et al., 2000) suggests
that those who are the most financially vulnerable are at the
greatest risk of prematurely (and involuntarily) exiting the
paid labor force. However, resilience among workers with
chronic conditions has been linked with longevity in paid
workforce activity (Jason et al., 2015). Therefore, public and
private initiatives that educate workers on how to self-man-
age chronic conditions may be beneficial in retaining older
workers, especially older minorities. For a variety of chronic
health conditions, health self-management programs have
been successful at educating minority populations about how
to self-manage health (Lorig, Ritter, & González, 2003).
Occupational therapists may be particularly helpful in assist-
ing older workers in adapting work activities and environ-
ments to better support and accommodate their chronic
conditions in the workplace and allow them to remain
employed (Hammond, 2004).
Another way to promote productive aging is to target
minority populations in programs that better prepare them
for new volunteer and paid labor activities later in life.
According to the successful aging model posed by Rowe and
Kahn (1997), self-efficacy is a predictor of engagement in
productive aging activities in later life. As a result, older
adults who have retired from their careers and are interested
in pursuing new paid labor or unpaid volunteer activities
may need education and training to make such opportunities
more accessible. In this study, higher income participants
reported confidence in translating their existing skills into
new employment and volunteer opportunities and had spe-
cific plans to pursue such interests. In addition, many low-
income participants who have already retired reported an
interest in pursuing paid labor activities but lacked confi-
dence in accessing work opportunities and therefore, stopped
pursuing employment. Hence, offering training that may
help them make easier transitions into productive activities
during retirement may increase productive aging--and
therefore successful aging, according to Rowe and Kahn
(1987, 1997)--for older adults across income and education
levels. For some older adults, this may involve training on
starting a new business, given current findings about interest
in entrepreneurship and consulting. Indeed, entrepreneurship
among older adults has grown significantly in recent years
and has been found to be a viable option for those who vol-
untarily leave their current position and those who were
involuntarily retired from the paid labor force (Isele &
Rogoff, 2014). However, such training may not be feasible
or of interest to many older adults. In addition to career train-
ing opportunities, efforts to link older adults with employ-
ment opportunities during retirement may be particularly
helpful in promoting their employment.
Finally, the current findings echo previous findings on
minorities' interests in volunteerism in later life and greater
effort should be dedicated to engaging them into formal vol-
unteer activities. Many participants viewed volunteerism as
something that they were interested in, in addition to paid
labor force opportunities, rather than in replacement of them.
This is positive, given findings that multiple productive
activities in later life are associated with greater health out-
comes, rather than working or volunteering alone (Hinterlong
et al., 2007). Unfortunately, nonprofit institutions are often
unprepared to recruit and retain older volunteers for mean-
ingful roles (Endres & Holmes, 2007). Developing institu-
tional support for older minorities to volunteer may include
administrative support (Narushima, 2005), flexibility in the
types of tasks or schedules for volunteerism (Tang, Morrow-
Howell, & Hong, 2009), and choice in volunteer activities
(Epstein & Boisvert, 2006); any of these may lead to success
in tapping into the resources, skills, and knowledge that older
volunteers have to offer. Also, participants' interest in volun-
teering for churches suggests that community-based strate-
gies for increasing volunteerism among older adults involve
mining faith-based opportunities for civic engagement.
Limitations and Future Research
This study contributes to the existing research on retirement
by presenting the perspectives of a diverse set of adults who
are nearing or entering retirement regarding their expecta-
tions and experiences with retirement. The CBPR design of
the study allowed the researchers to examine the perspec-
tives of populations that have not been heavily studied in
prior research on retirement expectations, including
Hispanics, Haitians, and immigrants. However, the sample
size and composition (mostly women) does not allow for
generalizing the findings. Also, the study was conducted in
Miami-Dade County, Florida, which is a minority-majority
metropolitan area with a large immigrant population and the
majority of local Hispanics are of Cuban descent. Therefore,
the experience of minorities in this study may be different
than those in other regions. Finally, the composition of the
sample was planned to reflect the diverse population of
Miami-Dade County and therefore included individuals from
a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds. Therefore, gener-
alizations about any individual racial or ethnic group that
was represented in this study cannot be made.
Nonetheless, this study initiates a dialogue on minorities'
expectations for productive aging and provides a starting
point for future work. Most notably, future studies should
further examine how minorities define and view productive
aging. Interventions that aim to support older minorities as
they remain in the paid labor force when they want to should
be developed and tested. Special attention should be given to
policies and programs that help older adults return to the paid
labor force for those who involuntarily retired or those who
have voluntarily retired, but have changed their minds. Given
that this study revealed, across racial and ethnic group, an
interest in productive aging, there may be merit in examining
how programs that demonstrate success with non-Hispanic
Whites may be redesigned to be culturally appropriate for
minority Baby Boomers and older adults.
10 SAGE Open
Conclusion
Baby Boomers are redefining retirement--abandoning the
concept of late life as a time for leisure and embracing
productivity in later life. Both the paid labor force and vol-
unteer industry may gain from this cultural shift by utiliz-
ing the human capital of older adults in meaningful ways,
especially in communities with racial and ethnic diversity.
However, policies and institutions do not appear prepared
to engage older adults in active roles that may be mutually
beneficial. More research, policies, and practices are
needed to adequately recruit and retain older adults for
employment and volunteer roles so they may continue
being productive and potentially healthier throughout their
life course.
