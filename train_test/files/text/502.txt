OBJECTIVE: To estimate the rates of pregnancy-associ-
ated homicide and suicide in a multistate sample from
the National Violent Death Reporting System, to com-
pare these rates with other causes of maternal mortality,
and to describe victims' demographic characteristics.
METHODS: We analyzed data from female victims of
reproductive age from 2003 to 2007. We identified preg-
nancy-associated violent deaths as deaths attributable to
homicide or suicide during pregnancy or within the first
year postpartum, and we calculated the rates of pregnancy-
associated homicide and suicide as the number of deaths
per 100,000 live births in the sample population. We used
descriptive statistics to report victims' demographic char-
acteristics and prevalence of intimate-partner violence.
RESULTS: There were 94 counts of pregnancy-associated
suicide and 139 counts of pregnancy-associated homi-
cide, yielding pregnancy-associated suicide and homicide
rates of 2.0 and 2.9 deaths per 100,000 live births,
respectively. Victims of pregnancy-associated suicide
were significantly more likely to be older and white or
Native American as compared with all live births in
National Violent Death Reporting System states. Preg-
nancy-associated homicide victims were significantly
more likely to be at the extremes of the age range and
African American. In our study, 54.3% of pregnancy-
associated suicides involved intimate partner conflict that
appeared to contribute to the suicide, and 45.3% of
pregnancy-associated homicides were associated with
intimate-partner violence.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that pregnancy-as-
sociated homicide and suicide are important contributors
to maternal mortality and confirm the need to evaluate
the relationships between sociodemographic disparities
and intimate-partner violence with pregnancy-associated
violent death.

preventable causes of maternal injury. However, the
study of homicide and suicide has been limited by: 1)
a lack of information concerning victim-to-suspect
relationships; 2) studies limited to localized samples;
3) little information regarding precipitating circum-
stances to these deaths; and 4) likely underreporting
of maternal violent deaths, especially because of
reliance on death certificates alone.10
We sought to address these gaps in the literature
by conducting a secondary data analysis of maternal
violent death from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention's (CDC) National Violent Death Re-
porting System, a multistate database that collects
data on violent deaths, including victim-to-suspect
relationships, using multiple complementary data
sources. This study aims to estimate the rates of
pregnancy-associated (occurring during pregnancy or
the first year postpartum) homicide and suicide in a
multistate sample; compare these rates with other
causes of mortality during the perinatal period; de-
scribe the demographic characteristics of victims of
pregnancy-associated violent death; and estimate the
prevalence of intimate partner conflict associated with
these maternal deaths.
As previous data have suggested a strong associ-
ation between intimate-partner violence and pregnancy-
associated homicide, a significant association between
intimate-partner violence and suicidal tendencies and
suicides in women,12­16 and a potential relationship
between intimate-partner violence and pregnancy-
associated suicide exist,17 we hypothesized that inti-
mate partner conflict may be related to pregnancy-
associated violent death. This relationship requires
the understanding of victim-to-suspect relationships
and precipitating circumstances, variables that are
available in the National Violent Death Reporting
System.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We conducted a secondary data analysis of the Na-
tional Violent Death Reporting System, a multistate
active surveillance system controlled by the CDC.
The National Violent Death Reporting System began
collecting violent death data in 2003. Participating
states collect risk factor data on all violent deaths,
including homicides, suicides, unintentional deaths
by firearms, legal intervention deaths, and deaths of
undetermined intent. Seven states participated in
2003 and 13 participated in 2004. In 2005, the
number of participating states increased to 17, includ-
ing South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, Vir-
ginia, New Jersey, Maryland, Alaska, Massachusetts,
Oregon, Colorado, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Wis-
consin, California, Kentucky, New Mexico, and Utah.
All states report statewide data except California,
which gathers information only in a limited number
of counties.18
The National Violent Death Reporting System is
incident-based (not victim-based), meaning that it
contains reports related to both victims and suspects
associated with a given incident within one incident
record. This links all victims and suspects with a given
incident, permitting researchers to determine if the
suspect was a partner of the victim. The system also
uses multiple complementary data sources, including
not only death certificates but also coroner or medical
examiner records and police reports and contains
approximately 250 unique data elements, including
data on victim characteristics and precipitating cir-
cumstances of death.18 Each state health department's
National Violent Death Reporting System office co-
ordinates the abstraction process, which may include
electronic transfer of data from primary sources or
manual abstraction from the records maintained by
primary sources at their offices.18 A coding manual is
provided, and coding training is performed annually
for all participating states.39 In addition, the CDC
provides ongoing coding support through conference
calls and an e-mail help desk.39 National Violent
Death Reporting System states use multiple abstrac-
tors to perform blinded reabstraction of cases for
reliability checks. The CDC also conducts a quality of
control analysis, with a particular focus on abstractor-
assigned variables. Further detail related to the Na-
tional Violent Death Reporting System coding proce-
dures is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/
profiles/nvdrs.
The National Violent Death Reporting System
collects information regarding pregnancy or postpar-
tum status at the time of death. Information regarding
pregnancy status is abstracted from the coroner or
medical examiner records and the death certificate.
The coding structure of the National Violent Death
Reporting System pregnancy status variable was de-
signed to match the U.S. standard death certificate,
which was modified in 2003 to include checkboxes to
differentiate whether a woman was pregnant, within
42 days postpartum, within 1 year postpartum, or not
pregnant within the past year at the time of death.10
By 2005, only five of the participating National Vio-
lent Death Reporting System states were using this
version of the U.S. standard death certificate.19 There-
fore, two additional responses are available on the
coding tree for states with death certificates that do
not include a timeline that matches the U.S. standard
death certificate: "not pregnant, not otherwise speci-
VOL. 118, NO. 5, NOVEMBER 2011 Palladino et al Pregnancy-Associated Homicide and Suicide 1057
fied" and "pregnant, not otherwise specified."18 For
the purposes of our analysis, we treated values "preg-
nant at the time of death" and "pregnant, not other-
wise specified" as pregnant at the time of death and
values "not pregnant but pregnant within 42 days of
death" and "not pregnant but pregnant 43 days to 1
year before death" as pregnant within 1 year of death.
The CDC/American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists Maternal Mortality Study Group
defined the term pregnancy-associated mortality to
include "any death of a woman while pregnant or
within 1 year of the termination of pregnancy, regard-
less of cause"; this includes deaths related and unre-
lated to pregnancy.4 In keeping with this terminology,
we used the terms pregnancy-associated homicide
and pregnancy-associated suicide to represent deaths
during pregnancy or within 1 year postpartum attrib-
utable to homicide and suicide, respectively. In addi-
tion, we used the terms pregnancy-associated homi-
cide rate and pregnancy-associated suicide rate to
refer to the number of pregnancy-associated homi-
cides and suicides per 100,000 live births, respec-
tively. We used the term pregnancy-associated violent
death to refer to deaths from homicide and suicide
combined. The term "pregnancy-associated" refers to
the timing of the death and does not mean that the
homicide or suicide was caused by pregnancy or
postpartum status.
The National Violent Death Reporting System
contains six variables related to intimate-partner vio-
lence: victim-to-suspect relationship; intimate partner
problem (suicides only); perpetrator of interpersonal
violence (suicides only); victim of interpersonal vio-
lence (suicides only); intimate-partner violence­re-
lated (homicides only); or jealousy ("lover's triangle, "
homicides only).18
The victim-to-suspect relationship is abstracted
based on the police report and the coroner or medical
examiner records. Abstractors report the relationship
as one of 29 relationship types or as unknown. For the
purpose of our study, we defined a relationship as an
intimate partner relationship if it was coded as any
one of the following five relationship categories:
Spouse; ex-spouse; girlfriend or boyfriend; ex-girl-
friend or ex-boyfriend; or girlfriend or boyfriend,
unspecified whether current or ex.18
For suicide victims, National Violent Death Re-
porting System abstractors record whether problems
with a current or former intimate partner appear to
have contributed to the suicide. The abstractors are
instructed to code this variable as "yes" if, after
reviewing the coroner or medical examiner records,
police report, and child fatality report, if applicable,
they found that at the time of the incident the victim
was experiencing problems with a current or former
intimate partner, such as a divorce, break-up, argu-
ment, jealousy, conflict, or discord. In the case of
suicides, abstractors also code whether the victim was
a known perpetrator or victim of interpersonal vio-
lence during the month before death. Interpersonal
problems include, but are not limited to, intimate-
partner violence.18
For homicide victims, National Violent Death
Reporting System abstractors record cases in which a
homicide is related to conflict between current or
former intimate partners. Abstractors are instructed to
code this variable as "yes" if, after reviewing the
coroner or medical examiner records, police report,
and child fatality report if applicable, they find that
the death is perpetrated by an intimate partner or is
associated with intimate-partner violence or conflict.
The CDC defines an intimate partner as a current or
former girlfriend or boyfriend, date, or spouse in
relation to this variable. In addition, abstractors code
whether jealousy or distress over an intimate partner's
relationship or suspected relationship with another
personal led to the homicide (coded as jealousy
[lover's triangle]).18
For the purpose of this study, we limited our
analysis to women of reproductive age (15­54 years)
from the 16 states reporting complete data to the
National Violent Death Reporting System. The CDC
National Vital Statistics System reports birth and
maternal mortality information for women in the
category of "under 15. " However, we excluded
women younger than 15 years because of the ex-
tremely small sample size; the National Violent Death
Reporting System prohibits reporting of cells showing
or derived from fewer than five deaths (zero cells may
be shown) and rates computed from cells containing
less than 20 deaths or cases. Data were analyzed for
the years 2003­2007 because this was the most cur-
rent sample available for the National Violent Death
Reporting System.
The primary focus of this analysis was to estimate
the overall rate of pregnancy-associated homicide and
suicide, describe the demographic characteristics of
the victims associated with these deaths, and esti-
mate the prevalence of intimate partner conflict
related to these deaths. We calculated the rates of
pregnancy-associated homicide and suicide by divid-
ing the total number of pregnancy-associated homi-
cides and suicides, respectively, by the number of live
births in the sample population, using data from the
national natality files of the CDC.20 We converted the
results to maternal mortality rates by reporting the num-
1058 Palladino et al Pregnancy-Associated Homicide and Suicide OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
ber of deaths per 100,000 live births. We used descrip-
tive statistics to report demographic characteristics of
victims and the prevalence of intimate partner conflict
associated with the pregnancy-associated violent
deaths in our sample. We were unable to analyze data
for the perpetrator of interpersonal violence (suicides
only), victim of interpersonal violence (suicides only),
and jealousy (homicides only) because of high data
coded as "no/not available/unknown" together for
these variables, leaving us unable to differentiate
missing data from data coded as "no."
We used two-sample tests of proportions to com-
pare sociodemographic variables among victims of
pregnancy-associated homicide and pregnancy-asso-
ciated suicide with women with live births within the
National Violent Death Reporting System states dur-
ing the same time period using data from the national
natality files of the CDC.20 We also used a two-sample
test of proportions to compare the pregnancy-associ-
ated homicide and suicide rates, respectively, in the
National Violent Death Reporting System states using
the U.S. standard death certificate compared with
those that did not. P.05 was considered statistically
significant. This study was deemed Institutional Re-
view Board-exempt by the Institutional Review Board
of the University of Michigan Medical School.
RESULTS
In total, we identified 233 pregnancy-associated vio-
lent deaths, yielding an overall pregnancy-associated
violent death mortality rate of 4.9 per 100,000 live
births; 64.8% of the pregnancy-associated violent
deaths in our sample (n151) occurred during preg-
nancy (compared with the first year postpartum). The
overall pregnancy-associated violent death rate was
fairly stable over the study time period, ranging from
4.3 to 5.4 (Fig. 1). In addition, the rates of pregnancy-
associated homicide and suicide were each higher
than mortality rates attributable to common obstetric
causes (Fig. 2).38
There were 94 counts of pregnancy-associated sui-
cide in our sample, yielding a pregnancy-associated sui-
cide rate of 2.0 per 100,000 live births (Fig. 2). Forty-three
of the pregnancy-associated suicides occurred during
pregnancy (45.7%), and 51 occurred postpartum. Older
women were at greatest risk for pregnancy-associated
suicide (Table 1). Women 40 and older represented
17.0% of pregnancy-associated suicides but account for
just 2.8% of live births in the National Violent Death
Reporting System states (P.01). In addition, victims of
suicide were significantly more likely to be white or
Native American and more often were unmarried, as
compared with women with all live births in the National
Violent Death Reporting System states. The rate of
pregnancy-associated suicide did not differ signifi-
cantly between states that did and did not use the U.S.
standard death certificate (2.0 compared with 1.9,
P.90). We were unable to compare the percentage
of women who were Asian or Pacific Islander because
of the low number of deaths in this group.

and representing more than half (59.7%) of the total
pregnancy-associated violent deaths; 77.7% of the
pregnancy-associated homicides occurred in pregnant
women (compared with during the first year postpar-
tum). Women at the extremes of the age range were at
the highest risk for pregnancy-associated homicide
(Table 2). Women 24 years of age and younger
accounted for more than half (53.9%) of the pregnancy-
associated homicides in our sample but make up only
one-third (33.6%) of all live births in the National
Violent Death Reporting System states (P.01). In
addition, victims of homicide were significantly more
likely to be aged 40 years or older as compared with
women with all live births in the National Violent
Death Reporting System states. African American
women accounted for almost half (44.6%) of the
pregnancy-associated homicides but only 17.7% of
live births (P.01). Victims of pregnancy-associated
homicide were significantly more likely to be unmar-
ried. The rate of pregnancy-associated homicide did
not differ significantly between states that did and did
not use the U.S. standard death certificate (3.0 com-
pared with 3.7, P.22). We were unable to compare
the percentage of women who were Asian or Pacific
Islander or Native American because of the low
number of deaths in these groups.
In pregnancy-associated suicides, 54.3% of vic-
tims experienced problems with a current or former
intimate partner that appeared to have contributed to
the suicide, 45.3% of pregnancy-associated homicides
were associated with violence from a current or
former intimate partner, and 42.4% of suspects in
pregnancy-associated homicides were a current or
former intimate partner of the victim (n59), and this
is, by definition, intimate partner homicide. Similar to

victims of all pregnancy-associated homicides, victims
of pregnancy-associated intimate partner homicide
were younger, with women aged 24 years and
younger accounting for 44.1% of intimate-partner
homicides but only 33.6% of all live births, although
this did not reach statistical significance (Table 3).
African American women accounted for 37.3% of
pregnancy-associated intimate-partner homicides but
only 17.7% of live births (P.01). Victims of pregnancy-
associated intimate partner homicide were signifi-
cantly more likely to be unmarried as compared with
all live births. We were unable to compare the
percentage of women who were Asian or Pacific
Islander or Native American because of the low
number of deaths in these groups.
DISCUSSION
Our results indicate that pregnancy-associated homi-
cide and suicide each account for more deaths than
many other obstetric complications, which may be
thought of as more "traditional" causes of maternal
mortality, and confirm the need to focus on the
relationships between sociodemographic disparities
and intimate-partner violence with pregnancy-associ-
ated violent death. Our results demonstrate somewhat
higher maternal mortality rates than those previously
demonstrated in a national perinatal sample.23 Chang
et al23 reported a pregnancy-associated homicide rate
of 1.7 deaths per 100,000 live births between 1991
and 1999 in the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance
System. Suicides were even less common in their
sample. These differences may reflect the data collec-
tion methods used by the two systems. The Pregnancy
Mortality Surveillance System is designed to collect
data on all pregnancy-associated deaths, regardless of
cause. Reporting states use death certificate data or
matched death-to-birth certificate data to identify
deaths.23 The National Violent Death Reporting Sys-
tem is designed to collect data specifically associated
with violent deaths. Abstractors code pregnancy
and postpartum status based on findings from the
victim's death certificate and the medical examin-
er's report.18 Mortality rates from other smaller
studies of pregnancy-associated violent death have
been closer to our results for suicide deaths and
have demonstrated even higher mortality rates for
pregnancy-associated homicide.4,24,25
Despite these differences in mortality rates be-
tween the National Violent Death Reporting System
and Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, the
characteristics of pregnancy-associated homicide vic-
tims between the National Violent Death Reporting
System and others, including Pregnancy Mortality
Surveillance System, are strikingly similar. Victims of
pregnancy-associated homicide are more likely to be
African American, younger, and unmarried.23,24 In
addition, our finding of the association between inti-
mate partner conflict and both pregnancy-associated
homicide and suicide has been echoed by several
studies in general and perinatal samples.1,2,17,22,24 In
the National Violent Death Reporting System general
population sample, more than one-half of female
homicide deaths (59.1%) are associated with intimate-
partner violence, and more than one-quarter of sui-
cides in female victims (26.1%) were related to inti-
mate partner problems.22 In a postpartum study, 38%
of female homicide victims were killed by a boy-
friend, husband, or ex-husband.26

Our study has several limitations. Although the
National Violent Death Reporting System now col-
lects data from many states, it is not fully nationally
representative.22 Furthermore, because of the low
rates of deaths in certain subpopulations (Asian or
Pacific Islander and Native American), we were not
able to compare data among all ethnic groups. Na-
tional Violent Death Reporting System abstractors
are limited by the completeness and quality of the
reports they receive, and personnel, death certificates,
and law enforcement protocols may vary from one
jurisdiction to the next. For this reason, the National
Violent Death Reporting System uses multiple com-
plementary data sources and abstractors follow de-
fined National Violent Death Reporting System pri-
macy rules in coding data.22 Although the National
Violent Death Reporting System codes pregnant and
postpartum status from multiple data sources, preg-
nancy-associated deaths may still be underreported.
Pregnancies, even if identified, may not be reported
on death certificates, autopsies might not include
examination for pregnancy,27 early gestation and late
postpartum status may be missed on autopsy, and
family members and friends may have been unaware
of early or unwanted pregnancies. Also, because a
majority of female deaths in the National Violent
Death Reporting System are coded as unknown preg-
nancy or postpartum status (67.2%), our results may
underestimate the number of pregnancy-associated
violent deaths. In addition, we are unable to compare
the rates of pregnancy-associated violent death in
pregnant postpartum compared with nonpregnant
nonpostpartum women because so many deaths were
classified as unknown status. Finally, protective factor
data would be helpful but are not collected by the
National Violent Death Reporting System because
reports associated with violent death often contain
only circumstances associated with risk factors. Our
data provide information regarding potential risk
factors for maternal violent deaths but cannot prove
causation. In addition, this analysis focuses on demo-
graphic data and prevalence of intimate partner con-
flict among victims of pregnancy-associated violent
data but did not cover all of the potential precipitating
circumstances that may be related to violent death.
Our future research will involve analyses of other
potential precipitating circumstances around mater-
nal violent death, including substance abuse, life
stress, and mental health diagnoses and treatment.
Despite these limitations, our study highlights the
unfortunate but important role of homicide and sui-
cide as contributors to pregnancy-associated mortal-
ity. These findings suggest that effective prevention
methods aimed at perinatal psychosocial health are
imperative. Unlike some obstetric complications, vi-
olence is potentially preventable. Research is moving
forward in developing evidence-based guidelines for
perinatal depression care,31 identifying successful
strategies for engaging and training perinatal health
care providers in delivering mental health care32,33
and engaging perinatal women in receiving mental
health care services.34 Our findings also demonstrate
the frequent association of intimate partner conflict
with maternal violent death. Intimate-partner vio-
lence has been associated with adverse outcomes for
both woman and neonate, including preterm labor
and low birth weight, and may contribute to perinatal
health disparities.35 Studies suggest that standardized
screening for intimate-partner violence is associated
with increased identification rates in pregnant
women, and a recent intervention was shown to lower
recurrence risk for intimate-partner violence victim-
ization during pregnancy and the postpartum pe-
riod.37 With continued focus on maternal violent
death and a continued push toward the development
of effective psychosocial interventions, particularly
postscreening care, we may be able to reduce the
effect of this unfortunate killer on American women,
their children, and their families.
