Abstract
Objective To understand area-based sociodemographics,
physician and medical practice characteristics, and com-
munity indicators associated with mammography use in Los
Angeles County. An earlier multi-level analysis by Gum-
pertz et al. found that distance to the nearest mammography
facility helped explain the higher proportion of Latinas
diagnosed with late stage breast cancer compared with non-
Latina Whites in Los Angeles County. Our study examined
whether Latinas also have lower rates of mammography use.
Methods We used a multi-level spatial modeling approach
to examine individual and community level associations
with mammography use among a diverse group of women
aged 40­84 years in Los Angeles County. To build our
multi-level spatial data set, we integrated five data sources:
(1) 2001 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) data, (2)
2001 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) certified mam-
mography facility data, (3) 2003 LA Transit Authority data,
(4) 2000 US Decennial Census data, and (5) 2001 Commu-
nity Tracking Study (CTS) Physician's Survey data.
Results Our study confirmed for Los Angeles County
many associations for mammography use found in other
locations. An unexpected finding was that women with
limited English proficiency (predominantly Latina) were
significantly more likely to have had a recent mammogram
than English-proficient women. We also found that, after
controlling for other factors, mammography use was higher
in neighborhoods with a greater density of mammography
facilities.
Conclusion Women with limited English proficiency
were especially likely to report recent mammography in
Los Angeles. This unexpected finding suggests that the
intensive Spanish-language outreach program conducted
by the Every Woman Counts (EWC) Program in low-
income Latina communities in Los Angeles has been
effective. Our study highlights the success of this targeted
community-based outreach conducted between 1999 and
2001. These are the same populations that Gumpertz et al.
identified as needing intervention. It would be useful to
conduct another study of late-stage diagnosis in Los
Angeles County to ascertain whether increased rates of
mammography have also led to less late-stage diagnosis
among Latinas in the neighborhoods where they are con-
centrated in Los Angeles.

Introduction
Regular mammography use in the United States involves
repeated interactions by women with health care providers.
These interactions are mediated by health care markets
within the broader social and economic environment. Even
though these interactions take place in specific geographic
locations in a particular social and economic environment,
research has not adequately explored how specific geo-
graphic, social and economic environments influence
mammography use.
An extensive body of research elucidating the determi-
nants of mammography use has largely focused on corre-
lates associated with adherence to recommended screening
intervals that can be measured by self-report [1­3]. These
include sociodemographic characteristics such as income,
education, and age [4­6]; psychosocial influences such as
culture, risk perception, and social support [7­11]; and
health care access determinants such as provider recom-
mendation and health insurance status [12, 13].
In this study, we used a multi-level spatial analysis to
investigate howplace ofresidence,densityorproximitytoone
or more mammography facilities, and other community level
variables can help us better understand patterns of mam-
mography use in Los Angeles County. An earlier multi-level
analysis by Gumpertz et al. found that the higher proportion of
Latinasdiagnosed withlate stage breastcancercomparedwith
non-Latina Whites in Los Angeles County could be explained
by differences in tumor biology, sociodemographic and
neighborhood characteristics, and distance to the nearest
mammography facility [14]. Other investigations have shown
that place of residence influences health outcomes [15, 16],
including stage of cancer diagnosis [17].
In recent years, multi-level analytic methods have been
employed to simultaneously distinguish the effects of area-
level and individual-level factors on a range of health
outcomes [14, 18­20]. Multi-level approaches consistently
have found associations between contextual variables and
health outcomes above and beyond individual characteris-
tics [21­23]. Because contextual and individual factors
interact with one another [24], addressing the interplay of
these factors, rather than focusing exclusively on a single
factor, can enhance efforts to promote mammography. In
this paper, we examine a range of multi-level factors that
may influence mammography in Los Angeles County.
Methods
Conceptual framework and data sources
To conceptualize on-schedule mammography screening,
we adapted a multi-level systems framework that integrates
individual, practice, and community variables [25]. The
three levels of our framework are: (A) Practice setting/
individual level which includes (1) individual patient
characteristics, (2) clinician or provider team characteris-
tics, and (3) encounters between doctor and patient; (B)
Plan or medical group level which includes policies that
can affect delivery of services, such as accepting patients
without health insurance, and (C) Social and economic
context/community level which includes factors that
impact access and availability of mammography, such as
the density of facilities or community poverty level.
We linked five data sets to test our systems framework.
Our systems framework and geographic nesting structure is
shown in Figure 1. The five nested data sets correspond to
the three levels in our framework: the practice setting/
individual level, the plan level, and the social and eco-
nomic context or community level. In order to determine
the most appropriate geographic aggregation for each data
set, we tested three geographic units: the Census Tract,
Health District (HD), and Service Planning Area (SPA).
These latter two geographic units are specific to Los
Angeles County and were developed for purposes of health
and social service planning and service distribution. The 26
HDs and 8 SPAs reflect the health care needs of local
communities in LA County.
Individual-level data were obtained from the California
Health Interview Survey (CHIS). CHIS, conducted every
2 years, is a random-digit-dial (RDD) telephone survey of
adults, adolescents, and children from all California
counties. The first survey, conducted in 2001 in five lan-
guages, collected information from more than 55,000
households statewide. CHIS is the largest state health
survey, one of the largest health surveys in the United
States, and one of the few to report county and community
level information. By providing information on many racial
and ethnic groups and local-level information, CHIS gives
health planners, policy makers, county governments,
advocacy groups, and communities a detailed picture of the
health and health care needs facing California's diverse
population. The CHIS conducts multi-language interviews
to accommodate the state's large immigrant population.
Geocoding provides the opportunity to link CHIS to other
data and to perform spatial analysis. Los Angeles was the
only county fully geocoded in 2001 CHIS.
Our study sample includes women in Los Angeles
County aged 40­84 years who responded to the 2001
CHIS. Geocoding to latitude/longitude was successful for
approximately 70% of the respondents based on the nearest
street intersection to their residence, information they
provided in the interview. Remaining respondents were
geocoded to ZIP Code centroids. All geocoding was done
using ESRI's ArcMap software, supplemented by manual
lookup. Twenty respondents had neither a complete

address nor ZIP Code information and were deleted. The
resulting study sample of 4,249 women ages 40­84 was
linked to the other data sets. All variables tested, regardless
of whether we included them in our final models, are
shown in the complete variable list in Table 1. Only the
variables included in the logistic regression model are
presented in Table 2, which also shows the distribution of
individual-level CHIS respondent sample characteristics.
In the paragraphs below, we describe the data sets used
to measure each level of our conceptual framework, the
variables we considered, and the variables included in the
best fitting statistical models.
Practice setting/individual level: The practice setting
is measured as a relationship between the patient and the
clinician or team of clinicians. Different practice settings
are associated in the literature with different screening
practices [25­32]. 1. Patient characteristics: women
sampled in the 2001 California Health Interview Survey
(CHIS) aged 40­84 from Los Angeles County were used to
estimate on-schedule mammography by patient sociode-
mographics. All geographic data are linked to this sample
of women. We examined information on race/ethnicity,
age, education, income, marital status, and English lan-
guage proficiency as well as indicators of health and health
care access. 2. Clinician/team characteristics: to measure
practice and personal characteristics of clinicians, we used
the 2001 Community Tracking Study (CTS) Physician's
Survey. The CTS includes sixty sites nationally (51
metropolitan areas and 9 nonmetropolitan areas) that were
randomly selected to form the core of the survey and to be
representative of the nation.
Los Angeles County was randomly selected as one site
and is used in the present analysis. The CTS Physician
survey data were sampled at the ZIP Code level and
includes responses from 220 clinicians. The physician
sample did not have adequate power at the Zip Code level
so responses were aggregated to the SPA level using a
crosswalk file. Only aggregate CTS Physician Survey data
at the SPA level were large enough to have adequate sta-
tistical power. We linked the SPA CTS physician data to
CHIS respondent data. See Table 1 (total variable list) for
the list of provider variables that we considered.
3. Encounters/interactions between doctor and
patients: Similar to those of patients, the sociodemo-
graphic characteristics of individual clinicians and medical
groups as well as the medical plan structure within which
they work, may facilitate or impede regular screening. We
created two indices from the CTS data to characterize
doctor and patient interactions: ability to provide quality
care to patients and ease of quality referrals.
Plan or medical group level: As outlined earlier, the
CTS physician survey data were tested for factors that
could influence mammography use in a given geographic
area. These included the clinician or team characteristics,
the reported interactions of providers with patients at the
plan or medical group level and the percentage of medical
practice revenue obtained from various types of reim-
bursement. The percentage of practices that did not accept
MediCAL (California's Medicaid program) was used as an
indicator of access to care for low-income women at the
plan or medical group level.
Social and economic context/community level: We
used data on location of mammography facility, bus and
rail stop locations, and neighborhood sociodemographic
characteristics to measure the social and economic context
at the community levels. These measures were obtained
from the FDA Certified Mammography Facility Address
data base [33], the LA County Metro Transit Authority
Route and Stop database [34], and the US Census for
Census tracts [35] and were linked to the individual-level
CHIS respondent data to examine their association with
access to on-schedule mammography screening.
Measuring geographic access
A measure of special interest to us was geographic access
to mammography. Precise address information for FDA
certified mammography facilities from 2001 was used to
create two measures potentially associated with access to
mammography screening by using a geographic informa-
tion system (GIS). The first measure is the Euclidean, or
straight-line distance from the respondent's address (or Zip
Code centroid) to the nearest facility. For the second, we
created an alternative measure that indicates the density of
facilities within a limited circular buffer immediately sur-
rounding the respondent's address. These methods of
aggregation have been previously referred to as ``person-
centered'' because the respondents' address determines the
center of the buffer and the density of facilities surrounding
a respondent's residence [36].
Measuring the distance to the facility nearest to a
respondent's address provides an estimate of the closest
facility while density measures the number of facilities
within a designated geographic area. The density of facil-
ities surrounding a respondent's residence also represents
greater choice of facilities. Because distance and density
are conceptually different aspects of potential access and
may yield different results, we examined both measures.
To decide which measure to use, we first calculated
density. A GIS was used to calculate 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10-
mile buffers immediately surrounding a woman's place of
residence. We then computed the number of FDA certified
mammography facilities within each buffer. Statistical
modeling was used to determine the single most appro-
priate buffer distance because overlapping buffers were
collinear. After trying a priori distance cutoffs for each

buffer density variable, we selected the model with the 2-
mile buffer of mammography facility density because it
had the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [37],
indicating the best statistical fit.
Los Angeles County Metro Transit Authority (LAMTA)
bus route and rail line stop data were computed as the
combination of all routes and individual stops for each
transit location per day. Bus and rail data from 2003 were
manipulated similar to the person-centered density variable
for mammography facilities described earlier. A 3-mile
buffer distance was selected for inclusion in the model
using the lowest AIC.
We tested aggregate information on demographic and
socioeconomic data from the 2000 US Decennial Census
(Sample File 3) at each geographic unit described earlier:
the Census Tract, HD, and SPA. Based on the distribution
of CHIS respondents in each geographic area and the sta-
tistical selection criteria outline below, we aggregated
Census information to the HD level. A detailed list of these
variables is included in Table 1.
Statistical analysis
We used a combination of theoretical and statistical pro-
cedures to select and specify variables for our models from
the list of variables shown in Table 1. Several covariates
considered for inclusion on theoretical grounds were
deleted due to collinearity. For the remaining continuous
covariates, we determined appropriate transformations
using logit plots. If the association between mammography
use (as measured by the logit, ln(p/(1 ? p)), where p is the
probability of mammography use) and a covariate was
linear then the covariate was included in the model as a
continuous variable. If a simple transformation such as the
square root of a covariate did not achieve linearity, then the
covariate was categorized. Income (in thousands of dol-
lars), age, and body mass index (BMI) were categorized.
Age was categorized into four groups: 40­49, 50­64, 65­
74, and 75­84 years. We used US Preventive Services
Task Force (USPSTFS) and Medicare eligibility guidelines
to determine appropriate categorizations for age. BMI was
grouped into three conventional categories: underweight
(0­18.49), normal weight (18.5­24.99), and overweight
(25.0?). The density of FDA certified mammography
facilities within 2 miles of each respondent's home was
converted into quartiles (0­1, 2­4, 5­10, and 11?). Simi-
larly, public transit stops within 3 miles of each respondent
were converted into quartiles (0­110, 111­464, 465­879,
880? stops).
Single-variable logistic models were used to select the
2- and 3-mile density measures for mammography facili-
ties and public transportation respectively. As described
earlier, ZIP Code, Census tract, HD, and SPA levels were
examined to determine the most appropriate level of
aggregation and each was tested in separate models; only
SPA covariates were used in our final models.
All possible two-way interactions of the main effects were
tested for significance at the a = 0.0001 level using a fixed
effects logistic forward stepwise selection procedure [38].
This criterion is more stringent than the usual a = 0.05 level
in order to adjust for multiple comparisons [39].
Our final analysis used a logistic generalized linear
mixed effects model [40]. Additional variance components
were included to account for overdispersion and spatial
autocorrelation. Our final four models were chosen after
comparing the AIC statistic [37] and goodness of fit, as
determined by residual analysis and by the Hosmer-Lem-
eshow statistic [41]. A three-way interaction of Hispanic
ethnicity, age, and usual source of care was added to
improve model fit, as suggested by the residual analysis.
Separate models were used to test the importance of the
practice setting and social context covariates.
Results
Only the variables that met the theoretical and statistical
criteria described earlier and that were selected for the
logistic generalized linear mixed effects model are dis-
cussed, and only statistically significant results are repor-
ted. We present our results organized by the levels of
analysis in our conceptual model.

Description of sample (see Table 2)
Sociodemographics: Fifty-five percent of women aged 40­
84 in LA County reported white race/ethnicity, 18%
reported Latina, and 12% each reported black or Asian/
Pacific Islander. Roughly 1/3 of women were 40­49, 1/3
were 50­64, and 1/3 were 65 and older. Forty percent
reported either being a high school graduate or having less
than a high school education; 28% some college or tech-
nical school; and 32% reported a college education or
more. Fifty-four percent of our study sample reported an
annual income less than the $35,000 midpoint. About an
even percentage were married or living with a partner vs.
being single. Sixteen percent were not English proficient.
Health status and health care access variables: Eleven
percent reported a history of breast cancer. Forty-six per-
cent reported being in very good or excellent health. Eight
percent reported no usual source of care and fourteen
percent no insurance coverage.
Person-centered access: Within a 2-mile buffer around
each respondent's home address, there was a mean of eight
mammography facilities. There was a mean of 644 transit
stops within a 3-mile buffer around each respondent's
home address.

Table 3 presents odds ratios for the sociodemographic,
practice setting, and community variables. Four models are
presented. The first tests individual-level variables. The
second model also includes individual-level interactions.
The third model adds variables that describe clinician/team
characteristics, encounters between patients and providers
and plan-level characteristics. The fourth model adds social
context and community level variables. These include
measures of density of mammography facilities and bus
stops. None of the clinician/team characteristics proved
significant so they were left out of the fourth model.
Individual characteristics examined in Model 1 were
based on findings from previous literature on mammogra-
phy [42­46]. In Model 1, women who reported their race as
Asian/Pacific Islander were less likely to report having a
mammogram within the previous 2 years (OR = 0.61)
compared with other women. The small proportion of
women grouped into ``other'' race also was less likely to be
on-schedule for breast cancer screening (OR = 0.67).
Women 40­49 years of age were less likely to report
having a mammogram within the past 2 years (OR = 0.51)
compared with women 65­84 years of age. Women with
low income were less likely to have had a recent mam-
mogram ($3,000 midpoint OR = 0.43; $8,000 midpoint
OR = 0.60; and $18,000 midpoint OR = 0.63) than the
most affluent respondents in our CHIS sample.
Women with a previous breast cancer diagnosis
(OR = 1.61), a usual source of health care (OR = 3.17), or
insurance coverage in the past 12 months (OR = 1.53)
were significantly more likely than others to report a recent
mammogram.
Significant interactions between age, English profi-
ciency, and having a usual source of health care were found
for Models 2­4. Of the odds ratios shown in Table 3 for
these combinations of individual characteristics, the pattern
among women ages 50­64 is unusual. Women in this age
group who had a usual source of health care and had
limited English proficiency (predominantly Latina) were
significantly more likely (OR = 1.85) to have a recent
mammogram than English-proficient women of the same
age who had a usual source of care.
2. Clinician/team characteristics
3. Encounters/interactions between doctors and patients
None of the variables that represent clinician/team
characteristics and encounters/interactions within the
practice setting were significant in our results (Model 3 in
Table 3).
Plan or medical group level
Additionally, the plan or medical group level was not
significant in our results (Model 3 in Table 3).
Social and economic context/community level
Model 4, which includes person-centered access vari-
ables of mammography and transportation density, was the
best model as indicated by the smaller AIC statistic. Model
4 was slightly better than Model 2 which was identical
except for the person-centered variables. Model 4 showed
increasing likelihood of a recent mammogram as the
number of mammography facilities within 2 miles of the
respondent's home increased. Women with the fewest
number of nearby facilities (none or 1) had the lowest odds
ratio (OR = 0.76) compared with those with 11 or more
facilities nearby. Women with 2­4 and 5­10 facilities
nearby had intermediate odds ratios (OR = 0.98 and 0.81,
respectively). The interrupted gradient of density of facil-
ities to mammography use may be due to SES differences

and unmeasured factors such as proximity of a mammog-
raphy facility to a women's workplace or other locations
she frequents. It may also mean that there is little differ-
ence between having 2­10 facilities nearby. Density of
public transportation stops within 3 miles of a respondent's
residence was not associated with mammography use.
Discussion
Our study examined area-level and individual-level effects
on mammography use for women in Los Angeles County.
Gumpertz et al. had found that a longer distance from the
population center of the census tract to the nearest mam-
mography facility predicted more advanced disease for
Latina and White women after controlling for other
important factors [14]. This led us to hypothesize that a
lack of nearby mammography facilities would lead to less
mammography use, which in turn would lead to a later-
stage diagnosis of breast cancer. Consistent with this
hypothesis, we found an increased use of mammography
when many facilities were nearby. At the same time, our
study confirmed the significance of individual characteris-
tics found to be important predictors of mammography use
in other studies [42­46].
Our most striking and unexpected findings were
revealed by the interactions. Not surprisingly, women aged
40­49 were less likely to have had a mammogram than
women aged 50­64--an age group for which mammog-
raphy is recommended by evidence-based guidelines in the
United States [47]. For women under 65 not covered by
Medicare, lack of usual source of care is usually strongly
associated with lower mammography rates. However,
among the 50­64 years old group who had a usual source
of health care in Los Angeles, we found that women with
limited or no English proficiency were more likely than
English-proficient women to obtain a mammogram. These
unexpected findings were consistent across all the models.
To help explain this finding, we examined data on
127,000 women screened in Los Angeles during 1999­
2001 by their race-ethnicity from the Cancer Detection
Section (CDS) of the California Department of Health
Services. Comparing the percent of eligible women who
actually used the program to those eligible, we found
proportional underrepresentation among whites (18% eli-
gible and 7% users of program) and blacks (9% eligible
and 3% users); and overrepresentation among Latinas (64%
eligible and 70% users) and Asian/Pacific Islanders (API)
(9 percent eligible and 11 percent users). Further investi-
gation showed that the Every Women Counts Program
(EWC), directed by a community-based organization in
Los Angeles County, had conducted outreach between
1999 and 2001 that targeted Spanish-speaking Latinas. The
EWC program, co-funded by the CDC BCCEDP and
California state, provides subsidized breast and cervical
cancer screening services to low income underinsured
residents. The program's education and outreach to Span-
ish-speaking Latinas comprised a number of different
strategies including an ``over 50 task force'' and a
``grandmother's campaign'' with community participation
on task forces and committees (Brian Montano, personal
communication, 1 May 2008).The program sponsored a
Mother's Day campaign in which providers were given
reminder cards to use with their patients. Providers were
encouraged to emphasize the importance of screening and
re-screening to community members. The program also
helped providers participating in the EWC Program
develop manual and computerized tracking systems to
notify women that they were due for screening (Patricia
Smith Francis, personal communication, 29 August 2008).
This reliance on health care providers to encourage women
to be screened, with a particular emphasis on Latinas over
age 50, is probably why English fluency, age, and usual
source of care significantly interacted to predict mam-
mography use in our models.
Our results suggest that this campaign succeeded in
reaching communities in need. The communities targeted
in the outreach campaigns were the same ones that Gum-
pertz reported were disproportionately impacted by late
stage breast cancer. Previous literature has shown that
organized communities and social networks can effectively
promote use of services, including cancer screening [48,
49]. Our findings for LA County in the context of the
community-based outreach program to promote mam-
mography among Latinas confirmed this.
Ouranalysisconfirmedlowuse ofmammographybyAsian
women, women 40­49 and lower-income women in Los
Angeles [50, 51]. We confirmed greater use by women in the
50­64 and 65­84 age groups, those with a personal history of
breast cancer, and those with a usual source of care and health
insurance coverage. Previous findings have shown these
individual variables are correlated with recent mammography
use both for the nation and for Los Angeles [52, 53].
Our study is the first to show an association between use
of mammography and density of mammography facilities
within 2 miles of a woman's residence. We also examined
an alternative measure, distance of mammography facili-
ties in relation to a respondent's residence. This is the
measure used in the Gumpertz et al. article; however, odds
ratios using this measure were small and not statistically
significant (data not shown) so we used the mammography
density measure instead.
Our study benefitted from having an address for each
woman and for each mammography facility, from which
more precise locations and associations could be measured
[54]. Most previous studies, including that of Gumpertz
Cancer Causes Control (2009) 20:1469­1482 1479
123
et al. have assigned respondents to aggregated geographic
units, such as Census tracts, counties, or zip codes. Krieger
et al. have shown that it is important to compare socio-
economic status using small geographic units such as tracts
in order to identify health inequalities [55].
The above finding suggests that a woman's proximity
to the closest facility may not be as important as living in
an area with a greater density of facilities. As indicated in
the methods section, the density variable potentially
captures more aspects of access than the proximity vari-
able and may explain why only the density variable is
associated with mammography use. Another possible
explanation is that using the exact location of residence as
we did in our study is a more accurate measure compared
with using a Census tract centroid in the calculation of
proximity, the address surrogate used in the Gumpertz
study. Our finding that density of mammography facilities
is an important determinant of mammography use sug-
gests that examining the supply of mammography facili-
ties, including capacity, location and staffing, needs
additional study.
Limitations
The geocoded location of each woman was based on her
reported nearest street intersection, not her exact address.
The geocoding process has been shown to introduce some
positional inaccuracies, but resulting locations are gener-
ally within 100 m of the true location [56]. Because most
of LA County is very urban, we expect that most of the
geocoded locations are very close to the actual residence.
However, location of workplace was not available from the
CHIS survey. It is likely that some women who work
would find it convenient to have their mammograms at
facilities close to their workplace, especially if there were
few facilities available near their home.
Transit data throughout LA County were incomplete
because data on rail lines run by Municipal Operators and
Foothill Transit in LA County were not available. How-
ever, the Metro Transit Authority (MTA) estimates that
these rail lines would add only 15% more rail stops to the
present analysis (Dr. Jesse Simmon, personal communi-
cation, 24 January 2005).
The distribution of data was not adequate at all levels
of geography. This limited our ability to test some vari-
ables. Though we do not know exactly how this limitation
affected our analysis, it is likely that the sample of phy-
sician practice characteristics was too small to provide
adequate power to detect differences in Los Angeles. In
addition, CHIS data are self-reported and previous anal-
yses have shown that mammography may be over-repor-
ted in surveys, particularly among racial/ethnic groups
[57, 58].
Conclusions
Women with limited English proficiency were especially
likely to report recent mammography in Los Angeles. This
unexpected finding suggests that the intensive Spanish-
language outreach program conducted by the EWC Pro-
gram in low-income Latina communities in Los Angeles
was effective. Our spatial analysis of mammography use in
Los Angeles was inspired by Gumpertz et al. who found
that Latinas in Los Angeles County were diagnosed with
later stage breast cancer than other women (1992­1996)
and that distance from the population center of the Census
tract to the nearest mammography facility was a significant
predictor of advanced disease. Our study highlights the
success of the targeted community-based outreach con-
ducted between 1999 and 2001 which addressed the same
populations that Gumpertz et al. identified as needing
intervention. It would be useful to conduct another study of
late-stage diagnosis in Los Angeles County to ascertain
whether increased rates of mammography also led to less
late-stage diagnosis among Latinas in the neighborhoods
where they are concentrated in Los Angeles.
