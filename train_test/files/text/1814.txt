Background. Endemic measles transmission was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000. To ensure that
elimination can be maintained, high population immunity must be sustained and monitored. Testing for measles
antibody was included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally represen-
tative survey, conducted during 1999­2004.
Methods. A measles-specific immunoassay was used to measure the seroprevalence of measles antibody in
NHANES participants 6­49 years of age. For analysis, participants were grouped by birth cohort.
Results. During 1999­2004, the rate of measles seropositivity in the population overall was 95.9% (95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 95.1%­96.5%). The highest seroprevalence of measles antibody was in non-Hispanic blacks
(98.6% [95% CI, 98.0%­99.1%]). Those born during 1967­1976 had significantly lower levels of measles antibody
(92.4% [95% CI, 90.8%­93.9%]) than did the other birth cohorts. Independent predictors of measles seropositivity in
the 1967­1976 birth cohort were non-Hispanic/black race/ethnicity, more than a high school education, having
health insurance, and birth outside the United States.
Conclusions. Measles seropositivity was uniformly high in the US population during 1999­2004. Nearly all
population subgroups had evidence of measles seropositivity levels greater than the estimated threshold necessary to
sustain measles elimination. Non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans born during 1967­1976 had the lowest
measles seropositivity levels and represent populations that might be at increased risk for measles disease if the virus
were reintroduced into the United States.
Measles is a highly infectious disease that can cause rash,
fever, diarrhea, pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. Al-
though measles is endemic in most of the world, in
March 2000 the ongoing transmission of measles virus
was declared to be eliminated in the United States, an
achievement attributed to the success of the vaccination
program [1]. Measles vaccine was introduced in the
United States during 1963. The vaccination program
consisted of routine vaccination of infants and immuni-
zation of all susceptible children either when they en-
tered school or at other places of congregation; however,
school immunization laws started in all states during
1981. Although school immunization requirements
were extremely effective in reducing measles in school-
children, a single dose of measles vaccine was not suffi-
cient to prevent transmission in all settings. Therefore, a
second dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) for
school-age children was recommended during 1989 [2].
The increase of vaccination coverage of children 19­35
months of age--to 90% since 1996 [2]--and the in-
creased second-dose coverage of children in all grades, as
recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immuni-
zation Practices during 1998 [3], led to a dramatic de-
crease in the incidence of measles, which has been 1
case/million since 1997 [4­6]. Since 1997, most cases
have been associated with importations of the disease
[4­6]. The importation of measles into the United

States is a reminder that population immunity must be moni-
tored to ensure that levels of measles antibody remain high
enough to maintain the elimination of endemic measles trans-
mission in the United States.
Estimates of the national seroprevalence of measles IgG anti-
body were first determined by the National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES) III, conducted during
1988­1994 [7]. At that time, the seroprevalence of measles an-
tibody was 93%, with significant differences by race/ethnicity
and birth cohort. Mathematical models have estimated that the
herd immunity threshold necessary to interrupt measles trans-
mission in the United States is 93%­95% [8]. Data from
NHANES III demonstrated that many population subgroups
had prevalence estimates below this level and could therefore
sustain a measles outbreak if the virus was reintroduced. To con-
tinue to monitor measles serostatus in the US population, testing
for measles antibody was included in NHANES 1999­2004. The
present study considers the seroprevalence of measles antibody
in participants who were 6­49 years of age during these survey
years, to assess national immunization efforts and to reassess
whether any deficiencies in the levels of measles antibody still
exist in parts of the US population.
METHODS
Survey design and participants. The NHANES is conducted
by the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), to provide national statistics on
the health and nutritional status of the noninstitutionalized ci-
vilian population through household interviews, standardized
physical examinations, and the collection of biologic samples in
special mobile examination centers [9]. In 1999, NHANES be-
came a continuous survey, with data release every 2 years. The
sampling plan for the survey was a stratified, multistage,
probability-cluster design, to provide a sample that is represen-
tative of the US population [9]. Black Americans, Mexican
Americans, adolescents, and low-income persons were sampled
at higher frequencies than were other participants, to provide
stable estimates for these groups.
Serum samples from participants 6­49 years of age were
available for testing for the presence of measles antibody. Race/
ethnic group was categorized on the basis of a subject's self-
identification as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or
Mexican American. Subjects who did not fit into one of these
categories were classified as "other" and were analyzed with the
total population but not in terms of a separate racial/ethnic sub-
group. Other variables analyzed with the NHANES 1999­2004
test results include (1) family income based on a poverty-index
ratio, calculated by dividing total family income by the poverty-
threshold index adjusted for family size at year of the interview
and categorized as either below the poverty level (1) or at or
above the poverty level (1) [10]; (2) birthplace, categorized as
within or outside the United States; (3) health insurance, cate-
gorized as any or none; and (4) regular health-care provider,
defined as at least 1 regular source of health care. For those
20­49 years of age, education was measured as last year of
school completed and was categorized into 3 levels (less than
high school graduate, high school graduate, and more than a
high school education); marital status was grouped as ever or
never married.
Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the
Ethical Review Board of the National Center for Health Statistics
of the CDC approved the protocol.
Laboratory testing. Levels of measles IgG antibody were
measured by an in-house enzyme immunoassay that used a ly-
sate of measles virus­infected human fetal diploid lung cells
(HFDL) as the viral antigen and a lysate of uninfected HFDL
from the same passage as the control antigen (California State
Department of Public Health) [11]. All sera were tested at a sin-
gle dilution of 1:200. Measles serostatus was determined by using
an index that was calculated by subtracting the absorbance of
control-antigen wells from the mean optical-density value of the
duplicate viral-antigen wells and dividing the result by the pre-
determined cutoff value, which was defined as the mean  3 SD
absorbance obtained for a large number of sera that tested neg-
ative for measles by immunofluorescent-antibody and plaque re-
duction­neutralization assays. An index value 1.0 was consid-
ered to be an indication of the presence of measles antibody.
Statistical analysis. To assess the seroprevalence of measles
antibody in the study population overall, participants were
grouped into cohorts based on birth years, to capture difference
over time, in measles-antibody response to change in vaccina-
tion policies. To ensure that there was a sufficient sample size for
each group, participants were grouped into the following birth
cohorts: (1) 1949­1966, the era before the federal initiative for
measles elimination; (2) 1967­1976, the early implementation
of the vaccination program; (3) 1977­1986, the more fully im-
plemented vaccine era; and (4) 1987­1998, the most recent era.
Estimates of seroprevalence were weighted to represent the total
civilian noninstitutionalized US household population and to
account for oversampling and nonresponse to the household
interview and physical examination [12]. SEs were calculated by
SUDAAN, a family of statistical procedures for analysis of data
from complex sample surveys [13]. Estimates were considered to
be unstable if the relative SE around the proportion of partici-
pants who were not seropositive for measles IgG antibody was
30%; 95% confidence intervals [CIs] were calculated by an
exact binominal method for calculation of CIs [14]. Differences
between seroprevalences were evaluated by examination of P
values calculated by a univariate t statistic obtained from a gen-
eral linear contrast procedure in SUDAAN; P  .05 was consid-
ered to be significant.

antibody (i.e., birth cohort 1967­1976)--and that therefore was
at greater risk for infection--a backward stepwise logistic mod-
eling procedure in SUDAAN was used, where a P  .05 from
the Satterthwaite adjusted F statistic was considered to be signif-
icant. There were no significant interactions between birth co-
hort and the included demographic variables. Odds ratios and
their 95% CIs are reported for all significant cofactors that re-
mained in the final model.
RESULTS
Response rates. Of the 18,433 participants 6­49 years of age
who were interviewed for NHANES 1999­2004, 17,672 (96%)
were examined by a physician, and 16,049 (11% of those exam-
ined) had their sera tested for the presence of measles antibody.
Of those examined, the percentage of participants tested for the
presence of measles antibody was lower (1) in non-Hispanic
blacks (89%; P  .001, in pairwise comparisons with non-
Hispanic whites [91%] and with Mexican Americans [92%])
than in non-Hispanic whites and in Mexican Americans and (2)
in US-born participants than in foreign-born participants (90%
vs. 92%). The percentage of those tested was lowest in the young-
est age group (6­11 years of age [83%]), with no other consistent
trends with age being observed (range in the other age groups,
91%-95%). The percentage of participants whose sera was tested
did not vary by sex or poverty index.
Seroprevalence of measles antibody. During 1999­2004,
in the US population 6­49 years of age, the overall seropreva-
lence of measles IgG antibody was 95.9% (95% CI, 95.1%­96.5%)
(table 1). Figure 1 depicts the seroprevalence by birth cohort,
with the youngest and oldest birth cohorts expanded into 2 ad-
ditional groups (1949­1956 [n  1069] and 1997­1998
[n  119]) to reflect changes in epidemiology and vaccination
program­implementation efforts over time. The seroprevalence
by birth cohort was similar for non-Hispanic whites and Mexi-
can Americans and was lowest in participants born during 1967­
1976. In non-Hispanic blacks, the seroprevalence by birth co-
hort was less variable.
Predictors of the presence of measles antibody. The sero-
prevalence of measles antibody in non-Hispanic blacks (98.6%
[95% CI, 98.0%­99.1%]) was significantly higher than that in
non-Hispanic whites (95.5% [95% CI, 94.5%­96.3%]), in all
birth cohorts combined (P  .001) and in each of the individual
birth cohorts (P  .05) (table 1). The seroprevalence of measles
antibody in Mexican Americans (94.1% [95% CI,
93.1%­95.1%]) was lower than that in non-Hispanic whites, in
all birth cohorts combined (P  .05) and in the 1977­1986
birth cohort (P  .01). Also, non-Hispanic blacks had a signif-
icantly higher seroprevalence than did Mexican Americans, in all
birth cohorts combined (P  .001) and in those born after 1966
(comparisons not presented in table 1).
In the 1949­1966 birth cohort, foreign-born participants
were significantly more likely to have measles antibody (98.4%
[95% CI, 97.0%­99.3%]) than were US-born participants
(96.2% [95% CI, 95.0%­97.2%]) (P  .01); in the later birth
cohorts, there were no significant differences between these 2
groups. In Mexican Americans, there were no differences be-
tween foreign-born and US-born participants until the 1977­
1986 birth cohort; the difference was of borderline significance
in this birth cohort (P  .08) but increased in the 1987­1996
birth cohort, with 91.8% (95% CI, 87.5%­95.0%) of foreign-
born Mexican Americans being seropositive for measles anti-
body, compared with 97.5% (95% CI, 96.1%­98.5%) (P  .01)
of US-born Mexican Americans. The seroprevalence of measles
antibody was significantly higher in participants who had health
insurance (96.4% [95% CI, 95.6%­97.1%]) than in those did
not have it (93.8% [95% CI, 92.2%­95.2%]) (P  .01); this dif-
ference was statistically significant in 2 birth cohorts, 1967­1976
and 1977­1986 (P  .05). Service in the military was also sig-
nificantly associated with increased measles seropositivity, both
in the study population overall (P  .05) and in the 1967­1976
birth cohort (P  .01).
A logistic regression analysis was performed to consider inde-
pendent predictors of the seroprevalence of measles antibody in
participants in the 1967­1976 birth cohort, because this group
had the lowest seroprevalence. After adjustment for all other
significant cofactors, non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity was still
the strongest predictor of the presence of measles antibody (odds
ratio, 5.9 [95% CI, 2.7­12.8]), followed by foreign birth (table
2). Educational and health-insurance status also remained as
positive predictors in the model.
DISCUSSION
In the present study's representative sample of the US popula-
tion 6­49 years of age, the overall seroprevalence of measles IgG
antibody was 95.9% during 1999­2004. When the sample was
examined in terms of race/ethnicity and birth cohort, measles
seropositivity was at or above the estimated threshold of 93%­
95% that is needed for elimination of measles, in all birth cohorts
except that of 1967­1976 [8]. The lower seroprevalence in this
latter birth cohort is consistent with previous findings by
NHANES III [7] and other previous and smaller studies [15­17],
and the most likely reasons for it are (1) the lower vaccination
coverage of children before the widespread implementation of
school immunization requirements and (2) a decrease in vaccine
availability during 1969­1971, a period when federal funding for
vaccine purchase was suspended [18]. Although any population
that has measles-seronegative individuals regardless of history of
immunization can experience an outbreak [19] and lower im-
munity levels may be sufficient in less dense populations [20],
this birth cohort represents a population with an increased num-
ber of measles-seronegative individuals who might be at in-

creased risk for disease. Higher education, which is an indicator
of socioeconomic status, and health insurance were predictors of
seropositivity for measles antibody in this birth cohort, even af-
ter adjustment for race/ethnicity, and other studies [21, 22] have
found these variables to be associated with higher vaccination
coverage.
In all birth cohorts, the seroprevalence of measles antibody
was significantly higher in non-Hispanic blacks than that in
non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans, difference that
remained regardless of the vaccination era and that probably
represents natural infection during the era before the federal
measles-elimination program and the early implementation of
the measles-vaccination program. The measles epidemic during
1989­1991 produced 55,000 cases, with a 4­7-fold-higher in-
cidence in nonwhite children [24]. Because participants were
not asked whether they had ever had measles, the present study's
data cannot be used to assess the reason for this significantly
higher seropositivity for measles in non-Hispanic blacks.
Routine vaccination for measles began in Mexico in 1973
[23]. In the present study, foreign-born Mexican Americans
who were born after that year (i.e., 1977 or later) had lower
seropositivity for measles antibody than did US-born Mexican
Americans. This difference may be due to lower vaccination
rates in the foreign-born population and reduced circulation of
measles in Mexico, as a result of the initiation of the vaccination
program.
In 1994, the Vaccines for Children Program, a national initia-
tive that entitled uninsured or underinsured children to free vac-
cine, was launched [25]. This initiative, along with the change to
the 2-dose measles-vaccination schedule [26] and the increas-
ingly successful school immunization laws [27], coincides with
the consistently high levels of seroprevalence of measles anti-
body, in all race/ethnic groups, that were achieved during the
mid 1990s.
The present study has several limitations. Previous studies
comparing commercially available EIA assay versus the gold-
standard plaque reduction­neutralization assay have demon-
strated that EIA was less sensitive but is a reliable identifier of
measles-seronegative individuals. [28, 29]. Also, the assay used

in the present study was not directly comparable to the method
used in NHANES III [7], so the seroprevalences of measles an-
tibody in the 2 surveys could not be directly compared. Partici-
pants in the present study were not asked whether they had ever
had measles, and MCV vaccination status was not recorded;
therefore, the relationship between changes in the seropreva-
lence of measles antibody and vaccinations programs is specula-
tive. In addition, the data regarding a participant's socioeco-
nomic status, used to predict current serostatus for measles in
the present study, may not correctly reflect that participant's
socioeconomic status at the likely time of vaccination.
Data from NHANES 1999­2004 demonstrate that the sero-
prevalence of measles antibody in the United States was high--
and, in all population subgroups except the 1967­1976 birth
cohort, adequate to ensure that the elimination of endemic mea-
sles can be maintained. These data are consistent with other ep-
idemiologic and vaccination-coverage data. Nonetheless, mea-
sles remains endemic in most of the world; therefore, the risk of
reintroduction of the virus into the United States is high [29].
Maintenance of high levels of vaccine-induced measles anti-
body, via consistent implementation of the recommendations of
the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, can ensure
that the elimination of measles in the United States is main-
tained.
