Abstract
Objective: To identify risk factors for preoperative respiratory complications associated with
tracheobronchial foreign body aspiration (TFBA) by retrospectively analysing paediatric cases
presenting with or without complications.
Methods: Paediatric patients who presented with TFBA and were admitted to hospital were
enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into two groups based on occurrence of preoperative
respiratory complications as confirmed by computed tomography. Age, sex, TFBA symptoms, type
of foreign body, retention timeand location of the foreign body were documented and compared
between the groups.
Results: In total, 223 children were included: group A (n ¼ 161) included those with respiratory
complications; group B (n ¼ 62) included those without respiratory complications. Univariate and
multivariate analyses found that type of foreign body, and symptoms differed significantly between
the two groups.
Conclusion: Respiratory complications of TFBA in children were correlated with the type of
foreign body and symptoms.

can become life threatening under severe
circumstances.1 Delayed diagnoses are fre-
quent and substantially increase the risk of
respiratory complications.2 Respiratory
complications of TFBA, including pulmon-
ary infection (pneumonia), emphysema,
atelectasis, mediastinal shift and pneumo-
mediastinum, not only add difficulties to the
bronchoscopy procedure but also contribute
to long-term adverse consequences and
harmful effects on children's health.3­5
Research has reported a positive correl-
ation between respiratory complications
and the retention time of foreign bodies,2
but factors that influence the retention time
have not been identified. The present study
aimed to identify the risk factors for pre-
operative respiratory complications by
retrospectively analysing cases of paediatric
TFBA in order to compare age, sex, symp-
toms, type of foreign body, retention time
and location of foreign body between
groups with or without preoperative respira-
tory complications.
Patients and methods
Patient population
This retrospective study analysed data col-
lected from consecutive paediatric patients
with TFBA who attended the Department
of Otolaryngology, Ningbo Women and
Children's Hospital, Ningbo, Zhejiang
Province, China, between February 2012
and October 2014. All TFBAs were diag-
nosed by rigid bronchoscopy based on a
definitive history or suspicion of foreign
body inhalation. Computed tomography
(CT) was performed in all patients using a
Brilliance CT 16-slice system (Philips
Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) to iden-
tify any pulmonary complications.
The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Ningbo Women and
Children's Hospital (no. 2015012). Parents or
legal guardians of the study participants
provided written informed consent.
Study methods
Enrolled patients were divided into two groups
according to occurrence of preoperative
respiratory complications (pulmonary infec-
tion [pneumonia], emphysema, atelectasis,
mediastinal shift and pneumomediastinum)
confirmed by CT. Group A included patients
with preoperative respiratory complications;
group B included patients without preopera-
tive respiratory complications. Retention time,
which was defined as the duration from onset
of TFBA symptoms to hospital admission,
was recorded for all study participants.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 16.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for WindowsÕ.
Continuous data with a normal distribution
were presented as meanÆ SD. Between-group
comparisons were conducted using Student's
t-test. Categorical data were analysed using
2-test. All of the variables were assessed for
normality using Kolmogorov­Smirnov test.
A P-value< 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Univariate and multivariate ana-
lyses were performed using a Cox logistic
regression model. Effects of different clinical
parameters on the respiratory complications of
TFBA in children were calculated by univari-
ate analysis for each parameter. Parameters for
which the unadjusted P-value was< 0.10 in the
univariate analysis were identified as potential
risk markers and were included in the multi-
variate analysis.
Results
A total of 223 children were enrolled in
the study (150 male; 73 female, with a
mean Æ SD age of 1.8 Æ 1.9 years [range,
7 months to 12 years]). The mean Æ SD
retention time was 5.9 Æ 1.5 days (range,
30 min to 63 days). In total, 156 of 223
patients (70%) were referred from other
hospitals in the local area.

Patients were divided into two groups
based on the presence of preoperative
respiratory complications as identified on
CT: group A (n ¼ 161; 106 male and 55
female patients) and group B (n ¼ 62; 43
male and 19 female patients). Table 1
presents the demographic and clinical char-
acteristics of the two groups. There were
no significant between-group differences in
terms of age or sex distribution. Age- and
sex distributions of the patients in both
groups A and B are presented in Figure 1.
In group A, the age groups that were most
likely to present with TFBA were the 0 to
<1 (n ¼ 40 patients) and !1 to <2
(n ¼ 100) year groups. In group B, the
age groups that were most likely to present
with TFBA were 0 to <1 (n ¼ 15 patients)
and !1 to <2 (n ¼ 36) year groups, which
together accounted for 86% (191/223) of
all patients.
The mean Æ SD retention time was sig-
nificantly longer in group A compared with
group B (P < 0.05) (Table 1).
Coughing and wheezing were the most
common symptoms of TFBA in patients in
both groups (Table 2). The proportion of
patients with dyspnoea in group B was
significantly higher compared with group
A (P < 0.05). There were no other significant
between-group differences.
Types of foreign body that were aspirated
by patients in both study groups are listed in
Table 3. The majority of aspirated foreign
bodies were food items (145/161 [90%] in
group A; 55/62 [89%] in group B), particu-
larly peanut kernels and sunflower seeds.
Anatomical locations of aspirated foreign
bodies for both groups are shown in Table 4.
Results of the CT scans for preoperative
pulmonary complications for group A are
shown in Table 5. Emphysema and pneu-
monia were the most common complica-
tions. A total of 121 of 161 patients (75%)
in group A had several complications
simultaneously.
Univariate and multivariate analyses of
the effects of clinical parameters on respira-
tory complications of TFBA in children
found that the type of foreign body and
the symptoms of TFBA differed significantly
between both groups (P < 0.05) (Table 6).
Discussion
Despite improvements in the general pub-
lic's knowledge of TFBA in recent years, this
pulmonary condition remains life threaten-
ing for young children who cannot chew
food thoroughly and tend to put foreign
bodies into their mouths. Previous reports
have demonstrated that children aged 0­3
years are most likely to experience TFBA,
accounting for 65­75% of all cases.4,6 In the
current study, 86% (191/223) of the cases
were children aged 0 to <2 years and the
mean age of the study population was 1.8
years. The mean age was 1 year younger

than in previous reports.6­8 Reasons for this
decrease in the mean age of children experien-
cing TFBA are speculated to be an improved
material life and increased availability of food
at home. Some nutritionists recommend nuts
to promote brain development in young chil-
dren, prompting parents to add these food-
stuffs to their children's diets. There was no

significant difference in the mean age of
groups A and group B (1.8 versus 1.9 years,
respectively) in the present study.
In the present study, the male/female
ratios in groups A and B were 1.9:1.0 and
2.3:1.0, respectively, which were similar to
previously reported ratios.9 There is some
evidence that male children may be more
adventurous and careless than female chil-
dren, which may heighten the risk of TFBA
in male infants.9
Tracheobronchial foreign body aspiration
is frequently misdiagnosed in children for the
following reasons: (i) parents are absent when
TFBA occurs and cannot provide a clear
history; (ii) due to concern over being
blamed, babysitting seniors may refuse to
accurately report an incident; (iii) lack of

medical knowledge, which leads to neglect of
the serious situation and delay in seeing a
physician; (iv) clinicians misdiagnose TFBA as
upper respiratory infection, bronchitis or pneu-
monia.2,3 In the present study, the meanÆ SD
retention time was significantly longer in group
A compared with group B (13.40Æ 1.62days
[range, 3h to 63days] versus 4.02Æ 5.62days
[range, 0.5h to 15days], respectively)
(P< 0.05). Delayed treatment prolongs the
retention time of the foreign body in the
respiratory tract, resulting in pneumonia,
emphysema, atelectasis, pneumomediastinum
and other serious complications.2,3
Common symptoms of TFBA are cough-
ing, dyspnoea, wheezing, and fever, which
differ according to the stage of TFBA; these
symptoms are generally experienced in a
sequential manner.1,2 In the first stage
(acute stage), the most common symptoms
are violent coughing, dyspnoea, or even
asphyxia due to complete airway blockage.1,2
In the second stage (quiescent stage), the
symptoms are not obvious, which can lead to
misdiagnosis.1,2 The third stage is a late stage
accompanied by complications.1,2 In the
present study, the most common symptoms
of TFBA in patients in both groups were
coughing and wheezing. Other symptoms
included fever and dyspnoea. The proportion
of patients with dyspnoea in group B was
significantly higher compared with group A
(P < 0.05) in the present study, a finding that
might be attributed to the location of foreign
bodies. Patients in group B were more likely
to have their foreign body located in their
trachea compared with group A (51.6%
versus 2.5%, respectively), which in our
experience cause severe symptoms such as
dyspnoea, attracting more attention and
causing patients and their parents to seek
urgent medical help, thus facilitating early
diagnosis and timely treatment.
Preoperative respiratory complications
are related to the retention time of the foreign
body.3 In our experience, plant foreign
bodies such as peanuts and walnuts can
cause complications if they are retained for
>24h, while plastic foreign bodies require a
longer period, several months or even years,
to trigger complications. The type, size, shape
and location of the foreign body also plays a
role in the occurrence of preoperative respira-
tory complications.3 The type of foreign body
is related to the local culture and diet-
ary habits.3,10,11 Most studies have shown
that nuts (particularly peanuts) and seeds
(especially sunflower seeds) are most

commonly aspirated.3,12,13 In the present
study, $90% of the aspirated foreign bodies
in both groups were food, particularly peanut
kernels (group A: 32.3%; group B: 16.1%)
and sunflower seeds (group A: 13.7%; group
B: 43.5%). Peanut kernels are larger than
sunflower seeds, so they are prone to cause
airway blockage. After prolonged retention
in the respiratory tract, during which time
water is absorbed, the peanut can expand and
worsen the condition.3 In addition, peanuts
are abundant in unsaturated fatty acids,
contributing to respiratory inflammation.3
These facts might explain the higher propor-
tion of aspirated peanuts in group A com-
pared with group B, in the present study. The
majority of TFBA cases could be avoided by
parents and carers keeping young children
away from nuts and small toys.
In the long term, foreign bodies have a
higher tendency to fall into the right bron-
chus.12 Recent research has shown that the
right-side tendency exists in adults but not in
children younger than 15 years.14 The left and
right principal bronchi form similar angles
within the main trachea,13 thus the likelihood
of a foreign body falling into each should be
similar.14,15 This present study supports this
suggestion, as 50.9% of foreign bodies in
group A were located in the left bronchus
and 46.6%% were in the right bronchus; in
group B, 27.4% of foreign bodies were located
in the left bronchus and 21.0% were in the
right bronchus. Of special interest was the fact
that in group B, 51.6% of the foreign bodies
were located in the trachea, which was mark-
edly higher than in group A (2.5%). These
findings suggest that the symptoms associated
with the presence of a foreign body in the
trachea were more severe than in the bronchus,
causing patients and their parents to seek
medical help earlier.
When patients present with TFBA at our
institution, CT is routinely used to ascertain
the location of the foreign body and confirm
preoperative complications, because severe
complications must be detected in order to
provide timely treatment and reduce surgical
risks. All 223 patients in the present study
underwent CT and 161 patients (group A)
were confirmed to have preoperative respira-
tory complications. Emphysema and pneumo-
nia were the most common complications,
accounting for 96.9% and 45.3% of all cases,
respectively. Less common complications
included atelectasis, pneumomediastinum,
pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema.
The present study had a number of limita-
tions. First, there was no sample-size calcula-
tion undertaken prior to commencement of
the study and the authors randomly chose the
number of patients to include. Secondly,
analyses were not undertaken according to
the different age groups. Thirdly, the study did
not present the results of treatment and
different treatment modalities. Finally, the
imbalance between male and female partici-
pants might have had an impact on the results.
In conclusion, respiratory complications
of TFBA in children are correlated with type
of foreign body, retention time and symp-
toms, but showed no relationship with
location of the foreign body, age or sex.
Aspiration of peanuts and prolonged reten-
tion time may cause preoperative complica-
tions. Dyspnoea and trachea-located foreign
bodies appeared to urge the patient and their
parents to seek medical help earlier, thus
reducing preoperative respiratory complica-
tions. Early diagnosis and treatment are
considered to be key factors in improving
the clinical response to TFBA, and in
reducing the incidence of complications
associated with TFBA in children.
