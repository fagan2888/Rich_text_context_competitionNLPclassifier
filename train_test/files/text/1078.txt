Objectives. In this study, we examined whether racial segregation is associated with poorer self-rated health among
older adults, and whether racial segregation helps explain race disparities in self-rated health between Black and White
older adults.
Methods. We used multilevel data at the individual, neighborhood (tract), and county levels, from two national
surveys--the Americans' Changing Lives (ACL) survey and the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH).
We used hierarchical linear models in order to regress self-rated health on county-, neighborhood-, and individual-level
racial and socioeconomic variables.
Results. In the NSFH, there was an association between county racial segregation and poorer self-rated health among
White but not Black older adults (net of county percent Black and percent poverty). In the ACL, there was no statistically
significant association between racial segregation and self-rated health. In the NSFH, there was some indication that
Black older adults had better self-rated health when living in neighborhoods with a higher percentage of Black residents
than the county percentage.
Discussion. Although aggregate-level studies demonstrate associations between racial segregation and mortality rates,
our multilevel analyses with two national data sets suggest only weak associations between racial segregation and self-
rated health. However, socioeconomic status at multiple levels contributes to race disparities in health.
BLACK older adults generally have worse health than do
White older adults (Bulatao & Anderson, 2004), and this
disparity is often only partly mediated by individual socioeco-
nomic status (SES; Clark & Maddox, 1992; Crimmins,
Hayward, & Seeman, 2004; LeClere, Rogers, & Peters, 1998;
Robert & Lee, 2002). Multilevel research on neighborhood
context and health has demonstrated that the average lower
socioeconomic neighborhood context of Black older adults con-
tributes further to race disparities in health (Cagney, Brown-
ing, & Wen, 2005; Robert & Lee). Although there is a growing
body of literature that examines the association between
neighborhood or community context and health among older
adults (Balfour & Kaplan, 2002; Cagney et al.; Krause, 1996;
Robert & Lee; Robert & Li, 2001; Wen, Cagney, & Christakis,
2005), most of this research focuses on the socioeconomic
rather than the racial context of neighborhoods. Moreover,
although racial residential segregation in the United States is
considerable and enduring (Fischer, 2003; Massey & Denton,
1993), we found no multilevel research that has explicitly
investigated the role of racial residential segregation as a factor
that might help explain race disparities in health among older
adults. The purpose of this study was to examine whether racial
residential segregation was associated with poorer self-rated
health among older adults in the United States, and whether
racial residential segregation helped explain race disparities in
self-rated health between Black and White older adults.
Racial residential segregation (hereafter ``racial segrega-
tion'') refers to the differential distribution of individuals of
different races across smaller residential units (e.g., census
tracts) within a larger geographical unit (e.g., a city, county, or
metropolitan area; Massey & Denton, 1988b). Research has
shown that racial segregation produces and reinforces the
economic segregation of Black people in the United States
(Jargowsky, 1997; Massey, 1990; Massey & Denton, 1988a;
Wilson, 1987). As a result of racial segregation, Black people
and White people live in very different community contexts.
For example, not only are Black people more likely than White
people to live in lower socioeconomic communities, but Black
people are more likely than White people of the same income
level to live in lower socioeconomic communities (Jargowsky).
Research has demonstrated that various measures of racial
segregation are associated with high rates of poverty, crime,
homicide, dropping out of high school, and unemployment, as
well as with lower rates of community participation (Peterson
& Krivo, 1993; Shihadeh & Flynn, 1996; Wilson, 1987). All
of these neighborhood factors are associated with health.
However, few researchers have explicitly examined whether
living in racially segregated neighborhoods is associated with
poorer health.
Researchers theorize that racial segregation affects health
through two general pathways (Acevedo-Garcia, Lochner,
Osypuk, & Subramanian, 2003; Collins & Williams, 1999;
LaVeist, 1989, 1993; Polednak, 1993, 1996; Schulz, Williams,
Israel, & Lempert, 2002). First, racial segregation can reinforce
racial differences in opportunity structures and access to re-
sources that more proximately affect health (structural path-
ways),affectingtheeducation,occupation,economic,andservice
opportunities in neighborhoods and for individuals. Among
the current cohort(s) of older adults who have experienced
a lifetime of exposure to racial residential segregation, these
structural pathways may have both a cumulative effect across
the life course, and a contemporaneous effect (e.g., quality of

2006, Vol. 61B, No. 4, S203­S211
S203
and access to health, social, and transportation services,
accessible and high quality markets, safe places to walk).
Second, racial segregation may create an environment that
heightens exposure to and perceptions of discrimination,
which can affect stress and other psychosocial factors that
are more proximal determinants of health (interpersonal path-
ways). In addition, causation can work the other way, such
that people in poorer health may be more likely to move into
(or, more plausibly, less likely to move out of) highly
segregated neighborhoods. Regardless of causality, both
scenarios suggest an aggregate association between racial
segregation and health.
Research using aggregate-level data shows that metropolitan
areas with higher racial segregation have higher adult and infant
mortality rates (Bird, 1995; Collins & Williams, 1999; Guest,
Almgren, & Hussey, 1998; LaVeist, 1989, 1993; Polednak,
1993, 1996; Shihadeh & Flynn, 1996). To date, researchers
have primarily examined mortality rates, but not other measures
of health; investigators have not examined age-specific trends
among adults. Moreover, multilevel studies are necessary in
order to extend beyond aggregate-level findings (Acevedo-
Garcia et al., 2003). For example, multilevel studies can
examine whether the relationship between racial segregation
and health (a) exists for both Black and White residents and for
residents with other specific characteristics (e.g., age, SES); (b)
operates through specific neighborhood and individual path-
ways; and (c) exists net of neighborhood and individual
socioeconomic and other factors.
One recent study conducted a multilevel analysis with data
at both the individual and metropolitan statistical area (MSA)
levels. Subramanian, Acevedo-Garcia, and Osypuk (2005)
examined racial segregation and self-rated health by using the
March 2000 supplement of the Current Population Survey,
which included a sample of more than 50,000 non-Hispanic
White and Black adults residing in MSAs throughout the
United States. Despite this large, comprehensive sample, they
found only a weak association between racial segregation at
the MSA level and poor self-rated health, net of age, gender,
marital status, education, income, and race. Subramanian and
colleagues examined two measures of racial segregation at the
MSA level that are the most commonly used in the racial
segregation literature (Acevedo-Garcia et al., 2003): the
Dissimilarity Index and the Isolation Index. The Dissimilarity
Index measures residential unevenness between two groups,
and the Isolation Index measures the probability that a minority
group member will come into contact with a majority group
member. They found no statistically significant relationship
between the Dissimilarity Index and health, or between White
isolation and health. They did find a statistically significant
association between high Black isolation and poor health
among Black residents, but the magnitude was very small.
These multilevel analyses suggest a weaker association
between racial segregation and self-rated health than had been
suggested by previous aggregate-level analyses.
Replication of such multilevel analyses is necessary.
Moreover, as Subramanian and colleagues (2005) suggested,
future studies should examine multilevel data not only at the
metropolitan and individual level, but at the intermediary
neighborhood level as well. Although living in a metropolitan
area with greater racial segregation might be associated with
poorer health, it is unclear whether that relationship is similar
across the neighborhoods within the metropolitan area. It is
likely that among people living in a highly segregated
metropolitan area, living in a neighborhood with a high
percentage of Black residents is a different experience than
living in a neighborhood with few Black residents. Yet without
neighborhood-level data, models assume that the average health
effects of living in a more highly segregated MSA are the same
across all residents in all neighborhoods in a particular MSA.
Our study rectifies these issues by using multilevel data at the
individual, neighborhood, and county level, from two national
surveys of adults in the United States, in order to examine the
association between racial segregation and self-rated health
among Black and White older adults. We examined whether
racial segregation at the county level was associated with self-
rated health for both Black and White older adults, net of
county poverty, racial composition, and individual SES.
Moreover, we extend research in this area by having examined
whether the racial composition of one's neighborhood, when
compared with the racial composition of the county, is
associated with self-rated health. We also tested whether the
Black disadvantage in self-rated health was partly explained
by neighborhood- and county-level racial segregation, racial
composition, and poverty.
Our three primary hypotheses were:
H1: Living in counties with greater racial residential segrega-
tion is associated with lower self-rated health for both
Black and White older adults.
H2: The greater the percentage of Black residents in
one's neighborhood, in comparison to the percentage of
Black residents in one's county, the worse health one is
likely to report.
H3: The Black disadvantage in self-rated health is partly ex-
plained by neighborhood- and county-level racial segre-
gation, racial composition, and poverty status.
METHODS
We used two nationally representative samples of adults.
Individual-level data came from the first waves of two U.S.
surveys: the Americans' Changing Lives (ACL) 1986 survey
(House, 1989) and the National Survey of Families and
Households (NSFH) 1987­1988 survey (Sweet, Bumpass, &
Call, 1988). Based on respondents' addresses at Wave 1, we
merged characteristics of their census tracts and counties from
a 1990 census extract data file (Adams, 1992).
ACL Data
Researchers conducted Wave 1 of the ACL in 1986 through
face-to-face surveys with 3,617 adults (House, 1989) from
a multistage, stratified area probability sample of noninstitu-
tionalized adults aged 25 and older. Black people and people
aged 60 and older were oversampled. The household response
rate was 70%. We restricted this sample to respondents aged 60
and older, eliminated 24 respondents whose self-rated race was
neither Black nor White, excluded rural counties, and
eliminated 7 urban and suburban counties with missing data
on racial segregation, resulting in a final sample of 1,095
respondents (382 Black, 713 White) in 102 urban and sub-
urban counties.

NSFH Data
Investigators conducted Wave 1 of the NSFH in 1987­1988
through face-to-face interviews with 13,007 adults (Sweet,
Bumpass, & Call, 1988) from a multistage, area probability
sample of noninstitutionalized adults aged 19 and older. Black
people, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, single parents,
stepparents, cohabitors, and recently married persons were
oversampled. The Wave 1 response rate was 74%. We
restricted this sample to respondents aged 60 and older,
eliminated 126 respondents whose self-rated race was neither
Black nor White, excluded rural counties, and removed
respondents with missing data on age, race, education, self-
rated health, and county-level racial segregation, resulting in
a final sample of 1,615 residents aged 60 or older (290 Black,
1,325 White) residing in 204 urban and suburban counties.
Individual-Level Variables
Self reported health, our dependent variable, is a multidi-
mensional and subjective measure of health that has been
shown to reliably predict mortality and morbidity after
controlling for health risk factors (Idler & Benyamini, 1997;
Idler & Kasl, 1995). Although Blacks and Whites and the old-
old and young-old report their health differently, research has
shown that self-rated health predicts mortality for these groups
(Ferraro, 1980; Ferraro & Kelly-Moore, 2001). Investigators for
both the NSFH and ACL asked about self-rated health, using
slightly different wording and response choices. ACL respon-
dents were asked: ``How would you rate your health at the
present time?'' Response categories were: excellent, very good,
good, fair, or poor. NSFH respondents were asked: ``Compared
with other people your age, how would you describe your
health?'' Response categories were: excellent, good, fair, poor,
or very poor. In order to make items more comparable, we
recoded them into four categories for each data set. We coded
NSFH self-rated health reports as 1 ¼ excellent, 2 ¼ good, 3 ¼
fair, and 4¼poor or very poor. We coded ACL self-rated health
reports as 1 ¼ excellent, 2 ¼ very good or good, 3 ¼ fair, and
4 ¼ poor.
We included age (years) and gender as controls in all
analyses. We coded education in years of education. We used
family income for ACL respondents and household income for
NSFH respondents. Annual income is a categorical variable:
high income ¼ $20,000 or more, medium income ¼ $10,000 to
$20,000, and low income ¼ less than $10,000. For the NSFH,
we included a missing income dummy; missing data for the
ACL had previously been imputed via a regression prediction
equation (House, 1989). We coded financial assets as a dummy
variable comparing individuals with $10,000 or more, those
with less than $10,000 (reference category), and those with
missing assets data. For analyses, we centered continuous
variables at their grand means.
County-Level Variables
We included three county-level variables: racial segregation,
racial composition, and percent poverty. Massey and Denton
(1988b) classified racial segregation indices into five dimen-
sions: evenness, exposure, concentration, centralization, and
clustering. Much of the research on racial segregation in the
past two decades, particularly that focusing on health, has used
either the Dissimilarity Index (to measure evenness) or the
Isolation Index (to measure exposure). We initially used both
the Dissimilarity Index and the Isolation Index, though we
present here just the results for the Dissimilarity Index because
the results were similar with both measures. The Dissimilarity
Index measures the level of residential unevenness between two
groups (James & Taeuber, 1985). It indicates the proportion of
Blacks that would have to move to a White-dominated census
tract in order for the races to be evenly distributed through-
out the county. A higher value indicates higher levels of
segregation. In preliminary analyses, the Dissimilarity Index
had a nonlinear association with self-rated health that varied
between data sets. Therefore, we coded the Dissimilarity Index
in quartiles in order to capture nonlinearities. We compared the
25% of people in the most segregated counties (the omitted
quartile with the highest dissimilarity scores) with those people
in each of the less segregated quartiles. For race-specific
analyses, we used race-specific dissimilarity quartiles in order
to examine the association between residential segregation and
self-rated health among Black or among White older adults.
We also included the percentage of Black people in a county
(% Black) as a measure of racial composition. Percent Black
is itself not a measure of racial segregation because counties
with the same percentage of Black residents may have those
residents distributed very differently across the county.
Counties with relatively few Black people may be very
segregated just as counties with many Black people may be
very segregated. Though not a measure of racial segregation per
se, racial composition of counties is a measure of racial context
in its own right (Massey, Condran & Denton, 1987) that may be
related to health. Regardless of segregation, communities with
higher percent Black may have overall worse average health.
Finally, we also included a continuous, centered, indicator of
percentage of households in poverty in the county.
Tract-Level Variables
We included two tract-level variables: percentage of house-
holds in poverty (percent poverty) and neighborhood racial
difference. Whereas the county-level dissimilarity measure
indicates whether a person lives in a county with overall higher
or lower segregation, it does not indicate where in that county
a person lives (e.g., in a neighborhood with a high, average, or
low percentage of Black residents). It is likely that living in
a more segregated county does not affect everyone equally.
Living in a county with high racial segregation might be more
detrimental to those living in a neighborhood with a higher
percentage of Black residents. We calculated neighborhood
racial difference by subtracting the percent Black in one's
county from the percent Black in one's tract. Respondents with
a score greater than 0 live in a neighborhood with a greater
percentage of Black people than the overall percentage in the
county, and those with a negative score live in a neighborhood
with a lower percentage of Black people than the overall
percentage in the county. (We did not center this variable as we
had with other continuous variables.) The greater the score, the
greater the Black racial concentration of one's neighborhood in
comparison with the county. Our research contributes signifi-
cantly to the literature by computing neighborhood racial
difference in order to test whether the gap between racial

composition at the neighborhood and county levels is as-
sociated with self-rated health.
Statistical Analyses
We weighted the data in order to correct for sample selection
probabilities and nonresponse, which resulted in weighted
samples that approximated the distribution of the demographic
composition of the U.S. adult population during the first wave
of interviews. We centered weights to the size of the sample for
each race subsample. Because of the multilevel nature of our
questions, as well as the clustering of individuals within
counties and communities, we used SAS PROC MIXED in
order to conduct iterative maximum likelihood estimation
regression analyses (SAS Institute, 1996). We present fixed
effect coefficients for independent variables at the individual
and county, or individual and neighborhood (tract) levels while
adjusting for random intercepts between counties or neighbor-
hoods (Snijders & Bosker, 1999).
RESULTS
Tables 1 and 2 present descriptive statistics for the NSFH
and the ACL, respectively, showing distributions for the full
sample, Black sample, and White sample.
Tables 3 and 4 present data from the test of our first
hypothesis, namely that living in counties with greater racial
residential segregation is associated with lower self-rated health
for both Black and White older adults. In Table 3, Model 1
demonstrates that among older adults in the NSFH, respondents
living in counties with the greatest dissimilarity (4th quartile,
omitted here) had worse self-rated health than respondents
living in counties categorized in the 2nd and 3rd quartiles of the
Dissimilarity Index, controlling only for individual age and
gender. For example, people living in a county with
a Dissimilarity Index in the 3rd quartile had a self-rated health
score .167 units better than those living in the most racially
segregated counties (Dissimilarity Index in the 4th quartile).
Model 2 demonstrates that once the county-level percent Black
was added to the model, there was no longer a statistically
significant association between racial segregation and self-rated
health. This suggests that it is not necessarily county racial
segregation that is associated with health, but rather higher
Black population composition, regardless of the racial residen-
tial distribution within the county. However, adding respond-
ents' race into Model 3 eliminated the statistically significant
association between county-level percent Black and self-rated
health. Black older adults had worse self-rated health than
White older adults, regardless of the racial segregation or
composition of the county, but racial segregation and
composition no longer had independent associations with
self-rated health. Model 4 adds county-level percent poverty
and demonstrates that people living in counties with greater
poverty had worse health, even net of race, age, gender, racial
segregation, and racial composition. Note that county-level
poverty only slightly reduced race differences in self-rated
health. In Model 5, adding individual-level SES variables
(income, education, and assets) eliminated the association
between county-level poverty and self-rated health.

The results for the ACL are somewhat different than those
for the NSFH. Table 4, Model 1 shows no statistically
significant association between racial segregation and self-rated
health. Model 2 shows no association between racial compo-
sition and self-rated health. Model 3 demonstrates that there
was no statistically significant racial disparity in self-rated
health. However, as with the NSFH, Model 4 shows that
a greater county-level percent poverty was associated with
worse self-rated health. In contrast to the results for the NSFH,
this association remained statistically significant after control-
ling for individual-level SES in Model 5.
As a whole, results from Tables 3 and 4 provided little
support for the hypothesis that racial segregation is associated
with self-rated health among older adults in the United States,
regardless of race. In preliminary analyses (not shown), we also
examined MSA-level (instead of county-level) Dissimilarity
Index in the ACL sample and found that there was no
association between the MSA-level Dissimilarity Index and
self-rated health. However, Tables 5 and 6 now describe race-
specific models. Table 5 indicates that the slight association
between racial segregation and health noted earlier was found
only among White older adults. Model 1 shows that White older
adults living in counties with the most racial segregation (4th
quartile of Dissimilarity Index) had a self-rated health score .167
units worse than that of people in the 3rd quartile on the
Dissimilarity Index, net of county-level percent Black, percent
poverty, and individual age and gender. This association was
reduced and was no longer statistically significant after we
included individual SES controls in Model 2.
Among Black older adults, Model 3 demonstrates that only
county poverty was associated with self-rated health. After
controlling for individual SES, county poverty was still
associated with worse self-rated health. An interesting finding
is that county percent Black emerged as a statistically
significant predictor, but in an unexpected direction. After
controlling for individual SES, county poverty, and racial
segregation, Black older adults living in counties with a higher
percentage of Black residents had better self-rated health than
those in counties with fewer Black residents. All else being
equal, living in a county with a greater percent Black may be
associated with poor health among White older adults, but
better health among Black older adults.
Table 6 for the ACL demonstrates little new findings with
the race-specific analyses. Neither racial segregation nor racial
composition was associated with self-rated health for either
White or Black older adults. In sum, we found little support for
an association between racial segregation and self-rated health
among older adults. The support we did find suggests that
living in more segregated counties was associated with worse
health for White older adults, whereas living in counties with
a higher percent Black was associated with better health for
Black older adults.
Our second hypothesis stated that the greater the percentage
of Black residents in one's neighborhood, in comparison to the
percentage of Black residents in one's county, the worse health
one is likely to have. This hypothesis reflects our ability to use
multilevel information to extend existing research by exam-
ining whether living in a segregated neighborhood per se,

RACIAL SEGREGATION AND HEALTH DISPARITIES S207
rather than living in a county with high overall segregation, is
associated with poorer health. Tables 7 and 8 show individual-
and neighborhood-level (census tract) data, in contrast to the
previous tables, which contained individual- and county-level
data. Model 1 of Table 7 demonstrates that in the NSFH, Black
older adults had worse self-rated health than did White older
adults, but there was no association between neighborhood
segregation (using the neighborhood racial difference variable)
and self-rated health. Model 2 adds neighborhood (tract-level)
percent poverty to the model and demonstrates that people
living in higher poverty neighborhoods had worse health.
Moreover, once we had controlled for percent poverty, there
was a statistically significant coefficient for neighborhood racial
difference. People living in neighborhoods with a greater
percent of Black neighbors relative to the county average had
better self-rated health. This association was no longer
statistically significant after controlling for individual SES in
Model 3. Further investigation showed that this relationship
existed only for Black older adults in the NSFH, as
demonstrated in Models 4­6.
These findings counter our second hypothesis, which is that
living in a more racially segregated neighborhood is associated
with worse health. However, neighborhood percent Black
and the neighborhood racial difference variable were highly
correlated, so we did not include them simultaneously. We
cautiously conclude that net of percent poverty, either higher
percent Black or neighborhood segregation is associated with
positive self-rated health for Black older adults.
In contrast, Table 8 shows that there was no association in
the ACL between neighborhood racial difference and self-rated
health for the full sample; additional analyses found this to be
true for the racial subsamples as well. However, neighborhood
percent poverty retained its association with self-rated health
among older adults, even net of individual SES.
Finally, we revisit Tables 3 and 4 in order to address our
third hypothesis, that the Black disadvantage in self-rated
health is partly explained by neighborhood- and county-level
racial segregation, racial composition, and poverty status.
Looking back at Table 3 for the NSFH, Models 3 and 4
demonstrate that Black older adults had worse self-rated health
than did White older adults, and this association remained after
controlling for county-level racial segregation, racial concen-
tration, and percent poverty. Similarly, Table 7 shows that for

after controlling for neighborhood poverty and racial segrega-
tion. However, in both the county- and neighborhood-level
models for the NSFH, the Black disadvantage in self-rated
health was no longer statistically significant after further
controlling for individual SES. In this urban and suburban
sample of older adults, neighborhood- and county-level racial
and poverty indicators explained little of the Black disadvan-
tage in self-rated health. Moreover, in the ACL, there were no

race differences in self-rated health net of individual-level,
neighborhood-level, or county-level variables (Tables 4).
DISCUSSION
By using multilevel data from two national studies of adults
in the United States, we found little evidence of an association
between racial segregation and self-rated health among older
adults. In the ACL, we found no association between racial
segregation and self-rated health at either the county or
neighborhood level among Black and White older adults. In
the NSFH, we found a small but statistically significant
association between higher racial segregation and poorer self-
rated health among White older adults. This association
remained net of county-level percent Black and percent
poverty, suggesting both that it is racial segregation and not
just racial composition or poverty that is associated with health
among these White older adults, and also that poverty does not
mediate this association. The association disappeared after
controlling further for individual SES, suggesting that (a) racial
segregation may impact individuals' SES attainment, which is
more proximally related to health; or (b) White older adults
with lower SES are more likely than their higher SES
counterparts both to move into or to not move out of more
highly segregated counties and to have poorer health.
We also found unexpected evidence in the NSFH that there
may be something about living in a more highly concentrated
Black neighborhood that is associated with better health for
Black older adults, once neighborhood poverty is controlled.
We cautiously report these results because we were unable to
determine whether it was living in a high percent Black
neighborhood, or living in a neighborhood with a higher
percent Black than the average neighborhood in the county, that
was associated with better health. It is also possible that unique
features of the NSFH sample are responsible for this finding,
or that response rates in these neighborhoods were selective
by health status. If future research replicates these findings,
it would be consistent with previous research regarding greater
mental health among residents of enclaves with a high
concentration of people sharing their race or ethnicity
(Halpern, 1993).
In the NSFH, we also demonstrated that race differences in
self-rated health were only slightly reduced after considering
neighborhood- and county-level racial and socioeconomic
factors, but were eliminated after controlling further for
individual SES.
We will discuss here four primary conclusions. First, there
was, at best, only weak evidence of an association between
racial segregation and self-rated health among Black and White
older adults, based on two nationally representative multilevel
studies. This is consistent with evidence from Subramanian
and colleagues (2005), who used a very large multilevel sam-
ple but who nevertheless found (a) no associations between the
Dissimilarity Index at the MSA level and self-rated health, and

(b) small but statistically significant associations between the
Black Isolation Index and self-rated health, but only among
Black adults (odds ratio predicting poor self-rated health for the
interaction between individual Black race and Black Isolation
Index was only 1.05 [95% confidence interval 1.00­1.12]).
This means it is less likely that our results are due simply to the
weaknesses of using two smaller national probability samples
to address this question.
However, our results reported average effects across the
country, and therefore our study may be masking stronger
associations between racial segregation and health in local
regions (such as Detroit; Schulz et al., 2002). Moreover, we
examined only self-rated health as an outcome in this study.
Future research should examine other measures of both
physical and mental health. In addition, gerontological theory
and research suggest that community context may be par-
ticularly salient to the subsequent outcomes of older adults who
have already experienced some decline in physical or mental
health (Lawton, 1998; Wen et al., 2005). Therefore, future
research should examine whether some subgroups are more
vulnerable to the health consequences of living in segregated
neighborhoods.
Our second conclusion is that race, racial segregation, racial
composition, and poverty are so intertwined over time and
space that it is difficult (even with multilevel data) to examine
them simultaneously in order to determine separate, over-
lapping, and causal relationships. This is particularly a problem
in national data sets that employ probability samples not
designed to take representative samples from each neighbor-
hood. These data include insufficient numbers of the rare
counterfactual people, such as the White people who live in
neighborhoods with a high percentage of Black residents (and
vice versa). Despite the weak associations between racial
segregation and self-rated health, and given potential data
limitations, we encourage further work on this topic in light of
the persisting racial segregation of U.S. neighborhoods (Massey
& Denton, 1993), particularly among those who are poor and
Black (Fischer, 2003).
Our third conclusion is that, despite the weak evidence for an
association between racial segregation and self-rated health, we
showed clearer evidence for associations between health and
SES at multiple levels, which confirms the results of previous
research (Balfour & Kaplan, 2002; Cagney et al., 2005; Krause,
1996; Robert & Lee, 2002; Robert & Li, 2001; Subramanian
et al., 2005; Wen et al., 2005). Moreover, our results showed
that SES at multiple levels contributes to race disparities in
health among Black and White older adults, a finding that
contributes to a small literature on this topic (Cagney et al.;
Robert & Lee). This is not surprising, as the greatest increases
in residential segregation according to income during the past
decades have occurred among African Americans and His-
panics (Jargowsky, 1997). Future research should examine the
mechanisms linking socioeconomic and other neighborhood
characteristics to health, with an aim toward understanding how
they contribute to race disparities in health.
Finally, in order to fully understand race differences in health
among older adults, researchers need to look beyond urban
environments. This study, like other studies on racial
segregation and health, excluded rural respondents because
racial residential segregation is typically investigated as an
urban and suburban phenomenon. Ironically, we noted greater
racial health disparities among older rural respondents than
among urban and suburban respondents in our preliminary

race disparities in health among older adults requires examin-
ing the large disparities that exist within rural areas rather
than focusing only on race disparities within urban and sub-
urban areas.
