Abstract
Ability to predict discharge destination would be a useful way of optimizing posthospital care. We conducted a cross-
sectional, multiple state study of inpatient services to assess the likelihood of home discharges in 2009 among Medicaid
enrollees who were discharged following general hospitalizations. Analyses were conducted using hospitalization data from
the states of California, Georgia, Michigan, and Mississippi. A total of 33
160 patients were included in the study among
which 13948 (42%) were discharged to their own homes and 19212 (58%) were discharged to continue with institutional-
based treatment. A multiple logistic regression model showed that gender, age, race, and having ambulatory care-sensitive
conditions upon admission were significant predictors of home-based discharges. Females were at higher odds of home
discharges in the sample (odds ratio [OR] = 1.631; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.520-1.751), while patients with ambulatory
care-sensitive conditions were less likely to get home discharges (OR = 0.739; 95% CI, 0.684-0.798). As the nation engages in
the continued effort to improve the effectiveness of the health care system, cost savings are possible if providers and systems
of care are able to identify admission factors with greater prospects for in-home services after discharge.

Introduction
In recent years, home health care has been increasingly
regarded as the strategic alternative to postacute care with the
potential of addressing both quality and cost concerns in the
health care system. Patients with recent discharges from hos-
pital or those receiving provider referral typically qualify for
home health care.1,2 In many ways, home discharges should
be reflective of the patient's or family's involvement in the
discharge plan and capable of providing less expensive and
more convenient alternative to facility-based postacute care.
Several scholars have examined the value of home dis-
charges with respect to different aspects of postacute care.
These scholars have found disparate findings. For example,
discharges to home health care were determined to be less
expensive compared with inpatient rehabilitation facility or
skilled nursing facility among Medicare beneficiaries.3,4 A
study of outcomes among home-based care patients showed
that both clinical outcomes and quality of life improved at
the end of the follow-up period with quality of life levels
being comparable to national averages.5 Experience of care
is an important aspect of care quality and has to be assessed
at all care settings. In an examination of patient satisfaction
with home health care, Leff et al6 found patients receiving
care at home had high levels of satisfaction with better scores
in most domains used for comparisons with a comparable
hospital cohort. Cost savings have also been reported to ema-
nate from the use of home health care. Shapiro et al7 reported
significant Medicaid cost savings that were made in home
health care vis-à-vis nursing home costs.
The growing value placed on home discharges as the
future for quality improvement and cost savings in

postacute care is reflected in different policy measures
taken to control cost and resource utilization. For this rea-
son, a better understanding of factors leading to home dis-
charges will benefit health care providers and policy makers
in supporting efforts for implementation of delivery mecha-
nisms with the greatest potential for increasing home dis-
charges. In this study, we examined factors associated with
the likelihood of home discharges among Medicaid benefi-
ciaries receiving services from primary care plans in a geo-
graphically dispersed sample that represents 3 of the 4
geographic regions of the United States.
Methods
Study Population
We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of
Medicaid beneficiaries who were hospitalized in 4 states
located in each of the West, South, and Midwest regions of
the United States. In our analyses, de-identified Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicaid Analytic
eXtract (MAX) data system containing information for these
patients was used to examine discharge destinations. MAX
data contain detailed clinical and nonclinical information on
beneficiaries including patient status on discharge in any
given year of service.
Patients in the Sample
The data used in our analysis consisted of Medicaid enrollees
who received primary care services in the states of California,
Georgia, Michigan, and Mississippi in 2009. Overall, there
were 33
160 adult patients (aged 18 and above) who were
included in the analyses. These patients were either dis-
charged to their own homes (n = 13948) or to other hospitals
and other facilities, including skilled nursing facilities for
further treatment (n = 19212). We excluded from the analy-
sis patients who left the hospital against medical advice,
patients who died during hospitalization, and patients who
were referred to palliative care. Patients in the final sample
were examined to determine the total cost of hospitalization
prior to discharge. Total cost of hospitalization for each dis-
charge destination from a defined cohort of patients could set
the basis for future evaluation of patterns of care and final
cost of care when all discharge alternatives are compared.
Variables and Definitions
We examined patients according to the type of discharge des-
tination. In this way, in our analyses, the primary dependent
variable was classified as patients with home-based dis-
charges (ie, those who received the needed posthospitaliza-
tion care at home) and those with facility-based discharges
(ie, those who received the needed posthospitalization care at
other established facilities) in the year of study. In
our sample, patients who needed facility-based care after
hospitalization were those who were (1) discharged and
referred for outpatient care, (2) discharged to nursing facili-
ties, and (3) discharged to intermediate care facilities.
Independent variables represented clinical and demographic
characteristics among the patients. Demographic variables
included gender, race, location, and age, while clinical vari-
ables included length of stay (LOS, in days, and as a proxy
for cost of care in the regression model), procedure (whether
or not the patient had procedure on admission), and primary
diagnosis involving ambulatory care-sensitive condition
(ACSC) upon admission. By definition, ACSC are condi-
tions that lead to a hospital admission of which the onset
could have been prevented through a more easily accessible
ambulatory sector or one that provides better quality of care
at primary care level.8-10 This variable was treated as a
dichotomous variable, measuring the occurrence of ACSC-
related hospitalization in the target population. The
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) was used to assess
ACSC. Last, Medicare/Medicaid dual eligibility status was
included in the study to examine its impact on discharge
destination.
Statistical Analysis
To examine the likelihood of home discharges, we first con-
duct univariate analysis of discharges and other factors to
establish their distribution in the sample of the hospitalized
patients. Bivariate associations are also examined and
reported between the dependent variable and relevant inde-
pendent variables as well as among independent variables.
Then, we examine total cost of hospitalization prior to dis-
charge to determine how cost was distributed based on dis-
charge destination. We use multiple logistic regression to
assess the likelihood of home discharges in the Medicaid
population. This model is used to identify independent fac-
tors associated with home discharges.
Results
Table 1 presents distribution of the patients' demographic
and clinical characteristics as identified by discharge desti-
nation. Women made about two-thirds of discharges in each
category of discharge destination. The data showed patients
who were discharged to their homes were, on the average,
younger than those discharged to other facilities for contin-
ued care (52.2 vs 68.6 years). In terms of race, whites and
blacks had somewhat similar proportions among those who
were discharged to their homes (42.8% vs 40.6%), but white
patients had higher rates of facility-based discharges than
blacks (48.2% vs 35.1%). At the point of discharge, patients
with home discharges had higher average cost of hospitaliza-
tion than those getting facility-based discharges. While
patients did not have differences in the proportions of ACSC
Mkanta et al 3
and average LOS in the 2 discharge categories, patients with
home discharges had greater proportion of having proce-
dures on admission than those with facility-based discharges
(60.9% vs 35.6%). Patients with Medicare/Medicaid dual
eligibility had higher proportion of home discharges com-
pared with those with Medicaid-only coverage (54.2% vs
34.0%). With the exception of California (11%), all other
states in the study had patients with greater proportions of
home-based discharges (between 11% and 22% higher).
Table 2 displays the breakdown of total cost of hospital-
ization prior to discharge. It is shown that, on one hand,
patients with discharges to institutional discharge destina-
tions--nursing facility (US$5581.60) and intermediate care
facility (US$5953.45)--had lower average total cost of
hospitalization compared with patients discharged to outpa-
tient care, who had nearly twice the cost (US$11
502.00).
On the other hand, patients with home-based discharges
had higher cost of hospitalization than institutionally dis-
charged patients but lower than that of patients discharged
to outpatient settings.
We used multiple logistic regression model to assess the
likelihood of home discharges in Medicaid patients with hos-
pitalizations in the study states. Table 3 shows the results of
the logistic regression model in terms of odds ratios (ORs)
and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
According to the results of the logistic regression for the
prediction of home discharges, we found that female patients
were more likely than males to be discharged to their own
homes (Table 3). Specifically, women were 63% more likely
than men to get home discharges (OR = 1.631, 95% CI,
1.520-1.751). The data also showed that age was a predictor
for home discharges with higher age being associated with
lower odds of home discharges (OR = 0.970, 95% CI, 0.968-
0.972). Compared with white and black patients, Hispanic

patients had lower odds of getting home discharges (OR =
1.624, 95 CI, 1.413-1.866 and OR = 1.375, 95% CI, 1.191-
1.587, respectively, vs OR = 0.820, 95% CI, 0.660-1.019).
The results showed that longer hospital stays were associated
with decreased odds of home discharge (OR = 0.988, 95%
CI, 0.986-0.990). Furthermore, having a procedure on admis-
sion increased the odds of home-based discharges (OR =
1.737, 95% CI, 1.621-1.862), while being admitted with
ACSC decreased the odds of home-based discharges among
Medicaid patients (OR = 0.739, 95% CI, 0.684-0.798).
Patients with dual eligibility were about 65% more likely
than those with Medicaid-only coverage to get home-based
discharges (OR = 1.646, 95% CI, 1.512-1.791). Last, we
found that compared with patients residing in the state of
Mississippi, patients in California and Georgia were associ-
ated with, respectively, 83% (OR = 0.165, 95% CI, 0.148-
0.184) and 17% (OR = 0.829, 95% CI, 0.760-0.908) lower
odds, while those in Michigan had 21% (OR = 1.207, 95%
CI, 1.084-1.343) higher odds of home discharges.
Discussion
The current study attempts to create more insights into the
patient factors related to home-based discharges from hospi-
tal. Effective assessment of the factors at the point admission
could increase the potential for achieving the objectives of
posthospital care needed at the home settings. In addition to
the prospects of increasing the number of patients with dis-
charges to comfortable and familiar home environment, from
policy and quality perspectives, knowledge of the profile of
patients with the likelihood of home discharges would com-
plement the national efforts in cost containment and manage-
ment of resource utilization by establishing the right strategy
for successful home-based care.11,12
We found that women were more likely than men to get
home discharges following hospitalizations. With about 58%
of Medicaid enrollees in the nation being female,13 this find-
ing suggests that there is a greater potential for women mak-
ing the larger proportion of patients receiving home-based
care after hospital discharge, consequently leading to signifi-
cant cost savings. Providers and caregivers have to adapt to
gender-specific, home-based approaches to care that will
meet the needs of patients in home settings. Community fac-
tors such as rural or urban setting and neighborhood resources
should be incorporated in the process of care to improve
compliance and enhance patient's perception of familiarity
with the environment of care.
Another important predictor for home discharges was
patient's age. The data showed that older patients in the sam-
ple were significantly less likely to be discharged to their
homes. In spite of this finding, however, in instances where
patient preference might be sought in choosing a discharge
destination, older patients might be more inclined to prefer
home-based discharges due to expectations in care that could
vary with age. Previous studies have established that age is
associated with increased use of health care resources,14
which could be explained in part by the fact that age is highly
correlated with morbid chronic conditions leading to high
inpatient utilization. Combined with our findings, this sug-
gests that in the times when the nation is experiencing
increased proportion of aging population, cost savings are
possible if home settings are promoted to become the regular
place for care provided to the traditionally high-utilization
group of older aged adults. Furthermore, in absence of any
clear evidence from the current study on the role of race in
encouraging high rates and volumes of home discharges
among Hispanic patients, strategies based on the previously
discussed influence of gender and age could be used to
ensure patients of all races understand and value (the impor-
tance of) home health services.
As concluded from earlier research, ACSC are conditions
that may be treated effectively in outpatient care settings and
thus with great potential for reducing the need for inpatient
care.15,16 We found out patients hospitalized with primary
diagnoses of ACSC were less likely to be discharged to their
homes. Although this study could not clarify the reason for
this trend, one possible explanation is that persons admitted
with ACSC might be admitted when in very severe state with
these conditions due to delays in seeking care or other rea-
sons related to their use of primary care services. As a quality
perspective, the health care system should continue to find
means to promoting effective use of primary care services to
reduce the volume of preventable inpatient care that is com-
monly costly and more complex. At the least, primary care
providers should be able to assist patients having chronic
cases of ACSC with information on how to receive case
management and/or disease management services to reduce
hospitalizations.
The increased potential for home discharges among
patients who undergo medical procedures during hospital
admissions could be partly reflective of the level of sophisti-
cation attained in health care services. Same-day discharges
or short-stay hospitalizations are possible for increasing
numbers of patients with various types of medical proce-
dures. While initial charges of having a procedure could be
high, cost savings are possible over the entire episode of care
if the longer duration of care is organized and delivered at
home. Investment in medical technologies that have the
potential to reduce the intensity of hospital care should be
encouraged at the design stage as part of the policy adopted
for cost containment and quality improvement. Such techno-
logical interventions would be widely adopted if they are
capable of producing outcomes reflecting true efficiencies of
providers and systems of care, for example, when it becomes
possible to reduce hospital stays without necessarily increas-
ing readmission rates.17
Intuitively, prolonged lengths of hospital stay should res-
onate genuine need for inpatient services, and, as a result,
those requiring the services might stay for relatively extended
periods of time followed by facility-based discharges. In our
Mkanta et al 5
analyses, increased LOS was associated with decreased like-
lihood of home discharges, perhaps suggesting high intensity
of care required for Medicaid enrollees, especially those with
ACSC, even after hospitalizations. Such patients might be
responsible for excessive cost among patients with home dis-
charges as observed at the bivariate level (Tables 1 and 2) .
Effective primary care services together with enhanced
health promotion and preventive health capacities should be
regarded as key to the continuing effort to reduce the volume
of inpatient care. Eventually, the relationships of LOS and
expenditure with discharge destination would be more mean-
ingful if examined based on specific types of conditions or
subpopulations of Medicaid enrollees.
Previous studies have found that dual eligibility is associ-
ated with high utilization of health services.18,19 Our findings
that individuals with dual eligibility have higher likelihood
of home discharges suggest further examination is required
to determine any possible factors contributing to this associ-
ation. Both patient factors and system factors such as
Medicare provisions for home health services need to be
investigated to determine whether they could be responsible
for increasing the likelihood of delivering resource-friendly,
cost-effective home-based care to dually eligible patients.
Market forces and specific state provisions on Medicaid
coverage could be responsible in state variations seen in the
likelihood of home-based discharges. For example, pay
freezes and rate cuts exercised in different states might have
created aggressive approaches in hospital services in some
states where large volumes of patients were able to be dis-
charged to their homes compared with other states.
Several limitations are acknowledged in this study. First,
although we computed the likelihood of home discharges that
were meant for continued care, it is possible that in our analy-
ses we included some patients who were discharged to their
homes after the completion of treatment routines. Second, it
is important to note that our data consist of information on
discharges from general hospitalizations. A study involving
discharges from specific health conditions or other defined
patient groups could have provided a more concise estimation
of the home-based discharges. Last, the cross-sectional design
used in this study limits the ability to determine any causality
in the observed relationships used to assess the likelihood of
home-based discharges in the studied Medicaid population.
Despite the limitations, however, this study drew its strength
from the large size of the data involved and the analyses that
produced findings critical for understanding factors impact-
ing discharge destination in Medicaid population.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that there is a potential
for successful cost-containment strategies in utilization of
resources associated with inpatient care if careful plans are
made to identify patients who can be successfully discharged
to their home settings to continue with posthospital care.
Hospitals and systems of care should invest in understanding
and supporting design, management, and operations of care
delivered at home. They should have the interest of making
home-based settings a preferred destination for patients
receiving posthospital care if meaningful cost savings are to
be achieved.
