Introduction
Exploring the link between shifting power and variation in a
state's foreign policy has long been central to the study of
international relations. However, it has also become a ques-
tion of increased political importance as policy-makers in the
United States grapple with fears of decreasing international
influence caused by the economic and military growth of
great power competitors. Scholarship exploring this topic has
been deeply divided, with prominent scholars such as Brooks
et al. (2013), Copeland (2000), and Gilpin (1983) suggesting
that a strategy of retrenchment will leave declining states less
safe and less prosperous and Copeland (2000) and Gilpin
(1983) contending that retrenchment will open a declining
state up to predation and imperil their security. On the other
hand, scholars such as Layne (2009, 2012), MacDonald and
Parent (2011), and Posen (2013) suggest that retrenchment
will lead to a more secure and prosperous America.
Although there has been intense theoretical debate regard-
ing the benefits and costs of retrenchment, these theories have
only been tested on a handful of cases with various degrees of
methodological rigor. Work by MacDonald and Parent (2011)
represents one notable exception as they base their findings
on a cross-case analysis of all major powers over the same
time span that we analyze. However, their analysis is limited
in its ability to control for confounding factors that may affect
the success of strategies of retrenchment. We build on this
work by testing these arguments on a time-series cross-
sectional dataset of all major powers that stretches from 1870
to the present. Scholars have often pointed to the United
Kingdom's successful policy of retrenchment following
World War II as a rare exception to an otherwise bleak record
(Gilpin, 1983). Our findings suggest that retrenchment is gen-
erally effective, making states more likely to recover their
previous power and less likely to experience the most danger-
ous interstate conflicts.
We propose two hypotheses that directly test two of the
most contentious claims in the literature.
H1: When in a period of decline, a state that chooses to
retrench will be more likely to recover their previous
position than a state that does not.
H2: A great power experiencing a period of decline will
be less likely to be the target of predation at the hands of
fellow states than a great power that does not.

Abstract
Within foreign policy and academic circles in the United States and other western countries, retrenchment has become an
increasingly controversial topic. In spite of the increased attention, there have been few empirical studies that rigorously
examine the outcomes of great power retrenchment. In this paper, we seek to fill this gap by performing a quantitative
analysis of great power retrenchment outcomes from 1870­2007. Counter to the retrenchment pessimists' expectations,
we find that retrenchment leads to relatively positive outcomes for declining states. States that choose to retrench
experience shorter periods of economic decline and are less likely to be the target of predatory conflict initiation.

Research Note
2 Research and Politics 
Research design
We test our argument on a sample comprising all states
identified as great powers by the Correlates of War (COW)
project from 1870 to 2007. This specific time-span is ana-
lyzed due to data availability.1 States enter the dataset in
1870 or the first year thereafter in which they achieve great
power status and exit the dataset when they lose their great
power status for the last time. The full list of countries and
years included in the data is provided in Table 1.
To operationalize relative power, we follow MacDonald
and Parent (2011) in constructing an ordinal ranking of all
great powers in a given year. States are ranked according to
their overall share of gross domestic product (GDP) per
capita among great powers. This is preferable to measures
of absolute power, such as overall capabilities, that do not
allow us to capture the relational nature of our theory. States
can experience relative decline because their own eco-
nomic performance is poor, or because other states are sim-
ply advancing faster than they are.2
States are coded as entering a period of relative decline
when they lose at least one rank in a given year. States exit
a period of decline, or recover, when they regain at least
one ordinal rank after they enter a period of decline. In our
view, partial recoveries that reverse the process of decline
without restoring a state to its full previous rank still indi-
cate successful retrenchment. We also believe that states
should maintain their improved ranking for some minimum
period of time. States that regain a rank but immediately
lose it again have not successfully recovered. Since we
have no strong theoretical priors regarding how long this
period should be, we use two different thresholds and pre-
sent results for both. One requires a state to maintain their
improved ranking for at least one year after recovery, and
the other requires states to maintain their ranking for five
years. Once states recover, they become "at risk" of experi-
encing another period of decline.
To operationalize retrenchment, we use the percentage
change in a state's military expenditures over the previous
year as a proxy for its military posture. Whether they are
drawing down foreign commitments or decreasing mili-
tary investment at home, states engaged in a strategy of
retrenchment should display declining military expendi-
tures. This provides a continuous measure that allows us
to capture both whether a state retrenches and the degree
to which it does so. Data on military expenditures come
from the COW project's National Military Capabilities
Dataset and are measured in nominal values (Lemke and
Reed, 1998).3 Because we do not have reliable data on the
inflation rate for military capabilities, we choose not to
adjust these values for inflation. This decision should be
inconsequential for our results, since we care more about
yearly changes in military expenditures rather than their
absolute level.4
We include several control variables to ensure that our
models capture the effects of adopting a strategy of
retrenchment rather than changes in latent military capa-
bilities. To control for the effects of a state's absolute power,
independent of its position relative to other states, we
include the absolute level of GDP per capita. We also
include the change in GDP per capita over the previous
year to control for abrupt changes in absolute power.
We also control for factors that may affect a state's abil-
ity to retrench effectively. First, states with strong alliance
portfolios should have an easier time retrenching by relying
on allies to take up the slack in managing international
security threats. We control for this using the S alliance
score measure, which provides a measure of alliance port-
folio strength relative to the system leader (Small and
Singer, 1969). Second, states capable of nuclear deterrence
may be able to reduce military spending more easily by cut-
ting conventional capabilities. We control for this using
data on nuclear weapons status from Jo and Gartzke (2007).
Third, regime type may have an effect on a state's ability to
retrench. Because autocracies possess less veto players, we
expect that they may be able to adjust their spending priori-
ties more easily. In addition, since well-consolidated
regimes of either type may be more capable of adjusting
state policy than anocracies, regime type may have a curvi-
linear effect on our variables. To account for this, we
include both the state's Polity2 score and its square using
data from the Polity IV dataset (Marshall and Jaggers,
2002).5 To avoid the possibility of simultaneity bias, we lag
our independent variables and the control variables account-
ing for power by one year in all models.
Recovery models
H1 predicts that states in periods of decline are more likely
to recover their previous status if they retrench. To test this,
we use discrete time duration models to estimate the prob-
ability that a state in a period of decline recovers in a given
year. The dependent variable for these models is our binary
indicator of Recovery. For each version of our Recovery
variable (1 year and 5 year), we estimate binomial logit
models on the subset of the data for all years in which a
state is coded as in decline. We model the change in the
Table 1. Countries included in sample.

probability of failure as a function of time using cubic poly-
nomials of the time since the beginning of the period of
decline (Carter and Signorino, 2010). Because some coun-
tries never experience decline, both sets of models omit
observations on some countries.
We begin by discussing the results of our models that
employ the one year recovery threshold (see Table 2).
Model 1 estimates the probability of recovery solely as a
function of a state's change in military expenditures.
Model 2 introduces the control variables discussed above,
and Model 3 introduces fixed effects for each country
(i.e., unit-specific intercepts) to control for unobserved
heterogeneity induced by including repeated measures on
the same units. Taken together, these results provide mod-
est support for the argument that retrenchment helps a
state recover their previous standing during periods of
decline. Although the coefficient on changes in military
expenditures is insignificant in Model 1 and 2, controlling
for unobserved heterogeneity in Model 3 reveals that
increases in military expenditures have a negative and
significant effect (at the 0.1 level) on the probability of
recovery. Put otherwise, states that decrease their military
spending in a given year are less likely to experience
recovery in the following year.
To illustrate the substantive significance of this effect,
Figure 1 plots the predicted probability of recovery as a
function of changes in military expenditures with all other
variables held at their observed values. The probability of
recovery is highest after states make significant cuts in their
military spending. This probability steadily decreases from
0.239 to 0.018 at the high end of military expenditures,
indicating that states which make sharp increases in their
military spending have almost no chance of recovery.
Table 3 presents the results of our models using the five
year recovery threshold. Although the coefficients are in
the predicted direction, our military expenditures variable
is not significant in any of the three models. In addition,
including fixed effects in the model requires dropping a
number of cases, since several states never experience our
more restrictive coding of recovery. As such, it is difficult
to draw firm conclusions on the basis of these models. In
sum, we find some evidence that retrenchment facilitates
recovery, although this is sensitive to both measurement
and model specification.
Predation models
H2 predicts that states in periods of decline may be subject
to increased attacks by enemy states. To test this argument,
we use binomial logistic regression to model the probability
that a great power is attacked by another state. Our depend-
ent variable is a measure of whether another state initiated a
militarized interstate dispute (MID) against a state in a given
year (Palmer et al., 2015). Because we care about whether
other states actually attack declining great powers, we
restrict our analysis to MIDs that involve fatalities. Our pri-
mary independent variables are our indicator of whether a

state is in decline and our measure of retrenchment. Since
the choice of recovery threshold determines how long a state
is coded as in decline, we run models using both our one
year and five year coding schemes. We present the models
using our one year threshold here. Models using the five
year threshold are included in the Supplementary Online
Appendix. These models include the same control variables
discussed in the previous section as well as cubic polynomi-
als of the number of years since the last MID initiation.
Table 4 presents the results of these models. Model 1
includes only our measures of decline and retrenchment,
Model 2 introduces control variables, and Model 3 intro-
duces fixed effects for each country year. Our results pro-
vide modest support for the argument that states
experiencing relative decline are subject to opportunistic
attacks by challengers. Although this effect does not reach
conventional levels of statistical significance in Model 1, it
becomes significant after introducing control variables
(Model 2) and fixed effects (Model 3). Holding all other
variables constant at their observed values, the predicted
probability of fatal MID onset in a given year is 0.063 for
states in periods of decline and 0.031 for states that are not.
As such, great powers in periods of decline are effectively
twice as likely to be attacked by another state in a given
year. This provides support for the argument that great
powers may be subject to opportunistic attacks by challeng-
ers during periods of weakness.
We also find modest support for the proposition that
great powers that retrench may be able to avoid predatory
attacks by challengers. The coefficient for change in mili-
tary expenditures is positive and significant at the 0.1 level
in two of our three models. This indicates that increases in
military spending are associated with an increased risk of
predatory attacks. This effect is also substantively signifi-
cant. To provide some intuition of the size of the effect,

using Model 3 across the observed range of our

observed values. The predicted probability of fatal MID
onset increases from 0.008 at the minimum to 0.146 at its
maximum. This provides modest support for the position of
retrenchment optimists. Although great powers do appear
to be subject to attack during periods of relative decline,
our results suggest that states that decrease their military
expenditures may be less prone to this type of behavior.
On the whole, our results are relatively robust. In gen-
eral, the predicted values of both sets of models track well
with the observed data.6 Both our models of recovery and
predation are robust to changes in the coding of our decline
variable using both one and five year thresholds for our
recovery variable. However, our results are somewhat sen-
sitive to measurement and model specification, which
points to the need for further testing before drawing firm
conclusions. In particular, the fixed effects model performs
well in all of our analyses. We believe this is the theoreti-
cally most appropriate model, since it controls for unit-
effects and corrects for the violations of the assumption that
observations are measured independently. Nonetheless, this
speaks to the need for further testing before drawing firm
conclusions on the basis of our results. Additional studies
that employ alternate measures of power and retrenchment
would be especially useful in this regard.
Conclusion
In this paper, we have assessed the outcomes of great power
retrenchment using a dataset of all great powers from
1870­2007. Counter to the expectations of the skeptics, we
have found that retrenchment has led to relatively success-
ful outcomes. Declining states that choose to retrench expe-
rience shorter periods of relative economic decline and are
less likely to be the targets of predation than declining
states that choose not to retrench. While these findings are
suggestive, more research needs to be done to fully assess
the outcomes of retrenchment. Among other topics, future
work should explore the impact that retrenchment has on
the credibility of the international commitments that the
declining state chooses to maintain. Additionally, our data
contain a number of instances of declining states that chose
not to retrench and subsequently experienced prolonged
economic problems and predation. Our findings suggest
that retrenchment would have mitigated some of the nega-
tive effects of decline. Of these cases, post-World War II
France represents and interesting instance of a declining
power that chose not to retrench (Spruyt, 2005). Future
research should employ quantitative counterfactual analy-
ses, such as synthetic control, to explore how retrenchment
could have changed France's fortunes.

Notes
1. 1870 is the earliest year for which reliable gross national
product data are available for most of the countries in our
sample. 2007 is the latest year covered by the National
Military Capabilities Data.
2. Our data come from MacDonald and Parent (2011), who
construct an updated version of Angus Maddison's (1995)
data using Maddison's industry of origin method to fill in
missing observations. Gross domestic product is measured in
real values in millions of 1990 international Geary­Khamis
dollars. Additional missing data have been imputed using
draws from a multivariate normal distribution.
3. Military expenditures are measured in British pounds from
1870­1913 and US dollars afterwards. Because we care about
relative differences in military spending rather than overall
levels, this change should not substantially affect our results.
4. Since our measure of gross domestic product (GDP) per cap-
ita is adjusted for inflation and our military expenditures data
are not, we choose not to normalize military expenditures
according to GDP. This should not influence our results,
since we care about changes in a state's military posture, not
the overall level of spending relative to a state's budget.
5. Descriptive statistics for all variables are included in the
Supplementary Online Appendix.
