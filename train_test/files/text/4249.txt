Introduction
Short-term intravascular access devices, which include
central venous and arterial catheters, are commonly used
for the management of critically ill patients with the major-
ity of patients receiving care that involves the use of these
catheters (Curtis, 2009). The use of intravascular catheters
is, however, associated with the risk of bloodstream infec-
tions (BSI); a leading cause of healthcare-associated infec-
tions (HCAI). In a recent survey reported by the Health
Protection Agency (now Public Health England) blood

Abstract
Purpose: To estimate the economic impact of a TegadermTM chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) gel dressing compared
with a standard intravenous (i.v.) dressing (defined as non-antimicrobial transparent film dressing), used for insertion site
care of short-term central venous and arterial catheters (intravascular catheters) in adult critical care patients using a
cost-consequence model populated with data from published sources.
Material and Methods: A decision analytical cost-consequence model was developed which assigned each patient
with an indwelling intravascular catheter and a standard dressing, a baseline risk of associated dermatitis, local infection
at the catheter insertion site and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), estimated from published second-
ary sources. The risks of these events for patients with a Tegaderm CHG were estimated by applying the effective-
ness parameters from the clinical review to the baseline risks. Costs were accrued through costs of intervention (i.e.

Tegaderm CHG or standard intravenous dressing) and hospital treatment costs depended on whether the patients had
local dermatitis, local infection or CRBSI. Total costs were estimated as mean values of 10,000 probabilistic sensitivity
analysis (PSA) runs.
Results: Tegaderm CHG resulted in an average cost-saving of £77 per patient in an intensive care unit. Tegaderm CHG
also has a 98.5% probability of being cost-saving compared to standard i.v. dressings.
Conclusions: The analyses suggest that Tegaderm CHG is a cost-saving strategy to reduce CRBSI and the results were
robust to sensitivity analyses.

stream infections accounted for 7.3% of all HCAI and of
these 64% were in patients with a vascular access device
(Health Protection Agency, 2011).
Infections associated with intravascular catheters are
often categorised as either central-line associated blood-
stream infection (CLABSI) or catheter-related bloodstream
infection (CRBSI). The former term is often used in rela-
tion to epidemiological studies on the surveillance of
bloodstream infections and the latter where a high degree
of confidence in the origins of the infection is determined.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
recommends the CLABSI definition be used for surveil-
lance of infections and defines it as: a confirmed BSI in any
patient with a central venous catheter (CVC) present either
at the time of or within a 48-h period before the detection of
infection. CLABSI are likely therefore to overestimate the
incidence of CRBSI, as they do not fully confirm the source
of infection as the intravascular catheter. CRBSI is more
frequently used in clinical research being a more precise
and rigorous definition that requires isolation of the same
microorganism from the catheter tip and peripheral blood
or other validated methods including comparison of the
numbers of microorganisms present in peripheral blood
with samples obtained through the catheter or the differen-
tial time to positivity of blood obtained via the catheter ver-
sus peripheral blood (Chopra et al., 2013). For the purposes
of this report we have used a single term and describe both
CRBSI and CLABSI as CRBSI.
The risk of CRBSI is associated with a variety of factors
including the site of insertion of the device and the severity
of the patients underlying clinical condition. In 2009, the
CDC estimated the number of CRBSI in intensive care
units (ICUs) across the United States to be 18,000
(Srinivasan et al., 2011). In a pan-European survey of ICU
patients, the incidence of CRBSI was in the range of 1­3.1
per 1000 patient days (Suetens et al., 2007). The reported
incidence of CRBSI has decreased in more recently reported
studies following various interventions including a care
bundle approach. For example, in a national critical care
programme in the UK, the incidence of CRBSI fell from
3.7 to 1.48 per 1000 patient days (Bion et al., 2013).
However, CRBSI are still associated with attributable mor-
tality rates of up to 11.5% and may extend ICU stay by up
to 12 days (Renaud and Brun-Buisson, 2001; Soufir et al.,
1999). Each CRBSI has been estimated to cost $16,550 and
initiatives to reduce this complication raise the possibility
of substantial savings (O'Grady et al., 2011).
More recently, improvements in quality of care have
focused on initiatives with a care bundle of evidence-based
interventions. For example, the introduction of a central
venous insertion bundle into multiple ICUs in Michigan,
which included implementation and close monitoring of
hand hygiene, the application of chlorhexidine skin prepa-
rations and the use of the subclavian vein resulted in a
decrease of CR-BSI by 66% (Pronovost et al., 2006).
Many interventions are included in the current guidelines
for insertion and care of CVCs. The guidelines available
include those from the UK's National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence (NICE) relating to infections in pri-
mary care (NICE, 2012), epic3 which present national
guidelines primarily for hospitals in UK (Loveday et al.,
2014) and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices
Advisory Committee (HICPAC) guidelines in US (O'Grady
et al., 2011). The interventions recommended include: full
barrier precautions during insertion; use of a 2% chlorhex-
idine gluconate in alcohol for care of the catheter insertion
site; the application of sterile transparent dressings to cover
the insertion site with replacement at least every 7 days; and
the use of alcohol to disinfect hubs and ports prior to access.
Additional approaches to prevent CRBSI have included
the introduction of new technological innovations, including
antiseptic impregnated central catheters and chlorhexidine
impregnated sponge dressings, which have also been associ-
ated with significant reductions in infection rates (Casey
et al., 2008; Timsit et al., 2009). In certain healthcare institu-
tions, where both bundle interventions and technological
solutions have been implemented, the prospect of zero CRBSI
is considered to be a potential goal. (Zingg et al., 2011).
More recently, the epic3 updated guideline included the
recommendation to use a 2% chlorhexidine gel dressing for
intravascular catheters (Loveday et al., 2015). The purpose
of the current study was to develop a model to evaluate the
economic value of implementing such a 2% chlorhexidine
gel dressing in the care of insertion sites associated with
CVC and arterial catheters in critically ill adult patients.
There is a paucity of studies which have demonstrated cost-
savings with individual infection prevention interventions.
In the UK, NICE (NICE, 2011) uses cost-consequence
analysis to evaluate medical devices. We therefore used a
similar approach to estimate the cost impact of introducing
Tegaderm chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) dressing (3M
Health Care, Loughborough, UK) into clinical practice in
adult critical care. The Tegaderm CHG dressing delivers
chlorhexidine over 7 days from an integrated gel pad placed
over the point of insertion of an intravascular catheter. A
previous study (Timsit et al., 2012) has suggested it is asso-
ciated with significant reductions in CRBSI compared to
standard, non-medicated, transparent film dressings (stand-
ard intravenous [i.v.] dressings). This paper describes a
decision analytic model, informed by parameters derived
from published data, which has been used to estimate costs
associated with the use of Tegaderm CHG i.v. dressings
compared with standard i.v. dressings.
Material and methods
A decision analytical model (Petrou et al., 2011) was devel-
oped using Microsoft Excel software (Microsoft
Corporation) to estimate the economic impact of a
Tegaderm CHG dressing when compared with standard i.v.
218 Journal of Infection Prevention 17(5)
dressings (defined as standard non-antimicrobial transpar-
ent film dressings) for patients admitted to an ICU requir-
ing an intravascular catheter. The economic perspective of
the model is the National Health Service (NHS) in England
and Wales. The model used a short time horizon and the
structure of the model is shown in Figure 1.
The model assigned each patient with an indwelling
intravascular catheter and a standard i.v. dressing, a base-
line risk of associated dermatitis, local infection at the cath-
eter insertion site and CRBSI. The risks of these events for
patients with a Tegaderm CHG were estimated by applying
the effectiveness parameters derived from the published lit-
erature to the baseline risks. Costs were accrued through
costs of intervention (i.e. Tegaderm CHG or standard i.v.
dressing) and hospital treatment costs depended on whether
the patients had dermatitis, local infection or CRBSI.
Results were estimated as mean values of 10,000 probabil-
istic sensitivity analysis (PSA) runs, each run with a differ-
ent estimate for the risks, hazard ratios (HR) and costs
sampled from probability distributions representing uncer-
tainty in the parameter estimates.
Baseline risks
Baseline risks were estimated using data from existing med-
ical literature. The outcomes included in the model were: (1)
CRBSI; (2) local site infection; and (3) dermatitis.
The baseline primary outcome measure, CRBSI, was
estimated from `Matching Michigan': a 2-year study of
central venous CRBSI in ICUs in England (Bion et al.,
2013). This study reported an average rate of 1.48 catheter-
related infections per 1000 adult catheter days, which is
similar to the rate reported in other studies (Edwards et al.,
2009; Timsit et al., 2012). The average length of stay in an
ICU for a patient with a catheter has been estimated to be
10 days, a value that has been used in another economic
analysis (Ye et al., 2011). In the economic model, CRBSI
risk per patient was estimated by multiplying this length of
stay by the CRBSI rate which resulted in a mean CRBSI
risk of 0.0148 per patient.
A key secondary outcome measure of interest was the
local site infection rate. There are substantially different esti-
mates of incidence reported in various sources, with inci-
dence in the range of 10­30%. Crawford et al. (2004) used a
local infection rate of 18.1% in their economic analysis and
Vokurka et al. (2009) reported a rate of local site infection of
30%. However, Pemberton et al. (1996) reported the rate of
local site infection as 10% when using non-antimicrobial
transparent film dressings. This figure was also used in the
economic analysis by Ye et al. (2011) concerning an antimi-
crobial patch. In this current economic model, a conservative
estimate of a mean local site infection rate of 10% was used
as shown in Table 1 for the base case analysis.
Another outcome of interest was dermatitis. A dermatitis
rate of 1.1% was associated with the use of Tegaderm CHG
as compared to 0.29% for standard dressings (Timsit et al.,
2012). However, this study was undertaken using a first
generation version of the Tegaderm CHG dressing that
appears to have a higher occurrence of this type of adverse
event compared to the current version of the dressing that
utilises a higher permeability film backing. Indeed, the
introduction of a second generation Tegaderm CHG dress-
ing was associated with a reduction in the number of skin
reactions reported in Manufacturer and User Facility
Device Experience from 2010 to 2012, and in numbers that
were comparable to CHG sponge dressings (Jenks et al.,
2015). In a study by Schwebel et al. (2012) on the clinical
use of a CHG sponge dressing, a rate of device-related der-
matitis of 1.1 and 4.1/1000 catheters for a 3 and 7 days
CHG dressing change protocol, respectively, was reported.
The rate of dermatitis in the current model was assumed to
be the average of these two dressing change frequencies. In
this current study, a mean dermatitis rate of 2.6/1000 cath-
eters associated with the use of Tegaderm CHG dressing
was therefore used as shown in Table 1.
Effectiveness of Tegaderm CHG
The effectiveness parameters for Tegaderm CHG dressing
were estimated from Timsit et al. (2012), the only relevant
study identified in a systematic review which was under-
taken in accordance with recommendations in the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis
(PRISMA) statement. The purpose of the review was to
identify studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of
3M Tegaderm CHG dressings compared to standard i.v.
dressings used in routine care of patients (age >18 years)

admitted to a critical care setting such as an ICU who
required intravascular access--via an arterial catheter or
CVC or both--for at least 24 h. The details of the search
strategy used are provided in the appendix.
HRs estimated from Timsit et al. (2012) were used as
effectiveness parameters in the model for Tegaderm CHG
dressing. As used in Ye et al. (2011), the HR for local site
infection was assumed to be the same as the HR for CRBSI.
The probabilities of developing a CRBSI and local infec-
tions for patients given Tegaderm CHG dressing were esti-
mated by applying the HRs to the baseline parameters. For
dermatitis, the effectiveness of Tegaderm CHG dressing
was modelled as a relative risk (RR) and the probability of
dermatitis for patients with Tegaderm CHG dressing were
estimated by applying the RR to the baseline dermatitis
probability.
Costs
The costs included in the model are the costs of the dress-
ings and those associated with the treatment, where appro-
priate, for any local infections at the catheter insertion site,
CRBSI and dermatitis. It was assumed that all other initial
treatment costs were the same and were not included in the
model. The Tegaderm CHG dressing is readily adopted into
clinical practice and can directly replace standard i.v. dress-
ing in the care pathways for arterial and CVCs. Therefore,
no additional staff costs were included in the model.
The cost of standard care was estimated as the number of
standard i.v. dressings required multiplied by the unit cost of
this standard i.v. dressing. The number of dressings required
was estimated by dividing the average duration of stay of a
patient with a catheter on ICU in situ by the average dress-
ing duration. The average length of stay for a patient with an
intravascular catheter in situ on ICU was estimated to be 10
days (Ye et al., 2011) and with the prescribed time for stand-
ard i.v. dressing being between 3 and 7 days, this resulted in
three standard i.v. dressings required per patient. The unit
cost of a standard i.v. dressing was £1.34, as shown in Table
1 and thus, in the model, the average cost of standard i.v.
dressings per patient was calculated to be £4.02.
The cost of using Tegaderm CHG dressings per patient
was estimated as the number of Tegaderm CHG dressings
required multiplied by the unit cost of the Tegaderm CHG
dressing. The unit cost of Tegaderm CHG dressing was
£6.21 for the NHS as shown in Table 1. Again, the number
of dressings required was estimated by dividing the average
length of stay of a patient on an ICU with a catheter by the
average dressing duration. The average length of stay of a
patient on an ICU with an indwelling intravascular catheter
was taken as 10 days (Ye et al., 2011) and an estimate of
three dressings per patient resulted in the average cost of
Tegaderm CHG dressings per patient being £18.63.
The main cost driver included in the model was the cost
of CRBSI, which included costs of diagnosis, catheter
replacement and the costs associated with increased length

Normal distribution is represented with mean and SD, with 95% of the values in the distribution lying between 2 SDs on either side of the mean, e.g.
normal (10, 2) implies that 95% of the samples lie between 6 and 14. Lognormal distribution is a continuous probability distribution whose logarithm
is normally distributed. Gamma (a, b) distribution, where a is the shape parameter and b is the scale parameter, is typically used for skewed distribu-
tions and has a mean expected value of a × b, e.g. the average value of the samples of distribution Gamma (198, 50) is 9900 (i.e. 198 × 50).
220 Journal of Infection Prevention 17(5)
of stay. Schwebel et al. (2012) reported that the mean addi-
tional hospital length of stay for patients with CRBSI is 11
days, which resulted in a reported cost estimate of CRBSI
in excess of $25,000 (Schwebel et al., 2012; Ye et al., 2011).
In Europe, additional length of stay in ICU has been
reported as 9­10 days (Timsit et al., 2012). However, this
was regarded as longer than that seen in many ICUs in the
UK by our clinical experts (the co-authors of this manu-
script), who considered that the average length of stay for a
CRBSI patient will vary between 6 days (first 2 days in
ICU and the remaining 4 days in a general medical ward)
and 10 days (first 3 days in ICU and the remaining 7 days
in a general medical ward). In a UK hospital, the cost of an
average day in the ICU has been determined as being in the
range of £1800­2400 with an additional £100 for the con-
sultant time and consumables. This figure, in combination
with the extra ward based costs of £480 per day, results in
an average extra total cost of around £9750. Also, it is esti-
mated that in clinical practice approximately 50% of intra-
vascular catheters are removed due to suspected CRBSI
and if they are subsequently replaced the cost is estimated
to be £140 (acquisition cost of catheter £35; X-ray for con-
firming position of catheter £50 plus consumables of £15
plus staff costs to carry out the procedure at £40). In view
of this, a figure of £140 for catheter replacement has been
included in the total cost of CRBSI, which results in the
overall CRBSI cost of £9890. This figure is very similar to
that used in a Health Technology Assessment (HTA)
(Hockenhull et al., 2008) who reported a mean CRBSI cost
of £9148, that when inflated to present day costs using the
hospital and community health services (HCHS) pay and
price index (Curtis, 2013) is £9905. Thus, the cost of
CRBSI used in the model is £9900 as shown in Table 1.
The cost of treatment for a local site infection was
reported as $400 (Saint et al., 2000) and it was considered
that a cost of £250 for treatment of local infection in UK
was a reasonable estimate and was therefore adopted in the
model as shown in Table 1.
The costs of treating dermatitis were taken from
Schwebel et al. (2012), who reported that contact dermatitis
requires four standard i.v. dressings, removal of the catheter
and insertion of a new catheter. They used a micro-costing
approach to estimate the total costs as $228. We considered
that the equivalent cost of £150 for treatment of dermatitis
was acceptable and this was used in the model as shown in
Table 1.
Summary of model parameters
The decision analytic model assigned a baseline risk of dif-
ferent events for each patient with standard i.v. dressing.
The risks of these events for patients with Tegaderm CHG
dressing were estimated by applying the HRs from pub-
lished literature to the baseline risks. A summary of the
model parameters is provided in Table 1, along with their
sources. The scope of this study was adult intensive care
patients.
Results
First, we estimated the mean event rates that would be
expected in a typical patient if Tegaderm CHG dressing
were implemented instead of standard care. Tegaderm
CHG dressing reduces the all event rates per patient except
for dermatitis (Table 2). It is of note that the formulation of
the Tegaderm CHG dressing was changed in 2011 to
include a more permeable film on the back. The introduc-
tion of second generation Tegaderm CHG dressing was
associated with a reduction in the number of skin reactions
reported in Manufacturer and User Facility Device from
2010 to 2012 (FDA, 2014).
We then estimated the costs that would be expected in a
typical service for 1000 adult patients who require a short-
term intravascular catheter located in an ICU where
Tegaderm CHG dressing was the routine dressing instead
of a standard i.v. dressing. Results were estimated as mean
values of 1000 probabilistic sensitivity analysis runs, each
run with a different estimate for the risks, HRs and costs
sampled from the probability distributions reported in
Table 1. The model showed use of Tegaderm CHG dressing
results in an overall saving of £77,427 per 1000 patients,
i.e. an average cost saving of £77 (95% CI, £76.70­78.10)
per adult patient. The Tegaderm CHG dressing therefore
has a 98.5% probability of being cost-saving compared to
standard i.v. dressings.
The total cost-savings is provided as a breakdown of the
individual cost differences as shown in Table 3. Most of the
savings described are due to a reduction in suspected and
confirmed CRBSI. There are higher costs associated with
the acquisition of CHG dressings but the savings in reduced
event rates more than offset these costs associated with the
technology, as seen in Figure 2.
One-way sensitivity analysis was performed on all the
model parameters. The baseline CRBSI risks and unit cost

of CRBSI were identified as the key cost drivers while the
rest of the parameters did not have an impact on the results
or conclusions. Thus, only the results of sensitivity analysis
for CRBSI risks and costs are presented here. At a lower
CRBSI baseline risk of 0.5 per 1000 catheter days, the
mean cost savings were £22,747 and at a higher estimate of
2.5 per 1000 catheter days, the mean cost savings were
£133,591. At a lower cost estimate of CRBSI of £5000, the
mean cost savings were £36,174 while the cost savings
were £119,040 at a higher estimate of £15,000. Thus the
lower the CRBSI baseline risk and cost of CRBSI, the
lower the cost savings. Similarly, the higher the baseline
risk of CRBSI and the cost of CRBSI, the higher the aver-
age cost savings. Threshold analysis conducted suggested
that the baseline CRBSI risk has to be lower than 0.1 per
1000 catheter days for Tegaderm CHG dressing to not be
cost-saving.
Discussion
Our analyses suggest that Tegaderm CHG dressing is a
cost-saving strategy when implemented for care of adult
patients with intravascular catheters in ICU. Tegaderm
CHG dressing results in an overall savings of £77,427 per
1000 adult patients, i.e. an average cost saving of £77 per
patient compared to standard care with a 98.5% probability
of being cost-saving compared to standard i.v. dressings. A
12-bed ICU is estimated to admit approximately 770
patients each year, the majority of whom will receive an
intravascular catheter. The estimated cost savings for
replacement of standard i.v. dressings with Tegaderm CHG
dressing in such a unit is £59,600 per annum. The results
were robust to sensitivity analyses performed on the base-
line CRBSI risks and unit cost of CRBSI. These average
cost-savings reported are for units that follow the English
national trend for incidence of CRBSI reported by Bion
et al. (2013). Interestingly, the model also indicates that
cost-savings can be found even in units with levels of
CRBSI as low as 0.33 per 1000 catheter days.
Dermatitis has been identified as an adverse event that
has a higher risk for CHG containing dressings compared
to standard i.v. dressings. The results from this study indi-
cate that the costs associated with the management of the
related dermatitis per patient has a mean of £4.66. Another,
albeit uncommon but potentially serious, adverse event
associated with the use of chlorhexidine containing prod-
ucts is anaphylaxis (MHRA, 2012). However, no systemic
adverse events associated with use of Tegaderm CHG
dressing were reported during a comparative study includ-
ing 1879 adult patients (Timsit et al., 2012) and the poten-
tial costs associated with anaphylaxis were not included in
the model. It is of note that Tegaderm CHG dressing is not
indicated for use in patients aged under 2 months and our
study only included adult patients.
There are other published analyses studies of CHG
impregnated devices including CHG dressings, but to date
none of them included Tegaderm CHG gel dressing. The
analysis reported by Veenstra et al. (1999) compared the
number of CRBSIs associated with CHG impregnated and
standard intravascular catheters and suggested that antisep-
tic impregnated catheters are cost-saving. Crawford et al.
(2004) performed a trial based evaluation and concluded
that CHG sponge dressings would reduce costs, local infec-
tions and CRBSIs, and associated mortality. Similarly,
Hockenhull et al. (2008) developed a decision analytic
model for patients requiring CVCs in the UK and suggested
that antimicrobial CVCs are cost-saving. More recently, Ye
et al. (2011) suggested that a CHG dressing is also a cost-
effective CRBSI prevention treatment option. Furthermore,
Schwebel et al. (2012) performed a trial based evaluation

dressings and concluded that CHG dressings are associated
with financial savings. Our findings for Tegaderm CHG
dressing are, therefore, in line with those reported in previ-
ous studies for antimicrobial devices used to prevent cathe-
ter-related infections.
The analysis reported in this paper has some limitations.
Any modelling process involves simplifications and assump-
tions that may not accurately reflect local clinical practice.
Owing to the lack of detail of cost estimates in research stud-
ies included in the analysis, scenarios were developed and
their costs were independently reviewed by members of the
research team. The uncertainties about the assumptions made
in the estimation of these costs (especially CRBSI costs)
were tested using scenario analysis and the conclusion that
Tegaderm CHG dressing is cost-saving remains valid in
these analyses. Threshold analysis performed suggested that
the findings are robust and that large fluctuations in the
CRBSIratesandcostparametersareneededbeforeTegaderm
CHG dressing becomes cost incurring.
The results of the current analysis have important impli-
cations for the healthcare systems facing rising demand
from emergency admissions into ICUs. The evidence sug-
gests that the use of Tegaderm CHG dressing may substan-
tially reduce the incidence of CRBSI and in doing so
reduce the length of stay on an adult ICU and in subse-
quent clinical areas. This would also reduce the need for
the use of antibiotic therapy and the risk of emergence of
antimicrobial resistant microorganisms. The introduction
of Tegaderm CHG dressings may also alleviate some pres-
sure on acute beds and have associated consequent cost-
savings. In concurrence with these findings, NICE has
recently issued guidance suggesting that Tegaderm CHG
dressing is cost-saving for the NHS in England and Wales
(NICE, 2015).
