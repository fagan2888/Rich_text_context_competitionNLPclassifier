OBJECTIVE -- To describe the changes in demographics, antidiabetic treatment, and glyce-
mic control among the prevalent U.S. adult diagnosed type 2 diabetes population between the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (1988­1994) and the initial
release of NHANES 1999­2000.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- The study population was derived from
NHANES III (n  1,215) and NHANES 1999­2000 (n  372) subjects who reported a diagnosis
of type 2 diabetes with available data on diabetes medication and HbA1c
. Four therapeutic
regimens were defined: diet only, insulin only, oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) only, or OADs
plus insulin. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine changes in antidiabetic regimens
and glycemic control rates over time, adjusted for demographic and clinical risk factors. The
outcome measure for glycemic control was HbA1c
. Glycemic control rates were defined as the
proportion of type 2 diabetic patients with HbA1c
level 7%.
RESULTS -- Dietary treatment in individuals with diabetes decreased as the sole therapy from
27.4 to 20.2% between the surveys. Insulin use also decreased from 24.2 to 16.4%, while those
on OADs only increased from 45.4 to 52.5%. Combination of OADs and insulin increased from
3.1 to 11.0%. Glycemic control rates declined from 44.5% in NHANES III (1988­1994) to
35.8% in NHANES 1999­2000.
CONCLUSIONS -- Treatment regimens among U.S. adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes
have changed substantially over the past 10 years. However, a decrease in glycemic control rates
was also observed during this time period. This trend may contribute to increased rates of
macrovascular and microvascular diabetic complications, which may impact health care costs.
Our data support the public health message of implementation of early, aggressive management
of diabetes.
Diabetes Care 27:17­20, 2004
Inadequate glycemic control among in-
dividuals with diabetes constitutes a
major public health problem in the
U.S. Uncontrolled diabetes is associated
with premature death and disability as
well as decreased quality of life and sig-
nificantly adds to national medical health
care expenditures (1). Recent estimates
show that the minimum direct and indi-
rect expenditures attributable to diag-
nosed diabetes in 2002 were $132 billion
(2). Glycemic control remains the major
therapeutic objective for prevention of
target organ damage and other complica-
tions arising from diabetes. Studies have
shown that a comprehensive and aggres-
sive management approach is effective in
decreasing the rate of progression of mi-
crovascular complications (3). Treatment
regimens of diet and exercise, insulin, and
oral hypoglycemic agents are known to
improve glycemia (4,5), and current ap-
proaches to disease management that in-
clude greater patient self-participation are
recommended (6,7).
However, the adequacy of adherence
to American Diabetes Association guide-
lines, as reflected in estimates of glycemic
control (8), have not been published re-
cently for the U.S. population. A study of
U.S. adults sampled from 1988 to 1994
reported that the glycemic control rate
was only 44.6% among patients with di-
agnosed type 2 diabetes (9). Recently, the
initial 1999­2000 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
data have been released, providing an op-
portunity for further analysis. This report
describes the changes in demographics,
general drug treatment, and glycemic
control among the prevalent U.S. adult
diagnosed type 2 diabetes population be-
tween NHANES III (1988­1994) and
NHANES 1999­2000.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The study population
was derived from both the NHANES III
(1988­1994) and the initial release of
NHANES 1999­2000 (10). These sur-
veys used a multistage cluster sample de-
sign to gather data about the health and
nutritional status of the civilian noninsti-
tutionalized population of the U.S. and
have been described in detail elsewhere
(11). For our analysis, we defined the
study sample as the 1,686 subjects in
NHANES III (1988­1994) and the 533
subjects in NHANES 1999­2000 aged
20 years who responded "yes" to the
question "Other than during pregnancy,
has a doctor ever told you that you had
diabetes or sugar diabetes?" and in whom

HbA1c
had been measured. To limit the
analysis to adults with diagnosed type 2 di-
abetes, we excluded subjects whose age at
diagnosis was 30 years and who started
insulin therapy within 1 year of diagnosis.
We also excluded subjects for whom infor-
mation on type of diabetes medication,
BMI, or duration of diabetes was missing.
After applying the exclusions, 1,215 sub-
jects in NHANES III (1988­1994) and 372
subjects in NHANES 1999­2000 remained
for analysis. We used the NHANES sam-
pling weights and primary sampling units
to estimate the number of individuals with
diagnosed diabetes, by various demo-
graphic, treatment, and glycemic control
groups, in the overall U.S. population.
Four antidiabetic therapeutic regi-
mens were defined for this study: diet,
insulin, oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs;
monotherapy or in combination), and
OADs plus insulin. These were defined
according to a "yes" or "no" response to
the following questions: "Are you now
taking insulin?" and "Are you now taking
diabetes pills?" We classified individuals
who answered "no" to both of these ques-
tions as using diet-only therapy. The
number and percent of adults diagnosed
with type 2 diabetes on each therapeutic
regimen was calculated, as was the esti-
mate of those who achieved glycemic con-
trol using a cutpoint HbA1c
level 7%
(8). Glycemic control rates were calcu-
lated as the proportion of type 2 diabetic
patients with an HbA1c
level 7%. In
NHANES III (1988­1994), HbA1c
was
measured by high-performance liquid
chromatography assay, as in the Diabetes
Control and Complications Trial (12).
The upper limit of normal for HbA1c
in
the assay system is 6.1%, which is identi-
cal to the upper limit of normal recom-
mended by the American Diabetes
Association using the same assay system.
Glycohemoglobin for NHANES 1999­
2000 was measured using a Boronate
Affinity High Performance Liquid Chro-
matography system (Primus, Kansas City,
MO) (13), which has been standardized
to the reference method used for the Dia-
betes Control and Complications Trial.
Because the HbA1c
measurements were
standardized to the same reference
method, there were no differences in nor-
mal range or upper limit for HbA1c
in
NHANES III (1988­1994) and NHANES
1999­2000.
In addition to univariate analysis, we
used multiple logistic regression to exam-
ine whether demographics, treatment
regimen, and other differences between
the survey participants might explain any
observed changes in national glycemic
control rates between 1988 and 2000. In
this logistic model, glycemic control was
the dependent variable, the particular
NHANES survey was the independent
variable, and treatment regimen, age, sex,
ethnicity, BMI, and duration of diabetes
were potential confounding factors. In
similar fashion, logistic models were used
to determine whether changes in treat-
ment regimens between the two surveys
might be due to demographic and other
differences between the surveys' partici-
pants rather than real temporal changes.
SUDAAN software (Research Triangle
Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC)
was used to account for the nonrandom
cluster sample design in calculating vari-
ance estimates (14). Standard errors were
computed for all prevalence rates via Tay-
lor approximations. Using SAS statistical
software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), logis-
tic regression models were run with sam-
pling weights provided by the NHANES
surveys, allowing population-based effect
estimates. In the logistic models that in-
cluded both surveys, it was not possible to
calculate CIs for the effect estimates (odds
ratios [ORs]), because the sampling meth-
ods of the two surveys differ.
RESULTS -- Changes in demographic
and risk factor information between
NHANES III (1988­1994) and NHANES
1999­2000 are described in Table 1. The
number of prevalent cases of adults with
diagnosed type 2 diabetes increased from
8.1 million in 1988­1994 to 10.3 million
in 1999­2000. The proportion of men
increased from 45% in NHANES III
(1988­1994) to 51% in NHANES 1999­
2000; individuals with diabetes in 1999­
2000 were slightly younger than those in
the earlier survey. The percentage of non-
Hispanic whites among patients with di-
agnosed type 2 diabetes decreased from
74% in NHANES III (1988­1994) to
61% in NHANES 1999­2000. On the
other hand, there was a slight increase in
the percentage of non-Hispanic blacks
and Mexican Americans, and the propor-
tion of ethnic groups other than non-
Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,
and Mexican Americans increased from 6
to 17%. Mean BMI increased by 6% from
30.4 to 32.3 kg/m2, the mean duration of
diabetes increased by 28% from 9.3 to
11.9 years, and the mean HbA1c
increased
by 3% from 7.7 to 7.9%.

tween NHANES III (1988­1994) and
NHANES 1999­2000 are shown in Table

1,947,176) in NHANES III (1988­1994)
to 16.4% (n  1,679,985) in NHANES
1999­2000. The likelihood of medica-
tion use in NHANES 1999­2000 relative
to NHANES III, adjusted for potential
confounders, is represented by the ad-
justed ORs in Table 2. The adjusting fac-
tors were age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, and
duration of diabetes. An adjusted OR of
0.61 for insulin was found, indicating that
the odds of being treated with insulin only
decreased by 39% among the NHANES
1999­2000 survey participants com-
pared with the NHANES III (1988­1994)
participants. The proportion of subjects
using only OADs increased over time
(from 45.4% [n  3,655,259] to 52.5%
[n  5,384,943]; OR 1.50). The use of
insulin and OADs in combination in-
creased from 3.1% (n  248,616) to
11.0% (n  1,128,922) (OR 3.50). Use of
diet only decreased from 27.4% (n 
2,207,855) to 20.2% (n  2,070,771)
(OR 0.58).
The rate of glycemic control as de-
fined by HbA1c
levels 7% was 44.5% for
NHANES III (1988­1994) and 35.8% for
NHANES 1999­2000. After adjustment
for age, ethnicity, sex, BMI, medication
use, and duration of diabetes, the odds of
glycemic control was 21% lower in
NHANES 1999­2000 compared with
NHANES III (1988­1994) (OR 0.79; Ta-
ble 3).
CONCLUSIONS -- Our findings
show that the proportion of adults in the
U.S. with adequately controlled, diag-
nosed type 2 diabetes decreased between
1988 and 2000. Diabetes is controlled in
only 36% of the more recent survey par-
ticipants, despite recommendations for
early diagnosis and aggressive treatment
in recent years. We also observed changes
in the demographic distribution of the
adults with diagnosed type 2 diabetes
from NHANES III (1988 ­1994) to
NHANES 1999­2000, such as an in-
creased proportion of men and minority
groups other than non-Hispanic blacks
and Mexican Americans. In recent years,
individuals with diagnosed diabetes
tended to be younger, to weigh more, and
to have a longer duration of diabetes.
However, we found that these demo-
graphic differences did not fully explain
the lower glycemic control rates seen in
recent years. Other reasons might ac-
count for the observed declining rates
over time, such as changes in patient com-
pliance with treatment programs despite
more aggressive management. Another
possible explanation for this observation
may be surveillance bias due to a prefer-
ential increased screening for diabetes in
high-risk individuals in the late 1990s
compared with the previous decade.
In addition to changes in demo-
graphic features among patients over
time, we also observed changes in the
therapeutic regimen. The proportion of
current individuals with diagnosed diabe-
tes following diet-only or insulin-only
treatment regimens has decreased since
1988­1994, but the proportion receiving
OADs only or OADs in combination with
insulin has increased. This change may be
due to a larger selection of marketed oral
agents. The increase in use of OADs from
1994 to 2000 is likely because only sulfo-
nylureas were available in the earlier time
period. By 2000, at least six new products
in four new classes of OADs had become
available. Another reason for the observed
change may be a trend toward more ag-
gressive and earlier treatment with OADs
and OAD/insulin combinations.
We have also demonstrated that gly-
cemic control was better in older individ-
uals with diagnosed diabetes, those with
higher BMI, and those with a longer du-
ration of diagnosed diabetes (Table 3). Di-
abetic control was worse in minority
ethnic groups and those taking medica-
tions (as compared with those on diet
only). It is not clear why glycemic control
might be better in older individuals, but

some studies have suggested that older
patients may have better access to medical
care, are more motivated to receive care,
and are more compliant with medication
use (15). This finding is somewhat in con-
trast to that of the U.K. Prospective Dia-
betes Study (UKPDS), which suggested
that glycemic control rates among indi-
viduals with diabetes decrease with dis-
ease duration and, thus, with age (16).
Also in contrast to the current study, Har-
ris et al. (9) found that obesity was not
related to glycemic control. They attrib-
uted their results to the cross-sectional
design of the survey.
There are several limitations to the
current analysis. The sample size from the
NHANES 1999­2000 survey is small rel-
ative to NHANES III (1988­1994). As the
survey continues over the next few years,
more subjects will accrue, and the analy-
sis can be repeated. Another limitation is
that medication use is self-reported, and
this may cause some misclassification in
measured treatment regimens. Addition-
ally, because NHANES surveys are cross-
sectional in design, some of our findings
may be related to survival bias in that in-
dividuals with diabetes having the poor-
est control may have died over time and
could not participate in surveys. Also, in
1997, the American Diabetes Association
changed the diagnostic criteria for diabe-
tes, which may have influenced preva-
lence estimates of diagnosed diabetes
between the two NHANES surveys (8).
We conclude that the proportion of
adults in the U.S. with diagnosed type 2
diabetes that is controlled is inadequate
and less favorable than in previous years.
The cardiovascular and other conse-
quences of inadequate glycemic control
warrant serious consideration by treating
physicians and others who care for indi-
viduals with diabetes. These data lend
support to public health initiatives advo-
cating early and aggressive management
of diabetes.
