Introduction
Estimating the bathymetry of ocean is one of the important
parameters which plays a significant role in planning near-
shore structure activities such as engineering work, port
management, pipeline laying, fishing, dredging operation,
oil drilling, and aquaculture, and it is also significantly
important to determine the underwater topography and
movement of sediments and to generate hydrographic
charts for safe transportation. Moreover, in the port, main-
taining the depth of man-made channel throughout the
year is important for the smooth navigation of large ships.
Typically, the measurement of ocean depth is done
using conventional methods such as pre-measured rope
or cable passage, placed on the side of the vessel and
allowed to reach the seabed (Doxani et al., 2012). This
method can retrieve the depth of a single point in time.
This method was rapidly replaced by hydrographic ships
carrying echo sounder instruments such as single-beam
and multi-beam echo sounders. The echo-sounding
method is capable of determining the depth accurately
over clear water coastal environment, whereas in turbid
water, the method lacks performance due to infiltration of
sound waves to the bottom of the ocean. Generally, the
speed of ship constrains the surveyors to map the ocean
region at a slightly different scale than the desired scale.
It is to be noted that the method would take 200years of
survey time to complete swath survey of deep ocean, and
it would take even more time for shallow coastal areas
(Carron et al., 2001).
In order to overcome this inefficiency, various airborne
laser bathymetric (ALB) and light detection and ranging
(LiDAR) systems such as scanning hydrographic opera-
tional airborne lidar survey (SHOLAS), compact hydro-
graphic airborne rapid total survey (CHARTS), laser
airborne depth sounder (LADS), and experimental
advanced airborne research lidar (EAARL) were estab-
lished to infer the bathymetry of oceans. This method can
effectively determine the depth of both shallow and clear

Abstract
Determining the bathymetry of ocean is important for many aspects such as generating navigational charts, to study
changes in the seafloor profile, sea level rise, and beach erosion. Traditionally, the bathymetry of ocean was determined
by a hydrographic ship carrying an echo sounder instrument which was cost effective but time consuming and also often
inaccessible in shallow water regions. The alternate solution to infer the bathymetry of ocean is remote sensing technology.
The multispectral satellite platform such as Ikonos and WorldView images are commercially available, whereas the Landsat-8
imagery is freely accessible and therefore the Landsat-8 imagery is used. In this study, the first objective was to evolve a
procedure to determine the bathymetry of ocean using the ratio transform algorithm. The second objective was to find the
effectiveness of improving the spatial resolution of Landsat-8 imagery to estimate the bathymetry of ocean, and the results
of both before and after improving the spatial resolution are compared. The statistical indices, root mean square error and
mean absolute error, are computed between the algorithm results and the reference hydrographic chart values, and it was
found that the improved spatial resolution of Landsat-8 imagery provided better estimation up to 10m depth.

water coastal environment, but this technique is limited by
its high purchasing and maintenance costs.
Almost all of the above methods take a long interval
of time to revisit the same location and thus it is difficult
to monitor the frequent changes of seabed morphology.
It is very difficult to infer the bathymetry of shallow
water region, as those areas are inflexible to access by
hydrographic ships carrying echo-sounding instruments.
Accurate estimation of bathymetry of shallow water
region is important for the navigation safety of small
boats like fishing and for benthic studies (Ma et al.,
2014). Remote sensing technology can be regarded
as one of the most promising alternative tools to map
the bathymetry of shallow water regions by pairing
remote sensing data with ground-based measurements
(Winterbottom and Gilvear, 1997). Remote sensing tech-
nology has various advantages such as wide coverage of
area, repetivity of the area over certain period of time,
and also easy access of data. Therefore, this technology
provides a fast solution to map bathymetry of the region,
where rapid change of coastal environment is observed
(Deng et al., 2008).
Bathymetry mapping using remote sensing technology
is attained from the principle in which the total amount of
electromagnetic energy observed and reflected from the
water body determines the water depth. The remote sens-
ing technique is available to determine the depth of ocean,
for the reason that the water attenuates signal from the bot-
tommost part of ocean with a strong wavelength depend-
ency (Dekker et al., 2011). However, penetration of
electromagnetic wave energy is limited. Therefore, remote
sensing technique is primarily adopted to infer the depth of
clear and shallow water region (Zheng et al., 2014).
The two important approaches such as analytical
method and empirical method are adopted to retrieve the
bathymetry of ocean using satellite image. A number of
analytical algorithms are available in the literature, which
are proposed by Lyzenga (1978, 1981), Lyzenga et al.
(2006), and Philpot (1989). In order to use the analytical
method for mapping the bathymetry of ocean, a number of
input parameters such as water column, properties of
atmosphere and bottom reflectance, and spectral signa-
tures of suspended and dissolved materials are required
(Spitzer and Dirks, 1986). Although the analytical method
is moderately complex and difficult, it has been adopted by
Mobley et al. (2005), Brando et al. (2009), and Giardino
et al. (2012). On the other hand, the empirical method
establishes the relationship between the remotely sensed
radiance of a water body and the depth at sampled loca-
tions is established empirically without regard to how light
is transmitted in water (Gao, 2009). In comparison, empir-
ical method requires only few parameters as input which
are simple and do not require water column parameters.
However, for the calibration function, the method requires
hydrographically measured data.
A number of empirical algorithms are proposed to
retrieve the bathymetry of ocean, among which the most
commonly used algorithm is the ratio transform algorithm
developed by Stumpf et al. (2003). The ratio transform
algorithm operates by the mixture of two bands (blue and
green) to detach the difference in depth from difference in
bottom albedo. The algorithm works on the principle that
the observance of water differs from band to band when
the depth of water increases. Generally, the spectral band
of green is high in absorptivity, in which the reflected irra-
diance declines quicker than in the low absorptivity of blue
band (Pe'eri et al., 2014). Therefore, the ratio between the
green and blue bands declines linearly with penetration,
when they are log transformed. It is important to note that
both bands are affected similarly with the changes in the
bottom albedo, but the high absorption band green is
affected more when the depth varies.
The mapping of bathymetry in the clear ocean water is
successfully mapped up to the depth of 25­30m by adopting
the remote sensing technique (Eugenio et al., 2015; Lyzenga
et al., 2006; Mishra et al., 2007). To determine the depth of
ocean and marine water environment, the blue and green
bands (visible bands) of spectrum wavelength are selected for
remotely sensing bathymetry. In the visible bands, light infil-
trates the water column, an exponential attenuation of radi-
ance as a function of both depth and wavelength, and delivers
the primary principle for estimating the depth (Gao, 2009).
Some of the important literatures for estimating the
bathymetry of ocean using remote sensing technology are
discussed below.
Vahtmäe and Kutser (2016) investigated linear band
model and the log-transformed band ratio model for deter-
mining the bathymetry of optically complex Baltic Sea
region using airborne HySpex hyperspectral images. The
results of both the models are compared by the statistical
indices of R2 and root mean square error (RMSE). The
values of these indices indicate that the linear band model
is outperformed by the log-transformed band ratio model
by accurately estimating the depth of 4
m. The log trans-
form model provides inaccurate results for the reason of
high albedo in the near-coastal regions.
Eugenio et al. (2015) implemented the multichannel
physical s-based algorithm to determine the bathymetry
of Granadilla de Abona (Tenerife Island) and Corralejo
(Fuerteventura Island) areas using WorldView-2 imagery. In
order to retrieve the depth accurately, the physical s-based
algorithm is coupled with radiative transfer model. The cou-
pled model estimates the depth effectively up to 25m. The
model declines the prediction of depth greater than 25m.
Su et al. (2014) used a geographically adaptive inversion
and conventional global inversion model to estimate the bot-
tom depth over Kauai and Barbuda Islands using high-
resolution Ikonos and Landsat ETM+ satellite imagery.
The performance of conventional global inversion model is
limited, when the bottom type and water quality vary
Pushparaj and Hegde 73
spatially within the scene. The geographically adaptive
inversion model divides the image scene into local areas to
calibrate the inversion models for each submission to
improve the accuracy and reliability of retrieving the bathym-
etry from remote sensing imagery. It is demonstrated that the
geographically adaptive inversion model estimates the
bathymetry better than the conventional model.
Su et al. (2008) developed an automated method for
calibrating the parameters for a non-linear inversion model
based on the Levenberg­Marquardt optimization algo-
rithm for determining the bathymetry of south shore of
Molokai Island, Hawaii, using Ikonos satellite imagery.
Depth data derived from the non-linear inversion model
are compared with the conventional log-linear inversion
model. It is observed that the overall performance of both
the models is similar. The non-linear inversion model pro-
duced slightly better and accurate estimation of deeper
depth of 10­15m, but slightly less accurate for very shal-
low regions (i.e. <5m).
The following literature represents the estimation of
bathymetry along the coast of India.
Pattanaik et al. (2015) used a simple radioactive model
and a linear radioactive model for estimating the depth
along the coast of Odisha, India, using Indian Remote
Sensing (IRS) Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor
(LISS-III) multispectral imagery. The statistical index R2
is calculated to compare the result of two models. The
index value indicates that the linear radioactive model
outperformed the simple radioactive model. However,
both the methods are very effective to determine the depth
of 4­5m.
The common errors associated while estimating the
depth from remote sensing images are as follows: first,
error may be presented in the reference bathymetry data
set (i.e. ground data). Second, water turbidity is one of the
most significant factors which decline the accuracy of
remotely sensed bathymetry. Third, the existence of sub-
merged vegetation canopies in the study area also affects
the accuracy of remotely sensed bathymetry.
The first objective of this study was to evolve a proce-
dure based on ratio transform algorithm for estimating the
bathymetry of near shore along the Mangaluru coast of
Karnataka, India, using Landsat-8 imagery. The second
was to adopt the same procedure to find the effectiveness
of improving the spatial resolution of Landsat-8 imagery.
The coefficient of determination R2 is calculated between
the pixel value and the reference hydrographic data which
identifies the extinction of depth. The results of both before
and after improving the spatial resolution are compared.
Materials and methodology
Study area
The coastal region of Dakshina Kannada district of
Karnataka state, India, stretches from Talapady in the
south to Baindur in the north over a distance of about
140km. The region is enclosed by the Arabian Sea on the
west and the Western Ghats on the east. Generally, the
coast of Dakshina Kannada adores the tropical hot mon-
soon climate due to its latitudinal position. The coast is
influenced by the southwest monsoon which receives
heavy rainfall during the months from June to September,
ranging from 3000 to 3900
mm. The coast experiences
high temperature throughout the year with relatively con-
stant high humidity. During the monsoon period, wave
height of 6.5
m is recorded along the coast of Dakshina
Kannada, and in the non-monsoon period, the height of
wave is less than 1m.
The present study area covers a total length of 25
km
(approximately), extending from Ullal region in the south
to Surathkal in the north, roughly (12°510S 74°500E)
shown in Figure 1. Mangaluru is the major city in the coast
of Dakshina Kannada and gains economic importance due
to urbanization and industrialization. The Netravathi and
Gurpur rivers originate from the Western Ghats and flows
westward and takes a right angle bend near the coast and
then flow either northward or southward close to and par-
allel to the coast. These rivers join together at some point
before they merge into the Arabian Sea. The study area
along the coast of Mangaluru covers the range of depth up
to 25
m and also encompasses the New Mangalore Port
Trust (NMPT).
Methodology
The important steps for determining the bathymetry of
near-shore ocean along the coast of Mangaluru using
Landsat-8 imagery are shown in Figure 2.
First, the procedure is adopted on the original imagery
of Landsat-8. Second, the same procedure is adopted on
the Landsat-8 imagery after improving spatial resolution.
Third, range of depth obtained from the original and after
improving spatial resolution of Landsat-8 imagery is
compared.
Bathymetry from space
Generally, the bathymetry of ocean is surveyed by ships
carrying echo sounders.
Although most of the areas are unexplored due to the
complications of transporting the ship to the deep ocean,
estimating the bathymetry by ship is cost effective.
The remote sensing­based technique has advantages in
comparison with the present echo sounder technique. The
remote sensing technique absorbs the globe with uniform
resolution, and repetivity of collecting data over the same
area helps to monitor changes in the bathymetry of ocean.
There are several commercially available multispectral
satellite data acquired through Ikonos and WorldView,
which can be used to determine the bathymetry of ocean.
74 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(2)
However, the Landsat-8 satellite imagery is available
freely in the open domain. Hence, Landsat-8 imagery is
utilized for determining the bathymetry of near-shore
ocean. The Landsat-8 imagery used for this study is down-
loaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS)
website, acquired on 13 March 2014. The Landsat-8 satel-
lite acquires total of 11 bands, including blue and green
with the spatial resolution of 30m and panchromatic (pan)
band with the spatial resolution of 15m.
For this study, blue, green, and near-infrared (NIR)
bands of Landsat-8 imagery are used. The spatial resolu-
tion of blue, green, and NIR bands is 30m. The reason for
applying the blue and green bands in the coastal environ-
ment is that the radiance in the blue band (450­515
nm)
decreases more rapidly with depth than radiance in the
green band (525­600nm). Generally, light at wavelengths
above 700
nm has a very low transmittance in sea water.
Therefore, water appears dark and the land appears bright.
For this reason, the NIR band (845­885
nm) is used for
distinguishing water from land.
The bathymetry of near-shore ocean is estimated using
the blue and green band pair, and most importantly,
hydrographic chart of the same area is acquired on 18
March 2014. The acquisition dates of both satellite image
and hydrographic chart are close to each other. Therefore,
both the data are co-registered correctly and used for the
estimation of bathymetry. The hydrographic chart repre-
sents the ground data with respect to the chart datum. The
depth soundings of hydrographic chart were used to ref-
erence the satellite-derived bathymetry to the chart
datum. To perform the ratio transform algorithm, the gain
and offset (i.e. m0
and m1
) values are computed from the
soundings (i.e. hydrographic chart), which are used as
control points for the algorithm results. During the satel-
lite image acquisition, instant water level is very unlikely
to correspond with the chart datum (e.g. mean lower low
water (MLLW) or lowest astronomical tide (LAT)), and
the measurement of tide height during the acquisition of
satellite image is not needed because it is automatically
accounted for using the control points which are selected
from a hydrographic chart to define the transformation
parameters. Generally, the water levels over small spatial
magnitude are normally well approximated as a vertical
offset and do not harm the linear relationship between the
hydrographic chart soundings and the algorithm results.
Thus, the procedure excludes the need for tide-corrected
satellite imagery and for tide correctors (Pe'eri et al.,
2014).
Spatial filtering
Before performing spatial filtering, technique float is per-
formed to convert each pixel of satellite image into a float-
ing point representation. Later, a spatial filtering technique
called low-pass filter (kernel size of 5
×
5) is applied on
the blue, green, and NIR bands of Landsat-8 imagery to
remove the speckle noise.

Water separation
It is important to separate land from water to estimate the
bathymetry of ocean. For this purpose, band NIR is used
due to the appearance of water in dark and land in bright.
Here, the land/water threshold value is obtained by draw-
ing a line that crosses from land (bright areas) into the
water (dark areas). The obtained threshold value is applied
on the blue and green bands of Landsat-8 imagery to sepa-
rate land from water.
Glint and cloud correction
This step is intended to correct the radiometric contribu-
tion from sun glint and low clouds; the method proposed
by Hedley et al. (2005) is performed to rectify the radio-
metric correction on blue and green bands. The linear rela-
tionship between the NIR and visible bands (i.e. green and
blue) is established using the linear regression, based on a
selected sample area of the image pixels. Following the
recommendation of Hochberg et al. (2003), sample region
of image is selected which is evident of sun glint, but the
spectral brightness of the selected region is expected to be
consistent, wherein the region of deep water is ultimate for
this. The equation for removing the sun glint and low
clouds is shown below

sun glint­corrected pixel
brightness in blue and green bands. The value of MinNIR
indicates the pixel brightness of NIR with no sun glint, and
can be assessed by the minimum NIR value, which is
found in the regression sample. Generally, the minimum
NIR pixel is less prone to problematic outliers than the
maximum NIR pixel. The following steps are implemented
to remove the radiometric correction on blue and green
bands (Hedley et al., 2005):
·
· Select the sample area where the range of sun glint is
evident. It is important to note that the image might
be more or less homogeneous, and if the sun glint
was not present (in deep water), then estimate the
minimum NIR brightness MinNIR
in the sample.

(y-axis). And determine the slope of the

(for all pix-
els in the image), subtract the outcome of bi
and the
NIR brightness of the pixel minus MinNIR
from the

Ratio transform algorithm
A ratio transform algorithm was proposed by Stumpf et al.
(2003) to estimate the bathymetry of near-shore ocean.
The algorithm makes use of two bands in order to reduce
the number of parameters to infer the depth of ocean. It
decreases the bottommost radiance of one band more rap-
idly with respect to depth, when compared to another band.
This leads to the ratio between the two bands to differ with
respect to the depth. A near-constant attenuation value will
be preserved between the ratio of two bands which is noth-
ing but the difference of the diffuse attenuation coefficient
at two different wavelengths; just depending on notion that
water column is uniformly mixed. The algorithm can cut
down the error coupled with varying radiation in the
atmosphere, water column, and seafloor, for the reason
that both bands are distributed equally.
Typically in the coastal environment, radiance in the
blue wavelength (400­500
nm) attenuates faster with
depth than light in the green wavelength (500­600
nm)
(Jerlov, 1976). Thus, the variation in ratio between the
bands is affected further by the depth than by bottom
reflectance. To infer the bathymetry, the algorithm estab-
lishes the linear relationship between the ratio of radi-
ance in two bands (green and blue) and water depth
(Stumpf et al., 2003). The algorithm relies on the circum-
stance that the absorptivity of water differs spectrally
from band to band. As the depth of water increases,
reflectance values of the band with higher absorption will
decrease proportionately faster than reflectance value of
the band with lower absorption. Therefore, when two
bands are transformed, there exists a linear decrease
between a ratio of high absorption band to a low absorp-
tion band and water depth.

it takes very few parameters and does not require any opti-
cal properties to determine the depth of ocean.
Identifying the extinction depth
The statistical analysis R2 (the coefficient of determina-
tion) is adopted to estimate the extinction of depth. The
parameters such as m1
and m0
are obtained from the anal-
ysis of coefficient of determination. The R2 closest to 1
indicates that there exists a linear relationship between the
pixel value and the reference hydrographic chart datum.

does not show clear correlation.
Finally, the calculated parameter such as observed radi-
ance of band from the ratio of blue and green and the val-
ues of m1

are provided as input to the ratio
transform algorithm and identified the depth along the
near-shore ocean of Mangaluru coast, Karnataka. The
above procedure for estimating the bathymetry is pro-
cessed using the ArcGIS 10.2 environment.
Improving the spatial resolution of Landsat-8
imagery
In order to improve the spatial resolution of satellite image,
various image fusion methods are proposed, such as prin-
cipal component analysis (PCA) (Chavez and Kwarteng,
1989), modified intensity hue saturation (M-IHS)
(Siddiqui, 2003), Brovey transform (BT) (Hallada and
Cox, 1983), high-pass filter (HPF) (Chavez et al., 1991),
and wavelet coupled with IHS and PCA (Gonzalez-
Audicana et al., 2005; Ranchin and Wald, 1993). Image
fusion is the process of transferring high spatial resolution
of pan image to the multispectral image in order to obtain
a single image with both high spatial and high spectral
resolution. The important conditions for fusing the satellite
image are (1) both pan band and multispectral band should
cover the same area and should be acquired at the same
time and (2) wavelength range of pan band and multispec-
tral band should be close to each other. Here, the wave-
length ranges of blue (0.450­0.515
µm) and green
(0.525­0.600µm) bands are close to the wavelength range
of pan (0.500­0.680µm).
Therefore, the original blue and green bands with the
spatial resolution of 30m are fused separately with the pan
band of 15-m spatial resolution. Improved spatial resolu-
tion of blue and green bands is obtained using the HPF
image fusion method as shown in Figure 3(a) and (b).
HPF
The only pan-sharpening HPF tool (ERDAS Imagine 2014
software) provides single-band fusion option. Therefore,
the HPF method has been used for fusing the pan band
with blue and green bands individually. The method com-
putes the ratio R between the spatial size of the pan and
blue and also pan and green bands. The kernel size of 5×5
is used based on the suggestion in the ERDAS software
manual as the ratio of multispectral band to pan band reso-
lution is <2.5. A small HPF is placed on the pan band, and
the pixel size of the blue and green bands is resampled to
that of the high-pass pan band. The filtered high-pass pan
band is added to the resampled blue and green bands to
obtain a merged blue and green band with both high spatial
and rich spectral information.
After improving spatial resolution, it is important to
assess the quality of blue and green bands, before it is used
for estimating the bathymetry of near-shore ocean. The
quantitative index, spatial correlation coefficient (SCC)
(Choi, 2006; Zhou et al., 1998), is used to assess the spatial
quality of blue and green bands (i.e. improved spatial reso-
lution). In order to process this index, the reference blue
and green band with the spatial resolution of pan band is
needed, but in reality it is difficult to obtain the blue and
green band with this requirement. Nevertheless, a refer-
ence image can be obtained by resampling the original
blue and green bands to the size of the pan band
(Gangkofner et al., 2008). The index value of SCC close to
1 indicates that the bands have good spatial quality.
Here, the value of SCC for the blue band is 0.8995 and
for the green band is 0.8815, which is close to the original
value of 1. Therefore, the HPF method generates improved
spatial resolution of blue and green bands with high spatial
quality. The HPF method is processed using the ERDAS
2014 software based on the suggestions in the software
manual and also on the basis of existing literature, and the
spatial quality of fused image is assessed using MATLAB
2015b. The improved spatial resolution of blue and green
bands is used to estimate the bathymetry of near-shore
ocean by applying the above procedure. The extinction of

Results and discussion
In this study, a procedure was evolved to estimate the
bathymetry of near-shore ocean using the Landsat-8 satel-
lite imagery. The results of the procedure implemented are
presented in Figures 4 to 14. It is important to pre-process
the satellite image before estimating the near-shore
bathymetry. Therefore, the low-pass filter is applied on the
blue, green, and NIR bands as shown in Figure 4(a) to (c),
respectively. To separate the land from water, the threshold
value is estimated from the NIR band as shown in Figure
5, which indicates the smooth section with low values rep-
resenting water, whereas the fluctuating high values
represent land. Thus, the threshold value 7000 is applied
on the blue and green bands to separate water from land as
shown in Figure 6(a) and (b).
In order to remove the silver glint, Hedley et al.'s (2005)
method is adopted.
First, the polygon is drawn which covers only the
water area (from the recommendations of Hochberg
et al., 2003, areas of deep water are ideal for this). The
polygon is created over the NIR band (i.e. band contains
both dark (water) and bright (land) areas). The extracted
polygon covers only the water area and is next used to
extract the water body of the blue and green bands, as
shown in Figure 7(a) and (b).

Second, linear regression is established for all the
selected areas of each visible band against the NIR band,
as shown in Figure 8(a) for blue band and Figure 8(b) for
green band, where x-axis represents the NIR band bright-
ness and y-axis represents the visible band. To remove the
sun glint and cloud, the parameters such as Ri
, bi
, RNIR
,
and MinNIR
are needed. Ri
is the pixel value in the corre-
sponding blue and green bands, and the regression slope
bi
is calculated for the blue and green bands using the fol-
lowing equation

where the values of x1
, x2
, y1
, y2
, and MinNIR
(pixel
brightness of NIR) are obtained from Figure 8(a) for blue
band and Figure 8(b) for green band. RNIR
is the pixel
value of NIR band. Consequently, the removal of sun glint
of blue and green bands is shown in Figure 9(a) and (b).
The ratio transform algorithm is adopted on the pre-
processed blue and green bands and estimates the bathym-
etry of near-shore ocean. The hydrographic chart used as a
reference depth which is overlaid on the outcome of
ln( ( )) / ln( ( ))
L Band L Band
obs blue obs green
(i.e. named as
bathy image) is shown in Figure 10(a) and (b). It is impor-
tant to note that the hydrographic chart is prepared using
the in situ data collected using multi-beam echo sounders,
and it is corrected to MLLW. The pixel value of the bathy
image is obtained with the reference of hydrographic chart
value, and so there is no need to measure the tidal height
during the image acquisition.
From Figure 10(b), depth points in the hydrographic
chart and the corresponding pixel values from the bathy
image are obtained, and the scatter plot is plotted which is
shown in Figures 11 and 12, in which x-axis represents the
hydrographic chart depth and y-axis represents the corre-
sponding pixel value. To estimate the bathymetry of near-
shore ocean using ratio transform algorithm, certain
parameters are required, such as Lobs
, m1
, and m0
, where
Lobs
is observed radiance of bands, obtained from the ratio
of blue and green bands which is shown in Figure 10(a),
and m1
and m0
are obtained empirically by correlating the
corresponding pixel value to the hydrographic chart value
(Figures 11 and 12).
The effectiveness of improving the spatial resolution of
Landsat-8 imagery for determining the bathymetry of near-
shore ocean is examined by comparing the results of both

green band.

and (b) green to determine the MinNIR

before improving the spatial resolution of 30
m and after
improving the spatial resolution of 15
m. To validate the
ratio transform algorithm, the statistical indices such as
RMSE and mean absolute error (MAE) are computed
between the algorithm results and hydrographic chart depth.
Figure 11 represents the result of estimating the bathym-
etry of near-shore ocean before improving the spatial reso-
lution of satellite image (i.e. 30m), where the top portion
of the image shows the scatter plot of the corresponding
pixel value against the hydrographic chart depth, which
indicates good correlation value of R2=0.8503 for depth
up to 5m. It is also seen that the value of R2=0.5132 for
the depth from 5 to 16m indicates that the corresponding
pixel moderately matches the hydrographic chart depth,
and the value of R2=0.3943 for the depth from 16 to 25m

indicates that the pixel value and hydrographic chart depth
do not match.
The bottom portion of the image explains the pixel
value and its relation to the depth of extinction. Areas
deeper than the extinction depth (i.e. 5
m) do not have a
good correlation between the pixel value and the reference
hydrographic chart depth. Therefore, the ratio transform
algorithm can retrieve the depth up to 5m for the 30m spa-
tial resolution of Landsat-8 imagery.
Figure 12 represents the result of estimating the bathym-
etry of near-shore ocean (i.e. after improving the spatial
resolution of satellite image to 15m), where the top portion
of the image shows the scatter plot of the corresponding
pixel value against the hydrographic chart depth which indi-
cates the good correlation value of R2=0.8951 for the depth
up to 10m. It is also seen that the value of R2=0.6214 for the
depth from 10 to 16m indicates that the pixel value moder-
ately matches the hydrographic chart depth, and the value of
R2=0.4512 for the depth from 16 to 25m indicates that the
pixel value and hydrographic chart depth matches unlikely.
The bottom portion of the image explains that the areas
deeper than the extinction depth 10m do not have a good
correlation between the pixel value and the reference
hydrographic chart depth. Therefore, it is evident that
improving the spatial resolution of satellite image helps to
determine the higher depth.
The required parameters such as Lobs
(obtained from
the ratio of blue and green bands) and m1
and m0
(obtained
empirically by correlating the corresponding pixel value to
the hydrographic chart value) are provided as input to the
ratio transform algorithm and depth ( )
z is obtained. In
order to validate the ratio transform algorithm, statistical
indices RMSE and MAE are calculated between the algo-
rithm results and the reference hydrographic chart as
shown in Tables 1 and 2.
Table 1 indicates that the range of depths between 0 and
5 has higher accuracy (RMSE=0.94; MAE=0.89). From
Table 2, it is observed that the highest accuracy
(RMSE
=
0.86; MAE
=
0.79) is achieved for the range of
depths between 0 and 10. It is seen that the ratio transform
algorithm tends to underestimate the depths in water
deeper than 10m. Therefore, the ratio transform algorithm
can better estimate the depth up to 10m for the improved
spatial resolution of Landsat-8 imagery.

resolution.

Figures 13 and 14 represent the estimation of bathym-
etry before and after improving the spatial resolution of
satellite image along the coast of Mangaluru, Karnataka.
The Landsat-8 image with the spatial resolution of 30m
(i.e. before improving the spatial resolution) provided bet-
ter estimation of depth up to 5
m, which is indicated in
light blue and shown in Figure 13, the depth from 5 to 16m
is shown in blue, and the depth from 16 to 25m is shown
in dark blue in which the algorithm results and hydro-
graphic chart depth do not match. Therefore, the Landsat-8
image with spatial resolution of 30m better estimates the
depth up to 5m.
The Landsat-8 image with the spatial resolution of 15m
(i.e. after improving the spatial resolution) provided the
better estimation of depth up to 10m (which is colored in
light blue) is shown in Figure 14, the depth from 10 to
16
m is shown in blue, and the depth from 16 to 25
m is
shown in dark blue indicates that the algorithm results and
hydrographic chart depth do not match. Therefore, the
Landsat-8 image with improved spatial resolution of 15m
better estimates the depth up to 10m.
Conclusion
·
· In this study, the procedure is evolved for estimat-
ing near-shore bathymetry using Landsat-8 satellite
imagery based on the ratio transform algorithm. In
effect, this procedure can be best used as an explo-
ration tool to infer the bathymetry of coastal region
before a high-resolution hydrographic survey is
operated using an expensive instrument such as
multi-beam echo sounder.
·
· The results of satellite image show a good correla-
tion of R2=0.8503 with the hydrographic chart data
for the depth up to 5m for the 30-m spatial resolu-
tion of Landsat-8 imagery.
·
· The results of satellite image after improving the
spatial resolution to 15
m show a good correlation
of R2=0.8951 with the hydrographic chart data for
the depth up to 10m. Therefore, improving the spa-
tial resolution helps to infer the higher depth in the
region of coast.
·
· The results of RMSE and MAE between the algo-
rithm results and hydrographic chart indicate that
the ratio transform algorithm can better estimate the
depth up to 10m for the improved spatial resolution
of Landsat-8 imagery.
·
· The procedure used for deriving the satellite
bathymetry can be used by marine surveyors and
hydrographic officers. Using the results of this
procedure, marine surveyors can assess the cur-
rent amount of change in depth, and if a weaker
R2 value is observed, it necessitates the update of
high-resolution hydrographic chart to the exist-
ing one.
·
· To derive the bathymetry using the satellite
imagery, environmental conditions such as water
clarity, cloud cover, and sun glint are needed to be
considered that could deteriorate the accuracy of
estimated depth.
·
· It is also to be noted that the selection of reference
hydrographic chart is important due to the age of
the hydrographic survey or the old technique and
equipment used to conduct the survey.
·
· Finally, regardless of improvement in the satellite-
derived bathymetry, the procedure evolved can be
used as an exploration tool for operating the hydro-
graphic survey, and this is not an alternative for
acoustic hydrographic survey.
