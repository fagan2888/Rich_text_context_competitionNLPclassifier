Abstract: Two studies examined the mechanisms underlying North American women's
previously documented attraction to men displaying the nonverbal expression of shame
(Tracy and Beall, 2011). In Study 1, American women at high-conception risk were found
to be less attracted to men displaying shame compared to women at low-conception risk,
suggesting that male shame displays indicate poor genetic fitness. In Study 2, Indian
women were found to be less attracted to men displaying shame than American women,
suggesting that American women's tendency to find shame-displaying men attractive is
likely due to local socio-cultural factors rather than to universal genetically encoded
predispositions. Together, findings suggest that the attractiveness of male shame displays,
previously documented in several North American samples, is best explained by cultural
rather than biological factors.

Introduction
Nonverbal expressions of emotion are often perceived as conveying trait
information about social group members (Knutson, 1996). For example, displays of anger
increase perceptions of dominance, whereas displays of fear and surprise reduce such
inferences (Knutson, 1996; Marsh, Ambady, and Kleck, 2005; Montepare and Dobish,
2003). By quickly communicating socially relevant information about interactants'
personalities and behavioral tendencies, these expressions facilitate the smooth functioning
of social interactions and relationships.
One interpersonal domain in which individuals typically seek to acquire as much
information as possible about others, and often without directly asking, is that of mate
choice. When choosing a romantic partner, individuals prioritize certain dispositional traits
and seek mates who exhibit these desired qualities, which, as a result, are perceived as
increasing a target's sexual attractiveness (Li and Kenrick, 2006). For example, individuals

tend to seek out--and find attractive--mates who exhibit gender dimorphic qualities (i.e.,
traits perceived as indicating masculinity or femininity; Buss, 2008; see also Rhodes,
2006). Evolutionary mating theory suggests that these desired characteristics are likely to
have conferred genetic fitness advantages to their possessors (or their possessors'
offspring) in ancestral environments, and thus increase possessors' mate value (see Buss,
2008). As a result, it is adaptive for women be attracted to opposite-sex partners who
exhibit traits such as social dominance, and for men to be attracted to opposite-sex partners
who exhibit traits such as youth, amiability, and receptivity to sexual relationships (e.g.,
Buss, 2008). In a similar manner, emotion expressions that communicate dispositional
information relevant to an expresser's mate value (e.g., dominance, approachability) might
be expected to influence expressers' perceived attractiveness.
Supporting this expectation, a recent series of studies found that distinct emotion
expressions have large and gender-divergent effects on perceived attractiveness (Tracy and
Beall, 2011). The emotions examined in this prior research were happiness, pride, and
shame--all thought to communicate information relevant to mate value. Though
participants in these studies were not asked to report specific reasons for their attraction to
the emotion expressions examined, findings were largely consistent with evolutionary
explanations of mate choice. Specifically, happiness--an emotion that conveys femininity
and sexual receptivity (Brown et al., 1986; Hareli, Shomrat, and Hess, 2009)--was judged
to be highly attractive when displayed by women, but considerably less so when displayed
by men. Pride displays, in contrast, increased the relative attractiveness of men more than
women, consistent with the pride display's cross-cultural associations with high-status
(Shariff and Tracy, 2009; Shariff, Tracy, and Markusoff, 2012; Tiedens, Ellsworth, and
Mesquita, 2000; Tracy, Shariff, Zhao, and Henrich, 2013) and its prototypical features of
expanded chest and generally large appearance, known to increase masculinity and male
attractiveness (Li and Kenrick, 2006). In addition, female shame displays were judged as
less attractive than female happy displays but more attractive than female pride and neutral
displays, consistent with the assumption that shame's submissiveness connotations increase
displayers' apparent approachability, and thus the attractiveness of shame-displaying
women.
In contrast to these findings, which fit with evolutionarily derived theoretical
expectations, results that emerged regarding the attractiveness of male shame displays were
more unexpected. Men displaying shame were judged as more attractive than men
displaying other emotions. Specifically, across samples ranging broadly in age and
ethnicity, shame-displaying men were rated as equally or more attractive than men
displaying neutrality or happiness, and only slightly less attractive than men displaying
pride. This pattern of results was observed first in a study that asked participants to view
and rate the attractiveness of one opposite-sex person displaying, in a photo, one of the four
expressions, and, second, in a study in which three different samples of participants viewed
and rated the sexual attractiveness of either 40 or 80 different opposite-sex targets, each
displaying one of the four expressions (such that, across participants, there were 30
different versions of each emotion expression viewed in total; Tracy and Beall, 2011).
This well-replicated finding is surprising because shame is known to convey low-
status (Shariff and Tracy, 2009; Shariff, Tracy, and Markusoff, 2012), and women tend to
view status as an important characteristic when evaluating the attractiveness of a potential
partner (Li and Kenrick, 2006). Communicating status information through emotional
The puzzling attractiveness of male shame

expressions would have been adaptive in humans' status-driven ancestral societies, as such
messages can help establish and solidify one's position within the social hierarchy
(Martens, Tracy, and Shariff, 2012). By conveying one's high status, the pride expression,
for example, may benefit displayers by informing others that he or she should receive
deference (Shariff and Tracy, 2009). Correspondingly, observers of pride displays might
benefit by acquiring information about which group members are likely to make good
leaders, or which members are particularly knowledgeable or skilled and thus should be
copied or followed (Martens and Tracy, 2013). In contrast, by signaling low status, shame
displays should function to communicate poorer genetic fitness. As a result, evolutionary
theory would predict that men who show shame should be perceived by women as less
attractive.
However, in addition to its low-status message, shame communicates other trait
information, which might indicate higher mate value: trustworthiness and a respect for
social norms. Shame displays may have originated as a human form of the more ancient
submission displays seen across a wide range of primate species, which function to appease
conspecifics by signaling the displayer's awareness of others' relatively greater power or
dominance (Fessler, 2007; Keltner, Young, and Buswell, 1997; Martens et al., 2012).
Throughout humans' evolutionary history, the failure to accede to a stronger or otherwise
more powerful adversary would have major costs, including survival (MacLean, 1990), so
it makes sense that humans would have evolved to show an appeasing expression like
shame in such situations.
Over time, the shame-submission display likely shifted toward a response to failure
or social transgression (common shame-eliciting situations; Lewis, Alessandri, and
Sullivan, 1992); in these situations, the display would serve the same appeasing function by
communicating the transgressor's recognition of his or her violation and regret for it. This
message would likely help avert punishment for the transgression. Eventually, the shame
display may have come to convey not only regret for the violation of a social norm, but also
one's respect for the norm that was violated (Keltner et al., 1997), and perhaps even a
general tendency to respect social norms, broadly speaking. Though it seems somewhat
counterintuitive that shame displays might communicate both acceptance of norms and also
that an individual has broken a norm, there is good reason to think that this is exactly the
complicated message shame evolved to send. In many cultures, displaying shame is
considered to be an important way of demonstrating one's commitment to the group, and of
protecting a transgressor from overly negative social appraisals and retribution following a
transgression (Haidt and Keltner, 1999; Keltner et al., 1997). The theoretical rationale for
this account is that all humans make occasional social transgressions or suffer failures, but
expressing shame allows them to demonstrate their awareness that these behaviors are
trespasses. The real threat to group harmony, in this view, is the individual who does not
show shame.
Based on this account, displays of shame may signal not only that the individual is
low in status and has corresponding poor mate value, but also that he or she respects the
local social norms and thus can be trusted--a message that should indicate high mate value.
This latter message may be what accounts for the prior evidence suggesting that women are
attracted to men who display shame (Tracy and Beall, 2011).
Thus far, we have suggested that attractiveness judgments are guided by evolved
mating strategies (Buss, 1987). However, the impact of these strategies on mating behavior
The puzzling attractiveness of male shame

is expected to vary depending on social and cultural factors (Tovee, Swami, Furnham, and
Mangalparsad, 2006). That is, the functioning of even evolved psychological mechanisms
is sensitive to variations in local ecologies (Tooby and Cosmides, 1992), and we would
expect mate preferences based on dispositional qualities to be subject to differences in
cultural norms and practices. For example, Li, Valentine, and Patel (2010) found that
although women across cultures value similar personality traits in potential male partners,
Singaporean women place higher value on certain traits, such as a man's social status,
compared to American women.
Given the complexity of messages communicated by shame--both low-status and
high respect for social norms and trustworthiness--this expression may be particularly
likely to be judged differently in different cultural contexts, depending on the relative value
assigned to these two messages. The prior findings demonstrating the attractiveness of male
shame emerged from studies conducted on several samples of women, ranging broadly in
age. However, all these women were from North American populations, raising the
question of whether this effect would generalize to cultural contexts where women place a
relatively higher value on a man's social status, or a lower value on his respect for social
norms or trustworthiness.
In the present research, we sought to understand the puzzling attractiveness of male
shame by asking two questions: (1) Do male shame displays communicate genetic fitness,
or high mate value (i.e., are male shame displays most attractive to women who are most
likely to benefit reproductively from mating with shame displayers?); and (2) To what
extent does the attractiveness of male shame vary across populations that hold different
values regarding shame and the messages it sends?
To address these questions, we used two methodological approaches. In our first
study, we adopted the conception-risk assessment approach. A growing body of evidence
indicates that women's sexual preferences vary across the menstrual cycle, such that
women are most attentive to markers of "good genes" in potential mates when conception
is most likely--that is, the days immediately preceding and during ovulation (Baker and
Bellis, 1995; Gangestad and Thornhill, 1998; Penton-Voak and Perrett, 2000; Regan 1996).
Based on this account, if the male shame expression is a reliable signal of good genetic
quality (by virtue of communicating the displayer's respect for social norms and potential
trustworthiness), then women at the highest-risk for conception stage of the cycle should
find shame-displaying men more attractive than women at a low-conception-risk stage.
However, past work has shown that women at peak fertility are highly attracted to
dominant men (Little, Jones, and Burriss, 2007), suggesting that at least one of the
messages communicated by shame (submissiveness) is likely to be indicative of poor
genetic fitness. Based on this finding, women at high conception risk might be expected to
be less attracted to shame displayers. However, because this prior study did not examine
the impact of conception risk on perceived attractiveness of shame or other submissive
displays, but only on dominant-appearing men, it remains unclear whether the complexity
of positive and negative messages communicated by shame result in a net gain or loss in
terms of mate value.
In Study 1 we addressed this question by testing whether women who are at high
risk for conception, based on their current stage of the menstrual cycle, are more attracted
to men displaying shame compared to women at a lower risk for conception. We also tested
whether women's risk of conception (based on cycle) influences their attraction to men
The puzzling attractiveness of male shame
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(1). 2015. -33-
displaying other emotion expressions (i.e., pride, happiness, and neutrality), to determine
whether any shift in preference for shame-displaying men could be attributed to a more
general tendency for women at high-conception risk to judge male targets as more
attractive compared to women at low risk.
In our second study, we adopted an approach from the cross-cultural psychological
literature, in which individuals from maximally divergent cultures are compared, to
examine the extent to which certain psychological phenomena might be considered human
universals (see Norenzayan and Heine, 2005). Inherent in this approach is the assumption
that if a particular psychological preference is found across groups expected to show
cultural differences in the relevant trait, then this preference is likely to be a human
universal, and thus may reflect evolutionary processes. Applying this perspective to the
current research question, if male shame displays are judged as attractive by women living
in a cultural setting with markedly different customs and values from North America, and,
in particular, different cultural attitudes about shame and its associated message of low
status, this would suggest that these displays may be universally attractive, and thus
provide support for the invariant genetic fitness explanation. Conversely, if we find cultural
variation in the attractiveness of male shame, such that women from cultures holding
different attitudes about the importance of men attaining and demonstrating high status do
not find male shame displays attractive, it would support the hypothesis that the
expression's attractiveness in North American samples is dependent on culturally specific
values about mate-relevant characteristics within that local ecology.
Thus, in Study 2, we compared the attractiveness judgments of male shame displays
made by North American women with those made by women from India. We targeted
Indian women as a comparison population for several reasons. First, India is one of the
very few non-Western countries where researchers have examined recognition of the shame
display, and produced findings suggesting that shame is recognized equally well by Indians
and North Americans (Haidt and Keltner, 1999). This finding ensures that any cultural
differences observed in the attractiveness of male shame displays, between the U.S. and
India, cannot be attributed to cultural differences in how the display is recognized.
Second, there are major cultural differences between India and North America in
attitudes toward shame. In North American cultures, shame is considered a "hidden"
emotion, typically not discussed or even acknowledged by those experiencing it (Lewis,
1971; Scheff, Retzinger, and Ryan, 1989). In fact, shame has been rated by North
Americans as the most painful emotion to experience (Lazarus, 1991, p. 557). Not
surprisingly then, the shame expression tends to be suppressed by individuals from these
cultures, even in situations of major public failure (Tracy and Matsumoto, 2008). In
contrast, in India, as in many Asian cultures, shame is a highly valued emotion, considered
essential to social harmony and "making the world move along" (see Rozin, 2003, p. 278).
Individuals from these cultures tend to reliably display the shame expression in response to
public failure (Tracy and Matsumoto, 2008). For these reasons, we might expect Indian
women to find shame-displaying men even more attractive than American women.
However, the third reason for our choice of India as a comparison culture would suggest
the opposite hypothesis.
Shame and pride are two emotions that, more than any others, communicate
information about status (Shariff and Tracy, 2009; Steckler and Tracy, 2014). These
expressions send strong messages of low and high status, respectively, and they do so when
The puzzling attractiveness of male shame
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(1). 2015. -34-
perceived at both an implicit and explicit level, and across highly divergent cultural
contexts (Shariff and Tracy, 2009; Shariff et al., 2012; Tracy et al., 2013). As a result, the
attractiveness of men displaying these status-connoting expressions may be particularly
affected by cultural variations in attitudes about status, and the importance placed upon the
status of a potential mate. Prior research suggests that women's preference for high- versus
low-status partners depends on features of their local ecology; American women tend to
prioritize a potential male partner's status less than do women from other cultures (Li et al.,
2011). More broadly, re-analyses of results from a survey examining over 9,000 individuals
in 37 cultures worldwide (Buss et al., 1990) showed that women's tendency to seek high-
status male partners varies greatly by culture (Kasser and Sharma, 1999). Women from
cultures with reduced reproductive freedom (i.e., little access to birth control or abortion)
and fewer educational or economic opportunities for women were found to place a greater
emphasis on status as an indicator of a male partner's attractiveness, compared to women
from cultures with greater access to these liberties. When women can independently
acquire the resources needed to support themselves and their offspring, it becomes less
important that they find a high-status mate who will do so for them.
From this perspective, we might attribute the findings of male shame's
attractiveness among North American women to the fact that these women are not
necessarily seeking high-status partners, allowing them to downplay the low-status
message conveyed by shame, and focus on the expression's more positive associations.
Conversely, women in India tend to have considerably fewer educational opportunities, and
a lesser representation in the labor force, compared to women in the U.S. (United Nations
Development Programme [UNDP], 2011), making Indian women particularly likely to
value and emphasize high status in potential mates. Based on this account, we would
predict that Indian women would find male shame displays particularly unattractive. Study
2 tested these competing hypotheses.
In both studies, we also assessed individual differences in mating strategies using
the Socio-Sexual Orientation Scale-Revised (SOI-R; Penke and Asendorpf, 2008) in order
to control for individual differences in participants' orientation toward a short-term versus
long-term mating strategy. Previous research suggests that these strategies influence
preferences in the mating domain (including preferences for status-relevant traits; e.g.,
Waynforth, Delwadia, and Camm, 2005) and can vary across culture and ovulatory stage
(Schaller and Murray, 2008; see Haselton and Gangestad, 2006). Thus, to ensure that any
effects found cannot be attributed to differences in mating strategy, SOI-R scores were
treated as a covariate in all between-subjects analyses.1

Kwang, and Gosling, 2011) to participate online in exchange for monetary compensation.
Thirty-three women who were not heterosexual were excluded, given our research goals of
examining heterosexual attraction,2 and one participant was excluded for giving an
attractiveness rating of "1" to 38 of the 40 target photographs.
Of the remaining 138 women, we excluded 30 women who indicated that they
either experienced irregular menstrual cycles,3 were pregnant, or were using any form of
hormonal contraception (see Haselton and Gildersleeve, 2011).
Women were shown a calendar of the current and previous 2 months and asked to
use it in facilitating their response to the question: "How many days has it been since the
onset of your last period of menses?" To address concerns raised in previous research
regarding the validity of assessing menstrual history via self-report (Bean et al., 1979; but
see Baker, Denning, Kostin, and Schwartz, 1998), after reporting the date of their most
recent menses onset, participants were asked, "Within how many days are you 100%
confident in your above estimate?"; they responded using a scale ranging from 1 to 7,
where 1 indicated "0 days (I'm 100% confident in my answer)," 2 indicated "1 day," 3
indicated "2 days," 4 indicated "3 days," 5 indicated "4 days," 6 indicated "5 days," and 7
indicated "More than 5 days (I'm not very confident in my above answer)." Using these
confidence estimates, participants were assigned to one of two conception-risk categories,
following the 28-day model of the menstrual cycle (Gangestad, and Thornhill, 1998): "high
conception risk" (days 6­14; n = 29), or "low conception risk" (days 0­5 and 15­28; n =
45).4
All additional participants for whom category membership could not be determined
(high vs. low conception risk) with 100% certainty (n = 34) were excluded. Specifically,
we excluded, for example, any participant who indicated that her last menses began 12 days
ago but that she was 100% confident of that estimate within 3 days. In such a case, it was
assumed that her last period began 9­15 days ago, and thus that she could not be safely
included in either the high-risk (days 6­14) or low-risk (days 0­5 and 15­28) category. In
contrast, any participant who indicated that her last menses began 10 days ago and was
100% confident within 3 days would be included, because it could be assumed that her
2 Sexual orientation is not binary; we thus measured this variable using a continuous rating scale (a 1-7 scale
where 1 = "exclusively heterosexual," 4 = "bisexual," and 7 = "exclusively homosexual"), allowing
participants to indicate the degree to which they are attracted to members of the opposite sex. Women were
excluded from analyses if they rated themselves as a 4 or above on this rating scale; as a result, there were a
relatively high number of non-exclusively heterosexual women included.
3 Though women with irregular cycles are, at times, "at risk for conception," it is impossible to accurately
estimate the window of high and low conception risk for these women, because our estimations are based on
the variation that occurs within a regular 28-day cycle. For this reason, it was necessary to exclude these
women from Study 1, in which the critical tests depended on estimating women's conception risk as
accurately as possible.
4 Several previous studies examining the effects of menstrual cycle stage have excluded women who are
currently menstruating or premenstrual (days 0­4 and 24­28 since onset) to rule out the possibility that
psychological effects observed (e.g., mood effects) might be due to hormonal changes associated with the
menstrual phase or premenstrual symptoms (see Haselton and Gildersleeve, 2011). Here, we saw no reason to
exclude these women (n = 20); however, all reported effects hold if these women are excluded from analyses,
except where noted.

period began 7­13 days ago, placing her firmly within the high-risk category (days 6­14).
This method of confidence estimation has been used effectively in previous research (Beall
and Tracy, 2013; Tracy and Beall, 2014).5
Materials
Research methods were approved by the University of British Columbia Behavioral
Research Ethics Board, and informed consent was obtained. Participants viewed photos,
online, of 40 men displaying each of four expressions: shame, happiness, pride, and neutral
(10 photos of each expression). Photos were taken from previous emotion research (Sample
B, Tracy and Beall, 2011) and portrayed 40 different individuals either in full, from the
waist up, or face only. These were collected from online sources (e.g., google.com) by
research assistants blind to the hypotheses, who were trained to identify each expression.
Emotion-FACS (Ekman and Rosenberg, 2005), as well as criteria developed by Tracy and
Robins (2007), were used to ensure that each photograph accurately conveyed its intended
emotion and not any other emotion. Targets portrayed in photos varied in age
(approximately 18­49 years) and ethnicity (65% were Caucasian, 8% African American,
10% Asian, and 17% other). Photos were presented in a randomized order. For each photo,
participants responded to the question, "How sexually attractive do you find this person?"
using a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (Very Unattractive) to 9 (Very Attractive).
Attractiveness ratings were completed after women responded to questions assessing their
current risk for conception.
Results
Mean attractiveness scores for each emotion expression were computed across
attractiveness ratings of all exemplars of each expression (interrater s ranged from .78­
.84). Replicating previous findings (Tracy and Beall, 2011), an examination of results
across ovulatory stage demonstrated that women found shame-displaying men to be
significantly more attractive than happy-displaying men, t(71) = 5.23, d = 0.59, and
neutral-displaying men, t(71) = 10.48, d = 1.03; both ps < .001. Also replicating previous
findings, there was no significant difference in attractive judgments between shame-and
pride displaying men, t(72) = -1.21, d = 0.12, p = .23. Pride was judged as significantly
more attractive than happiness, t(71) = 6.64, d = 0.71, and neutrality, t(71) = 10.77, d =
1.14, both ps < .001. Male happiness displays were judged as more attractive only than
neutral displays, t(71) = 3.84, d = 0.41, p < .001.
To examine whether the effects of emotion expressions on attractiveness varied
across ovulatory stage, we conducted a 4 (emotion) x 2 (conception risk) mixed measures
ANCOVA (controlling for SOI-R). There was no main effect of conception risk on
attractiveness judgments overall, F(1, 64) = 1.96, p = .17, d = 0.35, suggesting that women
at high conception risk did not show a general tendency to find men more attractive
regardless of their emotional display. However, there was a significant emotion x
5 In all cases except where noted, reported effects held when women's self-reported confidence estimates
were not taken into account in determining category membership (i.e., when women were assigned to a high
or low risk category on the basis of their reported first day of last menses alone).

conception risk interaction, F(3, 62) = 3.23, p = .028, d = 0.79,6 indicating that the effect of
conception risk on attractiveness varied by emotion expression. To understand this
interaction, we separately examined the effect of conception risk on attractiveness
judgments of each expression.
Specifically, we conducted four ANCOVAs (controlling for SOI-R), with level of
conception risk as the fixed factor, predicting attractiveness judgments for each expression.
This revealed a significant effect of conception risk for shame-displays; men expressing
shame were judged as less attractive by women who were at a high risk for conception than
those at low risk, F(1,64) = 6.81, p = .011, d = 0.65.7 In contrast, for pride, happiness, and
neutral displays, no significant effects of conception risk emerged, F(1, 64) = 1.17, p = .28,
d = 0.27; F(1, 64) = 0.27, p = .61, d = 0.13; and F(1,64) = 0.30, p = .58, d = 0.14,
respectively (see Figure 1).

Note. n = 74. Error bars represent standard errors of the mean.
6 This interaction was reduced to marginal significance when we based estimates of conception-risk category
membership on reported dates without regard to women's estimates of how confident they were in those
dates, F(3, 79) = 2.34, p = .08, d = 0.60. The interaction was also reduced to non-significance when women
who were menstruating or premenstrual were excluded from the analysis, F(3, 44) = 2.07, p = .12, d = 0.75.
Notably, in both cases effect sizes were not substantially reduced.
7 We also tested whether the effect of conception risk on attractiveness ratings of male shame was moderated
by SOI. No interaction emerged, b = -.195, SEb = .150,  = -.159, p = .20.

This pattern of results suggests that women at high risk for conception found
shame-displaying men particularly unattractive. This finding is consistent with the
hypothesis that shame displays signal poor-quality genes, such that women who are most
likely to conceive benefit from not mating with these men. Given that the observed effect
was a reduced level of attraction reported by high-risk women, it cannot be attributed to a
general tendency for high-risk women to find men more attractive. Furthermore, this effect
seems to be specific to the shame expression.
These results lend no support to our account of male shame as attractive because the
display indicates good genetic fitness. Instead, they suggest that displaying shame may be
an indicator of poor genetic fitness among men. Thus, the current and previous finding that
North American women find shame-displaying men particularly attractive may be best
explained as a byproduct of specific cultural values present in a North American ecology.
To support that conclusion, however, we need to examine judgments of shame-
displaying men made by women from other cultural contexts. As mentioned previously,
American women tend to prioritize a potential male partner's status less than do women
from cultures where women have reduced reproductive freedom (i.e., little access to birth
control or abortion) and fewer educational or economic opportunities (Li et al., 2011;
Kasser and Sharma, 1999). As a result, North American women may be attracted to men
expressing shame because their cultural values allow them to disregard shame's low-status
signal (which conveys poor fitness) and instead focus on shame's more pro-social messages
of appeasement and trustworthiness. In contrast, women from countries where women have
fewer educational opportunities and a lesser representation in the labor force than in the
U.S., such as India (UNDP, 2011), might show a relatively weaker attraction to shame-
displaying men. If so, this would support the conclusion of Study 1 that the previously
documented finding of the attractiveness of male shame displays is attributable to cultural
factors specific to North American women.
To test this possibility, in Study 2 we examined whether the attractiveness of male
shame displays varies by culture; that is, whether North American women's attraction to
male shame differs from that of Indian women.
Study 2
Materials and Methods
Participants, materials, and procedure
Research methods were approved by the University of British Columbia Behavioral
Research Ethics Board, and informed consent was obtained. Participants (total N = 229)
were: (a) the 138 American heterosexual women who were recruited for Study 1 (aged 18­
42; 73% Caucasian, 10% Asian, 17% Other), including those who had been excluded from
Study 1 due to ovulatory stage, irregular menstrual cycles, hormonal birth control use, or
pregnancy; and (b) a new sample of 91 Indian women (aged 18­39; 100% Indian) who
volunteered to participate in exchange for monetary compensation on Amazon Mechanical
TurkTM. All additional participants (i.e., not included in Study 1) reported being
heterosexual.
All participants viewed the same photos, online, as were used in Study 1: 40 men
displaying each of four expressions: shame, happiness, pride, and a neutral control (10

males showing each expression). Photos were again presented in a randomized order, and
for each photo, participants responded to the question, "How sexually attractive do you find
this person?" using a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (Very Unattractive) to 9 (Very
Attractive).8 Women who participated in Study 1 did not make these judgments twice;
rather, Study 2 draws on these same data, such that 63 participants and their responses
overlapped between the two studies.
Results
As in Study 1, mean attractiveness scores for each emotion expression were
computed across ratings of all exemplars of each expression (interrater s ranged from .81­
.88). To examine whether the effect of emotion expression on attractiveness varied across
cultural background, we conducted a 4 (emotion) x 2 (cultural identity) mixed measures
ANCOVA (controlling for SOI-R) predicting mean attractiveness ratings. No main effect
of culture emerged, F(1, 211) = 0.73, p = .39, d = 0.11, suggesting that Indian and
American women do not differ in the extent to which they judge men sexually attractive
across the emotion expression displayed.
However, a significant interaction emerged between emotion expression and
culture, F(3, 209) = 10.22, p < .001, d = 0.77, suggesting that the effect of emotion
expressions on attractiveness varied by culture. To better understand this difference, we
examined results separately for the U.S. and Indian samples. In the U.S. sample, the same
pattern observed in Study 1 emerged: Shame displays were judged to be more attractive
than happy displays, t(135) = 6.59, d = 0.48, and neutral displays, t(135) = 11.90, d = 0.85,
both ps < .001. In addition, shame-displaying men again did not differ significantly in
attractiveness from pride-displaying men, t(136) = -1.53, d = 0.10, p = .13. Pride-displaying
men were judged as significantly more attractive than happy-displaying men, t(135) = 7.42,
d = 0.57, and neutral-displaying men, t(135) = 12.18, d = 0.90, both ps <.001. Finally,
happy displays were judged as significantly more attractive than neutral, t(136) = 4.62, d =
0.34, p < .001.
However, in the Indian sample, a notably different pattern emerged. Here, shame-
displayers were judged to be significantly less attractive than pride-displayers, t(90) = -
7.06, d = 0.67, p < .001, and no more attractive than happy-displayers, t(90) = -1.38, d =
0.15, p = .17. Shame-displayers were more attractive than neutral-displayers, t(90) = 4.44,
d = 0.40, p < .001. Pride-displayers were more attractive than happy displayers, t(90) =
8.86, d = 0.57, and neutral-displayers, t(90) = 13.74, d = 1.09; both ps < .001, and
happiness displayers were significantly more attractive than neutral displayers among
Indians as well, t(90) = 7.09, d = 0.47, p < .001.
To more directly test the hypothesis that the attractiveness of male shame displays
varies across cultures, we next performed four ANCOVAs with cultural background as the
fixed factor, controlling for SOI-R, predicting the attractiveness of each expression
separately (see Figure 2). Results revealed a significant effect of culture for shame; Indian
women judged men displaying shame to be significantly less attractive than did American
8 One additional participant was excluded for giving a rating of "1" to 39 of the 40 target photographs.

women, F(1,211) = 4.57, d = 0.29, p = .03.9 Interestingly, a significant culture effect also
emerged for pride, but in the opposite direction; Indian women judged men displaying
pride to be significantly more attractive than did American women, F(1,211) = 6.44, d =
0.35, p = .01. No cultural differences emerged for happiness F(1,211) = 2.32, d = 0.21, p =
.13, or neutrality F(1,211) = 0.61, d = 0.11, p = .44.

Note. n = 229. Error bars represent standard errors of the mean.
Thus, Indian women found shame-displaying men relatively unattractive compared
to American women, despite the fact that Indian culture places a high value on shame and
shame displays. More broadly, this result suggests that the shame display's attractiveness
varies by culture, possibly due to differences in the mate-relevant trait characteristics
prioritized within each local ecology. Interestingly, the reverse pattern emerged for male
pride displays; Indian women found male pride-displayers more attractive than did
American women. Given that there was no overall cultural difference in attractiveness
9 As in Study 1, we also tested whether SOI moderated the effect of conception risk on women's attraction to
male shame. We found a significant interaction, F(3, 210) = 6.30, p < .001, indicating that Indian women who
were higher in SOI felt a stronger attraction to shame-displaying men, b = -.184, SEb = .093,  = -.133, p <
.05. However, this same interaction emerged for judgments of neutral expressions, b = -.198, SEb = .083,  =
-.163, p < .05, suggesting that this effect was not due to any impact of shame, in particular, but rather to a
general tendency for high SOI Indian women to be particularly attracted to men, regardless of the emotion
they are expressing (in fact, a marginal interaction emerged for judgments of pride displays, as well).
The puzzling attractiveness of male shame

ratings across all targets, these results cannot be attributed to broader cultural differences in
women's ratings of male attractiveness. Rather, this difference seems to be specific to the
shame and pride displays--the two displays that most strongly convey status information.
These results are thus consistent with the hypothesis that shame displays' attractiveness in
American cultural contexts is partly due to the fact that American women do not place a
high value on the status of a potential mate compared to women from cultures where there
is less female economic freedom, such as India.
Discussion
The present research tested competing explanations for the previous finding that
North American women are particularly attracted to men displaying shame. Specifically,
we examined whether the attractiveness of male shame displays is best explained by the
hypothesis that shame displays indicate good genetic fitness, or the hypothesis that North
American women, in particular, are attracted to male displays of shame as a result of
particular features of their local ecology. Results across two studies provide consistent
support for the latter hypothesis.
More specifically, Study 1 demonstrated that women at highest risk for
conception--who tend to be particularly attuned to signals of genetic fitness--are less
attracted to men displaying shame compared to women at low conception risk. This
suggests that the expression's appeal is not likely to be biologically driven and, in fact, that
shame-displaying men have low mate value, from a genetic standpoint. Past research
suggests that women at peak fertility are especially attracted to men who exhibit dominant
characteristics (Little et al., 2007), and given that shame is a low-dominance display, this
could be a potential explanation for the findings of Study 1.
Study 2 demonstrated a cultural difference in the attractiveness of male shame
displays, with American women showing greater attraction to these displays than Indian
women. This cultural difference may be due to several factors. Specifically, these two
cultures likely differ in the importance placed on a man's ability to attain high status. Prior
research suggests that women in cultures that allow them the opportunity to acquire the
resources needed to support themselves and their offspring can be more tolerant of
potential mates who are low in status (Kasser and Sharma, 1999). Thus, North American
women may be able to find men who display shame attractive, despite the expression's
communication of low-status, because they set aside this implication of the expression and
focus on its other, more attractive qualities (e.g., trustworthiness, respect for social norms).
Future studies are needed to test whether the perception of these qualities in fact account
for the attractiveness of male shame displays among North American women.
Implications
The present findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolution of human
emotion expressions and their impact on mate selection. Many emotion expressions
communicate fitness-relevant information to observers, and this may have been an
important factor in their early evolution and persistence. The present findings, however,
suggest that the male shame display may indicate poor genetic fitness, and thus that the
expression of shame, at least when shown by men, has evolved and persisted for reasons
other than communicating one's mate value. Given prior research suggesting that shame
functions as an appeasement signal, the shame expression is more likely to have evolved to
The puzzling attractiveness of male shame

serve this function; displaying shame in response to social transgression or failure may help
minimize harm and antagonism from others by communicating the displayer's respect for
social norms and/or others' greater relative power or dominance (Keltner et al., 1997;
Martens et al., 2012). In situations where such displays are necessary, shame expressions
have likely provided a net fitness gain, despite the reproductive fitness loss that may be
incurred.
These findings also have implications for our understanding of the role of status
signaling in romantic attraction. Our explanation for American women's propensity to find
shame-displaying men attractive is that these women do not need to mate with high-status
men in order to ensure their own and their offspring's survival, given that American
women typically have equal access to economic and education opportunities (see Kasser
and Sharma, 1999). The finding that Indian women are less attracted to men showing
shame (and more attracted to men showing pride) provides some support for this
explanation, given that India has considerably lower gender equality than the US (UNDP,
2011), though more work is needed to directly test this account.
Limitations and future directions
One potential limitation of the current research is that the baseline attractiveness of
men in our photo set may have differed by emotion expression condition purely as a result
of chance (e.g., men showing shame may have been more attractive than those showing
pride regardless of the expression they displayed). However, as noted above, the photo
collection procedure used involved the collection of photos by research assistants who were
blind to hypotheses (see Tracy and Beall, 2011). Therefore, there is no reason to suspect
that the photos chosen of individuals displaying shame would be any more or less attractive
than the photos of individuals displaying other emotions for any systematic reason,
especially given the large number of photos collected. More broadly, by demonstrating
differences in the attractiveness of shame displays (by conception risk and cultural group),
but not for overall attractiveness ratings irrespective of emotion (there was no overall effect
of conception risk or cultural group on attractiveness ratings), our results suggest that the
present findings would not emerge irrespective of emotion expression. In other words, if
men displaying shame in the photos we used happened to be more attractive than men
displaying other expressions for reasons other than their emotion expression, it is difficult
to explain why we would have observed the specific effects we did--that women at high
conception risk found these shame-displaying men less attractive, and that women from
India found these shame-displaying men less attractive.
Another methodological limitation, relevant to Study 1, was our assessment of
women's ovulatory cycle using a self-report rather than a hormonal method. Although the
reliability of the self-report assessment of ovulation has been disputed (Bean et al., 1979;
but see Baker et al., 1998), our invocation of a relatively new method to assess women's
confidence in their self-reported menses onset helps ameliorate these concerns.
Specifically, we asked women to report how confident they were in their estimate of the
date of the first day of their last period of menses, and women who could not be included in
one category or the other with 100% confidence were excluded from analyses. Although it
is likely that women do make errors in their self-reported menses dates, they are also likely
to have a good sense of their own level of accuracy on this topic, and our method takes
advantage of that self-insight in a way that few prior studies have (see also Beall and Tracy,
2013; Tracy and Beall, 2014). As a result, although the self-report method used here is still
The puzzling attractiveness of male shame
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(1). 2015. -43-
vulnerable to concerns regarding individual differences in when ovulation occurs in the
cycle, it is substantially less vulnerable to concerns about the potential for inaccurately
estimating the date of ovulation, as a result of women's failure to accurately report their
prior date of menses.
A limitation of Study 2 is that India and the U.S. differ in many cultural and
demographic features beyond the critical difference presumed to account for the present
results--female economic freedom. Additional research is thus needed to more directly
target the mechanism that accounts for these effects. For example, future studies might
compare groups that vary in economic freedom within the same population. If American
women of higher socio-economic status are found to be more attracted to male shame
displays compared to American women of lower socio-economic status, this would provide
support for the proposed mechanism underlying the cultural difference observed in Study 2.
In addition, future research is needed to directly address other possible explanations
for the now well-replicated finding that American women do not find shame expressions
particularly unattractive.10 In addition to trustworthiness and sensitivity to social norms,
shame may also communicate rebelliousness, given that it occurs in response to social
transgression. Rebelliousness connotes risk-taking--behaviors men are known to engage in
when they are motivated toward romantic goals, presumably because they believe it will
increase their attractiveness (Baker and Maner, 2008). It is thus possible that in ecologies
where male assertiveness and/or independence are more highly valued, such as American
culture, shame's appealing "rebel" message may override some of the less alluring
messages sent by the display. Future work is needed to test this account, and to examine
which of shame's various other social cues (e.g., trustworthiness, social sensitivity,
rebelliousness) may best explain the extant results. Additional research on this topic would
benefit from directly asking women, within various cultural groups, to report the reasons
for their attraction to men showing shame. Although mate preferences are largely guided by
signals of reproductive fitness that tend to be perceived without conscious awareness (Buss,
1994; Geary Vigil, and Byrd-Craven, 2004), simply asking women to explain their
attraction to men displaying shame may be useful for generating additional, culturally
specific hypotheses regarding the expression's attractiveness.
Regardless of these important future directions, the present findings provide new
insights on the robust attractiveness of male shame found among North American women
(Tracy and Beall, 2011).

10 Combining all data we have collected thus far testing North American women's attractiveness to male
shame displays, from four separate American samples (American participants in the present research, as well
as Samples A, B, and C, from Study 2 of Tracy and Beall, 2011), we found that male shame-displayers were
judged to be significantly less attractive than male pride-displayers, t(639) = -7.35, p < .001, d = -0.21, 95%
CI [-0.28, -0.14], but significantly (and substantially) more attractive than happy-displayers, t(638) = 18.29, p
< .001, d = 0.59, 95% CI [0.53, 0.66] and neutral displayers, t(638) = 26.76, p < .001, d = 0.82, 95% CI [0.75,
0.88].
