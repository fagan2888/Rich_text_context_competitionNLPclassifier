Introduction
English education programs in rural areas of Sri Lanka have
been found to be minimally successful, compared to the large
investments made on them over the last few decades
(Karunaratne, 2003). Some studies that investigated the stu-
dents' English proficiency in rural schools report that those
students show relatively low or limited proficiency in English
in general and in oral proficiency in particular (Karunaratne,
2003; Perera, 2001). Given the importance of teaching oral
English to students in rural schools, the present study aims to
investigate why a majority of students fail to achieve oral
proficiency in the target language and how this problem is
addressed in the domain of teaching English as a second lan-
guage (ESL) in Sri Lankan context.
Research Problem
In most of the Sinhala-medium government schools (72%;
Ministry of Education Sri Lanka, 2008) in Sri Lanka, English
is taught as compulsory foreign language commencing from
Grades 1 to 12. For classroom instruction, teachers use gov-
ernment textbooks, which are freely distributed to students.
For English language education, the Educational Publications
Department provides teaching and learning materials for all
school grades. The materials consist of a pupil's book, work-
book, and a teacher's instructional manual. Sri Lankan stu-
dents generally study English during their school period and
also receive opportunities to study various English courses at
university or other higher education institutions, provided
they gain entry into one of them through competitive exams.
Despite all the opportunities and facilities which Sri Lankan
students have for learning English, a majority of them, espe-
cially rural students, do not gain mastery in oral proficiency
(Karunaratne, 2003). Moreover, the World Bank (2005)
report mentions that the school completers and graduates
have low generic skills in English language fluency and
information technology (IT), which are demanded by the
labor market, and as a result, they have to remain unem-
ployed even though they are educated.
The researcher's observations and the analysis of the data
gathered from classroom teacher­learner interaction and
reviewing the literature related to the current study have

Oral Competency of ESL/EFL Learners in
Sri Lankan Rural School Context
Sarath Withanarachchi Samaranayake1
Abstract
This study investigates the current teaching trends and practices in teaching oral English in rural Sinhala-medium schools in Sri
Lanka and their relevance to the current theoretical, empirical, and pedagogical perspectives of second-language acquisition
(SLA). The present study, which was conducted in two Sri Lankan Sinhala-medium rural schools, is a case study in which
the classroom observation, interviewing of the participants, and videotaping of students' interaction were included as data
collection tools. The spoken data were analyzed using the Communicative Orientation of Language Teaching (COLT) scheme
designed by Fröhlich, Spada, and Allen, while the numerical data obtained from the structured speaking test (Cambridge
Key English for Schools Test) were analyzed using independent samples t test. The findings of the study indicate that the
instructional method used by English teachers does not provide the learners with adequate input of the target language to
improve their oral communication skills in rural school contexts. As a result, a majority of students from rural schools in Sri
Lanka demonstrate a limited or a low proficiency level in oral communication in English. Therefore, possible reasons for the
lack of greater awareness towards more communicative teaching are discussed, and suggestions for promoting changes in
teaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in rural school contexts are offered.

revealed that the teaching practices in the context of Sri
Lankan rural schools do not necessarily cater for the learn-
ers' communicative needs. Therefore, students who study
English in such a background as described above find it dif-
ficult to engage fluently and accurately in conversations in
real-world situations. As a majority of students from rural
areas fail to achieve oral proficiency in the target language in
school context, the present study was undertaken to investi-
gate the factors that negatively affect learners achieving oral
proficiency in English. Based on the findings, the present
study suggests possible ways and means to improve teaching
materials and the instructional practices that can help low
achievers develop their oral communication skills. To engage
with the research problem as stated above, two research
questions were formulated as below.
Research Questions
Research Question 1: Why do a majority of students in
rural schools show a low or limited oral proficiency in the
target language?
Research Question 2: Do teachers of English in rural
schools use the communicative language teaching (CLT)
approach in their classroom teaching?
To answer the research questions as stated above, two
hypotheses were postulated.
Research Hypothesis
Hypothesis 1: A majority of students studying in rural
schools have a low or limited oral proficiency in the target
language.
Hypothesis 2: A majority of English teachers teaching in
rural schools use the CLT approach in their classroom
teaching.
Objectives of the Study
By conducting this study, the researcher hoped to achieve the
following objectives:
1. To find out why a majority of students in rural schools
fail to achieve oral proficiency in the target language
and suggest practicable measures.
2. To examine the extent to which the instructional
practices help learners develop their oral proficiency
in the target language in such contexts as stated
above.
3. To inform the English teachers, English language
training (ELT) material producers, authorities, and
policy makers who are responsible for English edu-
cation in Sri Lanka the extent to which the current
ELT teaching and learning materials used in govern-
ment schools are deviant from the pedagogical views
of second-language acquisition (SLA) and how this
gap is bridged.
Literature Review
This section focuses on theoretical base of communication
skills and a brief description of CLT, and then provides a
general overview of empirical and pedagogical aspects of
teaching oral English to ESL/English as a Foreign Language
(EFL) learners. Moreover, the studies that have investigated
the instructional practices used in L2 classroom teaching in
Sri Lankan context are explored with reference to published
literature and their relevance to the current study.
Theories of Basic Communication Skills
According to Canale and Swain (1980), a theory of basic
communication skills can be ascribed to one that empha-
sizes the minimum level of (mainly oral) communication
skills that a learner is required to cope with the most com-
mon second/foreign language situations the learner is
likely to encounter. They, furthermore, suggest that more
effective second-language training can take place if
emphasis is placed on the meaning of the message rather
than on the grammatical appropriateness of one's utter-
ances. As a result of research on applied linguistics, psy-
chology, and sociolinguistics, a lot of changes have taken
place in the field of second-language learning and teach-
ing. As Brown (2000) puts it, "Foreign language learning
started to be viewed not just as potentially predictable
developmental process but also as the creation of meaning
through interactive negotiation among the learners"
(p. 245). Thus, the concept of communicative competence
(Hymes, 1972) became established, and the CLT approach
replaced the traditional teaching methods used in most L2
teaching contexts.
In general, CLT involves developing language profi-
ciency through interactions embedded in meaningful con-
texts. This approach to teaching provides authentic
opportunities for learning that go beyond repetition and
memorization of grammatical patterns in isolation.
According to adherents of CLT, the central concept of the
communicative approach to language teaching is to develop
communicative competence in the learners, so that they
will be able to understand and use language appropriately
to communicate in real-world and academic environments.
Even though CLT is not the only language teaching
approach that can account for success in L2 acquisition,
most of the language teaching techniques (information gap
activities, language games, role-plays, and simulations) and
the type of materials (mostly authentic) used in CLT class-
rooms, where ESL/EFL learners had limited chances to use
the target language, have been found helpful in that learners
have been able to develop proficiency in the target language
(Liao, 2000; Rao, 2002; Shin, 1999).

Teaching Oral English
As discussed above, the main objective of teaching oral com-
munication skills to learners is to make them competent
users of a target language. It is evident that most rural stu-
dents in Sri Lanka can read and write in English, but they do
not know how to speak (Karunaratne, 2003; Perera, 2001).
They need to learn how to communicate in real-world situa-
tions such as workplace, school, and other life-related events.
Given the present status of oral communication skills of the
linguistically disadvantaged rural students of Sri Lanka, it
seems necessary for English teachers to figure out ways and
means through which they can help their learners to improve
oral proficiency in the target language. To this end, teachers
can easily use several classroom techniques as suggested in
CLT (role-plays, language games, information gap activities,
and authentic materials) where learners will find the samples
of real language spoken by real people outside the class. The
idea of exposure to authentic materials is important in Sri
Lankan rural context as most students have limited opportu-
nities for practicing the target language outside the class-
room. Several authors (Crookall & Oxford, 1990;
Larsen-Freeman, 2000; Ments, 1989) have observed that
role-playing activities can provide learners with opportuni-
ties for them to engage in modified interaction with their
peers and the teacher. Moreover, Crookall and Oxford (1990)
and Littlewood (1992) have asserted that role-plays not only
help learners develop their oral proficiency in the target lan-
guage but they also provide opportunities for students to
appropriate the kinds of linguistic behavior patterns which
they will need to produce outside the classroom.
Empirical Evidence of L2 Instructional Practice in
Sri Lanka
The studies cited below are similar to the current study in
some aspects. In a school-based study conducted by
Karunaratne (2003), it has been reported that the teaching
styles adapted by teachers were not in line with the CLT
approach and that the teachers heavily depended on the
English textbook. Therefore, in classroom teaching, no
authentic, teacher-prepared material or communicative
activities were used. The researcher concluded that the
teacher­student interaction was completely in their native
language. Therefore, learners received no opportunity to
improve their communication skills in the target language.
A similar study, which was conducted by Perera (2001) to
find out the role of classroom interaction in L2 acquisition
in Sri Lankan secondary school context, has found similar
results to those of Karunaratne's study. However, Perera
(2001) used the Communicative Orientation of Language
Teaching (COLT) scheme same as the researcher of the
current study did in classroom observation and found that
some teachers were not proficient enough to deliver lesson
effectively in that they resorted to use the native language
to explain the lesson. One of the weaknesses in both stud-
ies cited above is that both studies were conducted in urban
contexts where more facilities and opportunities to learn
English are readily available than in rural and semi-urban
contexts. However, the present study was conducted in
rural school contexts.
Method
In this study, a mixed-methods research framework was
used to investigate the type of teaching practices used by
English teachers in rural school context. The design of the
research entailed a case study in which classroom observa-
tion, interviewing of the participants (students), and video-
taping of students' interaction were included as research
instruments to gather data. The data gathered from the
three research instruments were analyzed qualitatively and
quantitatively to answer the research questions posed in
the study. The study was conducted in two Sinhala-medium
state rural schools in Sri Lanka in two consecutive days in
December 2015. The two schools were selected based on
the common assumption that students in rural schools fail
to achieve oral proficiency in the target language even
though they can achieve proficiency in reading and
writing.
Participants of the Study
The participants in this study were school children studying
in Grade 10 from two Sri Lankan state schools; as noted
above, both schools were from a rural area. The two schools
are named A and B hereafter for identification purpose. The
Grade 10 students from School A consisted of 11 boys and
14 girls making a total of 25 students aged 15, while the
Grade 10 students from School B consisted of 14 boys and
15 girls making a total of 29 students aged 15. All students
from both schools belong to Sinhala ethnic group. Moreover,
the structured interview conducted with the students
revealed that most of the students in both schools come
from low-income-generating families. These students have
less or no opportunities to hear or use English except in the
classroom.
Data Collection Tools
In this study, to gather data, three research tools were used as
follows:
Classroom observation: As noted above, classroom obser-
vations were conducted in two schools (Grade 10) in two
different days, and each observation lasted 40 to 45 min.
Videotaping of the students' interactions: Two teaching
sessions were video recorded from the beginning to the
end, and later the classroom data were transcribed and
analyzed using the COLT scheme designed by Fröhlich,
4 SAGE Open
Spada, and Allen (1985) to identify the communicative
features of the lessons.
Structured interview (students): To test the basic commu-
nication abilities of the learners, the speaking test of the
Cambridge Key English for Schools Test (Cambridge
English: Key English Test, n.d.) was used because
Cambridge English: Key (KET) is an elementary level
qualification set at Level A2 of the Common European
Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).
However, in Part 2 of the test, some adaptations were
made to suit the learners' social context.
Procedure of the Data Collection
After obtaining permission from the principal and the teacher,
the researcher first observed a lesson conducted at School A
by a male English teacher for Grade 10 students. It was a
speaking activity in which one student interviewed his or her
friend to find out his future plans after he or she leaves the
school. The lesson was video recorded from the beginning to
the end. After the lesson, the researcher, with the teacher's
permission, selected 15 students (seven boys and eight girls)
randomly from the same class, and they were interviewed
after the school in their classroom. The same procedure was
followed with School B to gather research data.
Ethical Consideration
The researcher obtained the permission from the principals
of the two schools after explaining the purpose of the study,
and then met the two teachers and explained to them the pur-
pose of the research. The two teachers voluntarily agreed to
conduct lessons for the researcher to observe and video
record the classroom activities. For ethical reasons, the
teachers and the students were informed that the data col-
lected from them would be used for study purposes only.
Furthermore, the researcher got the participants' permission
to publish the date (samples of spoken data) anonymously in
any referred local or international journal.
Data Analysis
Analysis of the Data Collected Through Class
Observation From Students in Both Schools
Analysis of the data of the classroom interactions of both
schools was done by using the COLT scheme designed by
Fröhlich et al. (1985). The COLT scheme was selected to ana-
lyze the classroom data because the COLT analysis can quan-
tify the teacher­pupil interactions in relation to the type of
activities (group work or individual). In addition, it includes
the modalities in which the students were engaged in each
lesson as well as the type of learning materials and the way
L1 and the target language were used in the class. Moreover,
the COLT scheme can address the research questions posed at
the beginning of this study. Finally, the analyses of the two
lessons and interview data were used to answer the two
research questions posed as well as to accept or refute the two
hypotheses postulated at the beginning of the study. Table 1
shows the summary of the lesson conducted in School A, the
time taken at each stage of the lesson, and the behavior of the
teacher and the students.
Analysis of the lesson using COLT. As Table 1 indicates, the les-
son was based on interviewing a friend to find out his or her
future plans after he or she left school. The COLT analysis
category "Participant organization" provides opportunities to
analyze the ways in which the students were organized
within the task. Table 2 shows the participant organization of
the lesson as a percentage of class time. The total duration of
the lesson was 45 min.
As indicated in Table 2 below, the students involved in
whole class, pair, and individual work in this lesson. Most of
the class time (60%) was spent on student-involved activi-
ties, while the teacher played the role of a facilitator.
Individual and pair work occupied the 48% of the class time.
Most students involved in the activity, and only four pairs
could not present their interviews due to time constraints.
As noted above, according to the COLT scheme, the next
category is material which is discussed below. The teacher
used the pupils' textbook to teach the lesson. Table 3 indi-
cates the main modality for the majority of students as a
percentage of class time. According to Table 3, most stu-
dents spent a good amount of class time (40%) for speaking,
while this lesson also involved the students in listening
(22%), reading (8%), writing (22%), and presentation (4%)
of the class time.
The content category in COLT scheme refers to the subject
matter of the activities. It includes what the teacher and the
students were talking, reading, writing about, or listening.
The content of the lesson was an interview to find out what
they wanted to do after they left school. The teacher used sev-
eral structural patterns to ask questions and also to answer
them using different structures such as I wish to be/I would
like to be/I plan to do/I am going to be. The topic for the inter-
view was selected from the class textbook (Educational
Publications Department­Sri Lanka, 2014). Concerning com-
municative activities embedded in the materials, it can be said
that this particular lesson was communicative, in that it
included an information gap activity in which one student
knew something (what he or she was going to be in the future)
while the other did not know. Moreover, the speaker had a
choice of what he or she would say and how he or she would
say it (I wish to be/I would like to be/I plan to do). According
to Johnson and Morrow (1981), another communicative fea-
ture of the activity above is the feedback, which the speaker
receives from his or her listener (Johnson & Morrow, 1981).
During the presentation, it was observed that several students
who played the role of interviewer provided the interviewee
with feedback using utterance such as "Really, that's great,"
"I'm happy to hear that you want to be a nurse. I also like to
help sick people." Moreover, the situation presented in the

5 Greets the class and introduces today's lesson using
L2 (interviewing a friend to find out his or her
future plans). Gets students elicit language used
when interviewing someone to ask about his or
her future plans: "What are you going to do after
you leave school?" "What is your ambition in the
future?" "What do you hope to do in the future
after leaving school?"
Listen to the teacher and answer
teacher's question in L1 from time
to time.
 4 Speaks out the questions which are supposed to be
used by the interviewer and writes them on the
blackboard one by one. Teacher names a student
and asks, "What are you going to do after you leave
school?" Teacher praises the boy who answered his
question and asks a girl the same question.
Students repeat the questions after
the teacher and keep silent. A boy
stands and answers, "Business"
The girl says that she wants to be a
nurse in the future.
 5 Teacher says, "Now we will learn how to answer
the question," "What are you going to do after
you leave school?" in different ways. Teacher
introduces different structures such as "I wish to
be a businessman," "I would like to be an engineer,"
"I plan to be a doctor." Teacher writes these
structures as full sentences on the blackboard.
Students write them down in their
note books.
 4 Teacher asks the class to open their English textbook
and refer to page 35. Teacher explains the activity
to the class in L1 and tells them to do it in pairs.
Teacher clarifies that they should ask two questions.
Teacher writes them on the blackboard: (a) What
are you going to do after you leave school? (b) How
are you going to serve the country? To answer
the second question, you can say, an example: "By
becoming a businessman, I help people to buy the
goods they want."
Students take out the book, refer to
the right page, get into pairs. One
female student asks the teacher,
how many questions she should ask
her friend.
 5 Gets the class to do the interview activity pair by pair.
Teacher monitors and answers students' questions,
and corrects mistakes. Teacher limits the time of
the activity to 5 min, and after that each pair should
present their interview in front of the class.
Students write the questions and
answers in their note books before
they do the interview. They need
more guidance for the second
question (How are you going to
serve the country?) as it demands
more thinking and linguistic
resources.
 2 After the given time is over, teacher asks the class to
stop practicing the activity and be ready to present
it to the class.
A few pairs say that they have not
finished. Others say that they want
the teacher to check their answers.
 2 Teacher asks if there are any volunteers to present
their interview before the class.
One pair raise their hands and go
before the class with their note
books in hands, and do their
interview, while others are looking
at them patiently.
 2 Teachers praise the first pair for presenting their
interview voluntarily and asks, "What about boys?"
Teacher does not permit them but asks them to
come before the class without being shy.
A pair of boys ask the teacher if they
can do the activity by being at the
same place.
A pair go before the class and do their
interview (They look at what they
have already written and read out as
the first pair did).
 14 Names another pair from girls and asks them to do
the activity. At the end, teacher praises the pair
and asks to go back to their seats. Like this, teacher
continues with seven pairs.
The nominated pair come before the
class and do the activity and go back
to their seats, while the rest of the
class listens.
 2 Teacher announces to the class that he is going to
stop the activity as the time is over and tells that
those who did not present will be presented in the
next class. Teacher greets the class and ends the
activity.
The class greets the teacher.
Note. Nine pairs presented, while four pairs did not.

activity above is related to real world that students are going
to experience once they leave the classroom. Adherents of
CLT favor the idea that the use of real-world activities will
help students transfer what they learn in the classroom to the
outside world (Larsen-Freeman, 2000; Nunan, 1981; Ortega,
2007). Table 4 below presents the summary of the lesson con-
ducted in School B.
Analysis of the lesson using COLT. As Table 4 indicates, the les-
son was based on how to ask for and give directions in a
given social situation. Table 5 shows the participant organi-
zation (COLT) of the lesson as a percentage of class time.
The total duration of the lesson was 47 min. As indicated in
Table 5 below, the students were involved in whole class and
pair work in this lesson. A little amount of class time (27%)
was spent for teacher­student interactions because these stu-
dents are from Grade 10, and the majority could understand
the teacher's instruction although they could not express
themselves. Pair work occupied 21% of the class time, which
is relatively higher than School A. Some pairs were not
actively involved in the practice stage, and eight pairs were
not able to present their dialogue due to time constraints.
As indicated in Tables 5 and 6, according to the content
category in COLT scheme, the content of the lesson was to
teach how to ask for and give directions to people in real-
world situations. The teacher began her lesson with some
questions posed to the class to identify whether the stu-
dents could decide what they would do in a situation where
they wanted to get to a certain place but did not know how
to get there. Several students answered the teacher cor-
rectly, and the topic for the lesson was selected from the
pupils' textbook. The students made use of 48% of the
class time for practicing the dialogue and speaking it out.
Given the time taken for speaking, it can be stated that the
teacher was able to achieve the objective of this lesson to a
good extent.
As noted above, the next category of the COLT scheme is
material where the teacher used the pupils' textbook to teach
the lesson--On Your Way (Educational Publications
Department-Sri Lanka, 2014). The dialogue, which takes
place between two boys, is that one wants to drink a cup of
tea and he does not know how to get to a nearby hotel, so he
asks the other boy for the directions to go to the hotel. The
dialogue is scripted, and it is manageable by the students as
it contains short utterances.
Analysis of the data collected through structured interview from
students in Schools A and B. As described in "Data Collec-
tion Tools," to test the basic communication skills of the
students in both school students, Cambridge Key English
for Schools Speaking Test was used. However, it should be
noted that these students need to acquire academic lan-
guage proficiency as they progress from school to higher
education because most of the educational and profes-
sional programs in higher education contexts are con-
ducted in the medium of English. The speaking test
consisted of two parts. In the first part, each candidate
interacted with the researcher, using the language normally
associated with giving factual information of a personal
kind. Part 2 was based on prompt cards, and the interaction
was between two candidates. The researcher read out the
instruction and gave a question card to Candidate A and
answer card to Candidate B. After the candidates had asked
and answered the questions, they changed the cards and
did the same. Each part of the test was scored out of 10.
Table 7 shows the descriptive statistics of the speaking test
marks obtained by the students in both schools for the Key
English Speaking Test.
According to the descriptive statistics shown in Table 7,
the students in both schools performed equally well in gen-
eral. However, in part wise, the results indicated that the
students in both schools performed well only in the first
part of the test. When it came to the second part of the test,
a majority of students in both schools did not perform well
because the second part included an information gap activ-
ity in which two candidates were expected to ask each
other questions to which they did not know the answers.
According to Underhill (1987), these kinds of tasks have
the advantage of producing concrete evidence of oral pro-
ficiency or the lack of it. Moreover, the test results show
the t value to be 0.66 and the p value to be .50, and these
statistics indicate that the two samples are not significantly
different at p < .05.

Asking for
and giving

5 Greets the class and takes the class attendance, and then
teacher asks the class a question: "What will you do if
you want to go to a certain place but do not know how
to get there?" Teacher checks if the class understand the
question by asking, "Do you understand the question?" in
the students' first language. Teacher praises the students
who give correct answers to her question
A few students answer "Yes" but others
remain silent. The students who
understood the question give various
answers as it is an open question.
Some say, "Ask from someone who
knows how to get there." Others
say, "We can use a map to find the
direction to that place" while some
remain silent but listening.
 3 Teacher tells students that they are going to do a role-play
about asking and giving directions today. Teacher asks the
class to open their English book and turn to page 13 (on
your way). Teacher asks the class to skim it quickly.
Students skim the written dialogue
quickly and some say finish, while the
others still keep on skimming.
 5 Teacher asks a few questions such as "What is the dialogue
about?" "What are the names of the two boys?" "Who
wants to drink a cup of tea?" "Where is Leaf Café?"
"What street does Arjun find when he turns left?"
A few students (about four) respond
correctly to the teacher's questions.
But most do not.
 3 Teacher asks the class to listen to her while she reads the
dialogue loudly, and then the teacher tells them to repeat
the dialogue after her.
Teacher writes the following words on the blackboard "turn
right/left, landmarks, pleasure" asks the class whether they
know the meanings of them. Teacher explains the meaning
of pleasure to them by providing the first language
equivalent.
Students listen to the teacher, and then
repeat after the teacher.
Most of the girls in the class say that
they understand the meaning and they
tell the meaning in their first language
too except pleasure. Students write
the words and their meanings in their
mother tongue in their note books.
 4 Teacher asks the class to practice the dialogue. First, she
divides the class into two halves (boys and girls). She
assigns Arjun's role to boys and Bhuwane's role to girls,

Teacher then and there corrects students' pronunciation
problems. When the dialogue is finished speaking, she says
good, and then students are put into pairs (boys with boys
and girls with girls) and asks them to practice the dialogue
several times changing their roles.
Boys start at the teacher's command and
say loudly, "Excuse me" by looking at
the textbook. Then girls reply, "Yes,
what can I do for you?" and then boys
reply, "Can you tell me where I can
have a cup of tea?" Some boys don't
say anything just looking at the text.
Like this, they continue until all lines of
the dialogue have been spoken.

The first pair (two girls) come forward

to come and enact their dialogue.
Boys show reluctance first but with the

Findings
Findings related to classroom observation of School A. The spo-
ken data gathered from two video-recordings were tran-
scribed separately. The researcher first analyzed the spoken
data gathered from School A using COLT. After analyzing
the data, it was found that the teacher used the Audio Lingual
Teaching method to teach an oral task with some communi-
cative features present in the lesson. However, the lesson
was not fully communicative. Even though the teacher in
School A was quite successful in using the target language in
classroom instruction, the teacher displayed some problems
relating to pronunciation in particular and language fluency
in general. Moreover, the students did not speak in a natural
way where they did not display any features of spoken lan-
guage such as body language or discourse markers (well,
right, yes, oh); instead, they read out the dialogue to the class
by looking at their note books. The activity was based on the
learners' textbook in which one student required to ask for
directions to get to a certain place, while the other had to tell
the directions. In an activity like this, learners should use
body language to make the spoken language more meaning-
ful and effective for the listener to understand. Therefore,
given what was observed in the classroom in School A, the
researcher believes that the teacher was not entirely informed
of the CLT approach.
Findings related to classroom observation of School B.The
instructional procedure that the teacher carried out with
Grade 10 children in School B was not much different from
School A. However, in terms of content, focus, and organiza-
tion of the activity, it was much better than School A. The
teacher used the target language in classroom proficiently.
The teacher started the activity with a good introduction and
tried to elicit more language from the class. Particularly, the
girls were very interested in the activity and they wanted to
communicate. They got into pairs and practiced the activity
with the guidance of the teacher and presented it in front of
the class, showing several features of natural speech such as
eye contact and discourse markers to a certain extent even
though they also used their note books. However, the boys
just read their scripts from the note books showing no fea-
tures of spoken language as most of the students in School A
did. It was further noted that boys, except a very few, seemed
to have no interest in the activity.
Discussion
Discussion related to the first and second research questions.The
first research question the researcher formed at the beginning
of the study was "Why do a majority of students in rural
schools show a low or limited oral proficiency in the target
language?" To answer the first question, the researcher
formed the following hypothesis that a majority of students
studying in rural schools have a low or limited oral profi-
ciency in the target language. This study has shown that the
students in rural schools do not receive adequate language
input (Krashen & Terrell, 1983) that leads to oral proficiency
of the learners. The researcher's classroom observation and
the analysis of the classroom interactions clearly indicate
that students of the two schools have potential and willing-
ness to communicate in the target language but the pedagogi-
cal constraints imposed by the teachers were a barrier for
them to interact in the class. Another crucial factor that
emerged from the study can be ascribed to the teachers' fail-
ure to provide learners with communicative activities in the
classroom context in which learners can practice and use the
target language with ease.
The teaching approach employed by the two teachers in
their class activities was not fully communicative oriented
even though the classroom in School B displayed some fea-
tures of communication focus class where students were

allowed to interact with each other using the target language
to a certain extent. Interaction has been identified as a neces-
sary condition for language acquisition (Long, 1981; Pica,
1994) even though interaction hypothesis has been subjected
to criticism from several theoretical perspectives. The stu-
dents in School A tended to read out the scripted dialogues
from the textbook, while the students in School B chose to
read the dialogue which they had already written in their note
books. Given both situations, it can be argued that both
teachers did not make use of the activities so interactive and
engaging that learners could not use the target language
authentically. This kind of classroom practice will not guar-
antee learners that they will become proficient users of the
target language once they leave the classroom.
As the researcher has argued earlier, neither of the two
teachers the researcher observed used the speaking activities
in such a stimulating way that triggers interest in students to
continue doing it. If the teachers had been careful in planning
out their speaking activities, the learners would have been
motivated to do them as if they were doing in real world. The
teacher who was from School A should have created the
classroom into an imaginary town just by moving desks and
chairs to look like streets of a town and asked the learners to
enact the situation where a student wanted to find out the
way to a restaurant. Likewise, the teachers should have cre-
ated several situations where actually people ask for direc-
tions to get to places they want. Given the factors described
above concerning the status of rural students' oral profi-
ciency, the first research hypothesis which the researcher
formed that a majority of students studying in rural schools
have a low or limited oral proficiency in the target language
can be accepted. Likewise, the second research question
which the researcher posed in this study was, "Do a majority
of teachers of English in rural schools apply CLT approach in
their teaching?" In order to answer this question, the
researcher formed the following hypothesis that a majority
of English teachers teaching in rural schools use the CLT
approach in their classroom teaching can now be answered
with evidence to prove that a majority English teachers
teaching in rural schools are deviant from application of CLT
approach in classroom teaching. The methodology that the
teacher in School A used, as described in the section
"Findings Related to Classroom Observation of School A,"
was the audio lingual method in which a lesson is generally
taught using the P-P-P cycle (Presentation, Practice, and
Production; Richards, 2006), which has been strongly dis-
credited and criticized for its principles are based on behav-
iorist theory (Larsen-Freeman, 2000). The teacher in School
B used the speaking activity in line with some aspects of
language (purpose, setting, role, communicative event, lan-
guage functions, grammatical and lexical contents; Richards,
2006) that are said to be necessary for developing communi-
cative competence. The greatest weakness that was observed
in School B teacher could be ascribed to her negligence of
the communicative aspects of language as stated above and
her unawareness of the extent to which her role as a teacher
should change in line with ESL/EFL pedagogy that has
undergone many changes at present than it used to be a few
decades ago. Given the factors described above, the second
hypothesis which states that a majority of English teachers in
rural schools use CLT in their classroom teaching can be
refuted due to the lack of evidence to accept it.
Limitations of the Study
Even though the results of the present study indicated that
the oral proficiency of the study groups was low or limited
due to the fact that the teachers did not effectively use com-
municative activities in classroom situation, there are limita-
tions which must be acknowledged. The first limitation is the
sample selection. Even though the two student samples
selected from two different schools were from a student pop-
ulation, the sample size was limited to 54 participants; there-
fore, the results of this study cannot be generalized to a
bigger population of school students who study English in
rural contexts in or out of Sri Lanka. The second limitation is
that the outcomes of this study cannot be generalized to
learners studying in schools with more opportunities to use
English for communicative purposes. Further research is
needed to make a more informed decision as to why a major-
ity of students in rural schools fail to achieve oral proficiency
in the target language.
Implications and Recommendations
In answering the research questions, the researcher investi-
gated the classroom practices carried out in L2 classroom in
Sri Lankan rural school contexts and found that the current
instructional practices in rural schools are deviant from the
CLT. The study, furthermore, found that the English teachers
were in need of proper training which should coincide with
the current theoretical, empirical, and pedagogical views of
SLA. During the investigation, it, moreover, became evident
that the English Pupils Textbook series introduced by the
Department of Educational Publications (DEP) under the
directives of the National Institute of Education (NIE) in Sri
Lanka highly focus on reading, writing, and grammar while
listening and speaking skills are slightly tackled and some
speaking activities are intended for writing rather than speak-
ing. The instructional manuals produced by the NIE show
instances of mismatch with the textbook series where either
the material producers or the manual producers have failed to
come into a common agreement concerning the objectives of
teaching and learning the target language.
Concerning the application, the researcher concludes that
the classroom practices currently used in rural schools are
not effective in promoting oral proficiency in L2 learners.
Therefore, the researcher believes that providing learners
with adequate opportunities to interact in the target language
in the class and delivering instruction through unorthodox
10 SAGE Open
teaching approaches will promote students' oral proficiency.
Moreover, using learner authentic materials in classroom
teaching will help learners produce authentic language spo-
ken by real people outside the classroom.
Conclusion
This study has focused on the instructional practices of local
L2 teachers teaching in rural state schools in Sri Lanka and
its relevance to current theoretical, empirical, and pedagogi-
cal perspectives of SLA. The study, which was conducted in
two Sri Lankan state schools, revealed that instructional
practices and teaching materials are not effective enough to
help students improve their oral communication as the teach-
ing practices and materials are rather deviant from the prin-
ciples of CLT. Therefore, based on the findings of the current
study, it is suggested that using unorthodox teaching
approaches and classroom techniques along with the appro-
priate materials can help students studying English in rural
contexts improve their oral proficiency.
