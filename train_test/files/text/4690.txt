Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly occur-
ring cancer and cause of cancer death for both men and
women in the United States population, and represents 9%
of all cancer deaths for both men and women.1 In 2013, an
estimated 102,480 new cases were diagnosed.1 Among
colorectal cancer patients, approximately 90% of those
diagnosed with localized disease will survive five years, but
5-year survival decreases to 68% if lymph nodes are
involved, and to 10% if patients have evidence of metastatic

Abstract
Background. Chinese herbal medicines reportedly increase efficacy and minimize toxicity of chemotherapy; however, little
attention has been paid to how poor study quality can bias outcomes. Methods. We systematically searched MEDLINE,
TCMLARS, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials of Chinese herbal medicines combined with
fluorouracil-based chemotherapy compared with the same chemotherapy alone. We screened for eligibility, extracted
data, and pooled data with random-effects meta-analysis. Outcome measures were survival, toxicity, tumor response,
performance status, quality of life, and Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB) criteria to critically evaluate the quality of reporting
in the randomized trials included in the meta-analysis. Results. We found 36 potentially eligible studies, with only 3 (those
with low ROB) qualifying for meta-analysis. Two reported chemotherapy-related diarrhea reduced by 57% (relative risk
[RR] = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.19-1.01; I2 test for variation in RR due to heterogeneity = 0.0%), with nonsignificant results.
Two reported white blood cell toxicity reduced by 66% (RR = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.16-0.72; I2 test for variation in RR due
to heterogeneity = 0.0%), with statistically significant results. Stratifying analysis by studies with high versus low ROB, we
found substantial overestimation of benefit: Studies with high ROB overestimated by nearly 2-fold reduction of platelet
toxicity by Chinese herbal medicines (RR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.15-0.84 vs RR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.11-3.92). Studies with high
ROB overestimated by nearly 2-fold reduction of vomiting toxicity (RR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.33-0.61 vs RR = 0.87, 95%
CI = 0.48-1.58). And, studies with high ROB overestimated by 21% the reduction in diarrhea toxicity (RR = 0.34, 95%
CI = 0.20-0.58 vs RR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.19-1.01). Studies with high ROB also overestimated by 16% improvement in
tumor response (RR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.18-1.63 vs RR = 1.20; 95% CI = 0.81-1.79). Not accounting for ROB would have
exaggerated evidence of benefit and failed to detect nonsignificance of results. Conclusions. In the present analysis, involving
36 studies, 2593 patients, 20 outcomes, 36 medical institutions, and 271 named research authors, 92% of the data points
were from studies at high ROB. Given the poor quality of the data in studies identified, it cannot be concluded whether
combining Chinese herbs with chemotherapy reduces toxicity of chemotherapy.

spread at the time they are diagnosed.2 CRC patients with
pre-existing diabetes mellitus have an increased risk of
short and long-term mortality, post-operative complica-
tions, and 5-year cancer recurrence.3
First-line Therapies
Surgical resection is essential, and staging with sampling of
at least 12 adjacent lymph nodes draining the tumor site
provides important prognostic information.4 While adju-
vant radiation therapy was in the past frequently included in
treatment regimens, its use is now limited to treating
patients who have advanced retroperitoneal tumors and for
patients with rectal tumors.5
The earliest established adjuvant chemotherapy treat-
ment was 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), has been in continuous use
since 1957. Important improvements in the efficacy of 5-FU
were the Mayo Clinic and Roswell Park protocols,6,7 which
improved median survival in patients with metastatic dis-
ease to 11 months, compared with 5 months with supportive
therapy.8 Efficacy of 5-FU/leucovorin has been signifi-
cantly improved by combination with irinotecan and oxali-
platin for metastatic patients.9-12 Another significant new
treatment development was the advent of FOLFOX
regimens, which by adding oxaliplatin to 5-FU/leucovorin
improved response rates and survival.13 Among metastatic
patients, alternating FOLFOX and FOLFIRI protocols has
helped achieve even greater survival outcomes when com-
pared to 5-FU alone.14,15 However, more than 70% of
patients receiving FOLFOX suffer from thrombocytopenia,
and approximately 15% of patients receiving oxaliplatin
exhibit a hypersensitivity reaction with 2% of patients hav-
ing severe reactions. Serious complications of immune-
mediated thrombocytopenia may occur if blood count and
bleeding symptoms are not monitored after the appearance
of oxaliplatin-induced hypersensitivity.16
Another important addition to treatment options has
been the oral 5-FU pro-drug, capecitabine, which is fre-
quently combined with irinotecan and oxaliplatin.17 Newly
discovered genetic variations have helped to better under-
stand variations in treatment success with irinotecan and
5-FU. Among patients treated with irinotecan and 5-FU,
carriers of the ABCB1 haplotype not only responded to
treatment less frequently, but also had a shorter survival
time.18 Additionally, patients in whom there were genetic
variations of the ABCB1 haplotype experienced earlier
onset of toxicity and reduced effectiveness of irinotecan and
5-FU.18
Improved clinical outcomes have been found with the
combined treatment of cetuximab, 5-FU/leucovorin and
oxaliplatin (FOLFOX6) or irinotecan (FOLFIRI) for
patients with the KRAS wild-type gene compared with
KRAS mutated mCRC.19 Newly developed monoclonal
antibodies include both bevacizumab, which specifically
targets circulating vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) and cetuximab, which has an affinity for the epi-
thelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)20,21. Adding the
monoclonal antibody bevacizumab to chemotherapy has
significantly increased progression-free survival by 17.1%,
and overall survival by 8.6%.22 However, a limiting factor
to this protocol is hypertension. Significant increase was
shown in progression-free survival of 3.7 and 4.4 months,
respectively, in a meta-analysis of bevacizumab in combi-
nation with 5-FU/FA, and bevacizumab in combination
with irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin (IFL), as first-
line treatments of CRC.23
Herbal Therapies
Preliminary data have been published in cell culture, ani-
mal, and human trial studies suggesting Chinese herbal
medicine may have an adjunctive role in colorectal cancer
therapy. Mechanistic data have been published supporting
the plausibility of Chinese herbal medicine having clinical
benefit through either improving host defense or directly
inhibiting tumor growth.
Inhibition of tumor cell growth and upregulation of
apoptosis have been observed in colon cancer cell culture
models using crude extracts from Chinese herbal medi-
cines such as Radix Eleutherococcus senticosus,24 and
Ganoderma lucidum.25 Inhibition of tumor cell growth has
also been observed using well-characterized purified
extracts, including curcumin (from turmeric root, Rhizoma
Curcuma longa),26 allicin (from garlic, Bulbus Allium sati-
vum),27,28 epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, from green tea,
Folium Thea sinensis),29,30 genistein (from the soybean,
Semen Glycine max),31 and tanshinones (from Radix Salvia
miltiorrhiza).32 Tumor inhibition has also been demon-
strated in animal models: honokiol (from Cortex Magnolia
officinalis),33 and triptolide (from Radix Trypterygium
wilfordii).34
Suppression of colon cancer metastasis has been demon-
strated with the herbal extract fucoidan (from the seaweeds
Kun Bu and Hai Zao, Sargassum),35 and the herbal combi-
nation Pien Tze Huang.36
Anti-tumor effects of Chinese herbal medicines have
also been identified as acting through multiple molecular
pathways: inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases with Sargassum,35
Fas receptor upregulation, and caspase activation, and
reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP,
Psim) with Bax protein activation and cytochrome c release
with Cortex Morus alba.37
Improvements in host defense mechanisms have also
been observed, which may contribute to improved survival
and quality of life. These data include reversal of muscle
cell atrophy in cachexia induced by Rhizoma Anemarrhena
asphodeloides and Cortex Phellodendron amurense,38

reduction of gastrointestinal dysfunction following colon

Jian Zhong Tang,39 reduction of FOLFOX6-related periph-
eral neuropathy with herbal combination Niu Che Sen Qi
Wan,40 and reduction of post­colorectal surgical time to tol-
erance of regular diet with the combinations Da Jian Zhong
Tang and Gui Zhi Fu Ling Tang.41 Chinese herbal medi-
cines may derive their reported benefit for colon cancer
patients because they are typically used in multi-ingredient
combination formulas, thus taking advantage of multiple
pathways of therapeutic action.
Prior meta-analysis of randomized trials of Chinese
herbal medicine in colorectal cancer has shown a modest
increase in 1-year survival (odds ratio [OR] 2.41, 95% CI
1.32-4.41) and 3-year survival (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.49-
3.87), reduction in cancer progression (OR 0.50, 95% CI
0.32-0.77), and improved quality of life (OR 3.43, 95% CI
2.35-5.02).42 However, the authors did not critically evalu-
ate study quality. In the current article, we sought to criti-
cally examine the evidence for effectiveness of Chinese
herbal medicines in colon cancer patients, with particular
emphasis on study quality. We decided to identify for our
systematic search and meta-analysis those published ran-
domized trials using fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in
both treatment and control groups because this therapy is a
key component of most standard front-line treatment proto-
cols for colorectal cancer.
Materials and Methods
Systematic Search
We conducted systematic searches of TCMLARS (1984 to
2014; www.cintcm.com), PubMed (1966 to 2014),
Cochrane Library (1988 to 2014), and the Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials (1966 to 2014). We sought all
randomized trials in any language, to reduce the risk of lan-
guage bias seen in previous systematic reviews of Chinese
herbal medicine.43 We sought studies reporting on the use of
Chinese herbal medicine combined with fluorouracil-based
chemotherapy for colorectal cancer patients compared to
chemotherapy alone, and synonyms for each term. We also
explored references from bibliographies of identified stud-
ies. We first screened titles and abstracts, ordered poten-
tially relevant full-text articles, and subsequently screened
those articles prior to data extraction (Figure 1).
Study Eligibility
Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials recruiting
patients with colon cancer, with allocation to either Chinese
herbal medicines combined with fluorouracil-based combi-
nation chemotherapy or the same chemotherapy alone,
reporting at least one outcome of interest (survival, toxicity,
tumor response, performance status and quality of life), with
enough detail to allow calculation of risk ratios. We followed
a predefined protocol for our systematic review (protocol
not registered), which included the PRISMA Statement
guidelines (Supplemental Materials available at http://ict.
sagepub.com/content/by/supplemental-data).44
Data Extraction
Three researchers fluent in both Chinese and English
(M.M., H.L., and C.S.) extracted data on treatment details,
patient characteristics, study quality and clinical outcomes.
We grouped studies by outcome of interest for analysis.
Only outcomes with 2 or more studies found were included
in quantitative meta-analyses.
Study Quality
We used the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias
(ROB) criteria to critically evaluate the quality of report-
ing in the randomized trials included in the meta-analysis,
for adequate random sequence allocation, group alloca-
tion concealment, participant blinding, completeness of
outcome reporting, freedom from selective outcome
reporting, and other potential sources of bias.45 Each of
these 7 items on the ROB assessment tool was given a
possible score by the assessor of 0 for low, 1 for medium
and 2 for high ROB. The total is then combined to give an
overall ROB score. Low ROB was assigned to studies
with total score 0 to 4, medium ROB with total score 5 to
8, and high ROB with total score of 9 and higher, an
approach similar to that used by previous researchers in
applying the Cochrane ROB tool.46 The total possible
score was 12, consisting of a range of 0, 1, or 2 for each
scored quality item (Table 1).
Analysis of Outcomes
Survival was defined as the number of patients who died
at intervals of 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years following com-
pletion of chemotherapy. Probability of failure (death)
was calculated by the number of patients in the Chinese
herbal medicine plus chemotherapy group, divided by that
same number in the chemotherapy-only group. Intention-
to-treat analysis was used, treating in the analysis any non-
reported patients at follow-up times as having failed. A
relative risk of less than one would indicate the Chinese
herbal medicine plus fluorouracil-based chemotherapy
conferred a survival advantage, compared to the same che-
motherapy alone.
Reduction of ChemotherapyToxicity. Most studies identified in
our search used the 5-point World Health Organization
288 Integrative Cancer Therapies 15(3)
(WHO) scale to report severity of chemotherapy-related tox-
icity. We calculated toxicity reduction in each study as the
number of patients reporting severe toxicity (WHO grades 2
or higher), divided by the total number in each group of
treatment (WHO grades 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4). The risk reduc-
tion was then calculated as toxicity reduction in the herbal
medicine plus chemotherapy group, divided by that in the
chemotherapy alone group. A relative risk of less than 1
would favor the herbal/chemotherapy combination therapy.
Objective Tumor Response. We calculated tumor response as
the total number of patients experiencing complete as well
as partial response divided by the total number in each treat-
ment group (complete response, partial response, no change,
and progressive disease). The relative risk of tumor response
was calculated as the probability of tumor response in the
Chinese medicine plus chemotherapy group, divided by the
total in the chemotherapy-only group. A relative risk of
more than 1 would favor the combination treatment
regimen.
Performance Status.All studies reporting performance
status used the Karnofsky Performance Scale; most used
a 10-point change as a cutoff for worsening or improve-
ment of performance status, a few used a 20-point change
as a cutoff. We chose to calculate performance status as a
proportion of improved or stable status: (greater than 10
point increase and no change) divided by a total status (no
change plus greater than 10-point increase or greater than
10-point decrease). The relative risk of improved or sta-
ble status for this meta-analysis included the Chinese
medicine plus fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in the
numerator, divided by this proportion in the fluorouracil-
based chemotherapy treatment group. A relative risk of
greater than 1 would support the combination treatment
regimen.

Meta-Analysis, Between-study Heterogeneity, and Publication
Bias. We performed random-effects meta-analysis using the
-metan- command in the Stata software package (Stata
Corp, College Station, TX), and the I2 measure to evaluate
between-study heterogeneity.47 The Harbord test was used
to evaluate publication bias,48 and the I2 measure to evaluate
between-study heterogeneity.47

retrospective study (n = 3),51-53 or meta-analysis (n = 1),54 or
because the study design had no herb + chemo group
(n = 1),55 there were no usable outcomes (n = 8),56-63 other
cancers were included in the data reported (n = 5),63-67 or
stage was not specified (n = 2).68,69 This yielded 36 studies
for our meta-analysis (Figure 1).
In data extraction of these 36 studies, we found data
potentially eligible for meta-analysis for reduction of che-
motherapy toxicity (anemia, diarrhea, fatigue, kidney toxic-
ity, liver toxicity, neurological toxicity, performance status,
platelet toxicity, vomiting, white blood cell [WBC] toxicity)
and recurrence, survival, and tumor response. However, of
these 36 studies, we found only 3 that qualified for data anal-
ysis and reporting on the basis of our predefined eligibility
criteria: those studies that (a) had low risk of bias (Cochrane
ROB tool), (b) were free of publication bias based on the
Harbord test,48 and (c) had low between-study heterogeneity
(Table 1).70-72
These 3 studies provided sufficient data for meta-analysis
for the following 6 outcomes: reduction of diarrhea toxic-
ity,71,72 neurotoxicity,71,72 platelet toxicity,71,72 vomiting,71,72
WBCtoxicity71,72 (allonWHOscale)andtumorresponse.70,71
Two of these 3 studies were based on the Chinese herbal
medicine Astragalus membranaceus.70,72 Clinical outcomes
are reported in Table 2, and each study's treatment character-
istics in Table 3.
For an additional 2 outcomes, there was only 1 study
identified per outcome, which made formal meta-analysis
not possible: reduction in anemia toxicity (WHO scale),71
and improvement in Karnofsky Performance Status.71
Reduction of DiarrheaToxicity (WHO Scale 2). In meta-anal-
ysis, we found 2 high-quality (low risk of bias) studies
reporting that addition of Chinese herbal medicine to fluo-
rouracil-based chemotherapy reduced the relative risk of
severity of diarrhea toxicity (WHO Scale 2) by 57% (rela-
tive risk [RR] 0.43; 95% CI 0.19-1.01); however, results
were not statistically significant (P = .05; Figure 2),71,72
with P < .05 defined as the upper bound of statistical
significance.
Reduction of NeurologicalToxicity (WHO Scale 2). We found 2
high-quality (low risk of bias) studies reporting that addition
of Chinese herbal medicine to fluorouracil-based chemother-
apy reduced the relative risk of severity of neurological tox-
icity (WHO Scale 2) by 21% (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.31-
1.31); however, results were not statistically significant
(P = .27).71,72
Reduction of Platelet Toxicity (WHO Scale 2).We found 2
high-quality (low risk of bias) studies reporting that addition
of Chinese herbal medicine to fluorouracil-based chemo-
therapy reduced the relative risk of severity of platelet toxic-
ity (WHO Scale 2) by 35% (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.11-3.92),
although results were not statistically significant (P = .64;
Figure 3).71,72
Reduction of Vomiting Toxicity (WHO Scale 2).We found 2
high-quality (low risk of bias) studies reporting that addition
of Chinese herbal medicine to fluorouracil-based chemo-
therapy reduced the relative risk of severity of vomiting tox-
icity (WHO Scale 2) by 13% (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.48-1.58),
although results were not statistically significant (P = .64;
Figure 4).71,72
Reduction ofWBCToxicity (WHO Scale 2). We found 2 high-
quality (low risk of bias) studies reporting that addition of
Chinese herbal medicine to fluorouracil-based chemother-
apy reduced the relative risk of severity of WBC toxicity
(WHO Scale 2) by 66% (RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.16-0.72), with
statistically significant results (P < .01; Figure 5).71,72
Improvement of Tumor Response (Partial Response + Complete
Response). We found 2 high-quality (low risk of bias) stud-
ies reporting that addition of Chinese herbal medicine to
fluorouracil-based chemotherapy increase the likelihood of
tumor response (partial response or complete response) by
20% (RR 1.20; 95% CI 0.81-1.79), although the results were
not statistically significant (P = .38; Figure 6).70,71
Comparing Results of Meta-Analysis of StudiesWith HighVersus
Low Risk of Bias. Studies with high ROB overestimated by
21% the reduction in diarrhea toxicity (WHO grade II or
higher): RR = 0.34 (95% CI 0.20-0.58) versus RR = 0.43
(95% CI 0.19-1.01). In this analysis, not accounting for
study ROB would have failed to detect the nonsignificant
result of meta-analysis for reduction of diarrhea toxicity
(Figure 2).
Studies with high ROB overestimated by nearly 2-fold
the reduction in platelet toxicity (WHO grade II or higher):
RR = 0.35 (95% CI 0.15-0.84) versus RR = 0.65 (95% CI
0.11-3.92). In this analysis, not accounting for study ROB
would have failed to detect the nonsignificant result of meta-
analysis for reduction of platelet toxicity (Figure 3).
Studies with high ROB overestimated by nearly 2-fold
the reduction in vomiting toxicity (WHO grade II or higher):
RR = 0.45 (95% CI 0.33-0.61), versus RR = 0.87 (95% CI
0.48-1.58). In this analysis, not accounting for study ROB
would have failed to detect the nonsignificant result of meta-
analysis for reduction of vomiting toxicity (Figure 4).
Studies with high ROB overestimated by 16% the
improvement in objective tumor response: RR = 1.39 (95%
CI 1.18-1.63) versus RR = 1.20 (95% CI 0.81-1.79). In this
analysis, not accounting for study ROB would have failed to
detect the nonsignificant result of meta-analysis for improve-
ment in objective tumor response (Figure 5). Statistically sig-
nificant results on reduction of neurological toxicity were not
found in meta-analysis of studies at either high or low ROB.

aSignificant therapeutic effects were allowed when meta-analysis results satisfied all 4 of these criteria: Within studies with low risk of bias, a significant finding for the pooled relative risk or clinical
benefit, a significant finding of the test for no publication bias, and a nonsignificant finding of the test for between-study heterogeneity.
bIf P < .05: unbalanced effects between studies.
cIf P > .05: evidence of publication bias.
dOnly one study with low risk of bias found for this outcome, so no meta-analysis could be calculated.

McCulloch et al 301
We found no difference in results of meta-analysis com-
paring studies with high ROB versus low ROB for reduc-
tion of WBC toxicity (Figure 6).
Discussion
Our meta-analysis found very limited published evidence
supporting the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicines when
used in combination with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy
for patients with colon cancer. We found qualified report-
able results (those published in articles with low ROB) for
only 20% (n = 4) of the 20 outcomes identified: diarrhea,
neurological, platelet, vomiting, and WBC toxicity (all on
WHO Scale), and objective tumor response. In only 5%
(n = 1) of all outcomes analyzed were the results of the
analysis both at low ROB and also statistically significant:
WBC toxicity.
Study Quality in Articles Assessed
Over the past decade, our team has conducted meta-anal-
yses of Chinese herbal medicines in patients with chronic
hepatitis B,73 advanced non­small cell lung cancer,74 and
hepatocellular carcinoma,75 initially using the Jadad
quality scale.76 The availability in 2011 of the Cochrane
Risk of Bias tool has provided meta-analysts with a
clearly-defined set of metrics with which to efficiently
evaluate the quality of underlying studies.45 This tool
asks analysts to assign to each study being assessed a 0 to
2 score, that in their judgment the study's reporting indi-
cates a low ROB, unclear, or high risk. This is assigned
in 6 domains: adequate random sequence allocation,
group allocation concealment, participant blinding, com-
pleteness of outcome reporting, freedom from selective
outcome reporting, and other potential sources of bias.
This score when totaled is used to assign a low risk (score
0-4), medium (5-8), or high (9-12) risk that the study's
design or outcomes are subject to bias. In effect, it is an
indicator of apparent trustworthiness of the reported
data.
However, 80% of the evidence (16/20 outcomes) we
found has virtually no clinical usefulness, because the arti-
cles in which they were published were at high ROB using
the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.45 Most studies used the out-
dated clinical outcome for chemotherapy toxicity--the
WHO Scale71,72,77-86--a method that is more prone to bias
than the 12-year-old CTCAE scale.87 All studies reporting
patient survival and time to recurrence reported these out-
comes at fixed time points (1, 2, or 3 years),88-93 a method
prone to substantial analytic bias compared to the more

Note: Vertical dashed line indicates the effect size in this analysis.
302 Integrative Cancer Therapies 15(3)
modern hazard ratio method.94 To help understand the
broader scientific context within which our results are
found, we informally compared our results with the find-
ings of other recently published meta-analyses of Chinese
herbal medicines, and found similar issues with study qual-
ity and risk of bias.42,95,96
Limitations
Heavy metal contamination in Chinese herbal medicines
has been reported.97,98 It is additionally known that heavy
metal accumulation can contribute to cancer development,
in part due to increased activation of tumor initiation and
promotion signaling pathway such as epidermal growth fac-
tor receptor (EGFR), phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K),
AKT, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in car-
cinogenesis and cancer progression.99 Therefore, unmea-
sured confounding may exist in our results due to unknown
interaction of heavy metal residues with chemotherapy
efficacy.
Most symptomatic outcomes were measured on the
WHO Scale, which we have specified in the manuscript.
However, several (incidence of diarrhea, fatigue, and
vomiting) were not measured using this scale, and in the
underlying studies analyzed, it is not clear in the reporting
how they were measured, further diminishing the clinical
value of our results.
Conclusions
Although these 36 studies involved 2,593 patients, 20 out-
comes, 36 medical institutions, and 271 named research
authors, unfortunately most of the data points suggesting
clinical benefit are of virtually no clinical value due to very
poor methodological quality of the studies. Because strati-
fying our analysis by the articles' level of risk of bias
showed no statistically significant difference in effect size,
we suggest that virtually all of these studies to some extent
suffer from such risk of bias. Additionally, no studies
reported any adverse effects monitoring associated with
the use of Chinese herbal medicines, a shortcoming com-
mon to many other such RCTs published in China.42,95,96,100
In short, the high frequency of low-quality and/or biased
studies of Chinese herbal medicine undermines confidence
in the results of published meta-analyses of these trials.
This is unfortunate given the wealth of information on
combination therapies available from the tradition of
Chinese medicine. The solutions to these problems may be

found in improved researcher methodology and ethics
training, comprehensive clinical trial oversight, and
reformed medical journal peer-review and editorial
practices.
